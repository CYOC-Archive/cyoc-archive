<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still wanting to follow the male-looking wolf, you decided to head down the corridor labeled &quot;Men&quot;. You encountered a door, beyond which you were met with rows of showers. &quot;I guess it&#39;s more than just a bathroom,&quot; you thought. <br />
<br />
Upon walking past the showers and turning a corner you saw a normal looking, but empty, locker room. Rows of lockers, about 400 total by your best estimate, were lined in 8 neat rows along one wall, with some bathrooms and sinks opposite them. Looking at himself in the mirror above one of the sinks was the grey wolf you had seen walk in earlier, wearing a plain white tank top that looked tight on his muscular frame, a blue pair of stretchy looking shorts, and some funny looking running shoes; probably made specifically to fit over the digitigrade feet of the costume. He was carrying a red duffel bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, excuse me!&quot; you said. The wolf jumped a little and turned to look at you as you started walking to him. You began to take note of the musky smell emanating from him and the sweat stains on his tank top as you got closer. It seemed like he had just finished a workout. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, uh, excuse me, but where did you get your costume?&quot; you asked him. &quot;I couldn&#39;t find any wolf costumes in the store.&quot; <br />
<br />
He perked up, suddenly seeming very interested in what you had just said. &quot;Oh, you want a costume like this one?&quot; His voice sounded muffled, but not incomprehensible. &quot;I got this one in the costume shop ages ago, but maybe they&#39;re out of stock right now. I mean... it is Halloween and all.&quot; You looked down in disappointment. &quot;However, if you want I can let you try on the one I&#39;m wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked back up at him. &quot;Yes, please!&quot; you exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok, I got you. Just one thing first.&quot; He held out his furry, padded right hand. &quot;I need you to shake my hand, and while doing so say &#39;I want to wear your costume.&#39; Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
You were taken a bit aback by his request, but the excitement of getting to wear the costume overwhelmed any suspicions you had. You reached out your right hand to the wolves and grasped it, shaking it and repeating the phrase back to him: &quot;I want to wear your costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt a small shock permeate your body briefly, then heard a click. The wolf reached for his collarbone to feel for something. His hand found a zipper, and pulling it down a little allowed him to remove the mask, revealing his face and his short brown hair. &quot;Ok, &quot; he said, &quot;Let me change out of this for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
He disappeared into one of the showers, where you could hear the sounds of rustling fabric and a zipper being zipped.<br />
<br />
After a minute, the man walked out with regular street clothes, holding his duffel bag and the wolf costume. The wolf costume still had the shorts on as well as socks, but no shoes or tank top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go. Good luck.&quot; He plopped the bundle of fabric into your arms. Before you could say anything, he walked out through the door that you entered, and disappeared. <br />
<br />
You stared at the costume in your hands as you walked towards one of the showers to change. It was a one piece costume, with only a zipper on the front for easy access. It&#39;s grey fur was soft and warm, and at the same time slightly damp from the man&#39;s workout. The mask had a realistic quality to it that was unlike any other you&#39;d ever seen. It&#39;s nose even felt wet to the touch.<br />
<br />
You threw the shower curtain closed, then held the costume up with your hands, allowing you to see the zipper down the belly. Upon opening it you were struck once again by the smell of the man&#39;s musk, wafting from the smooth latex interior of the costume. While you were briefly a bit baffled as to why the man wouldn&#39;t wash it before letting someone else use it, the musk was so strong as to be slightly enchanting, and you felt yourself getting hard, clouding your thoughts. You decided to put it on naked, in your horny stupor, as you took off your shirt and threw it on the ground, followed by your shorts and boxers.<br />
<br />
You proceeded to slide your right foot into the costume, the latex of the costume feeling warm against your skin. You sat down on the small bench inside the shower to put the other foot in, and pulled the costume up to your waist. You stroked the fur on your legs. &quot;Mmm... nice.&quot; you said out loud. You brought the costume up to your chest and slid your left arm into its sleeve. Your fingers slid effortlessly into the gloves at the end. You were enamored with the claws&#39; good dexterity as you wiggled your fingers. You were easily able to slide your other arm into its sleeve. Then you reached behind you for the head. You brought it up above you, then pulled down, plunging you into darkness for a second, until your eyes aligned with the eye holes, which you could see perfectly out of. You adjusted the head until it felt right, then reached for the zipper and pulled it all the way up. You patted the seam to make it less obvious and then tucked the zipper away at the end of the seam.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when you noticed the full-body mirror, which was for some reason just placed directly inside the shower. You stood up to look in the mirror, and you were faced with a wolf staring back at you; a tall, muscular, grey wolf. The only thing you saw in the mirror was your own mouth, agape in astonishment, which was visible through the wolf&#39;s snout when open. When you noticed this, you shut your mouth, and the illusion fell back into place with the wolf mask&#39;s snout following your movements. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve become a beast...&quot; you said, rubbing your hands along the lighter belly fur of the costume. You admired the little details you hadn&#39;t noticed before, when it was on the other guy, like the costume&#39;s nearly black treasure trail and chest fur, resembling your own body hair. You brought your arms up, revealing the costume&#39;s tufts of armpit fur, and flexed your biceps. While true that you had spent some time in the gym and made modest gains, the beast you saw in your reflection shocked you with the pure power radiating off of it, which couldn&#39;t have come from you. You kept flexing, revealing massive pecs and defined abs.<br />
<br />
You suddenly noticed your bulge in the mirror and looked down. You pulled down the shorts and jockstrap of the costume to reveal your hairy cock emerging from a sheath in the costume&#39;s crotch, which was covered in the same dark hair as your chest as if to mimic pubes. Your breathing and heart rate began speeding up as you looked at yourself in the mirror, and decided to give in to your beastly urges. You grabbed your cock with your right hand and began stroking lightly. Your faster breathing made the musky smell permeating the costume more evident, and you raised your left arm behind your head to sniff the costume&#39;s armpits, which filled your nose with a strong, pungent odor. You looked back in the mirror at the beast that you were letting yourself pretend to be, with its nose in its armpit, and its cock beginning to leak precum as it sped up its strokes. <br />
<br />
Your urge to finish overwhelmed any urge to keep the costume clean, as you let yourself cum all over the costume&#39;s belly fur and hands. You brought your hand to your face and inside the costume&#39;s mouth to lick up the cum that had landed there, savoring every drop, before pulling the jockstrap and shorts back over the costume&#39;s sheath, with your now flaccid dick sitting comfortably inside.<br />
<br />
You finally let out a big sigh, and were starting to feel the heat generated by your fun. You wanted to free yourself of the costume, just for a moment, to cool off, and reached for the zipper around the chest area. Your claws stumbled and scratched at the fabric but found no seam. &quot;I guess I tucked this thing in well,&quot; you thought. You got closer in the mirror to inspect the chest and belly and still couldn&#39;t find the seam after a more frantic search. You hold the costume&#39;s mouth open for some respite and air flow to your face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you hear a door open and close from the other side of the locker room. You curiously poked your head out and made eye contact with a muscular brown wolf wearing similar attire to what the grey wolf was wearing earlier. He was in the middle of removing his shirt when he saw you, revealing his body hair, which was similar to your costume&#39;s. &quot;Hey! What are you doing all the way over there? Get over here man! I&#39;m horny as fuck,&quot; he yelled, half playful half serious, in his deep grumbly voice. You could immediately feel the sweat forming on your skin as he said this, and pulled your head back inside the shower, now panting and with a racing heart. You heard him make his way over to you. He threw open two shower curtains, with empty showers behind you, before he pinpointed the one you were in and forced it open. <br />
<br />
He looked at the cum-stained fur on your stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you had some fun before I got here, heh.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed and started stuttering &quot;W-wait, I... uh... am not t-the guy you thin-&quot; &quot;Oh come on,&quot; he interrupted you, &quot;as if I haven&#39;t heard that excuse a million times. C&#39;mon I can smell your musk I know it&#39;s you.&quot; <br />
<br />
The last thing he said made you freeze and take a closer look at him. He licked his lips with his long canine tongue. His tail was wagging slightly behind him in excitement, or anger, or maybe both. &quot;Y-you&#39;re a real w-AAAAAHHH&quot;<br />
<br />
He interrupted you by grabbing your ankles and dragging you out of the shower and towards the lockers, with you yelling as he did. He bent down, put his arms under your legs and your upper back, then hoisted you up and dropped you onto the bench between two rows of lockers, with your ass on one end of the bench, and your arms above your head, revealing your armpits. You felt the costume&#39;s digitigrade feet touch the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know I don&#39;t get why you always make all this commotion about me transforming you. If you wanna stop, then stop fuckin&#39; accepting my $80 every week. Hell just tell me to stop now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached for your waist to take off your shorts, which he did in one smooth, strong motion, revealing your jockstrap. He hoisted your legs up with his muscular arms. Your socked feet were now by his head, your ass by his hips. He reached down with his hand to stroke your fur, bunching up and squeezing your dark chest fur as his hand ran into it, making you shudder. <br />
<br />
&quot;I starting to think you don&#39;t think you wanna stop do you? Every week it&#39;s the same. I try to transform you, you try to resist, ultimately you let me. You accept the beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled down his pants, revealing his brown sheath. He began lightly rubbing it to convince his cock to come out. He then spat on his hand and used it to lube up his cock. <br />
<br />
You began to feel the same bestial urges as when you masturbated. The urge to enjoy the wolf&#39;s body; to accept the advances of the brown wolf before you. But yet you still felt indignant; you weren&#39;t the person he had sex with every week, and he wouldn&#39;t believe you. You tried to speak up one last time:<br />
<br />
&quot;I already t-told you I&#39;m not the guy who-&quot; you gasped sharply, having been interrupted by the tip of the wolf&#39;s cock touching your asshole through a hole in the suit&#39;s ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I like to hear&quot; the wolf quipped.  &quot;Now let&#39;s make you a beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
You held your breath as the beast before you pushed his cock further into your hairy asshole. Though you tried to resist by clenching your sphincter, the wolf broke through and was able to implant himself balls-deep in your ass. The urge to resist was completely drowned out by the primal, bestial pleasure of his cock rubbing against your prostate. You felt your own cock begin to creep out of its sheath as the wolf slowly wiggled back and forth in your ass, loosening your anus. He grinned and started thrusting at a steady pace, each thrust sending a burst of electric pleasure through your body. You felt your cock begin to press more and more against your jockstrap, until it looked like it was about to snap under the tension caused by your erect member. A small stain of precum formed on the jockstrap, and you felt your changes begin as something in the mask began to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get this thing off.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf grabbed your jockstrap and pulled it slowly upwards, revealing your erect cock, all the while continuing to thrust into your ass. With a swift motion he yanked upwards and let it snap in half, throwing it aside. He repositioned himself, stopping his thrusts momentarily, as he bent down over you and put his hands on the bench beside your chest, with his chest now being inches away from yours, and then began thrusting again, this time faster. You began to let out muffled whimpers.<br />
<br />
You felt whatever was moving in the mask invade your mouth and begin making its way down your throat as he continued thrusting. You tried blocking it with your tongue, to no avail. &quot;I am a beast.&quot; The thought entered your head involuntarily, though you did not accept it. Your cock started turning red. Looking upwards was the beast&#39;s face; eyes closed, mouth agape, drool falling from his mouth to your chest fur. He was in primal, bestial, ecstasy. &quot;I am a beast&quot;. The increasingly fast thrusts from the beast sent more and more intense waves of carnal pleasure through your body. You could resist your urges no longer. &quot;I am a beast&quot;, you thought, giving into your bestial urges and allowing yourself to unify with the wolf costume. You felt your face push out suddenly and painlessly into a muzzle, as your feet expanded to fill the digitigrade feet of the suit and your spine extended into the costume&#39;s tail. You heard your whimpers and moans become less muffled as well as deeper, as the suit&#39;s muzzle became your mouth, allowing you to open it again. <br />
<br />
As you accepted the wolf costume into your body, you now accepted the other wolf. You stopped clenching your asshole and allowed his bestial cock to enter all the way inside once again. You brought your arms from laying on the bench to up around him, with your hands on his neck, as if pulling him towards you. He, realizing that you had finished transforming, began thrusting harder and harder. You felt his warm cum suddenly burst into your asshole. He continued thrusting faster and faster, still erect, seeing that you were beginning to leak cum. You let loose and allowed your cum to burst forward, painting his tan chest white. <br />
<br />
Both of you were panting with your tongues out. He was the first to move, pulling out after letting you both rest for a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;You -heh- really aren&#39;t -heh- who I thought you were, are you?&quot; he asks, between breaths.<br />
<br />
You look up at him, an expression of disbelief on your face. &quot;Oh really? -heh- What gave you -heh- that impression?&quot; you quipped sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you got a lot more into beast that my normal partner does, -heh- and you smelled very different during sex. -heh- Fuck we had a good thing going; I was -heh- paying that fucker to let me -heh- fuck him after his workouts -heh- once a week. I guess he finally tricked someone into -heh- bonding with the suit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bonding?&quot; you asked, while sitting up on the bench. He sat down next to you. You had both relaxed enough to stop panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Someone just has to say they want to wear the suit while touching it. That&#39;s enough to form a bond and allow the current wearer to take it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed. &quot;I&#39;m such an idiot.&quot; You buried your bestial face in your padded hands. &quot;So... is this, like, permanent unless I get someone else to take the suit instead of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; the brown wolf replied. &quot;Though the transformation itself only lasts 12 hours. The rest of the time you just have to be in the suit. After a while you can also take it off for brief periods. To get transformed, the wearer has to wear the suit, and accept the beast while having sex or being fucked by a specially made fuck machine. You did it surprisingly quickly honestly.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed and there was a long pause. &quot;So... now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you stay here in the zoo. They don&#39;t stop you from leaving, but if you leave with the suit and you&#39;ll probably have a hard time with society and just be arrested, and if you leave without it it&#39;ll just hunt you down and force you to wear it anyways. It&#39;s not all bad, I enjoy the beast personally, and the zoo gives us housing and food and stuff. I&#39;m just happy that I didn&#39;t get a different class of suit; some of them turn you into actual wild animals, with a fully bestial body and brain. Then you just get kept as a zoo exhibit or released into the wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof, for sure. Well, I guess whoever had my suit before had a... dorm or something here, right? Can I stay in there for now while I get adjusted to this new form?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go talk to the manager and figure something out, but first, let&#39;s shower off all this cum and sweat man.&quot;</p>
