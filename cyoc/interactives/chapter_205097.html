<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Tell me more of those first few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, so,...&quot;you tried to gesture only to realize your arms were restrained and you were bound to a cold metal slab...<br />
<br />
&quot;Pay no mind to that,&quot; your best friend said, &quot;You were explaining how you received your powers and how you learned to harness them... Your sister came from her room, appearing like your mom, I bet that was awkward, what happened next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god yeah,&quot; you chuckled. &quot;Those first few days were intense, so intense...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, between my mom, sister, and I, we managed to keep my dad from hurting anyone. Once I explained my compulsion to eat the goo, which sent me to the hospital my sister came forward and said roughly the same thing. Oh, I skipped over the part where I realized I was Brad. Woah, that was so scary, hot, and confusing man...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I bet...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after a few minutes of realizing the basics of what was going on, tasting the goo and becoming other people, we were both chastised but there was nothing we could do about it now. I was able to describe my bad experience with the doctor, and describe my getaway. After much conversing I was able to piece together the moments right after I awoke and remembered Brad... Up until this point I was just in a sexy, muscular, blond guy&#39;s body, not realizing I had &#39;encountered&#39; him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, so how did you learn to control it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was hard for me, Kenzi learned of the side effects and controlling it first. I don&#39;t have all the details but... Wait, this is really traumatic and personal stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is, but you trust me and want to share with me to get it all off your chest... you came to me, sought me out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I researched you for months... trying to find you base of operations... so I could...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk through the traumatic experiences of being rejected by your father? The strain this placed on your family? The burden of not being like your peers, or shall I say, being able to be the peer of anyone makes you the peer of none...&quot;<br />
<br />
The words slowly crept in and you felt understood for the first time in a long time, &quot;That&#39;s... That&#39;s it exactly! Like I&#39;m just 17, but I&#39;m also 48, and 27, and 62... I can be anyone with just touching them but who does that make me? I still want to be me, but at the same time, who the fuck wants to be a 17 year old?&quot; Tears began welling up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, its okay... You&#39;re safe here, you can feel your feelings and they don&#39;t have to be simple. You are countless people at once and that is allowed to be complicated... You were explaining your first, superpowered night, what happened.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, yeah that was a mess... We hadn&#39;t figured out how to change back yet.. Kenzi was stuck as mom, and I was not so unhappy to be Brad until I awoke to screaming. Some guy and a pair of identical twins were all naked in bed together and the guy and both the twins were in hysterics. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, there were strange people in your house?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled in frustration, &quot;No man, I&#39;m trying to be dramatic, give it to you from my perspective. So Kenzi woke up thinking she was mom, just like I inherently knew how to turn off the machines in the hospital. So my Dad woke up to having an extra mom and both Kenzi and my mom thought she was the original... Meanwhile I thought I woke up in a strange house where some kinky sex shit was going down and was ready to call the cops and bolt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I checked, there were no police records, from your house that night, what stopped you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you call the police like you wanted to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, the dude in the threesome ran by me and, I realized I had game but never got a threesome like him. with twins, and for the briefest second I wished I had his problems as he moved me out of the doorway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you became your father, while your sister was your Mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite, its, well its complicated. I don&#39;t think I was there, not mentally, physically, obviously but the mental part of all this is really hard for me, ya know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do understand, go on, put it in your own words, so you can make peace with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so Dad grabbed Brad pushing him aside and then they sorta merged, the women before him were both his wife and some idealized conquest... I, it, its all strange to explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You switched to speaking in third person, why are you doing that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I, I, I wanted to fuck my mom and my sister, there, are you happy? They were both, at the time 3  times my natural age... GOD DAMN... what do you want from me? Wait, what is this? I&#39;m chained, you&#39;re in my head! What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, welcome back. That&#39;s all true, but this is... What, the 5th time you&#39;ve woken up? I&#39;m very intrigued as to why you have physical powers and mine are mental. I&#39;ll find a way to figure that out, with your help of course, or perhaps you know how I can beat your personality into submission? Turn you into my eternally youthful clone to carry on my bidding? Go on, BECOME ME! It will be an interesting game of tug of war, at least!&quot; Mesmero ripped the glove off his hand and grabbed your jaw begging you to use your powers to absorb his essence, threatening to take over your body and powers to wield as a weapon for his cause...<br />
<br />
&quot;But lets talk more of this merging process, you said it was just Brad and your father present, you weren&#39;t aware of what was going on, at least not as yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Fuck, Get out of my head Mesmero!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you became this mixture of hot nurse daddy, what was that like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can remember it was only a little confusing, without my... Ahhh! Back the fuck off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think not. It was only a little confusing? What was that like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, without my family I&#39;d have just been another person, but they knew it was me and pointed out all the inconsistencies. They were able to pull me back from creating a new life for myself several times... Its been similar with all the people I absorb, though I&#39;ve been getting better. Faster at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you go into detail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, What&#39;s there to TRAP! This is a trap!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is, you&#39;re not wrong, you never were wrong and nobody meant to make you feel that way. In fact, you were completely right all along. See? Don&#39;t you feel validated? And calm?&quot;</p>
