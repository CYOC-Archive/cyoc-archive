<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica wandered into the family computer room, looking for her Phone. The room, a little small for it&#39;s purpose, was well furnished. In an alternate timeline, this might have been a youngman&#39;s bedroom, but Jeff was no longer here, instead his sister Jessica was an only child.<br />
<br />
&quot;god damn it, where the hell did I leave my phone?&quot; She said, searching the room, hoping she left it near the computer when she did her homework the previous night. as she searched however, she noticed a strange program left up on the computer&#39;s monitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah... what&#39;s this weird thing? Cron... I...vac?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica looked over the page displayed before her. The program did as best it to relay information could about it&#39;s previous user. However, since poor Jeff-the-cock had requested to be permanently, and irreversibly turned into another mans genitals, it instead showed his statistics. All the information about their neighbor Jason, from his height, to his age, to his sexuality were displayed, to the delight, and confusion of Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this thing?&quot; she said minimizing the program for the moment. She turned to the internet seeking information, and after a brief few moments, she realized the power she had.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this thing... let&#39;s me control people? no way... there&#39;s no way this can work, right? I mean...&quot; She said biting her lip in excitement. &quot;I&#39;ve had the hots for Jason for years, but I never knew he was gay... I guess it&#39;s true, all the best ones are.&quot; She said with a pout, looking over the program.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, I&#39;m taking this one back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica clicked the &#39;heterosexual&#39; tab on Jason&#39;s profile, then added one foot note. <br />
<br />
&#39;Is currently in a relationship with Jessica Henderson&#39;<br />
<br />
After setting his awareness to none, she hit submit.<br />
<br />
Jessica rushed over to her neighbors house to see if she could finally snag the guy of her dreams! She knocked on his door and heard a voice inside yell &#39;one second! I&#39;m coming!&#39;<br />
<br />
Cock could feel his owner moving suddenly. where was owner taking them? cock felt scared, and also comforted tucked away inside the boxers. It was dark, but at least it felt protected. Cock could hear muffled voices. owners and... A womans. Owner was gay, so Owner wasn&#39;t likely going to fuck yet. Cock wasn&#39;t going to cum, not for a while.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Jason stood there taking in Jessica. &quot;hey babe!&quot; he said pulling her in. &quot;Was just about to head to the gym. but I could hold off till later if you have plans?&quot; He kissed her on the lips, feeling himself stir down below.<br />
<br />
Cock started to grow a little stiff. what was happening? Owner was gay? why was cock growing now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I have a few plans...&quot; Jessica said, reaching down and stroking the once Jeff through Jason&#39;s pants. &quot;I was hoping you&#39;d let me in, so I could &#39;let you in&#39; She said with a giggle.<br />
<br />
Cock could feel a touch through the fabric, it&#39;s form growing to full mast inside it&#39;s enclosed prison. the pressure of it&#39;s confinement only making it&#39;s situation both worse and better. How was she having this effect on Owner? and, why did her voice sound so familiar?<br />
<br />
Jason led her inside, as she undid his belt. his rigid member causing a large tent in his underwear. when she set the cock free she began to stroke it. &quot;How does that feel babe? do you like it when I stroke you?&quot; she asked her boyfriend. Jason gave her a grin and said &quot;oh yes... you know just how to rev my engines Jess...&quot;<br />
<br />
Light! Cock could see. When the pants dropped the first glimmers of light could be seen, but then Owners underwear fell and a beautiful young woman was before his. she reached out and began stroking him with one hand. <br />
<br />
Cock almost came right there, but it resisted. Cock knew this was the end, if it came again, just one more time It would be only cock. but how could it escape It&#39;s death-by-orgasm?<br />
<br />
Jessica led Jason to the bedroom, and lifted her skirt, revealing her lack of panties. &quot;Come on Jason, fuck me already!&quot; She practically begged as Jason climbed on top of her, his cock at the entrance to her Vagina. Jason teased the cunt with his enlarged dick, driving her wild. &quot;you sure you can handle me babe? I don&#39;t wanna hurt you.&quot; he said worried. &quot;Just fucking do it already!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cock felt It&#39;s Owner hurry down the hall, led by the mystery woman. she was so familiar. Had owner fucked her before? no... Owner was gay before... Was he? cock&#39;s simple mind was confused. All it knew was that it wanted so desperately to cum inside her, but it knew that to do so would be it&#39;s end.<br />
<br />
When Cock reached the bedroom, it was pointed right at one of those holes for cocks. It didn&#39;t know the word, but It knew the sight... It wanted so much to be inside. It is a cock after all, isn&#39;t that where cock&#39;s belong?<br />
<br />
Cock was both scared, and excited. It was scared to lose itself entirely, but excited to finally cum inside the... the... cock place.<br />
<br />
Jason thrust inside Jessica suddenly. sending her wild with passion as his large member filled her entirely. she squeezed his cock with her pussy, riding it for all it was worth. Jason started slow, pulling out, then thrusting in, again and again. slowly then picking up speed. Once jason was sure he could fuck her without hurting her, her got to a rhythm they could enjoy.<br />
<br />
Suddenly cock was inside the cock place! the sounds were muffled, but it could tell that owner and the woman were happy. Cock, and cock place were making their owners so happy! they must be good at their jobs! suddenly cock began to slide out. NO! cock just got here! did cock not do a good job after all? why was owner removing cock?<br />
<br />
but as soon as cock was removed, it was thrust back in. and the cycle began to repeat. In, Out, In, Out. the speed picking up. Cock began to realize, it liked the In-Out more than the stay in. Owner was so smart!<br />
<br />
Cock was enjoying the sensation of the In-Out so much that it didn&#39;t notice the churning in it&#39;s balls, or the pressure at it&#39;s base. the signs of it&#39;s impending doom. Didn&#39;t notice until It felt the cum start to rise up It&#39;s shaft. &#39;Huh? No. nonono Owner Stop!&#39; Cock, Jason, and Jessica all came at once. crying out in mad passion.<br />
<br />
Jason lay next to his girlfriend, who was recovering from a mind-blowing orgasm. Jason&#39;s cock was still buried in his Hot girlfriend. A cock with no sense of self. A cock with no identity. It was never a person. It was always owners Penis, waiting for the time it would cum. waiting for pleasure. It was a good cock. And Jason was a good Owner.</p>
