<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know what, I&#39;ve seen art on the internet with taur girls and whenever I saw it I thought what it would be like to be like them, to have my body extending backwards from where my ass is and a second pair of legs back there. I want to be a humantaur and for you to be this extra part of my body.&quot; Ema said<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like fun, but if we&#39;re seen like that there&#39;s going to be trouble, and come to think of it, my disappearance could be trouble too.  Here are some reality-altering options that might help.  Which do you prefer?  You can make them forget my existence, make them think that I was always a part of you, or make them know that we were two separate people but that for some reason we ended up merging.&quot; Jeff said<br />
<br />
&quot;How about the last option?  This one looks interesting to me.&quot;  Ema said<br />
<br />
Jeff typed it all into the computer, and then asked &quot;Just one last detail.  Do you want to have a tail or not?&quot; and she said yes. So he entered the last information and confirmed. In just a blink of an eye, Jeff was no longer sitting in front of the computer, but next to it and with the impression of being standing, even though he was a little shorter than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked, come on so you can see.&quot; Ema said and went towards a mirror on her wardrobe door, which was different from before, in which I could see a full body reflection of you.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw that Ema now, looking straight ahead, was virtually unchanged, except for his eyes that were visible above the waistline of her shorts, which was where he was seeing. When she turned a little sideways Jeff could see that there was an opening in the back of her shorts, where an extension of her body came out that reached another hip with a second pair of legs. Back there Ema was wearing another pair of jean shorts, which only differed from a normal one was the opening at the back where a tail came out, similar to that of a horse and the same color as her hair. Since Jeff were just the extra part of her body, that was all he could feel, so he didn&#39;t feel anything of her body from the waist up, nor her front legs. And also he could only feel it, because Ema had control of her entire body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?  Am I sexy like this?&quot; Ema asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You look great.&quot; You said, immediately afterwards remembering that this shouldn&#39;t be possible, but at the same time wondering why you managed to speak. You felt strange the feeling of your mouth being vertical when you moved it, and Ema looked down because she also felt the movement, that you two finally realized that you could talk using her vagina as your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to do that you pervert, you being able to talk through my pussy is a real surprise.&quot; Ema said<br />
<br />
&quot;It was not my intention.  I just stated that I would be able to communicate even though I&#39;m part of you, but I didn&#39;t specify how.  It must be the way the program has chosen to make this possible.&quot; Jeff said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not bad at all.  I liked feeling my pussy move while you talk and I also didn&#39;t want to be unable to talk to you.  It&#39;s also better than I just hear your voice inside my head, I&#39;d sound crazy talking to others.&quot; Ema said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true, it&#39;s weird but better this way.&quot; Jeff said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now I want to see my new body in more detail.&quot; Ema said and started taking off her clothes. She started with the top she was wearing, and as she did so, she noticed an extra weight than usual.  Noticing that her breasts were bigger she asked Jeff what he had done and he said he had increased 2 cup sizes of them.<br />
<br />
The next piece of clothing she took off was the front shorts.  As it was a different piece from the conventional ones, since The button and zipper on the front were just decorations and she couldn&#39;t move them, she had to analyze it a little to see how to remove it, and she found some buttons in the back, on the top part of the exit for the extension of her body.  She unbuttoned and opened the bottom zipper that reinforced it, completely separating the two sides there. That done she only needed to slide the shorts down her front legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so exciting, I&#39;m still as fit as ever and looking like this the only thing out of place is your eyes on my crotch.&quot; Ema said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s weird, but I think you look sexier that way.&quot; Jeff said<br />
<br />
&quot;I also think.  And look, watching my pussy move when you talk is also very exciting, I&#39;m getting horny.&quot; Ema said, but you felt the shorts on her back get tighter, and she commented on that by asking you what that weird feeling could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s really it, but to me it looks like a dick getting hard.&quot; Jeff said<br />
<br />
&quot;A stick?  Are you saying I have a dick back there?  I didn&#39;t ask to have a dick.&quot; Ema said<br />
<br />
&quot;I also didn&#39;t mention this when I put the data in the program.  But if you think about it, it makes sense, because I became this new part of your body, but I never changed my gender.  I&#39;m a guy, that&#39;s why you have my dick between your hind legs.&quot; Jeff said<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to see this.&quot; Ema said and turned around, taking advantage of her body&#39;s mobility, reaching her back hip and pulling her shorts off.  She actually had a cock between her rear legs, and it was rock hard. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe it, I have a dick and it&#39;s really big, it&#39;s bigger than yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could only see the dick through the reflection in the mirror and recognized that it was his dick, but it was different. Not only was the cock much bigger, but the very smooth skin on the dick and ballsack, along with the lack of hair, made Jeff think of it as a femanine dick. Jeff mentioned this to his girlfriend, which made her laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let me try to see it from another angle.&quot; Ema said and stood with her back to the mirror, seeing her ass behind her tail, which she was wiggling from side to side. She also noticed the absence of a vagina there, which made her a shemale back there.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want, you can change there and get rid of our dick.&quot; Jeff said</p>
