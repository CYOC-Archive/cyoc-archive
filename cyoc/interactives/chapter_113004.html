<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You know, you’ve always been a little shit.” As Kat folded her arms against her hips, accentuating the new blue brand jeans she apparently got for her birthday. “Failing classes, whining about the success other people made in live claiming the system is rigged. It’s just that Mom can’t bear the thought of something happening to her own little kin that you’re still around.” Dan shrugged, it was no secret he had been doing worse in school but it didn’t matter that much. Since his overachieving sister Katherine had gotten approved for a scholarship it’s not like he was expected to do anything... All the family’s support would go to her anyway, he might as well take it easy.<br />
<br />
“You told Mom & Dad women we’re meant for Housework and that they should support you with financial aid instead so you can get in college…” Kat stared at him intensely, as if gauging what he was thinking. “You know I could have lived with that too, but….” She pulled out her phone showing her cellphone as the picture loaded. Dan gulped, shit! How had she? As a disapproving older sister swiped the pics from left to right, all of them had pictures of her feet… Some wearing slippers, some bare, some clad in high heels but all he had made from the creeper point of view, he furiously blushed as he tried to look away at his secret being uncovered. “Look at me when I’m talking to you!” Kat stomped her foot on the ground “It’s bad enough you’re a freak humping to me but some of these are even from Mom!”<br />
<br />
“Those… those aren’t-“ But Dan was interrupted before he could utter his excuse. “Don’t even bother, according to your history you even shared these online with your friends!” Kat was folding her hands as if gathering some power. “I’ve given it quite some thought, since you suck as my brother and part of this family, let’s give you a new purpose!” Bolts of blue lightning flickered from her hands as Dan gasped for Air. “W-what?! Are you doing, ugh!” he clenched his hands to chest as the heat erupting from the hit.   His older sister looked down at him as he fell to the floor “I decided you can be useful to mankind, well…” she smirked as her face grew with a sly grin “mostly womankind…”<br />
<br />
Dan felt the heat spreading through his body as he had difficulty moving. That crazy bitch had used a tazer of somekind? “oucw” As he felt a stab to his chest, his ribs popping and twisting as something was taken on new shapes as itchiness spread to his limbs and arms as he scraped himself on the floor. “What the h-” His skin, it was feeling like he had been in the blistering sun for hours without sun lotion, it was drying out before his eyes while greenish hue and flakes were building up on his surface. He tried to talk as he focused at gloating female above him “Graaoogh”, Dan flinched as he could no longer form words, a sharp point landed in his tongue. A quick lick and he discovered the inside of his mouth was being covered by sharp teeth as the itch spread to his gums as it flew upwards to the rest of head. His face elongating forward as he felt someone was smashing his head flat on the ground, adjusting his vision upward.<br />
<br />
He was gazing right under a satisfied looking Katherine as she was eyeing her work in progress. Dan felt a jolt of pressure as something was forcing his way at the bottom of his spine, some appendage quickly filling his pants and ripping it from behind. “Let me help you with that dear Bro….” Katherine crouched down with a pair of scissors in her hand and started to cut his pants… Dan wiggled his best trying to free himself from the grasp, yet relief washed over him as the pants finally fell off. Kat snipped her scissors in contemplation as she hummed “I think it’s best If we strip you clean, you’re of no use to me when you get strangled by your own clothes”. Dan eyes squeezed shut as the relentless changes were proceeding, his arms and legs were retracing and his hands changed into useless immovable claw tips while he could feel thin straps of skin forming between them. This had to stop, this was no tazer she really was a Witch! He looked pleadingly at Kat who cutting away his shirt from behind. The top of his arms and shoulders were growing covered in vibrant green scales, he huffed as he drew in a large breath of air as he felt his midriff and tail thicken with new muscles in bulk he never had before.<br />
<br />
She tapped her foot under stomach and rolled him on his back. A white soft underbelly greeted him as the light reflected of his scales, the pattern reached all the way down to his… his… tail? He was shocked as he had recognized the outline of the pattern and color. He was a crocodile?!  This didn’t make any sense…  Dan murmled to himself, I mean I know witches don’t make any sense in the first place. But why a crocodile? Certainly there were more demeaning animals he could be turned into, like a pig or a rabbit, perhaps even a bug… Crocs were kinda cool right…?<br />
<br />
He gasped as he felt a warm hand rubbing on his loins. Kat had reached his underwear… She wouldn’t really…  The warmth in his body subsided as he felt limbs and body settling in. *snip *snip. Two cotton folds of what had been his underwear felt to his sides as he gazed upon the only thing still human his developing cock and ballsack stood proudly in the dessert of white croc scales. “Awww, what a cutie!” Kat had crouched down as she poked her finger into his junk. What! He felt his cock jump out in reaction to the touch. It wasn’t cute!!  She slowly twirled her finger on the outside, Dan felt a stirring in his groin as he blushed bright red. His wiener he been slowly growing in the palm of her hand. “This the problem unfortunately, there is something human left here that is holding back the full transformation.” She smirked as she tweezed a little pubic hair out his sack, which was reward with a little flinch and annoyed look of her little brother. He could feel a gentle hand patting his ballsack “I have to get rid of the little Danny Jr’s first so you can fully become a good little croc.” Flinching he accrued the thought of what that could mean, get rid of…. How? He still couldn’t move as Kat stood up as she towered over him. “Well there is no way, I’m giving you a handjob, but since you like feet so much and seeing your future with them I suppose I’ll grant you one favor!”<br />
<br />
What do you?! “Ooofff” he let out a large gasp of air as her foot descended on his cock. Crushing and grinding his balls into his body. “Come on, I don’t have all day just except your fate.” Her sole twisted into his soft flesh and his balls were grinded around between his new scale skin belly and Katherine’s iron heel, his- his fate? Little clots of fallen of dirt covered his scrotum as drops of pre-cum started to flow down from his manhood, creating a sticky dark mess covering her shoe. “Awww you totally ruined them!” Kat uttered annoyed as she increased her trust “And I just got them for my birthday, this is why we can’t have nice things!” Dan’s breathing increased rapidly, what was going on, it definitely hurt but somehow his penis only grew harder under her relentless stomping guidance.<br />
<br />
Kat stared down at her little brother, she knew he had been a little perv. She had to release him anyway for the full transformation spell to work and since it was his last day as a human she thought she might as well make it a nice farewell. She shrugged as she stomped her foot down for a final time. She could feel a small shake and bob under heel as she saw the strands of cum coating her foot, it was rather quickly done. Had she known he would ruin her shoes however….. no matter, soon she would have a new pair…..”<br />
<br />
Dan felt the final stomp coming down on his manhood as his cock glady seem to betray him, spewing what his sis had called “Danny Jr’s” around her foot. Thick globs of cum had covered her shoe but also wads had been grinded into his stomach. “Ugn!” He felt a warm cramp in his cock as it painfully twisted around, his human skin slowly disappeared as his cock become brighter more pink and slimy as it descended into a new pouch at the base. The teen balls he had been so proud off retracted in his body leaving not a trace of his manhood except blank crocodile skin with a tiny opening. Suddenly a hand appeared giving a few satisfied taps on his belly “There, there” Katherine smiled “Everything is over now… well when it comes to the transformation…. You make a beautiful croc don’t you as she held up a mirror. Dan saw what happened as he could move again, he was croc, a vibrant green croc with a total length of roughly 2 meters, not that big but definitely a crocodile. <br />
<br />
He was furious as he flinched out to Kat’s leg.  She didn’t even try to avoid it! She laughed as her brothers futile attempts to bite through her jeans. “Sorry Bro, but in contradiction to you, I am smart enough to get into college by myself, I specially twisted the strength of your jaw muscles to be that of a baby crocodile!” she continued to snicker, when she gazed upon the dread in Dan’s visage her face turned serious. “Now pay attention for the real purpose of your new existence. “ she twisted her hand in odds shapes a blue circle appeared under them and the world around them blurred as they were teleported away.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The blue smokes disappeared as Dan looked around him confused. They were no longer inside their parents’ house…. Where were they? A strange scent was heaving around in the air, the smell of livestock and chemicals. Behind him were several enclosures, cages and pools filled with turtles, crocodiles, alligators and something that appeared to be snakes. The walls were stacked full with shelves with all kinds of oils, paints, pigments and creams. To the east there were several large tanning racks some in use, bolsting impressive hides to dry in the sun, while some look like they were just being cleaned. To the west he saw a large glass closet loaded with female fashion accessories. Woman’s Purses, Woman’s shoes, Woman’s wallets, Woman’s belts and far more. He recognized this place, he had been on a school trip here it wasn’t that far from town… but… but this a Croc Farm!<br />
<br />
“Yes, that is the fate best fit. You’re going to become fashion accessories for woman around the world, theirs heels, their purses and wallets…. Well mostly the woman here in town” Kat snickered as she saw her little brother’s worried face, his eyes opening in wide fear as he didn’t know what to do. <br />
<br />
 “Don’t worry, you’re not ready yet” as she gloated with pleasure “I have arranged with the workers here you are to be top product brand as a special commission. You’ll spend a few good weeks plumping up so you can really stretch that skin of yours to max.” as she demonstratively pinched his belly “you’ll be massaged and coated with oils and creams daily to deliver top quality skin, and since this is close by we will come to visit you!” We? Dan thought in panic as he watched Katherine so casually explaining her plan, Kat nodded in understanding “Yes, I, our mother, our aunt and your ex-girlfriend and perhaps even grandmother if she has the time.” She continued “I promised all of them a very special gift they’ll come visit and decide what they want from me!.... uh well you… what they want from you!” His older sister seemed very pleased as she gently rubbed his back “Wouldn’t it be nice to have your ex-girlfriend carry a nice feminine wallet of croc skin as a permanent souvenir? Or be used for Aunti’s working shoe?” <br />
<br />
Dan hissed in protest. “Hush, hush you brought this upon yourself, I know I’ll be delighted at the very least” Katherine whispered into his ear.</p>
