<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three gyaru girls knew they were going to be popular online after they converted. They just didn&#39;t expect how fast it would be. Almost as soon as they made their presence known, they started getting tons of followers, most of them from Japan. By the next day, Animalia&#39;s PR-MD was contacting the Quasi-Raccoon Cuties, as their group was now known, about doing a webseries. The girls quickly agreed to that, though at the moment, they weren&#39;t sure about what their show would be about. Maybe it would be about trending fashions, highlights on Japanese culture, or doing reviews on new movies, shows, and video games. It was undecided at the moment, but the trio were all excited for it.<br />
<br />
Of course, before they could really get started, there are still a few things they had to do first. Like all new Animalians, they have to a few remedial classes on how to handle their new diets, furs, instincts, etc. It shouldn&#39;t be so hard for Tani as there have already been some red panda Animalians established. Naya would be more of a challenge as ringtails are a more obscure animal and there haven&#39;t been any Animalians of that species before her. But the one who would have to go through most would be Date. Date didn&#39;t want to become just a simple raccoon dog. In Japanese mythology, raccoon dogs are known as tanuki and are known for many things, including have large testicles. As such, Date decided to become a hermaphrodite tanuki. It was a big adjustment, but she made it for reasons beyond her choice of Animalian.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
As far as Date could remember, she had never been certain about who she was. Even when she was a little girl, there had been days where she thought boys were gross and didn&#39;t want anything to do with them. And yet, there were also days where she wanted to be with them and play. It was even worse when she was in high school, where the differences between boys and girls become even more obvious. And it wasn&#39;t just her gender identity that was in flux. Date had a tendency to bounce between different cliques and subcultures. She had been preppy, gothic, rougher, domestic, bookish, athletic. It was hard for her to really stick to one role. In hindsight, it might have been an early indicator for her eventual transformation. Tanuki are known to be shapeshifters, taking on different forms to set up pranks.<br />
<br />
Date thought she had found something to stick with when did the gyaru role with Tani and Naya. She certainly felt a strong connection to the other girls. And for the most part, pretending to be white felt right. Though she had times where she thought like a boy. The tanning sessions helped her keep her mind off of it. That is until they went too far and got melanoma. At least Animalia gave them a way out of it and new sexy bodies for it. But for Date, it was more than that. She felt like she could really be who she was meant to be.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you&#39;ve thought this through,&quot; said Judy as she got the syringe ready, &quot;This isn&#39;t something that can be undone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that how it is with all conversions?&quot; asked Date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but this is more than that,&quot; said Judy, &quot;One shouldn&#39;t change one&#39;s sex on a whim. That is a lifelong commitment. Something that should only be taken by someone who is certain about what they really are inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was part of the problem. Date was never completely certain whether she felt more like a girl or a boy inside. But being a herm meant she could be both. Perhaps that would cement things for her. &quot;I am certain,&quot; she said, half-truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; said Judy before administering the shot, &quot;Welcome to Animalia.&quot; She then left the room to give Date privacy.<br />
<br />
Date almost immediately started feeling warm. She started taking off her clothes until she was left in her underwear. The sight of her overtanned skin did make her cringe a bit. But her skin was already feeling better. The general sunburn-like ache was fading as Date noticed hairs were appearing. The hairs quickly thickened into brown fur. She felt a tingle in her ears as they started moving up her head and became pointed. She soon felt her tailbone extending out of her back as it grew fur. Though despite resembling a raccoon in several ways, the fur on the tail did not have any stripes.<br />
<br />
Then Date felt more flushed as she felt a surge of heat in her groin. She panted as she pulled down her panties, her teeth getting sharper and her tongue longer. Her pussy was being pushed backwards as the area it was in started bulging out. She rubbed the growing scrotum, feeling surprisingly aroused by this. Her arousal increased when her testicles formed and started growing. Then soon grew to a considerable size, filling her palm nicely.<br />
<br />
Just like her new balls were swelling, so were Date&#39;s breasts. As much as Date loved being a gyaru, she had always felt a little inferior for not having breasts as big as Caucasian girls. That was no longer an issue as her boobs were quickly growing too large for her bra. Date snapped her bra off before fondling herself. She knew all Animalian women were naturally well-endowed and it looked like she would be getting a particularly big rack.<br />
<br />
Just when she thought she couldn&#39;t get more aroused, a particular pleasurable feeling occurred in front of her scrotum. Flesh built up to form a sheath before her skin opened and something pushed out. Date moaned as a canine cock emerged, officially making hir a herm. Shi grasped hir new cock as it grew in hir hand. Shi started stroking it, careful not to scratch hirself with hir new claws. Date made whining sounds as hir face finished pushing out into a muzzle. Hir earlier arousal made hir hit hir peak quickly. With a yip, hir cock erupted, firing out a lot of seed. Quite clearly, hir new balls weren&#39;t filled with hot air.<br />
<br />
Date licked her lips as shi finished hir climax. Shi slowly stood up and went to the mirror. The tanuki herm looking back was definitely very sex. Not only did shi have an impressive set of balls and cock, but shi also had a plump ass and E-cup breasts. Shi was most definitely a figure of fertility. Compared to the pictures of raccoon and badger Animalians shi had seen, Date could see a resemblance to them, but shi was clearly a breed apart from them, despite the black mask of fur over hir eyes.<br />
<br />
Date looked over hirself with a big smile. &quot;All I need now is a hat, a bottle of sake, a promissory note, and a big belly,&quot; shi said to hirself. Shi rubbed hir belly, feeling the stronger abs shi had now. &quot;Well, not too big a belly,&quot; shi added, &quot;Probably just enough to look padded.&quot; As much as shi&#39;d like to fit the traditional look of a tanuki, shi didn&#39;t want to ruin hir figure. But then, shi wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were diets online to help women get that cute, plump look. And while Date was no longer all woman, shi was definitely sure shi could pull off the plump look.</p>
