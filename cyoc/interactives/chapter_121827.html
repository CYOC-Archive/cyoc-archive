<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan picked up a pair of brown leather flip-flops. They looked comfortable, but much too big.<br />
<br />
Ryan slid one foot into the first sandal. Even though they dwarfed his feet, he enjoyed the feeling of them, soft and slightly warm. Quite warm actually, he thought, scrunching his toes. He kicked off his second shoe and slid on the other sandal. He felt silly wearing the much-too-large footwear, but also enjoying how good they felt. <br />
<br />
The soles was really warming up though. As he looked down, he saw that his feet were starting to sweat. Gross, he thought, embarrassed that he was getting these new shoes sweaty. He tried to kick one of the sandals off, but his toes seemed to have tightened around the front, and he couldn’t get it off. They flopped around as he shook his leg. He knelt, using his hands to try to slide them off, but as he stared at his feet, something looked wrong. They seemed bigger.<br />
<br />
Ryan started to feel his toes pushing out, making the strap of the flip-flops dig deeper. What was going on? His feet were a size larger than they should be, and he could actually feel them sliding backwards against the leather. They were growing right in front of him! He was shocked, but couldn’t help but enjoy the feeling of his sweaty feet against the leather as they stretched out. They weren’t just getting longer, but more muscular as well, the tops of his feet thickening. Wow, they were nearly the size of the flip-flops now! Whatever was happening, he liked his new big feet, and went along with the strange circumstances. He wiggled his toes as they grey longer.<br />
<br />
The pleasure gave way to concern as he continued to gaze at his feet: he could feel them getting hotter and sweatier, but he wasn’t prepared for them to darken, getting more tan as if he spent hours outside. He was long past believing this was a trick of the light, and he was worried that the changes were going too far. He squirmed, but that just seemed to make his feet grow bigger, widening, toes splaying out. His feet were long and wide, and he could feel their increased weight as he lifted his leg, trying in vain to remove a sandal. The sandals fit perfectly now, but they wouldn’t come off.<br />
<br />
As he grabbed them with his hands, the warmth spread to them as well. Gasping, Ryan stood up again, feeling his hands heat up. He knew what would happen now. His fingers began to lengthen, his knuckles cracking as they spread out and his palms grew much wider. His nails looked broader and thicker than ever. Catching himself in the mirror, he laughed nervously, seeing his giant hands and feet. His whole body broke out in a sweat.<br />
<br />
His arms and legs heated up next, and Ryan felt them stretching as he shot up inch after inch, his shirt straining as his shoulders broadened. His waistband suddenly felt way too tight, and it took Ryan a moment to control his newly massive hands enough to undo his fly. When he did, he breathed a sigh of relief, feeling his thickening muscular torso fill out his now open trouser waist. Toned muscles took shape in his abdomen and arms, and he felt warmth streak down his pelvis as muscles bulged and sharpened, creating a V that disappeared below his open waistband. His torso lengthened still further, brining him up past 6 feet, by two, then four inches.<br />
<br />
His shirt sleeves tightened and started to tear as his shoulders expanded outward. He lifted his arms trying to wrestle his shirt off before it got destroyed. As he lifted his arms, he caught a whiff of his sweaty armpits, but he could smell something else too: was it chlorine? Then his back muscles bulged again, and his shirt ripped apart, falling away from his torso. <br />
<br />
That wasn’t the only thing disappearing though. Ryan’s chest, scattered with a dusting of hair, began to itch, and he reached his oversized hands to brush them over his pecs as they swelled and widened. As his fingers bushed his chest hair, it began to fall away, as if he were dusting it off. Feeling his thick fingers touch his skin and brush against his nipples began to turn him on, and even though his chest hair (which until now he’d been proud of) was falling out, he couldn’t help continuing to touch himself. Soon his chest was completely smooth, and looking down he could see his tan flowing across his whole body, his nipples darkening as they stretched larger. His pecs now looked like thick, flat slabs. He flexed them, raising his arms and flexing his biceps too, feeling a searing pleasure as his muscles expanded with each movement. He felt a tingle in his armpits, and looking, realized his pit hair was disappearing too. His previously moderately hairy body was now smooth everywhere he could see.<br />
<br />
Was he going to lose his body hair everywhere? Ryan could feel his cock swelling in his pants: his crotch was feeling much too tight. He scrabbled at his fly, noticing as he did so that the chlorine smell was getting stronger. Unzipping, he could feel his cock straining at his underwear, tenting the fabric, but when he reached to grab it he was surprised to feel, not his boxers, but a smooth, stretchy surface instead. His cock was filling up the front of a speedo! He could see the stars and stripes printed on the slick surface distorting as his cock hardened. Ryan had always had a good-sized cock at 7 inches, and it wasn’t lengthening now so much as thickening, swelling to the size of an aluminum can as he ran his large fingers up and down the taught speedo’s surface. <br />
<br />
He could feel his balls tightening up, getting closer to releasing, and then the changes started happening much faster. His abs flexed and clenched as he began to precum. They formed an increasingly pronounced 8 pack as he felt a damp spot spreading where the tip of his cock was still contained inside his new speedo. The fabric stretched even tighter as his ass filled out, becoming more muscular. He began panting as he rubbed his cock harder, and then felt his face changing, his jaw widening and neck thickening, his ears growing and sticking out, his nose enlarging. He could feel his teeth shifting, and while he couldn’t see it, the hair on his head, the only place left with hair on his body, was changing from sandy to sun-bleached blond. <br />
<br />
The pressure built in his balls, and he knew he couldn&#39;t last much longer. Looking down, he saw his massive feet below his thickening cock, and that sent him over he edge. He yelled and came, his voice dropping as he shot thick cum inside the speedo, soaking the front as wave after wave of pleasure washed over him. His toes flexed as his feet and hands had one last spurt of growth. With each load of cum, his memories of his old life disappeared, replaced by years of training and swimming competitions and travel. He knew the chlorine smell was permanent from most of his life spent in pools. No more school memories: it was all about the pool. <br />
<br />
Ryan was left in nothing but his cum-soaked speedo and his leather flipflops. He kicked one of them off easily, seeing the sweaty imprint of his foot on the leather from years of wearing them. He felt like he hadn’t been able to get them off for some reason, but all that was fading. He knew he needed to get back to swimming, although he was glad he’d taken a break to beat one off so he could concentrate again. He threw on his pants and slipped his flip-flops back on, ready to head out to the pool.</p>
