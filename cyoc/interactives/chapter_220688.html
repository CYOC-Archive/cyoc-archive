<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Are you certain you want to retire here,” Lilith looking at her husband as she lay in bed; her husband Lucifer Morningstar currently deposed Devil of hell.<br />
“It would be a nice way to end things,” Lucifer staring out as the setting sun lets loose its last rays before night claims the sky. “But there is still much to do,” Lucifer putting down his tumbler as he finished the last of his whiskey; “give me an hour to sort out my thoughts my love. I’ll join you then,” Lucifer giving his demon wife a loving kiss before he leaves the bed chamber. Heading to an adjoining room, he sits down at a large mahogany desk. He takes a moment to soak in the décor. The white alabaster walls with frescoes of nature decorating the room, Lucifer sighs as he opens the desk to take out a stack of papers along with an ink well and quill. He begins writing.<br />
<br />
‘Dear Enoch,<br />
If you are reading this, then I am truly dead. I know we always had differences of opinion when it came to your future; but I want you to know that I am proud of you. You fought all your life to be where you are. You never let yourself become defeated, despite the obstacles placed before you.<br />
<br />
When you left after the siege of Dis; horrified at what you saw and what you were made to do, I knew then that you would never accept being the next devil; you would never rule hell. You put me in a difficult spot as the senate was demanding I make you heir apparent. But I knew you would not bend. You had an iron will, and I swelled with pride when you chose to strike out on your own. Venturing up to earth to once again visit the mortal realm and see humanity through fresh eyes. You are the reason why I am glad to be known as the creator of free will. Never forget that.<br />
<br />
So consider this my last will and testament. I Lucifer Morningstar, creator of free will; being of sound mind and body, bequeath to you all my heavenly possessions and properties that I still currently possess, that are being held in trust by Jehovah. This also includes any titles I once had when I was an angel. May it serve you well on the next stage of your immortal life. I hope you find your true love like I did when I was your age.’<br />
<br />
Lucifer took a moment to read the letter. Making sure he covered all of his bases before he sealed it up in an enveloped and wrote instructions to be handed to his son upon his demise. He was about to Put down the quill, when he suddenly found the need to write more letters. One to each of his children; taking time to keep them personal and as well to assure that their titles and stations in hell are to remain as they are. Pausing, he also wrote down that they all need to stick together and help each other out, and more importantly to help out their baby sister Miasma who is slated to be the next devil after him. Satisfied he sealed up each letter and also had specific instructions to be given out in case of his death.<br />
<br />
“It’s done,” Lucifer speaking; “you’ll make sure they get to where they need to go?”<br />
“Yes,” Jehovah nodding as he entered the room in his usual way; “but remember, this is only in case you die. There is no guarantee of it happening.”<br />
“It will be guaranteed if I go back down to hell,” Lucifer staring at the pile of letters before him; “I can’t sit here and do nothing.”<br />
“Just like your son,” Jehovah chuckling as he picks up the letters; “he already made waves with the temple priests with his sass, saved Tarfiel and befriended a cherub.”<br />
“He always like to hit the ground running,” Lucifer smiling; “look after him.”<br />
“Don’t worry,” Jehovah opening up a portal to head back to the heavenly palace; “But don’t be surprised if you survive this and find out he is looking after us.”<br />
<br />
Lucifer couldn’t help but smile as Jehovah left.<br />
‘Enoch certainly has matured since that incident with Dionysus,’ Lucifer think as he gets up from the desk; ‘who would have thought that five hundred years working with kobolds would smarten him up.’<br />
 As Lucifer walked along the marble floor; his cloven hooves making an audible clopping sound, he shakes his head as he spares on final look of his old study. Sighing as he ponders if this will be the last time he ever steps in these rooms again. He takes a breath and steels his nerves for what must be done; nodding at decision, he heads back to the bedchamber where his wife waits him.<br />
<br />
********************************************************<br />
<br />
Just off of a street in Paris called Rue Laforest sat Maisy, Rachael and Rebeca in Parthenope&#39;s safe house in an apartment complex that sits within Parc Larouse. From where they were, they were south of the Eiffel tower which they could see. The Arc De Triomphe was father north but obscured do to the buildings in the way. Normally, Rachael would want to take this time to explore the city, but Parthenope made clear they were to stay hidden for the moment. Despite not speaking a single word of French in her life, Rachael found herself able understand the French program airing on the television within the small living room. Sitting with her mother who was currently sleeping; she cried for hours upon feeling the death of Astaroth; Parthenope had to use a spell to put Rebeca to sleep as she was acting irrational.<br />
<br />
Maisy, who wanted to go out the most, had to confine herself to the balcony outside for the time being. She was in a human disguise that was slightly different from her Maisy Morgenstern look that she had while in college with Rachael. With hers, Rachael’s and Rebeca’s deaths faked when they came to hell to become demons, it was necessary to assume a new disguise. Maisy having experience with shifting to a human form, she was able to achieve this. Rachael wasn’t so experienced. She was able to shift into a human form, but it was exactly what she looked like before she became a demon. The only difference is the blue sapphire ear and nose studs and gorgon tattoo she was now sporting. The tattoo naturally kept still; but Maisy looked on stunned when Rachael managed to open a portal back to their residence to pluck some clothing. Clothing that was going to be destroyed; Parthonope was not thrilled with what Rachael accomplished, but she soon realised that If Rachael was to venture outside, she would need clothing that fit her. She may now be a demon that revels in her nudity; but on Earth, she had to be dressed to fit in. Only Rebbeca was still in her demon form as she slept.<br />
<br />
“Would you like some tea,” Parthonope breaking the silence as she watched Rachael stare into a sullen abyss that was television.<br />
“Thank you, tea would be nice,” Rachael sighing; as she turned off the television.<br />
“Perhaps you should practice some more,” the disguised angel speaking as she was in the small kitchen; “those portals of yours are looking good. But they could be better.”<br />
“This coming from the angel that got grumpy when I need clothes after shifting and was naked as a result,” Rachael picking up the book Enoch left her, Idiots guide to portal summoning.<br />
“You should have let me head back first to make sure the area was secured before hoping through to nick some garments as you said,” Parthenope stating; “but I do understand the need to feel dressed for the situation.”<br />
“I only hope my clothes will fit my mother here,” Rachael looking at the sleeping red scaled demon with a green dyed pixie haircut and jade jewellery; “she will need to wear something if we are to step outside.”<br />
“I may have a few things that would fit your mother,” Parthenope adding as she rummages in the kitchen for the tea ingredients; “in case the clothes you got are too small for her.”<br />
<br />
Parthenope nodded as she returned with a tray of empty cups with cream and sugar; the sound of a kettle singing on the stove sounding nearby.<br />
“I also have to compliment you on your French,” the angel speaking; “it is very fluent for someone who spent their life in America speaking only in American.”<br />
“I’m speaking French,” Rachael absently opening a small portal and plucking more bags of chips and various snacks from a soon to be depleted vending machine at a community college she one attended. “I didn’t even realize it,” Rachael commenting; “Maisy said something about all demons able to understand human languages, I just didn’t think it would be so quick.”<br />
“Or maybe,” Parthenope returning with a tea pot full of hot water and tea bags; “it’s something more. Maybe it’s the bond you have with Maisy that is allowing you to be such a quick study with your abilities. You said yourself before we met,” Parthenope pouring the tea,” that you took to flying with your wings like a fish takes to water.”<br />
“And I am getting skilled with these portals,” Rachael nodding as she accepts the cup of tea; “I wonder if there is more I have yet to discover now that I am immortal.”<br />
“We take it one day at a time,” Parthenope sipping her cup; “tonight we get some rest and then starting tomorrow we search for Leviathan Morningstar. I may have an idea where he is hiding,” Parthenope putting her tea down; “and while we are here on Earth, it’s best to call me Joan. It was my human name.”</p>
