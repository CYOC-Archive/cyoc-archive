<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day had been both nerve racking and even boring for Jenny, and had essentially killed all the plans for the day that she and Harry had. She had hopes to meet Harry&#39;s brother, maybe see what his were form looked like, meet with the minister to discuss the wedding plans, and maybe meet with Akane&#39;s daughter-in-law, Keiko, to discuss the flower arrangements for the wedding. But those plans had all been foiled, and foiled by the thing she probably feared the most, a negative response from her family in Alabama. She had to let them know she was getting married and had found true love with Harry, and did her best to hold onto the hope that her parents would see that she had her OWN life to lead. She mentally kept running her mantra that Francis had given her to use to keep preparing for when she would have to stand up to her parents directly, and to demonstrate that point to them.<br />
<br />
But it was clear that her parents or Dieter had sent someone to do something to interfere with her wedding. She personally figured it would be Dieter, as her father despite a lot of his talk wasn&#39;t the type condone out right murder or kidnapping to get his way. Regardless of who sent the agent, it was enough to cancel the plans she and Harry had for the day. She wasn&#39;t ungrateful that the Skulk was looking after her and had brought her to Akane&#39;s home where she could be better protected from this agent, she just wished her problems weren&#39;t growing and making such actions necessary. It felt like her past didn&#39;t want her to be happy.<br />
<br />
That left her fidgeting or pacing in the living room of Akane Tachibana&#39;s home. It was a lovely home, clearly larger than the Jenkins home or her own family&#39;s home back in Alabama. In many ways it seemed to mix many aspects of the long life that Akane Tachibana had lead. There were several amenities that were fairly typical of a modern American household while the architecture and other amenities were far closer to traditional Japanese architecture and style. It made for an interesting contrast, but Jenny couldn&#39;t really focus on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, dear,&quot; Lisa Jenkins said to her from a couch where they had been watching television, mostly just to pass the time, &quot;None of us wanted what has happened to happen... but there really isn&#39;t that much more that can be done. We&#39;ll have to let the Skulk and the police handle the matter. I&#39;m sure things will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her husband, Henry Jenkins nodded beside her. He and his wife liked Jenny. She seemed smart and fun, and even quite cheerful when things like this weren&#39;t popping up, and to them, that made Jenny the perfect match for Harry regardless of whether or not they had become weres.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... what if it&#39;s not?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;what if this guy really is dangerous?&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried to pace again when she felt two arms wrap around her and hold her in a firm hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;m sure the police and the Skulk&#39;s security people can handle him?&quot; Harry said to her, &quot;shoot, he probably only JUST escaped the college last night. No one&#39;s going to let anyone hurt you, Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny felt a bit better at getting the hug and felt herself easily fall back into Harry&#39;s arms. It didn&#39;t erase all her fears and worries, but it did make her feel a bit better. She eventually managed to place her hands over Harry&#39;s to keep his grip on her tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... our day... our plans... meeting your brother...&quot; Jenny said weakly, &quot;All ruined.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not ruined,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;postponed. We can pick things up tomorrow, or perhaps Dr. and Mrs. Tachibana would discuss the floral arrangements over dinner... provided that this agent is caught.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded and kept her grip on Harry&#39;s hands. Having him close to her, regardless of being in human or fox form, made her feel good. It gave her the confidence to stand firm and remember her mantra. She only hoped that that would be enough to restore her hope in a good future. She was about say something when she heard a door slide open, which made her and Harry turn toward it. They found Akane standing quietly in the doorway that lead to a hallway that lead into a different portion of her home. She looked a bit pained by something, but Jenny also saw something that looked she was relieved as well.<br />
<br />
Having overheard the end of Harry and Jenny&#39;s conversation, Akane choose provide what assurance she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is good news in that regard,&quot; Akane spoke in a fairly calm voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was caught?&quot; Lisa asked, sounding hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was caught shortly after you were brought here,&quot; Akane spoke calmly, &quot;though given some circumstances, we wanted to make sure that this agent had no help from inside Moon Lake... which was supposed to be determined by the police investigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane&#39;s voice fell off at the end, which those present picked up on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, Mrs. Tachibana?&quot; Harry asked, still holding onto Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing that time will not heal,&quot; Akane answered with a sigh, &quot;apparently the agent made a ruckus at the police station and was killed in his escape attempt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Henry said simply. Akane didn&#39;t answer him initially and Jenny actually noticed her frown slightly. Akane still had a look of dignity about her, but Jenny could see the frown and guessed that it had more to do than the loss of knowledge about what the agent knew before he was killed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t hurt someone, did he?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He managed to wound my grandson, Daisuke, before he was taken down,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;but he will be fine, and that is a relief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Jenny said to the Skulk leader.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not your fault,&quot; Akane gave her a soft smile, trying to hide some of her worry for her grandson, &quot;never think that it is. My grandsons have worked as my retainers and security personnel for years. Something like this is probably bound to have happened regardless of the specifics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will thank him for us, won&#39;t you?&quot; Harry asked, &quot;for all the efforts you and the Skulk have made for our safety?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; Akane replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they find out if he had help?&quot; Lisa asked. She might be a Normal, but ever since the Jenkins family had moved to Moon Lake, she&#39;d felt the town to be rather close knit and friendly. She found it hard to believe that anyone in Moon Lake would betray their neighbors in such a way, or at least not deliberately.<br />
<br />
&quot;It took some work with the suspect&#39;s phone,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;but, yes. We can be quite confident that no one inside Moon Lake was helping him. Which would mean that things should be safe for you now... and I apologize we were not better prepared for this agent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny had some relief at that, in that what Harry and his parents had said about their plans for the day being postponed might be even more relevant. They might not get to talk to the minister today, but perhaps they could visit Keiko to discuss the flower arrangements or let Harry introduce her to his brother. If he was willing, Jenny hoped he would transform, just to satisfy her curiosity as to what kind of breed of dog he transformed into.<br />
<br />
&quot;It all worked out in a way,&quot; Harry spoke, &quot;I wish your grandson didn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to get hurt in all this and hope he recovers, but I&#39;d suppose it did work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Akane nodded, &quot;to allow for praise for some small miracles.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others all nodded at that. Some things may not have gone as planned, but things could have been worse. All things considered, they could have been far worse.</p>
