<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty walked downstairs. At first he wanted to give his foster parents a chance to redeem themselves after Dustin wasn´t there anymore. But while he changed Dustin he decided against it. Part of Dustin&#39;s behavior was their fault, so until he changed their behavior himself they weren´t better than Dustin. In fact if he should have mercy with one of them it would be Dustin himself, as he could change his behavior towards Ty easier himself. So his foster parents earned a fate similar to what he had done to Dustin. With his powers nobody would question that he lived alone after all.<br />
So he only needed to decide what they should resemble. Dustin was now some kind of warrior, even without real armor. May by he should change the “clothes” Dustin wears into something more fitting later. He decided to choose that while he changed his soon former foster parents, so he continued to look for them. As he didn´t find them anywhere in the house Ty grabbed something to eat before returning to his room, sitting at his desk in front of Dustin eating.<br />
To Dustin that was surreal. Changed into a small action figure by his foster brother and now watching him eat. Ty looked at him. “Do you want a bit Dustin? Ah I forgot, you don´t eat or drink anything anymore in that form.” Ty said mockingly before laughing, as his snack was a favorite of Dustin. “Ty, that isn´t funny. Stop mocking me, its degrading enough to be something lifeless like your toy.” Dustin thought a bit angry, but mostly hopeless. As if Ty could hear him.<br />
When Ty was finished eating he decided to do the same thing as with Dustin before, just let his foster parents appear here in his room. A small wish later both Mark and June stood frozen in front of him, looking confused. That quickly changed to an annoyed look when they saw Ty. “What have you done now, boy?” asked Mark angry. Ty smiled at them. “I just summoned you here to share the fate of your son.” “I have no son, and I would never call you one.” Mark replied loud. Dustin was shocked by this. How could they not remember him? But Ty answered that seconds later: “Oh sorry, I forgot I let everyone forget about Dustin here being ever human. Meet your son then as I wish for you two to remember him again.” He lifted Dustin up to show them, and they both looked shocked at the toy in his hands.<br />
As they were both speechless in their shock, Ty started their changes. First vanishing their clothes beside their underwear, which then merged to their skin, pushing Mark&#39;s cock away behind a grey wall of cloth while Junes red panties only hid her pussy from sight. As Ty worked quicker on them their skin started to look like clothes seconds later.<br />
Mark&#39;s feet changed into brown walking shoes with black shoelaces, short dark-green socks came out of them. Above then he wore light-green pants, ending in a black belt above a button which was connected to his squished cock. His torso resembled a light-grey shirt with long arms. In front of the Shirt stood his name, “Mark”, in bright green letters, while on his back appeared “TY´S TOY” with “No.02” below that. The skin on his hands soon resembled dark-green, finger-less gloves. His hair grew longer, but turned upwards and turned into a dark-green pointed hat with a light blue band around it. Under the hat you could see short brown hair standing out, as Ty didn´t wanted him bald.<br />
At the same time Junes skin changed as well. Her feet changed into dark-blue sneakers with a bit lighter blue shoelaces, ending in grey socks. From the outside the skin above her knees bloated away, forming a light-blue skirt, which grew a bit down over her knees, but you could still see her legs underneath. Above the skirt formed a small brown band, resembling a belt. Then a grey blouse formed, which sleeves reaching down to her hands, that were covered in dark-blue gloves. On the front of the blouse formed in bright blue letters her name, separated in the middle by the open front, “JU – NE”, and on her back stood “TY´S TOY” with “No.03” below it. Her hair also grew upwards into a pointed hat, turning also dark-blue with a light-green band around it. Another layer of hair was seen under it, growing down to her neck.<br />
They both were still to shocked to say anything, so Ty left them in the room while he searched for the finishing touches. Mark would need a staff to resemble a wizard, while June would need a broom to resemble some cliche witch. As he thought about it, their objects didn´t need much value for them, so he quickly took the kitchen broom for June and a golf club for Mark.<br />
When he returned to his room both Mark and June were trying to do anything, but still frozen couldn´t. Ty opened Marks fingers of his left hand before pressing his golf club in, closing the fingers around the middle of the club. He did the same with the broom for June&#39;s right hand. “Ty, please stop this, whatever it is.” June said. Ty grinned at her. “Why should I stop? You don´t like me and treated me that way. When I´m finished with you I can live a happy life and have fun with my new toys. Now I wish for that broom to look like a good witches broom, with straw instead of bristles. And that golf club will change into a rune-covered staff fitting a wizard.”<br />
Without much time going by both objects changed their shap to fit Ty&#39;s wish. Mark tried an angrier commanding tone: &quot; You will stop this now, you ungrateful ...&quot; Ty had stopped him with a silent wish for them to stop speaking, not wanting to hear that tone ever again from Mark. &quot;Let´s finish you both now. First I wish that you take a pose fitting to your new role as a mighty wizard and a bad witch. Then I wish that both your bodies will turn into indestructible plastic. Finally, you both will shrink to the same size as Dustin, with a knowing look on Mark&#39;s face and a mad look on June&#39;s face.”<br />
Neither Mark nor June could do anything as they both took a fitting pose. Mark stood with his staff near like an additional support on his left side while his right one was stretched before his body as if to cast something. June leaned back a bit and pushed the broom down under her skirt as if she wanted to fly on it. She opened her mouth as if she wanted to laugh like crazy, while Mark showed his now white teeth in an knowing smile. Both felt itchy as their whole body turned into cold plastic and soon both also felt cold. Then they started to shrink down with an additional tickling feeling, until they were the same size as Dustin. <br />
Ty then wished silently the same things for them as for Dustin, so they wouldn´t go crazy, wouldn´t need anything to survive, still had their senses while the sense of touch doubled and nobody would remember them as humans. They couldn´t move anything, but were movable from outside forces, and Mark&#39;s staff and June&#39;s broom were more like extentions of their bodies, not to be removed.<br />
Afterwards he took both new action figures from his carpet and placed them on his desk, right next to Dustin, which Ty had placed their before he had started their changes. All were now facing the mirror in Ty&#39;s wardrobe and could see each other and themselves in their newly created prisons that were mere toys to Ty. “Finally I have my peace from you all and can do what I want. We will see if you will get more company later. But I will give you one thing, I wish you to be able to talk with each other, so you aren´t as alone.” With that said Ty left his room with a satisfied smile.</p>
