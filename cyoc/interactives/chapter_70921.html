<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You might not believe it, but I was there when it started. Back when this town was normal, I watched the box being opened and, though I didn't <br />
realise at the time, the chaos being set free. <br />
<br />
It was opened by my friend Lysander. His parents are hippy types, that's where the name comes from. He worked at the tabletop games store <br />
by the college, which suited us well since we were all frequent gamers. That's where he'd got the box from. It was a perfect cube, about the <br />
size of of a bowling ball, and made of dark wood with faded paint. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a card game,&quot; Lysander told us, &quot;It's gotta be really old. One appraiser told us it was at least 13th century, but that can't be right because <br />
the writing's in pretty good english. It's been passed round from store to store. Nobody's been able to sell it. Nobody knows how much to sell it <br />
for.&quot;<br />
&quot;You bought it?&quot; asked Alex. <br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Lysander, &quot;But nobody'll miss it.&quot;<br />
Alex scowled. Lysander was always pulling crap like this. Back in high school, he'd nearly been expelled for starting fires. Since then we'd made <br />
it our mission to keep him out of trouble. I guess we failed. He opened the box.<br />
<br />
Inside were four neatly arranged decks of cards. Three of them were identical, with tall Tarot-style cards. They had red celtic patterns on the <br />
back. The fourth deck was made of smaller cards, with white celtic patterns on the back. They were all dog-eared and faded by time. Lysander <br />
took out a leaf of parchment paper and began to read the rules.<br />
<br />
This was at Alex's house, in the basement. The three of us were sleeping over, while his parents were out of town. We did this quite often, since <br />
Alex has -had- the nicest house. That's what I like about Alex. He seemed the perfect type to become another dumb jock. Wealthy parents who <br />
tried to spoil him, a natural on the school athletics team, tall, muscled and handsome. But he was the sweetest guy you could ever meet. He <br />
had moved here a few years back and was quickly accepted by the popular crowd. Except one day he saw us playing 'Magic: The Gathering', got <br />
out a deck and asked if he could join. He's been hanging out with us ever since. I wondered, as I often did back then, how he'd react if he knew <br />
how desperately in love with him I was.<br />
<br />
Joe was the only one who knew that I was gay. When I realised I had to tell someone, and he was my oldest friend. I didn't need to worry about <br />
him blabbing since he spoke so little anyway. I had defended him from bullies back in kindergarten, and he'd followed me around ever since. <br />
He was a bit of yes man, laughing at our jokes, agreeing with our opinions, desperate to try and be 'cool'. If had any idea what 'cool' was he <br />
wouldn't have chosen to hang around with us. However, in the days to come we would all learn precisely how little we knew about him.<br />
<br />
My name is Paul, by the way. You don't need to know anything else about me.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, we shuffle the decks,&quot; Lysander said. We each took one and did as he said. I had one of the tall decks, and took a glance at the card <br />
faces. They were all bizarre, hand-painted images, bordered by ornate, hand-written instructions. People and animals in peculiar positions and <br />
pained expressions. Bones and lightning and fire. We finished shuffling and laid them all on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Lysander said, one eye on the rules &quot;We each take three of the red cards. These are spell cards, which we can cast on ourself or an <br />
opponent. We can only cast one spell per turn and they each last until the end of the turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
We all picked up three cards, from whichever red deck. I looked over mine and frowned. The spells were bizarre and oddly specific, and made <br />
no mention of hit points, attributes or any other type of rule. I couldn't work out how their effects translated into the game. Who knew if they <br />
gave an advantage or not?<br />
<br />
&quot;The turn starts when we turn over one of these white cards,&quot; Lysander continued, turning over a card as he spoke, &quot;The white cards are 'Quest <br />
cards'. They each have a goal written on them that we have to try to achieve. Whoever achieves the goal first wins the point and ends the turn. <br />
First person to a hundred points wins.&quot;<br />
We looked down at the quest card.<br />
<br />
THERE IS A CREATURE IN THE FOREST THAT MUST BE SLAIN.<br />
<br />
We waited. Lysander looked at the other side of the rule page, which was blank.<br />
&quot;Is that it?&quot; I asked<br />
&quot;Apparently,&quot; said Lysander.<br />
&quot;What creature?&quot; Alex said, &quot;How do we slay it?&quot;<br />
&quot;How should I know?&quot;<br />
&quot;There must be pieces missing,&quot; Joe added.<br />
&quot;That sucks...&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
We sat silently for a moment, not sure what to do. Then, Lysander sniggered and threw down one of his cards.<br />
&quot;I cast a spell on you, Paul.&quot;<br />
I frowned and looked over at his card. On it was a really weird picture. It was of a man, naked and with a massive erection. Except he had the <br />
head of a donkey, which was drooling and had droopy eyes.<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; I said.<br />
&quot;'Curse of the lecherous ass',&quot; Lysander read aloud, &quot;'Every time a lustful thought crosses the curs&eacute;d's mind, he shall become more like the <br />
common donkey.&quot;<br />
Alex laughed hard. &quot;Dude! That is messed up! What the hell kind of game is this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Y'know, Alex has porn on his cable,&quot; Lysander said, &quot;Guess you'll have to skip it. No boob for you, you lecherous ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
I glanced at Joe, who looked back at me. I forced myself not to look at Alex, in case he'd see into my mind and learn the type of porn I actually <br />
watched. And who I thought about when I did. Lysander was only doing this 'cause I spoke about sex so rarely. I doubt he suspected. I decided <br />
to play along.<br />
&quot;Well, I cast a spell on you too!&quot;<br />
Alex 'oooh'ed, and Joe quickly joined in. I threw down a card. It had a picture of statue, a woman, pretty much naked, holding her head and <br />
screaming horribly.<br />
&quot;Curse of the gargoyle,&quot; I read, &quot;If the curs&eacute;d is scared he shall turn to stone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lysander pretended to tremble and then went deathly still. We laughed. Alex said, &quot;This game is weird. Let's play Halo.&quot;<br />
So we did, leaving the game where it was.</p>
