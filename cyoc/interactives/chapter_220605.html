<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen continued through her day as normal, only lying once and finishing out her second row of legs. As the day continued she realized a frightning thought, there was an assembly today, in which she would have to give a short speech to the student body as captain of the cheer squad and this being her senior year, it would have to be a goodbye. In panic she pulled the speech out a lunch and read it over, seeing no lies in it that she could discern she calmed down and went about her day.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
The moment had arrived the students sat bored in their seats, as she went on, her speech was dry and standard, the usual of looking forward to the future and aspiring to greatness for themselves and so on. Jen continued, her speech having no effects until the last minute. <br />
<br />
&quot;And so with this being my final year with you, I wish you all good luck in the future...&quot; Jen said, this was not a lie, &quot;...and I love you all.&quot; This was a lie, Jen started to walk away from the podium until she felt a familiar feeling, She looked out into the crowd, everyone seemed frozen in place as the curse started to take hold, everyone except Kyle.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Kyle stood at the floor in front of the stage, her body making it impossible to sit in the seats here. Having finished the speech, Jen walked away from the podium, her circle of legs scuttling along like a spider, which Kyle found amusing, but then she froze, looking around in panic, she let out a scream as he heard a low rumble. Kyle looked around at the crowd and realized that everyone was frozen, she looked back at Jen and watched in amazement as curse began it&#39;s work.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Jen screamed as the third row of legs began growing into existence, surrounding her in a full circle in the matter of a minute,the eight pairs of legs lifted up at an angle around her because of the position of her asses she could barely see through them. She started crying as she didn&#39;t stop feeling the pressure as the next row started to grow into existence, her first set of legs shooting up directly in front of her as she let out a wailing scream of horror, the next row growing in rapidly pressing in all around her torso, twenty legs occupied this row, their asses pressed against each other fighting for space, suffocating Jen as they crowded her. The worst part was the pressure hadn&#39;t stopped.<br />
<br />
Jen fought for space with her sexy forest of legs as another set grew in front of her to her left, her knees pressed against her face as the legs grew in tightly her body shifting only slightly to accommodate for the new row as it grew in, Jen screamed as more and more legs grew into existence, now sporting five rows of legs the changes continued and sped up, row after row grew into existence, her body shifting slightly as each row pressed against each other and her torso, barely able to move her first row, the squeezed tightly against each other as the growth seemed endless. Five rows became six, then seven, and eight. Jen now completely blind to the outside world had stopped screaming and was just sobbing as she was surrounded by her nightmare, a wall of mocha flesh surrounded her, she could feel every inch of every leg, every single pussy buzzing with pleasure as it came into existence, sobbing became mindless moaning, having forgotten herself as the growth slowed. <br />
<br />
All in all she was now surrounded by fifteen rows of legs, each adding two pairs on top of each other, totaling at five hundred and forty legs, a total of two hundred and seventy pairs, she couldn&#39;t move, her legs crowding each other to the point that their was barely a gape for her to breath, her now claustrophobic ball of legs was everything that she feared, and the pressure was still there. That&#39;s when she realized the curse wasn&#39;t done with her.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Kyle had at first found this amusing, then arousing, then horrifying, she didn&#39;t realize that this could be an outcome, she now stared at the ball of ebony legs standing on the stage, it didn&#39;t move, and Kyle started to fear the worst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen! Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Jen couldn&#39;t hear Kyle, her wall of legs deafened her, but she felt the same pressure tha she felt while growing start to shift her body. her legs were spreading outward, her wall of flesh shifting away from her as the curse did it&#39;s work, slowly the legs shifted where they were attached to as the spread outward, becoming more of a cone shape, Jen&#39;s torso was lifted upward as the legs stretched, she felt row after row of her feet start touching the grown, the hips and legs growing in size as the shifted their position. <br />
<br />
Kyle stared in amazement as the changes continued, row after row of legs, stretching and expanding as the grew outward to set their feet flat on the floor, when the changes were done, Jen had been lifted nearly twenty feet in the air, her outer most pairs of legs were now gigantic, Jen stare in shaken amazement and dread as the changes finished, now an even bigger freak her tiny torso surrounded by an outer circle of thirty two pairs of black giantess legs, each measuring nearly twenty four feet from waist to two, her legs bent at the knees to accommodate for the descending numbers of legs, and at the bottom of this gigantic skirt of legs, were the original four, hidden in the center and dangling in the air. <br />
<br />
Jen was too shaken to react as the crowd started clapping, as if to applaud the display that the curse had given them, Jen waved, trying to act natural as she scanned the crowd for Kyle, she wasn&#39;t sure whether to try and force him to change the curse, or whether to stomp on him with one of her now massive outer feet, but she knew one thing, she was going to make him pay.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jen now has 540 legs, with 64 in her outer row, descending down to 8 in the center.</p>
