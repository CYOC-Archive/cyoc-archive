<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle nodded and ate from the lunch provided. It wasn&#39;t a super fancy lunch, and nor was it likely the healthiest lunch, but then Michelle had never really known for public schools to provide the most nutritious meals that would fit the sorts of workout and athletic regimens she preferred. She also privately figured they&#39;d help weres out even less, and probably especially werehorses if Hank was right about them being more athletically minded among weres than others. Though, in many ways, she was happy to see Hank again and be able to talk with him over lunch. She wasn&#39;t as much of a flirt as Jasmine was, but that didn&#39;t entirely mean she didn&#39;t have some interest and in a way, Hank seemed to hit all the right buttons in having similar interests as her and could also explain more on why Moon Lake didn&#39;t have official sports teams, which in turn was helpful to Michelle. It brought out a bit of a crush, that she didn&#39;t want to flaunt, partially because she wasn&#39;t like Jasmine and partially because she also didn&#39;t know if Hank was truly &quot;spoken for&quot; or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;re one of the new girls,&quot; Ben said to her and flashed a small smile after swallowing his food, &quot;right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Michelle answered slowly, &quot;we moved in a day or so before all the schools here started... my elder sister, Rachel goes to the college, and she already became a werecat, which was why my family moved here, to help her adjust to it... and the girl I walked in with was my twin sister, Jasmine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she hit on me the first day she was here in first period,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;caught me by surprise... I mean, most normals that are new to Moon Lake don&#39;t jump to flirting on the first day as they&#39;re still trying to adjust to the fact that weres exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Well, we learned weres exist when Rachel was forced to become a werecat,” Michelle answered, “I think Jasmine was interested in flirting because it’s fit with how she’s done things in Florida.”<br />
<br />
&quot;She may end up finding herself a were not of her choosing and pregnant, besides,&quot; Sandra commented, &quot;or in a fight if she hits on someone who already has a girlfriend... or boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;d never challenge anyone who&#39;s spoken for,&quot; Michelle answered, &quot;and... she&#39;s been smart enough to avoid it before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Florida doesn&#39;t have the heavy concentration of weres that Moon Lake does,&quot; Pearl said with a snort, &quot;it&#39;s not an even playing field. We don&#39;t mind normals wanting to join us as weres... and we may even welcome the competition to a degree with some...&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle got some alert that Pearl was interested in Hank. She noticed Hank frown to her, so she didn&#39;t say anything, guessing that he wasn&#39;t quite into the kind of competition that Pearl seemed to be setting up. She wasn&#39;t going to provoke a fight or do anything, particularly when she also didn&#39;t know if Hank was spoken for. And because she wasn&#39;t as experienced with these sorts of things as Jasmine was, she wasn&#39;t going to press on it. Particularly when Hank seemed like the first young man she&#39;d had enough of an interest in to talk in ways that went beyond competing with, which was in part why she remained a bit embarrassed by Jasmine calling teasing her on seeing Hank as her &quot;stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure the boys here will be responsible and honest, right?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many are,&quot; Hank answered, &quot;though... between a were&#39;s naturally high libido and teenage hormones besides... that&#39;s not necessarily something one will want to gamble on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let Jasmine know... though, she may see that as me being jealous of her or something,&quot; Michelle answered, &quot;and a lot of it may not be my business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so long as she&#39;s aware of the risks involved,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;in the meantime... what do you think of Moon Lake so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far?&quot; Michelle asked after swallowing another bite of her lunch, &quot;well... it is different. I mean... my sisters and I grew up in an area where there were enough people that running into a few people as &quot;well built&quot; as my mom and sisters are was possible, but being around so many in such a small place...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more a result of Moon Lake&#39;s were population,&quot; Pearl answered, &quot;every girl were is going to be curvy, some more so than others and every boy were... well... let&#39;s just say in his transformed state Hank would split you in half as you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle only managed a gulp but couldn&#39;t hide her blush as her blood rushed to her cheeks. This was something that Hank did catch onto, as he set his milk carton down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl, you know full well that with a the induction of a new were, and particularly with regards doing that with the larger were species and sex is the means of the welcome that things would begin with me in my human form,&quot; Hank answered, &quot;there would be nothing done that would risk unnecessary pain. And you should also know that I would never force anything on anyone that wasn&#39;t ready... and that this... isn&#39;t... the... time... or... place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle noted that Hank&#39;s voice grew a bit firmer with each word that he said at the end, like he was being very deliberate. Before things could escalate, Ben jumped in and slightly nudged Michelle with one elbow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about Pearl,&quot; Ben spoke, with a teasing tone that Michelle could easily pick up on, &quot;she&#39;s had the hots for Hank for years, but has never been able to really win him over. Partially because I don&#39;t think she can keep pace with him. I mean, her fursona IS a Clydesdale.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle wasn&#39;t quite sure on what to make on that, other than that there was the knowledge that the Clydesdale was a breed of draft horse. It wasn&#39;t the fastest horse breed, but it was strong and would still be faster than a human at a full gallop.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I&#39;m not as uncoordinated as you!&quot; Pearl shot back with a snort and throwing her head back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, save that for the meeting tonight,&quot; Sandra cut in, &quot;particularly when Hank is inviting a new friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to lunch,&quot; Hank said, blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What goes on at these meetings?&quot; Michelle wondered, &quot;Hank was telling me a bit about what you do to make up for Moon Lake not having any sports teams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The meetings can be an extension of that... real racing,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;sometimes it&#39;d be stallions versus each other... others stallion versus mare. And some times there are very fun prizes... though with many of them, they&#39;re often between our parents as part of the herd&#39;s activity in these meetings. We&#39;re then left to have fun on our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... oh, my,&quot; was all Michelle could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s also something that every were group tries to manage,&quot; Hank spoke, &quot;were parents might be more tolerant with their kids being &quot;active&quot; once they&#39;re old enough to transform, but they&#39;ll also be pretty protective if an adult, be they normal or another were even suggests anything that would go between an and adult and a minor. And at times it can be a lot to take in... and that&#39;s even assuming that there isn&#39;t an induction ceremony going along with the herd meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And these sorts of things can vary from were group to were group,&quot; Sandra added, &quot;one of the werewolf packs in town has their meetings not too far from my family&#39;s home, and we can hear them as they go about some of their business. Be it howls of pleasure or triumph if they&#39;ve decided to go hunting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And is all part of things that can be complicated... and something I HAVE to attend as part of the herd I&#39;m in,&quot; Hank said to Michelle, &quot;and why I wouldn&#39;t have time to practice or work out with you after school today... I&#39;d need to make sure I have my homework done before the meeting starts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Michelle managed as she heard the bell ring, indicating that there wasn&#39;t much time left for her lunch period, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m up to a point where I&#39;m ready to join any were group. But I am thankful to make friends... and meet those who do enjoy competition...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do?&quot; Sandra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I played about every sport I could in Florida,&quot; Michelle nodded as she stood up and lifted up her tray, &quot;which is in part why I was a bit bummed that Moon Lake doesn&#39;t have anything similar... though I could understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... we&#39;d dominate the school sports leagues too easily if we did,&quot; Sandra gave a chuckling sigh, which almost sounded like a horse&#39;s knicker, &quot;but, as I&#39;m sure Hank told you... we find our own ways to make up for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And was most friendly,&quot; Michelle added, though this time she noted Hank blushing when she said that.</p>
