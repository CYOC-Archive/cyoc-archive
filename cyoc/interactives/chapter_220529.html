<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the fuck just---my body!? What the shit? How the hell did this happen!?&quot; Kevin was almost hyperventilating at this point as he realized once Alicia got off of him without finishing the sexual deed, looking like she&#39;d seen a ghost, that something was wrong. And how wrong it was indeed - Kevin had only gotten into college in the first place with a sports scholarship. And now he had seemingly inflated up with weight and his body had become soft, more of a dadbod than the sportsman he needed to be in order to keep going with college.<br />
<br />
Losing access to college would mean losing Alicia, losing all the friends he&#39;d made during his time there more or less, and coming back home a severe disgrace, looking like he&#39;d let the college lifestyle of booze and parties turn him into---into--- &quot;I&#39;m a fucking doughboy.&quot; Kevin looked down, &quot;I&#39;m a doughboy and I don&#39;t even know how it happened.&quot; The tension in the room was gone, replaced by an ambient feeling of shock. Neither could really know what just happened.<br />
<br />
Alicia for her part still loved Kevin even though his body had changed. She wasn&#39;t that kind of shallow girl. And she fully intended to find out why that happened. Near as she could tell, people didn&#39;t just put on all that weight all at once. &quot;We---We have to figure out how this happened. See if---we have to be able to reverse this! Somehow!&quot; She was by now pacing, sweat coating her form as she contemplated the source of this anomalous transformation.<br />
<br />
Her mind drifted to the way her parents behaved in the heat of her panic. <br />
<br />
She wondered if there was something they knew that she didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
They kept her away from sex. And the first time she went to go and enjoy her sexuality, her boyfriend underwent a sudden transformation that left the two of them astray and in need of answers. There had to be answers somewhere. She didn&#39;t want to go crawling to her parents. Their response would be the typical one. She hurried to get her laptop to look up anything and everything that could explain such sudden weight gain - including the esoteric.<br />
<br />
On the part of Kevin however he was sizing up the damage.<br />
<br />
His sizable belly now took up a large amount of space on his body where once there&#39;d been rippling abs. His chest was still broad and large, but now sagged, and while he could still feel strength in that chest, it wasn&#39;t capable of the allure he once enjoyed. Indeed as he experimentally flexed and tensed his arms, legs and shoulders, he found that his new weight had covered his muscles and indeed distorted his look, but the strength that got him to where he was hadn&#39;t exactly left. He was just...fat now.<br />
<br />
His arms when tensed formed a solid but completely toneless boulder of flesh - strong, sure, but unremarkable in terms of look. <br />
<br />
Kevin found himself thinking of Alicia.<br />
<br />
She had not forced him out or laughed or---anything bad really when this had happened to him. Momma always said to go for the good girls who&#39;ll be with you in the worse times. And given what this stood to do to his time with the football team, this definitely qualified as a worse time. He found himself however before long thinking about their intimacy, before the transformation had so rudely interrupted them. <br />
<br />
He found himself flushing red as he realized what was happening. He glanced at himself in a window&#39;s reflection and chided himself, &quot;Seriously? Getting turned on at a time like this...?&quot; But he couldn&#39;t exactly deny it. The newly fattened man found himself awkwardly sitting back down on the couch. Trying to not pay attention to his erection, Kevin cupped his forehead in his hands. Maybe it was just the sheer surreality of it. The fear - contributing to the nervous reaction.<br />
<br />
He remembered from a biology of human sexuality class that fear boners were a thing. And maybe that, combined with his honest feelings for her...maybe that was why he was feeling like this.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
As Alicia got her laptop, delving into a world she&#39;d never paid a second thought to, she found herself immediately disappointed. Even a cursory search online brought up weight gain in the range of weeks and months. Not instants. And the more she tried to find something on the subject, she only found weird fetish stories, quack magical equations and improbable incantations, and...King stories? She just found herself tilting her head and again her thoughts went to her parents. To why she was treated like her womb might open the doors of armageddon.<br />
<br />
Always there&#39;d been such urgency in making sure she &quot;understood&quot; how dangerous, invasive, nasty and improper sex was. Perhaps with too much urgency. Maybe there&#39;d been something they&#39;d been covering for. The more she thought about it the more likely it started to seem in light of the unreal and bizarre events she had just been witness to. <br />
<br />
Still however, she hated the thought of giving any credence to their attitudes. <br />
<br />
They&#39;d made her life unfairly difficult growing up, and she had more than good enough reason to not want them in it now, when she was facing this difficulty. Getting up from the laptop, she decided to go check on Kevin. As she walked back to the living room where they&#39;d tried to kindle their romantic intentions, she saw Kevin awkwardly sitting there. Hands on his knees. Puffing out his new belly more as he saw her enter. A blush on his cheeks.<br />
<br />
The body language said it all. &quot;You know, it&#39;s pretty basic biology. It&#39;s nothing shameful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin realized he had made it all a little too obvious, and shook his head, &quot;Yeah, but you seeing me with that going on...when I&#39;m like...like this?&quot; He gestured at his fattened form, &quot;I&#39;m just---it&#39;s not---&quot; He sighed as he failed to find his words to fit the sentiment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind. We both intended for this to be a sexual date,&quot; Alicia stated, &quot;And I don&#39;t mind seeing you even like this in a sexual light.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...don&#39;t think I&#39;m repulsive? Not at all?&quot; Kevin asked, starting to get up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Different - but repulsive? No.&quot; She then walked over to sit by him, and sighed, &quot;I looked everywhere I could think and nothing fit. Just a bunch of stories, magick, and superstitions. And even some of those ridiculous spells didn&#39;t promise putting weight on a person as fast as---&quot; She cupped her face in her hands, stress leading her to chuckle awkwardly, &quot;I just...I don&#39;t know. And I feel like, a girl as---as basically competent as me, I should be able to know. To help the guy I like not lose his scholarship.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing she was not having a good time of this, Kevin leaned in and kissed her forehead, &quot;Hey. Worse comes to worse, I&#39;ll just---I&#39;ll borrow Seth Johnston&#39;s roids. Rich boy like him gets the high end, low side effect stuff. See if I can make a linebacker body out of this. Y&#39;know. Make lemonade given I got given some lemons today?&quot; He laughed - like her - awkwardly and trying to defuse the stress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want you having to jump on drugs just to stay...&quot; Alicia shook her head. She felt frustrated, without direction, like there was nothing she could accept as a way forward. And she couldn&#39;t lie that the denial of today&#39;s affirmation of her womanhood was also playing a part. Her first time having sex and it was a disaster like this. It was so many different kinds of frustration all joined together.<br />
<br />
And for his part, Kevin could tell that Alicia was having a bad time of it.<br />
<br />
He got up and said, &quot;You obviously need some stress relief. And...probably other kinds of relief. This was supposed to be your first time, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin, I can&#39;t ask you to have sex with me again when the first time---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine...&quot; He whispered to her. Even with all this weight on him, the jock was still the charismatic, kind and relaxed guy that she had invited up to her room to have sex with. &quot;Let me just...help you relieve some stress. Blow off some steam. You need to feel good right now. You deserve to.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alicia didn&#39;t move to stop him when Kevin knelt down and picked her up in his arms. She rested against his gut and somewhat against his chest, and as he walked toward her bedroom, holding her up, she asked in a quiet tone, &quot;But your body---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Is still strong. Just chunkier. Now...&quot; He smiled despite himself as he let her down on the bed, &quot;You don&#39;t mind having sex with a heavier man, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite all that went on today, the disaster of her first time, everything---she couldn&#39;t deny it. Kevin was still despite it all every bit the man she wanted. &quot;Yes. Yes, dammit, yes.&quot; And as she laid back on the bed, she felt Kevin starting their new session of intimacy. He climbed closer to her crotch, and began darting his tongue - back and forth - against her pussy lips. She gasped, and the stress immediately got a release valve. Biting her lip, Alicia gripped the sheets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...ohh Kevin! Oh Kevin you&#39;re so talented!&quot; She moaned aloud, feeling him teasing her - licking faster at first, then slower, and then faster again. <br />
<br />
Kevin smiled as he leaned into the sexual act. He could downright see the tension melting from her body as she laid there. Her moans getting louder and thrilling him as he saw her squirming, trying to keep still and failing to a degree. He&#39;d always been a good lover. Sure some people said the hunk with a dozen lovers didn&#39;t love any, but Kevin saw it more as a different kind. He made sure that every woman who went out with him had a good time.<br />
<br />
Now he wasn&#39;t exactly staying off of his own pleasure. At first he tried to grip at his cock, but even with it hard as could be his belly kept getting in the way. But when his hand brushed by the jangling nerves of his nipple, he&#39;d almost stopped licking his girlfriend&#39;s pussy just to gasp. When he&#39;d been muscular and conventionally attractive, his nipples never felt like that before. But pinching it now - really pinching it - made Kevin&#39;s cock bob up and down against his belly. A grin playing out on his face.<br />
<br />
A splash of liquid against his face though and he realized she just came.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...oh my fucking---Kevin! Holy shit!&quot; She murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Experience is the best teacher.&quot; He grasped her legs and looked up at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you---?&quot; She asked somewhat timidly. After all, the first time, he&#39;d ended up like this. She had renewed trepidations as she yearned for what Kevin could provide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I what?&quot; He asked in an impish sort of teasing tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Fuck me...&quot; Alicia whispered.<br />
<br />
And that was all Kevin needed to hear. He said, &quot;Here we go...&quot; He lined up, adjusted his belly so that he didn&#39;t crush her too much - though as he started pressing his cock against her lips, she seemed to grip and feel up his new form by instinct. He was still even with all the fat a very sizable man, and so when it entered, Alicia gasped in pure pleasure and he took that as invitation to begin pumping his hips...</p>
