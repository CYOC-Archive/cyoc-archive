<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You've had one hell of a day. First the paperwork for a customer was suppose to be on your desk first thing this morning but it wasn't. You had to scramble to find it which you just barely did. Then Carl yanked it out from under you getting the commission for the sale. The sales office was held up and you spent the next two hours with a gun to your head. One of the two men fondled you and said he was going to have sex with you. The stand-off with the police ended when a fire started due to a mouse chewing through the wiring. The fire scared the man holding the gun to your head so bad that he pulled the trigger. Fortunately he had jerked his hand just before pulling the trigger and the bullet just missed you. Then due to a bank error you have no money in your account since this morning and they wouldn't be able to fix it for a couple of days. In the meantime a couple of your checks have bounced and you weren't sure if the bank would wave the overdraft charges. Then you were stopped because someone had reported your car stolen. That gave you some anxious moments wondering if the cop would believe that it had been a false report. Once you were on your way again another car had ran a stop light and crashed into you. You were spun around and suffered whiplash. Your car was totaled and definitely wasn't going to be driven anywhere. By this time you had begun to think someone had cursed you.<br />
<br />
You were relieved to finally get home. Your relief was short lived however as you found a strange woman sitting in a chair in your living room. &quot;Who the hell are you and what are you doing in my house?&quot; you asked the anger evident in your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need to take that tone with me,&quot; the woman said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell there isn't,&quot; you said glaring daggers at her. &quot;You're in my house with out my permission. That's called breaking and entering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down,&quot; the woman said still smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to calm down when you've broken into my house?&quot; you asked incredulously. &quot;I've had one hell of a day just about being shot and getting into an accident and you want me to calm down when I see someone I don't know in my house. I don't even know why I'm talking to you. I'm calling the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do that and you won't receive the gift I've come to give you which you obviously could use,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; you asked with a snort. &quot;Take me away from this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I am going to take you away from this life,&quot; the woman said. &quot;And before you say anything I'm not going to kidnap or kill you. You're free to refuse my gift and you won't hear from me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if that's true then get out,&quot; you said pointing to the door for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't even heard or seen what my gift to you is,&quot; the woman said leaning forward. &quot;Once you see I'm sure you'll accept it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright show me,&quot; you said being skeptical about this gift.<br />
<br />
The woman got up and started walking toward you. &quot;Don't be afraid,&quot; she said in a calm soothing tone. &quot;I'm not going to hurt you but I do need to touch you.&quot; She raised her hand and before you could do anything she lightly touched your face.<br />
<br />
Your eyes grew wide as you started to shrink. You knew you were shrinking since your eye level kept changing. Then you figured out that you weren't just shrinking but you were getting younger. You watched as the years melted away. You had been in your thirties and now you looked like you were fourteen and getting younger. You passed thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, and finally stopped at five. All this time your clothes had been getting more loose and more loose on you until your feet were swimming in your shoes and socks, your pants and underwear were pooled around your ankle, and your shirt hung off you like a tent. &quot;Wh-wh-what did you do?&quot; you asked startled by how your voice sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have the power to change someone's body,&quot; the woman said squatting down to your eye level. &quot;I'm going to give this power to you if you accept it. Before you say anything though I need to tell you the limits. Like I said I can change someone's body. I can change their age, height, weight, sex, muscles, hairiness, skin color, eye color, hair color, facial features, and pretty much anything that has to do with the body. I can't make anyone inanimate and can't turn someone into an animal. I can't change someone's mind but I can change someone's brain to block memories or unblock them. I can heal people or make them sick. I can bring someone back to life if they've been dead no longer than three days or I can kill them. All this with just the briefest and lightest of touches on their bare skin. I'm not the only one that can do this either. I'm sure you've heard of people who heal others merely by touching them. They are ones like me. We call ourselves Body Benders because we bend other's bodies according to our will. It's a great power though with all that power we can't change ourselves. Another of our kind can change us though. Now would you like this gift I'm offering you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You thought about it. You would like this power. You could have fun with it and help people. &quot;I'll accept your gift,&quot; you said smiling. &quot;What do you have to do to give it to me?&quot;</p>
