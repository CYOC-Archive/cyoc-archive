<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you push hard against the cold stone door, you begin filling your mind with images of yourself.<br />
<br />
Your a typical male, with average build. Although, you are on the husky side thanks to your constant time on the Xbox and computer. Not to mention your obsession with Anime and Manga, both of which you can't live without of. There is also D&amp;D, RPing on forums... and countless other things.<br />
<br />
*Okay, okay! I get the picture. Yeesh, not the best looking fella are you? Still... there is some charm to you. Don't be so hard on yourself, kid*<br />
<br />
You wince at the cold reality. It's true, your not the best looker. But there are some good qualities. You have long brown hair that seem to be the style now in days. You also have a kind face with deep caring green eyes. Your personality is also another great trait. You are a kind individual, devoid of any malice or evil. Of course you have some hatred to some people in your life, but what human doesn't?<br />
<br />
As you muse over your short comings and other traits, the stone door starts to give way underneath your constant pushing. With an eerie and loud groan, the door pushes enough inward that you can comfortably walk inside.<br />
<br />
*Air! I can smell the fresh... ish... air! Oh, um... please don't be put off by my appearance. Its been over two thousand years since I have been able to move, let alone walk. The wards the monks put on my tomb have... diminished me in many ways.*<br />
<br />
You nod, and begin making your way inside. It is a spacious area, filled with burnt out candle sticks and incense. Torn scrolls covered the walls, obviously made from the demon's attempt at escape. The small blue fire ball makes its way over to the middle of the area. The sound of heavy chains scrapping on the stone floor echo and bounce off the walls around you. &quot;Well don't just sound there looking in awe,&quot; a small and almost child like voice calls from the center, &quot;hurry up and make your way over here. Time is of the essence and we need to act fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice puts you off slightly. It was certainly the same voice you heard in your head throughout this little endeavor. But it was as if the voice had been dragged back a few years into its childhood. With some time you manage to find you feet again and begin walking once more.<br />
<br />
What you see shocks you and almost puts you in a fit of hysteria. In the middle of this demon chamber, covered in heavy chains from head to foot, was the smallest demon you had ever seen in your life. The creature had to be the size of a ten year old, its body skinny and deprived of any nourishment. The demon, to your eye, had only one distinguishing demonic trait and that was the skinny spaded tail that was chained down to the ground. Otherwise, this creature looked like a very food deprived young boy.<br />
<br />
He had long dark black hair, so long in fact that it touched the ground and pooled around his fallen body. His eyes were the deepest blue you have ever seen in your life. They look at you with a sense of joy and sadness. He wears skimpy, rag like clothing that cover his chest and nether regions. &quot;Got enough of your peep show?&quot; The demon asks in mock humor. He smiles once, revealing another demon trait. He had long sharp canines that protruded outward, like a vampires. &quot;Lets get started. First I need strength so that I can break these chains and take us out of this horrible place.&quot;<br />
<br />
He motions for you to kneel next to him, and you do. &quot;What I am about to do,&quot; he explains, &quot;will bind us together forever. We will both live as immortals... that is as long as I live. Once I die, you shall begin to age the amount you have survived for. For example, if I live for three hundred years and then I am slain, then you will age three hundred years... probably dissolving into dust in the aftermath.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shudder at the thought, which causes the demon child to smile again. &quot;Don't worry.&quot; he says in a confident voice, &quot;I don't intend in dieing any time soon. Now then, lets get started. Repeat after me...&quot;<br />
<br />
He clears his voice and speaks in a very regal and heroic tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, (place name here), here by swear by this oath. By binding myself to this demon I swear that I will in no way try to harm him. He and I are one, partners in life and death. We protect each other like one protects their family. And should this bound nature ever be threatened I here by swear that I will do my best to keep it from being torn apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
You repeat, word for word what the demon has instructed. As you say this you feel your body beginning to fill with some kind of heat. But it isn't uncomfortable, in fact it is very relaxing.<br />
<br />
The demon smiles and begins saying his part in the contract. But you are unable to understand it, for it is in some kind of demonic language.<br />
<br />
Once he ends, the demon looks up to you with a hopeful grin. &quot;Okay, now the last part. The exchange of blood to seal the pact.&quot; Suddenly the demon takes his lip into his mouth and takes a swift bite. Blood begins ebbing from the wound. &quot;Now, let me take in some of your blood, then you need to take in some of mine. Eer... me taking yours is easier because all I have to do is bite you. But um... because I am chained to the floor here... you kind of... have to take this blood from where I have bitten myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blush slightly at the notion, but nod anyway seeing the logic in the situation. You give him your hand, allowing him to take a small bite and draw in some of your blood. &quot;Now you.&quot; he orders.<br />
<br />
You slowly make your way down to his lips. The blood is red, like a humans. But as you slip your tongue over the wound you find it very tasty. In fact you can't get enough of it! Suddenly you are mashing your lips onto his, trying to draw in as much blood as possible. Suddenly the flow of blood stops. You sit up, looking at the demon bewildered. &quot;Well...&quot; he says in a gasping voice, &quot;that was unexpected. Sorry I had to close my wound otherwise you would have kept sucking.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blush again and nod, trying your best to keep from looking at the creature. He just shrugs and begins testing himself against the chains. &quot;Well it doesn't matter. The deal has been done, and I have fed on some blood. I should have enough power to do... this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the chains around you shatter in unison, sending shrapnel around your body, but thankfully not hitting you. The boy demon sits up, his head only coming up to your chest while you are kneeling down. &quot;Yes, yes!! I am finally free!&quot; He turns to you and throws his arms around your body, in a sobbing embrace. &quot;Thank you... thank you so much!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You are confused, but slowly you wrap your arms around the creature, giving as much comfort to him as you can.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-we...&quot; he sniffles, &quot;We should get going. Hold on tight to me okay? I am going to use some of my power to take us out of here. We won't be able to go far... but there is a spot that I think is safe enough... hold on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room began to swim and spin. All of the walls begin to swirl and transform into different colors. It takes all of your strength just to stay conscious of the disorienting space travel. As you find yourself drifting into a state of darkness the room stop spinning and the smell of fresh grass and trees surround you.</p>
