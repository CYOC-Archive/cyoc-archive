<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There is one place.&quot; Will thought as he drove to the only gay bar in town that he knew of, it was a nice place, very well put together. It took Will a good fifteen minutes to get to the bar from the mall.<br />
<br />
Pulling into the parking lot, Will took a deep breath and got out of the car. He adjusted his jacket and walked to the bar, his bag under his arm. Entering the place it was kind of busy for seven but still not bad. Walking over to the bar itself, he took a seat on the stool. Will took a moment to check the place out, he'd never wanted to step foot in it before, but it was quite nice. Turning around the bartender walked up to his side of the bar, it was a beautiful brunette haired woman, she was young. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there, my name is Lori. What can I get for you beautiful?&quot; She said in a sultry voice that made Will stammer for a bit Lori was a gorgeous brunette with long locks. She looked about 5’8”, which at Will’s new 5’3” it was a noticeable difference, luckily the heels hid his shortness. &quot;Uh...a tall blue moon, please.&quot; The girl's smirk was intoxicating, for a brief moment he thought of Megan. He shrugged, it was time for some fun. &quot;Can I just see your I.D. hun, we have to, even for the gorgeous ones.&quot; Tori said snapping him back to reality.<br />
<br />
Blushing, Will had forgotten about that, he slowly dug into his purse, searching for an I.D. he knew didn't exist. The one he used the night before said he was sixteen, definitely no where near twenty-one. He reluctantly pulled the I.D. out anyway and handed it to the girl, waiting for rejection. A smile crossed Lori's face. &quot;Oh I see, we have a birthday girl, it says you turned twenty-one last week.&quot; She handed him back the ID and immediately pulled out a shot of SoCo and lime along with his beer and a shot for herself. &quot;I'll take a few shots with you, my shift is almost over anyways.&quot; She handed him the drinks. &quot;Alright, bottoms up birthday girl.&quot; She said holding her own shot up.<br />
<br />
Stunned, Will studied the I.D. and like she had said, on the card his birthday was last week and he was twenty-one now. &quot;Megan must've swapped them, thank god, that could've been embarrassing.&quot; He said under his breath. He held the shot up and they both gulped it down, then they repeated this three more times in a row. Will smiled as the girl seemed to be very interested in him. They stopped for a moment and started talking and finally, Will felt compelled to ask. &quot;So do you just work here or are you...well into girls too?&quot; Will asked with a smitten smile on his face, if he was trapped in a girls body, what better way to live out his fantasy’s. Her gorgeous tan complexion with the pouty lips and perfect body to boot was more than enough to attract Will's advances.  The white halter top she wore showed off her ample breasts, which had to be a D-Cup at the very least, they dwarfed his own.<br />
<br />
Lori gazed into Vikki’s beautiful deep pools of blue, returning his glances. &quot;It depends on who's asking.&quot; She winked at him, pouring them another shot. &quot;By my count you have seventeen shots to go missy.&quot; She winked. &quot;They're on me though doll, so don't worry about it.” They slammed the shots, followed quickly by another round. Tori smiled, she was obviously able to handle her alcohol. &quot;To be honest, I'm bi-sexual, I like both. What about yourself?&quot; Will simply smiled, he could feel the effects of the alcohol coursing through him, he wasn’t able to drink like he used to. &quot;Well, I'm actually just getting into town, staying at my cousins while he’s away.  But I'd say I'm mostly into girls, but guys are ok.&quot; Will was obviously denying the fact that he had started to take a much bigger interest in guys, even catching himself checking them out and thinking how cute they were. Luckily, however, women were still on his attraction list, he hoped that would be one aspect of himself that would not change.<br />
<br />
As the night went on, Will and Lori continued to their conversation on just about everything, even the things they liked about their woman. Perfectly describing one another, they laughed girlishly. Finally around 8:30, a thought flashed in Will's mind. The place was slightly more busy and the activity was becoming loud so Will spoke up as he talked. &quot;Hey, you're fucking gorgeous,” Drinking had always made him cuss a lot more than usual. “and there's this party tonight at this sorority, did you want to go with me maybe?&quot; Will asked shyly, his face obviously worried about getting the big N. O. Lori smiled warmly at Vikki. &quot;Sure babe, I think I know which one you're talking about too, it’s not too far from where I live. I'm just finishing up here and we'll get going to my place. Do you mind giving me a ride hun? This doesn't exactly pay well enough to buy me a car.&quot; A bright smile crossed his young face. &quot;No problem, just going to wash up.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Will was about to turn and head toward the restroom, he ran smack into a server carrying a tray of drinks for a large party; the man dumped all the drinks directly onto Will. He felt the liquid drench his entire body with alcohol, the man quickly apologized. He laughed a little, trying to shake off some of the excess liquid. &quot;Its fine...&quot; Will was just too tipsy to really be concerned. Lori came running over to Will, towels in hand, she patted him down. &quot;Oh babe, I'm so sorry, here's a towel it's plenty big for you, go to the restroom and take those off. My house is just a couple blocks down; I've got plenty in your size to wear.&quot; Will giggled as he took the towel, dripping his way to the woman's restroom. He quickly pulled off his sopping wet clothes, even his now squeaky leather heels, leaving his soaked panties and bra on, not bothering to go into a stall, he tried to drain the liquid out of his clothes but it was no use. He tied the towel around his breasts and quickly exited the bathroom barefooted and still soaked. She smiled as some of the girls hooted at his lack of attire, he bowed for his audience. “Thanks everyone, next show’s in twenty minutes.” Lori chuckled from behind the bar as she finished up. “See ya later Andy.” She said waving to the other bartender.<br />
<br />
Lori grabbed Will's wet clothes, she shook her head and just dumped them in the trash without telling Will. &quot;They're ruined anyhow.&quot; She strolled up next to the half naked hottie. &quot;Well, you look good wet. Before I forget, my manager says next time you come he'll buy you drinks all night for that accident of yours.&quot; She kissed Will on the cheek as the walked toward his car. &quot;Wow a Jag...you’re loaded.&quot; She giggled, getting in. Will felt odd driving without shoes, he had to readjust the seat, his shorter legs couldn’t reach without the heels, but he managed to make it to Lori's house after adjusting the seat. It was a bi-level building with shared bathrooms, typical for college homes. It seemed completely empty as they walked in; there was not a soul in sight. “I like your place, its roomy.” <br />
<br />
&quot;First thing's first, we need to get cleaned up for tonight. This party is supposed to be amazing. I’m gonna make you look irresistible…shouldn’t take much.&quot; Tori gently squeezed Will’s smaller hand as she led him into the bathroom. As they entered, Will studied his surroundings, the cool tile felt great on his bare feet. There were two stalls, two sinks and even two toilets, he smirked. ‘Girls’. Before he could say anything, Lori pulled his towel clean off him with a quick tug, throwing it to the hamper in the corner. Being still wet, Tori could easily notice Vikki’s stiff nipples through her now see thru undergarments, leaving very little to Tori’s imagination. “Oh, I like what I see. I tell ya, your body is just too amazing.” She grabbed the sides of his face and pressed her lips against his. He resisted for only a moment from the suddenness of it, and then his hesitant tongue joined with hers.<br />
 <br />
The kiss lasted for several seconds; finally she pulled back and looked directly into his eyes. &quot;You taste so sweet.&quot; Tori kissed her a few more times; each time just pecks on the lips, lasting longer with each one, until once more in full embrace. Will felt so small now, without high heels, he had to crane his neck up just to kiss the comparatively Amazonian woman.  Their arms wrapped around each other, Tori’s manicured fingernails traced from the middle of his back to his wet panties, reaching under the fabric, Tori squeezed Will’s plump rear, pulling him roughly against her slightly stronger body. Will gasped audibly in surprise, he could feel Tori’s smile as she continued her onslaught of kissing and groping of Will’s sensitive body. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe this is happening, I never thought I could be with someone like this.” Will said referring to his own situation. Tori’s face glowed. “Aw, sweetie,” She kissed Vikki once again. “You’re pretty great yourself.” Kissing his now warm, soft, lips, Tori could feel Vikki melting into the kiss. “Well, lets get you clean, girlie.” Will didn’t mind it when she called him that, it made him feel right for the first time instead of how he’d feel if another guy had said that, he shuddered at the very thought. Lori had a big grin on her face as she moved to the shower stall, turning it on, she checked the temperature. “Strip baby girl, I wanna see what you’re hiding…though there’s not much hidden at this point.” She jokingly ordered as she chuckled, she removed her halter top, wanting to join Vikki in her nudity. She pulled the black miniskirt down to her ankles and playfully kicked it at in Vikki’s direction. Lori stood now in only a pink pair of polka dot panties with a black bow that could be seen from behind as well as a matching bra which held her breasts perfectly, her hands placed on her tapered waist.  Will noticed her belly button ring for the first time on her firm tummy. “Damn that’s sexy.”<br />
<br />
Looking down, he saw what she meant; his nipples were like twin spikes, easily visible through the wet cotton. Will smirked, his hands clasped around the waist of his soaked panties, Tori seemed to study him briefly before she followed his actions, and they simultaneously pulled their panties down, letting them fall limply to the floor. Will’s made a slight splat sound as it hit the ground. He looked to her perfectly tanned crotch; it was bare say for a one inch strip just above her…” You’re pierced…shit that is really hot. I’ve never been with a girl with one actually.” He said honestly, gazing at it for a few moments, it was a small chrome barbell pierced through her clit. Lori laughed. “Yes silly, you should get one…its worth it baby.” She smirked. “But you look good without it, I especially like the completely bare look.” A chill went through Will as her soft hands hovered over his baby smooth crotch, gently stroking Vikki’s wet pussy. She leaned over and kissed Will again. “You’re just too much girl.” Lori smirked, this time being the first to take off something. She stripped her bra off slowly, covering her large mounds with her arm as she held the bra off to her side and let it drop to the ground. She revealed her large breasts showing off her large d-cups in all their perfection.<br />
Will was almost drooling, he quickly stripped off the bra in the same fashion, and Lori seemed pleased with his perky c-cups.  <br />
<br />
Despite their size, Lori’s breasts seemed just the right amount of firmness, her nipples were the size of silver dollars, and they just begged to be sucked on and teased. Will’s excitement got the better of him; he unconsciously licked his upper lip as well as an all-too-familiar dampness between his legs. Will was sure she could smell how excited he had gotten, it seemed that Lori too was getting excited by studying his body. Before long though she grabbed his hand and pulled him into the shower. “We’ve only got so much time girl, I wish we had more time before the party, but we’ll be fine.<br />
   <br />
The heat had caused the shower to steam heavily. Lori had reached for her body wash and poof, dispensing a good amount. “Baby, let me, you’re body is so…tight, I just want to run my hands all over you.” She chuckled, pleading for his permission. “Trust me, you’re the one person I would want to do it right now.” Will could only smile, her expression went from pouty to girlish glee in a millisecond, it was adorable, and how could he say no to that. She slowly washed off the remnants of the alcohol from earlier, making sure to make it as sensual as possible. Suds formed over their bodies Will inadvertently inched closer and closer to Lori’s warm body. With zero hesitation, Will put his hand behind Lori’s neck and pulled her down to his level, kissing her, trying to regain some control of this encounter.  Their hands began to caress each other’s wet, soapy bodies, groping every luscious curve between the two of them. He’d missed kissing woman, they were soft and inviting, he noticed that Lori was up to her full height; Will was now on his tip-toes just to stay in their shared embrace.<br />
<br />
Had he realized how much the alcohol was allowing his feminine side to make it self apparent, Will would’ve stopped right there. But that mixed with the sheer fun of it made him shun his inhibitions, at least for the night, Lori had no idea who he really was and as long as she was a girl, he didn’t care. Their breasts were rubbing against one another’s, sparks of pleasure traveled through them both. As a man his mind was reeling, this was his fantasy, but he’d never thought he’d be a part of it, that seemed to only fuel his excitement. Will grinded his crotch against his lover’s briefly, a shiver ran through him as she glided her hand over his breasts, cupping them before she moved her attentions further south. Spreading his legs, Lori’s fingers slowly penetrated his waiting pussy. He had backed up now against the cool tile, sending more chills through his body.<br />
<br />
Will's eyes were going blank with ecstasy; her fingers massaged his excited clit. He was almost in heavy gasps, and Lori could feel the walls clenching her two fingers. She smirked, kissing softly down his neck.  “That’s nothing babe.” She stopped abruptly, leaving Will in his excited state, he whined before he realized he’d done it. “Why’d you stop…it was feeling so good.”  Lori rinsed her sexy body off and helped Vikki do the same. “You’ll see.” She turned the water off and immediately grabbed them both a towel from the nearby shelf, she handed it to Will. He quickly dried himself off, a smile crossing his face as he watched Lori do the same, she bent over, purposefully giving Will a view of her shapely rear, as she dried her legs off.<br />
Wrapping his towel around his breasts, which he had to redo a few times to make it stay in place, Lori, however, didn’t bother, she threw her towel into the hamper and grabbed Will’s hand gingerly. “I told you this was just the start my lovely.” She pulled him out of the bathroom; his towel became loose and eventually fell to the ground as he was dragged across the house. “Good thing no one’s around.” Lori turned her head, noticing Vikki had lost her towel. “We’re all girls here; I walk around in the buff all the time.” She smirked, leading Vikki into her room and over to the bed. “Take a seat babe and lay back for me…we don’t have to actually be at the party at 10:00, we’re going to have some fun of our own first.” She said with a wink, smacking Vikki’s rear roughly. She disappeared into her closet as Will took a seat on the bed, waiting for his lesbian lover.</p>
