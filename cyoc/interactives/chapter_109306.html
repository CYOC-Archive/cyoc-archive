<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jenn headed back into the zoo, she noticed a pair of punks, one guy, one girl, off by the side of the entrance.  She paused and watched them, noticing they had what looked like a duffel bag between them.  The two conversed, and after a few seconds, both reached into the bag and pulled out spray paint cans.<br />
<br />
Jenn suddenly guiltily realized that because of what she had done to the guards, these vandals were going to get away with their act.  Normally, she didn&#39;t care.  But there were 2 things gnawing at her about this situation: 1) It was her fault the guards weren&#39;t patrolling to keep an eye out for vandal and 2) No-one is going to miss some no-good vandals who go missing... What a perfect opportunity to get a few more parts!<br />
<br />
She calmly slowly walked on the sidewalk near where the two were painting, careful to not draw their attention.  As she got close, the girl punk glanced over at Jenn and told her &quot;Fuck off, leave us alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenn took that as the moment to strike.  She leapt out and tackled the boy from behind.  A few seconds later, he was out cold from a good combo hit to the skull - both Jenn&#39;s fist and the pavement.  The girl took that opportunity to punch Jenn firmly on the side of her jaw, knocking her off her latest victim.  The girl leaped onto Jenn and proceeded to punch Jenn repeatedly in the face.  Surprised and overwhelmed by the attack, Jenn reached up and grabbed for anything she could.  Her hands found the girl&#39;s head, grabbed hold, and pulled.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s head snapped off her body, and her body stopped moving, mid-swing.  &quot;What the fuck?!?&quot; screamed the disembodied head between Jenn&#39;s hands.  The girl&#39;s body, still unmoving, tilted and fell to the right of Jenn.  &quot;Freak, give me back.. ME!&quot; the head screamed.<br />
<br />
Jenn tried to cover the head&#39;s mouth with her hands, but the head bit her, making her recoil and drop the head on the ground.  &quot;OW!  Someone get this freak!&quot; the head kept screaming.  Panicking about the potential attention, Jenn did the only thing she could think of: She picked up the screaming head, and stuck it on her right shoulder.<br />
<br />
The head stopped screaming mid-word, its mouth hanging open as it touched Jenn&#39;s shoulder.   She felt strange - something was different from before.  Even more scared, Jenn looked to the right as both her original head, and the newly attached head shifted left so they shared an equal portion of her shoulders.<br />
<br />
The eyes on the other head had closed, and its mouth was hanging open slightly.  Jenn was scared that she couldn&#39;t feel or control it.  This wasn&#39;t at all like the time when she had taken the guard&#39;s head.  Jenn waited and waited for anything to happen.  A few seconds later, a woman with a small girl walked by, glanced at Jenn and motioned to the child to stay away from her.  Jenn blushed and scooted herself away from the path and up against the wall.<br />
<br />
That was when Jenn noticed a weird intermittent hissing.  A few seconds later she realized what that noise was - the other head was snoring softly!  She looked over at it, and was stunned - It had changed dramatically.  It now looked exactly like her.  She reached up with her left arm and poked at the snoozing head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waking up while already awake was an incredibly bizarre feeling.  As she rubbed the sleep out of her right pair of eyes, her left head wondered why it felt so different from before.  A moment later, her right head thought that it must be because she was thinking two things at once.  And she was right: She was thinking in both her left and her right head at the same time - two simultaneous thoughts in a single consciousness.  That&#39;s when it clicked: she had added her newest head while it had been conscious.  That must be what had allowed her consciousness to expand.<br />
<br />
She wondered if she would have a similar success if she only attached conscious heads.  The boy punk was still unconscious from the knocks to the head.  Jenn decided to wait until his head was conscious before attaching it.  That still left the rest of his body, and the leftovers of the girl&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Eager to expand on her form, and still wistfully thinking of the horse and taur forms she had just had, she decided to make herself a taur again.  But this time, a longer taur.  She knelt down near the girl&#39;s body and carefully lined up its shoulders with her butt.  A swift push, and the punk girl was gone entirely - all of her now part of Jenn.  Jenn had made herself a taur again, but this time she had spared no parts - there was an entire torso length between her front and back legs, and a pussy between both pairs.<br />
<br />
Her lower torso still had the breasts and arms - both of them pointing downwards directly behind her front legs.  As she stood up, she felt her new pair of breasts jiggle against the back of her legs.  It felt good, and her left head decided to fondle her new down-facing breasts with her new down-facing arms.  While she fondled herself, her right head turned her attention to the still unconscious boy.  She was able to easily pull off the boy&#39;s head, and set it aside.  Then, she positioned herself the same way as before.  The main difference was the extra body was not attaching to her original bottom, but to her 2nd bottom!<br />
<br />
A quick pop and a tingle as her newest acquisition morphed to match her flesh, and Jenn had changed herself into a 2-headed, 6-legged taur with 2 arms and 2 breasts on her front, 2 arms and 2 breasts hanging down from her middle section, and 2 arms and a penis hanging from her back section.  Her left head took the opportunity to expand her little session of self pleasure to include fondling her new penis.  She was careful to not stimulate herself too much, as she wanted to make sure she would be able to react quickly once the boy&#39;s head woke up.<br />
<br />
<br />
She waited patiently for the boy&#39;s head to recover consciousness.  At least her right head did.  Her left head continued to pleasure herself, roving over all of her erogenous zones.  She felt the pleasure in both of her heads, doubling the raw pleasure experienced, without overpowering her minds.  A few minutes in, she also discovered that her 3rd section had grown a pair of breasts in the same placement as her middle section, despite starting out male and still retaining its male gender.  It didn&#39;t particularly matter why, she was just pleased they were there.<br />
<br />
After about 10 minutes of waiting and fondling, Jenn decided to take better advantage of her new multitasking capabilities and go look for more &#39;donors&#39;.  Eager at the prospect of getting even more body parts, she stopped fondling herself, picked up the head, and walked back into the zoo.  She was naked, but that didn&#39;t seem to phase anybody - &quot;It must be because of my much bigger body&quot; she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Walking around the zoo, she discovered where she left the first security guard&#39;s head, outside the reptile house.  The head, seemed more confused than anything else; it wasn&#39;t screaming or making a scene.  A few people walked by, and asked the head for directions, which she gave with a smile. The head hadn&#39;t spotted Jenn yet, and the reptile house gave her an idea.  She rushed into the reptile house on her 6 legs.<br />
<br />
Once inside, she located the snake exhibit, and snuck into the back through an unlocked and propped open access door.  The access corridor split into a T past the snake cage, and a mop bucket and janitorial cart was there.  Jenn quickly moved into the snake cage before the janitor came back.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t particularly phased by the snakes - after her experience with the horses, she expected the snakes to generally ignore her.  And they did just that, which made it very easy for her to make her picks.  She picked 2 large snakes, both with beautiful red and green stripes.  They were about 5 inches in diameter and each about 18 feet long.  A couple quick tugs and the heads were pulled off both the snakes, leaving the bodies immobile and flexible.  She also pulled at about the 16 ft mark, where the tails started to taper down, separating the back of the tail from the larger mid-section.<br />
<br />
Jenn then took the snake tails and pulled them apart into 8 sections, each about 4 feet in length.  Then she pulled the arms off her middle and 3rd section, and attached them to her upper section, giving her a total of 6 arms on her upright torso.  She looked her heads at each other and inhaled 2 deep breaths.  She was ready to try her plan.  But first, she put down the unconscious boy&#39;s head near the door - If the snakes didn&#39;t react to her, hopefully they wouldn&#39;t react to him.<br />
<br />
In 4 of her arms, she held a 4&#39; long segment of snake tail as thick as her neck.  With her other 2 arms, she carefully grabbed hold of her right head and closed its eyes.  With a deep breath, she pulled and felt it disconnect.  She paused and waited for her double train of thoughts to thin back down to a single track of thoughts.  But it didn&#39;t happen.  She tried opening the eyes on her right head, and to her surprise she did, and could see through them.<br />
<br />
Cautiously, she turned the detached head to look her attached head straight on.  &quot;Hi Jenn, I&#39;m Jenn.&quot; &quot;Hi Jenn, I&#39;m Jenn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.&quot; &quot;Whoa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; &quot;Freaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess even though my heads aren&#39;t connected any more, we&#39;re still just me.&quot; &quot;Right.  I&#39;m still one person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenn could have carried on conversation with herself for much longer, but she was more curious about her plan.  Holding her detached head out of the way, she reached up with her 4 snake-holding arms, and carefully attached 4 of the snake sections in a line on the right side of her shoulder.<br />
<br />
As each section attached, she gained feeling in it, and could move it around.  Each section had both the flexibility and the strength of a snake&#39;s tail.  She tried waving them around, and once satisfied with the precision and control they offered her, she raised all but the right-most section to be fully vertical.<br />
<br />
The right-most section she moved so she could see it from her attached head, and then maneuvered her detached head to line up with the snake segment.  A short motion later, and both of her heads were physically connected again.  She raised up her right head, and immediately became dizzy.  Not only was her right head now 4 feet higher than her left head, but it had just gone through motions equivalent to an entire rollercoaster ride in just a few moments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jenn quickly acclimated by bending her snake necks so her right head was only about 2 feet above her shoulders, then pulled off her left head and repeated the process on her left side.  A couple minutes later, Jenn had 8 snake-body necks coming out of her shoulders, 2 of them with human heads.<br />
<br />
She played with moving her heads around on her new much more flexible necks, and found that she had an entirely new level of freedom.  She could turn her heads around and look behind her (or down at her 2nd and 3rd taur sections), turn them up-side down, and even do dizzying tricks and other motions.  Her left head quickly became satisfied and was ready to leave, but her right head was enjoying messing around with her new head mobility.<br />
<br />
Jenn could keep playing with her heads for however long she wanted - they were now her heads.  So she decided to leave and keep playing while looking for more heads.  The punk boy&#39;s head was still unconscious on the floor near the door, and she was reaching to pick it up, but as she stepped out of the exhibit, the janitor spotted her and came running over.  &quot;Hey!  You&#39;re not allowed to be here!  You need to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely forgetting about the unconscious head in the exhibit, Jenn grabbed the janitor by the head with 4 hands and yanked up.  The janitor&#39;s head quickly detached from her body.  Before the decapitated woman had time to react, Jenn moved a snake neck into position, and attached the janitor&#39;s head to it.  The former janitor&#39;s head quickly fell into a deep sleep, and Jenn felt the same deep change pulsing through her body as when she had absorbed the punk girl&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Jenn stripped and re-positioned the janitor&#39;s body so it was laying front-down, resting over the mop bucket.  The janitor&#39;s breasts; soon to be Jenn&#39;s breasts, were dangerously close to splashing in the dirty mop water.  Jenn carefully walked backward until she felt her butt connect to where the janitor&#39;s shoulders where.  A few moments later, the janitor&#39;s body was completely merged with Jenn&#39;s body, giving her 2 more arms, 2 more breasts, 2 more legs, and 1 more pussy. <br />
<br />
The tingling spread through the new 4th section of Jenn&#39;s centipede-esque body, and a second later she could feel water against her breasts.  Her 4th pair of breasts.  She quickly stood up and turned one of her awake heads back so she could see.  The tingling had caused the breasts on her 4th section to grow to match Jenn&#39;s larger breast size, dunking them into the mop water.<br />
<br />
Jenn was furious with herself and spent some time clumsily attempting to get paper towels to the pair of arms on her 4th segment so she could dry herself off.  With 6 of her arms on her 1st section, her 2nd and 3rd section had no arms at all, so while she could easily pick up the paper towels at her front, she couldn&#39;t reasonably get them to her back.  She struggled with this for several minutes before deciding to relocate her 2nd and 3rd pair of arms back onto the respective segments.  Once she did that, she was easily able to pass the paper towels down her length to her back.  Thanks to her incredibly flexible necks, she had no trouble looking down her back to more easily control her arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
While drying her breasts and enjoying the stimuli that came with it, a thought popped into one of Jenn&#39;s heads: The security guard outside was conscious!  Afterall, that had been why she had come into the reptile house in the first place - to give her body enough room to support more heads.  <br />
<br />
Jenn rushed outside to find the security guard&#39;s head still lying on the path.  She walked up behind it, reached down and in 1 quick swoop picked up the head and attached it to one of her empty snake necks.  Like before, the head instantly fell asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Happy with her progress, Jenn decided to spend a little time just enjoying her new form without trying to find more additions.  She strolled around the zoo, happily looking at the various animals from 2 higher perspectives.<br />
<br />
About 15 minutes after absorbing the security guard&#39;s head, both of her new heads woke up.  When they woke up, her consciousness was instantly flooded with even more thought - Each head was not only capable of thinking by itself: it did so constantly.  She was still 1 person, but she now thinks with 4 brains, potentially leading to many different thoughts.<br />
<br />
Jenn found herself wanting to go home to rest, go find more people whose heads and bodies she could absorb, go absorb some animal parts, and to go store some of her parts in her car.  All at the same time.  An internal debate raged in Jenn&#39;s minds for several minutes while she tried to make sense of her new state.<br />
<br />
<i>This is so cool.  I want more.  I want to have 100 legs!</i><br />
<i>I like the heads but the centipede thing might be getting a little tricky with using full torsos.  I can go put half of the torsos in the car to make myself shorter.</i><br />
<i>I bet I could make even more improvements to myself with the animals in this zoo.  Like chameleon skin, I could look however I want.  Or octopus tentacles, or a scorpion tail or wings or monkey paws for feet or ..</i><br />
<i>This is physically tiring, with all the fighting.  I&#39;ve done so much today, maybe I should call it a day for now, and just enjoy the amazing form I have now.</i><br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Jenn&#39;s minds finally reached a consensus...</p>
