<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pair noticed the cackling of Meredith. &#39;&#39;What&#39;s happening to us? You planned this did-n-t Y-yoouuuu.&#39;&#39; Nicola stammered as she awkwardly shook and collapsed onto the ground as she overall shrunk and her teeth sharpened, her hair becoming obsidian black as her eyes became slitted pupils.<br />
<br />
James was awkwardly stumbling around before he too fell down as his ears retracted and two new triangle ears popped out of his hair which had lengthened and become orange. his body becoming more feminine and smaller, his chest jutting out into A-cups and his hips getting slightly wider together with his butt which became slightly more plump.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Not exactly truth be told, I had honestly forgotten what some of the potions did, but the ones you picked are one of those meant for magical beings, but now you&#39;re both magical beings, so congratulations I guess, not exactly what they were supposed to do i reckon but not my problem.&#39;&#39; Meredith shrugged as she looked at the tranforming duo.<br />
<br />
Nicole wanted to angrily curse at meredith but she was pained too much to utter a single word as a two pairs of horns grew out of her skull and red scales started appearing from her withering skin on her hands and feet, her fingers and toes lengthening and growing into large claws as a buff red reptilian tail burst out of her tail bone and grew spinal spikes.<br />
<br />
James winced in pain as her penis shrunk and was violently tugged into her crotch as a small vagina replaced it. Her foxy ears becoming oddly tall and fluffy as a fluffy tail of a fox popped from her too large boxers, her cute head swaying side to side while her eyes recieved slitted pupils, her canines lengthening a bit too. Then another fox tail appeared from her trousers. The now female James tiredly opened his eyes, already noticing his much more acute hearing and sharper eyesight. She noticed his unusually loose clothes hanging from her girly frame, she was too tired to continue so she fell backwards as she fell into darkness. Quickly meredith flicked out a wand and James floated up, laying asleep i nthe air as Meredith hovered her over to a newly appeared table and lay her atop it, looking back at Nicole who had finished becoming a half dragon, red scales covering her clawed hands and taloned feet, red scales following her spine and two juvenile wings thats ripped through her shirt.<br />
<br />
Groaning, Nicole raised herself from her crouched position, looking at her draconic arms and feet in shock. &#39;&#39;So? feeling like you&#39;ve gotten food poisoning?&#39;&#39; Meredith teased with a grin. Nicole looked up at Meredith with fire in her eyes, biting her already bleeding lips with her sharp teeth. &#39;&#39;Hm? Cat got your tongue?&#39;&#39; Meredith teased again. &#39;&#39;I reckon you&#39;re both worth around 10&#39;000 punds as familiars, but i reckon i&#39;ll keep you for myself if you want somewhere to call home.&#39;&#39; She cackled and turned to the still asleep james.<br />
<br />
Nicole, with firey hatred and newfound power and pridefulness from her draconic visage, leapt at Meredith wit hmuredous intent, claws outstretched to maul her. &#39;&#39;Ooookayy.&#39;&#39; Meredith mumbled swiftly bringing her wand back and hit Nicole on the head fro mwhich Nicole froze in the air. Then she seemingly melted into bright light and converged on the tip of the wand. forming a firey red ruby in which Nicole found herself trapped. Meredith cackled as she brought the ruby up to her face, looking i nat the scared Nicole who was extremely confused, and naked. showing her partly scaled skin. &#39;&#39;Thats the firey pride of a selfish dragon i recognise. I do have to say you look quite good, and you&#39;ll look muuuuch better as an adult.&#39;&#39; meredith cackled. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Now, where were we? Ah yes, You friend needs some clothes, and i reckon your prison&#39;ll make a good necklace for her.&#39;&#39; Meredith murred, sending Nicoles prison near James neck where a golden chain materialize daround her neck and connected with a holder for the ruby, faling onto the smooth flawless skin of an asleep James. Then Meredith waved her wand over james, her loose male clothes evaporating, exposing her delicate skin and puny breasts, her long hair clearly being capable of reaching her butt where her two tails lay cramped between her legs.<br />
<br />
Meredith quickly looked over James&#39;s body before flashing a grin and waved her wand over her yet again. A  red kimono with purple outlining and some outstretched flowers on the lower part of the kimono which reached down to James&#39;s knees materialized on James&#39;s body, The kimono was kind of open, showing James&#39;s breasts, chest and daint shoulders. Meredith placed her wands tip at your chest and a bunc hof bandages materialized, covering your breasts completely, while a red symbol engraved coloured itself in your skin above your covered breasts on your chest, two smaller red symbols came to be on James&#39;s exposed shoulders. <br />
<br />
Meredith took a step back smiling, eying James&#39;s body. Then she placed her wand on her head, making james&#39;s hair a dark purple, the fur on her tails and ears also became the same dark purple as her hair. &#39;&#39;Presto. She looks beautifully cute don&#39;t you think?&#39;&#39; Meredith said to Nicole who was looking out from her ruby prison, she was kind of confused at what she had seen as she so tiny in that prison of hers, she also hadn&#39;t a very good vantage point to see how James had changed and how she looked.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;I&#39;ll let you two rest until your friend wakes up from her tired sleep.&#39;&#39; Meredith chuckled as she walked off into the shop proper, the storeroom revealing itself to be some kind of magical study, the potions actually having some sort of label but they were all vague. From the roof hang several treads of different things like garlic, onions or whatever kind of magical or mythological things exists.<br />
<br />
In the other end of the room sat a couldron with a crackling fire underneath, it held a bubbling liquid of kinds inside, smoke fro mthe fire covered the roof like the carpet. Nicole, tired but furious gave up on attempting to exit her gemstone prison, she wasn&#39;t even capable, or rather she instinctively refused, to speak or shout. So defeated she was, and she knew it, and so she lay down in her prison cell  and went to sleep just like James had done...<br />
<br />
A considerable time later...<br />
<br />
James groaned as she shifted slightly on the wooden table. Her eyes flickered up, opening and closing them several times to get used to her eyes much higher sensitivity, her long ears twitching to every crackle of a fire and every sound. Weakly, James brought her eyes to over her eyes, squinting because of the light despite the room being relatively murky with only candles and flames and no electric lights. &#39;&#39;w-www...&#39;&#39; She groaned weakly. She noticed her feminine voice and froze, she quickly forced herself up but on her way to raise herself, a great pain shot up her spine, letting out a yelp as she bent to the side and shot a hand to her tails, roughly grabbing one of her tails as their sensitivity arched back up James&#39;s spine yet again causing him to gasp and let go, turning over and laying on her chest as she stared at her two purple furred tails each with a milky white end.<br />
<br />
James also noticed her kimono, or atleast it&#39;s back, looking down at her chest she saw the bandages which sort of awkwardly held her already puny bust almost flat with her chest. James hopped off the table to the floor, awkwarly standing on her new dainty feet with some difficulty of balance but shortly figured out a way to properly standwithout falling over with the help of her swaying tails. James gazed more closely around Merediths magical study or storeroom, confused at where to go now, maybe he should  try and leave, but it could be that Meredith knew exactly how to track her down, how would she even be out in the city? <br />
<br />
she wasn&#39;t human anymore, nevertheless a little girl wearing a japanese kimono. And Meredith did say that she and Nicole were magical beings now... Was it possible for her to magically disguise herself? Either way, it would be hard. &#39;Also where was Nicole?&#39; James wondered as he looked around the storeroom, being careful not to touch any of the things there incase they were something bad. &#39;&#39;N-nicole?&#39;&#39; James called, a little tickling sensation came from her odd ruby necklace, she grabbed it and looked more closely at the ruby. In it she could see a naked, black haired girl with horns and red scales covering some parts of her body. &#39;&#39;N-Nicole? Is that you?&#39;&#39; James asked, to which the trapped girl grumpily nodded. James looked around, staring oddly at her ruby necklace which was currently the prison of Nicole.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Meredith stood infront of James who gasped in surprise as she stumbled back a little, looking up at the smiling Meredith. &#39;&#39;Finally awake huh? slept well past the required amount of time of testing the potions. Did you have nice dreams?&#39;&#39; Meredith smiled at the scared two tailed fox-girl James. &#39;&#39;W-why-y am i l-like this?&#39;&#39; James stuttered to which Meredith cackled. &#39;&#39;The potions you and your friend drank were for magical beings, so then a whole bunch of wierdness happened and they didn&#39;t work as intended so they made you and your friend into magical beings.&#39;&#39; She cackled. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Oh and also, i think the potion i gave you was one that was supposed to make the drinker a 9 tailed fox, not a real kitsune, you&#39;re a kitsune, as old as what humans see as adults, you&#39;re 22 years, so 2/10th of your way through your human life so as a kitsune you&#39;re essentially around... 200 years old in relation to kitsunes. But your not 200 years old so you have a good 180 years before you actually start to properly age, so enjoy your eternal youth for around 500 years, oh and might i add that  kitsunes live well beyond 7000 years so, the age part is a bit wonky i see, there is yet to be a kitsune who have died of age. Oh and all of them are women, don&#39;t ask me why.&#39;&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Your friend however got a more, odd one, her potion is meant to make the drinker a large anthro lizard thats female, it also makes the drinker a ferocious lesbian, luckily your friends not a lesbian, but she&#39;s a half-dragon, and dragons aren&#39;t the most friendliest of magical creatures let me say, they&#39;re also a bit greedy but i reckon your friend won&#39;t have the greed for gold normal dragons have.&#39;&#39; Meredith explained with a confident smile. James looked down at Nicole in her ruby prison. Meredith chuckled some as she stepped closer to James and held up Nicoles ruby prison. &#39;&#39;I put her in there because dragons are known to have a fierce temper, And i have to say your friend is a bit of a hot-head so i took and imprisoned her in that ruby.&#39;&#39; She explained patting James&#39;s head to which she couldn&#39;t help but release a huff of comfort to, and released a huff of disappointment when Meredith took away her hand and chuckled.<br />
<br />
Then Meredith turned away and walked to the door which lead to the shop proper. &#39;&#39;You got that?&#39;&#39; She asked, James Looked thoughtful as she cocked her head in confusion, her ears following. &#39;&#39;Y-yes. I-i Guess.&#39;&#39; James said, unsure of what Meredith wanted of her. &#39;&#39;Good. What are you going to do now?&#39;&#39; Meredith asked, her smile sort of warm and kind while also being judging. James pondered at Merediths question, what WAS she going to do now? But why did Meredith want to know this? James was kind of nervous of what Meredith wanted, she was a witch after all, or whatever she&#39;s called by other magical people. &#39;&#39;I... Uh... Don&#39;t really know?&#39;&#39; James answered. &#39;&#39;Go home?&#39;&#39; She added. Meredith cackled. &#39;&#39;Well other humans&#39;ll look odd at you you-know.&#39;&#39; She replied smiling.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Out there you&#39;ll either be cast aways or trapped and studied by humans hungry for the knowledge you call &#39;science&#39;. Maybe you&#39;ll stumble across some other magical beings that&#39;ll take care of you, can&#39;t guarantee you and your friend&#39;ll stay together if that happens.&#39;&#39; She shrugged, then she looked a bit oddly to the side. &#39;&#39;Then theres a chance you get found by others like me, I cannot guarantee they&#39;ll be friendly though and they might force you to become a slave or a familiar, they might even sell you off. And before you get worried about me selling you, im a witch of my word, you payed back the crystal you destroyed and you slept well past the time of which i set up for you and therefore i won&#39;t be forcing you to stay.&#39;&#39; She said. Then with a sort of grumpy tone she said. &#39;&#39;You could also stumble into a, &#39;collector&#39;.&#39;&#39; she said, empasis on &#39;collector&#39; which with how she said it, sounded like she knew someone who did it and that it would likely not be a very &#39;good&#39; thing.<br />
<br />
James just stood there, processing the information Meredith had thrown at him. &#39;&#39;You could stay here if you wanted. Maybe become my familiar. Or i could send yo uand your friend off to another world, see if luck finds you there. If you want to of course.&#39;&#39; She added with a smirk. James looked uncertain, pondering as to what she wanted to do now. She looked down at her ruby necklace where Nicole was grumpily imprisoned, back turned to Meredith. &#39;&#39;Of course, i doubt she&#39;ll speak up so your choice affects her aswell.&#39;&#39; Meredith said with a shrug and pointed at the ruby necklace where Nicole grumpily sat.</p>
