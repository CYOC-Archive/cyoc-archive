<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucifer pondered his option in vetoing the senate decree 13666; A law that strips the right of non-blood born demons. It sickened him that this law was born from the bigotry and hatred his children had to endure. Children who were born from Queen Lilith, who also was once a human. Reading the law over, he see that Laz Deathfire did keep the clause of all humans becoming demons before earth year 2500bc was still intact.<br />
“At least she had the good sense to not pull that out from under me and my family,” Lucifer grumbling; “but the rights of succession, you wrote that out.”<br />
Lucifer grins; he has a way to get the hardliners to either vote for an immediate nullification of the decree or to ratify his ability to veto it as the document. A document he has yet to sign.<br />
“Summon the captain of the guard,” Lucifer speaking to some one on the other end of a communication portal; “tell him to meet me in the eight district of Dis and to bring thirty of his trusted troops. We have an unpopular law to enforce.”<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
“My liege,” Nergal pleading with Lucifer; catching wind of what the lord of hell was up to, he arrived to see the large goat legged demon as he was at the third estate he visited enforcing his wife’s decree.<br />
“Not now Lord Nergal,” Lucifer waving him off; “you will not interfere as I dutifully enforce your wife’s new law.”<br />
Nergal could only watch in horror as the senator was pleading with the solder’s as they dragged his son’s wife and daughter from their residence. The female once a human; now with legs of a gazelle ending in hoofs and a head of an elephant; the baby in the care of a solder as it was ripped from the mother as it was still suckling.<br />
“You voted for this law,” Lucifer now looking at the distraught senator; “if you are now finding it unpalatable because it is affecting your family, you are more than welcome to contact Laz Deathfire and lodge a protest. Or you can call for an emergency session and vote for its immediate withdrawal. The choice is yours,” Lucifer turning around and walking away with the solders and there latest batch of prisoners.<br />
<br />
It went on like this for several hours; Nergal was forced to watch as a majority of the senators who ratified this decree had their lives and residences turned upside down. Having to bear witness as their families being ripped apart and left in tatters. Children cry, parents screaming; a few senators dared to try and order the solders away. Those orders fell silent once the senator saw that it was the lord of hell among the solder’s leading this enforcement. But it was the next residence that Lucifer visited that caused Nergal to growl with rage. It was his daughter’s place.<br />
<br />
“No my liege,” Nergal finally trying to beg Lucifer to stop; “you have made your point.”<br />
“I think not,” Lucifer growling as he creates a large portal; a portal that showed Laz Deathfire on the otherside. “Senator Laz,” Lucifer stating; “your presence is required to bear witness with the enforcement of decree 13666. This is direct order from the lord of hell,” Lucfier adding to ensure there are no objections.<br />
Nergal watched as his spouse steps through the portal. Despite Lucifer’s cold demeanor at the point, he was showing civility as he helped Laz not trip as she stepped through the portal.<br />
“It is best you stand with your husband,” Lucifer looking at the perplexed demon. “Captain,” Lucifer looking at the solder; “order your men to begin.”<br />
<br />
Laz looked confused as she watched the thirty demons break down the gate and storm the estate. Asking her husband why they are there; he looks defeated as he gives Laz a quick rundown on what has happened. Detailing how all the senators that voted for the decree had their homes invaded and members of their families stripped and turned out. Family members that were human born demons.<br />
<br />
“My wife,” Nergal looking defeated; “this is our daughter’s estate. Our daughter took a human as a spouse remember?”<br />
Laz remember as her confusion turned to rage and then terror. This law was going to impact her family. Then the screaming happened solders holding back a pissed off demon who inherited Nergal’s looks but her mother’s wings comes flying out straight to Lucifer.<br />
“What is the meaning of this intrusion,” the irate demon shouting; “why is there solder’s searching my residence?”<br />
“Per decree 13666,” Lucifer stating; “all demon not born by blood are to have their rights stripped from them, property seized and marriages annulled. A decree that was proposed by your mother Laz Deathfire and quickly voted for in the senate this morning. If you have any issues with this,” Lucifer turning to stare and Nergal and Laz Deathfire; “then you may take it up with your mother and father. Who are present so they can testify that I dutifully enforced the new law with the all the zeal that it deserved.”<br />
<br />
The irate demon just glared as her lover a female demon who had seven fox tails, white fur and the head of an artic fox was being dragged out of the residence. She was seven months pregnant and already scratched up as she tried to fight the solder’s off.<br />
Lucifer didn’t say a word as he signalled the solders to head back to the prisons. He turned around to see Nergal and Laz try and console their daughter, despite the venom she was spewing in their direction.<br />
“How could you do this,” she screamed; “you risk tearing hell apart.”<br />
“Please be calm Jezzy,” Laz trying to interject; “allow me to try and smooth things over with our lord.”<br />
“There is nothing to smooth over;” Lucifer answering flatly; “your decree is being enforced to the letter. I just thought you might like to see it in action. To see it how it will impact you social circles and family relationships.”<br />
“You went too far,” Nergal shouting. <br />
“And you shouldn’t have snooped in my study,” Lucifer snapped back before looking at Laz. “Did you ask your husband where he got the proposal you so eagerly put forth to the senate?”<br />
“No,” Laz seeing her daughter’s hatred on full display. “I assumed my husband was given that draft by Lamashtu herself,” Laz trying to puff herself up; “Since she was indisposed with a family emergency I felt it was my duty to put forth the proposal.”<br />
“And now you and the entire senate just reaped what you sowed,” Lucifer opening a portal back to the palace; “when Lamashtu return’s, expect this decree to be quashed. That is if the senate doesn’t opt to convene an emergency session to discuss their error in judgement. I expect you to be in attendance,” Lucifer glaring; “if they do convene because I will be there. And I expect you to abide by my veto if it comes to it,” Lucifer adding as he steps through the portal and it shuts behind him.</p>
