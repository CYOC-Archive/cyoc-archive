<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was teen night at the local lesbian dance club, and so, at the encouragement of her friends, Michelle had gone. She hadn&#39;t felt much like partying, not really, but she knew eventually she&#39;d have to get back out there in the world. She couldn&#39;t grieve forever. At least her friends were being kind to her - even though she was mostly just sitting sulkily at the table and nursing a soda, it was nice to be there with them. The pulsing of the music and the flashing of the lights was a decent distraction for what had been a truly shitty month. <br />
<br />
Rachel had been missing for over a month at that point. A month since Michelle had last seen her sister. <br />
<br />
One day, she&#39;d been there, at home, her slightly annoying older sister who made dumb jokes and teased her...and then...she&#39;d gone for a sleepover at her friend Brooke&#39;s house...and had vanished. Just poof! Gone without a trace. Brooke had been distraught when she&#39;d found out about it, the poor girl. According to Brooke, Rachel had left her house...and had never made it home. The neighbors in Michelle&#39;s area had gone over their security footage, but nothing unusual had shown up. No one had sent the family any kind of ransom notice. <br />
<br />
Michelle wanted to hold on to hope that Rachel was out there, that she would be found and returned home, safe and sound. But she couldn&#39;t deny that it was looking more and more unlikely.<br />
<br />
Either way, it was probably a good thing she&#39;d come to the club. She&#39;d been having trouble sleeping for the past week. Every night, she&#39;d been having odd dreams. Incredibly erotic dreams. In them, no matter what the dream was initially about, she&#39;d find herself being absolutely ravished by a mysterious girl. Normally, she had trouble remembering the details of her dream - but these...these were different. When she woke up gasping, her cunt throbbing with desire, she swore she could practically feel the aftermath of that girl&#39;s tongue exploring every crevice. <br />
<br />
So.<br />
<br />
Maybe Michelle just needed to get laid. Grief manifested different for everyone, right? <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said a low voice. It was slightly raspy, and sent a tingle down Michelle&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
She turned to see an absolutely gorgeous blonde girl looking at her. She had on heavy black eyeliner and shadow, and short blonde hair that was a bit frayed at the ends. She wore a black mesh top, and no bra - the only thing covering her generously sized tits was a bit of black tape on either nipple. Her skirt - if such a small thing could be called one - left very little to the imagination, as did the fishnet leggings. Michelle found her mouth go suddenly dry at the sight of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; she found herself saying.<br />
<br />
A corner of the girl&#39;s mouth turned up. &quot;Dance with me,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Okay,&quot; Michelle said. To think, she&#39;d gotten an A+ on her last speech.<br />
<br />
She turned around to her friends and received a series of giggles and squeals. Michelle returned a shaky smile, and then turned and let herself be led off by the blonde girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kate,&quot; the girl responded. &quot;And yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
Kate simply smirked and began to dance in front of Michelle, who took a moment to join in, mesmerized by the silky smooth movements of this mysterious bombshell - Kate. Her eyes kept tracing up and down Kate&#39;s body, taking in every detail - the way her chest bounced with every movement, the exposed skin glistening with sweat and glitter...her mouth went dry looking at it. Kate saw this, and smirked a bit wider, leaning in so that they were brushing together with their movements. Her eyes were so close, staring at her with that intensity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Glad I caught you here tonight,&quot; Kate said. &quot;My lucky day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle found herself blushing. Christ, get it together, she told herself. Don&#39;t be such a baby gay. &quot;Uh, yeah...my friends finally talked me into making an appearance again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I haven&#39;t felt much like getting out recently...&quot; Michelle hesitated. It was a mood killer, but it was also constantly at the forefront of her mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;How come?&quot; Kate asked, pouting slightly in sympathy. All while gyrating to the beat of the music. Michelle swallowed heavily as Kate moved in closer, the blonde girls breasts pressing up against her arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;My, uh...my sister has been missing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry to hear that!&quot; Kate said. &quot;You poor thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle shrugged uncomfortably. &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, I&#39;m sorry...are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. But I&#39;m getting there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate smiled; watching the girls freckled face light up like that sent swooping sensations through Michelle&#39;s stomach. God, she felt like such a slob compared to this beauty. Her own strawberry blonde hair was unkempt and fraying from lack of upkeep. She&#39;d just thrown on some random party clothes - she looked more like some generic skater girl. What the hell did this girl even see in her?<br />
<br />
No, she told herself. Don&#39;t you dare question this. Just enjoy it. Have fun. Dance. <br />
<br />
And dance she did. She and Kate worked their way across the dance floor; Michelle took in every inch of the girl, delighting in every stolen touch and brush of skin. Several times, other girls came up and tried to get Kate&#39;s attention - every time, Kate turned them away, seemingly only having eyes for Michelle. She&#39;d never had someone look at her like that. <br />
<br />
It made her feel good. <br />
<br />
And more than once, she found herself examining Kate&#39;s hands. Short nails. Kate noticed her looking, and winked at Michelle knowingly. <br />
<br />
At one point, Kate had pressed herself right up against Michelle, running a hand through her hair. &quot;Can I kiss you?&quot; Kate asked huskily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah,&quot; Michelle said. It was crazy how much of an effect this girl could have on her.<br />
<br />
It was easily the best kiss she&#39;d ever experienced - it sent a thrill of pleasure straight down her spine, right down to her clit. She let out a moan of desire and pulled Kate closer, who giggled slightly into her mouth. Her silky hands slowly caressed the skin of Michelle&#39;s arms, sending goosebumps flaring up all across Michelle&#39;s body. When Kate finally pulled away, Michelle&#39;s breathing was ragged; her panties were sopping wet. She was practically ready to pin this girl to the floor, and fuck anyone else around who might protest. <br />
<br />
In the heat of the moment...Michelle never even noticed Kate pocketing an empty vial. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna go somewhere more private?&quot; Kate whispered in Michelle&#39;s ear. <br />
<br />
Michelle nodded eagerly, shuddering with delight at the thought. She could hear her friends catcalling behind her, and she laughed shakily. Kate dragged her into the bathroom and practically slammed her against the wall - Michelle let out a happy squeal, which quickly became a moan as Kate slipped a hand down her panties and began rubbing her clit. A sense of warmth spread through her body, and she moaned desperately into Kate&#39;s pouty lips, wanting to taste every inch of this incredible girl. It felt so good - Michelle didn&#39;t even know if the bathroom was empty, and at this point, she didn&#39;t really care. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god,&quot; she whispered as Kate rubbed harder. &quot;Oh god, don&#39;t stop! Ohhh! Ooooooh....don&#39;t stop! Ohhhhh....&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate laughed softly against her collarbone. &quot;Oh, I won&#39;t,&quot; she promised, and just the sound of her voice made her pleasurable sensations spike. &quot;You&#39;re so wet...poor girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle let out a long whimper as Kate stuck her fingers into her dripping cunt, sending fresh new waves of bliss spreading through her body. If she hadn&#39;t been holding onto Kate&#39;s shoulders, she surely would&#39;ve fallen over at this point - it felt so good.<br />
<br />
When the orgasm hit, it was like every nerve in her body seized up with an electric surge of pure elation. She hugged Kate tightly to her; oh, she planned on returning the favor for as long as Kate wanted, because that had been incredible. But even as she pulled Kate closer to her, she felt a tingling sensation begin to build up, and the pleasure she was feeling seemed to increase even more. She let out a shaky gasping breath and pulled Kate tighter to her, unable to believe the sensations - she&#39;d never experienced a double orgasm before - she must have been more horny than she&#39;d realized...<br />
<br />
Except...<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuuuuuuuuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
When she orgasmed again, her squeals echoing in the bathroom...<br />
<br />
The pleasure was still there, still mounting, still driving her up the wall! She could feel her clit throbbing with desire, except...everything felt...weird. <br />
<br />
&quot;What...what&#39;s going on?&quot; she moaned, shivering slightly as the pleasure continued to course through her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something beautiful,&quot; Kate whispered in Michelle&#39;s ear. <br />
<br />
Michelle was starting to feel scared now. The pleasure was mounting again, and what was weirder - she was feeling...stiff. It was hard to describe. Like when she went to move her arms from around Kate, they seemed to resist the movement. And leaned against the wall, she was finding it hard to find the strength to stand up straight. Her teeth were chattering from the sensations, and...and her skin! In the pale light of the bathroom, it seemed to be glistening, but...not with sweat. Her skin looked...off. Odd. Almost...shiny? And without any kind of blemish. Normal skin didn&#39;t look this uniform...<br />
<br />
And...<br />
<br />
Another orgasm, and she let out a shaking gasp. Kate was smiling wider, looking down at Michelle before kissing her. Michelle tried to turn away, but between the pleasurable sensations and the stiffness she was feeling, she couldn&#39;t quite do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s...what&#39;s...happening...&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
Kate smiled, and then, to Michelle&#39;s complete surprise, scooped her up and carried her towards the door. And even though Kate was no longer rubbing her, she could still feel the intense pleasure coursing through her body...and even though she was being carried, her arms and legs seemed to stick out unnaturally...she couldn&#39;t bend them...<br />
<br />
Kate grabbed the door to the bathroom and muttered something - a rush of something like static electricity filled the air for a moment.<br />
<br />
And when Kate opened the door, the club was gone. Instead, it looked to be a bedroom. Kate carried her inside and slammed the door behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to your new home,&quot; Kate said softly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are...talking...about...&quot; Michelle gasped. It was getting harder just to talk. What the fuck was going on? What was this girl doing to her??<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Kate said in a singsong voice. She looked down at Michelle with an eager look.<br />
<br />
Another orgasm washed over her stiffening body. And another. And another.<br />
<br />
And even as the orgasms continued, at a certain point, Michelle realized she was no longer able to move at all - and hadn&#39;t been for some time. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, it&#39;s so hot watching it happen,&quot; Kate said. &quot;Wish I&#39;d thought of something like this years ago. Brooke, bless your twisted mind.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brooke? Michelle didn&#39;t understand...<br />
<br />
Kate smiled down at Michelle. &quot;Awww...poor little Michelle...you know, you might even be a cuter doll than your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doll? Wait. Than my SISTER?? DOLL??? Michelle thought. Her body betrayed none of her emotions. She simply lay there. Trapped in her own body. Shit, she wasn&#39;t even breathing - how was that possible? She couldn&#39;t blink, couldn&#39;t move her eyes, couldn&#39;t feel her heart beating despite how worked up she was mentally. And...what the hell did Kate mean, her sister?<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you,&quot; Kate whispered. <br />
<br />
And show her she did. <br />
<br />
Michelle almost wished she hadn&#39;t learned the truth of it.<br />
<br />
Because the truth...<br />
<br />
Kate touched Michelle&#39;s forehead...and Michelle was forced to watch, still frozen even in the memory...forced to watch as her older sister turned into a sex doll. Watched as Brooke came in, all but molested the doll her sister had become, and then carry it off to her home. Watched with an aching heart as she saw Brooke and Kate making out on top of her sister&#39;s seemingly lifeless form...but knowing that she was still aware, crying out to be rescued and freed...even as Kate let her feel just how much pleasure Rachel had been made to feel during that whole ordeal...<br />
<br />
And Michelle finally understood what had happened to her sister. And what had just happened to her.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d been turned into a sex doll. <br />
<br />
All this time, Rachel had been trapped. Kept by her psychotic friend and used like a sex toy. Michelle couldn&#39;t believe anyone could be that cruel.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s riiiiight,&quot; Kate said. She took off the mesh top and peeled off the tape, exposing her bountiful breasts and straddling Michelle&#39;s naked form. She felt her body jiggle slightly from the movement - her silicone bits bouncing more heavily than they ever had when she was alive. &quot;Like sister like dolly! Mmm...don&#39;t worry...I&#39;ll make sure you feel good...and in turn...you&#39;ll make me feel good. In ways you can&#39;t even imagine.&quot; Kate leaned down and kissed Michelle on the lips. She wanted to scream, to protest, but...even as she cursed Kate in her head, she felt the incredible orgasmic sensations continue. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re just the first,&quot; Kate whispered. &quot;So don&#39;t worry...you won&#39;t be lonely...I can promise you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle was scared - both for herself and for her sister.<br />
<br />
But more than that, she was angry. Not just at Kate - though her magic had apparently been responsible for this in the first place. Oh, she was plenty mad at Kate...but...<br />
<br />
The fact that Brooke had been the one to think up the idea in the first place. That she had stood in their house, crying about Rachel...all while knowing her inanimate body was back in her bedroom, trapped...<br />
<br />
If I ever get out of here, I&#39;m going to KILL Brooke, she thought. <br />
<br />
But Kate simply laughed at this, and Michelle knew the odds of her escaping from this were very low. <br />
<br />
And the orgasmic sensations continued, spiking even higher as Kate grabbed her silicone tits and began to massage them. <br />
<br />
Surely, there had to be a way to get free...<br />
<br />
Surely, there...<br />
<br />
Kate slid down Michelle&#39;s body and began licking her soft silicone clit - and all thoughts of anger and revenge fled her mind as an ocean of pleasure washed over her.</p>
