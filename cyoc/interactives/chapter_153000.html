<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff is just standing there, seemingly calmly, holding his stiff, stone penis in his little boy&#39;s stiff, stony hands. Completely incapable of even the tiniest of movements. His mind raging ineffectively against this stone prison he&#39;s trapped inside of; where seconds feel like hours. Even the deepest, hottest pits of hell couldn&#39;t even be this bad!<br />
<br />
As he&#39;s standing there waiting for the release that will never come, it felt to him like an eternity has passed. In reality, he was immobilized for barely even a minute! He tries with all of his might to escape. To move even one tiny muscle. Hell, to be rid of this neverending sexual high at the very least! He&#39;d be sopping wet with tears, if he could release even those! But he can&#39;t. He can&#39;t even lift his eyes to the sky. He&#39;s stuck just endlessly and motionlessly and utterly silently staring down at his young boy&#39;s statuefied body that looked ready to piss into that still, smooth-as-glass pond before him; that felt like he was climaxed as a little pebble of sperm was locked tightly inside the head of his penis that will forever be lodged in there. On the very edge of release that would never come.<br />
<br />
At least the reflection gives him a dark, mirrored view of the green leaves on the tree, and small patches of blue sky between each leaf. Unfortunately, the majority of the view was of the unknown face of a young boy statue, agonizingly always forever reminding him of what he is: just a statue, meant to be looked at for a few moments, then immediately forgotten as the viewer goes about the rest of their life, leaving him to just continue standing in his one little patch of Earth. Never to be moved. Never to be touched except by crawling insects and the occasional bird or two. Moss would also migrate around his body eventually.<br />
<br />
As continues standing there, the day moves on, which to him felt like an entire century. The sun lowers in the sky. It turns cloudy, then the sun finally begins to disappear behind a wall of clouds just before setting.  Each and every single moment over the course of these excruciating few hours was the worst moment of Jeff&#39;s life. He can &quot;feel,&quot; of a sort through his always cold, outer rocky shell. But his utter need to actually cum, overrides most other thoughts and feelings. &quot;Cum, cum, CUUUUMMMM!!!!!&quot; dominates his poor addled brain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaaahhhh!!! It&#39;s stuck! It won&#39;t come out!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He tries moaning, but is unable to make the tiniest of sounds. He tries grimacing, but his face and silence always remaining a betrayal of how he felt. Not even the slightest little moan will ever be produced, much less escape past his stone lips that forever remain sealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, uuugh, uuuuuggghhh hheee hheell Hhheeeeeellpppp!!!!&quot; his silent pleas go unanswered <br />
<br />
But now the drop in temperature was so severe as a rainy cold front is blowing through, that it even caught his highly distracted attention. His feet and everything else on his body became COLD! <br />
It was already cold to begin with. But this was practically freezing. He needed a nice fire. And now! But it was DARK, and he was unable to budge from his little spot!<br />
<br />
Then he felt it: a raindrop that managed to get between the tree leaves that over hangs him and his little pond. Then he heard it before he felt it: a downpour!<br />
<br />
He wanted desparately to take shelter. To go into a nice warm house with warm glowing electric light. To take a hot shower. He&#39;ll be taking a shower, alright. But of the cold variety! His first of many that would allow mold and miss to grow, particularly on his cute little right cheek where a bit of sunlight would hit at certain hours of the day.<br />
<br />
The rain began to beat down upon him. No way to avoid it. He became so wet, drops would drop off of him. And still he stands there, forced to motionlessly gaze down at his 11 year old statuefied body. Even his eyeballs utterly locked in place. Always looking at the exact same spot. <br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back at his house, the boy that took over his body, began to take over his life. The chronivac &quot;disappeared&quot; of its own accord, after finishing off its owner. The new Jeff had no idea what happened, and his old life would fade from his mind as Jeff&#39;s life and old memories before the chronivac would take over. <br />
<br />
You see, the boy who switched bodies with Jeff, had no part in programming the transformation. And so, the machine made make it where his life would be &quot;normal.&quot; The new Jeff would acquire all of Jeff&#39;s skills and athletic abilities. He would go on to a four year college with a full-time baseball scholarship, then onto professional baseball. He&#39;d eventually make it into an MLB roster, and become a regular starter for two decades. A life that the real Jeff should have had. Instead, he has the life of a cold, stone statue of an adorable little 11year old boy. A 16 year old mind forever trapped.<br />
<br />
As for poor Jeff, the body of the boy he switched with just before becoming a smaller cuter boy of the same age, would go &quot;missing.&quot; That boy&#39;s parents would never know what happened to their son. They would search for him, but would never find him. Unaware that the statue in their little back garden was once their son who switched bodies with a 16 year old baseball star. A baseball star destined for greatness and wealth. <br />
<br />
Jeff himself forever cursed with the knowledge of all he had lost. Nobody would know him as a person. Nobody would ever speak to him, hug him, or lay with him. He would never father any children. He would just remain stuck on this small piece of the backyard of this property. <br />
<br />
The property would change hands over the years. People and their families would come, grow up, move out, and the couple growing old. Then the adult children would come back to sell the property to a new young family. <br />
<br />
Everyone else all have lives they will live. They&#39;ll do things, and then they&#39;ll retire then die. Everyone Jeff ever knew would one day be dead. None of them with any idea he had turned into a statue of a horny 11 year old boy. And Jeff would just continue standing there, staring at his little statue of a body. His immobile stone mask of a face staring back calmly from the surface of his little pond.</p>
