<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had babysat for Dr. Jenkins before and Joey was a handful! He never went to bed when you told him and he always talked back, always asking why and arguing every point for the sake of it. Makes it sound like I don&#39;t like the kid but I do, he&#39;s frustrating but he makes me laugh as well.<br />
<br />
Tonight I was expected to sit for Joey overnight, Dr. Jenkins and his wife were going to stop over in a hotel after a gala so tonight was worth 200 quid! Well worth missing out on hanging out with my mates in the park on a Friday night with cheap beer one of the had managed to get their older brother to buy for us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Michael please remember to keep Joey out of the basement, I have very sensitive experiments down there and he&#39;s liable to hurt himself.&quot; Dr. Jenkins repeated for the fourth time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will Dr. Jenkins, don&#39;t worry, you and Mrs. Jenkins can relax we&#39;ll be fine isn&#39;t that right Joey?&quot; I looked down at the 8 year old and ruffled his hair. He hated that and glared back up at me silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK then, well there is cash on the side for Pizza and there is ice cream in the freezer and plenty of squash in the fridge... now where are my keys.&quot; Dr. Jenkins was a genius apparently working on many different projects for the government but he was extremely forgetful and a bit clumsy. After another 10 minutes we were waving them off before heading back inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going on my games!&quot; Joey shouted and ran off. I had my homework to do so went into the kitchen and began on some maths I had been putting off since Monday.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d been so engrossed trying to solve my simultaneous equations I hadn&#39;t noticed Joey had snuck into the basement. I rushed down as soon as I heard the smashing of glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey! What are you doing?!&quot; As I reached the bottom of the stairs I saw the door had been unlocked and Joey stood there frozen in fear looking at a shattered beaker on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Michael! I&#39;m sorry I was just looking! I promise!&quot; He was shaking a little but it was just a beaker, no harm done really.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh,&quot; I bent down to him and held him by the arms. &quot;it&#39;s OK buddy, it&#39;s just a beaker, bet your dad has hundreds! You go back and play your games and I&#39;ll clean this up and we can order the pizza?&quot; Joey wiped a tear from his cheek and smiled at me nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pepperoni and pineapple!&quot; He cheered as he ran back upstairs. I laughed to myself, thinking he&#39;s a good kid really, who wouldn&#39;t want to nose around their dad&#39;s lab. I picked up a broom and swept the glass onto some card and put it in the glass bin. As I went to leave something shiny caught my eye... a bottle with a silver label was sat in the centre of a desk of papers. I walked over to it and read the label.<br />
<br />
MG97 - Batch 421, looking at the papers on the desk I noticed a sheet labelled the same. Taking both for some reason I headed back upstairs and back into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pizza!&quot; Was all I heard from the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ordering now buddy!&quot; I called back and rang the pizza place. After that was sorted (double pepperoni, double pineapple, I was feeling generous) I sat back at the kitchen table and read the paperwork.<br />
<br />
MG97... enchanced muscle growth... phallic enlargement... almost instant reaction... 10ml dosage...<br />
<br />
I&#39;d been engrossed in the text next thing I heard was the doorbell. I took the pizza into the kitchen and set it out on plates. I don&#39;t know why I did what I did but... I took a teaspoon out and poured some of the liquid sparingly onto one of the plates of pizza, put the teaspoon in the sink and called Joey in...<br />
<br />
He was in his pyjamas already and jumped up at the table pulling a plate to him he began to eat his pizza with gusto! It was then I realised which plate he&#39;d taken!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm pineapple, tastes really sweet...&quot; He said smiling at me with a mouthful on show. I laughed, partly because it was cute, partly because I was in shock... what had I done?!<br />
<br />
Joey polished off every bite, I had eaten just one slice by the time he&#39;d finished. &quot;Mmmmmmm that was awesome Michael!&quot; He jumped down off the stool and made a thud, much heavier sounding than I expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ok Joey?&quot; I asked looking him up and down. He stood there all 4 foot 2 inches, weighing no more than 50 pounds, blue eyes, smooth slightly tan skin, sandy brown hair and smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea why? I feel really good actually.&quot; His pj&#39;s looked a little tight... like they were a couple of years too small for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You been working out Joey?&quot; I laughed trying to see if it was having any effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Course not why?&quot; Joey looked at himself then and I could see it in his movements, he was wondering now why his pjs felt tight. He flexed one arm and I saw a ball of muscle appear. &quot;What... Michael look!&quot; He poked the muscle with his other hand and it looked hard, very hard. As he poked it more a button popped open on his shirt. &quot;Look!&quot; He shouted excitedly and in one moevement he grabbed his shirt by the centre and pulled it clean off, it ripped in two and fluttered to the ground... There stood an 8 year old boy with pecs and abs, biceps that bulged out as his arms moved and rounded soulders striated with muscle. I just sat there with my mouth open and my cock rock hard in my jeans! He began flexing his arms and stroking his chest giggling to himself.<br />
<br />
A second later I heard another pop and the button on his pj bottoms popped off, Joey looked down and saw a bulge... I looked down and nearly came!</p>
