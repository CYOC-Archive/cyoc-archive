<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack slowly started to stir. Steve&#39;s strong grasp tightened around the little man as struggled to get out. With a burst of energy Jack was able to escape the grasp. <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning...&quot; Steven yawned. His arms and legs stretched out well past the bed on either end. <br />
<br />
However, it was taking Jack a few seconds to fully take in what he was seeing. The massive jock seemed so much bigger this close and personal. Nor did he realize just how much golden hair covered his body. Did Steven always have a beard? Then there was the nudity. Jack&#39;s eyes hung on the massive rod waking up faster than the person attached to it. He swallowed hard as Steven splayed himself out on the small dorm room bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-morning...&quot; Jack uttered out. The sexual haze he&#39;d been through the night before was completely gone. Only flashes of the night were still in his mind. Once some of them came to light, he rushed over to a mirror. His hands went to his ears only to find them mostly human shaped again. A bit of a point cropped the top of them, but nothing anyone who wasn&#39;t looking for it would notice. It was the same with his back side. Even though there wasn&#39;t a tail poking out there, he still almost felt like his spine was ever so slightly longer.<br />
<br />
Steven&#39;s large body draped itself over Jack&#39;s. &quot;Just seeing how cute you are?&quot; he smirked, adding a few kisses to the small man&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
Jack squirmed under the pressure. His little body wriggled in the other man&#39;s grasp. The massive arms had to be at least twice the size of his and the amount of power within them was more than his entire body could produce. It didn&#39;t help that the thick prickly golden brown beard tickled his necks as Steven continued to kiss it. For a moment, Jack leaned into it. It felt good. Everything that he would have ever wanted. But something also felt wrong.<br />
<br />
Jack pulled himself away and kept the little distance he could away from Steven. &quot;What happened last night,&quot; he panted. His eyes were struggling to maintain eye contact but he did the best he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Steven shrugged his heavy shoulders and gave a cocky laugh. &quot;I met you in your room and gave you a blow job. Then we were going back to my place when I finger fucked you. Then you crawled up into my bed and we went to sleep,&quot; he explained. &quot;Oh. Yeah. And you shit out a bunch of eggs.&quot; He nodded towards a bag. &quot;I put them all in there.&quot; A red drawstring backpack laid near a nightstand. Jack eyed it suspiciously. &quot;Go on,&quot; Steven encouraged. &quot;Count them if you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack picked up the bag and could confirm that there were eggs in it. &quot;Okay...&quot; he jostled the bag around feeling the eggs roll around inside. &quot;I guess that&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. And then we&#39;ll just leave them in here. My dormmate won&#39;t be back until Monday,&quot; Steven said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! What?&quot; Jack clung to the bag tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Steven stayed calm. His large body leaned forward, breaking the little distance between the two. &quot;It&#39;s the safest way, right? You need to keep them hidden. The only person coming in and out of my room will be me. And do you think anyone&#39;s going to test me?&quot; He flexed his massively muscular body.<br />
<br />
Jack felt the blood rushing away from his brain. &quot;N-no...&quot; he shook his head as gawked. Even though there was a strange nagging feeling in the back of his brain, he couldn&#39;t help but loosen his grip. A deep feeling of trust in the jock he barely knew felt like it&#39;d formed between in him. &quot;I guess that makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Steven put the backpack back where it had been. &quot;Let&#39;s get ready for class.&quot; He went to his dresser and pulled out a super charged cotton shirt that must have been at least a size too small for him. Even though it normally clung to his chest and arms, this shirt looked almost to be straining already. Steven didn&#39;t pay it any mind as he pulled up a pair of boxers and some soft fabric shorts. &quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Jack a few whole seconds to realize what Steven had just said. &quot;Wait! CLASS!?&quot; he shouted. &quot;I-I-I can&#39;t go like this! All my clothes smell like sweat and sex!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Steven pretended to care. He put a finger under his chin and thought about it. Then went to his dresser. He pulled out several shirts until he found one. &quot;How about this? It&#39;s probably still a little big, but it fit me pretty well in high school.&quot; Then pulled out some shorts. &quot;These will be big too, but the draw string should hold them up.&quot; He tossed them at Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sure...&quot; Jack struggled to catch them. &quot;I&#39;ll go change...&quot; He went for the bathroom to only feel a hard slap to his rear. The sound of it echoed in the room. Jack jumped high and then looked back up at Steven. The confident smirk the other man gave sent him for a loop. His face burned red and buried into the clothes he was wearing. The smell of Steven&#39;s sweat filled his nose and he almost let out a moan. Jack rushed into the bathroom trying his best not to make too much of a scene.<br />
<br />
Jack did his best to maintain his composure. He tried to push his throbbing member down. It didn&#39;t help at all. Even worse, this had been one of his fantasies. Jack had always wanted to wear someone like Steven&#39;s clothes and feel against his body. When he pulled the shirt down over his body, he couldn&#39;t believe how big it looked on him. Jack was used to wearing mediums, but this large draped down past his butt. The shorts were just as big and baggy, though the drawstring was able to hold them up around his waist.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Steven was feeling something similar. Even if it&#39;d only been 24 hours since he&#39;d ever thought of Jack sexually, he couldn&#39;t deny the connection between them. Something was pulling them together and it seemed to have something to do with those eggs. &#39;Perfect...&#39; Steven smirked. His hormones were raging and if he saw that nude body again, he didn&#39;t know if he&#39;d be able to stop himself again. Even just the smell of the little man made him go wild. And now his own scent would be mixing in with it. Steven wanted more but this would have to do for now. <br />
<br />
With Jack in the other room, Steven took his chance to grab four eggs out of the string backpack and put them into his pockets. With his keys and wallet, it was hard to really tell anything in them was amiss. &quot;Ready?&quot; Steven knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-ready,&quot; Jack answered as he exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Steven&#39;s arm wrapped around Jack&#39;s body and pulled the small man in. Without a single hint of embarrassment, the two walked together to their class.</p>
