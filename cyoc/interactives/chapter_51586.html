<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You slowly woke up and saw Maggie sitting on the bed smiling at you. You looked at Maggie with fear in your eyes and scooted up toward the headboard a bit. &quot;It's ok punkin,&quot; Maggie said in a soft voice. &quot;I'm not mad at you. I should have been paying more attention to you. I'll be a better mother now though. Amy and Jack will be so pleased to see you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok Maggie?&quot; you asked losing some of your fear.<br />
<br />
Maggie smiled and said, &quot;I'm just fine now that you're back punkin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just that you seem to think I'm a girl,&quot; you said trying to handle this as best you can.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think you're a girl,&quot; Maggie said and giggled a little. &quot;I know you're a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had started relaxing a bit but when she said she knew you were a girl you tensed up again. She was crazy and you were her prisoner. You looked toward the door wondering if she left it unlocked. Maybe you can get to it if you distract Maggie so you asked, &quot;How come you locked me in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I didn't want to lose you again punkin,&quot; Maggie said. &quot;And in case you're wondering the door is locked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you holding me prisoner?&quot; you nearly shout whipping your head to look at Maggie. You realized the error of your question and how you asked it too late. You prepared yourself for her to go crazy and kill you.<br />
<br />
Instead Maggie sighed and said, &quot;I'm not holding you prisoner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like it to me,&quot; you muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I should tell you what's happening,&quot; Maggie said seeming to have heard you. &quot;I told you yesterday that my youngest died. Do you remember that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes,&quot; you said. &quot;But what does that have to do with you keeping me prisoner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be patient and I'll tell you punkin,&quot; Maggie said. &quot;Now I didn't exactly tell you the truth. My youngest got lost and we couldn't find her. After a month of looking everyone told me that there was no way she could still be alive so we had a funeral for her. But I wanted her body to be found so it could be put to rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must have been horrible for you,&quot; you said feeling sympathy for Maggie. &quot;I still don't see what that has to do with you keeping me prisoner though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm a witch,&quot; Maggie said with a smile. &quot;And over the years I kept using my magic to try and find her body with no success. I couldn't understand why I wasn't able to find her body. I believed that she was dead since it did seem like she couldn't survive by herself. Then a couple days ago I had an idea. If I couldn't find her body then she must be alive. I knew that if she was still alive she would be old enough to come to me. So I started using my magic to call to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see what that has to do with me,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You took a little nap someplace and when you woke you were here weren't you?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
You thought about how you had gone to sleep on the grassy path and woke up on the farm. &quot;How did you know that?&quot; you asked starting to think that you were going crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know punkin,&quot; Maggie said picking up the dress she had brought in earlier. &quot;Humor me for a moment. Take this dress and hold it up to you. It won't fit you yet but you'll see why I ask this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were a little apprehensive but you did as asked. When you held it up it seemed bigger than it was earlier. That wasn't what was so strange though. You suddenly had a vision. It was of the farm and it looked to be in better shape. The view shifted to look at the ground and you saw this same dress and the black sandals. There were feet in the sandals. It seemed like you were looking through the eyes of the girl who wore this dress. But that was impossible. You heard a woman call out, &quot;MARY. TIME FOR DINNER.&quot; The view looked up and it looked like the girl ran to the farmhouse. Once inside and at the table a woman set a plate down in front of the girl and said, &quot;There you go punkin. Eat up.&quot; You suddenly placed the voice as being Maggie's. You remember seeing a few pictures of Maggie and her children and you recognize the woman as being a younger Maggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you remember something punkin,&quot; Maggie said bringing you back to the here and now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; you asked shaking your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
You know what it looked like but it couldn't be. &quot;I can't be Mary Maggie,&quot; you said putting a hand on her's.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are,&quot; Maggie said. &quot;I hope that once you're completely back that you'll be able to tell me how you wound up in that body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I've been male all my life,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that were true then you would not be changing,&quot; Maggie said. &quot;See for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at your body. You had forgotten that you had gone back to sleep without covering up. Now you can plainly see your penis. Or what was left of it. It had shrunk down to little more than a nub and your nuts couldn't be seen. &quot;How?&quot; you asked yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're also shorter and your hair is longer,&quot; Maggie said.<br />
<br />
You realized that she was right. There was only one thing that could be happening impossible as it may seem. You were turning into a little girl.</p>
