<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gen felt helpless as she was once again stuck in a door. Will anyone come help her? Or will she be stuck here for good? Will someone other then Jamal discover her and call 911?<br />
<br />
To think that her simple life could be turned upside down in the span of one day. First it was yelling at her friends for the first time... Then is was meeting Jamal and receiving these unnatural powers... And then, just a few minutes ago, Craicy started acting strangely...<br />
<br />
...........<br />
<br />
A few minutes ago...<br />
<br />
............<br />
<br />
Before Gen is to go into the storage room to grab some dodge balls, she was told to change into her gym clothes first.<br />
<br />
	As Gen entered the Girl&#39;s locker room, she noticed that she wasn&#39;t alone. Since class has already started, the locker room should be empty. Unfortunately, Gen wasn&#39;t the only girl who was late. As Gen walked in to the bathroom area to get changed into her PE cloths, she immediacy recognized the girl taking her time brushing her hair in front of the mirror. Her name is Craicy, the twin sister to Craig. And just like how Craig is a bully to Jamal, Criacy is a bitch to Gen. Craicy is the school&#39;s top cheer leader. She&#39;s probably one of the most beautiful and athletic girl is school. Unfortunately for Gen, Craicy views Gen as more beautiful and lucky then her. It does&#39;t help that she doesn&#39;t really know anyone other then her brother very well. She doesn&#39;t have anyone she considers a friend, and as a result she grew envious of Gen and how she managed to attract and keep good relationships with many friends. Craicy is not very social compared to Gen and they both knows it. As a result, Craicy takes every opportunity she gets to ruin Gen&#39;s life. She not very successful however thanks to Gen&#39;s powerful circle of friends. But that doesn&#39;t mean Craicy can&#39;t be salty about it.<br />
<br />
Craicy rolled her eyes in disdain as Gen walked into the room. &quot;So the &#39;Angel&#39; is finally late for class. Finally gave in to the pressures of life? What happened to your so-called friends? Did they finally gave up on holding your hand?&quot; She asked tauntingly.<br />
<br />
Craicy made it sound like it wasn&#39;t Gen&#39;s choice to be away from her friends. Gan opted to give her the honest answer. &quot;I think friends are great! But even friends needs a break every once in a while. I barley have any time alone.... Sometimes I just need space to think. I explained that to them and they let me go. They were really nice about it!&quot; Get replied honestly.<br />
<br />
Craicy looked away disdainfully. &quot;Oh really? Well, I supposed everyone needs some space every so often.... I&#39;m just surprised it took you years to figure that out.&quot; <br />
<br />
For a few minutes, Craicy just brushed her hair in silence. <br />
<br />
Not having anything to say, Gen just went to a isolated corner and changed into her gym clothes. She made extra care not to fuse with any of her clothes. She&#39;s not ready for someone like Craicy finding out about her new power.<br />
<br />
But Gen could help but feel strange about the whole situation. And it wasn&#39;t just her new fusion powers making her feel strange. Usually, Craicy is a lot more mean spirited and in your face. One time, Craicy went into Gen&#39;s locker and swap her clothes with Craig&#39;s old, stinky gym cloths. But despite the obvious attempt at sabotage, Gen just forgave her and asked for her clothes back. And for some reason, that just made Craicy even more angry.<br />
<br />
But this time... Craicy seemed so quiet. It&#39;s almost like she&#39;s stopping her self from getting into a fight with her. In fact... She just seemed sad today. <br />
<br />
Gen could tell something was wrong because Craicy, her # 1 bully, actually gave her space without much resistance. <br />
<br />
Every time Gen forgave her, it was simply because she took pity of her. She understood that Craicy was simply venting on her. And she accepted it.<br />
<br />
But this time... It felt like Craicy was defeated.<br />
<br />
When Gen came back to the locker room bathroom, she noticed Craicy still brushing her hair in front of a mirror. She had a far off look in her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Craicy, we need to talk.&quot; Gen stated.<br />
<br />
Craicy didn&#39;t even bother looking towards her. <br />
<br />
This is bad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look. I understand that all humans are born with different lives. So I couldn&#39;t possibly fully understand what&#39;s happening in your life. But You&#39;re not usually this quiet. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Craicy just looked back at Gen coolly. &quot;Maybe I just don&#39;t have the energy to knock some sense into you today. You seem to be a doing a good job at that by yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the first time... Craicy annoyed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not pushing them away! Like I said, I just needed a change of pace!&quot; Gan exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And have you figured out yet that maybe I need a change of pace too!&quot; Craicy snapped. <br />
<br />
That snapped Gen into silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Look. You&#39;re not the only one who needs a break. If you have any kind of respect for me, then you would leave me alone just this once. Don&#39;t even bother trying to apologize. I&#39;m sick of that crap. Just.... please. Leave me alone.&quot; She said almost somberly. <br />
<br />
Instead of explaining how she understood Craicy&#39;s plight, Gen respected her wishes and just simply nodded.<br />
<br />
Gen just walked out of the locker room and didn&#39;t look back. On her way out, she could hear Craicy crying.<br />
<br />
She can&#39;t hold back the feeling that she is making a horrible mistake... Her mind kept telling her to turn back and comfort her bully.... But her body wouldn&#39;t stop walking.<br />
<br />
............<br />
<br />
Gen couldn&#39;t help but feel horrible. She somehow made Craicy, someone who been trying to sabotage her for a long time... cry. <br />
<br />
Maybe she really is turning into a monster? All in one day, so many things has changed for her. <br />
<br />
She kept telling everyone that she took a break from her friends peacfully. But in reality, all of them has been getting in her face lately. They&#39;ve been demanding so many things from her without considering her feelings. She knows they mean well, but she was emotionally exhausted. So eventually, it took her shouting at her friends to get them to stop. Right after her out burst, she explained her point of view and asked her friends to give her a break for a day. They may overbearing, but they are also understanding. So ever since this morning, they been leaving her alone. But Gen couldn&#39;t help but feel bad about what she done. She never shouted at a friend like that! And to think  that she would receive such strange powers afterwards...<br />
<br />
She need to get out off this door. But she can&#39;t call Jamal with her phone. And even if she could call her, he probably won&#39;t be able to come until after school. He might look suspicious if he suddenly goes into the storage room in the middle of class. <br />
<br />
She&#39;ll have get out of this mess by herself. Maybe this strange power has a fail-safe that prevents the user from getting stuck?<br />
<br />
Instinctively, Gen tried to move out the door. Surprisingly, with a loud *FWOOMPH!*, she was out.<br />
<br />
Gen was once again human and still in the storage room<br />
<br />
For the next few moments, Gen checked to make sure she was completely normal. Once she got her bearings, she contemplated what to do next.<br />
<br />
Now that she is free, she should go back before the class period ends. She doesn&#39;t want to risk her perfect attendance.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand... She couldn&#39;t help but feel curious...<br />
<br />
It may have been during unfavorable situation, but being fused with something... Kinda felt nice.<br />
<br />
Gen walked up to a couple of unoccupied volley balls on the floor. She feels... experimental. She hopes that Jamal wasn&#39;t rubbing off on her.<br />
<br />
Her coach just checked the storage room... so chances are that no one would be going into the storage room until at least the end of the class period. So she has a few minutes at most.<br />
<br />
She carefully removed her shirt and dropped it to the ground. She then picked up the two volley balls... and reluctantly pressed them against her breasts...<br />
<br />
FWOOMPH!<br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, her breasts felt... light. Maybe it&#39;s because of the air in the volley balls? It&#39;s strange to have huge but very light breasts. Her back doesn&#39;t feel that much strain anymore.<br />
<br />
Gen tenderly touched her breasts, only to jerk her hands away. They felt so... sensitive!<br />
<br />
Gen touched her breasts more slowly this time and was amazed by how she could FEEL her firm volley ball texture! <br />
<br />
But she can continue experimenting with her powers later. She&#39;s in the middle of class and she doesn&#39;t want to risk anyone discovering her powers. She&#39;ll just have to experiment more when she gets home.<br />
<br />
But before she could remove her volley ball breasts and return to class, she heard a noise coming from the storage room door!</p>
