<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Depth of sensation was hers to enjoy, Tina had not yet been with a real man, only some young, bold lovers; but this fellow was a true stud. Unknown that Jeff being then in a wholly different form, Tina was enjoying her sex mate almost as much as he seemed to be enjoying her. Had she known the dog was her brother in a different form, she might have thought about it before consenting. <br />
<br />
Certainly not a true case of incest, she having made love with a dog, while it rutted his cock working it around inside of her, he had reached as far as his limits and boner would allow. Huffing sire and moaning bitch, Tina tried to rationalize her act as still something common if not wholesome.<br />
<br />
Rolling around on the floor, the male dog was thrusting so hard, he was pushing Tina across her bedroom floor. She liked how the big dog tried to squirm as he thrust, as if he had never done this before and wanted as much sensation as his cock could find.<br />
<br />
Moaning, Tina groaned at the horrid thought of her brother coming home and finding her molested by a dog. A dog…, they did not have a dog, their mother would never allow them to have any pets. Then from where did the big dog come from, she thought about this, and suddenly remembered that when she came home Jeff was in his bedroom toying with his computer.<br />
<br />
“Huh, oh, oh, yes please doggy do that again,” Tina moaning from her wealth of sensation, she then heard a door slam, it might be the breeze, or it might be Jeff?<br />
<br />
Horrified at the likelihood it was Jeff coming into the house, Tina tried pushing her stud off, if he would or could pull out. Thrashing around on the bedroom floor, Tina was at her wits ends trying to urge the dog to pull back and him step off from her. She pushed and he pushed as thrust back even harder, Tina moaning then quite loud slapped her hand over her mouth for fear Jeff had heard her moaning.<br />
<br />
“Oh, oh, oh if Jeff came in here right now he would…” Tina groaned, and as she said the name of Jeff aloud, he who was her brother gained a sudden surge of remembrance of how he got there and of what he was doing, he doing his sister.<br />
<br />
“Woof, err, woof,” as Jeff looked down, he twisting his head and neck to crane down and back seeing his penis as huge, red, dog like, and he remembering how he had requested the silly computer game he was playing to make of him a Doberman stud sire male dog. He was a dog, and humped mission style over the front of his older sister, she seemingly liking what he was doing, and her!<br />
<br />
Realizing his presence of self and the situation, Jeff began doing as Tina wished, but try as he did; his cock and its knot held him inside Tina, stuck and stuck tightly.<br />
<br />
A few deep inhaled breaths and Jeff began to feel his cock knot softening. As he held a wary pose over his sister and still stuck together, she laid there mumbling abut if Jeff saw her, she would be so humiliated.<br />
<br />
“Yeff, yeff, ah woof, eee, yeffa,” Jeff struggled to get out his name in as coherent a manner as was possible considering the shape of his mouth and his having a longer tongue.<br />
<br />
Tina seemed to grasp his effort at speaking; she had big, wide eyes looking up at the large dog. “No, no it is not possible; my brother is not a dog and did not just do me…?” Tina muttered, and to this her brother barked as if he were happy she knew the truth.<br />
<br />
The slow slithering release of the cock from inside of Tina had her leap up, groan, and then hobble to the bedroom of her brother Jeff. There was his computer, the screen-saver having come on, she moved the mouse and up came the red lettered warning.<br />
<br />
The choice of what Jeff asked to become was still there as part of the on-screen information. The one big warning sign told of a programing error, and that all changes, were then permanent. Tina reading the information on screen, she looked at the dog standing there, and asked it, &quot;Are you my dumb brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
An instant and loud, indignant sort of a reply came from the dog, as if Jeff did not appreciated his sister referring to him as being dumb, and not to make mention of him becoming as a dog.<br />
<br />
Jeff knew then his sister held his life and future in her hands, she knew this too, and sitting there she began to toy with the computer, returning the program running to the home page as if to begin something for it to do to her. Feeling a sense of affection and wishing to show it as best he could, Jeff reached his snout into the crotch of his sister and began licking the leaking semen from her lusty lips.<br />
<br />
Strange to them both but Tina did not push the dog away, but liking the feeling, she was willing to let the dog brother do her by tongue or in other ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we do not alert mom, and tonight we can do it again, you on me and I on my bed, just as before?&quot;</p>
