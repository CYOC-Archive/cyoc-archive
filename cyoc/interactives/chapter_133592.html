<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paige was surprised was to see Sarah, Zane’s younger sister casually step down the staircase and enter the basement. As she walked over to her the baby girl quickly got to her feet and stood up straight as the woman walked over to her, the adult towering over her and making her suddenly feel self-conscious about being a one year old in a dirty diaper.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the woman Paige saw that Sarah hadn’t changed one bit since she last saw her. She was still looking incredibly beautiful considering she had just turned thirty what with her blue eyes, long blonde hair that hung just past her shoulders and curvy body with decent sized breasts which showed through her t-shirt quite well. Aside from that she also was wearing a pair of dark blue jeans and tennis shoes. Sarah was so hot looking and had a wonderful personality that she had always wondered why she hadn’t found a guy yet and was still single.<br />
<br />
Realizing she was getting distracted Paige returned to the topic at hand.<br />
<br />
“Sarah…what are you doing here?” she asked wondering what her sister-in-law was doing here.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t you read the note Zane left you? I’m the caretaker he asked to come and take care of you” Sarah explained to the young girl.<br />
<br />
“He asked you to do that?”<br />
<br />
Paige didn’t mean for it to come out sounding so surprised as she liked her sister in <br />
<br />
“Yeah, family should take care of family am I right?” Sarah before placing her hands on her hips, “Anyway it’s about time you stumbled across the Youth Booth, for the past week I’ve been sitting at home waiting for you to find it and I was this close to just calling you up and telling you to go down to the basement and check out the booth” she said putting her two fingers together for emphasis.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, it’s just getting over what happened to Zane took a while” Paige replied sadly.<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize, I understand as it took me a while to get over his death too” she agreed before kneeling down so she was eye level with the toddler, “Though I gotta say you look cute and adorable as a baby Paige especially with that diaper. Though I already knew that since Zane showed me your baby pictures” Sarah admitted causing the girl to blush a little, both at the compliment and the fact she had seen those pictures of her in her younger days some of which were a bit embarrassing.<br />
<br />
“Speaking of diapers, it smells like you could use a fresh one right about now” she commented bringing attention to the horrible odor rising up from her backside.<br />
<br />
Paige’s blush deepened when the other reached back with her hand and felt the seat of her padding, feeling the large lump of poo back there.<br />
<br />
“Wow, seems like you sure filled your diaper up nice and good for your first messing” Sarah grinned as she looked at the red-faced toddler, “So did you like making poo poo in your Pampers Paige?” she asked as Paige stared back and awkwardly nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh”<br />
<br />
“I bet you did. Don’t worry Zane told me all about your secret fetish which is why I volunteered because I loved the idea of taking care of you as a baby” Sarah said as she wrapped her arms around the baby girl and gave her a warm hug. As she pulled away she gave Paige a quick kiss on the forehead, “And also because I love you very much.”<br />
<br />
Paige smiled at the thought of Sarah being her mommy, already warming up to the idea and wanting to quickly make it a reality.<br />
<br />
And what better way then by reminding her of a certain ‘duty’ she needed to take care of, both figuratively and literally.<br />
<br />
“Sarah, I need changing” she said innocently while fingering her lip cutely and swaying side to side.<br />
<br />
“Quite right” Sarah agreed reaching down and picking up the smelly one year old by her armpits, lifting her over her shoulder and holding her back with one hand and hooking her other arms under her knees. All this to avoid squishing the contents of the toddler’s dirty Pamper which she figured the other wouldn’t enjoy too much. Paige then cutely wrapped her arms around her necks for additional support.<br />
<br />
“Come on you little stinker, time you get a new diaper.”<br />
<br />
As they climbed the staircase she took advantage of the fact the girl’s head was nestled into the crook of her neck, so close to her mouth. “It must have felt really good going potty in your pants just like a baby” she lightly whispered into Paige’s ear as she carried her out of the basement and back into the house.<br />
<br />
Closing the door behind her Sarah headed straight for the kitchen, quickly passing through and snatching up a large plastic bag from the island before going into the living room. Dropping the bag nearby on the floor she gently laid Paige down on the couch cushions on her back while simultaneously getting on her knees. Reaching into the bag she pulled out a plastic changing which she unfolded and slipped under the girl’s bottom. As Sarah pulled out the container of baby wipes and the bottle of baby powder she eyed the light brown spot on the seat of the diaper. <br />
<br />
“Okay, let’s see what we got here” Sarah mused as she ripped the adhesive tapes free and opened up the Pamper, the front coming down to reveal an enormous dark brown turd the size of a cigar lying in the seat. Paige lifted up her head so she could take a look for herself and smiled at the sight, feeling proud of the huge poo that had come out of her butt. Also with the opening of the padding the stench had increased but neither one of them was particularly bother by it at his point. Paige had already grown accustomed to the scent of her own poop having spent half an hour smelling it. “Wow Paige, let me just say that if there was a baby Olympics you would definitely win brown in the diaper pooping event with this number two” Sarah praised the baby causing Paige to laugh a little at the joke. She then watched as her ‘mommy’ raised her legs and pulled out her dirty diaper, dragging it off to the side and leaving it lying there on the couch cushion.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh, looks like someone’s hiney is tinky poo” Sarah said with a grin as she observed the brown stains on the baby girl’s butt cheeks. Her babyish statement caused the toddler girl to giggle and kick her legs a little. Grabbing a few moist wipes from the container and began to gently wipe her bottom, Paige squirming around in delight at the sensation of another person cleaning her poo covered rear. She ended up letting out a squeal as Sarah dragged the baby wipe between her butt crack. After getting it all she grabbed one more wipe and ran it over the whole area for good measure, even quickly doing the toddler’s smooth hairless crotch. Gathering up the soiled wipes she disposed of them by dropping them inside the open poopy Pamper before closing it up.<br />
<br />
Once Paige’s old used underwear was wrapped up and sealed Sarah reached into the bag and removed a small sealed package of size 6 Pampers Cruisers 18 count diapers.<br />
<br />
“I picked these up on the way here. These should hold us until I can get a larger supply” she remarked as she tore open the plastic and pulled out one of the folded plastic garments inside.<br />
<br />
However Paige wasn’t paying attention instead staring at the picture of the happy baby on the side of the packaging, a perfect reflection of what she now was. She barely even noticed as Sarah unfolded the new diaper, lifted her bottom slightly and slipped the back underneath before lowering her tush onto the soft padding. Leaving the Pamper open for a moment she reached for the final changing item, the bottle of powder.<br />
<br />
“And now some baby powder for my baby girl” Sarah said returning the toddler’s focus back to her just in time to she her sprinkle her crotch and bottom with the white sweet-smelling powder.<br />
<br />
Once she finished she reached down and grabbed the front of the padding, pulling it up snugly between the little girl’s legs. Holding it in place she used her other hand to take the wing like flaps, stretching them around the baby’s waist before taping them in place and securing the diaper in place.<br />
<br />
“There we go, all done!” Sarah said giving her a pat on the butt as the change came to an end.<br />
<br />
“Yea, I got a new diapy!” Paige exclaimed as she got off the couch and began to run around the room in excitement, enjoying her crinkly underwear.<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled at the adult toddler’s antics as she stood up and grabbed the old diaper from the couch. She then disappeared into the kitchen for a few seconds where she threw it away in the trash can and promptly returned to the living room. Sitting down she watched with amusement as Paige toddled about the space in just her padding.<br />
<br />
Eventually the one year old ran out of energy and waddled back over to Sarah who picked up the baby girl and set her down on her lap.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying being a baby again?” Sarah comment with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, now that I am one I just feel so free…like I have nothing to worry about anymore” Paige replied with a carefree grin, “This is all so new and exciting, I can’t wait to experience all the joys of babyhood, getting fed in a highchair, sucking on a pacifier, sleeping in a crib, drinking from a baby bottle” she listed off in excitement.<br />
<br />
“Pooping in your diapers…oh wait you already got that part down” she said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Paige playfully stuck out her tongue at the adult’s words before starting to suck her thumb.<br />
<br />
Despite the snarky remark she was proud of herself for going in her Pampers, having quickly adapted to her new role as a non-potty trained one year old. In fact she loved being dependent on the padding once again, already considering diapers to be the best part of being a baby. Now she could go potty whenever she wanted and the crinkly garment strapped to her waist would take care of her accident. Then Sarah would clean her up and put a new one on her, the thought bringing a smile to the young girl’s face.<br />
<br />
One thing Paige knew for certain was that she was going to definitely enjoy her return to her “diaper days” by using her new puffy underwear to the fullest.<br />
<br />
She grinned as Sarah was going to have a lot more changings to do in the future.</p>
