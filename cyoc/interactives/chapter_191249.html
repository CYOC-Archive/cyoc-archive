<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To the crocodile police woman’s further confusion Ty whispered something to his super busty naked girlfriend. They giggled conspiratorially and in a flash both of them were completely clothed and the rather slick mess in the back seat had vanished.<br />
<br />
The two humans stepped out of the car and June approached first, excitedly staring *up* over a foot and a half to the hulking reptile woman’s chin. The crocodile angled her snout down nervously and blinked at June, a concerned grimace passing over her long long mouth.<br />
<br />
“You’re so big!” June giggled, blushing.<br />
<br />
“Uh... thanks?” The Croc woman snorted.<br />
<br />
“So.” Ty sighed. “You want an explanation, huh?”<br />
<br />
The crocodile’s eye visibly twitched and she tensed her huge biceps over her now barely there breasts as she crossed her arms. She tapped her heavy leather boot impatiently. It thudded on the concrete ground of the car park. Her long heavy tail swayed lazily behind her, the sharp ridges clacking slightly with the movement. She noticed this, startled, and looked back momentarily. When her gaze returned to the much smaller human beings, she was clearly agitated and her eyes had narrow. She growled. “That would be a start.”<br />
<br />
“Easy.” Ty smirked. “Just relax. Get those strong new instincts under control.” He held out his hand and urged the croc woman to do the same. She gulped, almost in a slight haze, and unconsciously held out her own clawed hand. Ty felt a thrill as he touched the roughened scales of her palm and felt the sheer size and strength of her reptilian bulk. Thick veins and cords of muscle trailed up her massive forearm. He traced the lines gently and felt his huge prick starting to swell again.<br />
<br />
“Okay.” The crocodile sighed. She felt relief as her predatory rage subsided and cool emotions prevailed. “Now, can you please tell me what the fuck just happened to me?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Ty said agreeably. “I’d be glad to tell you over coffee and doughnuts.”<br />
<br />
“Very funny,” the croc rumbled, smirking at the edge of her long jaws. “But I’m on duty.”<br />
<br />
“Are you?” Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
“Charlie-6!” Her radio suddenly crackled.<br />
<br />
“G-Go ahead,” the cop keyed her mic, wide eyed.<br />
<br />
“Can you call the Sarge, please? It’s not urgent.”<br />
<br />
“Watch this,” Ty giggled.<br />
<br />
The huge croc woman pulled out her croc sized phone and tapped a number with her claws. It rang. The humans waited off to the side.<br />
<br />
“Sarge!”<br />
<br />
They couldn’t hear the other side.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah. Yeah, no. Just wrapping up a complaint. Uh-huh. Yep. Sure, sure. No, I understand. Yep. I’ll see you Monday, then. Thanks, Sarge.”<br />
<br />
The reptile woman now looked bewildered and put her phone away. She stared down at the humans and blinked several times. Silently. Just in awe.<br />
<br />
“So... I guess I get the rest of the week off with full pay? For... excellent work?”<br />
<br />
“Imagine that.” Ty said flatly. June giggled next to him and threw her arms around his waist.<br />
<br />
The croc blinked again, looked back at her car, and gulped. “Um, I have to go check in my car and stuff. You wanna meet me down at the Center Street Precinct?”<br />
<br />
“Sure!” Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
“Sure.” The crocodile blinked again and again, as she turned to her cop car and opened the door. She somehow crammed herself in, knocking her hat off and crunching into the seat, which she had to put back as far as it would go. Her knees nearly touched her chest.<br />
<br />
Cursing, she fired up the vehicle and drove off.<br />
<br />
“Shall we?”<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
The giant crocodile woman stepped into the precinct’s garage and expected screams and horror. Nobody even looked up.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Scales!” The old mechanic waved. “Don’t know what you did to get on the Sarge’s good side,  huh?”<br />
<br />
“Uh... hey, Roger!” The croc waved sheepishly, shrugging. “Me either.”<br />
<br />
The haggard old technician chuckled and whistled as he normally did.<br />
<br />
She walked toward the door. Scales? Hey usually called her by her nickname, but that was new. Wait... that was her nickname now? Uh, sure. Sure. She ducked under the door frame, shaking her head, and walked into the familiar hallway and the back offices. Nobody gave a shit that a massive crocodilian humanoid was in the station. People even waved casually, bustling with reports and phones and folders.<br />
<br />
She blinked and walked up the stairs to the locker room. She approached her familiar locker and found one of the other officers standing nearby putting his uniform on.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Scales, you done already?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah.” Officer Reynolds. Keith. Good guy, tough but fair. “I don’t know what the hell happened but I’ve got the next rotation off.”<br />
<br />
“No way!” Officer Reynolds laughed, buttoning his shirt. “That’s lucky! The ball breaker must be in a hell of a mood. You taking a vacation or something? Like you and the girl?”<br />
<br />
“Thinking about it.” She gulped, opening her locker and letting out a sigh of relief as she saw her familiar portrait of her young daughter, Max, who was still human. She began to put her things away, startled as literally every spare uniform she had had grown in size.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Reynolds smiled politely. “Enjoy it. You’ve really earned a break after that jumper.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, he didn’t jump.” The croc shrugged. “It turned out to be a good call.”<br />
<br />
“True! That’s why you get the rough ones, right?” Keith patted her back as he clicked her belt on and passed by. “Take care, scales! Enjoy your time off!”<br />
<br />
“Have a good one out there, Keith!”<br />
<br />
She let out an exasperated sigh and put the rest of gear away.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
The giant crocodile threw on her jean jacket that had been sunstantially smaller this morning and stepped out of the front doors to see the red SUV waiting. She shook her head and popped open the back doors, sliding under the roof and squeaking over the leather seat. All of it. She hunched over awkwardly.<br />
<br />
“Where to?” Ty smirked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Coffee and doughnuts.” The croc shrugged. “I don’t fucking know. Just start talking!”<br />
<br />
“Fine.” Ty drove away.<br />
<br />
The giant crocodile woman in the back seat listened intently as Ty unravelled the basic parts of the tale, minus June’s helpless domination and all the dirty parts. He also left out the bit where he was actually a 15 year old.<br />
<br />
At multiple points, the reptile woman looked bewildered and horrified, until finally Ty stopped and let her take it in.<br />
<br />
“So... okay, fine. Whatever. But like, why me?”<br />
<br />
“Because you were trying to take us to jail.” June shrugged.<br />
<br />
“No, I was going to give you a lecture and let you go.” The croc shrugged her huge broad shoulders, hitting the roof again. She cursed. “But anyway, that still doesn’t make any sense. Hey, we need to get rid of this cop! Let’s turn her into a fucking giant reptile woman. Yeah, sure, makes sense to me!”<br />
<br />
“I was just having fun.” Ty shrugged. “If you want me to turn you back I can like that.”<br />
<br />
“Uh...” The croc blinked. She blushed a little lighter on her cheeks and snorted. “Well, not yet. I was just getting used to it, right?”<br />
<br />
“Sure.” June giggled. “I know how good it feels.”<br />
<br />
“Anyway. I’m Carol if you care. Carol McHaverty.”<br />
<br />
“So, what don’t you like?” Ty laughed. “About your new body?”<br />
<br />
“The fact I’m fucking so huge I take up the whole back seat?”<br />
<br />
“I can fix that.” Ty smiled.</p>
