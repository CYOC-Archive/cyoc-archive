<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes, I see your lusty thoughts, and of those from across the fence, is a mind wishing to meet someone friendly.&quot; The Amulet spoke, but Damon was in a daydreamy state, thinking about the horses and ponies owned by a near neighbor. As one of the ponies was an eleven years-old stallion named Mike. As Mike was to Damon during both their younger years as friends and Damon liking to feel up and stroke the sheath and cock of Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah..., Amulet, I am thinking of Mike and his big cock!  We were friends in years past and could be again, if I were sharing his paddock, we funning with his mares! I you could, change me, let me have Mike show me how a stallion mates, until I might try my own ideas about equine style sex; gee that would be great fun.&quot; Damon said, and felt then the Amulet as heating up, and about to make a wish happen.<br />
<br />
All of what Damon had said culminated inot a flash of maical power. As biblically said, In thew wink of an eye,&quot; and what was Damon then changed. He felt thrilled by becoming magically as changed of species. Damon realized a stance of standing on all fours being a Pony, as the sensations had Damon feeling enthused. As with the magical amulet still draped around a much stronger neck, she felt wonderfully sexy, as ready or willing to enter equine lifestyle with a very well endowed Pony stallion.<br />
<br />
Just when Damon was about to ask the Amulet to help him join the herd with Mike the Pony, when the sound of car tired crunching on gravel bade Damon to turn and see a car coming along the driveway. &quot;Oh crap, it is Mom and Dad returning home, and with my younger sister Tina; what on earth will they think now after seeing me, me being like you so nicely changed me?&quot; Damon said in thought as a communication to the Amulet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a problem my Master, as wish it, and they all could become as mares too, and go with you to join Mike and his small herd.&quot; The Amulet communicated to Damon, and began to warm its power if his Master made a wish.<br />
<br />
When the car stopped and first his father stood outside the car, he stared at the stately standing Pony.<br />
<br />
Damon was trying to decide what he wanted more, as whether to remain a Pony with a herd, or let fate chose what was righteous. The idea of fate won for the moment and Damon then strode calmly toward his father and when they came close, Damon razed forward her muzzle to give Dad a lick at his strong hand. This calm act won his father to thinking the strange animal as tame and he began stroking the strong neck on Damon, patting it, and telling his wife and daughter it was safe to exit the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, I stand ready to cause these people to cease being human, the woman and girl are easy to make as mares, it is not any more as difficult for the man to change species and gender, both at the same time; just as I did with you!&quot; The Amulet communicated to Damon.<br />
<br />
Damon wagged his big head and in his thoughts to the Amulet he specified a definitive answer of &quot;No!&quot;  As they were communicated the warming feeling from the Amulet began to cool, and Damon felt more at ease being a Pony, and in the company of his parents and sister. As then Damon jumped, a thought of what the Amulet spoke of came as to bother the fun thrill of Damon becoming a Pony.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say, Amulet, you said it was as easy to change my dad to be a pony mare as you did to me?&quot; Damon asked as he thought and communicated with the magical bobble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master, I did as you asked, you did request to know what sex felt like of Mike and his big cock!  <br />
<br />
You were friends in years past and could be again, if sharing his paddock, he funning with his mares! <br />
<br />
You asked of me to change, as have Mike show you how a stallion mates, or until then try your own ideas about equine style sex; as gee that would be great fun. Like the pony mares in his herd and in your memory was a dappled brown and tan colored mare you toyed with, as liked her; as she died, I took her physical idenity and over-wrote your physical self to be as now that mare. You are in her lovely likeness, a very healthy three year old Welsh breed pony mare. Yet I need to warn you about mating, as breed with Mike and become impregnated, you must remain a mare until the foal is birthed and weaned. It is only then that you can return to being human, and male, but as a further warning; as after birthing a mare becomes horny to breed again. If by chance you breed and become pregnate with a second foal, you cannot ever be changed back to being human, male or female!&quot; The Amulet so comminicated.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile as both Mom and Dad conversed about the stray Pony happening to be there at their house., thier daughter being younger than Damon, was shorter by two feet of her human brother. As Damon the pony mare upset for him becoming transformed and made a mare, Tina watched with wide eyes as did the tail rise and from it boiled forth a mighty rush of mare urine to make a frothing puddle on the driveway.<br />
<br />
As Dad took his dear wife and led her to the rear porch and entrance to the house, he spoke to his daughter to beware of the pony, as a mare can still change her manners and become nasty.<br />
<br />
A mesmerized girl stood almost chest high to the back of her new friend, the mare was a brother in her past. She felt the evil urge to reach her hand and touch to the raised tail. When her soft and gentile fingers touched the high held tail, Damon jumped back and away from his sister. He turned and ran to a safer distance, but his sister followed the mare, as Damon tried to keep away from her, she ran and was more agile.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this human child is a problem to you, I could change her, she likes your female form, and would make a cute filly for company now, and in six months time would join you and Mike in the desires of mating!&quot; The ever evil Amulet offered, and in the still moral thinking mind of Damon, she held to a specific &quot;No,&quot; answer.<br />
<br />
Tina became tired of the chase and went to enter the house; she leaving Damon time to calm her raging disdain from being a mare and not a stallion. When Damon was again alone her stoutly strong equine body and feeling the sensations for being a mare; her mind began asserting new ideas, wants, and what was born human began trying to learn the new manner of eating off the ground.<br />
<br />
A fluttering breeze drew forth a scent of male musk, the equine kind, and oddly, Damon sniffed it, and felt attune to discovering the stallion, if maybe he would help Damon discover what it was to be a pony mare in estrus.</p>
