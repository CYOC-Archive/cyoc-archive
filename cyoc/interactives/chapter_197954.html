<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, we do have quite the transformation needed for our country&#39;s security&quot; Said a slightly older then middle age man with red hair wearing a kingly golden robe and red crown.<br />
<br />
&quot;One we have been assured your business would be able to handle without information spreading of this to other lands&quot; stated a bit younger then the man middle age woman with long flowing silver hair, wearing a very elaborate jade dress, queenly crown and sequin gloves, twirling what appeared to be a pair of bifocal golden opera glasses in her right hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ALT does provide anonymity for the subject, provide they fall under all the already established guidelines&quot; said the man revealed to be a much younger fellow in a red and brown suit with black hair and fingerless gloves, a name tag named &quot;Dennis&quot; shown on his jacket (a red shirt underneath said jacket) resting his elbows on the table that was placed between the royals and the man.  &quot;So what exactly is the transformation you wish to have done today?&quot;<br />
<br />
The king sighed, sitting further back in his chair twirling his left hand.  &quot;I don&#39;t wish to bore you with all the details but sadly after many years of peace with some of our neighboring lands, they have made efforts of invading our land contrary to the treaties we have made with all neighboring sectors of our world, and are in the need of a high level of protection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And considering said neighbors include some high level elemental magicians, there is only one sort of creature who can properly protect our castle and all the folk who live within it&#39;s walls; a dragon&quot; the Queen said now using her glasses to point over at Dennis.  &quot;Our kingdom doesn&#39;t specifically have those kind of creatures, at least ones that could actually be trained properly to work as guards, which is why we came to this shop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; Dennis said as he was shown taking out his labtop and typing things down.  &quot;Well the ALT would certainly be able to help craft you a dragon though I must point out, those are perhaps our most expensive transformation&quot; Dennis commented reading over some of his files.  &quot;The cheapest ones that would be able to guard an entire castle area would be at least 50,000 Golden Pieces.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm in your world&#39;s currency or in ours?&quot; The king asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yours&quot; Dennis said simply.  &quot;Thanks to the info you already gave at the first desk Lord Tenball and Lady Emmis, Monarchs of...&quot; Dennis looked through his file typing some more &quot;Indolin Of Dimensional Sub Sector 234-11S, we were able to calculate the currency exchange rate of your world in comparison to ours since trust me, we literally take thousands upon thousands of different kinds of money ever day at the ALT.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen Emmis chuckled some.  &quot;My my, perhaps we should also look into buying that... computer was it from you as well.  Seems like quite the useful technlogoical leap&quot;  She then reached into the sleeve of her dress, pulling out a fairly sizable bag.  &quot;The dragon acquisition is more important, and I assure you we are able to pay at least ten times your basic rate for a high quality beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least twenty actually&quot; the king pointed out patting his own sleeve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear as that offers you quite a lot of options&quot; Dennis said as he was shown typing down something before looking back at them.  &quot;For starters, do you have a person in mind to be transformed, or do you need to add an additional cost of having a subject we would pick out and transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
King Tenball sighed, folding his arms.  &quot;Well we did have someone in mind but your stipulations about it not being for our benefit sort of gutted that plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
The queen gently elbowed him.  &quot;Remember dear the gentleman does not understand how that statement was made as a jest, not as a threat.  And this is not a court where they wouldn&#39;t care about there being a difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right of course&quot; The king said holding out his hand.  &quot;Though seriously we would need a subject as we aren&#39;t using one of our own citizens for this but again money is not an issue here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so just adding that on then...&quot; Dennis typed some more before looking back at the two.  &quot;Then of course there would be the Kind of dragon you would wish guarding your castle.  Which again if you aren&#39;t limiting yourselves on price, there are literally thousands to choose from we could have the subject transform into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh thousands? How intriguing&quot;  Emmis commented rubbing her hands together.<br />
<br />
This time it was Tenbell who gently elbowed his wife back.  &quot;We need to have the beast guarding our people as soon as possible dear not the weeks it would take to look through all possible choices.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ennis sighed.  &quot;True&quot; she looked over at the dealer.  &quot;Can you give us then the best choices to go through and we&#39;ll pick from that list?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no problem&quot; Dennis looked over his notes a few moments on the computer scanning through various images he pulled up before smiling back at the pair.  &quot;Okay think I found the best types for you.&quot;  He pointed over at a more green looking gigantic snake creature with various tendrils from it&#39;s side going into the ground.  &quot;There&#39;s The Land Wyrm, who though has no power of flight are extraordinarily quick and can traverse through the grounds being able to move and manipulate earth at their will.  Good for keeping out enemies more land locked.&quot;  He then showed an image of a huge clawed red dragon with fiery eyes and spikes sticking out from it&#39;s back.  &quot;There&#39;s The Flame Drake who aren&#39;t as quick as Land Wyrms and also lack flight, but have incredibly strong defense and have the full gambit of fire related abilities.  Not just of normal red or even blue flame but can shoot out magma instantly.&quot;  He then showed an image of a dark brown dragon with giant wings and who had a large blade at the end of it&#39;s tail.  &quot;Then there&#39;s the Wicked Wyvern.  It&#39;s fire techniques aren&#39;t as strong as a Flame Drake but in addition to the power of flight it&#39;s sharp blade like tail can not only impale enemies but also produces a powerful poison that can infect most enemies within seconds of being hit.&quot;  He then showed an image of a mammoth of a white dragon with various white spikes sticking out from all around the creature.  &quot;This is the Bewilderbeast.  It&#39;s easily the largest of the dragons we have available for transformation which does technically make it the slowest but it&#39;s not only ridiculously tough, those spikes around it&#39;s body can be shot out like needle cannons some of which can explode on contact with the enemy that it knows how to aim to ensure allies would not get hit as well.  Though obviously that aspect of not harming allies would extend to all of these creatures.&quot;  He then showed an image of a far smaller scalier dark blue dragon with small tiny wings allowing it to hover energy coursing around it.  &quot;Then there&#39;s the Thunderclaw which technically is the smallest of all of these dragon groups but this one also controls the most powerful of all elemental dragon abilities; lightning and Thunder.  And it can shock opponents from even miles away through thunderclouds it commands.&quot;  Dennis then showed the image of another large dragon this one black with different kinds of spike sticking out and a huge set of teeth on the dragon&#39;s head (sticking out of a smaller neck) giving a wicked smile.  &quot;Then there&#39;s the Monstrous Nightmare.  The most intimidating of the dragons but one who does not attack physically rather.  Rather it uses it&#39;s spike to send out psychic residue to it&#39;s opponents and emotionally rip them apart through nightmares and visions it projects into the victim&#39;s mind.&quot;  He then showed one last picture of a light blue dragon with huge majestic wings soaring through the sky.  &quot;And finally the Snow Wraith the most majestic and physically appeasing of the dragon types.  The snow wraith obviously also uses the element of Ice and snow to freeze and break apart opponents and though may not be as strong as some of the other types, is easily the best flyer of the group.&quot;  Dennis then clasped his hands together.  &quot;So which of those choices would you like to go with for your dragon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm&quot; the king and queen thought pondering the pro and con of each pick before making their choice...</p>
