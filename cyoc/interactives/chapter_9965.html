<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning a well rested Roger got up and felt free as a bird. Today was better than any day he'd had in twenty years of marriage. Today and from now on he was free to do the day as he saw fit, or so he thought!<br />
<br />
A hardy breakfast and then he turned to his early morning chores. As with any farm the animals must be tended to, and today he had three new ones to boot.<br />
<br />
As Roger entered the barn he was met by Elroy. The large and well matured Donkey stood in all his glory. Roger took a hold to Elroy's halter and led him back to his box stall. Turning to look down at his Brian Donkey he smiled thinking of what that kid thought he was going to get away with, but Roger had other plans today.<br />
<br />
A snuffling Jenny Donkey stood quivering maybe of fear, or still ravaged by heated sexual desires. Roger ignored her noises and went straight to feeding the three plus his two trotter mares that paid for the farm in winnings.<br />
<br />
Not a word did Roger offer to his Wife, Son, or ex-farmhand, doing his barn chores he soon walked back to the house. A little chuckle came from his lips as he entered the kitchen door.<br />
<br />
As in houses built 60 years back the telephone held a place of special honor. In Roger's house there was a small encove built under the stairs leading to it's second story. Roger opened the tall narrow door which was as much like an oldtime phone booth as one might imagine.<br />
<br />
The phone was hung on the inside wall and two shelves built below. One was to hold the phone book while the other was as a small writing desk, very quaint!<br />
<br />
Opening the phone book his fingers raced through the business blue section till he smiled. &quot;Pleasure Island Amusement Park, &quot;631-3400, odd he thought but it was a local number!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly his fingers danced the phone's keys as the ringing began inside the Park.<br />
<br />
&quot;P.I.A.P. Information Desk!&quot; came a quick answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes I'm looking for the party.......&quot; Roger started to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missing Persons, I'll connect you that extension, 2190!&quot; said the operator as she dialed Roger away from his question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missing, yawn! Ah Persons department, state name and date that subject came to the Park.&quot; said the rather tired sounding voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I want to know who might have sold my Son some blue powdered mixture which turns people into Donkeys?&quot; asked Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, do what? Are you pulling my leg buddy? Your talking magic tricks and we have a bunch that do tricks but nobody, I repeat nobody really turns into a Donkey!&quot; says the person as they begin to laugh.<br />
<br />
Roger is dumbfounded and remains quiet as the Missing Persons' person makes a suggestion. &quot;Well lets check our register of Magic acts and see if any might fill your bill!&quot; replies the person with still a soft bit of laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Circe's House, or the Donkey Mill Bar, Madame' Illusia's theater, ah maybe the Pleasure Island Nightclub, oh and the real swinger's spot, the Pleasure Island Fantasy, it's a strip club with massage parlor, neat! Well that's my list for magic acts, although there are several other places about the Park which offer simular fantasy situations!&quot; said the person.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they all boast of changing people into Donkeys?&quot; asked Roger being stunned to the great number of possiblities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our Park has many such places to aid customers find their own personal fantasies! The fantasy of being transformed into an animal is quite the rage about, and I've heard the stories of those who went plum crazy and really believe they spent several years as different animals inside the Park. Why I can tell stories about those who believe their loved ones were changed into pigs, goats, or even cattle and sent for a time or eternity to one of our supplier' farms. I can't say but maybe that blue powder you asked about does something to them, but really nobody ever gets changed into an animal, noway!&quot; replies the person.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I want to talk to one of those possible fantasy places anyway!' ordered Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold the line and I'll connect you!&quot; came the quick reply.<br />
<br />
Clickity click, &quot;Good Morning Circe's House of Fantasy, who is calling?&quot; asked a pleasent and sweet sounding female voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Roger N...nevermind the last name, I was calling to find out if your boss uses a blue powder to exicte your customers into be....believing their changed into animals?&quot; asked Roger holding back what he knew to be true.<br />
<br />
Laughing, &quot;Excite, why my dear man we do far more than just excite those who enter here!&quot; came the quick reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well is it really true, I mean have you seen some person changed?&quot; aske Roger now showing real interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I seen anybody changed, yes, Me! I came here looking for a wonderful fantasy and was granted one which for the past, ah, ah, past nine years I've enjoyed.&quot; said the young lady as Roger got a little antsey.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your... fantasy, if I might ask?&quot; asked Roger being a little hesitent.<br />
<br />
A giggle, &quot;I saw here a girl made to look like a female Satyr! You know a half goat half human creature filled with lust for sexual pleasures, and willing to lead men to their doom, that's me! I like it too!&quot; she said with now a rolling laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really!&quot; said Roger as his imagination began to get the best of him and he was fast becoming erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you called about a blue powder that does the trick, right? I'll ask the Misstress and get back to you, or do you wish to hold?&quot; she asked and offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll hold on!&quot; said Roger as he shivered inside his private phone booth.<br />
<br />
A few minutes went by till the phone came alive once again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Roger is it, I'm Misstress Circe the owner and manager here, could I be of some service?&quot; offered the Queer of TF.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I hope so, thank you, I have here three Donkeys which were people once. The three drank of some blue powder which when mixed in water becomes, I expect a potion of some sort. Anyway they drank it ans since then one has become a verile and mature Jackass. One became a mature and in season' Jenny. While another who was only a teenager became a colt Donkey but is also very ah....say flamboyant!&quot; told Roger of his problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't use a blue powder or ever sell my potions out on the street! I offer men of all kinds their wildest sexual fantasy and when some have attained the absolute peak in beastly manners, well they find a real fantasy then! I'd check with Madame' Illusia, press &quot;o&quot; and ask for extension # 2322.&quot; explained Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks ever so much I might come and visit you someday!&quot; suggested a nervous Roger.<br />
<br />
Circe laughed, &quot;Don't bother to pack a bag, I think someone like you will find our island a good place to stay!&quot; said Circe.<br />
<br />
Roger punched the &quot;0&quot; and asked the operator to connect him with extension #2322. &quot;Right, the beast maker Bitch!&quot; came a quick reply as the phone call was forwarded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning I hope, Madame' Illusia's Theater, Stephen speaking!&quot; said a clear but young sounding male voice.<br />
<br />
Again Roger asked his question about a blue powder and it's ability to change those drinking it as potion. <br />
<br />
A short pause, then Stephen asked, &quot;The three Donkeys, two males, one Jenny, correct? Well we do use the blue powder and charge for it too! What is you reason for calling, certainly not to but more powder?&quot; asked Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no thanks, but I have three Donkeys I can't use, I breed and run Trotting horses on my farm! I was wondering if you might like them as your powder changed them to Donkeys?&quot; asked Roger feeling now ever so nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, a true heartless farmer, is ready to sell his own family and friends being now Donkeys for dirty money!&quot; grumbled Stephen at Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sell, no I want to give them back to you for whatever service you deem proper!&quot; replied Roger quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you will give them to us for work and a life inside the Park?&quot; asked Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, yes, I would you to pick them up and take these Donkeys to wherever you please! I race and breed American Trotting horses here and have not one use for, Donkeys!&quot; said Roger now sounding even more urgent to rid himself of Elroy, Brian, and his wife Mable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I'll send a truck tomorrow and take them off your hands!&quot; replied Stephen. &quot;Be very sure that the Jenny be not pregnant from either the Jacks! Cause if she is my Madame will be very upset about being given USED merchandise, very upset!&quot; said Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow then I'll be here to help the loading!&quot; said Roger as he wondered if and how many times Elroy took his pleasures with Mable.</p>
