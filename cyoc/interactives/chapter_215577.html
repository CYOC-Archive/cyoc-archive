<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer awoke suddenly, gasping for breath as if it was her first time breathing.<br />
Her eyes widened and her heavy breathing ceased when she saw her body; her left arm and right leg were gone, replaced by Mechanical ones &quot;Auto Mail&quot; her mind retrieved the information from memories that she didn&#39;t know she had. The rest of her body was severely damaged, scars carved throughout her pale flesh.<br />
The blonde&#39;s breathing became erratic again, tears streamed down her face as she clutched her mutilated body into a fedal position. <br />
After what must of been an hour of crying she picked her damaged body up. It was hard to walk with her new right leg at first but she got used to it as she moved.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was in too much shock before to realize it but she was completely nude!<br />
Blushing and trying to cover herself up and ran to an old cabin that must have been abandoned, she looked around but couldn&#39;t find a single scrap of clothing. Defeated, she fell to her knees and slammed her hands on the ground knocking down a nearby curtain that fell in front of her. The girl brought her hands together in prayer and begged for at least something to wear but to no avail, then she punt her hands back on the ground to get up, thats when it happened.<br />
<br />
A wave of information entered her mind, chemicals, formulas and symbols. In an instant a flash of blue light and the old curtain was suddenly a long hooded coat. She looked at it, not knowing what to think. Before she could do anything else she put on the newly formed jacket; it was a lilac color with long sleeves and a hood, it stopped just below her knees. <br />
She held the jacket-like-thing with her new mechanical arm and started walking along the dirt side road, hoping she could find a town or something. <br />
<br />
Along the way she thought about what happened in the cabin, how this curtain turned into a cloak. Then she thought about what that Truth guy said, &quot;Amestris...equivalent exchange...&quot; something about that sounded familiar somehow.<br />
Then it hit her. Kyle! She remembered last year he sat behind her in one of their classes, Kyle and his other dorky friends were talking about some anime, Full-mental-something? No was it Metal? She couldn&#39;t quite remember but she could recall something about alchemy and trans-something circuit...no circle!<br />
All this thinking was giving her a headache, it&#39;s like her mind was being filled with new information: chemicals, formulas, mathematics, physics, science, along with strange circles and symbols.<br />
<br />
She continued walking along the dirt road until she came upon railroad tracks.<br />
The scarred girl decided to follow the tracks, hoping to reach some kind of civilization. After more walking the tracks started to shake and a train sped past her. The train wasn’t a modern one like she expected, but a more traditional looking train. The other strange thing was that it was carrying rows upon rows of tarp covered cargo, the only thing she could determine about the covered cargo was the unmistakable giant barrels of tanks.<br />
<br />
(I wonder where they’re heading?<br />
And I don’t know if I should be heading in that direction.)<br />
<br />
Jennifer was reluctant to follow in the same direction as the train, following a train full of tanks probably wasn’t the best idea.<br />
So she began to walk in the direction the train was coming from, clutching her cloak over her naked, disfigured, body.<br />
<br />
Soon night fell, and the barely clothed girl needed to find somewhere to spend the night. She split from the railway to the nearby forest. On the edge of the forest she leaned upon a large tree and fell to a sitting position.<br />
Jennifer thought about what happened in the cabin, how this cloak somehow manifested itself, seemingly upon her request. <br />
Deciding she had nothing more she could lose she once again clasped her hands in prayer,<br />
<br />
“Please, please give me some kind of shelter, like a shed or small shack.”<br />
<br />
After waiting a minute she opened her eyes and let her arms fall to her sides. In that moment a the strange circular symbols appeared in her mind. Not random ones though; a specific one.<br />
<br />
(What a strange pattern…)<br />
<br />
She couldn’t get it out of her head, she leaned back on a nearby rock and idly began tracing the symbol in the dirt.<br />
<br />
(Weird, that kind of reminds me of a thing Melissa used to draw… I wonder…)<br />
<br />
Melissa Harding was a girl from her English class. She was a goth girl, who always wore black with dark black eye makeup and such. Melissa was obsessed with occult and “dark magic”. The goth girl would draw these symbols that were similar to the ones she found floating in her mind.<br />
<br />
Another place she remembered seeing these sorts of things was from one of her Freshman Chemistry classes; the only reason she remembers anything from that class was because of Mr. Littman. He was a younger handsome teacher who almost every girl had a crush on. <br />
During one of his lectures, Jennifer remembered something he said while she was starring dreamily at him,<br />
<br />
“…Alchemy was an early form of chemistry, practiced by the likes of Peter Abelard and Isaac Newton…”<br />
<br />
The Jennifer thought about how he said that alchemy was practiced as some kind of magic, that must have been the reason Melissa was drawing those symbols.<br />
Then it struck her. She remembered her cloak was the same material as the curtain that fell, and the curtain was gone when her cloak appeared.<br />
It must have been some kind of magic?! <br />
<br />
(No! Not magic. Scientific, chemical, Alchemical.)<br />
Her thoughts corrected her.<br />
<br />
To try out her theory she began by gathering some sticks and rocks, and placed them inside the symbol. The blonde placed her hands on the symbol and thought of a bonfire. <br />
Then it happened again: she felt a spark go trough her body, and with a blue light the materials she gathered became a small, stone lined, fire pit. <br />
She jumped back and stared at her creation, excited and intrigued that it worked. The girl curled next to the fire and a thought occurred to her before drifting off the sleep:<br />
<br />
(I don’t remember any kind of markings or circles when I made my jacket. How did I do that without one of those circle thingies?<br />
Oh well… I’m sure I’ll figure it out later)</p>
