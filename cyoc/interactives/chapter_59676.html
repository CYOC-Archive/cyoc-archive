<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That behavior...&quot; Dave said slowly, &quot;It's just wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the part of Molly's parents?&quot; I asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Dave replied, &quot;I mean, she may be a tigress now, but she's still a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it depends on how you define what is a &quot;person&quot;, I guess,&quot; I sighed, &quot;I hate it too, especially from the way it's affected Molly, but it isn't a crime... so what can I really do? Molly and I moved out here to get away from the worst of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for that I can be glad, as we became friends as a result,&quot; Dave commented, &quot;a silver lining to every dark cloud as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; I smiled.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I returned to Columbia Falls as quickly as I could. Molly's mother's behavior was disgraceful, but there was nothing I could do about that. And there was plenty that there was to do in Columbia Falls to get our lives going on our own. That is what I decided to focus on. I couldn't change Molly's mother, but I could deal with what it would take to get things ready.<br />
<br />
I quietly drove up to Frank Rhoer's home to find Molly waiting for me on the front porch. I could swear that I saw her face brighten as I parked the truck. As I put the vehicle in park and shut the engine off, I felt the driver's side door open.<br />
<br />
&quot;George!&quot; Molly gave a cheer and leaned in to rub my cheeks with her head and muzzle, again tickling me with her fur, &quot;It's good to see you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's good to see you too,&quot; I responded, reaching with one hand to pat Molly's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did everything go?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;Did you get your transcripts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; I nodded, as I got out, &quot;In terms of long term career preparation, I thin we're well on our way.&quot;<br />
<br />
I found myself being lifted into a firm hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so glad,&quot; Molly smiled with a low rumble.<br />
<br />
I hugged her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, all we need to do is set ourselves up with a place to live,&quot; I commented, &quot;and make sure we have some cash on hand until I'm fully trained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Frank has said we can stay with him and his daughters until we find a place,&quot; Molly told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very generous of him... unlike some...&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
I turned and pulled a spare duffel bag from the back seat and handed it to Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I picked up the rest of your dresses while I was back home,&quot; I spoke, &quot;It'll save you on laundry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly looked in the bag and smiled, &quot;Thanks, George.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother didn't see to really care,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
Molly replied with a hissing growl and then sighed, &quot;come on, George, it's nearly diner time.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and went in with her, taking my clothes and application information with me. Tomorrow would bring about the next series of challenges.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where would you want to live?&quot; I asked as we got to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd prefer a more rural setting... but I don't mind living in town,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;I've done some checking, the small &quot;apartments&quot; they have here do not appear to have any vacancies... and they appear to be in a bad neighborhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to see what I can do,&quot; I sighed as we went in,&quot; I commented, &quot;Meredeth and Nessie said that the land prices would be pretty high.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded, &quot;I'm sure we'll find a way.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next day I set about the work that needed to be done. I started with driving Molly to the school were she was working as an aide. I learned that she had become popular with the kids, though she apparently remained the &quot;tiger lady&quot; to them. Once that was done, I began to drive to the police station to turn in my resume and transcripts. I felt pretty lucky when I met Chief Harold near the front desk. He was getting coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Wayne,&quot; Officer Harold spoke, &quot;you've returned...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;my girlfriend did get the post that had brought us out here, so it took me a little while to get everything you said you needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The tigress, I presume?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your girlfriend, she's the &quot;tiger lady&quot; down at the school,&quot; Officer Harold explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; I admitted, &quot;that won't be a problem, will it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have my private fears,&quot; Officer Harold told me, &quot;but so long as she obeys the law... and I mean HUMAN law, not the law of the jungle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not going to lose herself to her instincts,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Officer Harold commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I have my resume and transcripts that you said you needed,&quot; I said, returning the reason I had come to the station.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Officer Harold spoke, &quot;Let's go to my office and we'll have a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again I followed him. Once in the office I handed my resume and transcripts. Officer Harold looked at them rather intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your resume looks good,&quot; Officer Harold answered, &quot;you and your girlfriend have come a long way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but your air is cleaner and there is more open space out here,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That it is,&quot; Officer Harold nodded and began looking through my transcripts, &quot;your grades seem to slip a little in you senior year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was pretty distracted at that time, dealing with Molly's transformation,&quot; I explained, &quot;I'm sure you've seen reports about that on the news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were caring for her, then,&quot; Officer Harold surmised.<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You strike me as a fairly noble man,&quot; Officer Harold answered, &quot;to do all that for her... but to business, do you have a place to stay? We'll need an address for the application to the academy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been staying with Frank Rhoer, but we don't have a permanent place to live yet,&quot; I answered, &quot;it's part of the suddenness of the good fortune that you and the Columbia Falls School District have given Molly and I. I'll be looking for a place as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now, we'll use the station address as your return address until you get a more permanent address,&quot; Officer Harold spoke, &quot;I'll give the desk officer instructions told hold onto your mail... do you have a cell-phone?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;I haven't tested the reception yet, but yes I have one.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then gave him the number. It took about half an hour to do, but we got the application for the academy done, which was all that could be done in that direction for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your help, sir,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome,&quot; Officer Harold replied with a very fatherly smile, &quot;I wish you the best of luck in finding a place to live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I'll probably need it,&quot; I replied, &quot;sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Outside the police station, I began to ponder how Molly and I would find a place to live. Considering our budget, especially Molly's food and what would likely be medical costs, we wouldn't have much, and I couldn't expect my parents to be able to help all that much, and I didn't expect Molly's to help at all. Molly and I had agreed to actually rent at first until we had enough to seriously consider buying a home... but we would need to do some research... and possibly talk to someone, preferably a real estate agent, as they would know what the housing market was in Columbia Falls.<br />
<br />
But I had only one phone number on me, and I knew the number wasn't for a real estate agent. Seeing that my phone did get reception, I sighed and dialed the number.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can't believe it took you that long to call me,&quot; Dave commented, though mostly teasing it seemed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you before that I had been busy with more permanent job applications,&quot; I responded, &quot;I had just completed that part and had the time to call you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn't have just let me know what you were doing?&quot; Dave teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't really know you then,&quot; I sighed, &quot;we'd only just met at that diner. Certainly, you don't expect life-long friends to form over night, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... they talk about love at first sight,&quot; Dave smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you're not playing THAT card are you?&quot; I decided to tease back, &quot;what would your wife and daughter say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, bad reference... but people do get along well at the first meeting,&quot; Dave answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still isn't the same as a life-long friend,&quot; I answered, &quot;anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I dialed and waited for an answer. Eventually I heard an exhausted voice answer the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Mr. Choir...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Dave,&quot; Dave answered, trying to hide that he was out of breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... Dave,&quot; I replied, &quot;this is George Wayne, we met a few days ago at the diner...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have plenty for you to do,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;while you're waiting for this training of yours, though I thought you would have called me sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry about that, I was working on some stuff related to the application for the academy, which I've just completed,&quot; I answered, &quot;I have some questions about real estate, and since you're the only person I know in Columbia Falls, I was wondering if we could meet somewhere and talk. I can even help with some of your vineyard work while we talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;not sure what you mean by real estate, but I'll do what I can. Just take the dirt road heading toward the mountains south and east of town. Don't worry to much about the details. I got permission from the city to put up signs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I told him, &quot;I'll be right out.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Dave hung up and I continued on to my truck and was soon following the directions he had given me. They struck me as rather vague, but when I came across a sign that advertised the vineyard, I was pretty sure I had found the right route. The road appeared to have few if any intersecting roads to it, but I soon saw a sign for Dave's vineyard on the road that was to be followed.<br />
<br />
As I drove along, the road began to zig-zag its way up one of the foothills and the evergreen scent carried in on the breeze, and the forest scene around us was wonderful to look at. After a little while though, I came to Dave's vineyard, and the sight-seeing was over.</p>
