<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nina and Scarlet kept heading towards home, trying to make it as far as they could before it got dark. &quot;Didn&#39;t you say something about it getting dangerous at night in the woods?&quot; Nina asked Scarlet, slightly worried. &quot;Nah, my sister used to tell me that when I was younger, but I doubt it&#39;s true, at least not anywhere around here. Besides, what exactly could happen?&quot; This reassured Nina as she did not know exactly what could happen.<br />
<br />
They walked for about an hour only to come to the realization that they were lost. &quot;Great, the sun is setting and we don&#39;t know where we are and we won&#39;t even be able to see anything when the sun completely sets.&quot; Scarlet mumbled being very annoyed at the unlucky circumstances that had occurred.<br />
<br />
Nina was enjoying the walk a lot more than Scarlet was and was completely okay with the possibility of being trapped in the forest at night. &quot;well then, have you been here before?&quot; Scarlet asked, &quot;Nope.&quot; Nina replied without really paying any attention.<br />
<br />
Scarlet wondered how they could have gotten lost. They had walked back in the same direction they had came save for a few turns she was sure that they had made the first time. If they took a wrong turn it couldn&#39;t have been that far back. Scarlet decided that it would be best if they backtracked a ways to see when they noticed anything familiar. She motioned towards Nina and the two set off back towards the mysterious house.<br />
<br />
Scarlet and Nina eventually reached a spot they recognized. It was dark now and and they needed to get home. &quot;Wait a minute, where&#39;s the trail heading towards the house?&quot; Nina asked curiously. Scarlet looked at where she was certain the trail had been and could not find anything but ordinary looking grass and trees. This was all getting a bit weird and Scarlet wasn&#39;t sure about which way to backtrack since she was so certain that the first trail they had taken was the correct way. She decided to take the both of them in the direction closest to the previous one, hoping that it would be correct but being completely unsure.<br />
<br />
Both girls walked on until it was about midnight. &quot;Hey Nina, you brought your phone right?&quot; Scarlet asked hoping for a yes in reply. &#39;Yeah I did, but it died about an hour ago&quot;. This did not impress Scarlet for they were still lost and had no chance to contact anyone. Scarlet had no choice but to give in to the fact that they would have to build camp, which was something that she really hated to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina, go find some firewood&quot;. Nina set off to do just that while Scarlet looked around for something to sleep on and cleared out an area to build a fire. As they searched, Nina came by a river with a strong current. She saw a fallen tree on the other side  of the river and realized that it would make a good fire. Nina stripped down to her undergarments and began to cross the river.<br />
<br />
Scarlet finished with what she was doing and realized that Nina was taking a long time. She walked towards the direction that Nina had walked in and eventually come alongside the same river and saw that Nina was on the other side. &quot;What are you doing over there?&quot; Scarlet yelled. &quot;I found some firewood.&quot; Nina yelled back holding some of the firewood in her hands.Scarlet then noticed something nearing Nina. It was a tree, and it was falling, fast. &quot;Nina Watch out!&quot; Scarlet yelled to her friend in desperation, but it was too late by the time Nina realized why. <br />
<br />
The tree had fallen, hitting her on the shoulder, crushing it. Nina was bleeding to death. Scarlet quickly jumped into the water and swam as fast as she could. Nina was taking her last breath as she drifted off, dead. <br />
<br />
Scarlet quickly made it to the other side of the river to find her friend lying on the ground. She definitely looked dead, but not as if she had died due to a fallen tree. Nina&#39;s arm looked perfectly fine just like the rest of her body did. Scarlet was curious but to sad to be hopeful. She held her friends body, weeping over it with water dripping from her skin. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the unthinkable happened. Nina started breathing again. She coughed a few times and opened her eyes. Scarlet was confused, but still relieved as well that her friend was alive. Scarlet hugged her friend as Nina looked at her in surprise. &quot;What just happened?&quot; Nina asked with a confuzzled at Scarlet&#39;s actions. &quot;You just died, but now your back somehow.&quot; Scarlet stated while still holding her friend. <br />
<br />
Scarlet then noticed something different about her friend. Nina&#39;s eyes were yellow, a very deep and noticeable yellow. Nina&#39;s pupils were also slitted much like a cats. Scarlet also noticed a few other things. Nina&#39;s canines were longer and sharper and she now had sharp claws as well. Scarlet had no idea what was wrong with her friend. Perhaps the potion they had drank actually did do something.</p>
