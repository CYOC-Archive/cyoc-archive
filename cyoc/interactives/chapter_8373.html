<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin came back home from the mall. Now that he was a millionaire, thanks to Peter, he could afford spending a few dollars with good clothing and video games. He entered home by the kitchen door, as usual, and since he was carrying a lot if packages it was really difficult to see his way in – “Can someone give me a hand here?”<br />
“Let me help you!” Said a deep voice, and quickly all the packages were easily taken from Dustin’s arms – “Thanks, I am really tired…. ARGGGGGGGGGGHHH!” yelled Ty’s brother when he realized who he was talking with – a 7’7” tall enormously muscular man! His shoulders were inhumanly broad and his muscles bulged immensely. He couldn’t see his face from where he was standing, so muscular and big the chest on that man was.<br />
“TY! PETER! HELP ME!” Dustin yelled trying to run away but as soon as he realized he wasn’t going anywhere, the huge man was gently, but firmly holding his hand.<br />
“Please don’t be afraid! I don’t want hurt you, I was just trying to help you out with the packages!” The man said in a gentle tone, but Dustin was still scared at the size of him.<br />
Suddenly, Peter and Ty entered the room laughing out loud.<br />
“What are you to laughing at? This isn’t funny!” Dustin protested but son he heard the huge man laughing hard as well.<br />
“Dustin, I want you to meet my little brother Ryan!” Peter said still clearing his eyes from the laughing tears. Dustin looked even more puzzled now.<br />
“Nice to meet you Dustin, are you my new little cousin?” Ryan asked shaking the teenager hands strongly, along with his owner.<br />
“Little brother? How? I mean, for real? But he is - And you are” Dustin kept trying to figure out the situation but it was obviously too much for him. Fortunately Ty and Peter explained the whole thing to Dustin who now seemed to understand.<br />
“You should see your face when you saw Ryan in the kitchen!” Ty smiled as he mocked from Dustin’s face.<br />
“Well, it’s not everyday you see a giant hanging out in the kitchen!”<br />
“You think I am a giant? COOL!” Ryan said as he devoured another subway sandwich.<br />
“Anyway, Peter, are you sure growing him so much was a good idea?” Dustin asked a little concerned. “He is only nine years old!”<br />
“He is in perfect health condition, Dustin! 7’7” 425 pounds of the mightiest muscle!” Peter said proud of his little huge brother.<br />
“You did a very cool job with him cousin!” Ty said with a clinical doctor – “You were able to keep his boyish features in his face, but the muscles are definitely bigger and stronger than any adult bodybuilder could ever attain!”<br />
“That’s my big bro!” Ryan said brushing Peter’s hair.<br />
“So, Ryan what do you want to do now?” Peter asked laughing<br />
“Well, I wanted to test my strength!” Ryan concluded after a major burp.<br />
Ty and Peter exchanged looks – “okay then, let’s go to the gym down the street, there are some big guys there and I am curious to see you kick their butts!” Ty said as they walked out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Wayne Hoffman, the gym manager, had to rub his eyes when he saw HIM entering the door, actually he had to duck, a HUGE, the BIGGEST man Wayne ever saw, and he had been a professional bodybuilder.<br />
“c-can I help you?” he asked as the behemoth approached his desk, he expected the big man would talk, but instead it was one of the three teens who came along with the giant that did the talking – “Yes, my little brother wanted to work out a little, how much for a day?”<br />
“15 dollars each!” Wayne said dumb folded, because the enormous man had already drawn the attention of all the guys working inside the gym. Everybody stared at his impressive figure. Meanwhile, Peter paid the fee, and the four of them entered the gym.<br />
There were huge men working out with amazing loads, but they simply couldn’t take their eyes from the gargantuan bulk of the man who just entered the room.<br />
Dustin works out to keep in shape so he explained Ryan the techniques of each exercise, but when it comes to the load he would use – “Let’s try 200 pounds!” Dustin guessed, but when he saw Ryan lifting the bar with his pinky finger, he thought it would be better if he tried 400 for bench presses, even so Ryan did over 100 reps without breaking a sweat.<br />
“This is FUN!” The enormous kid said. He quickly got used to the exercises.<br />
Ryan did bench press with 700 pounds load, then he did leg press with 1400 pounds, he used 500 pounds for biceps curls just because they didn’t have bigger bars.<br />
“He could use the bench press bars!” Peter suggested and soon the KID was curling two huge bars with over 1000 pounds on each hand.<br />
The rest of the bodybuilders just stopped to watch Ryan training, he was a natural, he mastered every technique – little did they know that it was Peter who was mentally giving instructions to Ryan’s brain, feeding him with the better movements, the knowledge to work every muscle croup with maximized efficiency. And they could see Ryan’s muscles peaking huge, getting even more ripped, and better defined, if it was possible.<br />
It was then Ryan saw another huge man working out his biceps curling almost 200 pounds on each arm, he giggled.<br />
“Gee man, you’re gotta work harder! I know you have little muscles, but if you work harder, maybe someday you can be like me!” Ryan flexed his 33 inches biceps and the bald man just dropped his weight – “SHIT! THEY’RE HUGE!” The huge men gathered around, and the same bald bad looking man asked.<br />
“Hey dude, why come I never see you around?”<br />
“That’s because he is new around here!” Peter tried to sound friendly<br />
“Are you on drugs man?” he asked with a fierce curiosity.<br />
“ME? NO! I NEVER USED DRUGS!” Ryan sounded offended and Ty felt they needed to help him.<br />
“Look mister, he is my cousin, and I can assure you, he is not on drugs!”<br />
Then Wayne Hoffman, the manager calmed the bald bodybuilder – “Hey Butch, let the kids alone okay? Maybe he has better genetics!”<br />
When the bully returned to his work out routine Peter looked seriously at Ryan’s face.<br />
“You shouldn’t mock from those who are smaller than you!” the older brother said and Ryan leaned his eyes – “I’m sorry!”<br />
“You’re telling me?” Peter pointed at the bald man and Ryan went near him.<br />
“I am sorry I mocked at your muscles, you’re pretty strong man, please forgive me!” He said with his voice in a low tone.<br />
“Hey man, no problem, you were just pumped from your work out, I can see that!” They shook hands and Ryan returned to his spot, where Peter waited smiling – “Nice! I know you’re not a bad boy!”<br />
Suddenly it was Wayne again – “Excuse me, but if you want, I can give your name to my agent, he can get everything ready for you to become a pro!”<br />
“Pro? What does it mean?” Ryan asked puzzled.<br />
“He said you can become a professional bodybuilder if you want Ryan!” Dustin was surprised how fast he was beginning liking that boy.<br />
“YEAH! With a body like that you can go all the way to the TOP, I’ve never seen someone so big like you! I’m sure you can go to the Olympia show in no time!”<br />
“REALLY? Can I become a professional, Peter?” Ryan begged with his big puppy eyes.<br />
Peter smiled, he approached Wayne and tapped his shoulder.<br />
“Wayne, I am very flattered that you want my little brother to become a professional bodybuilder, but  the fact is that he can’t compete now, he is under aged!”<br />
“What you mean? He isn’t an adult yet? WOW!” Wayne digested that fact for a while, but then he insisted – “That’s even better, we could put him in the teenager shows! He’ll blow off every contestants!”<br />
Ty, Peter, looked at each other, and then it was Ryan’s turn to speak.<br />
“Mister Hoffman, I can’t go to a teenager contest, I am just nine!” <br />
Then, every single man in the room dropped their weights, bars, and jaws.<br />
The silence remained for over five minutes when the bald man dared to approach Ryan.<br />
“You’re only nine years old?”<br />
“You bet I am! Going on 10 in less than three months!” Ryan answered proud of himself.<br />
For the next half hour Ryan could not leave the place, every one wanted to talk with him, ask him to flex, feel his enormous muscles, they even tried to call some TV reporter, but Peter managed to get Ryan out of the gym, before it was too late.<br />
<br />
“WOW! They really liked me!” Ryan said as he still flexed his arms to his now much smaller audience.<br />
“You’re really something Ryan!” Dustin said as he felt Ryan’s abs for the tenth time.<br />
“Thanks!” Ryan answered, but both Ty and Peter could notice he wasn’t complete happy.<br />
“What happened Ryan?” Ty asked as they approached the same basketball court where it all started.<br />
“Well, it’s nothing very important, but, you know, I am… oh never mind!”<br />
“You’re not satisfied with your muscles?” Peter didn’t even need to read Ryan’s mind to guess his thought.<br />
“WHAT? The kid is the most muscular man in the planet!” Dustin said shocked.<br />
“What do you REALLY want little brother?” Peter asked tenderly.<br />
Ryan blushed, then he handled an old comic book issue to Peter. It was all wrinkled and the issue had been glued together with tape.<br />
“You like the Incredible Hulk?” Ty asked as he noticed the cover.<br />
“YEAH! Whenever I could get hide some money from Stanley I’ve urged to the newsstand to buy myself one of his comic book! Look at his muscle! No one is stronger than HULK, and no one has bigger and more ripped muscles!”<br />
“I’ve seen the movie, but the thing is  he just TOO BIG!” Dustin said casually as he sat on the floor – “No one could be THAT BIG!” <br />
It was like Ryan’s eyes were lit, his whole face shone with he mere thought.<br />
Dustin noticed what he had just said and judging by the looks on Peter and Ty’s faces, another magic trick was bound to happen.<br />
“Are you sure you want be THAT big Ryan?” Ty asked already guessing the answer.<br />
The kid just nodded his head so excited he was.<br />
“That’s just great!” Dustin laughed “You wanna go green skinned too?”<br />
“No, Dustin, he doesn’t! Ryan has an interesting desire for muscle! He wants the power to become a superhero, but in his case, he wants MUSCLE! Bigger than anything in the world, he doesn’t want to remain human anymore, he always wanted to be like that character, so he could protect everyone he loves, Ryan has a big hear, and he wants bigger muscles to go with!” Ty said as he stood aside Peter, who was still afraid.<br />
“I’m not sure I can do something like that, cousin! He is asking for a complete and permanent transformation, so far I have to focus on keeping him that big, I am not sure I’ll be able to change him permanently.” Peter projected his thoughts into Ty’s head.<br />
“Hey cousin, I am not recognizing you! You’re the one who said we can do whatever we want if we want it!” Ty cheered Peter up.<br />
“Ryan sure deserves it, but the problem is, I am afraid, I never did something so big in my life, it has to be perfect, otherwise I can harm Ryan!”<br />
“What if we join powers? I am almost as strong as you know, we can do it together, we can turn Ryan into the muscle monster he wants to be!”<br />
Peter looked at Ty’s eyes and they hugged each other. Ryan remained puzzled.<br />
“Okay, bro, here’s the deal! We’ll give you the power to make your comic book hero lok like a toothpick! We’ll make you balloon up to an impressive size and then you’ll keep growing everyday more muscular stronger!” Peter said<br />
“Ryan, you’ll be the most powerful being on Earth, physically speaking, there’s virtually anything you can’t do, just depends on your motivation, your muscles will be different from the rest of mankind, we’ll give you a superior body!”<br />
“And the most important thing, you’ll be like that forever, Ryan, not me nor Ty, neither the both of us together will be able to change you back!” Peter added.<br />
“The thing is, are you ready to take the power? You will be the most powerful man on earth, you’ll have to protect those who are smaller than you, you cannot hurt those who are innocent and only use your muscles if it don’t harm other people okay?” They asked together inside Ryan’s mind.<br />
The huge 7’7” muscle kid looked at them seriously – “CHANGE ME!”<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty smiled and then joined hands. Dustin remained there looking at the figure of his newest little giant cousin, when it happened.<br />
The ground seemed to shake; suddenly the whole world seemed to stop. When Ty and Peter focused on Ryan’s figure, it felt like a vortex for both of them.<br />
Ryan’s desire to become such a powerful being was so intense it literally sucked the growth vibes which emanated from Ty and Peter’s brains.<br />
The growth on the kid was rather amazing than it had been in the first time! Ryan opened his arms wide and they were already over 50 inches around. His chest ballooned, his pecs grew broader and heavier, his legs thickened with the intense energy which flowed into his powerful body. The more Ryan grew, the more he wanted to grow, and it only intensified the amount of power Ty and Peter gave him.<br />
“WHOA!” Dustin said as he looked at Ryan’s body. It was changing drastically, his arms grew longer and thicker, as well as his legs which seemed to be lengthening as well, his waist was becoming abnormally narrow, while his shoulders grew rounder and broader at insane pace. The size of his biceps were so much bigger, it seemed almost too big for his body! The power his neck showed was inhuman, titanic proportions.<br />
Ty and Peter never felt like that before – It was at the same time, uncomfortable and interesting, the more power they gave to Ryan, the more he made them give him, and so they kept feeding the power of the behemoth kid like a newborn star, his new mass spread his presence around, and even Dustin could feel his body heat.<br />
Ryan kept his eyes closed, he didn’t see his chest becoming so thick, his hands now were almost three feet wide, and each finger was so much big and powerful, it was thicker than any bodybuilder’s biceps.<br />
His feet grew insanely huge, as his stature augmented more and more. The size of his shoulders and the power his guns irradiated were so impressive that Dustin felt himself being afraid of the power that kid was developing thanks to the uncanny powers of Peter and Ty.<br />
Meanwhile, Ty and Peter kept enlarging the kid like they were born to do it. They had this big smile on their faces and their closed eyes showed that they were enjoying that transformation.<br />
Dustin noticed that Ryan’s size was now gargantuan, he had to be over 9 feet tall but his muscles were now uncanny and immensely  powerful, and he kept growing and growing, but to each inch he gained in height, he gained over 100 pounds in muscle! Soon, he seemed to be lacking in height to accommodate such muscular mass!<br />
“Ty! Peter! Are you okay?” Dustin asked and the magical duo just nodded, they wanted to keep growing Ryan, making bigger and bigger!<br />
It was then a powerful light flashed, like a new star, a new MUSCLE GOD was brought into this humble world! Ty and Peter allowed their final enlarging powers into the body of the kid, and the impact was powerful, Dustin just felt the impact after he was sent over 100 feet away. The entire court was covered in what seemed to be stardust, Dustin rubbed his eyes and watched the muscle vortex finally entering into Ryan’s heart, fading away.<br />
And so, Ryan emerged from the muscle vortex, exuberant, magnificent, marvelous!<br />
Ty and Peter almost collapsed on the floor as they finally felt their work was complete now, but they felt two HUGE hands keeping them from falling on the ground.<br />
“LITTLE BROTHER, LITTLE COUSIN, ARE YOU OKAY?”<br />
Ryan asked worried with his new siblings. He checked on them, noticing they were just tired, exhausted from their last work. Each one laid in one hand, and he just accommodated them on his shoulder, and looked around, and saw Dustin 100 feet away.<br />
Dustin never saw Ryan coming, when he noticed he was already being lifted by the enormous kid.<br />
Really enormous! Ryan was now 10’5” tall, but his muscles were abnormally and freaking overdeveloped, he could destroy one entire arm with just one blow.<br />
“DUSTIN ARE YOU OKAY?” The voice was deep and powerful, but you could tell it belonged to a boy, the most powerful boy ever, but still a boy, with all the sweetness and the tenderness the boys have.<br />
“S-sure, cousin – “Dustin noticed he called Ryan cousin for the first time – “Are you happy?”<br />
Ryan looked at his body, his titanic proportions, his uncanny muscles and his new POWER! “YEAH! I LOVE IT! I AM A NEW HERO!”<br />
Dustin smiled and noticed Ty and Peter coming along. Ryan walked back home and soon they were in the front yard. <br />
Ryan gently placed his cousins and his brother on the ground. <br />
Peter and Ty were shocked at how much POWER this boy irradiated.<br />
“YOU TWO ARE AWESOME! I PROMISSE YOU’LL NEVER REGRET!”<br />
“I know I won’t bro! that’s why you keep growing every day, more muscular an powerful! Congratulations little brother, you’re the most powerful being on the planet!”<br />
“No, Peter, you and Ty are the most powerful, you gave me the power!”<br />
Peter and Ty blushed, they smiled as they realized that Ryan remained still a shy kid, with a noble heart and now imperial muscles.<br />
Ryan was now 10’5” tall weighing 5850 pounds of incredibly dense muscles – His chest read 355 inches around, and his uncanny arms were 325 inches each one, his legs were 340 inches, he has 16 pack abdomen, his shoulders are 8’3” inches apart, and since his waist is only 40 inches around, his figure is pure POWER.<br />
Even his beautiful boyish face remained that way, but now his beauty was even increased, the jaw became square and powerful, and now Ryan had two incredibly beautiful emerald green eyes, which shone with his new glorious power.<br />
“CAN WE HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT NOW? I AM STARVING!” Ryan said as he tried to enter the house, he got stuck on the front door.<br />
They laughed but they were soon to be regret – “DON’T LAUGH AT ME!” Ryan said a little uncomfortable and he slightly moved his shoulder and suddenly the entire front part of Ty’s house literally blew. Ryan destroyed a major part of the building and he didn’t even moved his shoulder.<br />
Ryan noticed his mistake and he hurried to protect his beloved siblings.<br />
When the dust cloud calmed down, Ryan used his body to protect Ty, Peter and Dustin.<br />
“Are you okay?” He asked with a low voice. “I am sorry, so sorry, I didn’t mean to…”<br />
“Ryan calm down, brother! You’re a kid, the most powerful kid, but still a kid!” Peter comforted him.<br />
“Yes, you’ll learn with that, always think twice before using your muscles! You have no idea the power we gave you!” Ty added.<br />
“Besides, those two can put the house like new in no time!” Dustin said as he caressed Ryan’s cheeks.<br />
“You’ll be so proud of me!” Ryan said as he lifted his three siblings, his brand new family and watched as the destructed parts almost instantly were back at their places.<br />
The house, however, grew bigger and roomier, a huge house with a 20 feet tall 15 feet wide door. The house was now almost a building.<br />
“A bigger house for a bigger cousin!” Ty said as he showed the interior for his cousin.<br />
Ryan smiled and carried all of them inside.<br />
“LET’S PARTY! I AM STARVING! I AM LOVING BEING THIS BIG, LITTLE BROTHERS!”</p>
