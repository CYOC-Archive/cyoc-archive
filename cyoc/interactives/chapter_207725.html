<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey.” A sexy voice purred.<br />
<br />
Russ groaned, head throbbing. What the hell had just happened? He’d been jerking off in the alley way and then BLAM! He was on the asphalt, unconscious.<br />
<br />
“Hey…Ross, was it? Are you okay?” The sexy voice seemed concerned<br />
<br />
Russ woke up and found himself staring into the big, emerald green eyes of the cute young cat morph he’d been bullying an hour ago. Why had he done that again? His midnight black fur was so long and soft…He groaned again, the young cat helping him to his feet. He put a clawed hand out against the brick wall of the alley to keep himself balanced. <br />
<br />
“Wha-what happen’?” His mouth wasn’t working right, like his teeth were too big or his tongue was all wrong.<br />
<br />
“I think you, uh…got jumped.” The cat said and held out a furry paw. “I’m Eren.”<br />
<br />
The rat stared at the paw…then shook it. “Russ.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” The cat grimaced. “You look like a Ross.”<br />
<br />
Ross blinked in confusion. He’d been sure it was Russ, but since the cat had insisted…he wasn’t so sure now. Why did he want to agree with whatever the cat was saying? Heh, probably because Eren was making his tiny dick throb meekly in his sheathe. Thank god his huge balls more than made up for that deficiency. <br />
<br />
“I guess I’m Ross, then?” The rat’s voice was higher than when he’d been human, squeakier. “As long as you want me to be, cutie.”<br />
<br />
Eren smiled, hearing the rodent’s high voice. He thought the rat was rather cute, too. He took Ross by his furless hand and helped him back down the alley. The rat’s little hand-beans were so nice to rub. Butterflies were fluttering his stomach as he stared down into the rodent’s beady black eyes, rough tongue licking his lips. The rat’s nose twitched cutely.<br />
<br />
“Do you remember where you live?” Eren asked gently, rubbing the gray fur on Ross’s arm.<br />
<br />
There were no forms of ID in the rat’s pocket. He’d checked. No cellphone either. Someone had obviously robbed him. That was why anthros needed to stick together and not discriminate base on species. Humans might find rats gross, but Eren…well, the rat was lithely muscular. Bottom heavy, just the way he liked it, big hips.<br />
<br />
The rat nuzzled into his rescuer’s lush black fur and sniffed his scent. It was feline and set his rodent heart pounding…and made his tiny cock rise from its sheathe. Eren’s nostrils flared, scenting the rat’s arousal, and he gently pet the back of the rat’s neck. They embraced and Eren found himself bending down and kissing Ross. His paws ran down the rat’s spine and scratched the base of the rodent’s scaley tail, which lifted and flipped to the side as though he were in heat.<br />
<br />
“You’re a bottom?” Eren asked, voice soft.<br />
<br />
Ross just nodded, not sure what Eren meant until he felt a pinch on his rear and flinched. His exposed pucker quivered in need. A dribble of precum trickled from the tip of his tiny penis as he stared up into the handsome cat’s voluminous eyes.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah.” Ross moaned.<br />
<br />
“You wanna come back to my place? I’ve got games and stuff.” Eren smiled down at the little submissive rat twink, finger prodding the rat’s entrance.<br />
<br />
“I-I’d like that very much.” Ross said, melting into the cat’s more athletic arms and shuddering as the digit entered him, knuckling his love spot. More pre slicked the fur of his balls and thighs.<br />
<br />
The new couple walked out of the alley and set off for the cat’s house.<br />
<br />
From the edge of the alley, Gio smirked and tapped something into the computer, altering the kid’s first name to Ross. It would be updated for all official records. It was no coincidence the young cat had found the rat in the alley. Gio had sent a fake text from the bully asking for help. The cat had a good heart, so he set the dampener he’d reverse pickpocket-ed into the kid’s pocket to make sure the rat accepted anything the cat told him without question.<br />
<br />
Did he have to do this? No. But he enjoyed it. Now it was up to Zeke to take care of the kid’s family. Probably a bunch of drunks, by the way the kid acted.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Dennis was a large, muscular lion morph and he was currently training a newbie, Billy. Billy was a big and rather dumb rhinoceros morph. That was fine. Sometimes you needed muscle to deal with disgruntled…clients, as Anthro Renovations called them. <br />
<br />
They were emergency cleaners. Someone wander out of the radius of the dampeners before they fully changed? Call them.<br />
<br />
His phone vibrated.<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Dennis grunted.<br />
<br />
“Got a kid lives out on the outskirts of town. Completely outside the range of our dampeners. He’s taken care of, but I need you to deal with the family. Gio’s sending you the relevant information now.”<br />
<br />
Dennis waited while his in-vehicle monitor on the dash gave him all the information he needed. They had something rather like a police computer, able to search up driver’s licenses and other private records. They had a few friends on the force now, so getting that hookup had been easy.<br />
<br />
He punched the address into the GPS and swiftly pulled out of the parking spot they’d been idling at. Billy looked up from the veggie burger he’d been messily devouring and over at the monitor.<br />
<br />
“Oh cool! We got one?”<br />
<br />
“Settle down.” Dennis growled. <br />
<br />
He disagreed with the company policy of allowing people into the company who asked to be changed. Billy was a shining example as to why. They just didn’t take it seriously, it was a fetish for them. Sure, it was a fetish for most of them-a guy turning into a bull was a real turn on for Dennis in particular-but the newbies seemed to think it was all horny-horny fun-times. It was a fucking job and Billy needed to take it seriously or so help him god, he’d fry the rhino’s brains until the only thing he was good for would be putting up drywall.<br />
<br />
The house wasn’t a dump. It was, surprisingly, a meticulously maintained one-story with a large, well-manicured yard. There was even a nice porch swing. More importantly was the Confederate flag flying on the flagpole outside. <br />
<br />
“I won’t feel bad about this one!” Billy chuckled, pointing out the flag.<br />
<br />
Dennis frowned. Not that he necessarily disagreed with the Rhino, but…Confederate flags usually meant guns. Lots and lots of guns. Anthro Renovations usually avoided contact with people who might be volatile because…well, unless you were an expert with Dampeners like Zeke and Gio, rendering the owners…passive, shall we say, was difficult. Every renovation was different, despite what some anthros said.<br />
<br />
He checked the species Gio requested for the parents.<br />
<br />
“Get the rat pill.”<br />
<br />
“Eew, well, I guess they have it coming.” Billy giggled, unbuckled his seat-belt, and went to the back. They kept the capsule secured in the back of the truck.<br />
<br />
Billy returned and patted the front of his hi-vis vest. “Got it. What about the other parent?”<br />
<br />
“She’s dead.” Dennis said.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Billy fidgeted. “You aren’t going to be weird about this one, right?”<br />
<br />
“Just shut the fuck up and do your job!” Dennis snapped. This close to frying his ass.<br />
<br />
“Right. Pop pill capsule, smack him with the dampener. Renovate.” Billy recited.<br />
<br />
“Hopefully we’re out of there before he wakes up.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, but we have to verify faculties-”<br />
<br />
Dennis growled. “Trust me, we should leave as soon as we can.”<br />
<br />
“Pussy.” Billy mumbled.<br />
<br />
Dennis’ claws flexed and the leather on the steering wheel was ripped apart. Goddammit, second one this week. He took a calming breath and repeated his mantra. <I>Billy is gone in another day. Billy is gone in another day.</I><br />
<br />
They pulled up to the address. Big field out back, lovely gravel driveway. Someone really cared about their property. This was going to be fun…not. He got out and wheeled out the big dampener.<br />
<br />
Billy knocked.<br />
<br />
A man-shaved bald, graying goatee-opened the door and peered out at them cautiously.<br />
<br />
“Who the hell are you?”<br />
<br />
“Anthro renovations, sir!” Billy said brightly, popping the capsule under the man’s nose. “You’re Preston Eichner, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I-” The man looked down at the capsule, nose twitching as whiskers began to grow from his face. “Anthro Renovations? I do all the renovations around-”<br />
<br />
Billy pressed the personal dampener to the man’s temple. The man’s eyes shot wide open, the pupils warping from pinpricks to taking up the space of the entire eye. They stayed that way, eyes growing black and beady. He tipped over onto the floor and smacked his head hard. Preston started twitching, hips bucking as cum flooded his pants and filled the air with pheromones.<br />
<br />
Billy bent down and pressed the dampener to areas of his temple and the back of Preston’s head, the increasingly ratty man’s eyes rolling up into the back of his head. Then he abruptly went still. Billy groped his own sizeable erection as he watched man’s bulge shrink away in his jeans, barely making a bump.<br />
<br />
“Goddammit, Billy!” Dennis growled, shouldering past the rhino and stepping over the twitching rat morph as a worm-like tail slid out of the top of his loose jeans. “You’re supposed to catch them!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry boss.” Billy smirked and easily picked up the shrinking man. <br />
<br />
He set him gently on a couch  and discretely stroked the rat’s twitching cheek. Preston squeaked cutely and snuggled against the rhino’s massive gray hand, licking his lips as his incisors grew down past his lower lips. <br />
<br />
Billy checked to see if Dennis was nearby. He was in the bathroom, fiddling with the flooring there. He patted the rat’s head again and kissed the twitching nose. His thick, three-fingered hand unzipped the unconscious rat’s pants and slowly coaxed the tiny dick out of the sheathe. Pre drooled over his fingers as he lightly rubbed the tip of the rat’s tapered cock. Preston let out another little squeak and chittered happily in his sleep.<br />
<br />
“Billy!” Dennis roared, making the rhino jump. The lion was glaring at him from the bathroom doorway. “Stop molesting your unconscious victim and start with the floors! We gotta bring in stools so he can at least reach the sink. “<br />
<br />
Billy nodded sheepishly, zipping the rat up and patting his crotch gently. “Sorry little guy. Gotta get back to work.”<br />
<br />
“Fucking pervert.” Dennis mumbled as he watched the rhino leave, overalls tented.<br />
<br />
They worked quickly and smoothly. Despite his qualms about the rhino, he could at least work hard. Soon, they had coated the flooring, done proper draining, and brought in stool. He even replaced the treadmill with a big rat wheel. The place was immaculate, which surprised Dennis.<br />
<br />
And yes, Preston did have a gun. Several guns. Twelve AR15s, two shotguns, and several handguns. There was a shotgun under the new rat’s bed, fully loaded. A deer-hunting rifle sat in the corner. Even his son had guns. He noticed the man’s photos on the mantle. The woman on his arms was blonde and beautiful. He paused, then tossed it in the garbage bin. That would trigger memories and he couldn’t have that. The confederate flag was taken down and tossed in the trash. An anthro-positive flag (a paw on a field of green) was raised in its stead.<br />
<br />
Billy came back from the truck and started scattering empty beer-bottles around the rat. The rhino emptied half of one around the rat on the couch, then set it on the floor near a hand that had fallen from the couch so that it looked like he’d passed out drinking.<br />
<br />
The rat began to stir, recovering from the frying he’d just underwent. Dennis stared at him cautiously. You never knew how they would turn out until they woke up. He was hoping meek single-dad drunk loser. His phone vibrated. Zeke, using the emergency line. Damn, right at the wrong moment.<br />
<br />
“Keep him talking, go through the questions.” Dennis warned Billy. “I gotta take this.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah.” Billy waved him off.<br />
<br />
Dennis shot him a wary look, but stepped out. If he couldn&#39;t handle this, he might as well quit anyways. It just meant more work for Dennis.<br />
<br />
“Wha-what happened?” The rat’s voice was fuzzy and unfocused.<br />
<br />
“Been drinkin’ too much, old rat.” Billy grinned.<br />
<br />
The rat looked around at all the empty beer bottles and nodded. Preston looked back up at him, eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
“Who let you into my house?” The rat demanded. “Russ?”<br />
<br />
“Sir, calm down.” Billy smiled condescendingly. These guys were always so dumb and susceptible to suggestion right after a zonk. “I’m sure you can go back to day drinking when we’re done here.”<br />
<br />
“Day drinking?” The rat stared at him as if he were an idiot. “I do construction and HVAC repairs. I have two jobs you stupid fucking retard. What are you doing in my house?!”<br />
<br />
“You…do HVAC and construction work?” Billy winced. Shit. They’d just rat’d an asset. Rats were fucking useless-weak, small, submissive. He was so going to hear about this from Zeke later. “Uh, how many years?”<br />
<br />
“Twenty.” The rat blinked and wobbled on his feet. “You, uh, you don’t happen to have a space on the crew do you?”<br />
<br />
“No, no, we only accept big morphs.” Billy said, then noticed anger flare in the older rat’s eyes and quickly added. “For the heavy lifting.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you ain’t gonna hire me cause I’m a rat? Fucking bullshit! Twenty goddamn years of experience, but because I ain’t a respectable morph, I don’t get the fucking job? Is that it?”<br />
<br />
“Look, sir-”<br />
<br />
“Eat shit, sonny Jim! Eat my fucking ass-”<br />
<br />
“Sir?” Dennis walked into the room, loud voice booming. “Is there a problem?”<br />
<br />
“You think I’m going to be intimidated because you’re a lion? The fuck you think you’re going to do to me in my own home?” The rat spat at Dennis venomously. “Preen your mane in someone else’s bathroom, faggot.”<br />
<br />
“Some things never change.” Dennis muttered. Then raised his voice. “Sir, you seem agitated.”<br />
<br />
“You’re goddamn right I’m agitated. Your colleague is a speciesist piece of shit and I want him fired!”<br />
<br />
Dennis turned to Billy. “What did you do?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing!” The Rhino held up his hands. “I swear!”<br />
<br />
“I got me twenty years of construction and HVAC maintenance but because I ain’t a respectable species, I need not apply.” <br />
<br />
“Construction <I>and</I> HVAC Maintenance?” Dennis said, voice flat. <br />
<br />
Inwardly, he cursed. Zeke had just told him to change the species to something else. Dennis, of course, would have preferred bull. But the damage appeared to have been done. Maybe they could re-zonk him? No, that was a pain and a half. If they wanted to recover Preston as an asset, they’d need to bring him to the lab.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, like I was tellin’ this guy. He said you guys don’t take rats!”<br />
<br />
Dennis glared at Billy, who blanched.<br />
<br />
“I-I didn’t say no rats, boss! I said we only accepted bigger morphs!”<br />
<br />
“You oh-so-respectable morphs! You’re damn lucky discrimination laws don’t apply to anthros!” The rat was growing angrier. “I can’t get work because people hate rats!”<br />
<br />
“W-Wait, I thought you worked two jobs?” Billy asked weakly.<br />
<br />
“Dampener.” Dennis whispered. “He doesn’t remember anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Look, sir, maybe we can work something-” Billy held up his paws.<br />
<br />
“Get the fuck off my property!” The older rat kicked the dampener and cursed in pain.<br />
<br />
Billy giggled reflexively. He slapped a paw to his mouth, but it was too late. The rat glared at him murderously. Then Preston marched into his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Billy, we need to leave now.” Dennis said quietly, edging for the door. <br />
<br />
“We ain’t installed the dampener or the-”<br />
<br />
Dennis heard the tell-tale sound of a shotgun being racked.<br />
<br />
“He’s racking a shotgun!” Dennis hissed and ran.<br />
<br />
Billy and Dennis hustled out of the house, a rather angry-looking rat brandishing a shotgun following after them. The rat actually had the gall to fire at them, buckshot pelting the sides of the van, and nearly fell over backwards from the sheer force. As they drove away from the little house on the outskirts of town, the rat went back inside. The dampener flew out the door, more shotgun blasts bursting the machine apart.<br />
<br />
They took a few turns and parked near a bar by an empty lot. Dennis pulled out a cellphone and glared at Billy. <br />
<br />
“What?” Billy asked. &quot;I did what you told me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis shook his head and spoke rapidly into the phone. “Yeah, hello? This is the ECC number 4. We’ve got a big problem.” <br />
<br />
“Why not just fry him again?&quot; Billy whispered.<br />
<br />
“We DID fry him.” Dennis covered the phone and replied angrily. “That’s the problem. “ He uncovered the phone and spoke to someone on the other end. “Yes. Hi. It’s Dennis. We need to discontinue the rat line. Angry, violent and neurotic behavior. He pulled a gun.”<br />
<br />
“Why are you so frightened?” Billy asked.<br />
<br />
“We created an underclass, Billy. A very resentful underclass that has guns. You do the math.” Dennis growled, brushing his mane back behind his ears.<br />
<br />
Dennis was on the phone for the next hour.</p>
