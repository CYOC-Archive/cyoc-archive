<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha and Tammy were going to the hospital. Due not only to the fact that they were mutated, but because Tammy became a giant shark, they were unable to use public transport and were forced to walk.<br />
<br />
On the way, they realized that it had been better to walk, because the traffic was very slow. They realized that there was an outbreak of mutations and many people were going to the hospital too. They knew that Gemma had also gone to the hispital, although they didn&#39;t know what kind of mutation she had undergone, and they had no idea where Maranda was. While walking they had to stop a few times as Samantha was laying an egg approximately every 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
They were almost at the hospital when a homeless man stole a bag in which Samantha was carrying the eggs that she laid on the way and took with her, to avoid someone getting contaminated through them. She ran after the homeless person, but she couldn&#39;t run very fast with her new body and the person took advantage of the size difference to enter alleys that Tammy had a hard time getting through with her new size, what allowed him to escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, we have to find him Tammy.&quot; Samantha said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it will be easy to follow. It might be because I&#39;m partially a shark now, but I can smell his blood pretty well. He must have cut himself on the run.&quot; Tammy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, then let&#39;s go.&quot; Samanthas said<br />
<br />
Samantha followed Tammy, who actually did a good job, but  having to learn to use her sharper sense of smell it took a while to get in the right direction they should go.<br />
<br />
It took them half an hour to find the man, having to stop a few times for Samantha to lay more eggs, and then arrive at an abandoned building where they could smell the boiled eggs being cooked. Tammy couldn&#39;t enter, as she didn&#39;t fit in the doors of the building, so Samantha entered alone. The chicken girl followed the scent to a room on the second floor, where she found the man accompanied by a woman and two children who, judging by the situation, were extremely poor.<br />
<br />
The kids had some dirty dishes in front of them, which meant they had already eaten the eggs, the man had and the woman were starting to eat and had only taken the first bite when they saw Samantha walk into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I was too late. You weren&#39;t supposed to eat my eggs.&quot; Samantha said<br />
<br />
The man got up and said angrily &quot;What&#39;s the problem? It&#39;s just some eggs. You will not die from this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down dear, you don&#39;t need to be so nervous.&quot; his wife said calming him down before turning to Samantha and saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry my husband stole your eggs, but you need to understand our situation. We are very poor and we were desperate not to have anything for our children to eat. We&#39;re just eating it ourselves because your eggs are so big and yielded more than I expected, our kids have full stomachs now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I noticed, but as you can see I&#39;m a mutant because I was transformed by Mutation Liquid. I was the one who laid those eggs.&quot; Samantha said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not blind, I realized before picking up your eggs. I know that the condition is contagious through sexual fluids and that people stop being contagious after taking a certain medication.&quot; the man said<br />
<br />
&quot;But the problem is there. I changed a few hours ago and haven&#39;t taken the medicine yet. I&#39;m not sure if I can infect others through my eggs or not, so I was taking them to the hospital for testing.&quot; Samantha said<br />
<br />
The poor man and woman were frightened by the possibility that they had been contaminated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sam, did everything work out there?&quot; Tammy&#39;s face appeared in the window asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late, they already ate.&quot; Samantha said<br />
<br />
Tammy saw the poor family who lived there and said &quot;At least the kids are safe, as far as I know kids are immune.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What about us, are we going to change?&quot; the man asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but if it happens I believe it won&#39;t be long.&quot; Samantha said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no I, I... aahhh.&quot; the woman said when she felt her teeth become fangs, and her clothes tighten as she started to grow. Children, go outside. Wait with the shark woman, mom and dad will go when we&#39;re done here.&quot; she said to the children<br />
<br />
Their children were reluctant and didn&#39;t want to go, until the man, holding something behind him, said &quot;Go now. Can&#39;t you see that you&#39;re making your mother sad,&quot; With that the children stopped insisting and left the room, only then did the man release what he was hiding behind him, which revealed to be a cow&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now honey, what are we going to do? What will we become and what will become of the children?&quot; the woman said to her husband, Her clothes reached the limit and it was already possible to see a bulge in her pants, as well as a brown fur growing all over her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, first we have to see what our mutations are going to do and we&#39;ll see later.&quot; the Man said, with a bulge of a udere growing on the man&#39;s torn shirt.<br />
<br />
The woman continued to grow until she was 10 feet tall, gained a lot of body mass and her face stretched a little, brown fur covered eka completely as her new cock was erect between her legs, all visible after her clothes were destroyed and completing her transformation into a hermaphrodite anthro bear.<br />
<br />
The man had his legs fused together and covered in scales, turning into fish tail, while four huge breasts grew on his chest and a pair of horns on his head. The transformation ended with his cock and balls growing into bovine and a vagina opening below, making him a hermaphroditic cowgirl mermaid.<br />
<br />
Husband and wife look at each other in their new forms, both as horny as they&#39;ve never been before.</p>
