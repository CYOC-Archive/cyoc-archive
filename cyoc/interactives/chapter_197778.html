<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby sat up.  He was in a playpen in what was obviously a hotel room.  A boy who looked to be his current age was in the playpen with him, watching a show on the hotel room TV.  Bobby looked at the TV.  It was some little kid cartoon that normally wouldn’t interest him at all.  But for some reason, he was drawn into it.  He got up and walked over to the other boy, then sat down to watch TV as well. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the show ended.  The other boy picked up the TV remote, which was in the playpen with them for some reason, and turned the TV off.  He turned to Bobby.<br />
<br />
“I’m Jimmy.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, hi, Jimmy,” Bobby said uncertainly.  “I’m Bobby.”<br />
<br />
“I know.  Robert and Helen already filled me in on everything.”  Jimmy looked Bobby up and down.  “I’m not happy you’re wearing my favorite clothes, but I’m sure they’ll get you your own things soon enough.”  Bobby’s mouth dropped open in shock.<br />
<br />
“You- how come you talk like an adult?”<br />
<br />
“Because I used to be one.  I was a businessman in his forties when I tried to rip off Robert.”<br />
<br />
“So…you’re stuck?” Bobby asked.  Jimmy shook his head.<br />
<br />
“No.  After my punishment ran out, I didn’t want to go back to my former life.  Robert only likes being a temporary dad, so he gave me to his sister, Helen.  Helen took me in and is raising me as her own.”<br />
<br />
“How long have you been a kid?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, only a month.”  Jimmy grinned.  “It’s pretty great.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t feel that great, wearing a diaper,” Bobby muttered.<br />
<br />
“Wait, Robert put you back in diapers?” Jimmy asked.  He shook his head.  “You really caught him on a bad day, then.  Even when I was being punished, I only had to wear diapers at night.”  Jimmy stood and proudly pulled down his shorts, revealing training pants.  “Not to brag or anything, but my potty training is going pretty well.”<br />
<br />
“Good for you,” Bobby said.  Jimmy pulled his shorts back up and sat down again.<br />
<br />
“Be careful with that kind of attitude.”<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“It’s the reason I’ve got two brothers,” Jimmy said solemnly.  Bobby frowned at him, confused.  “I’m the third kid that Helen took in from Robert’s punishment.  But I’m the first one who asked for it.  Howard spent ages with Robert, but didn’t become a better person, so he refused to lift the punishment.  He was five when Helen took him in.  He’s eight now.”<br />
<br />
“And the other brother?”<br />
<br />
“Tyson actually went backwards.  No matter what Robert did, Tyson got worse and worse.  So, now he’s three months old and exclusively breastfed by Helen.”  Bobby stared at Jimmy in horror.  “Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll be fine.  Tyson was a bad person to begin with.  From what I understand, you just kinda suck.”<br />
<br />
“Has anyone other than you actually finished the punishment?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, lots of people!” Jimmy said, waving his hand.  “Robert’s been doing this for a while.  You’re actually the third cousin Bobby I’ve had since Helen took me in.”<br />
<br />
“Third cousin Bobby?”<br />
<br />
“When Robert punishes someone by turning them into a kid, he always names them Robert Jones II.  If it’s a girl, he uses Roberta Jones and just uses an I at the end of the nickname.  We get different names if we stay a kid.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.”<br />
<br />
“Anyways, since Helen and Robert are busy figuring out our accommodations, they asked me to explain the rules of your punishment to you.”  Jimmy cleared his throat. “Every time you metaphorically grow, Robert will allow you to physically grow.  At first, you’ll age a year each time you show you’ve become a better person.  If you improve faster than expected, you’ll get older by multiple years.  Basically, play your cards right, and you’ll be back to yourself by the end of the week.  Which is how long Robert’s vacation lasts.”<br />
<br />
“And if it takes longer than a week?” Bobby asked warily.<br />
<br />
“You’ll go home with Robert.  If he’s at work, you’ll be babysat or go to a daycare.”  Jimmy shrugged.  “I wouldn’t worry about it too much, honestly.  It took me longer than vacation to get my punishment lifted, and I can vouch for how good the babysitter and daycare Robert uses are.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Bobby said, nodding slowly.  “Is that all?”<br />
<br />
“Unless you have any questions.”<br />
<br />
“No, I don’t think so.”<br />
<br />
“Great!”  Jimmy turned the TV back on.  He and Bobby continued to watch kids’ cartoons for an uncertain amount of time.  Eventually, the door to the hotel room opened.  Robert and a young woman who looked like him, presumably Helen, entered.  The woman was holding a baby carrier with a sleeping baby inside, which she set down near the bed.<br />
<br />
“Did you explain everything, Jimmy?” the woman asked.  Jimmy turned off the TV.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Helen, I did.”<br />
<br />
“Great!  Then we can head to the park right away!” Helen chirped cheerfully.  She picked Jimmy up.  “Some bad news, slugger.  There’s not a lot for someone your age to do at an amusement park.”<br />
<br />
“…Oh.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry.  Howie really wanted to come here, and your grandparents like spoiling him.  But if you’re fine being a big boy while we’re at the park, there’s a lot more you can do!”<br />
<br />
“Sure!” Jimmy said cheerfully.  Helen set Jimmy down and snapped her fingers.  Jimmy promptly grew, his clothes changing to match his new age and size.  “How old am I right now?”<br />
<br />
“Seven.  When we’re at the hotel or doing things that a toddler can do, you’ll go back to three.  How does that sound?”<br />
<br />
“Sounds great,” Jimmy chirped.  Bobby looked up at Robert.<br />
<br />
“What about me?” he asked.  Robert raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Jimmy’s not being punished.  He’s allowed to get bigger temporarily to have more fun.  You’re just going to have to deal with it.”  Robert stuck a finger down the front of Bobby’s diaper, making him yelp in shock.  “Yep.  Wet.”  Robert grabbed a changing mat out of a nearby diaper bag and laid it on the floor.  Then, to Bobby’s shock, he picked Bobby up, laid him on his back on the changing mat, and proceeded to take his diaper off.<br />
<br />
“Wh- hey!” Bobby said, squirming.  Jimmy shook his head at Bobby in warning.  Remembering Tyson, the baby in the baby carrier a few feet away, Bobby stilled.  But it was too late.<br />
<br />
“You know, I was going to put you in training pants,” Robert said.  “But that kind of behavior deserves another diaper.  A thicker one.”  Bobby paled.  “After all, before, you only went number one in your pants.  That babyish behavior you just displayed, however, needs something to match.”  Robert snapped his fingers.  A diaper appeared on Bobby.  Bobby promptly began to push, grunting with effort.  A thick log slowly entered his diaper.<br />
<br />
“I warned you,” Jimmy said.  He looked at Helen.  “Can we go?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.  Public changings are a big part of your cousin’s punishment.”<br />
<br />
“There will be plenty of changings to come, Helen,” Robert said.  “You, Tyson, and Jimmy can head to the car.  Bobby and I will be there shortly.”  Helen picked up the baby carrier, took Jimmy’s hand, and then exited the hotel room.<br />
<br />
Bobby finally finished pooping.  Robert snapped his fingers.  The poopy diaper was replaced with a fresh one.<br />
<br />
“Jimmy warned you to be on your best behavior, did he?” Robert asked.  “And yet you still tried to fight against getting your dirty diaper changed.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t-” Bobby started.  Robert snapped his fingers.  A pacifier appeared in Bobby’s mouth.  He suckled on it instinctively.<br />
<br />
“I think that merits further punishment.  Clearly, being in diapers isn’t enough.  You’ll have to be…”</p>
