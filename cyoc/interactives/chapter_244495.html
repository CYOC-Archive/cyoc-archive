<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This was originally written in the year 2022. I never post it in here, until now. (Edit: I fixed most of the grammar issues but the text should be 99% the same as it was back then)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is Recon unit 001, X-331 reporting in that the landing was successful.&quot; A crocodile looking anthropomorphic xenomorph states to a radio that hangs near his mouth. &quot;The air in here is breathable on the surface and the temperature seems rather warm for a landmass mostly made out of liquids and gasses. It seems that these long green sticks are producing the air for the carbon based organisms as these long sticks sucks nearby non-air molecules inside them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The xenomorph crocodile calls himself ‘Cross’ as his birthname’s letter X resembles it. He takes his first steps on the strange land that their people dubbed the &#39;Blue Star&#39;. Cross the crocodile is a 8-feet tall massive muscular anthropomorhic crocodile with a body builder’s frame. He wears a full body latex suit that adjusts his body&#39;s temperature with nanomachines. This is Cross’s first recon mission as he has traveled inside his small space ship for decades inside a cryogenic chamber. Cross finds the Blue Star rather pleasant place and finds it appealing to look at. The nanomachines inside his suit scans everything that Cross touches and sees. They inform him that the sticks are called trees and the ground he is walking on is called soil.<br />
<br />
He uses the ship&#39;s scanner to find any signs of life. That way it would be easier for him to invade the planet if it has some intellectual life already taken over it. He spots a nearby feline inside a wooden box. He scans the wooden box and uses his translator device to mimic his speech patterns and language the humanoid cat speaks if any at all. While the translator is doing it’s job in the background Cross tries to modify the latex suit’s nanomachines to make it look similar what the feline is wearing. The scanner picks up a signal of a larger area with more intellectual lifeforms like the humanoid cat living in compact cubicals. Cross laments how primitive these people are compared to him. As a scout Cross understands the importance of data gathering and even with nanomachines feeding him with new information. Cross takes his time to research the area and the feline to make himself look convincing.<br />
<br />
Cross believes that his nanomachine suit equipped with translator device is enough to overtake anybody here. He can command the nanomachines by his own mind as they act like sentient threads of ropes that he can extend freely at any direction. Coming outside the forest Cross approaches the small cottage and knock on it’s door to alert the feline’s attention.<br />
<br />
It seems that the feline is living alone all by himself as the computer updates his brain chip. He&#39;s now capable to speak like the earth people as he chuckles at the name. Earth. It seems ‘Blue Star’-folk aren&#39;t that fancy or thoughtful when coming up with names.<br />
<br />
He approaches the house he lives at and rings the door bell. The curious feline slowly approaches the verdant and ask through a window who the crocodile is.<br />
<br />
&quot;The name&#39;s John. John Smith. I&#39;m sorry to inform you but my car broke down in the distance and I was hoping if I could ask for a pick-up truck. I can wait outside until the truck arrives if that&#39;s okay with you?&quot; Crocodile speaks as he releases a small batch of nanobots from his latex suit disguised as his t-shirt and trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well met John. Name&#39;s Bob. I&#39;m guessing you are from the big city?&quot; The feline greets him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. The Lakeside city. I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m inconveniencing you like this but would be okay if we talked for a while as my phone&#39;s battery run out as well.&quot; The xenomorph lies as the nanobots slips inside the door frame and injects themselves inside the body of the feline.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Bob falls down as his left legs goes numb.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Bob. But you could you open a door for me?&quot; The xenomorph asks from the feline as the anthropomorhic cat has hard time understanding what was going on. Bob tries to restrict his hand&#39;s movement but it is too late as he has accidentally opened the door and is now face-to-face with the crocodile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on and how are you...&quot; Bob asks as the Crocodile lifts him by his neck by his only right scaly hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here. I&#39;m going to be real with you. In next month, or so, there&#39;s going to be more people like me coming here to take over your small planet. If my calculations are correct and as your little dinky house proves me right. You people aren&#39;t as advanced as we are.&quot; Cross says as he reveals his true nature to him.<br />
<br />
Bob tries to resist him but can&#39;t as his body isn&#39;t moving like it should be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about the little bugs I had to inject inside you but I really need to test you. I think we need more native soldiers in our cause and the nanobots are telling me that your body is full of this magical thing what you call &#39;testo-stea-rone&#39; or whatever you call it.&quot; Cross explains as he carries the feline by his neck. &quot;I&#39;m making a hypothesis that my small friends here could reproduce and make you into a living factory with right settings but I need to find a way how you naturally produce it as it is store in those small dinky balls of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea what you are talking ab- AGH!&quot; Bob shrieks as his balls are touched by something lukewarm.<br />
<br />
Bob can&#39;t understand how or why but his balls feels bigger and he starts to heave air and gasp it in large chunks from his sudden horniness. His meat rod suddenly springs up as the crocodile drops him on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. That&#39;s how it&#39;s made. Water, sugar and bunch of other things.&quot; Cross laughs. &quot;Let&#39;s increase the carrying capacity size a little bit more but keep the production rate same.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the crocodile says those words a flashing images of cocks and dicks fills Bob&#39;s mind. His mind is bombarded with the things he loves and he imagines himself being carried by many muscular men. Bob&#39;s balls feel so heavy that he has to remove his pants as he finally sees his two grapefruit sized balls with a small wiener sticking out in-between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fucking shit... Those are...&quot; Bob huffs as he awes at his own massive balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we are talking.&quot; The crocodile claps his hands with excitement and lunges in front of them to inspect the two balls like apples at a supermarket. Turning and squeezing them gently.<br />
<br />
Bob can&#39;t hold himself anymore and leaks pre-cum from his dick like a broken faucet. He finds it hot that a man like John would do this to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;John... Can I call you Johnny...?&quot; Bob asks in haze of horniness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Whatever. If it makes you feel good.&quot; Cross notes as he fiddles with his suit. &quot;What if we double that size and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob screams in pleasure as the two grapefruit sized balls begin to fill in volume like two water balloons finally stopping at their melon size. Bob&#39;s vision begins to turn more and more horny as his small dick squirts semen all over the floor in steady pace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh so. That&#39;s what inside it. These small little things with tails.&quot; Cross said as he scooped some of it to it&#39;s palm and closely inspects them. The nanomachines begin to copy the Bob&#39;s ejactulated sperm DNA and as Cross prints copies of Bob&#39;s dick and balls with his nanomachines to make himself a replica of his cock in bigger size.<br />
<br />
On top of his latex suit at the crotch area he has now gained a 12-feet long cock and two fist sized balls. He is pleased as they together looks aesthetically good on him.<br />
<br />
Cross then flips Bob on his stomach and lays the kitten on the floor as he is attempting to do something what he saw in Bob&#39;s horny mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute you aren&#39;t going TOOOO-!!!&quot; Bob gasps as the crocodile begins to push his replica cock inside the cat&#39;s ass cheeks. Bob coughs and moans as he feels weird that something like this is happening to him. He is a simple farmer and never in his life expected to be fucked by a body building crocodile.<br />
<br />
Cross takes a choke hold of his head and starts to steady his pace as the kitten loves the feeling how he does it. The crocodile let him breathe occasionally but the pinned down position make the feline get more weird tingling feelings he hadn&#39;t felt previously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can now see why you do this to each other.&quot; The crocodile huffs as he switches to a doggystyle. &quot;There&#39;s no downsides to this and you get a good exercise at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob is in heaven as his small dick pumps more sperm on to the floor. In a normal case he would have passed out long time ago but because of the nanomachines his sperm production is like a miniature fusion reactor making him new sperm with very little sugar and water he has in his body.<br />
<br />
Cross tries all sorts of different positions he can find in Bob&#39;s mind until the floor is flooding with his cum and Bob finally passes out of the exhaustion.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems that Blue Star folk don&#39;t have the stamina what we Xenos have, huh.&quot; Cross states and begins to fiddle with his suit&#39;s intercom.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Bob wakes up as his body swells. Gaining more muscle and becoming taller. He let out a roar as he feels full of energy and is approaching the same size as his buddy Cross is.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOAH! Those testosterone levels went out of the roof!&quot; Cross gasps as he makes Bob have more of an athletic body with his height. &quot;Maybe we can turn your brain power into a it&#39;s minimum and make you more like a grunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sudden the athletic body begins to gain mass as Bob started to mellow down. He settles as a 9-feet tall top size heavy jock who can only think about gay sex and male genitelia. Bob has two basketball sized nuts thatr are reaching into his knees and as he acts like a total himbo slut near his fuck buddy Cross. Bob begs to be bred and asks for more cock-on-cock action from his crocodile friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. This is X-331, from the Recon unit 001 it seems that the planet Blue Star needs more preparing as they seem to have great troops for the front lines. I just need more time to learn and adapt to their lifestyle.&quot; Cross says to the intercom as he contacts to his people at nearby galaxy. &quot;Yeah... They aren&#39;t that smart but need more training. So maybe in hundred or in two hundred years I&#39;ll update you people again. Okay? Cheers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cross smiles and begins rub his hands. He has just got an approval by his superiors to do what he pleases.<br />
<br />
&quot;First I hereby declare you Bob as my personal assistant and first mate for the new retraining program&quot; Cross says as pushes Bob down and lifts his ass up in the sky. &quot;I shall call you as Build - Zero Beta. Or First-mate B-0B.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cross pushes his replica cock inside B-0B and all his fucktoy can do is to respond in moans as they keep fucking each other until the next morning.</p>
