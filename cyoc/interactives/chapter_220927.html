<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After putting on the clothes his father had given him and taking some time to come to grips with his new reality, Simon slowly walked down the steps, heading towards the kitchen. With each step down, Simon noticed how the steps groaned under his new weight. Walking into the kitchen, though, was what shocked Simon.<br />
	<br />
A massive spread of breakfast food was laid out. It included bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, fruit and even a serving bowl filled with oatmeal. Sitting at the table, Simon asked, “What’s with all of the food? I’m not that hungry.”<br />
	<br />
Laughing, “Trust me son. As soon as you swallow that first bite, you will not be able to stop until every plate is cleared.”<br />
	<br />
Simon’s father’s words proved prophetic. After his first bite, Simon could not stop himself from stuffing the food in his mouth as fast as possible. The only thing slowing him down, was Simon’s occasional need to breath. <br />
	<br />
As Simon licked the last of the plates clean, his dad cleared his throat to get Simon’s attention. “Now that your meal is finished, there are a few things that we need to talk about. Mainly what you will have to deal with over the next week.”<br />
	<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
	<br />
“Well first, you are going to need to settle on a new name.” Seeing the complete confusion painted on his son’s face, “Look at yourself son. There is no way that people are going to believe that you are the same person that went into school this morning. You’ve gained close to two whole feet of height and put on over a hundred pounds and muscle. The only ones who know who you truly are, are the jocks at your school and some of the people in this town. Those that know about the changes some of the students go through.”<br />
	<br />
Sitting back and thinking over his father’s words, Simon knew that his father spoke the truth. He was now close to seven feet tall, with massive pectoral muscles, giant biceps and tree trunk like legs. Even his face was different, more square and covered in facial hair. “What about my middle name, Zach?”<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
For the first so many weeks in his jock life, Zach, or as people quickly started calling him Z, had a difficult time. Not only did Z have some difficulty becoming accustom to his new size, but he was also worried that he would continue to grow. His dad assured Z that after the first day the changes would stop, but Z was not able to stop himself from having a few more adventures with the bear bottle between his legs and ended growing a little more, ending up standing almost seven and a half feet in the end.<br />
 	<br />
Another problem was all of his dad’s clothes he had to wear were too small, which caused a few eyebrows to rise when not at home. Since he was taller then his father, Simon could only wear gym short. Thankfully, Z’s dad gave him some new boxers to wear, the only article that he ended up wearing to bed.<br />
<br />
For shirts, the only garments that would fit his huge frame were tank tops. This meant that when he raised his hand in class, the smell from his pits was fully released, something he tried to fix by putting on deodorant twice a day.<br />
The clothes that Z ended up getting included jeans, athletic clothes, boxers, jockstraps, tank tops and a few other necessary things. his father was surprised when Z struck with the tank tops, but explaining, “I don’t want pit stains on all of my shirts. By only wearing these when I exercise, I will at least not be constantly walking around with yellowed shirts.”<br />
<br />
“You know that this will leave you with all of that muscle on full display?”<br />
<br />
“Why should that matter?” Z asked, but only received a shrug and shake of his father’s head.<br />
<br />
Z also was having difficulty with his new beard. Many of the store razers could not deal with the thick scruff on his face, and since Z’s father was not rolling in the dough, this left Simon with a decision. He could either try to shave three times a day, or he could let his beard grown and just keep it trimmed closed to his face. For about a week, Z tried to keep a clean-shaven face, he would shave in the morning, then during lunch, go to the locker rooms and shave again, and finally shave before going to bed. But eventually, Z gave up and just started trimming his beard back every morning. However, this did not stop Z from complaining to his dad about how much it itched the first week.<br />
About a week after Z settled on keeping his beard his dad laughing said, “You know son, if you let your hair and beard grow out, you might be mistaken for a Viking warrior.”<br />
<br />
“Very funny dad, ha ha.” But the comment left a seed planted in Z’s mind.<br />
	<br />
The next issue that Z faced was joining the football team. First and foremost, Z did not know how to play the game. He knew the rules, having been forced to watch with his father, but he never knew how hard it was to learn the correct forms of tackling, or the different plays he would need to execute. The first few days, Z earned more then a few laughs as he tried to imitate his teammates. Though unbeknownst to Zach, the coach was very impressed with how quickly he was learning.<br />
His second football issue, though, was not something he could get over with practice. While Mark had wanted a mindless lineman for the team, Zach had become the new wide receiver. Mark had wanted someone dumb and easy to control. Mark eventually got over this, but Z never felt he could completely trust Mark. <br />
<br />
On top of all of this was learning how to exercise so he wouldn’t hurt himself, thus losing his place on the team. The first day in the gym, Zach could not help looking like a lost puppy when observing the other guys using the weights, so he got on the treadmill and started jogging. After doing the same thing for three days straight, Zach was approached by Greg, the tight end, and Greg lead him through the basics, showing Zach the exercises, he would need and the correct form for each one.<br />
<br />
Other problems that Z was running into was how people in school now treated him. Most of his old friends did not want to spend time with Z. Because Zach hung out with the football team a great deal, they did not want the other players to pick on them. At first Z was disappointed, but he started to think that his old friends were also limp dicks for being so intimidated. <br />
<br />
Another problem, which was quickly remedied, though had been an issue at the beginning, with the many girls who now wanted his attention. Within just a week, Zach had been on three dates. While he knew that the first two dates were expecting a night of action, it was only on the third date that he could not resist anymore and found out just how much pleasure he caused when ramming his giant cock into a girl’s waiting pussy.</p>
