<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley didn&#39;t know what had happened.  One minute, he&#39;d been sitting on a bench at the shopping center, thinking about the bombshell his girlfriend had dropped in his lap earlier that day.  The next, he was laying on the floor, wearing an oversized shirt.<br />
<br />
I mean, he was suddenly topless, wearing jeans far too big for him.  Except both were true.  There was chaos throughout the building as several other people became aware of transformations.  Riley looked at &#39;Riley&#39; as...she...stood up, her shirt and jacket hanging on her like a dress.  The other Riley was a very pretty girl.  His features, but more delicate and feminine.  She had short sandy blonde hair, longer than his had been, but only by a few inches.  He looked down, seeing both a pair of A cup breasts and his now tiny arms and hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...this can&#39;t be...&quot;  The other girl put her hand on his mouth.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Shh.  Freaking out isn&#39;t going to help.  It&#39;s STS.  Here.&quot;  She took off their jacket.  &quot;Cover up.  Those jeans are going to be useless anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley put on his jacket, zipping it up.  She slid off her jeans, her shoes had already fallen to the floor.  Everything looked so much larger.  She stood up next to her &#39;twin&#39;.  &quot;So what are we going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try and slip out if we can and get to the car.  We can figure out the next move then.  It&#39;s just like that game Shadow likes so much.&quot;  Shadow was..had been...their girlfriend.  She&#39;d shared their love for adventure games and RPG&#39;s.  Last month, she&#39;d bought some indie game on Steam called &quot;Transformed!&quot;.  Basically in the game, you made a character, and during the prologue, you were afflicted by STS, and given a random mutation.  From there, it was a simulation where you tried to figure out what had happened to you, if you&#39;d gained new abilities, how to survive, and how to avoid race supremacists and mad scientists who wanted to dissect you.<br />
<br />
While the premise had been...odd...Riley had been attracted to the survival horror elements.  There&#39;d been talk of making the sequel into an MMO.  None of which mattered now, save that Riley had a little practical experience to draw on.<br />
<br />
The girls entered a side door that said &quot;PERSONNEL ONLY&quot;.  They&#39;d worked at a mall a couple of years back, and they knew that corridors ran behind all the stores, and, for practical reasons, there were service elevators hidden from the public.  Those were normally off limits, but in the confusion, it wasn&#39;t hard to use one to get to the parking garage.  Of course, once they got to their trusty old Chevy Nova and climbed in, they met their next hurdle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, my legs won&#39;t reach the pedals.&quot;  Riley groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could one of us, you know, work the pedals while the other drives?&quot;  Her other suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, I don&#39;t know.  In this town?  We&#39;d get murdered in traffic.  We might have to get an Uber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and that&#39;s not going to be suspicious.  We look like kids!&quot;  In truth, they weren&#39;t any younger than their 18 years of age, but as Riley had pointed out, they looked more like 13 year olds.  Very attractive 13 year olds, but still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and we&#39;re basically naked.  Someone is going to rape us.&quot;  Riley slumped forward, her head hitting the steering wheel with a *thump*.  &quot;We&#39;re fucked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, worst case scenario, we tell the truth.  We might get delayed for a bit by the cops, but we haven&#39;t committed any crimes.  What&#39;s the worst thing that could happen, we die of embarrassment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man.  What would our old man think?  We&#39;re girls!&quot;  Riley moaned.  &quot;Hey...uh...what do we call each other?  I mean, Riley is a girl&#39;s name too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As if anyone ever let us forget that growing up.  But yeah, that works.  Uh, our middle name is Aaron.  What about &#39;Erin&#39; with an E?&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley snickered.  &quot;Wo de ai ren?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, or you get to be Erin.&quot; Erin glared at her &#39;sister&#39;.<br />
<br />
Riley put up her hands in surrender.  &quot;Shutting up, Sir.  Seriously...why aren&#39;t we freaking out more?  I mean, we&#39;re seriously freaking, but I think we should be in worse shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like crying, helpless little girls?&quot;  Erin frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.  Even now, we can&#39;t get away from Dad&#39;s misogyny.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad is a sociopath and psychologically abusive.  We know this.  Even this&quot; she gestured to her body &quot;can&#39;t fuck us up worse than he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.  I almost want to thank him.  But..&quot;  Riley smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d rather see him burn in hell.&quot;  Erin finished.  &quot;Hey, we can do the twin thing, that&#39;s kind of cute.  Man.  We&#39;re cute.  That&#39;s fucked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But kind of cool.  Hey, we should call Shadow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t we, you know, mad at her?&quot;  Erin gave Riley a sideways glance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not mad.  I mean, come on, we love her.  We&#39;re going to support her.  It just hurts.  But she&#39;s always been there for us, and at the very least, she owes us a big favor or three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...funny.  She broke up with us because we&#39;re guys...well, a guy.  Now look at us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very doubtful that she&#39;d take us back, Erin.  I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s already got someone she&#39;s interested in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
That morning, Riley&#39;s girlfriend of several years had admitted she had come to the realization she was a lesbian.  And as much as she loved Riley, she couldn&#39;t go on living a lie.  He hadn&#39;t reacted well to her desire to stay friends.<br />
<br />
Because Riley had a secret.  In his jacket pocket, in a box, was his grandmother&#39;s wedding ring.  Their Dad had hocked it, but after a long search, he&#39;d found it.  And he&#39;d wanted to give it to Shadow.<br />
<br />
That dream was dead and dust, now.  Time to move on.<br />
<br />
They texted Shadow.  She tried to call them, but Riley refused to answer.  &quot;It has to be text only for now.  Something has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG, were you in an accident?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of.  You&#39;re going to freak out when you see us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please come here.  You&#39;re our only hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two hours later, Shadow&#39;s Chevette parked next to them.  Erin rolled down the window as she got out.  &quot;Hey Shadow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes bugged out.  &quot;What the fuck?  Who...are....you...&quot;  Her voice trailed off.  After all, she was pretty sure Riley didn&#39;t have a secret twin sister.  <br />
<br />
Erin opened the door, sliding over to straddle the center console.  &quot;Get in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shadow got in, and saw the both of them.  &quot;I...Riley?&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley raised her hand.  &quot;Yo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin raised her hand.  &quot;Sorry about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You both can&#39;t be...oh my God.  STS?  Seriously?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid so.  It just happened today.  One minute I&#39;m sitting on a bench, the next, I&#39;m a girl.  Two girls.&quot;  Riley shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;We called you because...we don&#39;t know what to do.  We&#39;ve been trying hard not to freak out, but...&quot;  Erin wasn&#39;t able to complete her sentence as Shadow pulled her into a hug.  Shadow looked up at Riley.  &quot;C&#39;mere.&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt...good...to be in her arms.  It felt like...love.<br />
<br />
Of course, their relationship had changed.  There was, in fact, a girl Shadow was serious about starting a relationship with, a girl named London, of all things.  And, well, there was the fact that the twins did look pretty young.<br />
<br />
Eventually they found a new normal.  Shadow became their big sister, and it turned out London was a great girl, so they were happy for her.  They all moved into a house together (putting their aid money to good use).  Riley and Erin started thinking about college.  They weren&#39;t actually going to get any bigger (and also, as it turns out their particular brand of STS usually came with both &#39;twins&#39; aging at about half normal rate), so they might as well bite the bullet.  London proved to have a major fetish for cute things, and as she wanted to be a fashion designer, was constantly forcing the twins to wear ridiculously cute dresses.<br />
<br />
But Riley and Erin found they didn&#39;t mind that.  In fact, they kind of liked modeling for London, and so they were able to help her get her enterprise off the ground.<br />
<br />
And when London mentioned wanting to marry Shadow, well, Riley still had that ring.  Of course, the minute Shadow saw it, she broke down in tears.  She knew what it was, and what it had meant.  But it only made their friendship stronger.<br />
<br />
And at the wedding, well, there were two Maids of Honor (even though Erin argued she should be London&#39;s Best Man).  There was only one tiny hitch in their new lives.<br />
<br />
When Teri had made her wish, she&#39;d specifically made them both cute lesbians.  Now, granted, as a previously hetero- guy, that wasn&#39;t really a problem.  But it turned out that they both suffered from an insane libido.  And, well, it wasn&#39;t really that easy to get a hot date when you look like somebody&#39;s cute kid sister.<br />
<br />
And the idea of having sex with each other was just...too weird.  Then one day, they both received an unexpected answer...</p>
