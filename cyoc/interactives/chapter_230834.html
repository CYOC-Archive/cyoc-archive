<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days later, Kelly&#39;s male clone having already evaporated, she received a call from Mia, a friend of hers who was with her when she awakened her special ability.  The girl was desperate saying she was in danger and Kelly needed to run to her house to save her urgently.<br />
<br />
The girl ran to her friend&#39;s house as fast as she could and, when she got there, she found the front door ajar and no sound coming from inside.  Entering, Kelly was faced with a scene that made her despair, a huge pool of blood at the foot of the stairs to the upper floor and only Mia&#39;s head was lying there, dirty with blood, there was no sign of her body anywhere. She fell to her knees in despair.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Kelly heard laughter and, looking for the source, she saw that it was Mia&#39;s disembodied head who was laughing as she looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fell right into my prank, that&#39;s so funny.&quot; Mia said<br />
<br />
Shocked by the development, Kelly couldn&#39;t form a coherent sentence to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be like this, I&#39;m fine.  It turns out that I ended up awakening a special power too.  Now I can freely separate parts of my body, you see.&quot; Mia said and soon footsteps could be heard, Kelly looked and saw her friend&#39;s headless body coming down the stairs &quot;I couldn&#39;t resist preparing this prank, and this fake blood I made helped a lot with the role play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t funny at all.&quot; Kelly said making a sullen face<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get mad.  Think on the positive side, now we both have special powers and my power is useful for me as I always liked assembling and disassembling my toys.&quot; Mia said as her headless body reached down to pick up her head.<br />
<br />
Next, Mia invited Kelly to wait for her in her room while she cleaned the fake blood from the floor and her head, saying that apparently she couldn&#39;t reattach part of her body if there was any impurity on the surface of the place, demanding that she she cleaned it well before putting her parts back in place.<br />
<br />
While waiting in the room, Kelly felt happy that her friend had awakened a special power too, but she was still angry because of her prank and wanted to get back. She wanted something that Mia would never forget and couldn&#39;t ignore, so she had an idea and went with the plan. Kelly lifted her blouse to produce a new clone, which practically crawled out of her belly, but this one had a glaring difference being the huge dick between her legs, which flaccid was practically the size of her leg, and heavy balls of her the size of basketballs hanging underneath. Before Mia could return, and from the copied memories knowing what to do, dickgirl Kelly left and hid in her friend&#39;s parents&#39; room, at the same time the original Kelly maintained her connection with her clone.<br />
<br />
After Amy arrived in her room, clean and with her head placed back between her shoulders, she started talking and telling Kelly everything about her power. She said that it had been a few weeks since her power had first manifested, which was when she stretched after waking up one night, but the fingers on her hands came off from the rest of her hand when she stretched them. When Kelly questioned why she didn&#39;t say anything sooner, she said it was because she wanted to better understand her power before sharing.<br />
<br />
Without Mia noticing, as soon as she entered the room and, with the habit of leaving the door open when she believed no one else was home, dickgirl Kelly had positioned herself in the hallway, where she masturbated outside the room without being perceived by the owner of the house.<br />
<br />
Kelly needed to control herself, because with her senses connected she felt all the stimulation from her clone. Only when she felt like she was going to cum did dickgirl Kelly jump into the room, aiming her four foot hard cock towards Mia and cumming right away. <br />
<br />
Mia was taken so completely by surprise by the intrusion that, before she had understood what was happening, a torrent of cum hit her face, with each loaded shot covering more and more of her body in white. The original Kelly also came and, even during her orgasm, she managed to go next to her friend, also being covered by her clone&#39;s cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is she?&quot; Mia asked when the torrent of cum stopped and she managed to clean her face enough to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you forgotten what my special ability is?  She&#39;s my clone.&quot; original Kelly said<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I thought you could only create perfect copies of yourself.  Why does she have such a huge dick?&quot; Mia said<br />
<br />
Kelly told the discovery about her power that she had recently made while the two were taking a shower together.  Mia was impressed and the two played with their powers. In these games, Mia discovered that blades in her hands acted as part of her use of power, making it impossible for her to hurt anyone, but she could undo parts of other people&#39;s bodies using blades to cut them. They also explored the different clones that Kelly could produce, seeing that she could be partially or completely animal, as well as have extra body parts or completely different anatomy, including the creation of monsters. Kelly could even create clones of herself that were partially or completely inanimate objects.<br />
<br />
They got so excited that when Mia&#39;s parents got home, there were so many Kellys that there was no more room for them to enter the house. The girls were scolded by Mia&#39;s parents and Kelly&#39;s parents, who had been called, not to abuse their abilities.  It was decided after that that they would be transferred to a school for students with powers, so that they could learn not to abuse their powers.</p>
