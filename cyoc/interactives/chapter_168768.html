<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke and his three new heads were taken with their shared body. It was so wide, so weird...and yet, so &quot;comfortable &quot;.<br />
<br />
Luke decided to give his heads some names so as to avoid confusion. After some thought and a little debate, the heads were--from their lefthand side to their right--Leo, Lewis, Logan, and Luke, though all the heads still felt somewhat like Luke.<br />
<br />
Then, the doorbell rang. Luke and his body bros grew worried. Who could be on the other side of the door, and how would they react if they saw someone with four heads, especially if Luke and the other person knew each other? But the four of them knew that if they left the door unanswered, then the person would certainly get suspicious. They decided that they had to answer it.<br />
<br />
They made their way to the stairs and started to walk down them. The stairs were still wide enough, which they didn&#39;t have to squeeze to fit between the railings. As they made their way to the bottom, they looked through the curtains covering the windows that flanked the door. There were two, and they were roughly the same height as Luke and his bros. As they quietly inched closer, they tried to eavesdrop on any conservation that could be taking place outside. At first, they heard no voices; but when they were roughly four feet from the door, they finally heard something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think Luke&#39;s home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He must be by now, Max. Maybe he&#39;s in the bathroom or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke recognized the voices as those of Mark and Max, twin brothers and some of his best friends who lived across the streets. Their two families had been friends for years, especially their dads. Mark and Max also had a brother named Zack who was a few years younger, but it didn&#39;t seem like he was there with them.<br />
<br />
Luke and his brothers turned the doorknob and flung the door open. Mark and Max greeted Luke, and were pulled inside before they realized what was standing before them. The body bros quickly shut the door, and then tried to calm the twins down. It took a while to explain what had happened and answer their questions.<br />
<br />
When everything was explained, Mark and Max were interested in their four-headed friend. More specifically, they were interested in knowing how it felt to have more than one head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Luke,&quot; asked Mark. &quot;Would you mind if Max and I tried on those clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke and his bros were both surprised and intrigued by Mark&#39;s request. Everyone in the room was curious to know what would happen if the clothes were used on more than one person, and decided to find out. Luke and his bros were about to pull their shirt off over their heads, when a package suddenly appeared on the couch. Mark opened the note attached to it and read it aloud:<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard what you said, Mark, and thought that you and Max might like this as much as Luke likes his. Enjoy.<br />
<br />
-S.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins opened the box, and pulled out an outfit almost identical to Luke&#39;s. It shared the same design, figure, and head count, but while Luke&#39;s shirt was red, this one was blue.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time, the twins got to work. Mark put his legs into the lefthand jeans leg, while Max did the same with the other. Once their legs were inside, they slipped their own pants off and pulled them out from the feet of the jeans. Then, they took off their shirts, and pulled the large blue shirt over their heads and down over their torsos. They looked similar to Luke and his bros, except the twins still had four feet, and the holes between their heads were empty.<br />
<br />
But soon enough, they began to transform as well. Their bodies began to widen, their legs began to merge, and their torsos melted together. Two lumps grew out of the empty holes, forming two new heads. When the transformation was complete, Mark and Max had merged into one body with four heads, a body very similar to Luke and his own body bros.<br />
<br />
After a first impression with their two new heads and some discussions, they decided on names. From their lefthand to their right, they were now Mark, Marty, Matt,  and Max. The two groups of body bros smiled at each other, at all eight of their heads, looking forward to spending some time as conjoined quadruplets.</p>
