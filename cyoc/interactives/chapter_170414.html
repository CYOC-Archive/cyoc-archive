<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, Brian figured, if everything has changed this much, and the jacket turned me back into a teenager, then that means most likely where I stashed the jacket is now Chase&#39;s desk area. He then decided as long as he remembered everything well, this could actually work out well for him. He was already given the knowledge of a man in his forties, and he was now a young man again. He had all the energy, strength and...capacities of a young man, and the mental abilities and knowledge of a grown man. Maybe he could even make it to the big leagues now!<br />
<br />
Brian got a rather lascivious grin on his face. This also meant he could experience all the pleasure and sex of his young adult life again. There were perks to being on the football team after all. Perks that weren&#39;t just standing and the privilege of getting to play in front of so many people at once. You got admirers, and that meant easy dates and easy wettin&#39; of the old pole. Or er, the young pole now.<br />
<br />
Brian just hoped he would not get a boner in the middle of the showers. That&#39;d be too embarrassing. But as he started to make his way to the showers and take his clothes off, what he saw made that kind of an embarrassing idea seem altogether too possible. It seemed the jacket had indeed returned him to the time he had been in his later high school life. And that meant he was back from being the rugged older man in his thirties to a gorgeous eighteen year old.<br />
<br />
As Brian almost gawked at his reflection in one of the mirrors on the walls, he consciously restrained himself from letting his jaw be slack open like he was some kind of horny idiot. Well, he was horny anyway, but no reason to be an idiot about it. His face despite his large and tall, well muscled physique was hairless aside his eyebrows and hair on his head. He remembered he had to wait till he was about 24 to get any beard hair going. His facial structure was a model-like pretty look, kissable lips and so eager looking, bright eyes.<br />
<br />
Brian was again in love with himself. He was then jarred from his stupor of narcissistic self awareness by one of the other students, not quite as well built as himself, walking in toward the shower. &quot;Hey Bri, I know you looove looking at yourself, but can you give some room for folks who just wanna get their shower in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian chuckled and went in as well, starting up one of the showers, letting it on full blast into his hair as he soaped up his body. Ohh yeah, work the soap into the abs. Want em to smell good for when a woman wants to run her hand on em at a party. Brian commented, &quot;When you&#39;re as good looking as me, you just can&#39;t stop yourself sometimes.&quot; He twisted and turned his body in the shower spray as some more of his former students current peers came in.<br />
<br />
The former coach did admit he had a really, really nice ass. Kind of made him think he could hardly blame the gay guys here at this school for holding out a torch for him. Sure he was as straight as can be, but their adoration really stoked him up nice. Would I, Brian contemplated, ever let one of em blow me if I for whatever reason had a dry spell? Things to think of. Not like I&#39;m ever gonna have such a substantial dry spell, that&#39;s for sure!<br />
<br />
By the time Eric came in, Brian almost gawked. Yeah there was no questioning it that this guy was gonna make the cut even with things changed as much as they were. Eric was gigantic, and Brian did admit he was not quite as toned as he was - but then few were - but the sheer size definitely suited him as a linebacker. His gut was substantial, but so was the rest of him... Brian found himself looking at Eric&#39;s manhood. Definitely a girlfriend pleaser, that one.<br />
<br />
Nothing weird at all about identifying it as that. After all, both Brian and Eric were guys who were on the lookout for girlfriends.<br />
<br />
Of course with the fact Brian had forty so years of experience, he was a bit better at reading the room and finding what girls liked and how to flirt better. Chalk it up to experience. Brian turned his head away and went back to showering. And then came Kyle, and Brian did admit that Kyle&#39;s build was almost as aesthetically appreciable as his own. It was really something else. He was glad he got this opportunity to go around with his former students like this. He was a teen again, he&#39;d get to appreciate all his conquests yet again, and he would even get to course correct his mistakes...<br />
<br />
But by the time the shower was over and the guys went to the lockers, Brian found himself feeling a little...odd. Even as he dried himself off, he found himself looking again at big, bulky Eric and tight, masculine Kyle. Brian had never thought of himself as homoerotically inclined, and he definitely liked women. But there was something about this atmosphere and the changes he&#39;d undergone that kept Brian&#39;s engine going strong. Maybe he just needed something to distract himself with---<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Brian, you thinking about a girlfriend?&quot; There was Kyle, and...ohh fuck. Brian was about half-hard, and it would be an awkward moment if he didn&#39;t have some form of a response ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s this girl named Melanie from my Chemistry class...you know, we got chemistry.&quot; Lame pun jokes aside, Brian found himself noticing it seemed Kyle and Eric were being a little slow with getting their clothes on. What was this? What was going on here? Were they just doing this since that happened to him to tease him or something...?<br />
<br />
Eric remarked, &quot;Well, Derek, you know Derek right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Who didn&#39;t know Derek? Even as a coach Brian had heard about the freewheeling senior. An open bisexual, Derek worked out as much as he could just for a sizable, strong physique rather than for a sports team. He&#39;d joined football at the end of the day, mostly due to some family custom related to it. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle mentioned, &quot;Well, Derek&#39;s talking about cooling off after a long day at practice over in the shower area. Says it&#39;s only healthy for the athletes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you mea---&quot; It took Brian a moment to realize what it was Derek was apparently thinking of doing, &quot;No way. He wants people to...to what? In the shower area? I mean I heard about it being done sometimes, but seriously?&quot; Brian didn&#39;t want to admit that the idea had him...curious. Derek was bisexual, but if working off was all that was gonna happen...<br />
<br />
&quot;And are you asking me...&quot; Brian paced about a little bit, &quot;If you think I might want to attend his little group whack off session?&quot; A few bashful nods. It seemed even as they were talking, Brian could see a scant few Varsity guys heading back toward the shower area. Seemed they bought the idea a little self relief was good after exertion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Brian considered it, honestly considered it. He was surprisingly very tempted. He almost wanted to go just to see who in all would be participating in this debauchery... well, as they were eighteen, no problems there. Brian went to decide...</p>
