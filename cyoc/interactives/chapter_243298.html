<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jordan and the other fusion mostly averted each other’s eyes after that. But that was easier said than done, since Katie had left both of their stall doors wide open when she walked out of the room. And they felt like they had to at least introduce themselves to each other, even if Jordan didn’t exactly enjoy the idea of making small talk with a toilet.<br />
<br />
“My name’s Alex, and I’m in the pre-med program... or, at least, I <i>was</i>,” he said despairingly. “I was gonna be a doctor...”<br />
<br />
Jordan could relate to that. She hadn’t actually settled on a major yet, herself, but the feeling that her future had just been completely blown up was very much sinking into her mind. Unless somebody figured out a way to reverse the effects of the Fusion Wave, and soon, they would both be stuck right where they were for a long time.<br />
<br />
But for the most part, they spent those long and uneventful hours feeling sorry for themselves alone, rather than trying to commiserate together. Jordan was intensely jealous of anybody who could still move, especially her former roommate - and seethed when she thought about how the chair-girl had a dorm room all to herself now. If only she’d let Katie use the shower first...<br />
<br />
But there she was, trapped inside the wall and almost completely immobile. The silence of the room, no longer interrupted by the faint sound of her own heartbeat or breathing, was maddening all by itself. What <i>really</i> drove her insane, though, was the one noise she could still hear - the faint, barely noticeable <i>drip, drip, drip</i> of her faucet, that kept coming no matter how tightly she turned her nipples to “off”. As if her fate wasn’t already bad enough, she’d already developed a leak in her plumbing. She hoped that whoever Katie brought back to help her would do something to fix that. But then she imagined some maintenance guy tinkering around with her vagina, and opening her up to get at her inner workings, and shuddered. Maybe she should leave it alone after all.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the rhythm of the dripping water started to lull Jordan to sleep. Her last thought before she went unconscious was to be thankful that she could still sleep, when all her other biological needs had disappeared. She might never taste food again, but at least she could stop being aware of her new existence for a little while.<br />
<br />
Jordan’s dreams were... confusing. In some of them, she was a normal human, her subconscious forgetting all about the fusion. But in others, she was an ordinary shower - those latent “memories” from the thing she had merged with cropping up again. Sometimes she remembered the times that her human self had used that same shower before and saw the memory from both perspectives at once. And it wasn’t lost on her wandering mind how much simpler the “life” of an inanimate object was. The shower part of her wanted to go back to that. No fears, no anxieties, no student loans for an education that might never be completed now. Just letting people clean themselves under a reliable stream of nice, warm water.<br />
<br />
The mixture of her unconscious thoughts was suddenly interrupted when she heard a loud clicking noise on the floor from someone/something stepping into the room. <i>That must be Katie</i>, she thought, wondering what had taken that girl so long. She didn’t open her eyes right away, wanting a few more minutes of sleep before she had to face reality again. The steps came closer and closer, until Jordan realized the sound was right up next to her and finally opened her eyes. And by then, it was too late. A man she didn’t recognize, bleary-eyed and probably drunk, had stepped under her head and was reaching forward to turn her on!<br />
<br />
As the warm water started to pour forward out of her mouth, Jordan’s first instinct was to turn herself off immediately and tell the guy to go use some other stall. But she knew how mortifying that would be for both of them. Wouldn’t it be easier, she thought to herself, to just let the guy take his shower, pretend she wasn’t alive, and never acknowledge it again when he was done?<br />
<br />
As the guy started to rinse out his greasy hair, Jordan looked down across his body, which was another obvious victim of the Fusion Wave. And judging by the large pair of antlers that smacked her in the face a couple times, she could guess what his story was, too. She knew that one of the bigger frats on campus here had a longstanding tradition of holding a literal “stag party” at the start of each year. They would go out in the woods and trap a particularly impressive buck, bring it back to their frat house, play with the live animal until they got bored, and then eat venison for every meal for a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
That probably explained this man’s new form, although he wasn’t quite lucky enough to be one of the so-called “anthro” fusions Jordan had heard about, who became neatly mixed creatures with full coats of fur. No, his coarse and rather foul-smelling deer pelt stuck out in random patches all over his body, making him look like he had mange. The muzzle that replaced his nose and mouth was fully deer, but the rest of his face was normal and human, which made for a pretty ugly contrast. And one of his hands had been replaced with a hoof surrounded by bare pink skin, while the other was covered in fur but still had four fingers and a thumb. Not that he seemed to notice that, though, in his intoxicated state. He was blindly fumbling at Jordan’s temperature knobs with both of them. Which quickly turned into fondling, after some kind of switch flipped in his brain and made him think he was touching a woman’s boobs. And technically he was right.<br />
<br />
Jordan tried to stay calm as the hand and the hoof cupped her curvaceous tiles, resisting the urge to heat up with pleasure. If there was ever a time to let the inanimate part of her mind take over, this would be it. And it was there, lurking in the back of her head, taking pride in how well she was doing her job. Look at how clean she was getting that fur! It hardly smelled like it belonged to a wild animal at all anymore! She wondered why she even had a sense of smell at all, with no nose. It seemed like a cruel joke to give a shower the ability to smell the filthy people who came in. And she knew that smells always smelled stronger in the shower.<br />
<br />
She didn’t really want to listen to the part of her that thought this was a normal thing to be doing. But it was better than paying attention to the way the guy’s bare abs and mottled deer penis came uncomfortably close to her sensitive lower body. Or how he soon started rubbing his cock mindlessly with his hoof, his hand still on Jordan’s “hot” breast, hooting and honking with pleasure in noises that sounded entirely animal and not human. Or how his cock spurted against her wall, covering the tiles in sticky blasts of his cum. No, she was just a shower, washing every trace of what had just happened away from both their bodies, and definitely not getting the least bit turned on by it. The gushing water that was released from her faucet-pussy was just part of her cleaning herself off.<br />
<br />
When the deer-man finally turned her water off and stepped away from her, Jordan basked in the afterglow of a job well done. But it lasted for only a moment, before he pushed open the shower curtain and left her trying to avoid eye contact with Alex again. But the toilet was already staring straight at her.<br />
<br />
“You too, huh?”, he called out to Jordan, a weak, defeated tone in his gurgling voice.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what you mean,” she replied innocently.<br />
<br />
“You know, feeling like it’s your purpose now to be a good object. I’m getting it too now. I know it sounds crazy, but as gross as it would be, there’s a part of me that’s just begging for someone to sit on my face and use me! I wonder how long it’ll be before someone actually tries it?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t... feel that way,” Jordan said slowly, trying to convince herself of that more than Alex. Yes, she had let the object side of her take over a minute ago, but she could put it away now that she wasn’t being used anymore. Couldn’t she?<br />
<br />
Alex’s porcelain eyes narrowed. Clearly it stung him to open up about something so disgusting and have her respond with a lame denial. “Oh yeah?”, he shot back. “Then why did you let that buck use you like that, huh? I <i>know</i> you know how to turn yourself off, too, ‘cuz I saw you doing it before.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, shut up!”, Jordan said. “I just didn’t want to make a scene and have him freak out on me! I just wanted to get it over with and let him get clean like a good show- um... I mean...”<br />
<br />
“Ha!”, Alex said tauntingly. “I knew it! You and I are in the same boat, whether we like it or not! And if you think- wait. What are you...”<br />
<br />
Jordan felt the water starting to trickle out of her head again. But it wasn’t pouring out of her mouth this time - it was coming from her eyes. It still shot out with the same force and pressure that her whole body was built to deliver, though. She hung her head in shame, the flexible neck bending down as far as it would go.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Jordan,” Alex offered. “I shouldn’t have...” But there wasn’t much he could do to comfort her now. She couldn’t hear him anyway - that rushing water was loud, especially when it passed straight through her head.<br />
<br />
They spent the night like that, neither one knowing how many hours had passed. For the first time in her life, Jordan wished that public restrooms had a window to the outside, so she could at least tell whether it was day or night. She wondered if she’d ever see the sun again.</p>
