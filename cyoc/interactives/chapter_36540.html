<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What... who.. who am I?&quot; Asked your former girlfriend in her new booming voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are Stephanie, my girlfriend of course! We are in a transformation room, and I changed you into the father left me years ago!&quot; You responded to her/him with a worry tone in your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... now I remember..&quot; She/he said touching his rough beard.<br />
&quot;Son. You are my son! And I'm a man! What that craziness about your girlfriend?? Who's Stephanie? My name is Steven and I AM your only lover! Or there's something new I must know?&quot; She sounded very authoritarian now, and very angry.<br />
&quot;Uh.. sorry 'dad'... I'm joking!&quot; you said for not disappoint her/him.<br />
&quot;OK, OK.. give a kiss to daddy now.&quot; You see that he was waiting. Waiting for a kiss on his furry lips! The weirdest thing was that you really want kiss HIM on his lips.. and suddenly you did. It was a long, sweet kiss, and you did'nt find weird to kiss a man. <br />
After all, it's your girlfriend, even if all that you see is that you're kissing a middle aged man who is persuaded to be your father.<br />
<br />
While you're wrapped in a loving embrace with your girlfriend/dad, he suddenly pushed you away. It wasn't a hard push, but you were still concerned as he was now holding his head. &quot;Hey, are you OK?&quot; you ask as he sits down on the bed. &quot;Uh...yes....it's just....I just got a headache honey. It's nothing to worry about. I think your dad just needs to rest for a minute.&quot; With that, you girlfriend/dad lays down on the bed, still holding his head with one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, ok, I am just going to make a phone call really quick. You just stay here and rest then&quot; you reply. You then grab your cell-phone and step out onto the balcony. It wasn't that he just had a headache that bothered you, as you had aspirin in your bag. No, he was talking just like your dad would to you. It was one thing that he looked like your dad, but now he was acting like him too? You needed to make sure nothing was wrong, so you did the only thing that made sense. You called the front desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, front desk, this is Mark, how may I help you?&quot; the voice on the other end said after you dialed the number. &quot;Uh, yes, this is room 325. I was calling with a question about 'person' changes.&quot; you started. &quot;Ah yes, room 325. I have you and your girlfriend on the list for the room. Is everything to your liking?&quot; Mark asked. &quot;Oh&quot; you respond,&quot;the room is great. I just have a question about the actual changes the room makes. You see, my girlfriend has made a change already, and she is now experiencing a headache. Also, she seems to act alot more like that person, than herself. Is this normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see&quot; Mark begins,&quot;my records show that you both are first time residents here. Allow me to explain what is happening since the others have failed to explain before you took the room. You see, the person room is a very special room that not only changes one's body, but also gives you some altered memories and traits of the person you have changed into. And by altered memories, I mean memories that are original memories of the person you change into, but still allow you to be sexually attracted to one another. An example would be, if your girlfriend changed into her best-friend, she would have memories of being her best-friend and in love with you. However, since you both are first time transformies, it should have been explained to you that your first transformation would be the most powerful, and therefore you should choose someone simple in mind, and weak in spirit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if we choose someone strong in spirit? Is there any damage to the person's mind?&quot; you ask, knowing your father's spirit is indeed much stronger than your girlfriend's. &quot;Ah, that situation&quot; Mark begins again. &quot;No need to worry. The only thing that results from this is while the person is changed, they will have no memories or recollection of who they originally were. Instead, they will completely believe that they are that person, and that all the altered memories are true. No worry though, as once the person changes back, they gain all their old memories and personality back without any problems. I must warn you though, if this is your girlfriend's first change, do not keep her changed longer than 3 days in any one form. We seemed to have had problems in the past with these first time transformations and time limits. I do not have any specifics on what happens, but our engineers have told us to relay the message to the customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot;, you begin again, trying to take in all the information. &quot;Uh, thank you for all the information. Just wanted to know there were no problems.&quot; &quot;It was my pleasure sir. And if you have anymore questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call the front desk. Good bye.&quot; And with that, the conversation was over. You put down your phone and look into the room through the glass door. The man laying on the bed isn't just your girlfriend in your dad's body anymore. The man on your bed IS you dad, both physically, and now mentally. However, if Mark was right, he also has memories of being in love with you, and maybe more.<br />
<br />
Being bold, you open the door and walk over to the bed, noticing that your dad/girlfriend is still naked. You sit down next to him and ask,&quot;Is your headache any better?&quot; He just smiles and responds,&quot;Yeah, I guess I just needed a little rest from the plane ride, but I am okay now honey.&quot; &quot;That's good to hear. I don't want you feeling bad during this vacation. After all, it's not very often we get to spend time like this together.&quot; your finish while moving very close to him.<br />
<br />
He laughs a little and then pulls your face very close to him's and says softly,&quot;Well it's not very often any father get's to spend time like this together with her son. And since this is so rare, I would never miss this over some little headache.&quot; And before you can think of anything else to say, he pulls you on top of him, and begins to kiss you deeply again. It seems whatever altered memories he had now had brought you together with your father sexually before. Not that this was a problem in anyway, as this is what you really wanted. Not just the body of your father, but his mind too was now drawing you in closers for what would be a great vacation.</p>
