<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Would just like to clarify that I did write the passage concerning Drevor claiming his name from Trevor and David two passages ago, but an internet hiccup had it not tie to my name.  I&#39;d also like to thank ChronoSeth for feedback during the writing process of this passage as well as allowing me to contribute my words and ideas to the last passage.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry my &quot;TW: Suicidal Thoughts&quot; and message went missing from that last passage I wrote.  I couldn&#39;t fix it.  I hope you weren&#39;t put off.<br/>
<br/>
TW: for Violence and Sex—but not at the same time—for this passage.  Hope you enjoy!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drevor Nicolaus Scott the Third—at least, that&#39;s what the Chronivac 4.23 calls him—stood on four legs, looking over at the woman who by twist of fate was debatably no longer legally his wife.  The anthropomorphic vixen—just one form of this kitsune—waited briefly for an explanation as to why the K9, &#39;family dog&#39;, was here when he should have been off with her husband Trevor Phillips.  In an oversight on his part, the big wolftaur lifted his hand to make a point, and realized he was still wearing Trevor&#39;s wedding ring on his now fully intact finger.  The fox-spirit knew that band, and her eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
Nearby, a dog barked.<br />
<br />
Holly Phillips had had a long night.  One filled with screams and blood, though not the same was as David and Trevor experienced a few hours earlier.  She&#39;d cured three people of cancer, helped a transgender teen get the help they so deserved, and quietly assisted a number of people with their addictions.  All in all, it had been a wondrous night of healing and charity even <i>if</i> it had started on a much lower note... her attempt to escape the clutches of her abusive husband, Trevor Phillips.<br />
<br />
In her attempts to escape him, she had taken her children as far out of town as she could while still being in range to get to her next shift at the hospital.  As far as she knew,Tommy and Alice had gotten to experience a night of fun and transformations.  David had told her so when over the phone while on break last night.  As far as she knew, their father was nowhere near them.  They were safe, and she&#39;d found calm.<br />
<br />
Now, she wasn&#39;t so sure.<br />
<br />
Emerald green fox eyes reflected a fire from my direction that did not exist in the world we had created for them.  It was, in essence, other-worldly.  Taking a whiff in through her teal-colored nose, she confirmed the scent she had picked up a moment earlier: that of Thor, Trevor&#39;s K9 partner.  Trevor was here.  Was she looking at him?  She sniffed the air, and physically tugged at the strands of connection she felt... pulling with a power she&#39;d learned of in the last few hours which bonded to him to her through their children.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s David.&quot;  The words had no inflection to indicate being a true question, and they were punctuated by upturned hands making balls of teal-colored fire which bobbed softly just above her padded palms.  The mostly white kitsune&#39;s teal colored markings of Celtic runes along her uncovered arms began to light up one at a time and hum softly, as if slowly powering a great sci-fi cannon.  At her back, her tails began to wiggle, stirring an imperceptible magical wind which to everyone else present did not exist.  Teal-colored hair, bound only by a big white ribbon right behind her head, began to wave behind her in that scentless, windless, motion of energy.<br />
<br />
When Holly began levitating a few inches off the floor, Drevor put his hands on his children&#39;s shoulders.  He stood half a foot taller than her at 6&#39;8&quot;, but he was already feeling much smaller.  Bulky muscles all through his body tensed under his winter-coat of grays and auburn fur.  Stretched across his upper torso was a white shirt with a black QR code, while over his rump were a pair of tightly-fitting dark blue gym shorts.  Otherwise, the muscular creature was essentially naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holly, honey—&quot; the wolf began, but the humanoid vixen growled at him.  The stocky wolftaur winced as his default reaction seemed to have been to channel Trevor&#39;s tone and voice which was about to be a deadly mistake if she thought Trevor had maybe <i>killed</i> David.  To him, there was nothing known on Earth stronger than Holly Phillips.  She had been transformed to magic creature, and the universe treated that as true.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m right here,&quot; he tried again, channeling David&#39;s smoother voice.  This seemed to anger her further, eyes bleeding into teal and then white energy as she growled.  She bent her right leg up slightly behind her as one foot hovered just inches off the ground.  Her body slowly wobbled in the air, a cool vexation powering her flight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kits.  I am stronger than your father has ever been, and I <i>do not</i> fear him.  Tell me what he&#39;s done with Mr. Scott, and we&#39;ll do whatever you like with daddy afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy.  Tom, sorry,&quot; Drevor fumbled his words as he whispered, his hazel-green lupine eyes locked on Holly&#39;s emerald green vulpine ones.  He raised his voice.  &quot;Little help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom swallowed hard, his eyes looking up at the man he knew was his father, unsure for just a moment too long what was being asked.  Quickly he turned to his mother who appeared to him as perhaps stronger than the dragon the boy been last night.  &quot;Mom.  This isn&#39;t dad.  I mean, it is, but—&quot;<br />
<br />
The German Shepherd shut in the next room began barking again.  Holly&#39;s fur pooffed up like an electric current had been sent through her body.  She let out a cackling set of barks towards the noise, her right hand lifting up in Thor&#39;s direction.<br />
<br />
The bigger wolf didn&#39;t know what the fox was doing, but it looked like she was about to cast a fire spell in the direction of his partner.  Quickly, Drevor was over the futon, leaving his children by the TV, his body blocking Holly&#39;s possible attack.  She yapped at him, the ball of energy that floated with each hand getting gripped like a stress-ball as she took up a martial arts stance holding her fire in her hands.  This would have been a shock to Trevor, but not to David.  He&#39;d encouraged her to seek some self defense classes, and apparently this was but a taste of the result.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not do this,&quot; Drevor said, putting his hands up.  &quot;We should talk this out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s David.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly sniffed the air again.  Many of the local energies went somewhere upstairs, but none of those were the current of connection she felt strongly with this creature.  While she recalled an energy tie between herself and her children even before she&#39;d left for work, she hadn&#39;t fully understood it then.  But that energy&#39;s path was clear now... from her to them, from them to him.  It was familial, and it meant she was definitely looking at Trevor Phillips, a big, buff wolftaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve asked you twice.  Do not make me ask a—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holly, please,&quot; Drevor&#39;s concern were so palpable the kitsune could taste it in the air.  &quot;You&#39;re going to light the house on fire... a house with our children in it and—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;David&#39;s never once called them &#39;our children&#39;—&quot; she said and made the angry quotation marks appear in the space to the sides of her head in teal like a visual from an anime as she made air quotes with her fingers, &quot;—and he&#39;d know that.  Because, unlike you, <i>I&#39;ve</i> never cheated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor allowed himself a momentary whine, his tail between his legs now.  &quot;Tommmy?&quot; the big man asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, that&#39;s David!&quot; Tommy called out.  &quot;Don&#39;t hurt him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly&#39;s glowing white eyes shifted to look toward her children, a lack of understanding clearly present in her inhuman face.  What the kit was insisting did not jive with the surety that her magic—something hours old, but now deftly experienced in—was telling her clearly: this was Trevor Phillips.<br />
<br />
Searching for a deeper context that Tommy had not meant, a low growl began to build up in her throat. More glyphs lit up over her her shoulders, burning deep within her white fur a bright teal.  Her ears flicked.  Those three tails waved behind her.  Then, slitted eyes narrowed as she found a meaning that made sense:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; she spoke loudly, deliberately.  &quot;You&#39;re saying that&#39;s David&#39;s <i>body,</i>&quot; she declared more than asked in the direction of her children.  Then, to Tommy specifically, she asked: &quot;How hard did you hit it last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holly, please.  <i>Please!</i>  I&#39;ve already died, like, three ti—&quot; but Drevor&#39;s pleading fell on deaf ears.  Suddenly Holly was gone, but not really.  She&#39;d tossed her flames so that they hovered in the air, left there where her hands and body used to be.  Beyond the enhanced vision of this wolftaur she had rushed in forward to come in low towards his upper chest.  Mentally, he hadn&#39;t seen her, but the air current she&#39;d caused hit him low in the front and nearly gave him enough time to react.  Nearly.<br />
<br />
Her back was up against his lower front, and she was already reaching up with one arm over a shoulder.  Soon enough, Drevor was upside down as his smaller mate was already flipping him overhead and onto his long back.  He was a big creature, but she&#39;d thrown him like he was nothing.  If not for the enhanced durability he&#39;d given himself a few hours ago, the impact of his legs across the ceiling struts would have broken numerous ankles and toes.<br />
<br />
He yelped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; was Alice&#39;s voice, but in Holly&#39;s mind, it was too late.  She&#39;d hit Trevor, and Trevor was going to hit her back... unless she broke him.  She actually smiled, teal lips pulling away from shining vulpine teeth.  <i>I&#39;m going to break him.</i>  David&#39;s body could take it.  If she couldn&#39;t kill him, that meant he could suffer.  Suffer like he&#39;d made her suffer.<br />
<br />
Drevor hadn&#39;t had time to react as non-burning energy of her two fox-fire orbs engulfed him.  Before he knew it, he was being mystically lifted up by Holly in a singular energy ball.  Spinning him around her body like she was a fan dancer, she threw the over four hundred pounds of monster into the flimsy, wooden door that led out the side of the basement right next to the work room where Thor was locked up.<br />
<br />
Were it not for his enhanced durability Drevor would have perhaps exploded in a comical Mortal Kombat fatality, a shower of blood and bones and two too many skulls.  Instead, the impact left him crumpled over the stone path that lead down a slope towards the main barn.  Giant slivers of door stuck out of his form randomly, and he was now bleeding from his wounds.  Those yellow-green eyes looking up just in time for the Naruto-running vixen to get right into his face as he tried to stand up on four legs.<br />
<br />
Somewhere behind them, inside, children yelled.<br />
<br />
The white and teal vixen passed by the large wolf creature and imparted <i>new pain</i> to him.  As his body was yoinked backwards, agony shot up his spine.  She&#39;s grabbed him by his overly fluffy tail and was now continuing to run at full speed, dragging him on his four legs briefly before they lost their footing and jerked out from under him.  He tumbled like furry ball on a string as the Earth became like sandpaper.<br />
<br />
This was a versus match, and she was taking him for a ride...<br />
<br />
(|[***]|)<br />
<br />
Drevor screamed as his heavily muscled body was dragged alongside the Scott family barn, parallel to the long perimeter fence, passed the lake were David sometime fed ducks, and into the woods which led towards the nature preserve.  How far was that?  Well, I&#39;m really bad at distance, but it was further than one hundred meters, which was more than double the distance of the Emitter which <i>neither</i> of these characters had on them.<br />
<br />
Much like the night before as David, Drevor could not be certain when he&#39;d &#39;woken up&#39; after passing out.  His body was crumpled against a large rock on a hillside, thick trees creating deep shadows from the sun high above.  The pain existed, but it was too much... dirt in a wound that was most of his entire right side.  He wasn&#39;t sure where he was, but he knew he was upside down on his back.  A sadly familiar feeling coarsed through his body as legs snapped back into place, blood seeping out into the earth as muscles regrew, skin reknit, and fur began to ripple to the surface in replacement to where it had been rubbed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fucking serious?&quot; came the feminine voice of his sexy wife.  His glazed over eyes turned to face her, slowly refocusing as his face finished stitching itself back together.  Splayed onto his back, she was motioning to his bright red rocket between his rear legs.  His canine cock was huge and hard, somewhere north of fifteen inches long, narrow, and pointed with a thick bulb at the bottom.  Shaking his head, he had to assume his shorts had been peeled off during the now missing time.  &quot;I always suspected you were a masochist, Trev.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.  I get it.  It&#39;s just too bad I can&#39;t keep hurting you without you enjoying it.&quot;  Putting her hands on her hips, Drevor watched as soft teal fire burned his blood off from her kimono-dress until it was like new once again.  She was hovering in the air, a ring of blue energy balls the size of billiards made a pure energy necklace which floated over her form around her neck.  &quot;Now.  Which bones should I break?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor coughed up blood.  &quot;So you&#39;re a sadist now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you, honey, I will be,&quot; she grinned, her smile traveling further than her mouth, extra teeth showing as her lips pulled back and up to her ears.<br />
<br />
Watching as his mate&#39;s body became a bit more sharp, with spikes coming from her elbows and shoulders, Drevor&#39;s eyes went wide.  &quot;I think... I made you the wrong kind of kitsune,&quot; he conceded.  Maybe she was actually a demon?  No.  No, this was anger.  This was her versus Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s David.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolftaur groaned, trying to get up onto his four feet as he limply responded: &quot;I thought you weren&#39;t going to ask me a—&quot; He hadn&#39;t seen her rush forward, but she was already there, interrupting him by squeezing his throat, lightly choking him.  &quot;Uhh... Holly.&quot;  She crushed his larynx just a bit more.  &quot;Look, we&#39;ve tried the truth.  Just tell me what lie will make you happy...&quot;<br />
<br />
The vixen sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m going to start beating you now... I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D.B.Z.A.&quot; Drevor chuckled before her grip had yanked him hard, impacting his skull against a rock.<br />
<br />
(|[***]|)<br />
<br />
Holly was worried the children would come looking for them, but they never did.  Somehow, through broken arms, bashed skulls, shattered ribs, and missing eyes, David&#39;s old QR shirt remained intact... though it looked like it had been through about two Die Hards worth of tough times, no longer white and instead kind of brown.  Brown and covered in chunks of its owner.<br />
<br />
Drevor was rock-hard.<br />
<br />
He was laying against the dirt somewhere <i>else</i> deep in the forest.  In the distance he could hear the local wolfpack howling to each other and he badly wanted to call out to them.  Through all the pain, the impact had diminished and it wasn&#39;t simply that he was enjoying it—which apparently he was—but something to do with an aging werewolf.  While he was pretty sure the only were-part of him was the regen, he had to admit that the more damage he took, the less hit hurt.  Perhaps that was a function of the specific kind of werewolf Preset he&#39;d selected.  Whatever the case, it seemed like hours ago that he&#39;d stopped screaming.  Now he was just along for the experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is boring,&quot; Holly Phillips said in a monotone.  &quot;You&#39;re boring me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wolf ears shifted toward the sound of a tree breaking.  Drevor glanced over his shoulder from where he lay sprawled to confirm that which his ears were already telling him.  Letting loose a sigh, he just laid there as one of the thickest trees in the wood fell longways across his wolftaur body, pinning him down.<br />
<br />
In an instant, she was standing atop the tree&#39;s side near to his body, looking down at him.  His eyes met her own, and they both looked equally bored.  This upset her, but it wasn&#39;t like her supernatural levels of rage could climb any higher than it already was.  Right?  &quot;Care to break the monotony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Trevor?&quot; he offered, though the words didn&#39;t feel right at all.<br />
<br />
She frowned at him.  &quot;Uh-huh.  But you&#39;ve been saying you&#39;re David.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true too,&quot; he groaned.  One of her hands went upturned and a ball of fire began glowing above it.  &quot;Not like you&#39;re thinking.  I didn&#39;t steal his body.  It was thrust upon me.&quot;  The tree was crushing him and no amount of regeneration was going to make the difference.  &quot;Tommy messed up with the Emitter.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox woman put her hands on her hips.  &quot;It&#39;s not like you to blame the children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor watched that fire in her hands as she leaned towards him.  His mind was distracted, taking in her piercing eyes, still visible behind the white glow; bust, larger than average and still framed within the front v of he kimono; lean but muscled arms, deadly and ready to strike; and those three tails which he&#39;d wish would lift for him to get under.  He groaned from the strain of his hard-on, but played if off as stressing under the weight of the tree as she leaned forward.  This was as far as he&#39;d managed to get dialog, and David was a talker.  He needed to lean into that...<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember catching Alice&#39;s heart racing... she was excited by... the adventure of transformations,&quot; he tried to start, but her whiskers twitched.  &quot;OK, wait.  Please stop hurting me,&quot; he pleaded before she&#39;d even moved further against him.  &quot;Tommy has a phobia of personal body transformation,&quot; he said.  &quot;His terror was real.  Ask Alice.  She helped me get him through it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve lost the thread,&quot; the vixen insisted, her glowing white eyes narrowing.  &quot;You&#39;re pretending to be David...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; he grumbled, tears in the corner of his eyes.  &quot;Wait, no... not fine.  This is a kitsune thing, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  He finally realized what must be happening.  &quot;You sense something with a new power or spell or something which is making you disbelieve what I&#39;m trying to say, yeah?  Please.  What is it?  I&#39;m sure I—&quot;  He remembered her actions in the basement.  &quot;Sniff!  It&#39;s a sniff.  What&#39;s making my smell seem like it&#39;s lying to you??&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat down on the log, feet dangling near his muzzle.  She moved the ball of energy across back of her fingers, knuckle-rolling it like it were a coin, debating answering the question.  Finally she sighed, and looked down at the physically bigger wolf.  &quot;I can sense familial connection... yours comes from the cubs, and theirs connects to me... the only way that works is if you&#39;re the father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can work with that,&quot; Drevor remarked grumbling underneath the tree.  &quot;So.  OK,&quot; he tried to start, wanting to use his hands, but currently unable to.  &quot;Last night, while Alice was talking with David, Tommy—now Tom—took the Emitter from David&#39;s carapace and used his computer to set up a—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;David&#39;s devices all lock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, correct.  But the Chronivac doesn&#39;t care.  It works even if the PC or USB port is busted.  Plug it into a device that accepts it, and it still brings open the app.  You... you <i>can&#39;t</i> be locked out of the Chronivac... at least in four point twenty-three.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly leaned forward, looking down at the creature.  &quot;Really?&quot; he weakly nodded.  &quot;So you can use it to get into someone&#39;s machine?  Unlock it with the Chronivac, then close the window?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno.  Wouldn&#39;t think so.  I think it just re-locks,&quot; he offered, glad to have made it three minutes without more than a constant, mild pain of being crushed.  &quot;Point being, Tom set up a Trigger.  Somehow he selected Trevor—uh, me?—by I&#39;m guessing trying to change his father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the kitsune no longer liked this story.  She growled down at him.  &quot;He thought if he made you more like David I&#39;d somehow fall back in love with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  No.  Way worse than that,&quot; Drevor conceded, his eyes looking back up at those glowing white ones from the powerful spirit-fox.  &quot;He set it up... so that when the two men came into contact...&quot; he trailed off.  He&#39;d relived the moment so many times already today.  Growling softly, he shut his eyes.  &quot;They merged!&quot; he blurted out.  Eyes reopening, he looked up at Holly again, but her looked was incredulous.  &quot;Don&#39;t believe me?  Fine.  Tom said he made me sixty-forty in David&#39;s favor... so, as a result, while I have <i>both</i> their memories, I react a bit like either of them in any one moment...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel guilty?&quot; she wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit yeah, I feel guilty!  About all kinds of things...&quot; he coughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am bored,&quot; she offered as a thought as she tilted her head to the side.  &quot;Let&#39;s play a game: can you think of something specific... something Trevor wouldn&#39;t have felt guilty about but does now because you two are together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor bit his lip.  &quot;Won&#39;t this make you <i>more</i> not <i>less</i> likely to kill me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if it&#39;s something I don&#39;t already know about...&quot;  Holly trailed off.  She scented his fear... it was becoming thicker than his arousal.  &quot;Oh, you&#39;re thinking of something specific,&quot; she realized, her hair beginning to flow in that windless wind once more.  &quot;Tell me.  Tell me, or we spend montage time breaking your body more.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolfaur&#39;s thick eyebrows went up as his eyes went wide.  He growled at himself, blurting out: &quot;He pierced the condom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly shrugged.  &quot;That doesn&#39;t really warrant your current level of fear.  I knew to take care of things on my side because I didn&#39;t trust you.&quot;  Drevor&#39;s eyes watched hers.  His own lupine eyes imparted a pleading for her to continue that thought, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself verbally encourage it.  He was afraid.  Frowning, she considered his reaction, working out the pieces aloud: &quot;I didn&#39;t trust you... because... condoms are a lot more certain than I thought at that age... so it seemed unlikely one broke when—&quot;<br />
<br />
Her word were cut short, and her hackles spiked tall at her back where the kimono showed the house crest of White.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy!?&quot; she roared, the tree getting hot over the top of his body as her hands shot downwards toward it, palms open.  &quot;You mean Tommy.  I-I-I-I&#39;m <i>married</i> to you because you got me pregnant!&quot;  He could feel teal embers licking his fur all over and while that raised his arousal, it was completely involuntary to the knowledge the vixen was going nuclear.  &quot;Our families guilt-tripped me into our marriage, and I thought they were right to!  We had a child on the way!&quot;  It looked like all the glyphs on her body were lit up now, the kimono fluttering in the wind that actually existed now.  He had a fabulous up-skirt shot all while teat was filling the area.  It was nice, but he was in serious danger.  &quot;I thought you loved me, and that we just got unlucky.  But I did the Christian thing and got hitched!&quot;<br />
<br />
She crushed the tiny ball of energy in her hand she&#39;d been knuckle-rolling.  Flames coated her left arm as she pointed at Drevor.  The tree atop him lit on fire as she roared out in wrathful horror.  No words escaped her lips, just animal sounds of barking yips, cries of a distress and pissed-off vixen... but he didn&#39;t need words any longer, because his wolf-mind was auto-translating what she kept repeating, over and over: &quot;Rape!&quot;<br />
<br />
All while Holly had been beating him up for over an hour, Drevor&#39;s mind kept worrying about one particular facet of the damage: her fox-fire.  While he hadn&#39;t read as deeply into the Werewolf Preset he&#39;d selected, specifically, he knew in general from various lores that there were a handful of ways to stop a werewolf&#39;s regeneration.  One of those ways was obviously silver, which she didn&#39;t have.  The other?  Mystically or magically empowered damage.  <i>That</i> she <i>did</i> have...<br />
<br />
Adrenaline powered him, fed by his werewolf regen, as Drevor got his palms pressed against the huge fallen oak from below.  The kitsune was still standing on it, but that didn&#39;t seem to matter.  As it budged, it burned, heating up from the inside as the fire cooked the tree.  Inches at first, then a foot... enough that he could get his front leg&#39;s hand-paws to get under the opposite side and push upwards as he four-arm, bench-pressed the giant oak.<br />
<br />
Holy would be impressed if she weren&#39;t so angry, the wolfaur lifting up the fallen tree with her still standing on it.  With a powerful thrust, he managed to kick the oak sideways enough that he could roll his whole body out from under it.  Turning to face his mate, he didn&#39;t know what to do.  But as the woods began to light up in teal flames, the wolfaur&#39;s choice was made very clear.<br />
<br />
He turned and bolted, choosing flight over fight.<br />
<br />
On paper, wolves and foxes were similar speed... but they were burst runners.  Humans were distance runners, able to run down their prey over days of stalking, tiring them out.  None or all of this applied to Drevor.  Who knew?  Running speed wasn&#39;t part of his edits, yet he moved with four-legged grace all the same.  He leapt over other downed trees, dodged fire blasts coasting over his head, and deftly turned with quick hops to go different directions.  All the while, Holly hovered behind him, keeping speed without even moving her legs.<br />
<br />
Terror filled his body from head to every toe and down to tip of tail.  He was doomed.  There was no other words, no thought.  Instincts drove the wolf as a bigger predator chased.  He bounded between raised stones, then forward flipped down a waterfall several meters downward, landing on all fours only to push off the soft shoreline just before a fireball hit barely missed doing little more than singeing his tail.<br />
<br />
He understood land traversal innately.  Terrain he&#39;d never crossed before, a ways away from any of the hiking trails, were reacted upon as if he knew where every paw needed to land.  This was different than earlier, when she had been dragging him.  It was uneven surfaces everywhere, and she had to push tree limbs out of the way to keep her eyes on him.  He was low, with powerful bursts, his muscles burning as he darted from cover to cover, blocking her shots mostly with trees as he moved.<br />
<br />
For better or worse, the kitsune had become less accurate in her anger.  However, that did mean she was lighting the woods aflane and making his escape even harder to maintain.  What felt like minutes into the chase, he found himself running between two walls of blazing teal before leaping down an embankment and swiftly lunging out of view.  It was then he took a wrong turn through a number of branches and his underbelly got yanked to the side as his throbbing, exposed manhood was jabbed by a rigid stick held between stones.  He yelped, having his cock caught and cut.  Tripping from the low impact, he tumbled to a stop.<br />
<br />
She was <i>instantly</i> up above him.<br />
<br />
The white fur of the anthro vixen flowed in power from the beyond, the teal glyphs patterned upon her lit with magical energy.  She cackled, raising her arms above her head.  &quot;You&#39;re dick really has gotten you in trouble.&quot;  Her words were English again, and she sneered.<br />
<br />
The wolftaur was panting, his cock&#39;s damage knitting itself back together as he looked up at her.  &quot;OK,&quot; he managed words between pants.  &quot;OK.  I.  I&#39;m sorry.  Trevor&#39;s sorry.  But please.  Don&#39;t.  Kill.  David.  <i>Again</i>,&quot; he managed to emphasize while trying to catch his breath.  &quot;Your flames.  Will kill.  Us.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the surrounding temperature rising, Drevor stood in a valley looking up at Holly as she floated in.  She looked around as if only seeing the world burning for the first time.  Maybe she was.  This was a wicked power trip, and she&#39;d had tunnel vision toward her prey.  Things were on fire, but nothing was truly burning.  Noting except Drevor&#39;s tail, anyway.<br />
<br />
With just a hint of teal smoke emanating from them, her glowing white eyes slowly turned to focus on the creature before her.  Her vulpine muzzle once again had a normal amount of teeth and no longer reached all the way to her ears.  Sternly and deliberately she sneered: &quot;You get one chance, monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take it!&quot; he declared in a quick bark.  &quot;Anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me how I save David,&quot; she demanded, her arms glowing in that pale teal light as she clenched her fists.<br />
<br />
As the fire fluttered all around him, he smiled.  Maybe a part of him could survive this.  &quot;That&#39;s easy,&quot; he called up to her after taking a moment to catch his breath.  &quot;You can split us.  You can make a copy from his transID.  You can reset the world twelve hours which, if I&#39;m thinking right, would be around the time Tommy was programming the Emitter to make <i>this</i>—&quot; he motioned at himself with his big meat-paws, &quot;—happen.  Lots of options,&quot; he implored, yelling over the raging fire.  &quot;Given enough time, I could think of more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why should I believe you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When have I, Drevor, ever lied to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolftaur had used the name that came to him first.  He wasn&#39;t Trevor or David but some combination of the two.  This was the first time Holly had heard it, not that she&#39;d given him much opportunity for him to speak it.  The mild confusion of pronunciation had given her mind enough of a break to finally take in her surroundings.  Her magical fire was only hot when she made it so, and though the forest was covered in it, the flames were only actively hurting Drevor.<br />
<br />
But now that she thought about it, he wasn&#39;t unlike a machine.  A biological machine.  <i>A sex machine, maybe,</i> she smirked, shaking her head as she took in the comical sight of his red prink as a color splash against his gray and auburn fur.  He wasn&#39;t fully Trevor, nor David.  But was he his own person?  If he was, what would that mean?<br />
<br />
&quot;Drevor?&quot; she asked as she held one of her flaming arms back behind her.  The fire from the chase sequence, even as far a distance away as the fallen oak, slowly flowed towards her hand as if it were a vacuum cleaner.  She licked her lips as if tasting his name on her palate.  &quot;Drevor,&quot; she repeated, her tone softened.  &quot;I almost killed the forest,&quot; she communicated as realizations started to hit her.  &quot;I almost started a fire in the house...&quot;  She shook her head, then looked back down at the wolftaur as her flames all returned to her, but still coursed up and down her arms.  &quot;If you&#39;re saying David&#39;s in you, then yes, let&#39;s get him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to be clear.  You&#39;ll kill <i>me</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly Phillips, the white kitsune with the teal-flame covered arms, just tilted her head at the creature beneath her.  &quot;Drevor?  Hm... You weren&#39;t even born yesterday.  Why should I care?  You&#39;re half Trevor, and Trevor is one hundred percent a rapist.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stocky wolftaur put his hand on his hips.  &quot;I&#39;m only forty percent Trevor... The only one hundred percent <i>I am</i> is <i>me</i>—&quot; he declared, thumbing at himself with his left hand, &quot;—and, like David, I would argue I&#39;m not a rapist.  Like you said, I&#39;m not even half a day old.&quot;  He put his hands together just in front of his muzzle.  &quot;It&#39;s sort of a fucked up situation, but that&#39;s been my whole life so far.  Birthed from horror, I get to end up half-dead, I guess.&quot;  He ran a hand through the auburn gray hair at the back of his neck.  &quot;I was basically doomed from the start, Holly.  This was never going to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor sighed, and Holly slowly lowered herself to be closer to him on the ground.  &quot;You seem pretty chill concerning your own death,&quot; she noted.<br />
<br />
The wolftaur pointed into the trees, directly at me.  &quot;Blame him,&quot; he said and Holly quickly turned to face towards the &#39;camera&#39; where she felt Drevor envisioned me.  Of course, she didn&#39;t <i>see</i> me.  Technically he didn&#39;t either... he just knew where we—you and I—watched from... he vaguely understood I was a wolftaur about his size with a flat medium gray to my fur.  &quot;Him and the purple one have basically been torturing your friend for the last few hours.  Sick fucks.&quot;  That last remark was punctuated by spitting in my direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Swear?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck no,&quot; she smirked.  &quot;Spit.  It&#39;s disgusting.  Trevor used to do it all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor shrugged, then waved his hands in front of himself.  &quot;Easy fix.  Won&#39;t happen again,&quot; he said, making note of the request.  &quot;Honestly, it&#39;s a load-off,&quot; he offered as a thought as he motioned off to his side where she might land and walk with him.  Watching him closely, the kitsune&#39;s eyes caught sight of Drevor&#39;s bright red dick once again, poking out from beneath his underbelly.  Her eyes, looked up to his face to find that his eyes met hers.  &quot;That... that seems to be stuck on at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re dripping pre everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a tiny bit horse, as you know... centaur stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she said, motioning for him to walk up the hill in the direction of the ranch.  They had been gone for a while at this point, and the bother wondered what the kids had been doing all the while.  &quot;Guess that part might be David,&quot; she smirked.  &quot;He&#39;s often been quick to rise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor shrugged.  &quot;Well, David just found out yesterday that he&#39;s pansexual, so... even though he enjoys your new ass, breasts, lips, and all that... he&#39;s most turned on by your personality, Holly.&quot;  Drevor stepped up part of the rocky incline.  &quot;He&#39;s been wondering if you were trying to make yourself look sexy for him.  He&#39;d tell you you were already sexy.&quot;  Smirking, he went on: &quot;Me... I think I enjoy it all... but the canine parts really do it for me too.&quot;  He glanced at her, but she just shook her head.  Trying to lower his wagging tail, he found it rising up for her a moment later as he thought about all the damage he took.  &quot;The pain turn-on, though... that&#39;s news to everyone in here,&quot; the wolftaur admitted, tapping his head.<br />
<br />
They reached the top of the hill after a long moment of silence and Holly finally asked something about the Drevor situation.  &quot;So... are they both talking in your head or something?  Like, are they fighting?&quot;<br />
<br />
The muscular wolftaur turned to look back towards her as she followed behind him.  &quot;No.  I mean.  I don&#39;t know how to even explain.  It&#39;s all part of the <i>style</i> of the thing.  My mental state is born from their final moments, and my mind has all seventy plus years of experiences crammed into it.  But... are they fighting, no.  It&#39;s just me... but when there&#39;s a... a <i>tie</i>, you might say, I have to try and figure out what is me, and <i>that</i> usually leans David.&quot;  He sighed.  &quot;Also, you can usually see the &#39;mental lag&#39; sometimes when I try to figure out how to respond... just stare off, thinking...&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly Phillips took a deep breath, catching his musk in the process, but also a thinner scent which made her look at his raised tail.  That cookie of his was somewhat more swollen than it had been when this whole thing started.  Shaking her head, she moved up close beside him as they walked so she wasn&#39;t as much down wind from him and his pungent scent.<br />
<br />
The slightly smaller fox-spirit looked up at the man who wore her husband&#39;s wedding ring.  &quot;The &#39;style&#39; you just mentioned.  You mean, like, how I choose Magical Girl-style?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.  Like Alice did for her first one... then &#39;burst&#39;... no, wait... &#39;tear out&#39; for the raptor,&quot; he nodded.  Holly raised a white furred eyebrow at that.  &quot;Like the werewolf transformations in &#39;Van Helsing&#39;,&quot; he pointed out.  &quot;Then Tommy—Tom—did a Hoop TF, which... OK, so we found out Tommy&#39;s got a phobia about transform<i>ing</i>.  Being transformed, fine.  Transform<i>ing</i>?  Bad.  Then Alice &#39;inflated&#39; into a cartoon pony... then &#39;stoneskinned&#39; into a dire wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stoneskinned?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think Disney&#39;s Gargoyles at nightfall, or the hellhounds in Ghostbusters...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Interesting,&quot; Holly blinked, taking in the gorgeous views all around her as they walked.  There was a calming air about just talking, not unlike what she got from David but the fresh breeze of the wooded space was hitting her like it hadn&#39;t before.  Perhaps that was the fox part of her being more comfortable away from the city.  Whatever it was, she hadn&#39;t noticed the zen-like air on the way in... but taking their time leaving, it was beginning to sink in.<br />
<br />
All the while, Drevor&#39;s musk and desire lingered in waves from his underside.  Shaking her head, pressed forward in the conversation, using her mind to distract her instincts.  &quot;And when Tommy—Tom.  Actually, <i>why</i> is he Tom to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... well, before he set David and Trevor&#39;s transformation, he made himself five years older.&quot;  Holly stopped walking.  Drevor stopped right away and looked back at the concerned mother.  &quot;Oh, I transformed him physically back, that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t notice,&quot; he explained.  &quot;Mentally he has... body memory?  Like, he gained knowledge and life experience but can&#39;t recall the Future or anything.&quot;  He watched her reaction, his tail wagging back and forth slowly, before he actively it stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;My boy gave himself five years without his mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor blinked.  &quot;I... I wouldn&#39;t think so.  I don&#39;t know how it generated the experiences, but it seems to me Trevor had a big impact on his life.  That could be why he thought setting up a merge between the two men was a good idea.&quot;  He sighed, then shrugged, turning to face her.  &quot;Whatever the case, he set up a trigger and... well...&quot;<br />
<br />
The kitsune crossed her arms under her sizable bust, becoming a bit impatient with him meandering to the &#39;style&#39; of the transformation.  &quot;I don&#39;t get the impression you&#39;re lying, Drevor, but you do seem... reluctant... to explain your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... gory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I work in a hospital...&quot; she said, dismissing his concern as she saw it.  &quot;And besides, Tommy put you through a fence already.  Hell... <i>I</i> put you through a fence on our way here...&quot;<br />
<br />
The bulky creature put his hands out to the side.  &quot;OK, well... he did worse than that.  I... See.  David?  David died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You flatlined and came back?&quot;  He nodded.  &quot;Well, that happens,&quot; she offered, waving a hand no longer covered in flame out to the side of her thick thigh.  &quot;Explain to me what was so terrible about the &#39;style&#39; he picked for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. OK,&quot; he said, putting both hands forward towards her.  Running a hand through his shoulder-length auburn hair, he turned his hazel-green wolf eyes to meet her slitted green emerald ones.  &quot;Best I can gather... Tom asked the Chronivac to make David and Trevor both his father... and the transAI part of the application basically figured &#39;these two people are almost opposites, this will be terrible... oh, I know, let me make this an actually horrifying TF&#39; and then Tommy didn&#39;t check the work and just saved it to go off when we came into contact—&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor was tearing up, as he lead up to the big moment.  He didn&#39;t want to say it... didn&#39;t want to think it... but Holly was making him.  He hesitated, missing one step as he moved.  The Kitsune felt unease... as if she was asking a patient to explain where they&#39;d been touched or to fill out a kit.  She couldn&#39;t push him further, she realized.  This was a terrible trauma.<br />
<br />
Reaching out towards his face, she shushed him.  He felt calm as tears began streaking down his furry face.  Placing a hand to one side of his muzzle, she lowered it along his neck as she stepped around to his front.  To her vulpine ears, his hearts were thumping in his chests.  Putting a hand over his QR shirt, she closed her eyes.  Tails swaying behind her, she could gather an impression of his feelings.  Trying to recall the moment had brought up a feeling of Terror within him, and though she had no love left for Trevor, Drevor seemed enough of his own person that making him relive the trauma went against her inclination as a healer.  What fit her more was trying to quell that ingrained fear... her teal light passing through over his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what did you do?&quot; he asked, wiping a nasty yellow snot from his canine nose with the back of his right hand.  He blinked wolf eyes.  Silence went over the wood for a moment as Drevor took in a singular deep breath to all his lungs.  &quot;The moment... it... it&#39;s still there, but... far away?&quot; he asked, unsure if he was making sense.  Tears still welled up at the corners of his eyes.  &quot;Fuck, I... I&#39;ve been through that all day every time I try to recall what happened.  But now...&quot; Trailing off, the wolftaur took a big breath... a weight lifted from his spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I took it away... the pain, the terror,&quot; she explained.  &quot;I can&#39;t fix your mind, I don&#39;t think... those conflicts will still happen... but that one moment... that, I can soften.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor licked his lips, showing his extra long tongue.  &quot;Can I... can I hug you?&quot; he asked, tears still in his eyes... though they were of joy now.  He could remember what had happened to him, all the gory details, but it was like watching a movie rather than a first-hand experience.  Looking up at him, she seemed to be taking a moment to think about it.  Drevor didn&#39;t press.  &quot;Sorry... Sorry.  Rapist.  Everything is ruined,&quot; he nodded, turning to look away. &quot;Sorry.  I shouldn&#39;t have asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
She allowed herself a singular huff.  &quot;No, I... I shouldn&#39;t have pushed.  Threat of violence to get something out of you you didn&#39;t want to say... though,&quot; she considered.  &quot;It&#39;s too bad Trevor couldn&#39;t experience that.  Taste of his own medicine.&quot;  Raising a finger up, Drevor looked like he was going to say something, then relented, dropping his hand.  &quot;Don&#39;t do that,&quot; she said, placing a hand to one side of his muzzle.  &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how David&#39;s father was,&quot; he offered, making the question rhetorical.  They stood there in the shade of the forest, the quiet, and Holly simply nodded.  &quot;So do I, first hand.  Well, Trevor&#39;s all in here, so... I mean, <i>I know</i> things from him too,&quot; he said with just a hint of sadness.  &quot;Then again, I guess that doesn&#39;t work in that case...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor&#39;s dad beat him... smacked around his mom, like David&#39;s dad did to him.  So... Trevor already knew how it felt and decided to keep it going anyway.&quot;  Holly didn&#39;t know that.  Trevor never said anything like this before.  &quot;In fact... I guess Trevor&#39;s life is overflowing with making the wrong call when something really mattered...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I can believe,&quot; she confided, then sighed.  &quot;Drevor...&quot; he turned his canine head to face her.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry I thought you were Trevor.  I can see you&#39;re not, now.  I&#39;m sorry I hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The muscular creature smirked, then waved a hand to the side.  &quot;Honestly, apparently my body didn&#39;t mind,&quot; he offered, motioning with his right hand towards his rear were his red mega-boner still resided.  &quot;Fuck, you hurt... So I&#39;m glad you did it to the one person on the planet who could take it and not someone else,&quot; he chuckled.  She pulled one part of her v-neck tighter around her breasts.  &quot;I mean... the guy you <i>thought</i> I was.  I think he&#39;d have gotten the message.  Fuck that guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  &quot;I did... more times that I would have liked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah!  Ah, fair,&quot; he let some of the tension run out of him.  &quot;David would totally let you peg him,&quot; Drevor just tossed out nonchalantly, somehow, after all that had happened.  Holly&#39;s eyes darted towards Drevor muscular form, then away.  If foxes could blush, she would.  It had been something she wanted to try in the bedroom for ages, but she was stuck with a man who thought taking a dildo up the ass was gay.  &quot;So, I mean, you have that to look forward to... with him.&quot;  As she turned away from him, the wolftaur gave her backside a long look.  He admired the muscles, not as bulky as his own.  The white fur, the glorious teal Celtic runes around the White family crest.  Looking back after a moment, his eyes met hers.  She was crying.  &quot;Uh.  Um.  I&#39;m sorry?&quot; he asked.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t know what memory I dredged up... you look really—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to kill you!&quot; she blurted out.  Tilting her head down, she put her hands just below her tall triangular ears.  &quot;Damn me... damn him,&quot; she pointed vaguely in my direction.  &quot;You&#39;re a real person, Drevor.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged.  &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I was just walking you to your death...&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolftaur shrugged again... then tentatively put his hands on her shoulder.  &quot;Yeah, and?  I accepted that hours ago as possible, Holly.  I&#39;ve been dreading it all day.&quot;  His hands slid down to her upper arms, dragging paw pads over her fluffy white fur.  &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t <i>want</i> to die... but I&#39;ve been down this road before when I was too small to understand... as David.  That feeling that all you are is a burden to other people... mentally, financially, whateverly... all culminating in some really dark thoughts.&quot;  He shrugged.  &quot;But how would this even work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly leaned in against Drevor&#39;s strong pecs, a free hand running up over his manly chest as she casually burned away just the blood that&#39;d made his white shirt crusty and brown.  &quot;We&#39;re both canines,&quot; she smirked.  &quot;And I&#39;m gunna get physically younger over time.&quot;  She laughed lightly, leaning her head into his chest and up under his chin.  Those muscular arms pushed behind her back, embracing his mate in a hug.  She pushed lightly against his chest,  &quot;I don&#39;t think we can do this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a little confused,&quot; he whispered.  &quot;And I may be thinking a little clouded right now... what thing do you think we can&#39;t do?&quot; he wondered.  &quot;I meant balancing Trevor and David&#39;s lives with you, and you meant physically.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;Physically is easy, I think.  We&#39;ve gone from bone-breaking to semi-teasing inside of an hour.&quot;  Grinning, he diverted back to her last thought: &quot;I&#39;ve got seventy years experience, but you&#39;re going to live beyond me.  There&#39;s already two great kids in the picture, one of which definitely wants to be a wolftaur... If you still wanted it, I bet we could be even better parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly raised an eyebrow at that.  &quot;I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m ready to try restarting a family,&quot; she smirked.  &quot;I mean, whose house do we go to for Christmas?&quot;<br />
<br />
He rubbed her back, then let his hands fall away from her so she could step back.  &quot;I could be a better parent than either of the two dudes whose memories make me up,&quot; he offered with a shrug.  &quot;David could have made a decent stay-at-home dad, I think.  Personally, I think I can do <i>better</i> than <i>him</i>.&quot;  He held her hands in his as she looked into his eyes.  &quot;What&#39;s to stop us from trying to make this work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you say us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean all of us.  You, me, the kids... new kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor and David?&quot; the big wolftaur interjected.  He sighed.  &quot;Sadly, right now, they&#39;re dead,&quot; he said simply, making his perspective clear.  &quot;I have thoughts about making each of their lives work for us... but it&#39;s just me.  I&#39;m Drevor, at least until we maybe come up with a better name.&quot;  His head tilted to the side.  &quot;I&#39;m open to suggestions... I just ran through a lot of mental permutations until I got something that sounded like a name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a strong opinion about restarting the family,&quot; she stated, sure.  Drevor nodded, a smile on his canine muzzle.  &quot;Really?  But, again, my work.  It&#39;ll have to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maternity leave can ruin careers.  You know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Drevor smirked.  &quot;I see the confusion.  You think I&#39;m asking you to carry another child...&quot;  She blinked at him.  &quot;I know your shape-changing can do gender stuff... the allusions to pegging...&quot; he said, making swirling hand motion in the air.  &quot;Holly Phillips... I&#39;m saying we can use <i>my</i> womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably just the heat talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolftaur blinked, dumbfounded.  A moment later, he lifted his meaty paws upwards, putting all the pieces together.  He sniffed the air, taking in the now familiar smell.  &quot;<i>I&#39;m</i> in heat?&quot; he wondered aloud.  &quot;I knew that wasn&#39;t <i>your</i> scent, but... figured it must be a wolf around here somewhere and that&#39;s why my rocket wouldn&#39;t go down.&quot;  He put a finger to the side of his jaw.  &quot;Then again, being August means they&#39;d be way out of season...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a few hours old, and you want to be pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... yes?  Yes.  David&#39;s been wanting to get pregnant for over twenty years, and can you just envision Trevor with a baby bump?&quot;  Holly laughed, but it was a jovial fox cackle.  &quot;Yeah, see, that?  It&#39;s been seventy years—sort of—and I&#39;ve never been pregnant once.  Meanwhile, you...&quot; Drevor trailed off.  &quot;I... Hey, I only have the memories of two people,&quot; he said a bit softly.  &quot;I hope this isn&#39;t presuming too much, but... based on earlier—&quot;  He wiggled his hands to the sides of his head, using a physical action to clear his thoughts.  &quot;I&#39;ve never had the impression you... you know... didn&#39;t <i>want</i> Tommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kitsune put her hands together, then put her left one around Drevor&#39;s back.  She leaned in and spoke softly in a caring tone.  &quot;He was a surprise, sure.  Unplanned.  But, no.  I&#39;ve always loved my boy.&quot;  The big wolfaur leaned into the fox, nuzzling his muzzle into her snout.  &quot;I can&#39;t imagine not loving him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me either,&quot; the wolf confessed, taking a breath.  &quot;Neither sets of parents were great in my case.  David&#39;s were worse than Trevor&#39;s, actually.  Trevor&#39;s mom loved him deeply and—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go back to talking about us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right.  Sorry.  I dwell a lot it seems.&quot;  Drevor allowed himself a big canine grin when he thought about what she&#39;d just said.  &quot;There&#39;s an <i>&#39;us&#39;</i> now?&quot;  Holly just rolled her eyes as if to say &#39;yes, obviously&#39;.  &quot;What a rollercoaster of a day,&quot; he chuckled, hugging her into his side, squeezing her for just a moment before releasing.  &quot;There&#39;s only two things that&#39;d make this better, and both are <i>easily accessible!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, if you say one of those things is sex...&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor laughed, and smiled a big white smile.  &quot;I-I was going to say &#39;and the second thing is the pizza you brought&#39;, and then you were supposed to say &#39;well, what&#39;s the fi—&quot;  There was a wind current and the feeling of cloth strips at his side.  When he looked down at her, her fluffy white breasts were on full display.  Teal areolae present with perky nipples atop them.  There was no kimono any longer, just Holly&#39;s gloriously tattooed birthday suit.  &quot;G&#39;damn, you are fine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You like this body, or... maybe something more <i>fitting?</i>  Your pick.&quot;  Drevor glanced at me like I was going to end the passage with that, but no.  It&#39;s been a long road to get here, so I figure this would be more fair seeing as there&#39;d been no sex in the branch so far.  Holly followed her man&#39;s eyes and looked toward me without seeing me, and I just let the moment ride.  Her look was inquisitive.  &quot;They doing something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like <i>I</i> get to choose your change,&quot; he smirked, looking away from us and back to the woman in front of him.  A bit more of David&#39;s tone came forth as he spoke.  Playfully, he acted almost as if he were ordering at a drive-through: &quot;I pick... fox, because you clearly just <i>are</i>; then tauric, because <i>mounting;</i> and then herm, because I want to be bred,&quot; he considered, tapping a finger to his chin as if deciding if he should Super-Size:  &quot;Oh... can you do a little hyper?&quot;<br />
<br />
She titled her head, looking up into those hazel-green wolf eyes.  &quot;If you explain it to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know those pictures where the person&#39;s genitals or breasts are disproportionately larger than their body?&quot;  She nodded.  &quot;That, but... I think your breasts are fine as is.  I just wanna be filled, you know?&quot;  He smirked, then looked down at his QR shirt.  Shrugging first, he began to pull the tight cloth up over his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Here&#39; asks the woman about to grow a dick who&#39;s already naked in the middle of the woods.  Yes, here,&quot; he looked around, then put his arms wide.  &quot;Weird animals in a forest with just the barest hint of possible hikers walking up on us,&quot; he grinned wide.<br />
<br />
Placing her hands on her wide hips, she gave a half-hearted frown. &quot;And what <i>if</i> someone does walk up on us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor shrugged. &quot;Exhibitionist,&quot; he said, thumbing at himself.  &quot;Though, if it&#39;s hunters, I don&#39;t think they can hurt us.  If its hikers, they might just take pictures.&quot;  He took a few tentative steps around her shorter form.  &quot;Whoever it is, we could always ask them if they want to join... can you turn people into animals?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kitsune have been known to curse people to the form of an animal or monster,&quot; she considered, &quot;but I haven&#39;t done it.&quot;  Reaching out, she ran a hand through his thick winter coat as he moved passed.  &quot;Yet,&quot; she offered.  He stopped in front of her, looking down at her from his half a foot height difference.  &quot;How do you feel about... big women?&quot;<br />
<br />
The mass of muscle which was the imposing form of the dire wolftaur grinned at her.  &quot;Just remember... whatever we do now, we&#39;ll feel like we have to top later,&quot; he said with a smirk.  &quot;But I&#39;m certainly into it.&quot;  With that, he stepped up to her and placed his strong hands on her hourglass waist.  &quot;I wish to feel your change...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Top, huh?&quot; she leaned into his body, a hand roaming across the scars interrupting the fur on his firm abs.  Her other hand hugged his head close to her chest as she increased in size, first in height, then in weight and muscle.  Fur as silky as ever pushed upwards along his upper torso as her body increased in mass.  It was as if she were being pulled alongside his lupine muzzle, but she simply grew against him, only moving her feet further apart as necessary.  Eventually, she ceased when he could only barely peek up at her from between her breasts as she now stood somewhere just beyond eight foot tall.  As he nuzzled into her cleavage, she proceeded to grow taller still.  Her breasts pushing against the backsides of his head, covering more of her lean upper abs than they had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s this for a top?&quot; she hissed through closed teeth.  The earth of the forest floor rolled outwards from them as Holly Phillips moved her one hand from his abs to his underside, easily gripping his lower torso as if it were just the lengthy tail of a biped.  Grass and moss layered out from the smoothening stone beneath them as she leaned forward over him at an angle.  Further increasing in height, her lean muscles pushed the fox-spirit&#39;s lean body to thiccness as she lifted the wolftaur&#39;s tail up under him, pulling it lightly with her energy as she forced him backwards onto his long spine.  The mossy earth billowed out from under Drevor as his lover began to tower over him, her size matching the length of his tauric form as he laid there in mating press.<br />
<br />
All the while, the wolftaur hadn&#39;t been neglecting his much larger mate.  From his place between her two love pillows, his long tongue reached out and circled her left nipple.  One finger of his left hand reached down to her mound and teased, testing the texture of her new vulva to locate her new clit.  She cooed once his thumb-pad grazed over the top of it.  He couldn&#39;t retract his claws, so he carefully moves his hand to an altered position.  Sinking a finger in between her pedals, he pushed in another between those lips one at a time as she grew larger while she repositioned him.  In the end he was rubbing her large nub between his index finger and thumb with the rest of his hand inside her entrance.  She moaned, and her whole body shook against him as she laid him down, her snatch aligning perfectly with his raging boner.<br />
<br />
He whispered softly to her as his pointed red tip glazed her already moist entrance his pre.  His small, foot and a quarter long shaft encircled her mound, coating her crotch-fur.  &quot;You&#39;re sure you&#39;re not in heat?&quot;  It was a human sentiment, but given how things had actually gone for her in the past, a welcome change.  He might as well have been politely reminding her he didn&#39;t have a condom, because that was true.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d smell it,&quot; she insisted.  &quot;I want your pussy&#39;s full attention, so let&#39;s get this thing softened...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that insistence, Drevor pushed his cock slowly up into her waiting cunt.  She moaned, though it was clear that her size was more than a match for his own.  Looking down, her breasts to either side of his upper torso, they both realized at once that his knot wouldn&#39;t lock to her.  Leaning forward, she whispered lustily into one of his triangular ears: &quot;I think I&#39;m too big,&quot; she giggled, reaching a hand up underneath him to push him against her opening.  His knot passed her lips easily, then slipped back out.<br />
<br />
Drevor leaned forward and whispered, the woods moving with Holly&#39;s magical power.  Fox-fire took the brush and grew it into a sort of overgrown wall of green.  The trees overhead leaned towards them, their canopy blocking out the midday sun and giving them just a mild darkness.  Though their built-in low-light vision would keep everything visible to them, she&#39;d casually given them a bit more privacy by moving the overgrowth.  A lump of soft stone pushed up behind her wolftaur mate, softened by moss, and propping up his back more as he spoke to her quietly.<br />
<br />
Grinning he made a groan of disagreement as he licked her nipple which was now about the size of his fist.  &quot;I think I&#39;m <i>too small</i>.&quot;  Taking the hint, teal energy reached down towards his crotch as the big thumb of the hand that she&#39;d been pulling her towards him with touched his rod at the next slow thrust.  As Drevor&#39;s muzzle wrapped around her nipple, his tongue sliding into the duct, she pushed some of her magics into his lupine shaft.  After a few, slow, rhythmic thrusts, his bulb would no longer pass her outer lips.<br />
<br />
Drevor had no idea how big he was, though he suspected his penis would reach almost to his front legs now if not sheathed by this giant fox woman.  His sword in her soft flesh, the two of them thrust again and again, but the knot was now denied.  <i>Too large?</i> Drevor wondered briefly.  <i>No,</i> he realized.  <i>A challenge!</i><br />
<br />
As the anthropomorphic vixen leaned down over her dire wolf mate, she arched her back as his tongue invaded her breast.  His shaft was just the right size now, but his knot was too big.  One hand of hers pulled him up against her as she knelt, the other hand on the ground behind her to keep from bending too far back.  The wolftaur took the initiative, his hind legs wrapping up under her three tails from below as his own tail wagged out behind them both.  A moment later, his front legs wrapped their hand-paws around her waist just under her breasts.  Using all four to pull against her, he thrust harder and harder, attempting to build up rhythm which each impact.  As she leaned into him, his front climbed up beyond her breasts and his muzzle came closer to her own.  Allowing himself a growl of lust, he leaned forward and licked the inside of her muzzle with that long tongue.  She replied in kind until he pulled back briefly to speak...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve.  Got.  This,&quot; he insisted, his now melon-sized balls slapping up against her plump ass with each thrust.  &quot;On.  Three.  Push,&quot; he spoke in rhythm, their bodies having synced with each other despite the size and shape difference.  &quot;One,&quot; he said, his hazel-green lupine eyes meeting her emerald green vulpine ones. &quot;Two.&quot;  He grinned.  Lifting that giant oak tree was way harder than what he was about to do.  &quot;Three!&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly&#39;s hand at his back jerk him up towards her as his four legs wrenched her rear towards him.  There was a tension in the air, a static energy as if all the world had slowed in this moment.  The two of them together yanked their spirits close.  Teal energy rippling across his crotch as if lifting it with a third hand.  His own strength making her cry for just a moment as he pulled up into her.  The two solid red spheres of his bulbous knot passed her outer labia and into her wet white snatch.<br />
<br />
Growling a great victory, the wolftaur&#39;s ears shifted up to take in every nuance of his mate&#39;s lurid moan.  Just as quickly as it had locked, Drevor pulled back, tugging against her erogenous zone.  Unable to get free, Drevor grinned a wicked grin.  <i>Perfect</i> he thought, but his growl of claim was clear to the fox&#39;s ears.  Now it was a real tie and he picked up the pace.<br />
<br />
Not to be left out, Holly let go of his back and placed both her hands on the hard earth to either side of his shoulders as she leaned down into him.  The mating press&#39;s impacts slammed against her, within her, she too pushed herself down upon him.  The moment of lock was only the beginning, and she felt Drevor&#39;s balls tightening in preparation.<br />
<br />
Months of no sex culminated in pent up desire.  Mixed emotions bled away from the moment.  No fucking Trevor.  No cheating with David.  This was him now, one man, one mate, and though he was inside her now, she wished to show him just the same in a few moments.  Distracted, and still thrusting all the while, Holly missed the body language cue where the bowling ball-sized testicles she&#39;d given her man unleashed their torrent within her.<br />
<br />
Shock filled her as did his cream.  The wolf&#39;s body shook with continued spasms, trying to keep up his thrusting... an urge that wasn&#39;t quite wolf or human or anything else that made him up but some combination of everything which lead to him opening up his muzzle and releasing a pleasure-filled howl.<br />
<br />
When Holly lifted up her vulpine lips to mirror his howl, she had no idea would sound like screaming.  She laughed harshly, and the laughter broke her trusting stride.  Her vocal cords shifted more lupine and a bit more human, and on the next impact from within, her body responded... both by cumming the hardest she&#39;d ever felt, and by mixing her own howl with his.<br />
<br />
Somewhere not far away, a different wolf pack joined the song.<br />
<br />
The release from within coated her walls.  The vocal release of the two seemed to ignite teal flames around them.  Suddenly there were shadows which danced in the dusk-like shade all around them as if they&#39;d been amongst romantically lit candles this whole time.  Their howls continued until their sizable lungs were emptied, and the female form of the kitsune collapsed over her wolftaur mate&#39;s body.  They were tied, now, physically and metaphysically.  As they lowered their muzzles, they looked into each other&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
They spoke without speaking... a non-verbal agreement as they cooed and moaned with the tie that told the other many things.  They&#39;d each never experienced as such before... and the warmth of their bodies made them feel as one.  In a way, they were.  There was an energy there, spent, released, as the giantess vulpine hugged her long but smaller wolfen mate.  The cuddled, and grew silent, each one waiting for the other to break the silence.<br />
<br />
(|[***]|)<br />
<br />
Moments passed and the two remained tied.  Neither of them had said anything, just given each other knowing looks.  But, at the point in which Drevor began to massage Holly&#39;s sizable breasts as she laid over top of him, she finally found words for him...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to go again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I am,&quot; he said.  &quot;Any... any other thoughts before we go again?&quot; he wondered, flexing the muscles of his underside to push again within Holly&#39;s inner walls.  &quot;When I locked—&quot; she gave him a look, raising an eyebrow.  &quot;When <i>we</i> locked...&quot; she nodded at him.  &quot;I think I felt something in your sides move.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaning back away from him, their crotches still together, the big-breasted beast nodded.  &quot;You may have bruised some ribs,&quot; she concurred.  &quot;They still hurt a little... but in a good way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kitsune don&#39;t have regeneration,&quot; he pointed out.<br />
<br />
Holly Phillips blinked, thinking back to the opening fight which was somehow still this same passage.  &quot;You mean to say... I absolutely <i>bodied</i> you earlier and all that time... if you&#39;d maybe gotten one good shot in—&quot;<br />
<br />
The dire wolftaur smirked, comfortably crushed beneath his mate&#39;s powerful legs.  He shrugged against the moss-covered earth she&#39;d made into a bed for the two of them.  &quot;I could have hurt you?  Yeah.  Probably,&quot; he granted, his lower legs squeezing above and below those thicc thighs.  &quot;Like when your feet were dangling near me on the log?  Sure.&quot;  The wolfaur leaned up from where he was on his back.  Sitting forward, he smiled.  &quot;We&#39;re both deadly, in our own ways.  Neither of us permanently hurt the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tilting her head to the side, the giantess looked down at the smaller, dual-sexed creature.  &quot;You weren&#39;t fighting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until you pulled out the fox-fire, I could take all your damage... p-probably,&quot; he smirked, though he honestly wasn&#39;t certain about that.  His tone revealed that clearly to her ears.  &quot;If I hit you, I don&#39;t think I ever would have convinced you I wasn&#39;t Trevor.&quot;  Shrugging again, he sighed.  &quot;Call it... David&#39;s intuition.  He&#39;s not great at lots, but he can dance through a social moment... and talking you down?  That was social.  No amount of violence was going to improve the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly ran a hand down her chin.  &quot;David was great at lots of things... just things that weren&#39;t useful to steady employment.&quot;  She wiggled her hips.  Inside her, he was still solid.  &quot;Does this thing ever get smaller?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Drevor chuckled, then shook his head.  &quot;Wolves have a baculum.&quot;  Her eyes indicated she didn&#39;t know that word.  &quot;Most mammals have a bone in the penis.  Human&#39;s don&#39;t.&quot;  His hands were back behind him now, helping him prop up from underneath her.  &quot;Also, you made me bigger, so I&#39;ve no idea what my base size should be now,&quot; he offered as a thought.  &quot;I don&#39;t feel my knot straining anymore, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
The big vixen looked down, then slowly pulled one leg forward, half-kneeling overtop him.  Pushing down to stand up, Drevor&#39;s red rocket slowly slid out of her entrance, looking like it was now almost two foot long soft.  &#39;Soft&#39; should be in quotes.  Apparently his girth had been increased, and his balls now crowded the insides of his rear legs.<br />
<br />
A white waterfall of jizz poured out of her.<br />
<br />
Drevor&#39;s bulb had been performing the job of a cork, and now that it was gone, all three sets of legs were covered in a cartoonish amount of cum.  He hadn&#39;t noticed at the time, but it seemed like maybe her abs were a bit better defined now after removal, as if her belly had been plump with the results of their effort and was now expelling it over him in a gush of salty white.<br />
<br />
Grinning, Drevor moved his legs underneath him, turning to face Holly Phillips who now stood about fifteen foot tall.  Looking far up at her from his 6&#39;8&quot; stature, he leaned into her sticky legs, her pussy right there for him at mouth level.  Leaning his muzzle in toward her white furred muff he licked tentatively at first.  But soon after, he was cleaning his own semen from her outer lips with his tongue as any wolf might clean his mate.<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, Holly reached down at put a hand on his head as he worked to clean her privates.  A mischievous smile slowly bled its way across her face as she stood tall over her mate.  As Drevor licked around her inner thighs, her human-like outer lips shifted shape, becoming more tri-lipped like a feral canine&#39;s might be... like her mate&#39;s was.  Pushing out from just above those lips, her clitoris slowly divided in two, splitting vertically.  One moved a little further up her crotch and began to change in shape.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Drevor gave long licks from just behind her left knee and slowly up towards her crotch then back again, all while keeping his hazel-green eyes on his lover&#39;s genitals.  As he sensually ran his tongue over her legs, up and down, deliberately teasing, that second clit began to grow.  From the top of her labia, a furred scrotum began to fall ahead of her existing female sex.<br />
<br />
It was then that Drevor&#39;s wolfen eyes looked far up at his vulpine mate&#39;s.  Clearly she was making herself male enough to take him, but the unsurety of doing so with a man beneath her was clear on her face.  Trevor&#39;s impression of the moment would have been sickening.  He was not hateful to gay people, but far too heterosexual to be anything but repulsed by the proceedings.  Unmanly.  Luckily, that voice was quelled in large part because of David&#39;s pansexual nature, but <i>also</i> Trevor&#39;s adjacency to homosexuality while serving abroad, trying to sleep through thumping of his bunkmates.  All this and David&#39;s few experiences with giving head all came to the front as he leaned his black nose up underneath Holly&#39;s tiny testicles and inhaled her new musk.  Playful eyes met her&#39;s from far below as he slowly extended his long lupine tongue up and out, circling her balls and her micropenis twice before slowly retracting his pink muscle back into his muzzle even more slowly, teasingly.<br />
<br />
The kitsune took the hint, and teal energies sparked as her wolftaur lover licked her shaft and nuzzled against her balls.  It was as if he was coaxing her out of a sheath she didn&#39;t have.  Each lick was another few centimeters of teal-colored flesh as the hardening and growing shaft pulled up her silky white fur into that once missing furred cover.<br />
<br />
Pushing her stones up so that they fell within their sack to either side of his muzzle, he gave a lick across her still-present feminine lips.  As he did so, he shuttered and moaned, remembering that lovely pungent scent in the air was indeed the heat of a female wolf, but that it wasn&#39;t her.  Having stood up on four legs, his eyes slid toward his back to find his own tail was already raised and raised high.  It was time.  His cookie was moist and needed to be parted...<br />
<br />
Looking up at Holly, he squeezed her legs with his hands behind her knees.  Those white-furred hands of hers were placed lovingly to either side of his head as he raised his face towards her.  His tongue had encircled her long teal shaft like a snake, ending with it wrapped around over her frenulum, and as he lifted his noggin, he pulled his tongue back into his mouth in an agonizingly slow effort to get her slick and ready.  As the pink muscle retracted, his eyes kept locked with hers as a challenge of desire... a desire which manifested as the low whine of a needy bitch.<br />
<br />
Holly stood as a giant above Drevor at fifteen foot tall.  Her hands only just barely reaching around his head from where it was at her dual-sexed crotch.  She gave him a committal set of vulpine yips as she encouraged him to lean back away from her.  Keeping his eyes up in her direction, the dire wolftaur took steps to face away from her giantess form.  That raised tail showed her her mate&#39;s need.  His legs bracing for an expected impact.<br />
<br />
Leaning back, she put her hands up and into the trees as she bent their branches closer to her hands with teal energies.  Holding onto them, her body shifted yet again.  Her legs shortened, and her torso lengthened as she became a very long foxoid.  Those three tails behind her shrinking as her rump lowered on her long body.  A moment later, her torso began to bend into a L-shape, with the beginnings of new paws jutting out from the bend and towards Drevor.  Narrowing all over, her upper torso became far more human-sized.  Rather quickly, the kitsune&#39;s form beneath her waist was a leaner, vulpine-shaped creature.  Now she mirrored her mate, a humanoid upper body that connected where the neck would be on a large fox... a kitsune-taur.<br />
<br />
While her tails were not as long as Drevor&#39;s, Holly&#39;s three tails fanned out even wider than her mate&#39;s singular fluffy one.  The teal tips of those tails were like paintbrushes which created swaths of fox-fire energy in balls just above and behind her.  Loosening her grip in the trees, she balanced briefly on the balls of her hind toes as those three tails swayed and kept her vertically still near to fifteen foot long.<br />
<br />
The forest reached out towards her as she pulled her arms inward, her body falling forward fast.  In a moment, she impacted across her mate&#39;s tauric lower body, her breasts shoving him from the back.  She yipped a surprise, not meaning to impact him so hard.  Those teal-clawed hands of hers reached around to his front, lingering on the scars across his firm abs before she wove her fingers together at his front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.  Little heavier than I thought,&quot; she admitted, her first human words in a while.  Leaning back his head, Drevor licked his tongue longways across her muzzle.  She was mounting him.  It wasn&#39;t dominance, but preparation.  He took all her weight and repositioned, stepping his rear legs just a little wider while she lowered herself along his back.<br />
<br />
Whispering towards her, his words dripped with need: &quot;Let&#39;s knot first this time,&quot; he said.  &quot;I know you&#39;re already hard, but that rod needs to be <i>in</i> me, not <i>over</i> me.&quot;  He smirked, then gave another teasing lick to the inside of her open snout.<br />
<br />
Holly nodded, nuzzling her mostly white muzzle up into Drevor&#39;s aurburn-colored mullet.  Repositioning her rear legs so that they stood with their toes next to his own, she leaned back.  She made a few tentative thrusts.  The kitsune could feel his cookie right where she expected it.  However, each attempt had her missing the mark even with her pointed shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;This... this is a bit weird just trying to aim my crotch alone,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;I might be too big again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor chuckled.  &quot;Move your front paws to grip my waist like I did for you when we were reversed,&quot; he offered her advice.  &quot;If you need to make me bigger again or anything else, please do.  I know you&#39;re not used to having a big cock and while half of me has always dreamed of this, I don&#39;t want my dream to make it weird for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or anything else...&quot; she repeated softly.  Shifting over his form, she gave her fox lower body a bit more mass... like if perhaps a &#39;dire fox&#39; were a thing.  Moving backwards from his upper back just a few inches, she repositioned her front legs so that they could reach and wrap to his waist.  With those new and stronger legs, she pulled him towards her throbbing shaft and missed again.<br />
<br />
Grumbling to herself, she leaned back further with her lower body.  Getting her tip just along the outside of his moist cookie, she pushed energies into his lower torso changing things about him and altering unknowingly altering his Preset as a result.  That three-lipped vulva plumped further, his clit becoming more of a notable red tip.  Slowly, as he had done, she fed her lengthy shaft inward passed his lips.  Finding resistance, she increased the inside of his passage so that it could take her rod.  But as she pushed inwards, her mind wandered into a lusty minefield of ideas...<br />
<br />
Realizing that her length was shorter than his, she increased the length of her cock, keeping its tip forward.  <i>He&#39;s just under two foot, yeah?</i> She considered, then grinned.  Pushing her size inside him to two foot, she realized he was trying to grip her with internal muscles, to pull against her inside.  With a whim, she increased the total number of ribbed edges to his passage, allowing him the ability gift her with what amounted to blowjob from within his vagina.<br />
<br />
She growled with lust as she began thrusting, her knot already tied with him.  A few alterations and his inner opening became designed like a lock for her key, holding her knot in place.  As she tugged lightly against their tie, Drevor moaned loudly, leaning back into her breasts as she was once against pushed against her back.  Her mind had not logged the movement, but she was now both fully within him, and also properly pushed atop him so that her front was at his back again.<br />
<br />
As she moved their insides with magic, Drevor&#39;s hot breath impacted her muzzle and she leaned in, hugging him from behind as she licked his black lips.  Inside him, her girth grew and began to get tight, so she increased his passages elasticity so that it could match her size.  Lastly, as she began to thrust harder and harder, she could feel the wall of his cervix...<br />
<br />
Without so much as a thought or asking, she made certain he was ovulating... as that&#39;s what he wanted.  <i>But he had a pregnancy fetish, yeah?  Why not double up?  Or double-double?</i>  He moaned and nearly howled as his insides altered and he could feel it.  Her fox-fire coating down his sides as she divided his womb once then twice more, making it possible that he could carry multiple concurrent pregnancies... each next womb becoming accessible with his next heat.<br />
<br />
Holly Phillips didn&#39;t know if she could do this with anyone else, but their bond and trust was of a mated pair.  Unbeknownst to her, she had imbued with him just a taste of magic and his body responded.  Perhaps there was something more mystical in that very small percentage of werewolf, but whatever the case, Drevor&#39;s body was responding to more than just her thrusting.<br />
<br />
In fact, it was almost like the sex was secondary at first.  The heightened feelings from inside of Drevor as Holly filled him were more pleasurable still.  His body felt joy as it pulled against her length.  From behind her bulbous knot, longways up toward her pointed tip, as if he were giving her an internal handjob... which, in a way, he was.<br />
<br />
This all happened while the two still rocked against each other... a thrust backwards with his hind legs was mirrored with a &#39;thrust&#39; forward with his internal muscles.  He pushed against her crotch as if he could force more of her inside him, then pulled along her hard teal rod within himself.  Over and over, one rhythmic push after the next.  It was as if his legs, towards his lips, and up inside of him was trying to <i>pull</i> all of Holly inside.  And just when she thought that maybe she&#39;d given him too much strength, she felt her testicles tense up and shiver.<br />
<br />
Her upper body leaned hard into his back as one of his hands reached back and hugged her from the front.  As her balls kept slapping his underside, that shiver she felt burst like a dam.  She yipped from surprised, never having had a penis before.  Soon enough she was coating every part of his insides as he shook but didn&#39;t cum...<br />
<br />
Growling a challenge, Drevor&#39;s internal paced picked up as his legs kept time with her thrusts still.  It was a new and wonderful challenge, but he was using those new internal muscles to yank hard against her solid shaft.  Tugging down her length towards his front, he milked her for all she was worth.  His supernatural regeneration giving him the stamina to go on for so long that Holly ended up laying her muzzle on his shouldered with her eyes going back into her head.  She could feel him pulling her and pulling her and she feared that if she fell asleep, maybe she&#39;d be pulled inside all the way!  Moaning, she called out towards him something his mind did not grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he thrust again and again back against her, perhaps harder than he intended.  He truly couldn&#39;t make out what she had said, unaware that she had created a sex monster with his internal changes.  He simply felt energized and empowered, and he was using his new abilities to give his mate exactly what she&#39;d wanted—<br />
<br />
&quot;Drevor!&quot; she whimpered.  It caught his attention because it was like a tone of fear... if not fear, pain!  &quot;I&#39;m raw!&quot; she yelped as he pulled in against her again.  &quot;Rawr...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shocked into the moment, Drevor lost his place in his dual-timing of thrusts and pulls.  His body, however, knew there was only one real way for this to finish and would not allow him to just stop.  It was as if a car pileup had happened within his body.  Muscles slamming into each other staggering as their rhythm was lost.  All that missed energy turned into a body-rocking shudder as Drevor&#39;s insides quaked and shook.<br />
<br />
A long, low moan escaped through his lupine lips as he came and came... his insides still milking Holly all the while.  She groaned, but realized he was finally, <i>mercifully</i> ending.  Her body collapsed on his as the tension ran out, no longer having to keep her outsides from going into his insides.  Instead of another howl, the two moaned in unison as their bodies each became slowed, their thrusts and pulls weakening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... deserved... that,&quot; Holly chuckled, her upper body collapsed against her mate as her body still stood hugged his lower torso.  &quot;I think I... over-magicked you,&quot; she chuckled.  He found a moment to lick her face as his insides still slowly pulled at her length within him, her balls long since fully empty.  &quot;Maybe I should reverse it...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor chuckled along with her.  &quot;I think... I think we just need practice,&quot; he offered to her.  &quot;Your first day... with a dick... and my first day with.  Wow.  Whatever those internal muscles are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren&#39;t normally like that,&quot; she insisted.  &quot;I... I overclocked your whole system.&quot;  Allowing herself a laugh, she groaned as she felt pain coming to her body.  &quot;Uh... I think you pulled a muscle.  Groin muscle?  It started to invert,&quot; she said and it was funny, so she laughed again, and then groaned in pain once more.  &quot;Yup.  Totally deserved that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dire wolftaur leaned back into his mate.  Turning his head, their eyes met once again... hazel-green lupine to emerald green vulpine.  Smiling, he stuck his tongue out at her in a &#39;blep&#39;.  &quot;Giving new muscles to a creature as strong as I... Yeah.  I think maybe you did get what you deserve.&quot;  He licked her lips.  &quot;I really hope... I lived up to expectations...&quot;<br />
<br />
She was panting, standing over top of him.  Eventually, she lifted one front leg up over his back and to his side.  Moving her rear leg from that side and up over his tail, she stood butt-to-butt with him briefly.  That is, until he stepped sideways, putting his body alongside hers instead.<br />
<br />
Leaning towards her, he rolled onto his side with his butt tugged into the air towards he crotch.  Motioning beside him, he encouraged her to lay tummy-to-tummy with him.  Though her dick was still lodged inside of him, they made it work.  He pulled her upper body close to his as she laid down facing him, her knot working as a pivot point.<br />
<br />
Leaning in towards each other, the two shared muzzle licks as they hugged each other with all six sets of limbs.  This had been more than either of them had hopped for.  As they embraced, they listened to their hearts slow an found it calming.  No words.  It a full-body cuddle by two tauric beings, mentally preparing themselves for the eventual family gathering...<br />
<br />
(|[***]|)<br />
<br />
Drevor chuckled.  After all those &quot;Dragon Ball Z Abridged references, I thought for sure you&#39;d&#39;ve been done,&quot; he remarked as the pair exited the tree-line where Alice had decorated the area with flowers the night before.  Taking a breath, the dire wolftaur stood in his cleaned white QR shirt and brand new teal, white, and black plaid carapace which covered his lower body down to his ankles.  Glancing over his shoulder, he smirked at Holly.  She was enjoying her man&#39;s new saddle.  &quot;But, &#39;cloths beam&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Cloths beam&#39;,&quot; nodded the kistune who was back in her fully anthropomorphic vixen form and sitting sidesaddle upon Drevor&#39;s lower back.  She was just as busty as she&#39;d been when she arrived at the ranch, but lacked all the male additions she&#39;d given herself to breed her mate.  It was her determination the children might find <i>that</i> weird, of all things.  &quot;Time to find out if fox-fire can properly reheat pizza,&quot; she giggled.  Back in her kimono-dress, the vulpine figure hugged her husband from the back as he approached the busted perimeter fence of the farmland.  Holly repaired the wood with her nature magic and Drevor slotted the beams back into place like he&#39;d done earlier in the day.  &quot;Uh... when do David&#39;s grandparents get back?&quot; she wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;End of next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so what&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I already called time-off for Trevor earlier.  Bit of short notice, but the growl in my voice made them think I&#39;d really come down with the flu,&quot; he said.  &quot;As for what comes next... David had a lot of ideas, so now I do too.  But before that happens, I just... want to spend time with my family... And, in a little more than week, I&#39;ll do some renovations <i>our</i> house... and maybe our neighbors.&quot;  He smirked.<br />
<br />
The fox woman nodded as they circled around to the front of the house and Holly&#39;s station wagon.  &quot;Yeah... I&#39;m not a fan of changing people&#39;s minds per say... but I&#39;m way <i>less</i> of a fan of going back to human after all this,&quot; she said, motioning to the two of them.  &quot;Life hasn&#39;t been great recently.  The pandemic is basically over, sure... but Tom.  Tom?  Tom.  Tom is starting middle school... and I&#39;ve gotta finishes my doctorate.&quot;  She leaned into his back.  &quot;What about you?  Pregnant soon, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced at her.  &quot;I dunno.  Might notta been enough spooge.  Probably want to repeat that a few more times before my heat ends just to be sure.&quot;  She blinked and he stuck his long tongue out at her.  Shaking her head, she just shoved the joker&#39;s back as she hopped off his saddle.  Waving a hand at him dismissively, she stepped up to her car and opened the door.  &quot;I&#39;m just saying,&quot; he went on, sniffing the air.  &quot;Prolly wanna make sure.  Once is probably not enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; she rolled her eyes.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, honey... I&#39;ll make sure to put some kits and or cubs in ya,&quot; reached in, handing him half the total containers from the back seat.  Meanwhile, Drevor reached to his underbelly and tried to pull up the black-colored boxer-briefs she&#39;d created for him with a front hand-paw.  He tried to reposition himself, though his cookie and balls both rubbed against the inside of his thighs as he moved.  The briefs now reached to almost to his front legs with drawstring keeping them tight around his underbelly.  Undistracted by the tightness of his underwear, his mate went on: &quot;Still thinking about what to do with Tom, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  That&#39;s really a tough one,&quot; he was forced to agree.  &quot;I think I have to defer to you, though.  It&#39;s close.  One part of me keeps thinking about all the things that could be done with that Emitter, and the other part of me understands what the kid tried to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those parts have names...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s the first thing I&#39;m gunna try to do: cutback on invoking Trevor or David.  Excluding when dealing directly with people who think I&#39;m one or the other,&quot; he said, taking the other half of the food as she offered it to him.  &quot;Speaking of... I bet Chester is going to want to be a Chakat... not sure of the legal workings of that...&quot; He glanced at me for the first time in a long while.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to risk it even with them existing elsewhere on the cyocLayer.  But hey, maybe a Future author will name them as such.  &quot;And then there&#39;s the Ronan—the PI Trevor hired—he saw a Dragon on the property...&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly&#39;s eyes met Drevor&#39;s.  &quot;I thought Ronan was being weird,&quot; she confessed.  Sighing, she moved towards the front of the house.  Finding the front door unlocked, she pushed it open and stepped inside.  &quot;Kids!&quot; she called out, hearing them playing Donkey Kong Country 3 downstairs.  &quot;Food&#39;s finally here!  Bring up Thor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; came both their voices at once.  The thump-thumping of hard footfalls could be heard as they rushed up the stairs, both appearing at the entrance to the basement at the same time.  They almost fell over each other as they saw the kistune standing there.  Alice was about to ask what had happened when Drevor appeared in the doorway holding the other pizza&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Little eleven-year-old Tom&#39;s eyes went wide as he saw his new father alive.  &quot;You made it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dire wolftaur nodded as he moved to the kitchen area and started setting up the dozen or so different boxes in stacks of the same toppings.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; Drevor nodded.  &quot;You saw how it started, so, yeah, your mom is <i>way</i> stronger than me as a protagonist,&quot; he chuckled, glancing my way.  &quot;But, eventually, I was able to reason with her.&quot;  He looked over at Holly.  &quot;We&#39;re going to see if this can work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Alice blinked, glancing at her brother with her green eyes.  She looked like she wanted to say something, but then didn&#39;t.  Instead, she hurried over to the pizzas that her mother was reheating with teal fire and asked for a slice of pepperoni.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thor?&quot; The bulky wolf creature asked the little girl.  Blinking, she moved away from the countertop to hurry back down stairs.  &quot;Careful!&quot; he called after her as she left.  &quot;And Tommy...&quot;  The boy looked at his square-jawed father.  &quot;Tom, sorry again—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy is fine,&quot; his son revealed.  &quot;Tom, Tommy, Thomas.  Not picky.  It&#39;s just... I still have all these extra years in my head.&quot;  With that, he moved towards the countertop where the Pizza Hut food was all laid out.<br />
<br />
Drevor nodded.  &quot;Understood.&quot;  The wolf took a plate of Supreme and laid two thin square slices upon it before handing it to his cub.  &quot;You should know... Your mother and I have agreed, and... after she&#39;s used some of her healing upon me, I&#39;ve decided I can&#39;t be impartial when dishing out the punishment you still have coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice returned from the downstairs with the German. Shepherd.  She closed the basement door behind her since near to the room he&#39;d been in was a still broken door from where Holly had put Drevor through it earlier.  She took up a seat at one of the stools at the counter and began eating from her requested pepperoni piece.<br />
<br />
Tommy sighed, and his mom leaned in to her mate&#39;s side, hugging one arm around his back as she did so.  Speaking with a firm but caring tone, she expressed her agreement.  &quot;Little Tom, I&#39;m to understand you gave yourself a number of years with your old father, Trevor and that... that may have influenced you to take the action you did.&quot;  Thomas hadn&#39;t considered that, but it was possible.  If he hadn&#39;t aged himself would he still have thought it was a good idea?  In any event, he simply nodded, letting his mother speak.  &quot;You&#39;ve got a lot to learn, and A&#39;s to make, but before you get back to school you&#39;ll have to serve a punishment I put forth.&quot;  There became a little glowing teal glint of mischief within Holly&#39;s emerald slitted eyes.  &quot;It will involve a change of body, though temporary and—as your father explains it—<i>no</i> TF style for you to suffer through with your newly discovered phobia.  I wouldn&#39;t dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
The child looked from his mom, to his dad who gave him a &#39;don&#39;t look at me, look at her&#39; look and pointed to his vixen.  He glanced at Alice who shrugged with an &#39;I toldja so&#39; look.  Finally, his eyes met his mother&#39;s directly.  &quot;OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly Phillips frowned at her kit.  &quot;Don&#39;t &#39;OK&#39; like this was something you got pressured to agree to, mister.  This is a punishment and is not up for debate.&quot;  She allowed herself a low growl from her throat.  &quot;I&#39;m going to think on what you&#39;ve done...&quot; she trailed off.  &quot;It was horrible,&quot; was all she said without once again repeating &#39;you killed two men&#39; which was a recommendation by Drevor for this interaction.  Her intention should have been enough to clue the boy in, however, and it had the benefit of not speaking aloud Drevor&#39;s traumatic experience once more.  &quot;As such, it will not be light.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence broken by Alice saying &quot;Whoa, dad.&quot;  She was watching him swallow a folded slice of pizza whole.  Holly turned her head and watched with interest, making sure to inquire about how much he could fit down his throat later... for science.<br />
<br />
Holly poked Drevor in the side.  &quot;Don&#39;t teach our kits to choke on food.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolftaur chuckled, reaching for another slice.  &quot;I&#39;m not.&quot;  He looked between the two children.  &quot;You guys know your bodies aren&#39;t designed for this, yeah?&quot;  It was a question asked while picking up another slice and quickly chomping off the end of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Alice said, smiling.  &quot;Can I...&quot; the eight-year-old glanced at her brother, then back to both her parents.  &quot;Can I be a wolftaur like dad now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a Kitsune?&quot; Tom asked after swallowing a bit.  &quot;Mom&#39;s stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.  Not <i>everything</i> is about being stronker &#39;Little Tom&#39;,&quot; Alice said with a bit of a sneer, unlike her old self.  Maybe there was still a bit of dominate wolf within her?  &quot;I wanna be a wolftaur like dad... with magical abilities like mom?  And!  And... can I have memories... experience?&quot; she asked, then smiled cordially.  &quot;You could have taken away Tom&#39;s five more years, but didn&#39;t.  I&#39;d like something like that—&quot; she caught a side-glance from her mother. &quot;—if that&#39;s OK,&quot; she finished her thought, eyes somewhat looking away from the alpha female.  &quot;Like, why&#39;s he get to be older?  I was good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly sighed, putting a hand to her forehead as she found herself considering it.  &quot;We&#39;ll think about it,&quot; the kitsune relented.  &quot;Imbuing children with more knowledge beyond their years can lead to unforeseen consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have lots to think about,&quot; Drevor conceded.  &quot;Probably&#39;ll need a bigger house,&quot; he said, glancing toward Holly without explaining the need for a bigger family home.  &quot;Anyway... eat up.  I&#39;m gunna have to feed the animals again soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thor was already having an unseasoned chicken wing at the side of the counter space.  It was clear, though, that his nose was distracted by the sweet scent of Drevor&#39;s heat... but he was being a good dog... only the crowning of his canine rod would indicate otherwise.  It&#39;s not like the male had never resisted a female in heat while on the job before.  The seven-year-old was a professional K9 after all...<br />
<br />
The rest of the early afternoon was filled with food and games: JackBox, Uno, and so on.  Holly had a lot on her plate now, but for the moment, it seemed like she was sticking with Drevor.  All-in-all, the start of something unique was underway at the old Scott farm.  Who knew how things were going to turn out...</p>
