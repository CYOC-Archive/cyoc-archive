<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The last thing Kase was expecting to see in his room was... well just about everything inside it.<br />
<br />
He toyed around with his phone and smiled at a couple of photos on his dating profile. Some of the girls he was suggested to be with were absolutely gorgeous. Especially this one girl named Frieda, she was posed all cute in her picture with a shirt on that gave him a nice view of her cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, I would love to see those puppies all barren,” Kase chuckled before opening his door and feeling his jaw drop.<br />
<br />
He glanced between his phone and the girl in his room, they were the same person. Long beautiful brown hair, gorgeous perky breasts wrapped up in a long sleeved V-neck shirt, and cute grey eyes that looked up at him from where she was working at his roommate Fred’s desk.<br />
<br />
“Uhhh...” he trailed while pointing at her, glancing at the room number to make sure he had the right place. “Who... who are you and what are you doing in my room?”<br />
<br />
“Your room?” Frieda asked in confusion while Kase walked in and was convinced even further he had the wrong place. His side of the room was fully clean, his messes and pile of takeout containers he’d planned to take out a few days ago were gone, and his bedsheets were totally clean and a little girly.<br />
<br />
“You related to my roommate? His sister or something,” Kase asked while tossing his backpack onto his bed.<br />
<br />
“I don’t have any siblings,” Frieda replied with a shake of his head.<br />
<br />
“Ah, so a cousin then,” Kase grinned while eying up the girl’s body. “You cleaned this space up nice.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, were those your disgusting piles of clothes, yeah I cleaned em all up,” Frieda explained with a point towards the closet.<br />
<br />
“You did my laundry?!” Kase laughed while approaching the dresser and opening it wide. His smile faltered as he looked over the contents. “I think you filled these with your clothes.”<br />
<br />
“I just washed them,” Frieda shrugged matter of factly before turning back to her work.<br />
<br />
“Oh really!” Kase shouted while pulling a deep red bra from his drawers and waving it around for her to see. “Does this look like... mine...”<br />
<br />
The bra was soft on his fingers and he ran his thumbs over the fabric while staring at it, his breathing slow. He really liked the feel of that bra, in fact he liked it so much he wanted to feel it on his chest. He couldn’t explain the motion but he quickly stripped his shirt off his body and brought the bra up against his barren chest, holding it up against his skin as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
That was actually kind of hard because his chest was ballooning outwards into the bra, filling up the cups with generous amounts of cleavage and pushing his hands further away. When the growth finally stopped he was left clutching that red bra up against a pit of voluptuous breasts cupped between his fingers. The bra felt so soft when pressed up against his boobies and he smiled kind of vacantly for a few seconds before reaching behind him to clasp the bra on.<br />
<br />
“See, your clothes,” Frieda announced from across the room.<br />
<br />
“Yeah... they are my clothes,” Kase smiled before frowning and noticing the shirt Frieda was wearing. “Hey! That’s mine!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, am I wearing your shirt?” Frieda asked in sarcastic innocence. “I just found it on the floor, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“Give it!” Kase exclaimed before rushing over to Frieda and grabbing the bottom of the shirt. He struggled against her for a few seconds before peeling the shirt off her body and exposing her bra underneath. “You’re wearing my bra too!”<br />
<br />
“Not my fault we’re the same size,” Frieda replied with a brush of her hair behind her head. Kase held his hand out angrily and Frieda sighed before reaching behind her and unclamping the bra. Her breasts fell free and open just like Kase had been wishing a few moment ago and handed him the bra.<br />
<br />
“Stop wearing my clothes,” Kase growled before pulling the shirt Frieda had been wearing over her head. It was tight but his shoulders and limbs slimmed down until they fit it snugly. When his head popped out from the neckline his features had changed, his hair was long and coloured a deep chestnut while his face was feminine and covered in makeup.<br />
<br />
“Psssh, whatever,” Frieda muttered before Kase cleared his throat and she groaned in annoyance stripping off her socks, panties, and jeans. Kase tossed the underwear aside with the bra but discarded his own filthy jeans, socks, and unclean underwear for those long socks Frieda had been wearing, a pair of panties that matched the bra and the skinny jeans.<br />
<br />
It was all tight but with each article of clothing Kase became more girly. His dick withdrew into his body, his ass flared out in a lovely fashion, and he stopped regarding himself as Kase. She was Kasey and her roommate had gotten into her clothes again.<br />
<br />
“There, you have your clothes back, at least thank me for washing it all,” Frieda requested in a catty tone.<br />
<br />
“Put on some clothes you slut,” Kasey ordered before hopping on her bed and wrinkling all the freshly washed sheets. “You cleaned my bedding too?! Respect privacy much?!”<br />
<br />
“Whatever,” Frieda muttered before opening her own closet and finding it filled with guy clothes. “Ugh, these are filthy.”<br />
<br />
They really weren’t but she seemed to think so. She spent the next few minutes sorting her clothes out into piles and when she was about to leave she brushed her hair back and stared down Kasey.<br />
<br />
“So can I borrow some clothes until mine are clean?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Kasey proclaimed in annoyance. “You can wander down the halls naked as punishment for messing with my stuff.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe I wouldn’t mess with your stuff if you actually cleaned your half of the room once in a while,” Frieda muttered before lugging her first load up and walking out into the hallway completely naked, only covered by a pile of clothes as she made her way to the laundry room again.</p>
