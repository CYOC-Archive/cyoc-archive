<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Kelly had made her wish, she wasn&#39;t sure at first at what was happening. <br />
<br />
Within an instant, she&#39;d appeared in the throne room. Instead of seeing say a giant version of her room outside, she&#39;d seem a forest below of giant flowers and glowing plants that stretched out as she watched, expanding and pushing back a wall of fog. It was like her merely being here had added to the world. <br />
<br />
The throne room itself was a round shape in the central tower, with Kelly&#39;s pink and pearls throne set facing inwards with the back to on of the windows... that now showed a stain glass depiction of her as she now was. Kelly did note that there was room for several more thrones, each with an empty window behind it. &#39;For future fairy princesses.&#39; Kelly dimly thought. There could be anymore from a few to a baker&#39;s dozen. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d found a full length mirror, and was shocked at her own appearance. She hadn&#39;t aged at all, but there were plenty of other changes. Her blue eyes were now completely blue with no centers or whites and almost shone. Her brown hair that had been neck length before now went down her back in a braid (she liked that). Her skin was fairer, and her figure seemed more slim and lithe, but not weaker. The little girl of course noticed the large beautiful pastel wings that were exactly as she&#39;d wish them to be. Her face itself was now more slim and pretty, not quite human, but not inhuman. She still had freckles. Her ears would be pointed. <br />
<br />
As is the tradition with such things as Kelly was the first, Kelly&#39;s dress was primarily pink, like the castle itself and the majority of the great flowers outside. It sparkled, and had a generous amount of ribbons, and was accented with beautiful pearls (she&#39;d like those better than diamonds). It was exactly the kind of dress a little girl would love. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d stepped out onto the indoor balcony connected to the throne room, showing the ballroom below. <br />
<br />
All her fairy dolls were there, include the Ken and Barbie dolls who had been turned into fairy dolls by the playset&#39;s magic. Though their modern clothes had changed to fit the high fantasy theme of the place. Ken dressed as a shining armored fairy guard, while Barbie was dressed as a lady-in-waiting. Her various other dolls filled different role for a castle to run smoothly, chef, seamstress, chambermaids, and others, Kelly had yet to know the names for yet. <br />
<br />
They&#39;d all cheered for her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The first of our princesses has been reborn and returned to us!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a miracle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tis truly her! Part of the dark fog has lifted!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome home Princess Kelly!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;May the rest of your sisters return to us as well!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome home to the Princess Fairies Mega Palace, Your Royal Highness.&quot; Said a blond fairy in a green dress with her blond hair down and butterfly wings. <br />
<br />
Kelly let out a faint gasp as she looked at the fairy next to her. &quot;Tinkerbell?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me my Princess, my name is Lady Twinklebell. And has been since the day I was born.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lady Twinklebell curtsied before her princess. <br />
<br />
It was too much. The transformation, the palace, her cheering dolls, her wish come true. <br />
<br />
Princess Kelly could cry scared or confused, or yell with overwhelming joy and glee at getting to live the fantasy any little girl who&#39;d lived more than five year had had at one point in their lives. <br />
<br />
Princess Kelly decided she prefer the latter option. She jumped in the air, kicked her feet together (only now realizing she was bare foot) and flew about the ballroom as easily as if she&#39;d flown all her life. <br />
<br />
She flew out one of the many windows, did kart wheels and loop de loops, laughing and giggling. Lady Twinklebell was quick to follow, and imitated her princess. <br />
<br />
Princess Kelly flew down to the giant mushrooms and flowers that lay at the ground of her kingdom. She flew over a body of water leaving a powerful wake behind her, not getting wet from the force of her flight, still laughing. <br />
<br />
She then flew with Sir Kenith and Miss Barbara. She spun, and let the sun shine through her wings, creating colorful patterns beneath her. Princess Kelly couldn&#39;t remember feeling so free, so alive. <br />
<br />
As her subjects swarmed in beautiful patterns, Lady Twinklebell spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will confess my Princess, when the Palace itself was cleared of the dark fog, and we were reborn, and you were not you nor any of your sisters were there to greet us, we feared that we were doomed to have only the Palace as our sanctuary from the dark fog, but with your rebirth and return, those fear was melted away like mist under the morning daylight.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was an awe inspiring thought for Princess Kelly what Lady Twinklebell was telling her. <br />
<br />
&quot;But as more of your sisters return Princess Kelly, I am sure more of our kingdom will return!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was awkward for Princess Kelly, since she knew she didn&#39;t have any sisters. But... the idea excited her, and she felt herself filled with the [i]need[/i] to fill the throne room, as something that [i]needed[/i] to happen. <br />
<br />
Princess Kelly held Lady Twinklebell&#39;s hands, fluttering close. &quot;I promise Lady Twinklebell, I will see all of my sisters reborn, and we&#39;ll drive back complete the dark fog!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lady Twinklebell hugged her in midair, the two staying aloft. &quot;Thank you My Princes! I know you will!&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a spark in Lady Twinklebell&#39;s eyes were before they&#39;d been &#39;empty&#39;. <br />
<br />
Princess Kelly hadn&#39;t noticed before, but when she first arrived, the other fairies had had plastic looking skin, their expressions unchanging, their voices almost monotone, and their motions had been, well, doll like.<br />
<br />
But as she had been in this world, that had changed, their skin had become less and less plastic like, their expression and voice more ranged, their more natural and more well, alive. <br />
<br />
It was like her love, attention, and imagination caused them to become &#39;more real&#39; the longer she interacted with them. What was stranger was how she hadn&#39;t notice until AFTER they&#39;d become more living. <br />
<br />
When Princess eventually Kelly returned to the throne room, she found a letter addressed to her laying on her throne. <br />
<br />
[i]&#39;Greetings To Her Royal Highness of the Fae, Princess Kelly,<br />
<br />
It was not expected that you would chose yourself to become one of the fairy princesses.<br />
<br />
As owner of the play-set in the human world, your actions as you played with your dolls would manifest as the unseen force of fate in the fairy world.<br />
<br />
Nor did I expect that you&#39;d go for the simple and obvious solution of using your own dolls to act as your palace&#39;s servers. You have surprised me greatly Princess Kelly, and this old man, that is something of a rare treat. <br />
<br />
But what is done, cannot be undone, and you are now the first of the fairy princesses. Normally this would create a paradox, but I&#39;ve done some workings.<br />
<br />
As you are the rightful owner of the play-set in the human world, you have the unique power to exist in both worlds, and unlike others to remember your former human life, to come and go as you please, rather than only being able to have existed in one world.<br />
<br />
As normally those who become fairies in this world, cannot also exist in the human world. This way, no one is missed in the human world. Due to your unexpected wish however, you are now unique and can have a life in both worlds if you desire it.&#39;<br />
<br />
Signed, The Wizard of Spells &#39;R&#39; Us.<br />
<br />
P.S. Only those who were human in the human world can become fairy princesses in this world.&#39;<br />
<br />
Princess Kelly remember her friends Iris and Amanda, they&#39;d love this, she knew they would. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Twinklebell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my Princess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be going on a quest to find some of my sisters.&quot;</p>
