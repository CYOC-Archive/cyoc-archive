<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some things buzzed through my mind with great surprise. Terri's father had returned and she hadn't been kicked out? Night's boyfriend had arrived, and seemingly &quot;knew&quot; everything. A lot of that seemed to be too much. The revelation of old high school friends being werewolves was surprising, but Devon was the bigger issue. We would still be expected to meet with Devon tonight as he had demanded. A good part of me was perfectly willing to fight him, for all that he'd done wrong. But, the other part was nervous over Devon's power and experience, and the worry that the rest of his pack might rally to him, ensuring that Terri and Night couldn't help in an actual fight... and it was too late to ask David and Nate to bring their pack down for backup.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you keep normal humans from seeing all that?&quot; Fred asked to Night, still looking a bit surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;The website includes a main questionnaire and log in,&quot; Night answered, &quot;The answers are all answers that would be known by actual werewolves... either through experience or through explanation. It's then followed by a log in to an established account. Normal humans can look at the site, but without the right information, all they have is a forum page. There are some multimedia outlets, artwork, and stories that end up there, but it's generally treated as a fan-site for werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then made our way back toward the kitchen and dinning room, where Terri and Kevin were waiting. As I arrived I was seized by a question that I had based on what I'd been told by them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Terri, when did your dad get home?&quot; I asked, &quot;I thought he wasn't do back for another week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He apparently had some car trouble and left early,&quot; Terri sighed, &quot;it still runs, as he made it back, but he couldn't go very fast. He was so POed by that that he went to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I then called Kevin to come and work on the car,&quot; Night added, &quot;and while he got started, the three of us had a rather long talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you told him about your long term plan? With...&quot; I began.<br />
<br />
&quot;With you, me, and Terri?&quot; Night asked, &quot;Yes. And the way things are going with Devon, I had to. It took the website to get him to believe the whole werewolf thing... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't get mad over me...&quot; I began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mind, Mr. Will,&quot; Kevin spoke, &quot;sad I suppose, that I wouldn't get a shot... but I want Night to be happy. A beautiful woman like her deserves it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why haven't you called your brother?&quot; I then wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be more my fault,&quot; Night answered, &quot;Given Devon's actions, if Kevin talked with his brother while dating me, he might have eventually crossed paths with Devon when he made sure that I didn't bite him to attack his harem. Devon had no problem with you having sex with Terri while you were human, but his suspicions were raised when she began requesting to bring you in. I didn't want Kevin attacked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully, when Devon is either taken down a notch, things will settle down,&quot; Kevin commented, &quot;things will get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was about to say something, when my cellphone rang. I'd only just sat down at the table and sighed heavily. I pulled out my phone to send it to voice-mail, but the phone had a display of who was calling me. I gave a gulp and answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice trick with the cops freshie,&quot; came Devon's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Murderer,&quot; I growled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I am still Terri and Night's Alpha, and thus I am also YOUR Alpha,&quot; Devon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And killing old women is going to protect you?&quot; I demanded, &quot;you know the cops will hunt you down!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... maybe they'll confuse you for me and shoot you, and I'll get away,&quot; Devon answered, &quot;I always have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this time, I swear it!&quot; I growled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such an attitude from a freshie!&quot; Devon answered, &quot;I was going to cut you some slack for not having sex with my wife... but now... I suppose you'll really get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even with the cops chasing you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won't be getting us, not tonight anyway,&quot; Devon answered, &quot;but since you called them on me, the pack won't be meeting at my residence tonight. Tell Night and Terri that we'll meet at the old rock quarry south of town. And be quick. You have only a couple of hours from moon rise.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and then hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Devon, I take it?&quot; Terri asked.<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;He mentioned something about the cops,&quot; Night said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't want the cops called?&quot; Fred blurted, &quot;after he murdered my WIFE?! Admittedly they may need silver bullets but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't immune to everything but silver,&quot; Terri said, &quot;that's a myth. I have a pair of silver earrings I wear all the time. Lycanthropy is is a virus. A gun, a knife, anything that can kill a human can kill a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it wasn't to mean any disrespect to your wife,&quot; Night added carefully, &quot;the plan that Kevin, Terri, and I created depended on making an anonymous call to the police just before dawn. Since he's likely to beat John up as a show of dominance, and may even beat Terri and I, we'd probably be away from him and the rest of the pack or in a position where it would look like we'd been abused. The police would arrive at Devon's house and if he fights, he'd be shot... especially if they're still in wolf form. With Devon and his wife dead, the Pack would have no Alphas. Which would make John, the only other male the most logical successor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the police detective said he'd set all of his &quot;girls&quot; free,&quot; Fred spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but the concept of slavery to him is not the &quot;we're locked in a dungeon and raped&quot; thing,&quot; Terri answered, &quot;he is the Alpha and with regard to Pack matters, his word is law. We're all free to go around and even leave Fangton. A couple of girls left a few months ago because they were afraid of him. Last we found online, they'd found a couple of boys in Klawthorn they liked. It's why having them raid Devon's house close to sunrise would work the best. All of his &quot;girls&quot; would be there in one place. By calling the cops yourselves, the pack will meet elsewhere and in an area that would either implicate all of us if caught or will not be noticed by the police... and while they will eventually catch and likely kill Devon, it will not end the investigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred looked a little sheepish, &quot;The hospital called the police. They wanted to know how I was wounded, and I told them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you watched him kill your wife?&quot; Night asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, my wife is DEAD because of him,&quot; Fred gave a growl back, &quot;and apparently, you're going into a three-way with John and your present boyfriend is still alive. I think I am entitled be in a little bit of shock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was to make this anonymous call, anyway?&quot; I asked, trying to get things away from a possible fight between Night and Fred.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was me,&quot; Kevin spoke, &quot;there's an old pay phone a couple of blocks away. The plan was for me to use it as a tip and then return here where I can guard Terri's dad and Mr. Jones, here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't he a werewolf, too?&quot; Fred asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Terri answered, &quot;all of the werewolves here were bitten. Night was bitten by Devon or by one of his other Pack members, Night bit me, and I bit John.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how would you stop any werewolf that might decide to sneak here to get revenge during the night while were' getting beat up by Devon?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a very good shotgun in the garage, which I brought with me,&quot; Kevin answered, &quot;Fred, you could use it while I make the call... BUT if Devon's changed the meeting place, that won't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can still protect them,&quot; Night sighed, &quot;Given that he spied on Terri and John the night Terri bit him, and now killed an innocent to show his dominance, he likely will send one of the girls here to finish the job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do werewolves change back to human form after being killed, like they do in movies?&quot; Fred wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't know,&quot; Terri said slowly, &quot;there have been starved werewolves that have probably been shot, but so far, none in Fangton, and most of the times when it has happened, it's never been on camera... so if it does, no one's seen it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about fights between werewolves?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The winners don't really talk,&quot; Night answered, &quot;not even online... though some of them are also Civil War veterans and don't understand computers all that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only sighed. Things were getting very complex very rapidly, and the clock was ticking down toward sunset and the last full moon of the month.</p>
