<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean blinked.  The dawn's gray light was seeping through the crack between the shade and the window. He sat <br />
up.  The restraints were gone.  So were his clothes, and so was his cock and balls.  He ran his fingers over <br />
the smoothness between his legs.  His body was now hairless from the neck down.  No pit hairs, no pubic hairs, <br />
no chest hairs, no hairs on his legs or arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Sammy and Adam, when I get my hands on you,&quot; he said standing up and punching his palm with his fist.  He <br />
looked around.  He was in a different building.  This one had been vacant a very long time. The mattress he <br />
had been lying on had long since starved the vermin that lived in it to death.  Everything about the house was <br />
dead and dusty. He touched the shade to peek out, and it disintegrated. He tried an old sheet that had covered <br />
a chair, but the fabric was so rotted that it soon was reduced to shreds by his movements.  &quot;I never was a <br />
toga guy,&quot; he commented dryly as he discarded the sheet.  He finally spotted something near the derelict house <br />
that provided promise: a scarecrow stood among the dead neglected stalks of what had been decades earlier a <br />
cornfield. <br />
<br />
Dean tugged the weathered denim coveralls over his muscled smooth body while the straw hat rested cockeyed on <br />
his head.  He nodded at the burlap sack dummy filled with straw that had once worn his new clothes, and said, <br />
&quot;It's a tight fit, but it'll do, chum.  Thanks. Hope ya don't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do mind!&quot; snapped a voice from behind him.<br />
<br />
He spun around and looked down.  It was a wimpy high school boy in a white shirt and blue jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we need a scarecrow or our crop will be ruined!&quot; he said emphatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I hate to disappoint you, but no scarecrow is going to save that corn crop,&quot; Dean said gesturing.<br />
<br />
The boy rolled his eyes, and he reached out and grabbed Dean with one hand and hefted him over his shoulder <br />
and carried him to the vacant pole from which the scarecrow had hung.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof! How'd you do that?&quot; Dean gasped in disbelief as he found himself hung up on the pole as the boy's new <br />
scarecrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My you really are a dickless wonder aren't you?&quot; the boy remarked with a chuckle.  His hand patted the huge <br />
bulge in the boy's jeans. Dean cringed he could feel a hand patting his cock and balls wherever they were.  He <br />
stared down at the boy's package. He shook his head.  &quot;Oh, you're not a total moron then.  You figured out I'm <br />
the one with the balls here?  Yes, they used to be your balls, but they feel so good, so I'll just be keeping <br />
them.&quot; He started to scratch his crotch, and Dean moaned.  He chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! How?  Why?&quot;  Dean shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, save it for the crows, scarecrow,&quot; the boy said.  He nodded over to an empty pedestal between the house <br />
and the cornfield. &quot;I stood there for over 100 years.  There used to be a fountain around the pedestal. I was <br />
the pissing youth statue, and crows would roost on my stone cock.  Finally, it snapped off under the weight of <br />
a particularly fat fowl. That was maybe 40 or 50 years ago.  The farm's been abandoned since the Great <br />
Depression.  Then one day a man came along, and started talking to me.  Now mind you as carved stone I was <br />
only dimly aware of things, but he held out a lump of flesh and pressed it to my damaged groin. Suddenly, I <br />
was thinking clearly, I was no longer stone - I was flesh and bone.  Then he gave me some shorts to wear and I <br />
helped him unload a large crate from his truck.  Inside the crate was you.  A hard plastic display model to <br />
promote some action figure I thought.  Having been a statue for so long in the middle of nowhere, I suppose <br />
that was an odd thought to have, but I had it all the same.  I picked up a lot of knowledge over the years. <br />
Kids played with GI Joe action figures around the backyard, and I figured you were a promotional version to <br />
display in stores.  'Cepting of course you weren't, and you were.  Apparently, you had spent the last six <br />
months as store mannequin promoting a GI Joe movie.  But your skin started to shimmer and you moved.  You were <br />
still inanimate, but somehow seemed to be becoming alive.  The man explained you would be alive after a <br />
fashion in a day or week or month because your manhood was alive again.  He explained you were alive this <br />
whole time, just immovable.  If you concentrate real hard, you will remember that it's all true.  What you <br />
think was a vague dream was in fact your life for the past year or so.  You broke into a wax works, and you <br />
and your cohorts were reshaped to serve useful purposes - well, at least useful as that man saw it. Then he <br />
saw me, and gave you to me. I think a scarecrow is the best use for you for the moment.  So hang in there, <br />
Deano, I'll be back to see how you're doing around noon.  Maybe I'll even bring you lunch!&quot; <br />
<br />
The kid spun around and started hiking off through the dead corn to who knows where.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, kid! You can't leave me here!&quot; Dean shouted.<br />
<br />
He heard the flapping of wings and a crow landed on his arm.  Dean raised his arm and the crow flew away. Dean <br />
blinked.  He did remember being naked and then hands dressing him and propping him up on a stand next to a <br />
cardboard cut-out of Iron Man. He was GI Joe - Movie Theater Mannequin.  He felt sick.  Wait there had been a <br />
wax works.  He had been jacking off. Then he had been gagged with his -ooh, ooh, ooh, aaaah, ooh! Dean's cock <br />
wherever it was was getting jacked off, and Dean found it terribly distracting.  No not jacked off, the kid <br />
was having sex with it.  It felt good.  Sweat covered Dean's smooth flesh with a slick coating. He shook his <br />
head. He recalled being the Red Hood dressed as the former Batman sidekick turned from hero to villain. He <br />
felt his feet moved as he recalled all the Red Hood's athletic acrobatic prowess.  The soles of his bare feet <br />
propelled him up the pole and he launched himself airborne and off the pole.  He landed in a classic gymnastic <br />
dismount on both feet.  He was no longer a scarecrow. Or was he?  He rubbed the empty space between his <br />
thighs. Perhaps the answer lay with the statue?  He headed toward the pedestal. Through the brush growing <br />
around it, Dean could make out a letter &quot;P&quot;.  He strode closer. He reached down and spread the foliage and <br />
read the inscription on the decayed plaque.</p>
