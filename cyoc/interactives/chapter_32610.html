<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Authors note: This is the same chapter as Paul's Collapse and &quot;Dream&quot; with a few minor mistakes that I failed to notice corrected.*<br />
<br />
<br />
As Paul, Chan, and Hannah left the girls locker room Paul couldn't help but wonder what Hannah was going to say before she left off. Was it more of her story or something else? To Paul it didn't matter much, he was just relieved that he wasn't going to lose himself. He may be stuck in this body for now but if what Hannah said is true then he'll be able to change back into himself if he can find the medallion.<br />
<br />
When they entered the dance room Paul's mother came up to them and said &quot;Miss Thompson, your parents called me and asked if I would look after you and your sister for a few days. I told them that I would so they will be bringing some of your stuff and your sister here in a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Mrs. Miller&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Did they tell you why they were asking you to look after me and my sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were called out of town suddenly&quot; Paul's mother answered. By this time all the other girls had come out and she said &quot;Alright girls, line up and let's begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all lined up at the bar with Paul right up in front at a lower bar. A few minutes into the class Paul heard someone come in and in the mirrors he saw a fifteen year old girl with some bags sit down in back. He figured that this must be Hannah's sister.<br />
<br />
As the class progressed Paul started to feel a tingling sensation in his head. He started to wonder what was happening when all of a sudden he just collapsed to the floor. The last things he heard before losing consciousness was Hannah muttering some strange words and his mother yelling &quot;Paula!&quot;.<br />
<br />
The next thing Paul knew was he was in his room. He was standing there in the middle without having any idea how he came to be there. There was something strange though, he no longer thought of himself as he but now she and had memories of being a girl. That's when his old body came into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is weird&quot; Paul's old body said. Paul could understand why it was weird. Not only was he looking at his old body but at the same time he was looking at his new body through what seemed to be his old body's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on here?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain&quot; Hannah said as she walked into the room. &quot;You're not really at home in your room. You're at the dance studio in your mothers office laying on a couch. This is your mind we're in. The two of you are the memories of your lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Memories?&quot; Paul's old body asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes memories&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is a dream?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't a dream&quot; Hannah said. &quot;It's like a dream but with more awareness than a dream. You won't be forgetting it like you usually do with a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you explain how I'm seeing through her eyes&quot; Paul's old body said indicating Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said before the two of you are the memories of your lives&quot; Hannah said. &quot;You're still the same person which is why you can see through each others eyes.&quot; Paul's old body and Paul looked at each other with a sceptical look on their faces. &quot;I know this sounds a little strange to you but think about your transformation. If you hadn't of gone through it you would have thought I was making up a story about my transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul had to agree with that and asked &quot;Is this why I'm thinking of myself as Paula now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; Hannah said &quot;and we'll refer to you as Paula and to your old body as Paul from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You went through the same thing didn't you?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did&quot; Hannah replied. &quot;Now then like I said before this house is your mind. In here, or in someone else's mind is where you will see yourselves as your memories. In a dream you'll mostly see yourself as Paula. Now Paul you might be wondering why the room looks like Paula's instead of your's.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The question did cross my mind&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine too&quot; Paula said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because your physical body is now Paula&quot; a guy said walking into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Paula and Paul asked at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick&quot; Hannah and the guy answered at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the memories of what used to be Hannah&quot; Rick said. &quot;You may have noticed that you both asked the same question at the same time and we answered the same at the same time. That's because you two are actually the same person and so are we.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get into our mind?&quot; Paula asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've learned how to do from Hannah's parents&quot; Rick replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll teach you how to do it too if you would like&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah you know you can't teach them that without Mom and Dad's permission&quot; the same fifteen year old girl that Paul/Paula saw in the dance room said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny&quot; Hannah whined, &quot;I told you I could handle this. I've been through it, you haven't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe you can and maybe you can't&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I'm here just in case you need a little help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine stay if you want&quot; Hannah said. She then turned to Paul and Paula and said &quot;Now then Paula is the dominate one right now so it will be her memories that you'll have an easier time accessing when you're not here. You'll still be able to access Paul's memories but they will be a little harder to access. Now when you wake up your mother will remember Paul but like with you her memories of Paul will be harder to access then her memories of Paula.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did that happen?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you collapsed it gave me the opportunity to cast a spell to let her notice the reality change&quot; Hannah said. &quot;By the way I'm sorry I didn't get to warn you about the collapse. You see you collapsed because Paula's memories came in swiftly. The same thing happened to me when Hannah's memories came in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you learn to cast a spell?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to learn to cast spells too&quot; Paula whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our parents are mystics&quot; Hannah said. &quot;They've taught us what we know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chan had said that the medallion I picked up wasn't the one that she had left for her cousin&quot; Paul said. &quot;So what medallion was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's called the Medallion of Zulo&quot; Hannah said. &quot;A powerful shaman of the M'barduu tribe in Central Africa during the ninth century made fifty medallions that could transform people and dedicated them to the tribes trickster god Zulo. The medallions were able to allow those that wore them to transform into someone else by touching a piece of clothing to it. If the clothing had been worn then they would transform into whoever had worn that piece of clothing and gain their skills and some of their personality. If the clothing hadn't been worn before then they would transform into someone who would wear that piece of clothing. That's what happened to us though the one we touched had a bit more added to it sometime after it's creation. Originally the medallions couldn't alter reality but this one can now. You're starting to stir so this is all I can tell you for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paula's vision faded to black and when she opened her eyes she saw her mother smiling down at her.</p>
