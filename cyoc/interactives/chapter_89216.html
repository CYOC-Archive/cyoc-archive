<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew started getting the tattoos damp for Dani and helping to apply them straight. Once applied Dani looked utterly ridiculous. A foamy beer on one bicep and a muscle torso and barbed wire band on the other arm. To top it off black ink speckled his face in a pathetic imitation of beard stubble. Andrew took a step back once done and laughed before suddenly getting excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh! I totally got this! You! You&#39;re a... A... Frat boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Dani asked in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the guy at the college who goes to all the parties and takes home all the girls with your devilishly good looks... after drinking all the beer of course...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani was nervously laughing cause he didn&#39;t understand. &quot;What are you even talking about?&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew was having fun with the role playing so he grabbed Dani&#39;s face and pointed it to the mirror. Stepping behind Dani he pointed to the stubble and went back over the role he had created adding that he was probably a jock stoner to some degree with the rebellious barbed wire armband. <br />
<br />
Dani got the picture finally and smiled, his tendency to take everything literally and at face value could sometimes be annoying but Andrew had more than enough imagination to make up for it. Accepting Andrews image was an unlikely source of curiosity for Dani, he imagined being a wild, carefree, popular, jock who expressed no concern for ten minutes from now, let alone, ten years from now. It was so uncharacteristic that Dani laughed and kissed his biceps in accordance to the character he imagined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for you!&quot; Dani said glancing at Andrew as he grabbed the sheets with renewed vigor. A few moments later Dani was applying tattoos to Andrew left right and sideways. He actually insisted that that Andrew keep his eyes closed until he was done and although Andrew was the one who was initially excited about this Dani was more enthused than Andrew could remember him ever being. <br />
<br />
As Andrew stood there listening to directions, things got awkward as he lifted his shirt and things were applied to his back. It became more awkward as things were applied to his belly, but Andrew endured.<br />
<br />
Finally when Dani said he was done Andrew opened his eyes and waited, knowing Dani was dying to share his &quot;masterpiece&quot; of a back story. Andrew&#39;s curiosity finally got the best of him as Dani didnt say anything, he looked in the mirror to see the goatee he had chosen for himself earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re 27.&quot; Dani said giving a piece of his back story. <br />
<br />
Andrew looked at Dani who was clearly enjoying this... give his brain an excuse to run wild and there&#39;s no stopping it.<br />
<br />
Andrew looked at the tops of his hands and forearms, finding nothing he turned them over to find a sniper rifle tattoo on his inner wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remembering the tattoo on his belly and chest he lifted his shirt. On his belly he found a scar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Knife fight.&quot; Dani blurted out immediately.<br />
<br />
Over his heart he found the tattoo of a heart with the baby face on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your kid that you never get to see. She&#39;s five now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew raised his eyebrows in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You absolutely hate it but its better this way.&quot; Dani added with a very matter-of-fact tone, &quot;You&#39;ll understand once you figure it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling up the sleeve of his left arm where he felt the application moments ago he saw a pot leaf and a pack of cigarettes. He looked in shock at his friend slightly embarrassed to have the markings on his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of your work comes from the drug lords, you don&#39;t usually get high but you do smoke cigarettes, the stress of your job is high but you usually can&#39;t let your guard down and get drunk like most people, so you smoke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew&#39;s eyes wandered to his inner bicep and he found the cigar chomping dog, exuding alpha male masculinity.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re tough as nails, professionally trained to get out of tough situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what am I?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No guesses?&quot; Dani mocked insult. <br />
<br />
&quot;A magician? Escape artist?&quot; Andrew guessed only thinking about the &quot;getting out of tough situations&quot; part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even close...&quot; When another guess didn&#39;t come. Dani rolled his eyes and reminded Andrew about his back tattoo.<br />
<br />
Andrew lifted his shirt and took a moment to read the backwards script font. <br />
   Killer <br />
Assassin<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Andrew had no idea how Dani came up with that idea for a character. <br />
<br />
Dani immediately went into an elaborate back story of his military training stopping after a reckless lifestyle of partying got him kicked out, but not until an unexpected pregnancy. His girlfriend dumped him for loosing his job with a child on the way and he had a mental breakdown. Rather than playing by the rules he decided to put his services as a human weapon up for hire to the highest bidder and become an assassin. <br />
<br />
&quot;You hope one day to retire young and reconnect with your long lost daughter, but for now its too dangerous to try and be involved.&quot; Dani finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it my character and your character partied together in school?&quot; Andrew asked with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were on your way out as I was coming in old man, but yeah we saw each other a couple times. I got more tail than you though.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Andrew and Dani admired themselves in the mirror imagining the two crazy characters they concocted for one another. A few seconds later Andrew pushed Dani out of the bathroom and onto the couch to play video games until they were ready to go out for dinner.</p>
