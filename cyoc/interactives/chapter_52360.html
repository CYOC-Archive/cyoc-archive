<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(To the author of the previous chapters: Thanks for posting on cyoc.  <br />
You're up my alley.  Hit me up on yahoo by the same name.)<br />
<br />
Ben dazed as the orgasm washed over him.  The sheer size of his cock, <br />
and the amount he was shooting, seemed to white out his thoughts.  He <br />
dozed- and when he began to come to, he immediately felt relief.  He <br />
was shrinking.<br />
<br />
He could hear Matt's voice but he couldn't yet really respond.  &quot;I <br />
told you I just wanted to see how much you could take.  Not that this <br />
isn't great, but you're kind of a statue right now,&quot; Matt was telling <br />
him.<br />
<br />
He was able to reply with a rumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;That said, I'm making a few more changes.  I don't know how you ended <br />
up with something like this- but all's fair in love and war and lust, <br />
right?  I can't pass up an opportunity like this.  You understand, <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt made a confused grunt.  His vision was starting to come back to <br />
him, his muscles shrinking so that he could see past them, finally.  <br />
He still couldn't look side to side, so all he could see.. was a very <br />
smug and happy looking Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I've taken control.  You might think that I'd shrink you and grow <br />
me, so that you'd have no chance of taking this back.  But you'd be <br />
wrong.  See, after a certain measure, the muscle begins hindering you- <br />
I'm sure you've noticed.  So I don't need to shrink you- I just need <br />
you big enough to move, but not small enough to outmaneuver me.  <br />
Frankly, I don't think you could use the phone anymore anyway,&quot; he <br />
said.<br />
<br />
(When did the magic program get on the phone, Ben wondered?  He <br />
decided never to think about it again.)<br />
<br />
As he continued to shrink, he felt a tingling about his body- a <br />
sensation unfamiliar to him.  He couldn't quite look down at himself <br />
yet, but Matt filled in the blanks helpfully: &quot;I'm making you small <br />
enough to move around.  Just.  But I like my guys a little older- I <br />
think you'll like being, say, 45?  In good shape for your age, <br />
obviously.&quot;  Matt laughed at his own joke.<br />
<br />
Ben's upper body had shrunk enough now that he could pivot a bit, and <br />
he was able to see more of what was happening to him.  He still <br />
couldn't see very far down- his neck was too thick, and anyway his <br />
pecs were bulging too far out.  But he could see and feel that his <br />
shoulders and arms had unbound, somewhat.<br />
<br />
He could move them, at least.  With a curious, testing motion, he <br />
found that he would be able to grip and lift things- probably very <br />
heavy things- as long as they weren't directly in front of him.  He <br />
couldn't bend his arms enough to reach his face yet- but he might be <br />
able to feed himself as long as he was using a fork.<br />
<br />
These were important observations, because his shrinking was slowing.<br />
<br />
There was a part of him that wasn't shrinking, however.  &quot;What about <br />
my dick?  It's too big,&quot; Ben complained.  Somewhere deep down he <br />
thought he probably shouldn't be complaining.<br />
<br />
Matt shrugged, grinning lewdly.  &quot;Well, don't you want to be big <br />
EVERYWHERE?  It's not like you're not big enough to handle it,&quot; he <br />
pointed out.<br />
<br />
That was true.  Ben's shrinking had slowed to a crawl by now- if it <br />
weren't for the continuing sensation of compacting, he wouldn't have <br />
been able to tell he was getting smaller at all.  This appeared to be <br />
the size that Matt was after.<br />
<br />
He could walk.  That was surprisingly relieving to Ben- being totally <br />
immobile had given him a growing sense of claustrophobia.  But he <br />
could only walk- running was out of the question.  It might not even <br />
be considered walking- it was more like heaving himself forward, huge <br />
rippling motions of lunging one side, then the other, forward.<br />
<br />
At this rate he could make it to Matt in about ten minutes.  Getting <br />
out of the house (it's a house now) would take an hour, if he was <br />
lucky.  He wasn't sure he'd be able to get up if he fell.<br />
<br />
He wanted to think more about how well he could move, but the feeling <br />
of his cockhead dragging on the floor with those first few steps had <br />
distracted him badly.<br />
<br />
Matt was watching quietly- aroused and a little afraid by his own <br />
creation.  For all his bravado, he was obviously in over his head.  <br />
Ben considered trying to assert some control- but honestly, he needed <br />
Matt.  He couldn't fix this himself, in his condition.  Though he <br />
could break Matt in two, reaching him was another matter entirely- and <br />
he didn't think he had it in him to hurt him, anyway.<br />
<br />
That and, if he was being totally honest- he was really, really <br />
enjoying this.<br />
<br />
Slowly, painstakingly, he turned his body to face the full-length <br />
mirror on the wall.  He looked inhuman- a bloated mass of muscle, <br />
beyond what was reasonable, beyond what was expected.  His cock and <br />
balls were still resting on the floor, and looked.. almost hungry.   <br />
He wasn't sure what made him think that.<br />
<br />
The sheer expanse of his body actually slowed him from noticing newest <br />
change to him- he was visibly older.  His hairline was receding.  He'd <br />
sprouted a thick goatee without noticing- his face had felt thick and <br />
insulated with muscle for a while now, and the extra layer of hair <br />
hadn't really registered mentally.<br />
<br />
His goatee was evenly speckled with gray, and his heavy brow had deep <br />
creases.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really hate it,&quot; Matt was saying, &quot;I'll fix it.  I'm not, <br />
like, evil.  But... I think I can think of ways to help you enjoy <br />
this...&quot;</p>
