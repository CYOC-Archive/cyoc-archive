<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Briana&#39;s heels clacked loudly on the wooden floor of the narrow corridor that lead to the more private &quot;dance&quot; room. She almost felt dizzy from the dissonant memories in her head. On one side she had been a he barely 2 hours before now. On the other side, she had been doing this since freshman year, she knew this place like the palm of her hand, Derek knew her well enough to provide her with his guest room anytime that she would be over for a party, for a price, of course.<br />
<br />
She looked back over her neck just in time to catch Josh stumbling a bit as he reached the top of the stairs, on his face a look of pleasure and confusion that only made her anticipation stronger, did his bulge seem a little less prominent on his tight pants? Were they somehow not as aware as she was of the transformation? She knew that whatever was happening to them was what happened to her, but at the same time she just felt so, so horny, her moist folds beckoning her &#39;curiosity&#39; of watching this unfold before her own eyes.<br />
<br />
Eli was the last to enter the room, his newly sensitive nipples almost distracting him from his task: &#39;follow bree into the sex room&#39;, he repeated mentally everytime the pleasure felt a bit too good to handle, and judging from the multiple times he had to egg on his friends to go forward along the way, he would say that he was relatively very successfull on doing that. He would say that, that is, if there was enough room on his mind for anything else than what he was already doing at the moment.<br />
<br />
He bumped into Matt&#39;s wide back as he suddenly stopped in the middle of the room, his hands instinctively going for his friends waist to support him as he leaned heavily to be able to see past the towering linebacker. He gasped slightly as he saw the reason they had stopped: Bree and Josh were kissing about 5 feet ahead of him. As soon as the kiss presumably had started, however, Bree pulled out, turned to Matt and planted on him an equally passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
Eli felt his dick hardening in his pants as he stared, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder how good it must be to kiss Matt&#39;s (still considerably) manly face, to feel his beard against his- <br />
<br />
Eli&#39;s train of thought was interrupted when suddenly Bree was on him, he almost fell backwards for a second before he caught himself and reciprocated. His mouth tingled as his lips swole slightly with the stimulation, making the kiss feel even better until it suddenly ended.<br />
<br />
Josh watched mesmerized as Bree kissed their fellow teammates one by one. His dick throbbing almost painfully in his pants as he got hornier and hornier, it was all he could do to keep his hands from fondling himself. He knew that Bree would not allow that before she gave express permission. As quickly as she had begun, she broke off from Eli and strode up to a leather couch in the corner of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, boys, we have all been here before, as you -probably- remember. It might be the first time with the three of you at the same time, but you guys know the drill, nothing has changed: I love foreplay and I love slutty dancing. So show me what you&#39;ve got. Whoever dances the best will get the first fuck of the day, take off everything but your underwear and you may begin&quot; She said, taking out her panties from beneath her skirt and throwing it aside.<br />
<br />
The boys tried not to stare at each other as they undressed. Matt had to stifle a moan as his shirt slid over his sensitive nipples, and Josh failed miserably at it, letting out a half-strangled whimper that restiffened the shame dwindled erections that tented their boxers. At this point the pretense of not looking was thrown out of the window as they openly stared at each other&#39;s throbbing bulges. To his chagrin, Josh noticed that only his seemed slightly smaller than usual, especially his balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;As lovely as the competition is, the music won&#39;t dance itself, come on, ta-ta&quot; Said an impatient Briana from the couch, her hand slipping between her legs as the boys started their number.<br />
<br />
The dance started out... Awkwardly to say the best. Matt had done this so many times before but he never had competitors before. Suddenly he was very worried that she might not pick him as the best as she struggled to find the rythm of the still audible music from downstairs. It was when he noticed Eli twerking to his side that it clicked. He almost stopped dancing completely when he saw those enourmous globes of flesh as they wiggled, growing slightly with every ripple and wave when he found his rythm.<br />
<br />
Eli had never twerked before, but also twerking had never felt this good before. The secret was on movement of the legs actually, not the back, he somehow knew. But everytime his ass came down it shot a bolt of pleasure directly into his dick and nipples as he felt his hips being tugged apart ever so slightly, making his boxers tighten up against his hard bulge and generating a pleasure feedback loop of the heavens.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he felt Matt&#39;s hands grab him by the waist and jam his spandex covered  against his ass to the rythm of the song. Coating his crack in a smattering of pre as he straightened up until he felt the other man&#39;s hard nipples on his back and brought his hands back to pull at Matt&#39;s waist, their muscled arms crossed as they pulled eachother into their wanting bodies, their minds fogging up with hornyness as they &quot;danced&quot; to the rapidly increasing eletronic rythm.<br />
<br />
Matt was too into it to notice the increasing lubrication on his dick as he ground it against the runnerback&#39;s growing fleshy globes, the sensation frustratingly dulled by the underwear they were wearing. What wasn&#39;t dulled by unnecessary fabric was the feeling of his hard nipples pressing against the other man&#39;s back. When they started it had only been the tip of his needy nipples that brushed against Eli&#39;s sweaty skin, but with every thrust of his hips it seemed that more and more of his nipples were sliding over his dance partner&#39;s skin <br />
<br />
Joshua&#39;s way of fighting the inhibitions brought on by his competitors was to avoid looking at them at all costs, and doing his own thing that he knew would be good enough. He thought. He started by girating his hips and running his hands sensuously over his body. That quickly stopped when his hands found his nipples, though. He couldn&#39;t help but pull and tug at them while girating his hips. With each pull they seemed to feel even better to the touch, his calloused hands generating enough friction for it to feel overpoweringly good.<br />
<br />
He finally was able to muster up enough willpower to break one hand out of his nipple play when he felt some liquid running down his legs. Reaching his hand down his boxers, he struggled not to stimulate his never harder cock to poke at the source of his wetness. It took some time but he finally identified the mess of slick flesh and juices as his scrotum, his balls felt marble sized. In his sudden worry he pressed a bit tightly against his balls and his knees buckled as he fought back an orgasm, any preoccupation melting off of his mind as he settled on his new rythm tugging on his growing breasts with one hand and pushing into his dwindling balls with the other.<br />
<br />
Bree was lost on her second orgasm. She hadn&#39;t thought things would escalate quite so fast. She didn&#39;t even notice as Derek slid into the room quietly.</p>
