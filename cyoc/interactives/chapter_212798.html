<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then Ty said &quot;I think you&#39;ve had enough for today, get some rest&quot; and then Dustin fell asleep.<br />
<br />
When he woke up he was in his bed, he looked at his now shiny pink alarm clock next to his bed which indicated that it was 9am. Still with a little blurry look, he got up as best he could, his head felt very heavy because of the huge amount of hair he now had, and he sat on the edge of his bed, his gaze was lost for a while at his door as he stood woke up fully. After about two minutes he turned to see himself, he was still naked, his hair was all over the bed and, no matter how hard he tried to remove it, he just ended up pulling and hurting his head. After he looked at his still small penis, he could only remind himself of all the times he had bragged about his imposing size only to be depressed by seeing the almost non-existent penis he now had.<br />
<br />
Then he moved his gaze a little to his legs only to get nasty surprised. &quot;What the fuck??!&quot; Apart from remembering Ty&#39;s modification to his voice, he could see that unlike how he usually sat, with his legs spread wide and in a distinctly masculine way, Dustin discovered that he was sitting cross-legged and positioned very feminine. He immediately moved them to sit as he usually would, but as soon as he did so an unexplained force pushed them back into a feminine pose, after several tries he found it useless to try and decided to stand up. Dustin went to his closet to look for some clothes, to his surprise his walk had also been altered, now he couldn&#39;t help but move a lot his hips with each step he took, he walked around his room trying to stop but, again , it was useless. After several investigations he realized that, no matter how hard he tried, all of his demeanor had turned completely feminine, and there was no way he could change it. He approached his mirror in despair while doing his tests, he also discovered that it was maddening to see himself in the reflection, since his <i>almost</i> normal body now had all those incredibly effeminate movements, his hair long and combed elegantly, the tiara perfectly arranged and the heavy makeup intact on her face.<br />
<br />
Dustin thought that if he couldn&#39;t figure out how his body moved, he could at least try to change his appearance. The first thing Dustin tried was to remove his makeup, it was what bothered him the most and he wanted to stop seeing him wearing it. He noticed that on his desk were just over 20 bottles of water, placed almost purposely to the side of the mirror, Dustin took them and almost threw them in his face while he scrubbed off his makeup. One bottle, two bottles, three... He ended up completely drenched with the water from all the bottles and he couldn&#39;t make a single change to his makeup. &quot;Why doesn&#39;t this shit come out??&quot; he rubbed himself so hard that his face started to hurt and nothing, it almost seemed like it was part of his face, he even tried to rip off the apparently false eyelashes only to discover that they were his real eyelashes, he was stuck with a permanent makeup.<br />
<br />
Seeing that his attempts were useless again, he forcefully grabbed the tiara and threw it towards the wall with all his might, at least he could change that, right? Dustin was lamenting that his throwing was completely screwed up and feminized when he could feel an extra weight on his head again &quot;What&#39;s happening now?!&quot; He turned back to his mirror to discover that another tiara, a slightly larger one and now with a few small stones in it, had appeared on top of his head. Dustin did the same thing with that tiara as with the previous one, only to discover that the same thing happened. Dustin tried so many times that now the floor of his room was full of tiaras, but another one always appeared bigger and heavier than the previous one, by the time Dustin gave up he was wearing a huge and heavy crown with many shiny stones decorating it.<br />
<br />
In a last ditch attempt to change anything, Dustin searched through all his drawers until he found a pair of large scissors, aggressively took a very large lock of his hair and cut it as short as possible, only to watch in horror as it immediately grew out at the same length as before. By this point Dustin knew it was useless to keep trying.<br />
<br />
Defeated, all Dustin wanted was some clothes, he turned to his closet and reluctantly opened it. With everything he&#39;d seen so far, Dustin expected to see a closet full of girlish and extra girly clothes, but he was finally pleasantly surprised when he discovered that, in the closet, it was his clothes, clothes that regular Dustin wore, it was a little smaller from the shoulders and his underwear wasn&#39;t as big now, but it was definitely his clothes. Excited, he quickly grabbed some underwear, a shirt and pants, he could finally escape a bit of forced femininity. He had to struggle a bit with his hair and be careful not to let the crown fall off (so a bigger one wouldn&#39;t come out) to finish dressing but he finally made it. Dustin went back to the mirror, despite being a little smaller, her clothes were still looser than usual and Dustin knew it was because Ty hadn&#39;t returned all of his muscles, but for now this was enough. Dustin was looking in the mirror and comparing how he looked now to how he looked before, taking some comfort in the fact that it wasn&#39;t as vast a difference as everything else about him, when he realized something was wrong, the Dustin&#39;s clothes gradually began to change color, texture and shape, by the time Dustin realized, his shirt had turned into a corset like the one from last night, this time in deep red. Dustin began to tremble as, both his pants and his shirt, came together in one piece and turned into a dress just as fluffy as the one Ty made her wear earlier. As he could, took it off and tried to find other of his clothes only to discover that, as soon as he put it on, the fabrics turned into fluffy dresses of different colors.<br />
<br />
All of Dustin&#39;s will collapsed when he looked in the mirror and the one who looked back at him seemed to be a young femboi in his sweet sixteens. He preferred to just give up on everything and went back to his bed to sleep.<br />
<br />
But then...</p>
