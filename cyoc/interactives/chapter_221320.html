<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>There really was a set of quints (different name) in Canada that were put on display by the government. Go figure.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On May 05, 1934 in Alberta Canada, Oliver and Emma Divinus gave birth to a set of five identical girls. The Quintuplets were the first known to have survived beyond infancy, all reaching adulthood. As of this writing, two remain alive.<br />
<br />
The girls, upon their birth, were immediately met with celebrity and fame because of their unprecedented existence. Within days of leaving the hospital, their parents were persuaded to surrender them to be put on display in public exhibitions across the United States. The popularity of these &#39;incubator-baby&#39; exhibitions soon caught the attention of the government, who stepped in and passed the &quot;Divinus Quintuplets&#39; Guardianship Act of 1935&quot; which made them Wards of the Crown until the age of 18. The Alberta provincial government, and many savvy local businesses, began to profit greatly by turning the sisters into a significant tourist attraction.<br />
<br />
Naturally, fame and notoriety brought untold value to the sister&#39;s few personal effects. Their used blankets and clothing, among other items, were sold to the public as souvenirs and mementos. One such collection of items, which was valued above all others, was the unique set of vinyl medical wristbands that had been used to identify them at birth.<br />
<br />
This collection of wristbands is cataloged herein as Entity #55555 : The Quintus Medical Wristbands.<br />
<br />
These five wristbands were purchased by Edwin Gimmerson in 1938. The Gimmerson collection boasted many supernatural curios including the following cataloged entities : #489, #753,  &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;, and #1264.<br />
<br />
The entire collection remains secured pending further investigation.<br />
<br />
Edwin&#39;s personal interest in the wristbands at the time is unknown, however, by 1940 his wife had seemingly given birth to a new set of quintuplet boys in Rochester Minnesota. No physical record can be found of these boys until May 05 1947 (photo attached) when the boys were seemingly revealed to the wider public for the first time.<br />
<br />
Following the sudden appearance of the Gimmerson Quints, a second set of quints was astonishingly recorded within their immediate peer group, when a year later, Mark and Beth Davis, also of Rochester, were found to have been raising a set of undocumented quintuplet girls of roughly 8 years old.<br />
<br />
The wristbands were also found in close geographical proximity to a similar 1950 event wherein five undocumented, identical brothers from Milwaukee Wisconsin enlisted in the US army together.  No official record of the brothers existed prior to 1950, but all interviewed parties insist the boys had always been patriotic Americans. Sworn affidavits from doctors, nurses, teachers, clergy, friends, and family were sufficient to firmly establish the boys&#39; otherwise unrecorded lives. Though the lack of extant documentation was highly improbable, it was assumed to be due to an unprecedented bout of clerical errors. The boys fought in the Korean War and were decorated as war heroes.<br />
<br />
The wristbands comprising Entity #55555 are printed with the following text :<br />
<br />
&quot;Patient Number [X] : Doctor Jake Friendly, MD. - D.O.B 05/05/[YYYY]&quot;<br />
<br />
Where &#39;X&#39; is given in place of birth order number (1 to 5), and &#39;YYYY&#39; is given in place of the current calendar year (value updates yearly, method unknown).<br />
<br />
No names appear on the wristbands besides that of the attending physician, Jake Friendly, who had been present to deliver the Divinus quints, and who was primarily the one to persuade the parents that it was medically in the girls&#39; best interest that they be surrendered for a life of public exhibition.<br />
<br />
****************<br />
No special precautions are required to contain Entity #55555, except on May 05 of each year when it becomes active. Though the Entity is impossible to physically contain when active, undesirable effects may be avoided through the use of proper conduct and handling as outlined below.<br />
<br />
Proper Conduct and Handling:<br />
On May 05th it is required to observe the following within 300m of Entity #55555.<br />
<br />
	1. Avoid the entire active area when possible.<br />
	2. Keep hands and feet in view at all times. Any covering of the wrist or ankles invites Entity #55555 to attach itself. Keep hands out of pockets and do not reach into dark spaces.<br />
	3. Wrists and arms are to remain uncovered. Short pants, or skirts are to be worn without shoes or socks. Short sleeve shirts or less are mandatory at all times. No watches or jewelry permitted.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Four full trials have been conducted to assess the nature of Entity #55555. All trials ended in the formation of a new set of quintuplets. If Entity #55555 comes into contact with a person&#39;s wrist or ankle on May 05, it will immediately wrap itself around the contacted limb and engage its clasp. Once clasped, the wristband cannot be removed by any means.<br />
<br />
Once banded, the affected person appears to hallucinate an announcement, as if from a hospital intercom, instructing them that they have 10 minutes to select another person to be banded. Only living people who personally know the banded person may be selected (no celebrity strangers). <br />
<br />
Once the selection is made, the selected person instantly appears within five feet of the first banded person, and one of the other wristbands inevitably finds its way onto the newcomer&#39;s limb. If no selection is made within the allotted 10 minutes, a random person will appear and become banded regardless. This random individual seemingly does not adhere to the restriction that demands a level of familiarity between selector and selectee. <br />
<br />
It should be noted here that banded participants are physically forced to stay in close proximity to the rest of the group until the entire process is complete. Measurements indicate that no wristband can move more than 5 feet away from any other wristband at any time during the process. This often becomes a source of anxiety and frustration for the participants.<br />
<br />
The newly banded participant is subsequently given their own hallucinatory instructions and 10 minutes to select another person to join the set, and so on until five total people have been banded. <br />
<br />
At this point in the trials, a medical folder appears among the banded participants containing a detailed background and history for each individual. The banded participants are then allowed a further 10 minutes to review the material, which also contains the following hand-scrawled doctor&#39;s note.<br />
<br />
—----------------------------<br />
*The enclosed is a comprehensive life history for each patient. Please review them for fitness and select the best candidate. The remaining candidates will unfortunately cease to be as they are, but they will find rebirth as identical quints. If you are unable or unwilling to make the selection yourselves, I will be happy to make the selection at random in five hours.<br />
<br />
	- Jake Friendly, MD.<br />
<br />
P.S. - Hourly periods of rejuvenation from oldest to youngest will begin shortly. The sooner you come to an agreement, the sooner the rejuvenation will cease.<br />
—----------------------------<br />
<br />
At the end of the 10 minute material-review period, the oldest person from the group starts to get steadily younger over the course of the next hour, until they are the same age as the second oldest. Then the two oldest grow younger over the next hour until they are the same age as the 3rd oldest. Then the three oldest regress in age until they are the same age as the 4th oldest, and so on until all banded participants are of equal age. In the fifth hour, all participants regress steadily back to infancy, and in the five minutes following that, they are morphed from their original infant bodies to become an identical set of quints.<br />
<br />
Full duration of change [Five Hours, Fifty-Five Minutes].<br />
<br />
The only way to stop the group from becoming infant copies of one of the participants at random, is for the group to come to a UNANIMOUS decision of who will serve as the genetic template for the others. Once that decision is made, the rest of the participants immediately begin to transform into identical copies of the chosen individual at whatever age they happened to be at that time. The rate of this change varies by how quickly the group came to a decision. The total time for the entire process is always the same, so early agreement results in a slow transformation, which cannot be stopped once the agreement is reached.<br />
<br />
Every other alternative action that does not involve a unanimous vote, results in 100% group infancy in addition to the always inevitable 80% drop in group individuality.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that there is a formidable reality changing effect that accompanies the mentioned physical changes. Living arrangements and personal possessions seem to manifest magically to accommodate the new siblings in accordance with their new host family&#39;s socio-economic station. Each quint is even given an appropriate name that is compatible with their new form, though no official documentation or record of the new identity ever materializes. This is a novel hallmark of Entity #55555, and is a key method in identifying new cases of &#39;Divinus Quints&#39;.<br />
<br />
Post effect care for quintized individuals should include counseling and monitoring when age-appropriate. Affected individuals undergo pronounced mental/personality changes that seem to bring them in line with their new bodies, however, these changes can be slow to embed themselves, and distressing to experience in the interim… Furthermore, relatives and acquaintances seem to be affected as well, becoming hosts to implanted memories that ultimately make the changes in reality almost impossible to detect, even most lesser Government Agencies are quick to attribute any lack of documentation for these siblings to known system deficiencies in handling large numbers of coincident siblings. Integration of the new siblings into society has always been gradual, but inevitable.<br />
<br />
When operating around Entity #55555, just remember this simple mnemonic:<br />
<br />
If the date is 5/5, keep an eye on your wrists and ankles, or you&#39;ll be one of five, in five hours fifty-five minutes!</p>
