<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry had found the toilet and purged her bladder, then went to the safe and using Alicia birthdate, opened it in order to retrieve what was left of the Sugar doll. She was surprised to find 3 satchels remaining not two. The two yellow arms of the doll were clear enough, joined together by a thread. Another satchel Henry recognised was the brown satchel that they suspected would cause a swap of hair. What Henry didn’t recognise was a white square shaped lump. She could not remember seeing it before. It was definately a satchel but appeared different to all the other parts of the doll.<br />
<br />
Henry picked up the cube and examined it. It felt heavier than the other satchels and the lumps of presumably crystal inside were much larger than the sand like magical crystals that had been inside every other satchel. The crystals in this satchel seemed more like fine gravel and the material surrounding them seemed more like plastic, a stark comparison to the very fine netting that made up the other satchels.<br />
<br />
Henry didn&#39;t know what to make of it. She briefly considered tossing it in the rubbish but something in the back of her mind told her not to - it was lying with the remaining satchels. Then inspiration hit her - it was no doubt some of those dehumidifying crytals, such as you might find in a jar of tablets. They had possibly even come with the doll, perhaps to prevent the satchels degrading pre-maturely? Now that would have been a disaster - imagine if the satchels disintegrated before they could all be consumed. Henry would be stuck in her current hybrid male/female body. Henry found it scary to imagine possessing a vagina for the rest of her life. One day had been long enough.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with this latest theorey about what this white satchel was, Henry left it in the safe. She took the other two satchels to the kitchonette wanting to show Alicia their choices. She recalled Alicia suggesting they do an arm swap tomorrow, that was probably sensible, Henry would still have Alicia’s face, and tummy for another 24 hours. She would remain short and have these breasts until the doll was consumed. The alternative was to swap hair. However having long blonde hair once Henry got his own face back in another 24 hours, was probably better than having female arms. Not that either were the end of the world. Both options were preferrable to having Alicia&#39;s genitals.<br />
<br />
Alicia was taking longer to arrive at the suite than Henry expected, she anxiously glanced at the clock. It was only 11.24 so they still had plenty of time. Henry was not planning to miss taking a satchel tonight. She didn’t want to wake up still a woman tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Alex had insisted on walking Alicia to the doorway of the resort. There Alex had initiated another kiss and Alicia had not resisted terribly hard. The man was a good kisser and it was nice to feel a big muscular chest holding her body in a tight embrace. It was quite a contrast to Henry’s current hugs where she had the phenomenon of two sets of breasts pushing into each other. Where Henry was soft and cuddly, Alex was hard and masculine. It was only when Alex’s hand once more began to wander too close to Alicia’s hidden penis that she had to push him away and tell him good night once more. Thankfully Alex did not persist and had finally departed.<br />
<br />
Alicia composed herself before entering the suite. She found Henry in the kitchenette.<br />
<br />
‘We need to take a satchel’ Henry unnecessarily informed Alicia.<br />
<br />
‘Just let me get this panty shaper off and be free again. It has become very uncomfortable’ In front of Henry, Alicia hitched up her dress and pulled down her underwear releasing the penis. Kissing Alex had caused Mister Marvellous to become excited. It immediately sprang to attention and caused her dress to sport a prominent lump where a lump should not be.<br />
<br />
Henry watched with interest. Dancing with Richard had made her aroused. That arousal had tempered somewhat on the drive back to the resort but the knowledge of what was causing the lump in Alicia’s dress was getting Henry wet again. She well recalled how pleasurable the female orgasm she had experienced that morning had been.<br />
<br />
Henry composed herself ‘That can wait until we drink a satchel. Talking of which I got what remained of the doll from the safe. There are three satchels left. I thought we only had hair and arms to go but there seems to be a round white satchel, I could not recall’<br />
<br />
‘Yeah I saw that after I removed the face. It was inside the head’<br />
<br />
’I think its most likely just some de-humidifying crystals and not really part of the doll but I left it in the safe just in case. These are our options for tomorrow. Arms or hair? I&#39;m thinking arms. I will still have your face and will need to be Rachel for one more day&#39;<br />
<br />
‘I had arms in mind. I already have our outfits sorted out’ Alicia got excited thinking about presenting Rachel/Henry with the dress she had caught her admiring in the shop. The dress was sleeveless so could only be worn by Rachel if she had female arms. She also had a longsleeved outfit in mind for herself for the day when she would have Henrys, larger arms.<br />
<br />
So Henry dissolved the yellow arms sachet in a glass of water while Alicia returned the brown sachet to the safe. By the time Alicia had returned the sachet had totally dissolved. Henry darnk half of the glass and passed the remainder to Alicia. She downed the liquid without hesitation. Much as she had enjoyed fucking her husband with her botrrowed penis earlier that day, she wanted to get her vagina back. It had been quite uncomfortable to hiding the a penis all day.<br />
<br />
Henry glanced at the clock, 11.38, plenty of time. She would be male again come the morning. Henry then glanced at Alicia and reached across to feel the lump causing her dress to tent out. She wanted to experience another female orgasm while she still could. <br />
Alicia let herself be led into the bedroom only too happy to oblige</p>
