<br />
I scrolled through the long list of transformation themed hypnosis files, each displayed with a brief description of the effects and triggers.  How many of these had Gloria listened to already, and how many did she just pick up off the internet out of curiosity?  Did she really want to know what it was like to become ALL of these?  Wait, she even had a “cat transformation hypnosis” file?  But she WAS a cat!<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe she hadn’t been this morning, before that fairy’s blessing or curse or whatever I really should call it got to her.<br />
<br />
Well, in any case, she said she’d gotten into hypnosis in the first place because her mind was so “noisy,” so I guessed she’d probably prefer becoming something that didn’t have to think too hard about anything.<br />
<br />
Bimbo?  Could be fun, but not as fun to play with if it wasn’t really a physical change.<br />
<br />
Drone or Robot?  Having her take whatever order I gave while triggered was appealing, but the files themselves seemed a little too long to leave any time to have any fun with the triggers before our free period was over.<br />
<br />
Furniture?  I guess this’d make her want to be sat on, or used as a leg rest, or something.  Kinda funny mental image, but I’ll pass for now.<br />
<br />
Sex doll?  This morning was literally our first time talking to each other!  I’m not gonna just jump straight to making her lie there and let me bang her without any resistance, especially after she said she trusted me.  Even if I was the type, I wouldn’t want to risk the chance of someone walking in on us here!<br />
<br />
Statue?  Hm, yeah, that might work, I could-<br />
<br />
Oh, a plushie transformation file?  That’s a transformation I always found cute.  And according to the description, it had separate triggers for a couple fun effects, too.  <br />
<br />
I pushed play, and watched as Gloria’s breathing slowed down, and her body relaxed.<br />
<br />
<B>Gloria<br />
~~~</B><br />
<br />
“Relax,” the female voice on the cording whispered.  “Just lie back, close your eyes, and relax.  Let every part of your body become loose and limp, heavy and comfortable.”<br />
<br />
I breathed deeply, just focusing on the soothing voice, following its instructions.  I knew trying to not think of anything else wouldn’t clear my mind any faster, so I just kept focusing on the voice, knowing the more attention I gave it, the less I’d focus on my worries about getting my homework done, or whether Greg was more interested in Constance than me.  And it was working.  <br />
<br />
I breathed in, taking in positive, relaxing thoughts, and then breathed out, letting my worries go out with them.<br />
<br />
“Drop deeper and deeper.  The deeper you go, the better you feel, the better you feel, the deeper you go.”<br />
<br />
The deeper I went, the better I felt…  A pleasant fog took over more of my mind…  One of the few clear thoughts I had left-<br />
<br />
“Just feel warm and comfortable, safe and secure, as you become blank, empty, mindless.  Nothing left but warm bliss, and my words.”<br />
<br />
Warm bliss… her words…  My last… clear thought… was being… so happy… Greg would… do this… for me…  I hoped… one day… he’d entrance me… himse-<br />
<br />
“And Sleep!”<br />
<br />
<i>Snap</i><br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
“Three…” the female voice counted up as I began to consciously perceive things again.  “Slowly becoming aware of your surroundings.”<br />
<br />
“Four… stretch your limbs as energy returns.”  I stretched my arms, legs and tail, feeling a little more clear headed.<br />
<br />
“Five!  Out of trance, awake, alert, and refreshed!”  I opened my eyes and looked up at Greg, who was smiling down at me.<br />
<br />
“You look pretty cute when you’re sleeping,” he said.<br />
<br />
I blinked, then realized this meant the “forgetful” induction I’d set to play in front of my file had worked!  For the first time ever, it really worked!  I’d forgotten going into trance!  <br />
<br />
Which was especially exciting when I was letting someone else pick which file I’d listen to!  When he triggered me next, would I end up being a cheery, obedient maid?  A logical robot?  A helpless, horny sexdoll?  Would I feel myself growing wings and scales? Or standing still as a calm, beautiful statue?  Or maybe growing cat ears and a tail… wait, why did I have that file?  I was already a cat.<br />
<br />
I sat up, my heart racing as I waited with baited breath to hear a trigger.  “Thanks for that.  Your lap makes for a pretty nice pillow.”<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome,” he said, smiling.  “So, uh… I guess you’d like me to trigger you now?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!  Uh… please?”  I stood up, listening eagerly.<br />
<br />
“Okay… er… well, come here, ‘my big ragdoll plushie.’”<br />
<br />
<i>~!</I><br />
<br />
Instantly I feel… the effects… he he… feel so light.  Like my head’s full of cotton!  Ha!  Oh, and the rest of me too!  Lots of soft, warm cotton!  Cotton can’t stand up though… Woah! I fall down on Owner’s lap.  Doesn’t hurt though, don’t worry!  A soft toy like me lands soft.  It’s kinda fun, actually! <br />
<br />
Mmm, Owner’s lap is so warm.  He looks kinda scared though!  Oh, I hope I didn’t spook him.  If a toy like me could move, I’d hug him, help him feel better!  Owner, if you hug me, you’ll feel better, I know it!<br />
<br />
<B>Greg<br />
~~~</B><br />
<br />
I could get used to having a girl sleeping on my lap.  Watching her slowly slip into trance was kind of enjoyable, too.  If Gloria’s gonna be my girlfriend thanks to the fairy’s blessing, well, this was definitely something I’d look forward to doing again.<br />
<br />
Maybe I was discovering I’d also got a hypnosis fetish on top of being into furries.<br />
<br />
I put that thought aside as when she woke up.  “You look pretty cute when you’re sleeping.”<br />
<br />
She blinked a couple times, then sat up, smiling wide.  “Thanks for that.  Your lap makes for a pretty nice pillow.”<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome.”  I still felt a little hesitant about this, even if she’d asked me to do it.  “So, uh… I guess you’d like me to trigger you now?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!”  She practically leapt up.  “Uh… Please?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Okay… er… well, come here, ‘my big ragdoll plushie.’”<br />
<br />
That was when the third weirdest thing I’d see today happened.  In seconds, Gloria’s fur changed texture subtly, looking more like cloth than real fur.  Her jaws joined together into a plush lump of a snout, and her ears smoothed over, the skin inside them, and on her nose turning into more cloth.  Her eyes hardened into green plastic half-spheres.  It seemed like every bone in her body must’ve been turned into cotton, because she tumbled right back into my lap before I had time to react.<br />
<br />
I gasped and froze.  This wasn’t supposed to happen!  She was just supposed to act like she was a doll now, not actually become one!<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, I reached down and touched her head.  “Gloria?  Are you in there?  Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Panicking, I thought of the other triggers.  There were different ways to combine them for different effects, and a full revert trigger, but in my haste, I just blurted out the first different trigger combo that came to mind, rather than the reversal.<br />
<br />
“My little living plushie!”<br />
<br />
I heard a giggle in Gloria’s voice, coming from the doll, as it shrank down into its clothes.  I watched as the toy I’d turned Gloria into shrank into a foot-tall lump somewhere in her clothes, that, after a few moments, shuffled around and moved on its own.<br />
<br />
The plush poked its head out from the bottom half of her shirt.  “Hi Owner!”  she cheered.  I was almost just as shocked to see that part work.  She climbed out, her body a little rounder, and her limbs much shorter, even compared to how the rest of her body had shrunk, with no sign of fingers or toes, while her head seemed a little larger than would fit on a body like that.<br />
<br />
“Sorry I spooked you when I fell.”  She jumped over, and wrapped her stubby arms around her waist as best as she could.  “You could use a hug, right?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, right.”  I wrapped my arms around her, and squeezed her little plush body to mine.  To my surprise, she started purring.  I felt oddly relaxed as I just sat there for a few minutes, hugging a stuffed toy that had been a cat girl minutes ago, and a human I’d never spoken to before, hours before that.  <br />
<br />
So, yeah, I hadn’t been expecting it, but I guess I had a bit of a hypno fetish too, and made the file’s effects happen literally.  This file worked by saying one combination of the phrase “my little/big living/ragdoll plush.”  If you said “little” they’d become the size of a typical toy, while if you said “big” they’d stay the same.  The “living” and “ragdoll” effects were also pretty self-explanatory.  This was… a lot to take in.  And… boy did this open up some tempting possibilities.<br />
<br />
I tried not to let my thoughts go too far in that direction, though, and just took a few more moments to enjoy hugging Gloria.<br />
<br />
As the end of the free period got closer, I let go, and said, “revert to normal.”<br />
<br />
I felt the weight in my lap increasing as she steadily grew back to full size, the cloth turning back into fur, her eyes becoming soft and real again, her mouth, nose, and ears opening up once more, and…<br />
<br />
I blushed, seeing her bare, furry bust resting on my lap as she stretched.<br />
<br />
“Oh, man!  That was so calming.”  She said with a sigh.  “Thank you again.  I-”  She looked down at herself.  “Eep!  Qu-quick!  Stand over there and be my lookout!”  She hastily got up and grabbed her clothes.  “People don’t come here often, but if someone DOES peek, and tells on me, I’d get in huge trouble for breaking the dress code!”<br />
<br />
I was kinda surprised she wasn’t more concerned about ME seeing her naked, but I wasn’t gonna complain, either.  I stood guard as she got dressed, feeling a little disappointed knowing we’d have to part for next period.</p>
