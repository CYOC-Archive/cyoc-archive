<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was still fairly dark out when the William&#39;s alarm went off. Despite Martha&#39;s trouble in the night, likely coming from the concerns and worries that both of them had with Eric. They were happy and proud that Julie Stovall had gotten him out of his proverbial shell, and a good part of William looked forward to welcoming Julie into the Anderson family as a daughter-in-law, but both he and Martha had some nervous thoughts that things for them were going a bit too fast or a bit too soon. The fact that the bonds that the two of them had forged so far were so strong that neither would be able to fight the need for long had only left them with worry. The things that he and Martha could do to keep things &quot;calm&quot; until he and Martha were ready for Eric to take that next step weren&#39;t likely to be good in the long term. As he sat up and stretched he could only hope that when the time came, it was a romantic moment and that both Eric and Julie were fully conscious of what they were doing. He also hoped that Eric had learned enough from the consequences of William&#39;s past mistakes not simply rush into anything, regardless of whether or not &quot;love&quot; was the reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, dear,&quot; William said softly to Martha as she stretched. She looked fairly well rested despite her dream of Eric and Julie growing up in fast forward during the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Martha said back, &quot;and a new day begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William nodded. As he climbed out of bed, he remembered some of what he had Martha had discussed before going to bed, related to the Skulk ceremony that was scheduled for that night. He was privately sure that Eric and Nate could come, but he didn&#39;t know if the Skulk would allow for Julie or Alex, and given that Eric planned to spend the day with Julie and Nate and Alex had plans for the weekend, he figured that if his son&#39;s could bring their respective &quot;dates&quot; the ceremony might not be too much of an interruption for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to need to shower,&quot; Martha said from behind him, &quot;I smell like last night&#39;s orgy...&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded while he moved to get to his own cellphone. Once he found it, he glanced to Martha who had walked around the foot of the bed, &quot;Why don&#39;t you go first, dear. I have a few things to take care of first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought we&#39;d go together,&quot; Martha commented with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we do that... we&#39;ll end up having sex in the shower,&quot; William answered, trying to ignore the fact that his wife&#39;s present nudity was getting some stirrings between his legs, &quot;and we both have work this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remembering the in-service day, which the Moon Lake School District required substitutes to go to, Martha nodded. It made some sense. It was fairly early, and dawn was only just arriving on the eastern horizon, but it wouldn&#39;t be too long before they would have to head out. While she went into the bathroom, William checked with his phone and then with some of the cards that he and Martha had gotten earlier in the week. He heard the water in the shower come on and the exhaust fan being flipped on as he began to dial a number. The phone rang for about a minute before it went to voicemail. William sighed as it did so, as it meant he wouldn&#39;t get an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms. Tachibana, I&#39;m sorry to both you so early in the morning,&quot; William spoke as he was instructed to leave a message, &quot;this is William Anderson, and I have a question concerning tonight&#39;s ceremony. Martha and I are already bringing our sons, as our guests, and since they are our children, I&#39;m sure their attendance is allowed... however, they&#39;ve both found friendship and true love since moving to Moon Lake... and they&#39;ve had their own schedules that the ceremony will interrupt. As such... I was wondering if they might be allowed to bring a date with them? Please let me know if they can or cannot at your earliest convenience.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Blue eyes fluttered open as Eric&#39;s alarm went off. It wasn&#39;t as early as it would be on a school day, but since he planned to spend the day with Julie and Julie&#39;s mom had offered to give him a ride to the Skulk induction ceremony for his parents, he did have to get up early. He could hear some sounds from his parents bathroom and from the kitchen. That let him know that his parents were up and were getting ready for work.  However, the only thing that really came to his mind was Julie. She was beautiful and had done so much for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today will be a great day,&quot; Eric commented to himself as he put on a clean pair of underwear and dressed himself in a pair of jeans and a good shirt. He was a bit nervous in case Julie wanted to take their relationship to the next level, especially based on some of the things she&#39;d said when he&#39;d walked her home and the fact that she was only in a bathrobe while they Skyped later that night, and seemed to be taking it off while they talked. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t feel opposed to the idea, as Eric had felt plenty of stirrings within him. He loved her, he needed her, but he wanted the moment to be right. He didn&#39;t want to just rush into anything, but if the right moment came, he found himself more than willing. She was that beautiful and that kind to him, which made him quite willing to go along with the need he felt growing within him.<br />
<br />
Eric calmly whistled as he went back and forth between his dresser and closet to place a few items in a small duffel bag. This included a pair of dress shoes as well as some more formal clothing for the Skulk ceremony. From what he&#39;d heard, studied, and seen, was that werefoxes could be extremely formal in many of their group&#39;s actions, which required the need for his Sunday best. He also packed a pair of swim trunks, and made a mental note to get a beach towel before he left. Once the bag was packed, left his room.<br />
<br />
He found his mother scrambling eggs as he came downstairs and set his bag down in the dinning room. She was dressed well in a button down shirt and a pair of woman&#39;s khaki colored pants. The clothing was something she&#39;d had as a teacher in Minnesota, and while they were stretched over her enhanced curves as a werecat, they did fit her. She turned to him as he entered the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, dear,&quot; Martha said softly, &quot;Did you have a good night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Eric answered, the blue in his eyes almost glowing as he thought of his dream with Julie. His hand drifted to one of his pockets where the necklace that Martha had made for him to give to Julie was.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you and Julie plan to do for today?&quot; Martha asked, hoping that Eric didn&#39;t answer to become a weremer. She felt that the moment should evolve naturally and not rushed into.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d probably play some video games, watch TV, or go swimming,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;Just to be together and have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds fun,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;hopefully things go well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they will,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;Things just feel so right when I&#39;m with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha gave a smile to that, and did her best to keep proud tears from going down her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like some eggs? Your father and I will need to head out fairly soon, but I can add some eggs easily,&quot; Martha said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;I can settle for some serial, and Julie and I will probably have lunch together at her house... or maybe we&#39;ll go down to the diner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Martha said slowly.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s morning began shortly after dawn as he and Alex were cuddled together in their wolf forms in the woods not too far from their respective homes. Their night had been good, and had even included a chance meeting with Tad late in the night, though by that time, both pairs seemed to be on the way toward going home or at least headed in that direction after the pack&#39;s meeting and then orgy. Now, as they awakened  they had their preparations for the weekend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, handsome,&quot; Nate said to Alex as they climbed back onto their feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too, stud,&quot; Alex returned the greeting as the two began to return to their human forms in order to be in accordance with Moon Lake&#39;s laws in relation to when a were could be in their were forms, &quot;ready for a good weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate slowly nodded as his claws retracted and rounded back into human fingernails and his fur began draw back into his skin as he looked back to Alex.  His enhanced muscle of his his wolven form shrank back and as his tail  retracted back into his spine. His ears rounded and slid back onto the sides of his head. His golden werewolf eyes returned to the brown human colored eyes and as his muzzle slid back to a human mouth complete with the lack of fangs and sharp teeth. It left him in his human form again, though some of the elements that gave some vague signs of the wolf within him with with a still well muscled body  with some chest hair being there. Nate even noticed that he had even more chest hair now than he had initially after becoming a werewolf. Part of him continued to marvel at how much his body was changing just as his mother&#39;s body had changed as a werecat and as his father&#39;s body had changed as a werefox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate then spoke as he turned to the duffel bag that he had carried with him, &quot;And I am looking forward to fun and our relations growing... though some things will have to wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of your parents&#39; welcome to the Skulk?&quot; Alex wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll need to go with my parents tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, &quot;that&#39;ll be okay. I can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll ask if you&#39;ll be allowed to come along,&quot; Nate commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be fun, but...&quot; Alex began, &quot;but do you really think I&#39;d be allowed to come as a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t know, but I would, even though I&#39;m a werewolf now, my mom would, as a werecat, and my bother would be allowed as a normal,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;so I don&#39;t see a reason why you cant... so long as you you dress formally...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex slowly nodded as the two of them dressed to return to their respective homes. That made some sense, since so many weres did tend to be rather welcoming and tolerant of each other. They might have specific rules, but they would relate to certain formalities, but they would have enough things that would be ready, they broke apart from a moment. Nate made his way toward their respective homes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you in a bit,&quot; Nate called to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; Alex answered.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
William came downstairs quietly as after he finished dressing. He could smell the scent of eggs and toast, and they smelled wonderful. In fact, Martha was even placing them at one his and Martha&#39;s places at the table as he entered the dinging table. Eric was presently quietly eating from a bowl of cereal as he William came down. He smiled to his youngest son, and gave a brief check to his youngest son, though he found that Eric&#39;s eyes had changed back to a brown color, though he could he couldn&#39;t know if they had been changing to a blue color at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something smells good,&quot; William commented as he gave his wife a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha smiled back to him, &quot;Breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
William smiled to her and quietly sat down at his place at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get in touch with Akane?&quot; Martha asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;She hasn&#39;t called back, yet,&quot; William spoke, &quot;Though she could be busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Busy with what?&quot; cam a new voice as William heard the back door open and a new set of footsteps enter the house.<br />
<br />
He and Martha turned to see Nate enter the kitchen. He briefly took to them in the dining room and then turned to a cabinet before pulling out some pop tarts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably her own work,&quot; William said to Nate, &quot;which could be big.... as the Skulk&#39;s welcome for Martha and I might be big on its own. But they may allow you and Eric to invite Alex and Julie, but I don&#39;t know for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric paused as he at his cereal, while his eyes turned blue and looked to his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could bring Julie?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
William looked back to see his son sporting a par of very blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly,&quot; William told him, &quot;but I don&#39;t know for sure yet. If she says yes, I&#39;ll be be sure to let you know... You too, Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded and pushed the down button the the toaster to cook his pop tarts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;I&#39;ll need to let Alex know... but thanks for the update, dad.&quot;</p>
