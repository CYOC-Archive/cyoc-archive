<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Eight...nine...ten...eleven...twelve...fuck!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Today was the same as any other for the all-star of Charles York / Orville Cass College - the academic athlete Brady Walker. Leaping up to his feet after a heavy bench press set, Brady took a long and admiring look at himself. He still reeked with the smell of sex after receiving long, marathon sex from the local hottie he had his eye on this week - Laurie Lambert. He never settled for anything less than an 8 by his own designation - anyone else was just a hole to use for his pleasure once, and then dump.<br />
<br />
Ahh fuck, Brady thought to himself as he examined his well built musculature - he usually wore a tank top and shorts to the gym, all the better for checking out his tree trunk legs, well honed pectoral muscles heaving through the fabric, and massive arms. He threw his arms up in a flex, loving the 20 inch peaks.<br />
<br />
Brady decided to do another compound movement before moving on to his next chest exercise, moving over to the squat racks and loading up the 45 lbs bar with 3 45 lbs plates on either side. He did some light stretching and then got to work. He always loved the sheer burning sensation from his legs when he hit a squat like this. Up - down - up - down, always bringing his ass down parallel to the ground, as if he was sitting in a chair.<br />
<br />
He hit 15 reps and then racked the weight, thinking about something.<br />
<br />
He grabbed up his gym bag by his side and pulled out a bottle of pills. He scowled at them, remembering what his buddy, Linebacker Ted Stevenson said about these things. Supposedly they had awesome effects, and he was supposed to use them after his workout, one a day. He&#39;d grilled Ted about whether these were steroids - he couldn&#39;t be having his ideal future be derailed - and Ted confirmed it to him they were not, and wouldn&#39;t show up on any drug tests, claiming to be taking it himself.<br />
<br />
Brady bought the drug for eighty dollars - chump change for a man like him - and he went to workout as usual.<br />
<br />
He decided to make his choice when he was done. Brady promptly went forward again, hitting several more sets at 15 reps with 315 lbs. By the end of the exercise, Brady was breathing somewhat heavily, and he racked the weight with a grunt that could be heard around the gym. Squats were among Brady&#39;s favorite exercises, both for the condition they kept his legs in, and for the fact he could always see the gay guys thinking they were so concealed, trying to get a view of Brady&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
And today had been no different. Whole lot of guys just stopped by to watch Brady do his sets, and then walked off when he went to confront them. He chuckled to himself, &quot;Always love putting on a show and then breaking it to em that Brady Walker&#39;s no queer.&quot; He rolled up his shorts leg and flexed his quad, grinning at how it looked.<br />
<br />
Shortly after he got done, on his way over to the pec fly machine, one of the other guys from the team, a slim runningback named Joe, went to talk to him, &quot;Hey Brady uh...Coach is y&#39;know, making noise again about how you act around---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell Coach if he wants a different QB, he can TRY and find someone with my bevvy of talents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wuh...uh...what&#39;s a bevvy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brady felt like slapping his forehead, only not doing so because he didn&#39;t want to be dramatic, &quot;Oh right, forgot that little thing about you and your brain, Joey. Just tell Coach I&#39;m the best he has, he knows it, and to just let me be me.&quot; Brady then waved Joe off and went back to his workout.<br />
<br />
The rest of Brady&#39;s workout went by very quickly, and Brady was left looking down at the bottle of pills again. He was not exactly someone who was not used to supplements - he always smartly supplemented, doing every iota of research to prime and amplify his body. The morons who insisted on 100% Natty didn&#39;t know what they were missing. But this...looking up the label on there, Dexanabol, had given him nothing. It SOUNDED like a steroid, but no research turned up anything.<br />
<br />
Still, Ted had been blowing up at the gym lately, and if something like this could give a fat loser like Ted these kinds of results, he was eager to give it a try. Opening the bottle, Brady promptly took one of the pills and put it into his mouth. The taste was bitter, so he quickly swallowed it down and gulped down some water from his bottle to make sure it went quick.<br />
<br />
He swore he&#39;d give Ted SOME shit for giving him such a bitter pill. However, after taking the pill, his muscles started to feel a pleasant tingling sensation. Brady lightly fingered his bicep, admiring the shape and hardness of the musculature. He put in a lot of work on his big, muscular arms. He chuckled when he looked down at his shorts - seemed one of the side effects might be some sort of immediate kick to his libido.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm, looks like this is something Ms. Lambert is gonna need to take care of tonight!&quot; He said outloud to himself, and started to head out, noting as he did that his shirt and shorts were chafing against his boulder shoulders and thighs respectively. He wondered if before he went to go have sex with his girl he should go and get some new clothes. These ones HAD been pretty tight lately. However as he headed out he thought about whether he even should stay with Lambert if he was getting horny like this even after marathon sex.<br />
<br />
Maybe, he thought, tonight I should head to one of the local clubs?<br />
<br />
What he did not see was the immediate slight effects on the muscular build he was so proud of. His wide lats if anything pressing out larger and wider, developing tone and size, his biceps pushing from 20 inches to 21, and the quads and thighs on his legs each expanding another inch. If anything, his broad, powerful abs deepened and strengthened...</p>
