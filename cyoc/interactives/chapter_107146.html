<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>BACKTRACKING</b> (because I was at work all day and am just now getting back to these threads...)<br />
<br />
As William and Martha Anderson left their house and prepared to walk next door to their friends and neighbors Samantha and Frances Twist, they saw the Twists&#39; adopted son Ben locking the front door behind him as he prepared to leave.<br />
&quot;Hot date tonight?&quot; William asked the boy, although he could guess with who.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ben shyly, while scratching the back of his head with his right hand, expressing the nervous tic he sometimes displayed.<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t keep you,&quot; promised Martha. &quot;Are your mothers home?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kind of,&quot; replied Ben. &quot;Frances was out most of the day counseling, and despite being tired, now she&#39;s taking care of Samantha, who isn&#39;t feeling well right now.&quot; Ben didn&#39;t add that the counseling was with the Stovalls over their current problems, nor that Frances was now consoling Samantha over whatever nightmare his mother had experienced that she wouldn&#39;t talk to him about.*<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too bad. I hope both of them get to feeling better soon,&quot; said Martha, knowing that put a serious crimp in their plans for the evening.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure a good night&#39;s rest will take care of everything,&quot; said Ben, not mentioning that when he left, his mothers were planning to enjoy a long and private bubble bath together.<br />
&quot;Say, I was wondering about something Ben,&quot; began William. &quot;When older weres like my wife and I are at loose ends and don&#39;t have anywhere special to go, like a neighbor&#39;s or a group meeting or what not, is there any place they can go and maybe...&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; began Ben, while scratching the back of his head again, &quot;I do know of one place. But you have to be at least 21 to enter, which has kept me from visiting it. You also have to already be an active were**, and females have to prove they&#39;re on their were birth control pills before you get past the front door.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think we can cover all of that,&quot; said Martha confidently, while briefly showing Ben the prescription bottle in her purse, since they had originally hoped to spend the night with his mothers.<br />
&quot;Okay. It&#39;s on the other side of Moon Lake, but still in town, and only open Saturday nights except holidays. The place is called <i>The Were Club</i> but technically only adults are supposed to know about it, so we never had this conversation. Understand?&quot; asked Ben.<br />
The Andersons agreed and Ben gave them directions.<br />
<br />
With that, they walked back to their car and drove past what stood for the downtown area of Moon Lake and beyond the local seat of government (town hall, etc) until they came to what might pass for an abandoned building except for a couple of things that said otherwise.<br />
The surrounding parking lot had a lot of parked cars in it, and despite all the windows of the two story structure being either boarded over or painted black, any were when close enough could hear music coming from inside.<br />
The two werewolves at the lone front door acting as bouncers were also a clear indication that something was going on inside.<br />
&quot;IDs,&quot; the wolf on the right asked as William and Martha approached, while the one on the left sniffed them.<br />
&quot;Werefox and werevixen,&quot; said the other werewolf, as the first looked over their drivers&#39; licenses.<br />
&quot;Birth control pills?&quot; asked the one who demanded to see ID, to which Martha showed him the bottle in her purse.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t recognize either of you. First time?&quot; asked the second werewolf.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied William.<br />
&quot;Okay. Lady inside will collect the cover charge and changing room rental. $20 for the man, women free, and lockers are $5 each. Changing room is unisex, and the only spot where nothing can happen except what a dressing room is supposed to be used for. Understood?&quot; the werewolf asked, eyeing them closely.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William said, while Martha simply nodded her head.<br />
&quot;Water, sodas, snacks, and the restrooms are free all night. Any other club amenities like liquor, meals, etc; are separate charges, but the bar closes at 2 and the kitchen at 4. The pool and hot tubs are a separate admission fee unless you&#39;re an aquatic were, then those are free too. No one charges anyone for their... <i>favors</i> and nothing illegal, by the laws of Moon Lake and Washington state happens inside. Above all, remember: no MEANS no!&quot;<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re still here in the morning,&quot; began the other werewolf, &quot;there will be a half hour warning before dawn, then ALL activities must end within 15 minutes of that. At that time you will be expected to resume your human forms, get dressed and go home. But above all, HAVE FUN,&quot; he said pleasantly, as a smile crossed his muzzle.<br />
With that, the werewolf opened the door and let them inside.<br />
&quot;Does Nate come across that menacingly at times when he&#39;s furry?&quot; Martha whispered to William, but her husband just shrugged his shoulders as they walked in.<br />
<br />
Within the darkened corridor, for there were no actual lights but most weres didn&#39;t need any to begin with, was a weretigress behind a counter next to another door. She collected $30 from William, then pushed a buzzer that opened the new door.<br />
Stepping through, William and Martha found themselves in the well lit dressing room. Selecting two lockers next to each other side by side that still had keys in the doors, the couple quickly stripped, secured their clothing, then assumed their respective fursonas.<br />
Taking them out of the doors, William and Martha found each key was on a very large lanyard that easily slipped over their furry necks.<br />
With that, they followed the music that was still playing through the long maze of lockers until they came across another door.<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; asked William, while holding Martha&#39;s paw in his.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, as he pushed the swinging door open with his free paw.<br />
<br />
The sight that greeted them was quite a surprise.<br />
The Were Club looked like a regular dimly lit nightclub, with a bar, chairs and tables for lounging about and chatting with other people. There was even a dance floor and a weremonkey on a podium serving as the club&#39;s disc jockey. A set of glass doors past the dance floor showed indications of that being the area where the pool and hot tubs the werewolf bouncers mentioned were located.<br />
But everyone present was a were. Absolute no one was in their normal human form, and overall there had to be close to a 100 beings there.<br />
What was even more amazing was that there were private areas set aside in the far corners where it was fairly obvious that couples, threesomes, and higher numbers were enjoying the more sexual aspects of each other&#39;s company.<br />
There was a staircase against one wall, and the Andersons followed it visually with their eyes from where they were standing and saw the open floor plan of the second level. There, the only thing going on was sex, sex, and more sex.<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like we came to the right place,&quot; the werefox said to his mate with a smile.<br />
&quot;It certainly does,&quot; agreed his werevixen, as William and Martha smelled the heady scent of arousal coming from themselves and just about everyone else in The Were Club.<br />
