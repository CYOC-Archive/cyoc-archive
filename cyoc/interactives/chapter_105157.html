<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate gave a triumphant howl as he felt his body assume its wolven shape shortly after he and Alex had finished their dinner. It wasn&#39;t the most high class dinner, but it went fairly well and Nate was grateful his mistake with water wasn&#39;t too catastrophic. It made for a good cooking lesson and allowed him and Alex to set up their motivations for what was to come after, which was decidedly sexual in nature. The two of them had tried hard to look into other things than just the sex they had been having, and for the most part they had succeeded in that. However, both of them were still weres and still had a were&#39;s libido, which Nate had really come to enjoy since his initial transformation. Sure it was different from what he&#39;d felt as a human, but it was also so very fun.<br />
<br />
So, while Alex began putting out the fire, Nate let himself shift into his wolven form. His chest barreling out with powerful muscles, his arms and legs gaining the same additional definition of musculature, and as brown fur began to cover him and make his body feel warm in the night air. There seemed to be something rather arousing just from the process of transforming as he felt his penis rise from its sheath as he transformed, relishing his growing fur, the lengthening of his feet to bring him into a more digitigrade stance, the sharp claws that pushed out from his fingers and toes, and as his teeth sharpened. He got a real rush of power as he transformed, just as werewolves always seemed to in his movies, but unlike them, Nate&#39;s mind remained perfectly clear. Even as his face pushed forward into a lupine muzzle and a brown tail blossomed out behind him, he could still remember everything that he&#39;d ever learned in school and the love for his family. It was this that really made becoming a werewolf a dream come true for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it seems you got started without me,&quot; Alex looked back to him as he finished dealing with the fire, their campsite beginning to grow dark without the flames to light the area, though not that either werewolf NEEDED the fire to see clearly. Alex felt his own member begin to rise to attention as he looked at Nate&#39;s wolven form, his golden eyes practically glowing, and his large canine member standing firmly erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d gotten the left over food put away and had nothing else to do,&quot; Nate smiled back and spoke in as tender a voice as he could manage in his werewolf form. He still marveled at how much deeper his voice sounded after transforming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Alex replied as he smiled back to his boyfriend and thought over a few ideas on what to do for the night as he began to strip off his own clothing, &quot;before we get started... there is something you&#39;ll have to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Nate asked as he watched Alex throw his clothes into their tent, his nose easily picking up the scent of Alex&#39;s arousal, and his ears picking up the pleasure filled sounds from some of the other campsites where some weres had had the same idea that Nate and Alex had for the weekend.<br />
<br />
Alex tossed the last of his clothing into the ten and stood before Nate, totally naked not the least bit ashamed. His member was fully erect and he was more than ready for the night&#39;s activities, but he had a bit of a plan and smiled as he noticed Nate&#39;s leg muscles twitching. Nate might not fully know what Alex had planned, but it was clear he was ready for it. Nate&#39;s eyes were also focused on him and his triangular wolf ears perked forward with curiosity and his tail wagging with some eagerness for what was to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Catch me,&quot; Alex teased and then bolted out of the campsite, hurdling his car, and making a bee-line for the trail that they had hiked up earlier in the day.<br />
<br />
Nate was slightly surprised, but eagerly gave chase. At first he thought he&#39;d have an easy go of it because he was already transformed and Alex wouldn&#39;t be able to just instantly transform, but he found that his boyfriend could change quickly and by moving first had gotten a decent head start. By the time Nate did begin to catch up, Alex&#39;s feet had already lengthened into digitigrade wolf paws with his hands becoming something of a cross between a human hand and a wolf&#39;s paw. As he ran, Nate watched as Alex assumed a more quadrupedal stance as he continued to change. His muscles growing to propel him forward. Alex&#39;s ears rose into two triangular furry points on the top of his head while he felt his tail grow out behind him, helping him with balance as he ran.<br />
<br />
Alex managed a smile as he felt his muzzle grow as he listened to Nate continuing his pursuit. His member was still very much erect, but without his pants to put pressure on it, moving wasn&#39;t too bad and he knew that would also keep Nate aroused and eager in his own pursuit, and now in his wolven form, the trail they&#39;d hiked up would be even easier than it was before. By now, he hoped Nate had some idea on what he had planned.<br />
<br />
Nate did enjoy the game of the pursuit that Alex lead him on as his powerful legs easily covered the distance the trail covered. His greatly enhanced stamina allowing him to run at full speed and not even feel winded. He&#39;d never run so fast before or for so long. He&#39;d figured he would have dropped from exhaustion about a hundred yards back if he were still the Normal that had come to Moon Lake from Minnesota. But he wasn&#39;t a Normal anymore. He was a were, like every member of his immediate family now, with Eric joining were society the previous day, and specifically, Nate was a werewolf. Nate seemed to know that his wolf could run for a long time and with Alex&#39;s aroused scent drifting down to him, he had plenty of ideas of what to do after he caught up with his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
The two of them easily ascended the trail and made it to the viewing platform at the end of it that they&#39;d been on earlier in the day. There were a few short pants, but neither Alex nor Nate were that tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you remembered what I wanted to do earlier?&quot; Nate asked with a smile as Alex finally stopped and allowed Nate to approach him<br />
<br />
&quot;It may not be a full moon tonight,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;but it isn&#39;t as though you had a bad idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them came together and kissed, muzzle to muzzle, and both got a bit of a sexual tingle as their respective penises touched each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it&#39;d be fun,&quot; Nate then said after a moment, &quot;and after that chase... I can think of something else...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope it involves this,&quot; Alex stated as he reached down and wiggled Nate&#39;s member playfully and turned around, raising his tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;After watching you run from behind,&quot; Nate gave a smile and moved closer to his boyfriend, &quot;and seeing how good you look...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex felt himself tense in anticipation and then gave a deep, almost hissing breath, as Nate began to enter him from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d better believe that it will,&quot; Nate smiled playfully nibbled on Alex&#39;s ears as he began to pound into his boyfriend, &quot;and then... you&#39;ll get your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait,&quot; Alex answered as he felt Nate&#39;s hands wrap around him and soon began manipulating his own erection as they continued. Twin howls of male passion soon followed and carried into the night air, with no one but the stars and moon to see them.</p>
