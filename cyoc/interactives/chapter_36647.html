<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Meanwhile, back at the Anthro-Haus, everyone that had eaten there had began to undergo their change into their werewolf versions so the restaurant was empty. This left quite a problem for Shane as he too started to change because of all the others changing around him and was left to remain with his slight changes to revert completely back to normal. For Shane, he wanted at least one newbie to himself as he hadn't had anyone for a while.</Br>
<Br>As Shane sat there, sulking to himself, his keen ears picked up the sound of a new customer walking into the restaurant. With the kitchen window being in a perfect spot to view all new customers without them knowing, Shane stood on his feet and peered across the vast emptiness. Shane's eyes widened, his eyebrows raised, as he looked at the new diner that had taken a seat very close to the kitchen window. The new guy was 6'1" tall, average build, slight gut with an approximate weight of 235lbs, reddish light brown hair, scraggly beard and moustache that looked as if he couldn't really grow much more than what he had. If Shane had to guess, he would have put the guy in his mid-twenties and if he had to have a number, he'd guess that the guy was 24. A smile formed on Shane's lips, curling slightly at the ends, knowing that he was in total luck, getting the cutest guy to himself.</Br>
<Br>Feeling how he did about this new guy, Shane's fangs lengthened and he could feel his muscles bulk up again, but held his change back so that he could meet him and change him so that Shane could have this newbie to himself. The first thing Shane knew that he had to do was greet him, give him the customary three brews while inviting him to the cook's table and then lock the doors so no one else could come in and spoil Shane's fun.</Br>
<Br><Center>* * * View Point Changes * * *</Center></Br>
<Br>As David felt hungry, the urge and desire to eat brought him into this restaurant which had the motif of a German beer house, with just tables and chairs set up to feed hundreds, if not thousands. To his dismay however, David found that the entire place was empty, but not just of customers... from what he could tell there were no staff members either. David did read on the front door that there was always someone there to serve the customer, even though it looked contrary, and just to seat himself where he felt most comfortable. Taking the instructions literally, David walked to the back of the restaurant to where what looked to be where the kitchen window was, then sat down and waited to be greeted.</Br>
<Br>David found that he didn‘t have to wait very long to be greeted and have his order taken. A very large and powerfully built man walked up to where David was sitting and smiled. As David looked at him, the first thing that came to his mind was the fact that he was about as tall as he was and that he was thickly built like that of a bull. All of his muscles were huge, but appeared to be soft at the same time. The man reminded David of all those power lifters that he had seen on the television at home. The man smiled and David just gazed into the man‘s eyes while noticing the man‘s sharper than normal teeth, but didn‘t think anything of it since he knew that it was customary in other cultures to modify even their teeth.</Br>
<Br>David just smiled at the man who was staring at him, seeming to be checking him out just as David did to him. Curious to what the man wanted, David decided to speak first.</Br>
<Br>“Are you going to be taking my order and serving me the food too?” His voice was middle toned, not reaching the deeper resonating tones he would liked to have had.</Br>
<Br>“Yeah, that is right sir! I will be taking your order, but there really isn‘t anything else on the menu that I can make. We hit a bigger rush than we ever had and all I can serve you is our Anthro-Haus Brew and the Wolfish Man‘s Platter.” The depth of his voice made David weak and if he had been standing, he probably would have melted at the sheer might of his deep and resonating voice. Suddenly, David even found himself to be jealous of the man before him. Not only did David want that type of voice, but he also wanted to have a body like he had.</Br>
<Br>“That‘s quite alright sir, I am not picky and from what I can see by the picture alone that I will be satisfied by whatever I am given.”</Br>
<Br>Shane just smiled his manly smile, showing off his teeth again to David. “That is very good to hear sir, as I have too many people that come here wanting everything to be made one way or another, which is quite challenging especially when we experience a rush that we just had.”</Br>
<Br>“Yeah, I am sure that can be a real big pain! By the way, please call me David as sir just makes me feel really old and I am only twenty-four.”</Br>
<Br>The big man just chuckled and David watched his whole torso shake with each individual chuckle. “Sure thing David and since we are on first names, call me Shane. Now if you want your food and drink to be served to you rather quickly, you  could have the extra seat with me at the chef‘s table. I was just about to close up shop and enjoy a Wolfish Man‘s Platter and a few brews myself.”</Br>
<Br>David‘s eyes went wide with shock, feeling overwhelmed by the offer to eat with him, but also embarrassed as he had barged in when Shane was about to close up. “You would let me do that? I can just leave since you were about to close up shop.”</Br>
<Br>“Oh yeah, it is not a big deal in the least. I would rather sit and eat with another soul than just by myself. If you want to eat with me, you are welcome to do so. Just go through the double doors right over there, go down the hallway and you will see the table with beer as well as a platter already made up. In fact, if you want you can have mine… I will just cook up another one for myself. I know that you are hungry just by the way I saw your eyes light up when I mentioned the food already being made.”</Br>
<Br>“Heh, well you are very observant! I am actually quite famished and would love to take you up on your offer, but…”</Br>
<Br>“Well then, that settles things for the both of us doesn‘t it? I will just go change the sign from open to  closed and then lock the door so that no one else can bother either of us while we enjoy our meals.” Shane finished with a sly grin on his face.</Br>
<Br>Since things were pretty much already decided for him, David just shrugged and headed off in the direction that Shane placed him in. When David walked into the kitchen, he saw a moderately lengthy hall that led to a room. While walking to where he thought was the chef‘s table, David saw that the walls weren’t really walls at all. In fact, they were panes of glass that allowed people to watch the brewing of the Anthro-Brew, the drink the big man had mentioned.  Walking into the room, David took immediate note of the décor, being nothing more than glass paned cabinets that had bottles of Anthro-Brew laying on their sides. In the middle of the room was the round table that had previously been set up for the big man to enjoy his meal. The smell of the food, the look of the pitcher of beer and the food, drove David wild with hunger along with thirst. He didn‘t really want to be a burden upon the man to make another meal, but he had said that David could eat and drink. David started to walk back out of the room, but turned toward the table and sat in front of the meal. Grabbing fork and knife in each hand, David went to it, eating every bite and drinking every drop of the pitcher that was oh so delicious.</Br>
<Br>As David set the eating utensils on the plate in front of him, the metal clanging against the porcelain dinnerware, the larger man walked into the room with a huge, toothy smile.</Br>
<Br>“Enjoy that meal did ya son?”</Br>
<Br>“Yes sir, in fact it was very delicious and filling.”</Br>
<Br>“Good to hear and please don‘t call me sir, I find that it makes me feel older than I am… just call me Shane.”</Br>
<Br>“Alright Shane, it‘s nice to meet you. My name is David and you can call me son if you like, as I know it is just a nickname of sorts.”</Br>
<Br>Shane smiled at David‘s response and looked at the expression on David‘s face, since expressions were worth several thousands of words. Shane chuckled a bit, showing off his sharp fang-like teeth. “You got a question for me there bud?”</Br>
<Br>“Actually I do… I thought you were preparing another meal for yourself?”</Br>
<Br>“Yes, that I am… in fact it is done and I am just waiting to get my first nibble!”</Br>
<Br>“Oh really! Where is it and why don‘t you join me at the table then. I really find men like you to be exceptionally attractive and I would like to know more about you.”</Br>
<Br>“To be honest, my meal is right here and you are about to get to know me more than you thought you would from just walking into a restaurant.”</Br>
<Br>“Huh? What are you talking about? There is no food in here, but I am glad to know that you are so willing to be completely open with a stranger.”</Br>
<Br>“I meant just what I said. I want you to know what all of the customers here find out after ingesting both the food and beer here.”</Br>
<Br>“Ok… and what would that be Shane?”</Br>
<Br>“That I am a werewolf and what you just ingested is changing your entire being as we speak!”</Br>
<Br>David‘s eyes widened with shock at the words just spoken. Shane is a werewolf and he is going to become one as well! David‘s heart soared with excitement, always wanting to be one, but never thought that it would ever happen since they were of stories and never proven to really exist. Now that David knew that simple truth, the obvious dawned on him, smacking him in the head like a fast moving object. He should have known something was different about Shane. His muscles were huge, bigger than he had ever seen even on the biggest power lifter. His teeth were sharp like fangs. His body hair grew thicker like fur from the first moment David saw Shane as he walked into the room. Curious to one thing, David had to ask the question.</Br>
<Br>“So… what exactly about me is your meal?”</Br>
<Br>“That‘s simple! First we both change, with me ending first since I am partially there now, then I get a helping of your soon to be cum filled and thicker cock. Of course that is when you are done changing, because then you will be able to give me the high volume of cum I hunger for! For now though, you can have a taste of what I have to offer as I really could use getting off right now.”</Br>
<Br>“Sounds good to me, I am really hungry for a huge load of cum all of a sudden!”</Br>
<Br>“Yeah, that is because your changes are already taking place and cum is what we use for sustenance.”</Br>
<Br>As hungry as David was now, he almost jumped out of his chair and stood chest to chest with the massive Shane. David grabbed Shane‘s crotch through his extremely tight denim shorts, rubbing just to make him a bit harder. Shane moaned in sexual delight, wanting David to release his snake and drain it. David rubbed harder this time, completely groping everything that he could fit in his hand. David dropped to his knees, that had already gotten more muscular and covered in his new fur, unbuttoned and unzipped Shane‘s shorts and let them fall to the floor below. David smiled, licking his lips, hungry to taste the beer bottle thick cockhead and shaft that was dripping with precum. David, still on his knees looked up at the completely changed, broadly buffed werewolf partner for approval and…</Br></p>
