<br />
Of course you love both your mother and Amy, and it was just natural for you to answer her back, which you did.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too.&quot; you gently whispered with your eyes closed and almost in a dream-like state imagining it was Amy though it felt quite different, but most importantly knowing it was a woman you loved.<br />
<br />
As your mouth and tongue began tasting hers, you noticed a difference from what you were use to with Amy&#39;s fruity lip gloss and her peppermint toothpaste or mouthwash. There was not any overpowering sweetness but just a natural, slightly salty tang. So different that it gave you a start, but then just seemed to melt perfectly in your mouth as your two tongues swished around together. And when you crushed her body to yours, her larger chest pressed into you with a force that not only felt so new and good but also stirred your male emotions. The taste and sensation of this different woman drove a typical male reaction in your body as you became more and more aroused.<br />
<br />
After a while of face-on-face and all your arms sliding up and down each other&#39;s backs, Amy&#39;s grip went down your back and into your pants lightly squeezing your cheeks like she does when she&#39;s really turned on. Then her hands moved around the side of your pants to the front and began to unbutton them still while your lips were locked together. Your manhood was throbbing to get loose and her actions just drove your arousal. Soon she began to push down your pants and boxers and broke loose from the sensuous kiss. You opened your eyes as you heard your mother&#39;s voice say, &quot;Alright now.&quot; and then saw your mother giving you a wink and a lustful smirk just before she stooped to pull your pants and boxers to your knees. Your manhood sprang forth bouncing like a spring board. Even though Amy had done this in the past, you were frozen in place watching your mother do it. When she stood and moved your mom&#39;s body against you, you tried to step back but stumbled backwards with your pants at your ankles and boxers at your knees. Falling onto the bed, you watched as your mom grabbed her skirt and hiked it up to show her cotton panties with a flowered print as she strode towards you and walked onto the bed with her knees straddling you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the ..&quot; you started to yell but were cut off when Amy shushed you and placed your mom&#39;s finger across your lips then whispered in a sultry low voice, &quot;Quiet, big boy, we don&#39;t want anyone to hear and find out what we&#39;re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mind started to panic with how wrong it was to have your mom on top of you, but your body screamed to know what it would be like. You had a brief thought of telling Amy what was going on, but couldn&#39;t bring yourself to figure out a way, so you just lay still. Well, as still as your throbbing horniness would allow.<br />
<br />
While you remained stunned, Amy reached back under your mom&#39;s shirt with both hands and you felt one encircle you and gently glide along you until you felt the tip being rubbed back and forth against a warm, moist area. Amy obviously had your mom&#39;s body very aroused and wanted to do you like she had many times before. This whole thing of seeing your mom kneeling over you, playing with your manhood and about to put it inside her had you both guilty and happy in anticipation. Your head went back and eyes to the ceiling then they just closed, partly from enjoyment and partly so you didn&#39;t watch your mother&#39;s body being the one giving you this pleasure.<br />
<br />
What happened then was beyond what you had ever expected or experienced with Amy using her body. Whether it was your highly charged conflicting emotions or the capabilities of your mom&#39;s body, you became overwhelmed with ecstasy and almost screamed and just about passed out, and you could see Amy was biting her lip hard to keep from screeching at the ceiling as she clamped down and began shaking all over from the orgasm. Finally she collapsed down on you, and the two of you remained for some time trembling together and catching your breath.<br />
<br />
Once you recovered, Amy lifted your Mom&#39;s face, and you looked up smiling and happy into your mom&#39;s sparkling green eyes. She smiled back and said, &quot;You were a real good boy today, John.&quot; Then she kissed you lightly on your cheek. Both of these actions were just the way your mom talked and kissed you when you did something special for her. It was just way to weird, and you almost freaked out as Amy rolled off you.<br />
<br />
As your mom&#39;s body swayed its way to the door, Amy told you that your mom had invited her for dinner and she was going to go help after she cleaned up. Then she blew you a kiss off her hand just like your mom does and winked before going out the door.<br />
<br />
You started shivering at this because all these mannerisms were so much like your mom that you couldn&#39;t be sure it wasn&#39;t her that you just did it with. You kept trying to convince yourself it was Amy, and finally got off the bed, pulled up your pants and went over to the computer to check and make sure the site was still there listing your last command for them to change minds.<br />
<br />
As you sat down and pushed the mouse to get the screensaver off, you were finally relaxing and thinking back again to all the other women&#39;s bodies you could now switch minds with Amy and do them, wondering if they would be as spectacular. When the browser window popped up, you saw the Morph.com site and gave a big sigh. The next decision was whether to swap them back once Amy went downstairs or leave them for a while. You still didn&#39;t know if only you would know of the change since your sister and dad hadn&#39;t been home or anything. Was it worth the chance since they would be home very soon for dinner? And would your mom know what had just happened to her body when her mind went back? Surely, she could feel the afterglow or, at least, the damp undies.</p>
