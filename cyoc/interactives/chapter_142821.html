<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike, having turned Jeff into a being without an individual identity, had unwittingly removed the computer that held the Chronivac from the house. The computer used to be Jeff&#39;s and was intended for writing up papers and doing research. Mike had his cell phone and didn&#39;t need a desktop computer in the house when he didn&#39;t have a son in high school. Thankfully, the program placed itself at Mike&#39;s work computer.<br />
<br />
After Jeff&#39;s stunt this morning and his retort, it was clear to Mike that his son just didn&#39;t appreciate the bonding experience Mike was offering. Giving over control over such a vital body part was a show of strength and trust which should be respected and appreciated, but instead, his sentient penis son is mocking him and attempting to sabotage his efforts.<br />
<br />
Mike sat at his computer and opened the Chroivac Software barely aware that it installed itself, Jeff made a complete nuisance of himself and rubbed his face against the wall, arousing them both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that Mike Junior! Err, I mean Jeff.&quot; Mike had made an honest error, this was part of the awareness changes. Jeff simply became offended and more fervently rubbed his body against the wall, Mike was limited in his options and chose to ignore Jeff. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time he denied his penis attention and it won&#39;t be the last, Mike thought.<br />
<br />
Mike looked at the Chronivac and saw there was an active transformation that was due to time out in 6 days and 8 hours. He clicked on the transformation to access it, and immediately noticed a Reverse button which he clicked on. A screen popped up with a quick and simple list of the changes he made with check boxes next to the options.<br />
<br />
Mike lurched forward in sudden surprise and pleasure, looking up, Jeff had been excreting pre-ejaculate fluid all over the office wall/door/and himself. This had minimized the level of distraction Jeff could make until now when Jeff had found the coat hanger protruding from the back of the door. The cold hard metal was pressing into Jeff&#39;s face and skull, stretching the skin and causing unexpected sensations. Mike could barely concentrate he was so horny, the only way to fix this was to finish with the programming and execute the commands. Mike was more than his penis!<br />
     Penis is human sized, uncheck.<br />
     Penis is sentient, uncheck.<br />
     Public wont react to seeing penis, uncheck<br />
     Penis is detached, uncheck.<br />
After designating that his penis will again be attached, Radio options came up regarding Identity. Same or Average where his choices. Mike presumed same would mean Jeff would still be thought of as an extension of Mike&#39;s body, so he selected average, IE go back to normal.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized he lost his dad&#39;s attention and was enraged! How could his dad possibly care about work more than his own son/penis? Jeff fell to the floor and began rubbing his face on the carpet, immediately making Mike stand up and groan in lust. <br />
 <br />
Mike was so horny now he couldn&#39;t focus, he needed to get off so desperately but Jeff was essentially throwing a temper tantrum and would fight him every step of the way. The last few commands needed to be entered. Awareness, 20% since Jeff didn&#39;t like this anyway. Duration, indefinite. Apply changes.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
27 months ago at Transdem Labs there were meetings going on constantly regarding the not yet released Chronivac 4.0. Aaron Johnson, a young technician assigned to the interface team, wholly believed that this device will be used primarily by couples to keep things fun, interesting, and ensure fidelity by lowering libido while away from your partner during the workday.<br />
<br />
Though his initial pitch failed, he went after it again from new angles. He believed the Reverse button belonged in every user interface where two people were changed together in complementary ways. This way, the fun didn&#39;t have to stop in order to reprogram the swapping of roles, simply click the reverse button and carry on. Eventually his efforts were successful however the User Oversight team didn&#39;t want a single button to be so powerful in case it was selected in error. They insisted there be a subset of applicable options that the user can change and clarification above the options indicating what the option will do. <br />
<br />
Though Aaron liked the idea of being able to make nuanced changes, who would possibly confuse Reverse, with Revert? The two are completely different.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Mike angrily looked at Jeff, &quot;Bathroom, Now!&quot; Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel cocky and was just pleased to be getting attention. Together they went into a single stall and Mike rubbed Jeff until they orgasmed, which only took a few seconds. <br />
<br />
Jeff vomited cum into the toilet and they both enjoyed post coitus bliss. By now it had been about 4 of the 10 minutes  and Jeff no longer looked penis like. His clothes has shifted back to normal attire and both he and Mike had penises of their own. Mike and Jeff could no longer sense one another and things seemed back to normal.<br />
<br />
Mike could easily see the changes to Jeff but Jeff wouldn&#39;t notice the changes to Mike so easily. So Mike explained. &quot;The machine is running to change you back, right now, as we speak. Looks like its about done too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff pushed his dad out of the way to get out of the stall and looked in the mirror, he had his own body back and felt like himself again. Jeff reached down and grabbed his penis. It somehow acted as proof that he wasn&#39;t someone else&#39;s penis. Dad groaned, &quot;Mmm, warm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Mike stumbling out of the stall, Mike&#39;s consciousness was quickly fading and his body was becoming penislike. Jeff was immediately flooded with emotions, namely panic, anger, and disgust. <br />
<br />
Mike lumbered over to Jeff and forced him into a hug. Jeff couldn&#39;t resist and noticed that Mike smelled youthful and like... Axe body wash? At this point Jeff realized that Mike must be trying to make a point of how wonderful he had it being a penis... or something like that, so switched their roles. Maybe this was his dads way of apologizing? Either way, Jeff reasoned, in a few minutes, Jeff can go back to the program and fix things. <br />
<br />
Mike was becoming more and more penis like by the second and Jeff was beginning to wonder why his dad would change the settings so much. In a sudden flurry of motion, Mike released the hug and yanked Jeff&#39;s pants down, and with a swat, Mike painlessly knocked off Jeff&#39;s penis and balls. Jeff was horrified as he watched them flop across the floor, stopping under the urinal. Looking back to Mike, Jeff realized that he was pinned against the bathroom counter. Mike&#39;s (now naked, somehow) body was pressing against his void crotch hole firmly, It only took a second for Jeff to realize he was now attached to his father. <br />
<br />
Mike, weighing much more than a 16 year old Jeff easily forced him to turn around and face the mirror. In the reflection Jeff saw what remained of his original penis evaporate into steam. Mike, used his arms to support himself on the counter and wiggled his right leg, which fell off and began evaporating like Jeff&#39;s penis. The same happened to the left leg. Mike was now legless and sitting on the counter top attached to Jeff&#39;s crotch. Mike raised his arms and began petting his head. Jeff felt this and couldn&#39;t bring himself to do anything but watch. Looking on Jeff noticed as  Mikes weight seemed to shift. All at once the weight from Mike&#39;s raised arms drained becoming thin and frail, his  pecks and beginning moobs flattened and his stomach ballooned out. The way Mike&#39;s stomach laid alerted Jeff to the fact that it was his new ball sac complete with two watermelon sized balls. Mike was completely bald on his head and his body was now about a foot in diameter. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at what remained of Mike&#39;s face and they shared a final look, before Mike lowered himself to the counter top. Mike&#39;s arms detached as his head lolled back became a normal penis head, if over-sized. <br />
<br />
Jeff waited a moment and nothing more seemed to be happening. Jeff was terrified that his dad had left him with a human torso sized, 150 lb penis with watermelon sized balls. He pulled away from the counter and surprisingly he was able to step back and had a seemingly normal, 8 inch penis and balls attached to his body.<br />
<br />
This was about 1 and a half times his normal size. It looked like a fully grown adult penis, and the balls hung lower than his used to but it fit in his pants, so he was happy. Detaching from the rest of what used to be his father, triggered it to begin turning into steam. As he looked toward the mirror he saw what looked like hair expanding out from his crotch.<br />
<br />
Lifting his shirt Jeff could see there was clearly a change happening, radiating from his new penis. The change was easiest to track by hair growth which was very obvious. The change had made it down to his knees and up to his nipples, and was still creeping forward. Jeff couldn&#39;t do anything but watch, so that&#39;s what he did.<br />
<br />
The change was covering his body with an adult pelt of hair. not a treasure trail, not some hair on his tummy, but the amount of a 30 year old. This is the side effect of averaging the identities of a 16 and 44 year old. Jeff grew taller and watched as his musculature shifted as the wave of change enveloped him. The physical changes washed over him quickly and Jeff was almost sad he couldn&#39;t enjoy the changes more slowly. <br />
<br />
Beard stubble pushed itself out of Jeff&#39;s face as the beginnings of wrinkles started on his forehead. Jeff leaned closer to the mirror and examined his scalp, in disbelief. Carefully, he plucked out his first gray, &quot;That shouldn&#39;t happen for another decade!&quot; he thought to himself sadly, knowing full well that he is no longer a 20 year old kid.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized suddenly that his pants were down so he reached down and pulled them up. The dress slacks wrapped around his 40 inch waist and he tucked in the button down shirt. His beer belly and grays seem to be coming in early Jeff scoffed to himself.<br />
<br />
In Jeff&#39;s office, (formerly Mike&#39;s) the Chronivac beeped completion. Awareness reduced to 20% (vivid and haunting dream).</p>
