<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When their parents pulled into the driveway late Sunday evening, it was as if Aaron&#39;s prayers had been answered. Another day attending to Kyle&#39;s needs had left him exhausted--another day of edging his giant younger brother&#39;s cock and balls; another day of worshiping the massive, sweaty muscles as they lifted unimaginably heavy weights; another day of being brutally fucked by an impossibly-sized dick. He had gotten a break on Saturday night, when Kyle made his rounds at college parties, but Sunday had been business as usual. The sound of their parents&#39; car arriving was like a choir singing in perfect harmony.<br />
<br />
Naturally, Kyle and Aaron&#39;s parents were oblivious to what their boys had been up to for the week. They doled out hugs as they arrived, assuring their boys that Aunt Bea would be fine. Kyle in particular was quite concerned about their mother&#39;s elderly aunt. Aaron of course knew the real reason Kyle suggested that Aunt Bea might not be well enough to be left alone--the hulking brute wanted another week of unfettered access to his older brother! <br />
<br />
Happily for Aaron, their parents were resolute: Aunt Bea was fine, and would call if she needed them. <br />
<br />
Aaron was relatively quiet through dinner. His week had been “fine” and nothing of interest had happened--or so he said when queried. Kyle was a bit more animated, talking about things at school and so on. They were bald fabrications, as Kyle had skipped the whole week, but their parents bought it, hook, line, and sinker. More to Aaron&#39;s shock, neither of them seemed all that surprised that Kyle had surpassed a quarter ton of mass; their mother just loaded up extra helpings for “our growing boy” and their father beamed as Kyle casually discussed his workouts (omitting Kyle&#39;s precise role in them). By the time dinner was over, Dad had promised to buy additional weight plates the next day. <br />
<br />
That night, Kyle fucked Aaron ferociously. He was angry that they would be back to school that week, angry that he wouldn&#39;t have daylong, lust-enhanced workouts in the basement. “I want you back here by three sharp, every day,” he growled into Aaron&#39;s ear as he came, his giant rod shooting a huge load into his older brother&#39;s aching ass. “You pull that &#39;I&#39;m-working-late&#39; shit with me again and I&#39;ll hunt you down and make you regret it,” he added, punctuating the threat with a forceful thrust of his spasming cock. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
True to his word, their father bought Kyle a small fortune worth of extra weight plates. He left work early on Monday to do it and pulled Kyle out of school early as well, then took him down to an exercise equipment supply store; “Because you&#39;ll have to carry them out!” their father had laughingly explained. When they arrived, everyone stared at the young behemoth; none had ever seen a 625-pound muscleman before. When Kyle suggested a “bulk discount” on weights, the manager readily agreed, nodding dumbly before giving Kyle and his father fifty percent off the total. Even with the discount they spent a thousand dollars, netting a full ton of additional plates, plus several more bars to replace those that were beginning to bend from the strain Kyle put them under. <br />
<br />
That day, and every day that week, Aaron was home by three. The first day, he went up to his room, unpacked his things, and began looking over his homework. He barely heard the door to his room open; rather, it was the heavy footsteps that alerted him to Kyle&#39;s presence, accompanied by a dimming of the light as Kyle&#39;s massive body blocked the beams of the lamp overhead. <br />
<br />
“You&#39;re late,” Kyle growled, putting one big hand on Aaron&#39;s shoulder, engulfing it. Aaron could feel the callouses on Kyle&#39;s palms, rough and blistered, noticeable through Aaron&#39;s tee shirt. The older brother&#39;s heart beat swiftly in his chest as he filled with alarm. <br />
<br />
“I was home by three, just like you said!” Aaron protested, confused why he was in trouble. He had followed his brother&#39;s instructions to the letter, had he not? <br />
<br />
Kyle let out a scoffing laugh. “I didn&#39;t tell you to get home by three so you could do your fucking... calculus or whatever. I told you to be here by three so you could come down and do your job!” <br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s heart skipped a beat and his stomach sank. “Still?” he asked in a quiet voice, a tremor running through it. <br />
<br />
“Until I say otherwise!” Kyle roared in response, roughly pulling Aaron up out of his chair. Minutes later they were down in the basement, the door locked behind them. Kyle stripped down as usual, then forced Aaron to remove his clothes as well. “Just look at you,” Kyle sneered, “Used to be a stud, now you&#39;re a dud!” He laughed at his own lame joke, then lay back on a bench, gripping the bar, which was loaded down with weight plates old and new. “I expect you to try extra hard today, to make up for being late, and for making me stop my workout to find your scrawny ass!” <br />
<br />
Aaron indeed worked extra hard that day. He was extra diligent as he worked over Kyle&#39;s huge cock and balls, as he licked and groped and massaged his brother&#39;s monstrous muscles. When the workout was finally over, Aaron was exhausted. His frail body was slick with sweat, and he could barely stand, he was so drained. His body was limp like a rag doll as Kyle picked him up fucked him, the traditional conclusion to one of his epic workouts. “Not bad, bro,” Kyle commented as he rammed his oversized dick into Aaron&#39;s aching hole, “I could tell you were trying extra hard. That&#39;s good. Since I don&#39;t have all day to work out any more, you&#39;ll need to keep that up. I expect that kind of performance every time, from now on!” <br />
<br />
Additional instructions followed. The rest of the week was a blur to Aaron--a blur that prominently featured Kyle&#39;s enormous body. Even though his brother wasn&#39;t growing as fast as before, he was still expanding prodigiously, becoming an even larger, even more freakish mountain of muscle and cock than before. Every morning when Aaron woke up, he went straight to Kyle&#39;s room. Invariably Kyle would be fast asleep, his giant cock hard as a rock, and it was Aaron&#39;s task to wake him with a blowjob. After a more traditional breakfast they would go their separate ways to different schools, giving Aaron a respite for that part of the day. But at three in the afternoon sharp he would be in the basement, naked, and would then spend the following three hours as Kyle&#39;s dutiful slave. <br />
<br />
Even with that routine in place, and even with Aaron&#39;s best efforts, Kyle&#39;s growth slowed. He was still getting bigger, of course, his muscles swollen to inhuman size, his cock and balls impractically large. He continued to fuck Aaron with his growing equipment, the older brother&#39;s ass never fully recovering as it was stretched wider and wider by the increasingly-girthy shaft that plowed it after every workout and every evening. <br />
<br />
On Saturday, Kyle kept Aaron busy in the basement for most of the day, a nonstop orgy of lifting and sex that was only interrupted for occasional protein breaks. By evening, Kyle was so pumped he looked ready to burst. “Measurement time,” he said simply, striding toward the large scale, his giant legs fighting for space. <br />
<br />
First they checked his height: “Seven-foot-two,” Aaron said, after measuring from the floor to the line high up on the wall, something that required the older brother to stand on a chair and on his toes as well. <br />
<br />
“Not bad,” Kyle remarked, stepping onto the scale. <br />
<br />
“800,” Aaron added, watching the numbers rise on the new industrial-use scale their father had bought, after Kyle&#39;s weight exceed the first&#39;s capacity. <br />
<br />
“Wanna be bigger,” Kyle huffed, sounding annoyed, “Wanna be a thousand!” <br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s eyes bugged out at that. Didn&#39;t Kyle realize how massive he was? Didn&#39;t he realize he was too big already? Aaron kept those thoughts to himself as he stretched the measuring tape along Kyle&#39;s enormous erection. “Twenty-one...” he stammered. <br />
<br />
“Think they&#39;ll let me drink with it?” Kyle joked, his foul mood of a moment earlier brightening as he reached down to grab his huge shaft, giving it a few shakes. “I could honestly tell them I&#39;m twenty-one now... not that anyone has been turning me down for drinks yet!” <br />
<br />
Aaron kept silent. He still remembered how poorly things had gone, the last time he noted that Kyle was too young to drink. <br />
<br />
“Speaking of which, I think I&#39;ll give you the night off,” Kyle added, “There&#39;s a college party tonight--what did they call it? Oh yeah, an &#39;orgy.&#39; Apparently I&#39;m the star!” He laughed, strutting over to a large sink to wash up. “Just sex, sex, sex! I mean, all the other parties have been too, once I got there and worked my magic. This one is official from the start, though!” Kyle strutted over to a new, extra-large mirror, and began to flex and pose, admiring his giant body--even if it was “only” 800 pounds--imagining all the attention he was going to get that night. <br />
<br />
Aaron was still silent. He knew that he should feel offended--or at least awkward--about his younger brother being a sex object. But all he felt was relief: he was going to get a night when Kyle&#39;s sexual energies would be directed somewhere other than Aaron&#39;s small ass. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The following morning, Aaron woke up feeling amazing. He stretched languidly, and was surprised when his hand brushed against the wall behind his bed. He rolled over, the sheets tangled around him, his whole body feeling different. He tumbled out of bed, feeling stronger and better than ever! <br />
<br />
As Aaron cast the sheets aside, he looked up into his mirror. His old, athletic body was back, but it looked even better than before: his muscles were firm and defined and his bodyfat was low--he had never been so ripped before! But it was his dick, hanging between his legs that brought him true joy. It rapidly hardened, and he rushed to find a ruler. A moment later confirmed what he already knew: not only did he have his nine inches back, he had half an inch more!<br />
<br />
Aaron fell back in bed, slowly stroking his tool, loving the fact that the curse that had turned the prior three weeks into a living hell was finally over! He worked his dick over slowly, sensuously, not wanting to cum too soon, determined to enjoy the first proper bit of self-pleasure he&#39;d had in weeks. <br />
<br />
The door to Aaron&#39;s room opened, and Kyle stepped in. Aaron froze, his hand wrapped around his dick, staring. Kyle had not reverted to his old form--he remained a tower of bloated, hairy muscle and huge, veiny cock. Even his face looked hypermasculine and grown up, with its square jaw and thick beard. The massive young behemoth locked the door behind him, then slowly advanced toward the bed. “I see you got your &#39;big&#39; dick back, &#39;big&#39; bro,” Kyle snickered mockingly. “But I know that nothing will satisfy you like the real deal.” He grabbed his huge shaft and shook it in Aaron&#39;s direction. “I learned a new word at the orgy last night: &#39;bitch.&#39; Apparently that&#39;s what you are, Aaron. You&#39;re my bitch.” Kyle began advancing toward Aaron, a wolfish grin on his face.</p>
