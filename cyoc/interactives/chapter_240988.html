<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Valentines Day was something that went all across much of the Christian world, and in some ways, it would have the potential to transcend cultures, and for Animalia and its colonies, this was no exception. This of course produced various ways the day was celebrated, particularly that it was a Friday and thus part of the regular week...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
There were some times when Eliza wished that every school district had Fridays off. Of course, she also knew that the schools that ran a four-day week, that really only mattered for the students. Teachers and staff still had to come in, and either work on lesson plans, grading, or something related to that. But the pressure on a day when the students weren&#39;t in wasn&#39;t as big. But, WSA wasn&#39;t one of those districts and they did have school. As she came into the main office for the high school section, she could smell some of the store-bought flowers along with the scent of chocolate. It was a scent that smelled nice, though Eliza knew that as a Cat Animalian, chocolate was a strict &quot;no-no.&quot; The big thing was more that it reminded her on what the day was, Valentines Day. She waved and said good morning to the secretaries as she made her way to her office and set about her work.<br />
<br />
This was a part where the fact that it was Valentine&#39;s Day hit her rather hard. She had a Valentine in Beth, and their marriage was loving. Some of the biggest issues that were &quot;there&quot; were joking quips that Eliza&#39;s loving purrs could keep Beth awake at night, but Eliza knew that was all in jest. The two of them also worked along with their own schedules, as Beth taught in a town in California that was just across the border from where Lyre/Animalia was in Nevada. It meant that Beth had longer drive to work than Eliza did, but they&#39;d often made things manage. They got up together, enjoyed breakfast, gripe about whatever nonsense there was to be griped on and wish each other a good day before Beth headed out. Eliza had figured that she would get a special kiss or a nuzzle from Beth before she left that came with a mention of &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; but she didn&#39;t get that. In fact, Beth left in a bit of a hurry that morning.<br />
<br />
That left Eliza with some busy work, which on one hand had to be done, but on the other hand wasn&#39;t something she really wanted to mess with.  Some related to things coming from the state government, and since late January there was an increase of things coming from the federal government, all of which Eliza saw as an intrusion, but not something she could truly get away from. It interfered with the standard work she did as a principal in managing the affairs of the high school, be it coordinating with the staff or other school business, but she&#39;d long known that these sorts of things also didn&#39;t care if they were intrusive. She settled into the work to read it over, at least, though as she went through it, it only increased her wish that Beth had said, &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
At about ten AM, there came at knock on her door. She answered and found one of the secretaries there. There was a knowing smile on the woman&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The mail&#39;s here, and you got something rather important,&quot; the secretary smiled and lifted up a small red envelope.<br />
<br />
Eliza was totally surprised by this. It was too small to be regular stationary and definitely too small to be major paperwork, and the red color to the envelope stood out. Though as she took the envelope and thanked the secretary, she soon found out why. It wasn&#39;t a business note that related to work. It was a personal card that actually came from Beth. As she flipped over to check card, she found WSA&#39;s address with the main addressee being &quot;My Dear Lizzie.&quot; Beth&#39;s name and their home address was then on the sender&#39;s side of the card. Finding herself smiling, she came back to her desk and extended one claw to use as a letter opener. <br />
<br />
The card wasn&#39;t much, though Eliza couldn&#39;t say she hated it. It an AI image of what looked like her and Beth in a tag team pro wrestling match with two male pro wrestlers with the images of Eliza and Beth nuzzling their muzzles together while the pro wrestlers looked like they were howling in defeat. She then opened it to have fairly simple font for the wording on the card, but Eliza didn&#39;t mind that. She simply read what was written: &quot;I hope you aren&#39;t too upset, Lizzie, but I wanted this to be a bit of a surprise. Always know that I love you very much and have helped me in so many ways. You&#39;re most special kitty I know, and I wanted to make this Valentines Day special. I know it&#39;s not our first... or our first as a married couple, but it&#39;s still Valentines Day. And when we&#39;re together we can take anyone on. We&#39;d rule as a pro-wrestling tag team. We&#39;d school them all!&quot; Eliza stopped reading to giggle. &quot;But our careers keep us busy and there are sometimes where I&#39;m busy with grading papers or have to stay late for parent teacher conferences and you&#39;ve put up with all of that. Words alone cannot say how thankful I am. So, with today being a Friday, and I have nothing that should keep me on the job too late, I&#39;ve made a reservation at our favorite restaurant. I look forward to taking you there for dinner and letting you watch my tail wag as I tell you how beautiful you are. Your Loving Wife, Beth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you did say Happy Valentines Day,&quot; Eliza smiled to herself as she looked over the card again and feeling joy rise in her heart, &quot;you didn&#39;t need to surprise me... but... you&#39;ve set a nice tone. And tonight, I&#39;ll love you so much that you&#39;ll purr.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nice,&quot; Malice said to Simon as they sat at one of the benches in the park.<br />
<br />
This was one of the few times in the day when they could often meet. Simon was busy with his work as an officer with the Animalia PD and was often busy with patrols and various public relations exercises, but they did give him some time for lunch and when things were quiet enough, they could meet and enjoy a lunch together. Malice loved it, as her work as the manager for Animalia Ambassadoria was more regular and for the moment things weren&#39;t too hectic. The Year of the Snake had Animalia Ambassadoria in Lyre/Animalia to cover the event, thus there were no need for immediate travel arrangements. There were some things that related to Animalia Magazine and the related media sources, but for Malice that was more consulting than anything else and retained a fairly regular schedule. That gave her the time to work in the lunches with Simon when he didn&#39;t have something come up that would keep him busy during the lunch hour.<br />
<br />
Simon glanced over the rather empty park for the moment. The air was cool to cold and wasn&#39;t entirely conducive to dining outdoors. But he and Malice both had their winter coats in, and the cold wasn&#39;t too much of a problem for them. With Malice being a Siberian Husky Animalian, Simon also knew that his wife could well endure cold weather. She&#39;d also joyfully placed video she&#39;d found online of a husky laying on a snow-covered dog bed on a deck and after a Human says, &quot;come on, let&#39;s go inside&quot; the dog gives a bark that sounds like a soft &quot;no&quot; as her phone&#39;s ringtone. Simon had asked once if she&#39;d ever got into those sorts of antics before she was uplifted. Malice&#39;s answer was that as a puppy, it was probably more cases of &quot;singing&quot; with Sarah that had been the closest that she&#39;d ever gotten to that. Simon figured that&#39;d then have to be something he asked Thomas and Julia or Sarah, though preferably on a day where there wouldn&#39;t be any risk of trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have something else I know you&#39;ll like,&quot; Simon commented as he reached into his paper bag.<br />
<br />
The pair of them had enjoyed some slices of ham and beef, and it was good. But with the day being Valentines Day, Simon had something special to give his wife. He found it carefully hidden at the bottom of the bag and pulled it out. He presented it to Malice, who was soon smiling and wagging her tail behind her. It was colored brown and in the shape of a heart, but it wasn&#39;t chocolate. Chocolate was toxic to dogs and wolves, and that included Dog and Wolf Animalians. Carob products, weren&#39;t, however, and since they could taste like chocolate, it would work for Valentines Day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carob Hearts,&quot; Simon finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweets!&quot; Malice cheered, &quot;I love them! When did you get these?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made them,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;I got off early on one day while you were putting Snow Princess through her paces and thus had the time... So, I made them and stashed them in the freezer, so they&#39;d keep.&quot;<br />
<br />
He watched as Malice took the offered treat and tossed it into her mouth. She chewed and chomped on it with the biggest smile that Simon had ever seen. The treat hadn&#39;t been too hard to make. Procuring some of the ingredients had been difficult, but once they came in, they made for a good treat, and he was happy to see Malice smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did well,&quot; Malice smiled, &quot;I only wish I had something that good for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your smile is all I need,&quot; Simon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but you deserve more,&quot; Malice said with a fairly husky tone, &quot;though, that may have to wait until later...&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon smiled back, &quot;I can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ella and Simone were quite pleased with the crowd they got. Lyre had never been super big on the social scene before Animalia, generally because of its small size and the fact that while &quot;everyone knew everyone,&quot; that hadn&#39;t meant that everyone always got along in a way that people would always hang out together. Work and other things got in the way, particularly when there weren&#39;t things to draw attention. Animalia had lived up Lyre in many ways in that regard. Much of the &quot;small town&quot; vibe remained, but as Animalia bloomed and more people moved into the swelling sister town to Lyre, new attractions and businesses opened to suit it. The club that Ella and Simone ran, Kat&#39;s Klub, was one of those places.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pink and white streamers go well for the decorations, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Simone asked to Ella with a smile as they noted the streamers that hung from hooks mounted on the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; Ella said back politely, &quot;though, I&#39;m more pleased with the party. That people are getting along and... at least for an evening... are able to celebrate love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simone nodded agreement. Their dance floor was full of both Animalians and Humans and they moved to some various bits of romantic music. They didn&#39;t have a band arranged for the night, but the two of them had made sure that their music and stereo system would be able to cover various romantic and love related songs. It was something that fit with Valentines Day, and people were having a good time with it. There were also a few people that were seated at the tables in the side areas away from the main dance floor and enjoying chocolate or other related pieces of candy or treats, the actual makeup of the treats depended on whether or not the people enjoying them were Human or Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think anyone here is new?&quot; Simone asked her partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;New to Lyre/Animalia?&quot; Ella answered, &quot;maybe... maybe not. Most that may have converted on Valentines Day might just be at their hotel enjoying themselves. We&#39;re playing good tunes for people to dance to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, do you want to dance?&quot; Simone asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d never asked,&quot; Ella answered and then pulled her partner along and they actually joined their costumers that were dancing to some soft rock from the 60s. It took Ella a moment or two to get in step, but Simone was right there as they started.</p>
