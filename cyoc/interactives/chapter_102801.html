<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey honey would you mind if I joined you and became a baby too?&quot; Melissa asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I thought you wanted me ta be your babee again&quot; Emily replied looking up at her with a confused expression, &quot;Don&#39;t you wanna take cawe of me mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I want to take care of you my sweet baby girl&quot; Melissa said giving Emily a kiss on the head, &quot;But seeing you as a cute little baby and pooping your diaper brought up so many memories of when you were a real baby. You were so happy and carefree and I want to be able to experience that with you&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybee you just don&#39;t wanna hafta change my dirtee diapees&quot; Emily says with grin before she her thumb in her mouth and started sucking on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the contrary Emily, I want dirty diapers too.  I just want to be the one wearing them and getting them changed&quot; Melissa smirked at the shocked look on Emily&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you want ta wear diapas again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. I&#39;ll admit I was still on the fence about wanting to wear them again when I got here. But after seeing that little girl from earlier wearing them and then you in them just now I couldn&#39;t help feeling a little left out&quot; Melissa admits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh heh mommy&#39;s jealous dat she can&#39;t wear diapas wike me&quot; Emily giggled.<br />
<br />
Melissa blushed bright red at that because what her daughter had just said was true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh I was just pwaying with you mommy, it&#39;s okay if you wanna be a babee too, I don&#39;t mind&quot; Emily said, &quot;And I always kinda wanted a sista to pway with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Emily. I promise to be the best baby sister you never had&quot; Melissa said giving her baby girl another kiss on the head before picking her up from the changing table and setting her down on the floor.<br />
<br />
Melissa then took a step back and concentrated on being 2 years old again. It wasn&#39;t hard as Melissa knew exactly what she looked like when she was a toddler as she and Emily had looked through the family photo album extensively in preparation for this trip. She focused and imagined herself becoming a baby girl like her daughter and smiled when she suddenly lost a foot in height. Melissa&#39;s regression took longer than Emily&#39;s since she was older. It took about a minute for her to go through her 40&#39;s and 30&#39;s which Melissa hardly paid attention to as that was mostly taking care of and raising Emily and she had already relive those memories from watching her regress earlier. Though she did focus on the baby Emily memories as they reminded her of what await at the end of the regression. As she became 28 again she remembered being pregnant with Emily and months later giving birth to her. At 16 she was going to high school and constantly trying to balance hanging with her friends, dating cute boys, and studying for tests. Despite the hassle she got good grades and still managed to have a good time. Melissa continued to grow younger and left her teenage years behind to enter her childhood, becoming 10. She had hit puberty at the same time as Emily but had her first period at home which saved her some embarrassment. As Melissa became age 8 the memories of her waking up in the morning to a wet diaper filled her head. Melissa had also been a bedwetter like Emily, which is probably where she got it from. However she continued to wet the bed and didn&#39;t stop until she was 15. Melissa had been thankful it stopped when it did, otherwise she would have had to explain why she was wearing a diaper to every guy she slept with. Her parents had been very understanding of the whole bedwetting thing, especially her mother who sometimes helped her change out of her wet diapers most mornings. Though she stopped doing it when she entered middle school. The regression started to slow down as Melissa approached 4 and she was now the same eye level as her daughter. A few seconds later she was a 2 year old toddler again and at that age she almost looked like Emily&#39;s twin. The differences between them was that Melissa&#39;s hair was slightly longer and she was a bit shorter. Like her daughter she was wearing a pink shirt, a diaper and pink socks though they were darker in color. Memories from when she was a toddler assaulted her mind; sitting in a highchair as her mother fed her with spoon, drinking warm milk from baby bottles and being burped, lying on the changing table while her mother changed her stinky diapers. Those were her favorite memories as she would always say positive comments to her during the change, like how she was a good baby for using her diaper or praising her when she made a big poopie. Oh, the countless diaper changes she had back then...her mother told her that she would end up going through 6 or 7 diapers in a single day, a fact that Melissa was oddly proud of.<br />
<br />
Breaking out of memory lane for a moment to look at her diaper Melissa grinned as she was happy to finally be wearing one again after so many years.<br />
<br />
Whether it was because of her memories or her newly weak bladder Melissa began to wet herself. However the toddler just giggled as she peed in her diaper, the padding soaking up her accident and becoming puffy as a result.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh heh, I&#39;m going pee pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily just watched with a smile as her mommy went potty, happy that she was finally enjoying herself.<br />
<br />
By the time she was finished peeing her diaper was visibly sagging between her legs and felt a good deal heavier. Instead of being uncomfortable the wet diaper felt warm and comforting and Melissa couldn&#39;t help squeezing the front with her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, if going pee pee feels dis gweat I can&#39;t wait until I go poopy...&quot; Melissa says.</p>
