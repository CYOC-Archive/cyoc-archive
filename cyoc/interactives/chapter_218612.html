<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Krentol for such good chapters! Posting it under my name so people know it&#39;s &#39;official&#39; but it&#39;s all Krentol with some edits from me.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The polar bear lumbered towards Charles, snarling, as the kobold followed listlessly behind.<br />
<br />
Charles readied his dagger.  Palseks may have been a challenge if she could use her magic, but from the dumb look in her eyes it was clear that she was of little threat.  The bigger concern was the polar bear.<br />
<br />
1,500 pounds of pure bear muscle was barreling down on Charles, and all he had to protect himself was a small dagger.  He tried to think out his plan of attack – maybe if he was lucky he could dodge to the side and slash the bear’s neck.  That would kill it, but in this case the “it” wasn’t an enemy, it was Geoffrey.<br />
<br />
Would Finn respawn him?  Charles wasn’t so sure.  At the very least, Finn didn’t appear to have done any favors to Charlon.  But didn’t that also mean that Charles had died too?  And he’d been respawned as…<br />
<br />
Charles looked down at his protruding gut.  Then he began to take a step to the side, only to feel the cheeks of his ass begin to wobble.  He couldn’t think about that now, he needed to deal with the bear, which meant-<br />
<br />
He looked over at his husband Rodrigo who was sitting in the door wide eyed with fear.  For as much as Charles loved him, he was useless in a real fight.<br />
<br />
Then he realized.  Whatever death had led to the creation of Charlon must have also led to the creation of this body, of Charles.  Rodrigo wasn’t his husband, he was just…<br />
<br />
The bear was right on him.  As the bear raised a paw into the air, Charles realized there was no more time for thinking, for now, he had to take action to-<br />
<br />
The bear’s paw swung down and Charles tried to dodge only to find that, for as strong as his body was, all the pudge hanging off his torso killed his dexterity.  He might be able to hit hard, but moving fast just wasn’t something his body could do.  <br />
<br />
As the bear’s paw connected with Charles’ chest, he realized that this must be what Finn had meant about respawning him as something less useful.  Why would a rogue take high strength and low dexterity?  It made no sense.<br />
<br />
Not that anything made sense the moment Charles’ body was knocked to the ground and his head bounced off the cold stone floor.<br />
<br />
When he came to, Charles found himself lying on the floor with something heavy, warm, and furry sitting on his chest.  He tried to speak, only to find that his muzzle was trapped inside something cold, wet, and fishy smelling.  <br />
<br />
Wait a second…was that…?<br />
<br />
Charles opened his eyes and found himself staring at Palsek’s flat, greenscaled chest.  She was sitting on his muzzle, which was pressed deep inside of her, all while she looked down at Charles with a vacant expression on her face.<br />
<br />
Palseks noticed that Charles had come to, and in a robotic voice said, “Master say you make good toy.”<br />
<br />
Charles looked towards the door of the room, hoping that he hadn’t been out for very long and Rodrigo would come running to his rescue.  But unfortunately for Charles, he had no such luck.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo was on his knees in the doorway with Veles and the wolfdog standing in front of him.  Rodrigo clapped his hands together as though praying and said, “please, I’m an alchemist, I can be of great use to you!”<br />
<br />
The wolfdog just laughed, “oh you’ll be of great use alright.  But not to me.”<br />
<br />
Charlon whistled and snapped his fingers towards one of the bulldogs.  Seemingly snapped out of its daze, the bulldog produced a thick, black buttplug and walked over, handing it to Charlon.<br />
<br />
Charlon, in turn, handed the buttplug to Veles and gave a simple command, “Veles, tailor him.”<br />
<br />
Veles spoke the words, then tossed the buttplug aside.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing seemed to happen, and Rodrigo took that as his opportunity to beg.<br />
<br />
“Please!” he said, “I don-“<br />
<br />
But his plea was cut off as his mouth sealed shut.  His skin grew darker and shinier, until it was indistinguishable from the rubber of a cheap sextoy.  Then his arms and legs shrank away, his head smoothed over, and before long, all that was left lying on the ground was an overly girthy buttplug.<br />
<br />
Picking it up, Charlon said, “I don’t know if you can hear me in there, but like I said, you won’t be useful to me.  Veles, however, will need some stretching before he’s suitable for me to use, and I’m sure you’ll be quite useful to him in that regard.”<br />
<br />
Then the wolfdog turned to Charles.<br />
<br />
“What to do about you…”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm!” Charles tried to shout, only to find his pleas for mercy muffled by Palsek’s cold, moist cunt.<br />
<br />
“It looks like you’re enjoying yourself in there,” Charlon giggled, “Veles, why don’t you make him a bit more to my slave’s liking.”<br />
<br />
Charles watched as Veles walked over to him.  And while he knew the futility of it, he couldn’t help but make the most pleading expression possible.<br />
<br />
“Tailor.” Veles said in a flat, emotionless voice.<br />
<br />
Dragonfucker found itself staring up at its owner.  It felt its bones turn soft and flexible as the tough mineral warped into flexible latex.  Fur faded into non-existence as a red scaled pattern formed into its squishy skin.<br />
<br />
It tried to move only to find that it no longer had muscles.  Its entire body was just a solid latex torso attached to a solid latex head, but that was soon to change.<br />
<br />
Its head began to merge with its muzzle, forming a smooth, tapered tip.  It sank deeper and deeper into the kobold that owned it, watching as its vision got closer and closer to her scaley cunt, before being sucked inside a sea of moist blackness.<br />
<br />
Its torso narrowed as it merged into its former head, all while the dragonfucker felt is asshole desperately trying to clench.  For a moment, the dragonfucker almost thought that its asshole might be trying to tear itself free of its body and get away, but as dragonfucker sank even deeper into its master’s depths, it felt its base rotate until its asshole was pressed into the floor.<br />
<br />
That didn’t stop the dragonfucker’s asshole from clenching, and it soon clenched down on the stone beneath, sucking down and finishing the dragonfucker’s transformation as the once fleshy asshole converted into a plastic sucked cup.<br />
<br />
Now rooted to the ground, it heard a voice call out, “now put your toy to use.”<br />
<br />
Its master began gyrating on top of it, and it could feel her insides gripping down, massaging the length of its body in damp need.<br />
<br />
It felt so good to be inside of master.  So good for her to run her body up and down its own.  So good to be twisted and squeezed.  To feel her cold juices penetrating into its porous surface.<br />
<br />
And then there was a pop, and the gyrating stopped, though Charlie still found himself wedged deep into Palsek’s cunt.<br />
<br />
“What is Palseks doing?” came a booming voice from above.<br />
<br />
“What does it looked like?” was the muffled reply.<br />
<br />
“Finn, what did you-?” <br />
<br />
“You lost Paul, or should I say Palseks.”<br />
<br />
Charlie the faint sound of a bear roar and a fox yip.<br />
<br />
“Be thankful I let you keep a sapient body, I could have turned you into an animal like your friends, or a toy like poor Charlie there.”<br />
<br />
It was then that Charlie felt Palseks slowly lift herself off of him, and as her cunt cleared his tip, he found himself staring up at the dripping slit that was the kobold’s ‘new’ cunt.<br />
<br />
Charlie was forced to watch as Palseks took a step back and looked down, straight into the source of Charlie’s vision.<br />
<br />
“That…”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Palseks, that’s Charlie,” came Finn’s voice from somewhere in the distance.<br />
<br />
Palseks reached down and touched Charlie’s tip, applying the slightest amount of pressure in the process and causing Charlie’s body to bounce back and forth slightly.  As his vision ping ponged around the room, he caught the briefest sight of a massive red dragon sitting in the midst of a vast treasure room.<br />
<br />
“So, what to do.  What to do.” Finn mused.<br />
<br />
“You seem like you would make a good maid Palseks, what do you say?  As for Greg, he should suffice as your cleaning rag.  And my menagerie could use a bear and a fox.”<br />
<br />
Then a shadow passed over Charlie as a massive, draconic head came into view, blocking his vision of anything else.  Finn looked down at him, and Charlie looked up into two eyes that glowed like magma.<br />
<br />
“As for you, I wouldn’t want Palseks to get bored.”<br />
<br />
Finn let out a loud chuckle and smoke billowed out of his nose, blasting Charlie with a sudden wave of intense heat.<br />
<br />
“Or, perhaps I could just send all of you to-&quot;<br />
