<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A close call for Leslie is now done and as she sleeps soundly Jane shuffles the many pages of notes together. <br />
<br />
Looking out the rear window Jane does not see the Bull George. A frantic bit of looking proves the beast is gone. Quickly jane dashes out the rear door to stand upon the deck and even calls out his name. Then she walked down the steps to stand upon the well grazed backyard, the signs of the Bull being there lays about in soft steaming heaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gate!&quot; Thinks Jane as she seeing the open gate and walks over to peer out at the big wide world.<br />
<br />
Not a sign of the big Bull except another pile of his leavings near the roadside where he maybe had to wait for traffic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Odd!&quot; Jane thought as a common animal especially a bull would just walk out into the street not understanding the injury or hurt it might encumber from being struck by a car. Yet George must retain some of his human learned memories as he waited to cross the road as demarked by his pile of manure where he stood.<br />
<br />
Now it was Jane's duties to care for Leslie as she would for the next couple of months be going through some awkward changes as the body fights to retain the original patterns. As then Jane thought of the wonderous possible profits this Radical Thyroid formula was to bring for the company. She now realized it well that this was not the correct doseages and it would need some tone down of the basic properties, or others would share the fate of George, Marsha, Stan, Kyle, and the others.<br />
<br />
Once inside the house of Leslie's Jane took up cleaning the mess which two sexually disturbed people had made. An occasional look toward Leslie made Jane smile as she was snoring like a trooper.<br />
<br />
The downstairs was tiddied up in short order, as then Jane made her way upstairs to the bedroom and its mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy molely!&quot; Thought Jane as she saw a bed covered in dried crustly stains of what was highly infectious Bovine semen. The floor was plastered in dried knobby chunks which were stuck to the hardwood floor like glue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy they had a damn orgy up here!&quot; Again thought Jane of the horrid mess.<br />
<br />
Using great care as not to become infected herself Jane took two pillowcases and wrapped her hands and arms, this as protection from direct contact. Then gathering the sheets and blankets off the bed Jane walked them down to the basement laundry.<br />
<br />
Finding some heavy laytex type of gloves and drawing a sculding hot pail of water, Jane let the washing machine do its work as she headed upstairs to clean and mop.<br />
<br />
On her knees Jane scrubbed the floor trying her best not to even breathe the rank scents coming off the softening globs of George's infected semen.<br />
<br />
Pail after pail of sour infected juices and yellow colored semen were dumped down the toilet as Jane continued to clean. As with each bucket she sneezed often, the smell tickling her nose. <br />
<br />
It had been hours of backbreaking work but the place looked and smelled quite clean. Jane looked around knowing that even one remaining fleck of George's semen could send Leslie to a premanant life time as some beefy cow.<br />
<br />
A scream from downstairs had Jane flying down to check on Leslie!<br />
<br />
Even to Jane as she walked into the room Leslie's dark silhouette as she stood looking out the window suggested a monsterous form indeed.<br />
<br />
Crying and balling her eyes out Leslie stood there not in anguish for her changed strange form, but she was weeping as George was not in the backyard.<br />
<br />
As Jane stood there eyes wide looking at the dark side of Leslie's shape it was going to take quite a while to revert her totally back to human.<br />
<br />
Head waggling as she cried, three fingered hands with half born hooves wiped tears fromher puffed up bovine shaped cheeks.<br />
<br />
Shoulders like those of a Green Bay Packer Lineman, her neck thick of muscle if just to hold the heavy squared boney head of her alomst bovined' self.<br />
<br />
Thos broad hips and wide thighs making a real sight! She looked much more as a cow there, her long boney tail swishing with either a move of her hips, or the urge to swing the monster. Even below her thighs the legs had begun to assume the bone structure of a boive hind leg. Leslie's heels were more as a hock, while feet now long aided her haunched stance when being upright.<br />
<br />
The pondering wonder of how leslie's cloven hind hooves would ever soften and become five human toes again? Indeed, even as Jane stood there thinking her concern was that Leslie was closer to being a cow than becoming a real human.<br />
<br />
Leslie peered out the window, her eyes and face contorted with every sob. She placed her cloven hands on the window sash and being so intent of where George had gone she was soon whipping her tail about in frantic or paranoiac frame of mind.<br />
<br />
These actions concerned Jane the most as it would seem Leslie was wishing to be the cow and not return to her human life or form.<br />
<br />
A distant sound of Police sirens suggested maybe to both Leslie and Jane of an accident involving some vehicle and a wandering bull.<br />
<br />
In a fast dash Leslie bolted for the back door.<br />
<br />
Jane rushed after Leslie but before she reached her friend the obvious peril was known by both. The door was closed and its bolt lock slammed shut.<br />
<br />
Try as she might Leslie could not conform her changed half hoove hands to turn the key lock or twist the knob. A frantic look on her half changed face told much of her inner panic and desires.<br />
<br />
Jane stood there watching and learning just what animal lust could cause and once tried then took absolute final hold on the person. The welling tears in Leslie's eyes, her shaking all over as if a panic struck animal in heat, all this a much more told Jane of Leslie's mindset.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really would wish to join George, to become his cow and live a short life being an animal, am I right?&quot; asked Jane.<br />
<br />
Leslie looked directly at Jane her big brown round cow eyes seeing and looking deep into her friend's face. She held up her half changed hands, turned to peer over a shoulder at one cow's tail, and then looking back at Jane gave a slow nod.<br />
<br />
Jane walked backwards a few steps and then plopped down against the back of a chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;My dear friend, I want you to spend a night and the next day thinking over this before we doom you to such a life. I will remain here and we might confer together, but this needs time to think and be sure!&quot; suggested Jane.<br />
<br />
Even as she suggested the time to think, Leslie had one cloven hand behind her butt massaging her multifolds of fleshy sex.</p>
