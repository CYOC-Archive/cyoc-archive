<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With ideas flowing through his head, an idea sparked in Dillon&#39;s mind. &#39;If mythical creatures don&#39;t exist, I can just conjure them into reality in a way. In fact, why stop there? Why not to myths merged together?&#39; Dillon figured out a unique way to change his mom, a pegasus centaur. &quot;Let&#39;s see, what color do you think suit this place best?&quot; Dillon was caught off guard by the question. &quot;I... Blue? Maybe? I don&#39;t know.&quot; Dillon&#39;s tail suddenly changed from green, to a deep blue. His mom took a look. &quot;Hm... Maybe not such a dark blue like that.&quot; Dillon was confused until he saw his mom pointing at his tail. He hadn&#39;t noticed it changed color. &quot;Maybe a lighter shade...&quot; Dillon took that to mind as his tail turned from a deep blue to a sky blue. &quot;There! That&#39;s a welcoming color!&quot; His mom started to take notes as Dillon stood there slightly confused. It&#39;s going to be hard to pay attention to his mom&#39;s antics while she goes through the change, but he figured he can probably pay attention to her.<br />
<br />
Before she asked any more questions, Dillon spoke quietly in the ring. &quot;Mom will become a pegasus centaur completely with an equine shaped face, a long horn on her forehead and pure white wings on her horse back. She will acknowledge the changes, but not be bothered by them.&quot; He whispered. &quot;Now I&#39;m not against leather furniture, bit I don&#39;t think that will complement the new room color.&quot; Dillon looked towards his mom as the ring glowed. She briefly looked over at Dillon to see his hands behind his back. &quot;I&#39;m thinking beige. That will help the place glow a bit.&quot; She says almost as if she saw the glow from his ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s check the kitchen.&quot; She says walking along to the kitchen side of the room. Dillon couldn&#39;t help but notice his moms legs seem to be getting thicker. In fact, she saw it herself. &quot;Oh, this is peculiar.&quot; She says as a small bump appears to protrude from her forehead. &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot; She says as her face starts stretching ever so slowly and her bangs start turning from blonde to a radiant silver. Dillon watches carefully while trying to listen to her as she changes. No sooner, a long white horn about 6 inches long grew out her forehead as her face stretched outward longer and her nostrils started to flare up. Over the next few minutes, her legs got so thick, her jeans started to shred by her ankles. She nearly tripped out of her heels as her toes start hardening and fusing together into silver cloven hooves showing beautiful white hair spreading upward her legs. &quot;She managed to grab on to a counter before she hit the floor. &quot;Whew. Close one.&quot; Dillon rushed over to assist her. &quot;Are you able to walk?&quot; He asked. &quot;Just assist me for a minute. I might be able to soon. Lead me to the bathroom.&quot; Dillon complied as they steadily walked towards the bathroom. Dillon looked over to notice his mom&#39;s nose and mouth fully stretched out into an equine muzzle with her skin on her nose and mouth turning white.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the bathroom, Dillon&#39;s mom continued with her evaluation as her jeans were about to give out completely. During her rambling, two nubs formed at her waist that extended out with the same white hair growing around her legs. &quot;Ow! here come the joint pains...&quot; She said painfully as the two nubs extended gradually extended out until they were as long as her hoof legs. Her new legs made bone cracking sounds as new joints helped them bend downward. &quot;Okay. I think it&#39;s- Oh!&quot; With a surprise yelp, her jeans couldn&#39;t take the pressure anymore as her pants burst open revealing the whit hair spread all around her legs up to her waste. Her front hooves placed flat on the tiled floor as she slowly regained balance. &quot;Thanks for the help, but I think I can stand now.&quot; She pushes Dillon away and while a bit wobbly, she was walking. &quot;Right. Now the bedroom. Hope you&#39;ve had time to tidey up.&quot; She says getting more comfortable walking on four legs. Dillon noticed while exiting the bathroom that in between her four legs, her body seemed to be extending outward, basically making it a separate barrel shaped torso. Dillon followed watching the front and back legs spread wider apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here we... Eh... A bit messy don&#39;t you think?&quot; Dillon sighed at his mom&#39;s comment. &quot;I was getting dressed before you got here.&quot; He said referring to the sea of clothes scattered all around his room. &quot;Even with clothes that don&#39;t fit? I&#39;ve haven&#39;t seen you wear large size shirts since you were 10.&quot; She refered to the torn t-shirt and jeans on the floor. Dillon wondered what exactly she remembers with her mind being altered by the ring. Needless to say, it must&#39;ve been interesting if she thinks 10 year olds wear large. Dillon was about to comment when he noticed his mom&#39;s pegasus torso had not only fully grown, but packed in some muscle within her equine legs. She&#39;d give the big stallions a run for their money. &quot;Well, we&#39;re not here to talk about that obviously. Let&#39;s get to business.&quot; She says turning around to show her well toned horse ass. Not before Dillon noticed sprouting hairs from her rear, as a long silver tail lashed out her behind. Her tail wasn&#39;t much of a horse, but almost more resembled a lions, noting it&#39;s length and the tassel of silver hair on the tip. The changes were nearly complete and Dillon&#39;s mom had seemed to grow accustomed to her new legs as she trotted around the room so elegantly. As she took more notes, Dillon noticed her hair turning from a dark blonde to a radiant silver as the color has taken over her hair as a whole. Her ears weren&#39;t visible from her long hair before, but Dillon saw that two long pointed ears the same color as her hair were starting to poke out from the top of her head. She continues her examination while the same silver hair started to grow alongside her human back down to the base of her horse body to give her a flowing mane. &quot;Well, I think that&#39;s everything. I&#39;ll give you my notes back in the living room.&quot; She says trotting out Dillon&#39;s bedroom with her tail swishing behind her. Dillon was astonished, but satisfied with how everything went. He considered his mom attractive as much as a single mother with a child could be, but now he considered her absolutely beautiful. And the changes weren&#39;t even finished.<br />
<br />
Dillon rejoined his mom in the living room as she read through her notes. &quot;Right. Everything should be accounted for. I&#39;ll leave you with this. I know you&#39;re not exactly planning a budget, so do what you can whenever you can.&quot; His mom handed him a sheet of notes she took during the tour. Dillon took them and looked up to thank her, only to see the final changes commence. Her forearms had grown a significant amount of muscles, as well as her chest swelling to D cup breasts barely contained by her tank top, her stomach reforming to six pack abs, and her neck thinking in general. She was nowhere as muscular as Dillon, but she was definitely ripped. Dillon tried to contain his excitement by curling his tail in a tight grip before he finally let a word out. &quot;Right... Thanks mom. I appreciate the advice.&quot; Dillon sheepishly smiled. His mom&#39;s equine face sported a wide genuine smile as she put her arms around Dillon&#39;s thick neck and nuzzled his face with her nose. &quot;Oh Dillon. I know I only came to visit, but it makes me so happy to see you doing okay in the world. I just want you to know, I&#39;ve started dating again, and I think I&#39;ve found a good candidate for your new stepfather.&quot; Dillon was caught off guard by his mom&#39;s words. Before moving out, she had said she wanted to focus on herself before commiting to any relationship. He&#39;d only been gone for about a year. &quot;Wow. Well, I&#39;m happy for you.&quot; Dillon said as his tail changed to a bright yellow indicating his happiness for her while slightly wagging it. His mom let out a chuckle. &quot;I see that. I wasn&#39;t so sure it&#39;d work out because of the difference in species, but I made a decision, and I have yet to regret it.&quot; Dillon than began to embrace himself for a hug from his beautiful pegasus mother. &quot;Well, sorry to dump personal things upon you. I gotta get back home. I love you honey.&quot; She said kissing Dillon&#39;s forehead. &quot;Love you too mom. You uh, need help with the air fare?&quot; Dillon asked. His mother laughed hysterically at his offer. &quot;Oh you always were the funny one weren&#39;t you? Thanks, but I think I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Dillon only stared in confusion as his mom trotted out the front door. He was just about to confront her before she leaped off the balcony and large glowing white wings sprawled from her equine back leaving Dillon bewildered, but also embarrassed. &quot;Duh. She&#39;s a pegasus. She can fly herself.&quot; Dillon facepalmed. He watched his mother fly into the sky before her trail of light disappeared along with her.<br />
<br />
Coming back into his apartment, Dillon had to register everything he&#39;d gone through with his mom. It was honestly the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. His heart beated like a train going full speed. &quot;I can&#39;t believe everything I could ever ask for is in this ring.&quot; He stared at the rainbow jewel inside with envy, only thinking about what he could possibly do next.</p>
