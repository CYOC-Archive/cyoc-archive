<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To be fair, you knew from the moment you got here where the first place you were going to take Jane. After all, she was the reason you decided to come here. To be frank, you did your homework. The weird magic and the fact that basically no one ever notices when they or anything else changes because of this place. And of all the things the place offered, the one that was posted everywhere you looked was...<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we get a nice, relaxing massage? I hear they have a great place here on the Island. I think it&#39;s called... Paradise Oasis?&quot; You smiled, giving her a slight shrug. That was the name of the place all right. Hell, even if you didn&#39;t know about what they did to their customers, you&#39;d probably gone there yourself anyway just because of the name. It sounded fancy, but cool enough to attract attention of the common-man. <br />
<br />
Just from Jane&#39;s reaction, you could tell what her answer was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, yes! That sounds soooooo nice right now!&quot; She bounced in place for a moment, almost looking like a child told they were going to the toy store. And they say money can&#39;t buy happiness? Obviously, it can when you put some thought into it. Before you can really get a chance to reply, Jane already grabbed you by the hand and was dragging you out of them and back towards the elevator, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go! Then, we can catch show at the theater after or go down to the beach or- Ah! I&#39;m so excited!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Not as excited as your gonna be,&#39; you chuckled to yourself a bit. This was your gift to her, for putting up with all your crap for four long years of dating. All the ups and downs, the laughs and the tears, this was your way of saying &quot;I love you&quot; and giving her what she always wanted: her fantasy.<br />
<br />
With the pamphlet still in hand, the two of you made your way down the central street of Pleasure Island nicknamed Mane Street. Huh, punny.  Honestly you couldn&#39;t help but to laugh a little anyway, especially since Jane was giggling when she pointed out it.<br />
<br />
As the two of you walked around, you noticed just how dense and diverse the staff and customers here were. From all walks of life and all shapes and sizes. Jane gushed over a few &#39;costumed&#39; employees having some of the best looking furry suits she&#39;d ever seen. Of course, you knew better, but didn&#39;t want to ruin the surprise that was waiting for her. Despite the few drivers here and there, almost everyone walked around too. Maybe there was just a rule about it? Either way, you couldn&#39;t help but notice that you haven&#39;t seen a single person yet that didn&#39;t look they were having the time of the life. This place really was turning out to be something. It... was kind of infectious, honestly.<br />
<br />
After all, you were here for Jane, yet now you were starting to get just as excited as she was. Hm, maybe it was a connect high or something? Oh well, not that it mattered. You were on a island in the middle of nowhere called Pleasure Island. Might as well enjoy yourself and a year&#39;s salary.<br />
<br />
After about half an hour of walking, you finally reached the place; Paradise Oasis. To be honest, it looked more like a Egyptian bathhouse for the Pharaohs than a actual spa. Or maybe a temple where the people of old would worship the long forgotten gods. You almost wanted to just admire the beautiful building itself. It&#39;s golden hue, the craving on the pillars, the statues that looked like they were robbed right from a museum... almost. But your better half- Jane in this case- snapped you out of it by dragging you inside it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on come on come on! This place looks so- wow...&quot; She paused the moment the two of you were in, looking around at stone cut rooms and ceiling, the tapestry that lined the back of the receptionist desk and marvelous paints that almost looked to be carved right into the walls. And all lit with only candles and incenses lightly burning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about commitment...&quot; You mutter aloud before Jane suddenly squeaks with surprise. You quickly draw your attention to her to see she was looking at now waiting person that stood before you. Or rather... they weren&#39;t a person at all.<br />
<br />
There was a jackel woman standing before you to in a simple white robe with golden sash and ankh necklace. Everything about was... was... flawless. Her midnight black fur to the golden makeup around her eyes and ears. It was hard not to feel your voice draw back in shock before such a beautiful creature. Then, she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome, to our Oasis,&quot; the jackal spoke with such gentle tone,  any doubts you might have left about the place vanished then and there. Jane, on the other hand, as far more taken back.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-How... How did you get the mouth to work like that?&quot; She asked, reaching up to touch the jackal&#39;s snout, &quot;I mean, is it like an animatronic or-&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could finish, the jackal woman reached up to hold Jane&#39;s hand, instantly silencing her. You could tell just by the look on her face what she was thinking. This... was real. No smoke or mirrors this time. This really was a jackal in the flesh speaking to them.<br />
<br />
She then turned her attention to you with a smile, &quot;Your mate is rather a curious one. I can already tell why you chose to bring her here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t too sure how to take that, but ended up nodding in agreement. How could you not when her speaking voice was a smooth as silk and sweet as honey?<br />
<br />
&quot;You are in luck. I am not busy,&quot; the jackal smiled, now back to Jane, &quot;And I can see what you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how much do we owe yo-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Pleasure Island,&quot; the jackal cut you off, &quot;the fact you are here is payment enough.&quot; With a nearly all too perfect gesture, she started to guide Jane away from you, &quot;Sir, you are a little more tricky to read, but fear not. I will send my dear friend take care of you~&quot;<br />
<br />
That honestly took you by surprise. You weren&#39;t here to have anything done, this was for Jane! Before you could say anything, your loving girlfriend rushes back over and plants a kiss on your lips. Hugging you tightly for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you thank you thank you...&quot; She cuddled into your arms. Great, how were you suppose to deny anything now? This was... clearly something she wanted for the both of you now. Wasn&#39;t it? For only a second, you feel a little light headed, but it passes as quickly as it came.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; you manage a small reply. Jane looks up at you excitedly before the jackal woman pulls her away once more with a soft giggle of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do love to see such pure young lovers in bloom,&quot; she speaks in a nearly poetic way, &quot;And soon, you two shall be more in love than ever before. I shall take great care to assure this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Miss!&quot; Jane replied with a bounce in her step as she followed closely behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it. My friend shall be with your mate before you know it~&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that, they left you standing there, almost agape. Even watching them as they left you stand alone, it was hard not admire the two. Your mind was racing with new thoughts and ideas of what was going to happen next and each one just furthered your now growing excitement. In fact, it was a little hard to stand without a certain member on your person standing at full salute.<br />
<br />
Blushing faintly, you look around for moment to see a wonderfully decorated couch nearby. What luck, you think. So much so that the realization of something obvious escaped you. Despite this building being so big, and so many people praising it as a life changing experience... you were the only one waiting. And when that finally dawned you, a shiver ran down your spine.<br />
<br />
... Why were you the only one waiting? Sure, you watched a few other beautiful creatures walked about from place to place and the adorable feline working behind the counter for God only knows what would flash you toothy smile from time to time, where were all the other patrons? Was this just a slow day? Something just felt a little off.<br />
<br />
Something you couldn&#39;t really place.</p>
