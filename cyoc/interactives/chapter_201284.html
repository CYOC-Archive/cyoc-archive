<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas was fed up! He&#39;d spent his whole summer studying and working out and only one of them was paying off. His grades were the highest in his year, but no matter how much he worked out, he just couldn&#39;t move out of the tall, slim, defined but unimpressive phase.<br />
<br />
Lucas was your typical nerd, into programming, painting models of fantasy armies, watching star trek, if it was niche and nerdy he loved it. This meant two things, he rarely could make friends and the more jock-like guys at school saw him as an easy target!<br />
<br />
To make things worse for him, he was also gay and still in the closet. Terrified if the bullies found out they&#39;d be calling him a fag even more than they already do.<br />
<br />
Lucas came from a pretty standard nuclear family, both parents, an older sister (18) and him (15). He dad was some big shot sales person, he never paid enough attention to whatever it was he sold, but he was apparently very successful at it. His dad said it was down to three things, when he managed to get a lecture in at the dinner table, always aimed at his son, who he was less than impressed with how he was turning out. David had been a soccer player, fit and toned, good-looking, all the girls wanted a date with him, his blonde locks a big hit with the many girls he did date. He hadn&#39;t changed that much since then, still taking great care in his appearance and religious in checking that he wasn&#39;t getting a dreaded dad bod!<br />
<br />
&quot;First impressions, appearance and charm&quot;. He said pointing his knife at his son giving the same lecture he&#39;d heard a thousand times. &quot;You need to work on how you present yourself son, you&#39;re too shy and meek, you need to stick out that hand and give the world a firm handshake once in a while!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, leave him alone, Lucas is fine just how he is.&quot; His mother kindly offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mom.&quot; Lucas muttered. His mother was always his protector, ever since he was little she&#39;d defend him whenever his father made a comment about how weak or how femme he was being. She knew deep down her boy liked other boys and when he was ready she&#39;d hug him and tell him she loved him and hoped he would bring home a nice boy for dinner one night (yes she&#39;d thought through how it would go, even going so far as to think about what kind of boys her son would like, she decided they&#39;d probably be quite feminine and petite). Angie and David got married when they were both 19, had their eldest daughter (Nicola) at 18 (these ages don&#39;t line up but that&#39;s how a broken condom can lead to happy accidents!).<br />
<br />
Lucas took after his mother physically, he was slim like her, dark hair, dark eyes. Nicola took after her father, blonde, tall, into sports and physically very fit. She played for the local Volleyball team and had already been approached to join the country team for some games or something. She was nice enough to Lucas, though they rarely spoke to be honest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I be excused? I have a new book I want to start reading.&quot; Lucas asked standing before permission was given. His dad grunted approval and kept on eating.<br />
<br />
Getting up to his room Lucas lay on his bed and pulled out the book he&#39;d gotten from the library and opened it up. It was called &quot;The Universe&quot; and it was... blank. Flicking through the pages it looked like they were all blank...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s some kind of journal or something?&quot; Lucas said aloud &quot;Well if could, like, at least show some space stats in the corners or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he kept flicking he saw dark shapes appear around the edges of each page. He paused on a page and watched it swirl into text.<br />
<br />
&#39;The Horsehead Nebula is small dark nebula in the constellation Orion.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah&quot; Lucas said jumping up and away from the book. Had it just... shown him what he asked to see?<br />
<br />
He leaned back slowly, timidly and gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next page will show me....&quot; Lucas thought &quot;um, stats on star sizes for known stars...&quot;<br />
<br />
He gingerly, hand shaking, turned the page. And there was a table and text, all about stars. Size, energy output, brightness, age and so on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... wow.&quot; Lucas sat thinking for a long time, staring at the book lying innocently on his bed. He wanted to see if the book was stuck to one <br />
subject, in his mind Universe meant space... but it meant everything.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath. &quot;The next page will show me who in my school is gay.&quot; He whispered. He turned the page.<br />
<br />
His school was huge but the list of names was sadly very short. Out of 900 or so students only 14 were gay! And 12 of those were girls!<br />
<br />
It just listed Lucas Rushton and some other kid called Ian Butcher. Who the hell was Ian Butcher? He pulled out his phone and googled. Ian was some random kid in the year below him, covered in acne, pudgy build, bright ginger hair and buck teeth and he seemed to be obsessed with something called EXO. (Lucas later found out this was a Korean boy band). Lucas felt a pang of sorrow for him. He looked like he had a lot of things going against him already. He felt bad for him being gay as well, in Lucas&#39;s mind that was another rock for him to shoulder. So he grabbed a pencil and crossed out Ian&#39;s name from the list.<br />
<br />
He watched as Ian&#39;s name dissolved into nothing. &quot;What... it changed... oh god... what?&quot; He swung back to his mobile and re-googled. Panting with relief he saw Ian was still there, only this time he seemed to be into something called BLACKPINK (A Korean girl group).<br />
<br />
Lucas sat shaking looking at his phone in one hand, his pencil in the other and the book lying on his bed in front of him... He changed reality, he changed what was to what he wanted it to be...<br />
<br />
He dropped the pencil and closed the book again, lying back on his bed he began to try to calm down and think. An hour later he was fast asleep and dreaming.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
In his dream he was powerful, he was in charge, people knew he was in charge, he was on top. He looked outward and saw himself sat on a throne, with two muscular guys on either side, one with a thin, shining golden chain around his neck leading to Lucas’s left hand, and one with a black spiky chain that looked covered in black soot, around the neck of the second guy leading to his right hand. Lucas noted he looked the same… except for the bulge in his trousers, that both guys kept looking at hungrily.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Lucas jolted awake, his trousers tented with his small boner (only 3.9 inches, he’d measured it more than once hoping it would grow.) Looking down he saw the book on the end of his bed. Still horny and maybe a quarter asleep, and definitely a little crazed with power. He opened to a now empty page, gripped his pencil and wrote.<br />
<br />
Nerdy guys like me are super hung, dominant tops! Our cocks make jocks want to serve us and eventually worship our cocks. Every guy like me gets two guys that eventually become totally devoted to them. One is a mean jock, one is a sweet jock. Eventually they become a throuple and live happily ever after!<br />
<br />
Slamming the pencil down hard he sat and stared at the text. It solidified and turned from handwriting to printed text. It stood out against the white page for a moment or two and then faded back into the paper into nothingness.<br />
<br />
Lucas was holding his breath and finally exhaled. Hmm… did it not work.<br />
<br />
He went to stand up and stopped sat on the edge of the bed. A very unfamiliar weight was pulling at him. Specifically from his groin area. Looking down he saw a huge bulge between his thin thighs, his trousers had clearly been let out in this area but the feeling of weight was still alien and weird for him.<br />
<br />
His hand shaking he reached for the zip and slowly lowered it. The black shiny silk boxers he was now wearing were bulging with flesh. He lowered his trousers and then reached out tentatively and touched the… thing. It was warm, soft yet firm and he felt himself touching it, it was definitely attached to him. And the attention was seeming to make it shift and grow.<br />
<br />
He quickly grabbed his waistband and yanked downwards. A cock of mammoth proportions (to him) unfurled and drooped out in front of him. It pulled at his groin, but it seemed his legs, abs and waist were used to the weight and it felt… natural.<br />
<br />
He reached over to his dresser and grabbed the tape measure (yes he kept it there… living in hope it would grow one time and it seems at last it did). He was semi hard but he didn’t care he had to know. He placed one end at the base and draped the rest over his cock and gripped where the head of his, frankly beautiful cock, ended. Pulling the tape up to look he could have fainted. Semi-hard he was 9 inches!<br />
<br />
He sat back down on the bed with a thud, his cock slapping his thighs satisfyingly.<br />
<br />
Now what? He wondered.</p>
