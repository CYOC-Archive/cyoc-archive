<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The World around Ty was moving relatively smoothly, the city of Adrianople was currently suffering no devastation, (but a slight sense of being unconciously raped) and the Anthro's were widely inactive. Ty placed things this way to allow the world around him to run while he sat back and considered his role in the Herms story.<br />
&quot;First thing I ought to consider is just what role i'm going to take in this story.&quot; he said quietly to himself. His thoughts wandered for a minute or two before he settled on the idea of being an Anthro, but not a giant one. Mabye just above norml human height.<br />
Ty stood up, and allowed himself to grow a couple more inches until he reached the height of six-and-a-half feet.<br />
&quot;Good. Now what kind of animal ought i to be?&quot;<br />
He thought for a moment, and began muttering to himself again.<br />
&quot;I gotta be something unique, something no ones ever thought of being before...&quot; he began to pace around the room, which he had changed a moment before. it now resembled somwhat the master bedroom of one of his previous foster parents. These ones were rich, and paid even less attention to him than Mark or June ever had. It was spacious, pentagon-shaped, and had a very elagent bed in its center. Built for two people of course, but capable of accomadating seven. In one corner was the master beth, where Ty had never seen the inside of, so he had to make it up once he had to use it.<br />
&quot;A Dinosaur.&quot; Ty smiled. &quot;A Tyrannosaur, yeah, that would suit me well. But then...&quot; he still liked the concept of being able to fly, which was not something most of the T-Rex's known to humankind couldn't do. Ty's smile widened as another Idea dawned on him.<br />
&quot;A Dragon.&quot; his smile turned into a grin. &quot;A tall, strong, and sexy Gold-Scaled Dragon Anthro. That's what I want to be.&quot;<br />
Immediatly, Ty felt his body shift. His skin became rough, adn another look downward made him understand. His skin was gone, and was replaced by scales. A slightly horse-like and yet lizard-like snout hung between his eyes, his very large eyes, and his black bangs dropped out in ont of his sight. Ty swished his new tongue around in his mouth and grinned, revealing two rows of razor-sharp teeth, then flexed his strong wings. his tail swished frm side to side happily, as he paced the room, examining his new claws. His clothes he commanded to stay on, despite whatever changes may occur, and as he stared at himself in the mirror, he noted just how awesome he really looked. He also noticed that his chest, abs, and undertail were all soft and black, which he admired, but didn't exactly intend to gain.<br />
&quot;How wierd.&quot; he thought. This is interesting. But with other thoughts on his mind, Ty turned and observed his back and wings.<br />
He still had an unfortunate scrawnyness, compared to the other Anthro's bodies, although the extra height did give his abs and pecs some extra definition. but still, he thought, I'd be more comfortable with more.<br />
He removed his T-shirt quickly, and stared for one moment at his image. Then, deciding it may be a much better idea, he stripped off the rest of his clothing. He noted the fact that he still had a nine-inch soft member between his legs, with two orange-sized testes behind them. Anyway, he spread out his scaley legs, and stretched out his arms, focusing solely on the mirror. Ty had an Image in his mind for what he wanted to look like, not as huge as Anton, but relatively more muscular than Lorenzo. He shut his eyes and focused on this image, and smile when he felt trhe transition. He opened his big eyes, and saw his new body, but with the build of an intermediate bodybuilder. he tilted his head slightly, then added a few more pounds. That's it. That was just how he ought to look. Nice muscular body, biggest member in history, and a very attractive weredragon body. He snarled animalistically, and flexed his wings, enjoying the sweet little world he was creating for himself. He bent his two arms up to place a double-bicep shot, and found them to match the size of two grapefruits. Man he was hot.<br />
<br />
To his enjoyment, he felt his cock begin to harden, and with the new size and potential sexual strength, he felt the first pangs of pleasure he usually felt just before and orgasm. This made his cock ache for more, and it continued its acsent. Twelve inches of a slick, smooth-scaled pitch-black penis the girth of a beer can swayed before him, and Ty's breathing was starting to escalate. What was coursing through him now was a feeling he only remembered in brief moments when he climaxed, but now he was feeling it go on and on, taking place of only the pleasure of letting loose a great glob of precum which dangled playfully to the floor. Fifteen inches now extended from his crotch, and precum spewed out with a foce equal to his former orgasms. Ty gasped and panted with the mounting pleasure that radiated from his swollen member, and almost collapsed onto the floor, if it had not been for his quick reflexes. He lay on his back in the middle of the bedroom, with more and more hot semen spraying fiercly from his apricot-sized cocks head. <br />
Ty was fully hard now, with eighteen inches of rock solid dragon meat and the thickness of a wine bottle. He moaned and growled, never having experianced such mind-blowing bliss before, and with great effort, he lifted his head to stare at his new genitals, and his maw opened in a wide smile.<br />
His cock was wine-bottle thick, twenty-four inches long, jet black, and covered in thick, twitching veins. He remembered that with Anthro's, sometimes their testicles would grow in size along with the cock, and did they ever. Two enormous vein-wringed cantaloupes met his gaze, and  at last, throwing his head back, he roared with extacy, as the precum struck the cieling in a pre-climax shot, and with a jerk from his crotch, Ty's mind was taken from him, and he was filled with the world-shattering sensation of having blown a whole Pint of sticky, steaming-hot semen onto the roof with his great organic weapon.<br />
<br />
Ty felt his body tense down, and panting through a huge, cum-covered smile, he rolled onto his side. He liked still the feeling of smacking his cock against the floor with the turn, and just lay there, basking in the remnants of the greates orgasm he had ever had the fortune of undderstanding. He let out a breathy sigh, and opened his dripping eyelids. Hurina was still unconcious in her bed, and he could still feel the urge to let loose a second time.<br />
&quot;Oh God, this is going to be great!&quot; he said to himself. Then, using his mental power, he cleaned up his cum, and strode over to the sleeping herm.<br />
&quot;Wake up.&quot; he commanded.</p>
