<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A late evening and all were sound asleep in their bed&#39;s, but not their Daddy. Stan was up probing the internet for whatever could turn a man of 54 years horny.<br />
<br />
Sex and sensual play had waned quite a bit and things just didn&#39;t work as they once did. His manly beauty was also draining with hair loss and muscles weakening.<br />
<br />
Then an interesting program of possible delight, a down load which he knew not enough to say no, so he keyed a yes. His computer began to accept the raw data and it&#39;s little yellow light flashed and flashed.<br />
<br />
Minutes went by as the he sat dumbfounded at what his computer was getting. At long last he was about half asleep when it freed up giving him a note to expect some new sensor equipment in the mail.<br />
<br />
Well days went by and nothing came as Stan&#39;s hoped dwindled. Then on a Saturday morning came the ringing of his doorbell. The Postal lady had left a Priority Mail box on his doorstep.<br />
<br />
Stan opened it like it was Christmas in July. Inside he found two special sensors, some connecting wire and a short instruction how and where to place them.<br />
<br />
Delighted, he went to work adding the special equipment to the computer and glad that it being Saturday all else were out doing other things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Done!&quot; he said aloud like most older men who talk to themselves.<br />
<br />
As the computer warmed up it had a security code needed to open the program called &quot;Chronivac Version 4.0&quot;. Quickly Stan searched through the waste paper from the sensor package. At last he saw taped to the bottom of the box a small envelope. Inside he found the code, &quot;Fable/4.0/Entice.org&quot; which he reading, ran to the computer and entered.<br />
<br />
####### THIS CODE MUST BE ENTERED EACH TIME THIS PROGRAM IS OPTIONED ##<br />
<br />
&quot;Good then Jeff won&#39;t be probing my stuff like normal!&quot; grumbled Stan about his one computer guru 19 year old son.<br />
<br />
Tap, tap, boink, went his two finger joe typing to open the program.<br />
<br />
Inserting base data:<br />
<br />
Remove all clothing and stand directly in front the red scanner.<br />
To begin touch &quot;Enter when ready, a 10 second pause will allow suject time to enter the sensor&#39;s beam.<br />
<br />
As the red light on sensor comes on begin turning slowly allowing full insertion of physical data.<br />
<br />
When light turns off hit &quot;Enter&quot; again to retain the physical scan data on your hard drive. This information will be needed at a later time for reprocess or return to normal physical condition.<br />
<br />
Stan sat down and read the screen with wild anticapation.<br />

<br />
Not a day later Jeffery took note of the computer and its odd looking extra apparatus. He fired up the computer and discovered to his wildest imagined delight a program that seemed to deal with things he had fantisized and felt a real need.<br />
<br />
The screen flickered and then spelled out, &quot;Supplement 20&quot;.<br />
<br />
Odd thought Jeff but what of his wish to be all fuzzy and warm he remembered from his cousin&#39;s younger days, and of there prize pony. The wild and sensual thought of being and feeling like that little animal had long since captivated Jeff&#39;s imagination.<br />
<br />
As the green-lighted ray shined a circle on the floor Jeff still clothed and filled with desire stepped into the spotlight.<br />
<br />
Standing bathed in the green glow of the ray emitter Jeff saw the monitor screen flash, go black, and then light up with a red background. His eyesight seemed to be getting out of focus but with the colored background, he still could read the larger words.<br />
<br />
FURRY TRANSFORMATIONS<br />
<br />
PONY: <br />
GENDER: MALE<br />
BREED: HAFLINGER<br />
AGE: FIVE YEARS OLD (MATURE)<br />
MENTAL: CONTINUED MEMORY PATTERNS IN FORCE<br />
HEALTH: EXCELLENT CONDITION<br />
<br />
SECTION &quot;B&quot; RULE 9<br />
SELECTION # 20<br />
<br />
What Jeff could read seemed just what he thought would make him a sensual and thrilling time as something he&#39;d fancied for several years.<br />
<br />
It was then his vision blurred and the room filled with dozens of strange but easily noted smells. As he sniffed the air, his nose and mouth were growing into a pony muzzle. His eye spread apart as his skull grew to pony shape.<br />
<br />
Neck gained length, mass, and thickened of solid muscles. Shoulders began to grow tearing Jeff&#39;s shirt and popping the buttons in all directions.<br />
<br />
The expanding of his chest and lengthening of his backbone all went so fast and smooth he barely noticed. It was as the change moved into his lower back, butt, groin, and thighs he had his first real touch of pain.<br />
<br />
A sharp pain not to be toyed with his tail jutted out of above his rump and the growing of the tail hairs each gave him a pricking pain. As it flourished long and pony like thick he began to sway it over a new and sensual rump.<br />
<br />
Pleased with himself for having chosen to become like cousin Steve&#39;s pet pony Jeff stood trying to balance himself in an upright position.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...Jeff what are you doing?&quot; came a frightened question from his older sister as she walked into the room.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s clothing lay on the floor but to any common person what still stood under the green rays of the emitter was a pony with still human feet.<br />
<br />
Tina stood for a moment and then plopped her cute butt into the chair next to the hard working computer. She gave a squinting wink at her still changing brother and then turned to look at the computer screen. Reading it and the inserted square mentioning the rules and contract wording, Tina stopped, smiled and then began to read aloud the fine print with obvious interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really liked that pony didn&#39;t you? Well I think you are going to learn to like it for quite a while as you selected the Section &quot;B&quot; which instigated the program rule number 9. If you had read the rules of the program you might have taken note of this section, as when you quickly typed in a big 20, you ordered the program to extend its general settings from either hours or days, to weeks, and maybe months. You my dear pony brother chose the 20 and along with it came the word FIXED. If you read the glossary meaning of the word fixed, you would see it means like permanent, as if you were born this way!&quot; said Tina to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Tina continued with a few minutes of reading and study, as meanwhile Jeff completed his transitioning in form, standing soundly before his sister, Jeff then as a fully mature five-year-old stallion Haflinger pony.<br />
<br />
As the emitter light faded into a faint glimmer of green haze, Jeff snorted feeling his new self from many new and strange ways, one such came with his flicking a tail, the coarse hairs made a comforted rustling sound while he stood patiently by his sister, she giving him a good look about him once more.<br />
<br />
Tina returned to reading more of what the rules and stipulations said about the general program of Furry Transformations. A lip nibble to her knee from Jeff did the trick and she turned to face her younger but then pony brother.<br />
<br />
A loud whinny came out from the pony mouth, as his hot breath touched the bare leg of his human sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat program, I hope you read the disclaimer well before doing this thing? I suspect not as you do not ever read a book from cover to cover! You remind me of our Cousin Steve and his pony, right?&quot; asked Tina.<br />
<br />
A nod of the pony head agreed with his sisterly comment.<br />
<br />
A soft whinny from Jeff as he began to realize this fandango of a lark might leave him permanently as a pony his whole life long. The thought was at the same time something seemingly neat and filled with adventure, if not some interesting fun times, and there in front of Sister Tina, Jeff became aroused, unfurling his pentad up maleness and letting it drop, swell, and begin to rise with a massive amount of libido. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt as wonderfully alive as his mind floated about locked into the head of a blonde haired Haflinger pony. He turned in circles eyeing his then new body, as that massive erection flung harshly side, to side, slapping at his flanks, and making even Tina become uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do like it, don&#39;t you my stupid brother!&quot; said Tina as actually making fun of him. She reaching out a hand and giving his stout and nearly rigid maleness a sensual slap.<br />
<br />
Ignoring Tina had become an ongoing test of Jeff and his usual male will, as she could come up with the most tacky comments, at the right times.<br />
<br />
Standing up and reaching a hand Tina fingered at the mane that had sprouted out the top of one newly reshaped pony head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know something brother pony of mine, as a pony you make a striking form of one made male and for a reason. Say I help you along with being this pony form, and take you to live on the Killingsworth Farm. John Killingsworth is an ole&#39; school chum, he would take you in, and as such a prime stallion would allow you to breed, mate and find enjoyment! That was your original thought I imagine when you began this fool idea. Silly brother, sex and your predilection for wanting and having sex it with girls has brought you to lusting for it even from inside a different species. Oh, you thought I did not know of your late night romps, well I followed you a couple of times.&quot; said Tina, hands on hips and standing before Jeff, his pony face unable to show his surprise.<br />
<br />
A moment of absolute silence went by, and then Jeff reached his head out forward. A black skinned pony muzzle poked into a normally hot and tight groin of his sister Tina. A sniff in drew her scent, making Tina shiver with wonder how it might feel to have such a mammoth male shaft up and inside her sensual parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn you, your more of a pervert as a pony than when you where my insane brother!&quot; screamed Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey calm down up there!&quot; called out a warning from their Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, she is home, and what am I going to do with your sorry hide?&quot; wondered Tina not wishing her mother to know and see Jeff, he standing still aroused and as much acting like a stallion pony and a hot blooded stud. <br />
<br />
Tina left the room as Jeff stood discovering his maleness as a truly wondrous new thrill. The thought to ask her mother for something she knew they had none in the house, Tina pleaded for Mom to get her some from a nearby store.<br />
<br />
Motherly love is boundless, and once the dear woman had driven out of sight, Tina went to get Jeff downstairs and planned of taking him to the Killingsworth farm.<br />
<br />
As she entered the bedroom, Jeff stood there working his exceptional pony libido, humped over his bed and doing it in true pony style.<br />
<br />
Tina stood silently watching as brother Jeff blew his first big load of pony stallion semen. It spewed forth like water from a garden hose. The white cum and thick cream of pony semen reminded Tina of the vanilla pudding they all enjoyed the previous night at supper. One fair sized puddle of his cum looked like the creamy pudding, as some thicker globs of equine semen resembled the rounded pearls of what Tina thought of as if the sweet Tapioca.<br />
<br />
A red scarf made for a halter, as Tina looped it about the pony neck, dragging the young stud out of his bedroom and to the back lawn where he lowered his head and began to graze. The instincts were making their presence known to Jeff; he gave in quickly to them, as if forced upon him after he finished ejaculating like a true stallion pony.<br />
<br />
The finding of a rope in the garage made it and easy job to move the degrading mind of what was her brother, he soon to become an interracial part in a farm scene.<br />
<br />
When Tina presented to John with her newest friend and pony, she made up a story of it just wandering about the back lawn, as if it were lost. She was sly about her plan, removing some of the clothing Jeff wore more often and then typing a number of notes and a final letter to his parents about wanting to seek adventure, and thought he would “Hit the road.”<br />
<br />
Weeks later when the local police gave up on searching for Jeff, he being missing for more than three months, a cautious Tina went to visit her brother.<br />
<br />
She along with John Killingsworth went to the stables, and there when they arrived, the stable groom had Jeff already hard at his proper duty, he humping away, his black Haflinger pony shaft sunk deep into the vulva of a pretty mare. The stallion stopped his thrusting when he saw Tina standing near the stall. He whinnied to her his greeting, then turned toward the mare, and began to hump in brutal earnest.<br />
<br />
John remarked how different then the normal pony stallions, this stud kept its stall and body in a rather exceptionally cleaner manner of personal hygiene, as if his chosen routine, he waits until morning to crap and urinate outside of his stall. As well to the strange habits of the stallion, John made mention of the pony stallion and its manners when mounted and after the mating; he would work and toy with his tool, enjoying later the washing of it by the stable groomsman. <br />
<br />
Tina tried hard to make John became her best friend, and after a couple of years, they were married. <br />
<br />
John made note of his dear wife took control of the animal breeding, with special attention to the Haflinger pony she named as Jeffery, in honor of her dearly loved and missing brother. Her attentions were not limited to just the Haflinger stud, but to some of his exceptionally horny mares, a large gray haired Billy Goat, and even a couple of the Killingsworth Black Angus bulls that became prize winning sires.<br />
<br />
Tina helped the farm grow, and from her office she had in the corner of one big barn, a door leading from her private office opened directly into a rarely used corral. <br />
<br />
Jeff remained enthused and happy as a Haflinger pony stallion and stud, doing what then came naturally to him, he stood proud of his accomplished siring hundreds of bright and exceptionally quick to learn foals.<br />
<br />
The memories of Jeff as whether he was alive or dead faded with the passing of some several years. He remained alert and well knowledgeable of his own origin, of the way he became as he stood then a stallion, and of his dear sister. Tina never forgot Jeff, but would ride him often, or together they worked the county fairs, winning many a blue ribbon.<br />
<br />
The computer and its special adapted green ray, Tina kept as a memento of her missing brother, knowing its powerful program was still intact. She would when warranted from some special occasions, make particular use of the program and the strange green emitter. As of those sober or drunken men that might wish to test the integrity of her marriage vows, she would ask of them to strip naked before her, and stand under a shower of green light to disinfect them before they should have their chance to mate. <br />
<br />
Jeff and his predilection for living the lusty lifestyle of a Haflinger stud won him a special notice by an unknown author, I am assured by Tina he might have had cherished feelings for the man, especially if he saw his picture added to a portion of that story.</p>
