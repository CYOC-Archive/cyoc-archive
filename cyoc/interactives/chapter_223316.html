<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not knowing when the growth would stop, Amanda quickly ran to her body mirror to see her results. Well, as quickly as a 6-year-old would be if she wasn&#39;t already used to her enhancing form. By the time she had made it to her mirror, the growth began to slow down. While B-cups may be nothing to an adult, in Amanda&#39;s young form they are something. The gentle swell form of Amanda&#39;s newly grown boobs has pushed her girly top to show some minor cleavage. <br />
&quot;Why are they still so small?&quot; Amanda frowns to herself while posing in front of the mirror and feeling up herself. Amanda could feel the weight that came from her freshly grown tits and the tight feeling from her T-shirt as well. She then took her top off in order to see her bare chest in their naked glory. The suppleness of youth has graced Amanda&#39;s breasts without marking her with stretch marks. Her nipples have gained a few bumps on them and grew in size, but overall they haven&#39;t changed much in that growth spurt. Once her top was removed, Amanda&#39;s breasts then their separate ways. And yet they still have some mass in them for Amanda to feel on her inner arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, it&#39;s a start,&quot; Amanda said after she had finished admiring herself. Amanda then put her shirt back on again and decided to see how her world changed around her. On the outside, nothing had changed much. Her room is still in tones of purple and violets. She still has her purple bed with her favorite stuffies and her lilac-colored cubby hole that holds her toys and games. Her lavender desk has her personal tablet and her school supplies, which she still needs to do. But when Amanda opened her closet, she found the first of the many changes she would find later on. The first things she saw were bras. Her own personal bras, with her measurements on them. Amanda took one of them out to see how big she got. <br />
<br />
25B.<br />
<br />
The fact that her first growth spurt for the following week only brought her to B-cups has left the poor girl feeling quite upset about it. In fact, it even brought tears to her eyes. &quot;NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!NO! IT&#39;S NOT FAIR! IT&#39;S NOT FAIR! IT&#39;S NOT FAIR!&quot; wailed out Amanda while she banged her hands and feet on her royal purple-colored play rug, still gripping her bra that started the tantrum. Eventually, Madison came up to Amanda&#39;s door to see what going on that would cause that racket. &quot;Amanda, are you okay in there?&quot; asked the babysitter through the door. &quot;WHYWHYWHYWHY!?!&quot; is all that Madison can hear from the other side of the door, making it very clear that Amanda hasn&#39;t heard a word from the 17 years old girl. Wanting to make sure that Amanda is okay, Madison lets herself in to see what happens to Amanda.<br />
What Madison sees is a young 6-year-old girl, floundering about the floor, grasping a bra in her little hand. Even when Madison opens the door, Amanda is still crying about something being &quot;unfair to her&quot;. Connecting the dots, Madison walked up to the snotty child and gave her a few pats on her back. The action snaps Amanda from her misery and focuses her attention on her babysitter. &quot;I know how you feel Amanda,&quot; Madison calmly spoke to Amanda. &quot;You do?&quot; Amanda said between her sniffles. &quot;Yeah. When I was around your age, my breasts came in too.&quot; Madison gestured to her own chest. And Madison&#39;s chest is big, with her being the biggest breasts Amanda has ever seen in her life. &quot;But,&quot; Madison continued, &quot;I got help to work around them. Even to make sure that I can help however I can to young girls like you to move past their bra size and be a proper person when they get older.<br />
<br />
Now feeling calmer about how juvenile it is to be crying about her bra, Amanda felt a little bit better about herself. But looking into her babysitter&#39;s baby feeders made the young girl envious of how big she became. &quot;Madison, can I ask you a question?&quot; asked Amanda after she shifted her eyes from Madison&#39;s cleavage to her face. Madison sighed to herself, knowing what types of questions Amanda may asked. She brought her hand up to count her FAQs. &quot;One: I&#39;m a 34L cup. Two: No, I&#39;m not pregnant nor do I want to be pregnant. and Three: You can&#39;t touch them.&quot; The way that Madison had told Amanda really shows that Madison has been hearing these questions for some time. &quot;No, it wasn&#39;t those.&quot; Amanda defiantly replies to her current guardian. &quot;Oh, then what is it then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I try on your bra?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison was shocked, to say the least. The fact that a child that she is supposed to look after is asking to try on her expensive bra is ridiculous. Madison would have half a mind to yell at such a stupid notion, and the other half to punish her by saying &#39;No computer for the rest of the night!&#39; and sent her to do her homework. But looking down at Amanda&#39;s young face (and down her shirt to see her sweater puppies without a leash) just reminded Madison of her own youthful days. With those days having her see bras being bigger than her head. Plus, Amanda&#39;s parents won&#39;t be back till 1 in the morning. &quot;Fine. I&#39;ll let you try on my bra.&quot; Madison glumly agreed to take off her bra for Amanda.  &quot;But I going to need some privacy, if you please.&quot; Madison quickly spoke before Amanda rushed to her breasts. &#39;I&#39;m not going to strip in front of a child.&#39; Madison mumbled to herself while she exited Amanda&#39;s door and entered the bathroom, locking the door behind her.<br />
After a few minutes, Madison exited the bathroom. This time with her black bra in her hands and her breasts hanging lower than before she entered the bathroom. Her flat nipples tented out her top, with her areola distorting the graphic as well.  Madison entered Amanda&#39;s room again, this time with a lot more bounce in her chest. &quot;Here we go Amanda. My massive bra.&quot; For the little girl, it&#39;s truly massive. The cup alone can be used as a hat and it can covered for another few more inches. &quot;Yay! Thank you Madison.&quot; Amanda thanked her swaying babysitter and she began to take off her own shirt. &quot;WOAH there! Let me leave the room first. Then you can put it on.&quot; Madison doesn&#39;t want to be listed as a pedophile due to being in the same room with a kid who is trying on underwear. Once Madison exited the door and closed it behind her, Amanda continued to take off her shirt. Due to the magic of the computer program, Amanda happens to have the know-how to put on Madison&#39;s bra.<br />
<br />
Of course, the bra is too big. It was like two thickly made bags that had been tied together. &quot;Soon, this bra will fit me, &quot; Amanda thought to herself, giving herself a sense of pride within her chest. But it wasn&#39;t just pride filling up inside, it was her breast! &quot;Yes! Finally!&quot; Amanda cheered in her head. She walks over to the mirror to see the expansion better. &quot;They are growing so big now, I wonder how big they will get this time?&quot; is the one thought in Amanda&#39;s head while her boobs slowly fill up the bra.</p>
