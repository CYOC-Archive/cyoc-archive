<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David&#39;s rush to the bathroom halted immediately as he shut the door behind him.  He stood stock still as Chuck finished clicking pause on his avatar.  <br />
<br />
 Chuck turned his attention to Colin.  <br />
<br />
Colin sat there mortified.  He had embarrassed himself and his dad. He was in for trouble and not only that but now he was alone with this neighbor.  <br />
<br />
 Chuck looked at the boy and felt an unexpected burst of empathy.  Sure, he was going to add this kid and his dad to his no longer merely mental spank bank, but he would help this kid a bit.  <br />
<br />
Chuck finally spoke to the teen, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not upset about the window.  I know it was an accident.  I think you will grow to find that an accident can sometimes end up being an opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin looked at the weird man and tried to relax.  <br />
<br />
Chuck clicked a a bit on the boy&#39;s profile and saw some interesting things:<br />
<br />
Colin Smart<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Sexuality: Homosexual<br />
Age: 17<br />
Height: 5&#39;8&quot;<br />
Weight: 122 lbs<br />
IQ: 145<br />
<br />
Chuck scrolled through the expected statistics of the scrawny nerd until he found a status bar that called out to him. He dialed the boy&#39;s honesty up to 100.  <br />
<br />
Chuck said to the boy, &quot;If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin looked at him and stammered out, &quot;I want to be good at baseball.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck raised his eyebrows.  He had expected the boy to want to change his sexuality.  It was all too common at that age to feel weird about being &quot;different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come?&quot; Chuck asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s the only thing my dad really really cares about.  I want to be someone he&#39;s proud of.&quot; Colin said without hesitation.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you and your dad are both in luck. I&#39;m in the unique position to help you both in all kinds of ways. Do you trust me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot; The boy said.  Chuck paused Colin&#39;s avatar with a chuckle.  Then he started to once again edit reality.  <br />
<br />
The boy froze and his clothes vanished. Chuck began to work typing away.  Up went the boy&#39;s age to nineteen.  Down went his IQ.  Chuck added a foot and a couple inches of height to him.  He took away what little body fat he had and added a bunch of muscle. He enhanced the little package the teen had giving him a big package to scratch as the pitch clock ran down. He changed the boy&#39;s shy nature to gregarious and gave him a desire to show off.  Last but not least, he took away the boy&#39;s dark hair and replaced it with a golden blonde hue.  Finally he changed the boy&#39;s name.  Cole Stout. <br />
<br />
He unpaused the boy and all the changes snapped into place.  The young stud came back to reality by rocketing spurt after spurt of cum onto his now chiseled abs and prominent chest.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; He said, a second or two after the afterglow subsided.  His now deeper voice causing him to start a bit.  He went to cover his crotch but merely draped one arm over the softening organ.  &quot;Ugh sorry about your couch.&quot; He apologized with a grin.  <br />
<br />
Chuck typed a bit and the globs of sperm vanished and a full length mirror appeared.  The jock stood in front of the mirror and flexed unfazed by his nudity.  &quot;I&#39;m freaking jacked. And tall. And HUNG!&quot; He said, the last word coming out fast as he hefted his flaccid but impressive organ.   &quot;I must be at least six inches soft!&quot; He started to chub up at the sight of himself.  <br />
&quot;Actually, you&#39;re 6.5 inches soft, 10.5 inches hard,&quot; Chuck said remembering his stats,  But calm down and lets get you some clothes.<br />
<br />
Chuck typed a bit and a pair of tennis shoes and socks appeared on his feet, a jockstrap and then some shorts appeared on his waist and a hat completed the look of a sexy jock who was practicing moments before.  Chuck smiled and added a gold chain to his neck.  It looked a little slutty and that was just fine with him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s about time for your dad to rejoin us,&quot; Chuck said as the boy sat down on the couch.  Chuck paused the boy and went back to work on David Smart.  <br />
<br />
Chuck smiled.  This was great work and while it wasn&#39;t Michael and his boys, he had a feeling that he was going to do a great job at bringing this family together.   He began making David into the father that Cole deserved.  After a while, he pressed enter and heard David take a step toward the toilet.  <br />
<br />
It was a glance in the mirror that made David stop dead in his tracks.<br />
<br />
At first glance, he realized he wasn&#39;t wearing the clothes that he had come in with. Instead of the old t-shirt and black shorts he had thrown on to practice with his son, everything was different.<br />
<br />
A bright red cap sat on his head and he was now wearing a tight white polo shirt and polyester blue shorts, a pair of tube socks clung to his calves, and on his neck dangled a gold whistle on a string.<br />
<br />
He looked like a stereotypical 80&#39;s coach. It was a look he had laughed about with his colleagues at the school.<br />
<br />
As he looked at his reflection, he noticed the appearance was still changing. On his face, a thick reddish-blonde  mustache appeared above his upper lip, marring his previously clean shaven face.<br />
<br />
Glancing down at the open collar of his shirt, David saw a broad  swath chest hair bloom out of his open white polo. His pinkish brown areolas could be seen through the piqué cotton of the white polo.<br />
<br />
Glancing down farther, David noticed that the polyester shorts that he was wearing had started to creep up his legs going from knee bearing to thigh bearing and exposing his now hirsute thighs to the world. David angled his body to the side and noticed with fear that his ass was expanding as the shorts seemed to be shrinking creating a plump bubbled shelf. The white waist and straps of a jockstrap could be seen peeking out of the top and bottom of the shorts respectively.<br />
<br />
David looked at what he could see in the mirror and realized that he looked like a Tom of Finland version of a coach. He knew he hadn&#39;t known that reference prior to entering the toilet in this strange man&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
A pang of urgency interrupted his shocked appraisal of his body. David positioned himself in front of the toilet, fiddling with the fly on the unfamiliar shorts.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, David pulled down the shorts to reveal the prominent bulge in the slightly stained, white jock he knew he&#39;d never worn before. Pulling down his shorts, he realized his dick and balls had changed too.  They were bigger.  Instead of pissing like he had planned to, he found himself blasting the bowl with a load of yellowish white cum.<br />
<br />
Chuck heard the muffled moan of the man as he blasted at the toilet.   Then he saw the embarrassed man try and clean up the mess before rushing back out of the bathroom.    <br />
<br />
David rushed out to the bathroom and back down the hall.  Something weird was happening in this house and he and his son had to get out of here.  <br />
<br />
David came into the room and he saw Chuck there with his computer and a young man seated on the couch.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down David.&quot; Chuck said with a few taps and clicks.  <br />
<br />
David felt himself calm down and he began to survey the room.  <br />
<br />
Chuck began to speak. And while he did, David didn&#39;t move. It was almost as if he couldn&#39;t. But, he did begin to sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I talked to your son for a bit while you were, shall we say indisposed.&quot; Chuck waggled his eyebrows as if to say he knew that David had gone into the bathroom to yank one out.  <br />
<br />
Chuck continued, &quot;I asked your son what, if anything, he would change about his life if he could. With total honesty, and without a second&#39;s hesitation, he said, &#39;I wish I was good at baseball because that&#39;s all my dad cares about.&#39; Isn&#39;t that heartbreaking?&quot; David balked realizing that the young man who was sitting on the couch there wasn&#39;t a stranger.  It was his son.  <br />
<br />
Chuck continued, &quot;It&#39;s sad you know.  I learned a lot about your son and I decided that I would help him live up to and even surpass your expectations. But I also decided that you needed to have some shared interests with him as well. <br />
<br />
Dave found himself unwillingly looking over his son&#39;s frozen form. Behind his eyes he saw none of the intelligence that he normally expected. Instead, he just saw simple contentment and something else.<br />
<br />
Chuck kept talking. &quot;Cole here is the perfect jock son. He can bat, he can run, and he can pitch. He&#39;s everything you&#39;ve ever wanted and more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave thought for a brief moment Chuck had said, &quot;Cole&quot; but his son was named something different. His son was named Col... Coli.... Cole was his son&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
He focused back on what Chuck was saying. &quot;...once I made Cole the total package a coach like you wanted, I had some more ideas on how you could share some of his interests as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave continued to look at his changed son. What he saw unnerved him. There was his son, but it wasn&#39;t his son. Instead of the pale tiny nerd, in his place, manspreading in the middle of the couch was a barely clothed hunk. Gone was the weak nerd that he had pushed and pushed to be a barely useful bat boy. Instead, a young man sat in his place who looked like he was minutes if not seconds from playing for the major leagues. Gone were his glasses, pale skin, and bowl cut and in their place rested the tanned and confident head framed by a blonde mullet. His shirt was gone and he displayed a pair of broad pecs and abs dusted with blonde hair. The only clothing he wore was his cap, shoes, and shorts. Concealed within the mesh material, David could see a hefty cock and balls that pulled the supportive underwear away from the base of his torso to show an inch or two of shaved pubes.<br />
<br />
Coach Stout realized what had changed as his own altered cock began to tent his tight  khaki shorts.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You made us gay!?&quot; Dave tried to snarl but he only spoke calmly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I made you gay,&quot; Chuck replied with the same calmness but tinged with a bit of an edge.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Your son was gay. He probably would have come out to you if you had seen it fit to have any interest in him doing anything other than swinging a bat, or if you seemed to care at all about him other than his lack of athletic ability.&quot; Chuck said.  &quot;Now you have at least two shared interests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You made me gay for my son?&quot; Dave spoke.  A glare at Chuck being the only indication of his rage.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I just made you really really really gay.&quot; Chuck said, his eyes shining with glee.  &quot;I think you&#39;ll find that you&#39;re about as obsessed with men as you ever were with baseball. It just happens to be that your all-star slugger here is quite the specimen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me give you a bit of a refresher on the last 20 years of your new life.  <br />
<br />
Chuck hit an icon that said, &quot;Parallel retcon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s mind whirled as he remembered his own struggles with his sexuality, the one time with a woman that resulted in Cole, his buddies on the baseball team that would sometimes let him suck them off, his sluttier college years where he was still hoping to go pro.  His injury that led to the shattering of that dream but a long term relationship with an older male nurse.  His graduation and his coaching job.  The tough time he had ignoring the hot young men in the locker rooms.  The years of jerking it to gay porn.  Letting his assistant coach plow him after a long practice.  That time he let a mascot fuck him with the costume on. The principal he had gone down on to keep Cole off of academic probation so he could lead the team to victory his junior year.  <br />
<br />
Coach Stout blew a load into his shorts.  In a second, a lifetime&#39;s worth of sexual acts had been shoved into his mind as his life was retooled by Chuck.   <br />
<br />
Dave felt himself hit his knees, damn that really hurt his left one, as he came again and again, drenching the front of his short shorts.  <br />
<br />
When he was done, he was panting in a puddle of his own jizz.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up!&quot; Chuck commanded him.  <br />
<br />
Dave Stout stood and instantly, his puddle of cum vanished along with his shorts.  Dave, finding that he could move again went to cover himself but found that he was instead jerking his dick back to hardness.  <br />
<br />
&quot;When I said you were as obsessed with men as much as baseball, I didn&#39;t exclude yourself,&quot;   Chuck said with a grin.  You&#39;re going to find it hard, if you&#39;ll excuse the pun, to focus on anything else for most of the day.  Dick and coaching, ass and stats, cum and strategy, baseball and well, balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve made me into a freak,&quot;  Dave said, a tear forming in his eye as he continued to grope himself to full mast again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ve expanded your very narrow set of interests by a mere margin.&quot; Chuck said gleefully. <br />
&quot;Now, you&#39;re going to want to probably do something about that weapon you&#39;ve got there.&quot;  I suggest locking it up during working hours.<br />
<br />
Chuck tapped a bit and a cage appeared on the coach&#39;s cock.   Coach Dave&#39;s hands flinched away from the cold and heavy metal that now encased his member.   He was still turned on but he was prevented from acting on it.  <br />
<br />
Dave whimpered, &quot;This isn&#39;t right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck seemed to boil over with rage at the mewling man.   &quot;What isn&#39;t right is forcing your son to live out your fantasies at the expense of his own life and happiness! You took a bright child with gifts and hopes and crushed him into your idea of success even though he had no hope of ever achieving it.  You&#39;re lucky you aren&#39;t his fucking jockstrap right now!&quot; Chuck roared.  <br />
<br />
He was right, Dave realized, about two things he had forced his son to chase after his dreams and Chuck had unlimited power in this situation. <br />
<br />
He hung his head and Chuck seemed to calm.   &quot;That boy deserved a father not a coach.  Now he has a daddy and a coach.&quot; <br />
<br />
Coach Stout looked at the stud still frozen on the couch. He remembered all the pressure that he had put on him and now, because of that pressure, he had asked this creep to change him.   Dave also realized that he had seen and fantasized not only about his new son&#39;s baseball career but also about his body and he blushed and hung his head in shame.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t make me fuck my son.&quot; He spoke in almost a whisper.  <br />
<br />
Chuck gasped in mock horror. &quot;I would never!&quot; He said, knowing that he had made one of Michael&#39;s kids do that this morning.  &quot;No, you&#39;re not going to ever go farther than he wants you to. You&#39;ll find yourself unable to initiate any sexual actions with him unless he wants it.  Sure, you guys might want to watch some porn together along with some of his practice tapes but unless he asks you, you&#39;ll never go farther than that without his insistence. Besides, it&#39;s not like either of you is going to get pregnant so what&#39;s the big deal about a couple of grown men having some fun. Cole now only remembers you as a contented DILF slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave shuddered, knowing in his heart of hearts that his son was going to be a constant source of temptation.  <br />
<br />
Chuck continued, &quot;Unless, you want me to let him put a baby in you, I can help you two field a whole team of little sluggers if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please no!&quot; Dave said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I could be just playing.  I would want to make sure you&#39;re a much better parent this time around before I give you more kids to fuck up. Let&#39;s get you cleaned up and ready to reintroduce yourself to Cole.&quot; <br />
<br />
With a few clicks, Coach Stout was back in his shirt shorts and seated on the couch.  <br />
<br />
After a few seconds, the Stouts stirred back to life.  <br />
<br />
Chuck started talking to them as if nothing had ever happened.  &quot;Well, it looks like that window is going to be about $300 dollars to replace.&quot; Chuck said.  <br />
<br />
Cole draped his larger arm over Dave&#39;s shoulder causing Dave&#39;s face to redden as the young hunk made skin to skin contact with him and the musk from his son&#39;s pit wafted to him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I sure am sorry Mr. Chuck,&quot;  Cole said with a bit of a grin, &quot;every once in a while I hit a foul ball here or there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it was an accident,&quot; Chuck said.  <br />
<br />
Coach Dave looked at his boy with lust and love.  <br />
<br />
Then his son said something he didn&#39;t expect, &quot;I&#39;m sure my dad can do something to make it up to you.&quot; And he winked saying, &quot;From what he&#39;s told me, that mouth of his can do more than blow a whistle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole got up, adjusted a tent that was forming in his jock and left leading Dave in a stunned silence.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry coach, I&#39;ll let you work it off over time.&quot; Chuck said with an evil laugh as he pulled down a zipper and exposed a an uncut cock that was even bigger than Cole&#39;s.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me, I&#39;m comparing this pervert&#39;s dick to my son&#39;s,&quot; Dave thought.  The thought made him feel ashamed and turned on.   He crawled over and began to tease the massive organ with his lips and then slapped the meaty organ against his cheek. <br />
<br />
He looked up at Chuck as he fondled the rigid dong. &quot;I still remember my old life but I love this.&quot; Then he took the whole massive dick into his throat until his nose was nestled in Chuck&#39;s greasy pubes.  <br />
<br />
Chuck sighed contentedly, &quot;I may have to let that himbo son of yours break more shit around here,&quot; he said as he relaxed and let the insatiable daddy slurp and suck to his heart&#39;s content.</p>
