<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Wrestling” replied Derrick. Despite being slow to develop, at 15 Derrick had begun to distinguish himself on his high school wrestling team. He was relatively short at 5’7” and his coaches had encouraged him to start working out harder to take advantage of his lean, compact build. Workouts hadn’t done much to build muscle, but his natural balance and wiry strength made him a promising future athlete. Derrick hoped the rest of puberty would hit soon so he’d have a shot of moving from JV to varsity next year.<br />
<br />
“A classic” said the attendant, and smiled as he dipped his hands in a basin filled with pale yellow oil. “Let’s see what we’re really working with.”<br />
<br />
Derrick thought that was an odd thing to say, but instantly forgot about it as the young man attending him laid his hands on Derrick’s chest. Warmth seemed to emanate from where they touched his skin, instantly relaxing him. The man rubbed the boy’s pecs, pressing deep before continuing to his shoulders. Derrick sighed with surprised satisfaction.<br />
<br />
“Wow that feels good,” his voice cracked embarrassingly, but the bliss was too much for him to feel too self conscious.<br />
<br />
“Just stay relaxed,” said the masseur, pausing to dip his hands back in the oil. “This sometimes  hurts a little.”<br />
<br />
Hurts? thought Derrick. It felt great! But just as he though this, he felt an uncomfortable twinge in his pecs, a twitch followed by a growing dull ache as if he’d worked out too much. The masseur had moved on to his arms, rubbing his small biceps between his fingers and thumbs, and Derrick tried to concentrate on that. His pecs continues aching though, and then they started to twitch, the small muscles spawning. Derrick looked down to see his chest, and then sat bolt upright. <br />
<br />
“What the hell?”<br />
<br />
His pecs had swollen, growing larger with muscle with every twitch, to the point that Derrick could see his chest muscles clearly for the first time in his life. As he watched, he saw his nipples enlarge, the areolas darkening and moving downward as his chest flexed involuntarily.<br />
<br />
“Hold still,” said the attendant, “don’t interrupt the process. You’re doing well on your journey.”<br />
<br />
What was that supposed to mean? “Fuck,” Derek cursed, even as the numb sensation spread to his shoulders and upper arms and the attendant tried to gently push him back to lying on the massage bed. “What’s happening?”<br />
<br />
“If you don’t relax, the massage’s effects will be quite painful. Lie down.” This time the masseur reached Derrick’s lower back, exposed now that he was sitting up, and as soon as his hands connected Derrick felt his strength to sit draining away, his lower back becoming numb. Even as he lay down again, he felt his shoulders begin the same twitching and swelling that had begun in his chest. Turning his head, he saw his shoulders broaden as he felt a deep grinding and slightly painful cracking in his upper body. His skin creates friction against the bed as his shoulders widened. Derrick groaned as his muscles flexed: his deltoids and biceps swelling and subsiding, swelling larger and subsiding less. as if they were being gradually pumped up like balloons.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing to me, you freak,” Derrick gritted out as he felt the masseur’s hands rubbing his smooth stomach and working their way lower.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry this is uncomfortable for you. As I said, you will be more comfortable if you relax.”<br />
<br />
“I,” Derrick began, when his stomach clenched and he cried out from the tingling pain spreading across his abdomen. His body seemed to be fighting a losing battle against the changes as his trim mid-section expanded, thickening his sides and growing into a slight belly. What was this??<br />
<br />
“Do not be concerned, this is all a natural part of your progression” said the masseur as he worked his hands down onto Derrick’s thighs. Derrick’s onset of horror at discovering he had a belly was replaced by fascination at the next change. His stomach tightened, his skin almost burning, as new muscles appeared that had only been hinted at in his body before. Two abs emerged at the top of his stomach, swelling, tightening, and then joined for two more, and two more again as he developed a sharply cut six-pack. His lats top expanded, transforming the recently gained fat into thick muscle. The masseur paused on his thighs to give one last rub with both hands right at Derrick’s waist, and momentarily his muscles realigned and pulsed into the V-shape he’d seen on the seniors on his wrestling team.<br />
<br />
That thought brought Derrick out of his struggle against the changes as it dawned on him what was really happening. This masseur must be drugging him. This was all a trip based on the suggestion that he was a wrestler.<br />
<br />
“Really man, what are you doing to me?” Derrick tried to stay calm, watching as the masseur circles his thumbs on either side of his upper calves. “This isn’t real right? These drugs won’t stay in my system right?”<br />
<br />
The masseur stopped for the first time, looking honestly surprised. “This is not a drug treatment sir. This is the journey you identified by coming here: you are unlocking the potential you possessed as an athlete, it was simply your will to choose what kind. No turn over.”<br />
<br />
Derrick hesitated, assessing what he’d just thought he’d heard. What was happening was... impossible, right? He didn’t feel in control of his body yet, but he cautiously moved his right hand up and across his muscular chest to touch his left bicep. It felt real. Thick, bigger than his dad’s, bigger than some of the guys on the varsity team. Could this be the real thing?<br />
<br />
“Turn,” said the masseur, and Derrick gave in, flipping over to reveal his butt and back. His thighs were undergoing their transformation now, and he had to wriggle to prevent his ballsack being caught between his thickening muscles. His thighs now pressed together warmly. His attention focused on preserving his balls meant he was hardly bothered by slight tickling of the masseur’s hands kneading the balls of his feet and then working up to the backs of his calves.<br />
<br />
“Your journey is almost complete. You have chosen well. Soon you will know what it is to be a man.”<br />
<br />
Derrick flinched as the masseur pressed hard into his buttocks, rolling then against one another, pressing sideways and then down. It was not a particularly sexual gesture, but Derrick felt his cock begin to stiffen. This was new, he thought, he’d never imagined a butt massage could feel so good. He tried not to think about girls at school, the women he’d seen here at the resort so far, how soft breasts must feel, how close he’d gotten to losing his virginity at the last school dance...<br />
<br />
Blood was rushing to Derrick’s cock, making him increasingly uncomfortable. Then he felt another cracking sensation, this time in his legs and then, again, in his feet. Both felt like they were stretching after a long period of inactivity. His toes curled even as he felt them grow, thicken, and lengthen. His lower legs too felt like they had lengthened somewhat even as new calf muscles inflated on his now-longer limbs. His arms felt similar now too. <br />
<br />
“Just two more steps,” the masseur said gently as he pushed Derrick to move onto his back again. Derrick hesitated again, knowing his cock was fully hard after letting his thoughts stray. “You must be aroused air for the journey to complete.”<br />
<br />
Sir? This was the second time the masseur had addresses him this way. Like he was a man. Derrick liked that. Despite that fact this couldn’t be real, was probably a drug trip or a dream. In those cases, Derrick thought, who cares what this guy sees?<br />
<br />
Derrick slowly rolled over, noting how much heavier his entire body felt. As he lay down, his cock rigid and at its full five and a half inches against his new abs, he felt his glutes spasming, although now that he’d stopped resisting, the pain was less. His growing butt caused him to need to shift on the table, further arching his back and needing to spread his legs apart slightly. He closed his eyes: this actually felt good! Amazing for an imaginary scenario.<br />
<br />
His eyes snapped open as the masseur grasped his dick around the base of his shaft. “What the fuck...” Derrick exclaimed, but he found his energy to protest was rapidly finishing. Plus, this guy was a masseur after all. Derrick has heard of happy endings, but had never thought he’d receive one himself. A few girls at school had hesitantly felt him through his pants while they made out, but no one else had ever grabbed his naked dick before. Was he about to get his first hand job? On top of this crazy trip?<br />
<br />
“Do not move, it could cause discomfort,” said the masseur, and moved his hand up, and then slowly down.” Derrick’s entire body suddenly reacted: intense tingling, warmth, shooting abruptly outward from his cock all the way to to his head and feet. <br />
<br />
“Holy fuck!” Derrick felt so many new sensations that he couldn’t process them all. His body broke out in a full sweat, making it gleam in the room’s low light. The small amount of hair around the base of his cock stood on end, and then his crotch tingled as, while he watched, the hair seemed to thicken and spread. <br />
<br />
The masseur repeated the motion: a quick up and slow down on Derrick’s cock. This time the hair didn’t just spring up at his crotch. Derrick felt an almost unbearable tickle all over his body. His light armpit hairs lengthened, forcing their way out from between his biceps and pecs. His pecs tingled as hair’s emerged first in swirls around his nipples and then spread inward toward the center of his chest. A trail of hair popped out down the center of his six pack. Even his face was itching now, and he knew instinctively that his upper lip and the tip of his chin now had a few days growth of mustache and the beginnings of a beard.<br />
<br />
“We will have to shave you for your athletic events,” said the masseur, “but this is part of your journey into Greek manhood.” Derrick gasped as the masseurs hand ascended and descended again. He knew he was getting close to cumming now. Hair thickened all over him, spreading to cover his lower arms and cropping up all over both thighs and calves. It seemed to be getting darker too, each strand itself thickening and turning from Derrick’s natural mousy brown to a rich black. His abs were now slightly less visible as hair spread out from his treasure trail. His sweat continued to emerge all over, and now he could smell himself, a ripe but manly odor that he’d never had before.<br />
<br />
“Are you ready?” Derrick had long since given up any pretense of understanding what was happening to him. The changes going on throughout his body were causing too much extract to question anymore. “Hhnn” was all he could grunt out: his balls felt incredibly full. <br />
<br />
The masseur stroked Derrick’s cock a final time, and the young man felt his cum spurting upward, shot after shot straight up and landing in his own increasingly dense chest hair. “Ahhhh fuck” he sighed, and was startled to hear his voice deepen even as he cried out. His face twitched and he clenched his teeth as his black beard fully emerged. His chest hair spread upward, reaching his shoulders, and new hair also spring up on the knuckles of his hands and tops of his feet. As his cock started to soften, the skin around it loosened, and for the first time in his memory, Derrick felt a foreskin cupping his cockhead.<br />
<br />
“You are now almost a man, Demetrius,” said the masseur, “and ready to resume your wrestling training. You must complete two more tasks before you are ready to return to the ring.”<br />
<br />
Derrick’s head was still spinning. What had he called him? What did he have to do? Was this real?</p>
