<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a long while the two friends stood in the kitchen, wondering what to do. Tiff was the first to take action, beginning a frantic search of the kitchen in a final effort to do something for her friend. Katie merely stood there, trying to get used to the feel of her new body. Her hands kept going to her face to feel the hair there, before dropping down to feel her muscular, hairy chest. All her new muscles felt nice, she found the feeling of strength that came with them to be pleasant enough. That didn't mean that she liked it, just that it wasn't the worst of the changes. If the milk had made her look like a female body builder, that would have been much better than this. The only good thing was that her pussy was still the same, maybe with a bit more hair, but between her legs she was still the same girl as ever. It was a small comfort to know that something about her hadn't changed.<br />
<br />
After searching the entire kitchen Tiffany was the one in tears. There had been nothing that even looked like it might be remotely useful in their situation. She kicked angrily at the door of an empty cabinet and began to scream, &quot;Nothing! There's nothing in here!&quot;<br />
<br />
She kicked the cabinet again, hard enough to splinter the old wood. That final outburst seemed to take all of her energy, for afterward she stood still, swaying as though she was about to faint, &quot;I'm so sorry Katie. So very sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was enough to start Katie crying again, though this time it was because of how Tiff was blaming herself, &quot;Tiff, don't be so hard on yourself. I shouldn't have drank that stuff without reading the label.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emotionally exhausted they collapsed into each other's arms and cried together, finding that special solace that came from having a friend to cry with during a terrible time. The moment was almost stereotypical of teenage girls save for the fact that anyone who didn't know better would have thought Katie was a very mature looking and well developed teenage boy.<br />
<br />
Soon their crying slowed and then stopped, each finding comfort in the friendship of the other. Tiff reached into her purse and took out some tissues to dry her eyes and handed some to Katie. Dabbing her face dry, Katie realized that her facial hair was soaked with tears, indicating that they'd been crying for much longer than she had thought. The shadows in the kitchen were starting to grow long and looking out the window she saw that night was rapidly falling. Shirtless, the cool twilight air was starting to make her uncomfortable. Rubbing her arms for warmth she looked to see how Tiff was doing. When she determined that Tiff was no longer on the edge of a breakdown she spoke, &quot;It's getting dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the sound of her new, deeper voice she stopped and put her hands to her throat. She could feel her Adam's apple and the hair of her beard, reminding her why she sounded so strange. Taking a deep breath she was able to continue, &quot;If we're careful we can get to my house without being seen. My parents and brother won't be back home until like eight anyway so we'll have time to figure out what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Already beginning to recover, Tiff was able to improve on the plan, &quot;The woods in the backyard should go straight to your backyard. I'm positive I know the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The left the house through a back window and ran through the woods, following thin trails, and when those faded, relying on Tiff's confidence that the way she was going was right. Tiff was every bit as good at navigating as she thought herself to be, for in less than twenty minutes they were in Katie's back yard.<br />
<br />
Once in the house they each took a shower to wash away the dust from the house and help them relax. Tiff borrowed clothes from Katie and Katie put on jeans and a t-shirt that she got from her brother's room.<br />
<br />
Washed and dressed they sat down together in the living room and waited for Katie's parents to arrive. Tiffany had already called her own parents and said that there was a possibility she might spend the night with Katie. Katie was glad for this, since she needed her friend more now than ever before. While waiting she couldn't help but fidget, adjusting her borrowed shirt over her chest. Seeing this Tiff spoke to her, &quot;Is everything alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Katie blushed slightly, &quot;I just feel so naked without a bra. I know I can't use one anymore, not that I need to, but still...&quot;<br />
<br />
At a quarter after eight Katie's family arrived home and were understandably alarmed to see a friend of their daughter's and an unknown young man sitting in their living room.<br />
<br />
Katie was quick to speak, before things got ugly. She and Tiff had spent the better part of the evening planning what they were going to say, &quot;Mom, dad, Evan, it's me Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very quickly, so as to prevent her family from having a chance to ask questions until it was all over, Katie and Tiffany told the story of their entering the house and what happened afterward.<br />
<br />
After hearing the story her parents looked shocked and angry as thought they thought it all to be some sort of sick joke. Her brother, Evan, was smirking slightly, &quot;I know how to prove they're making this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a step toward Katie, &quot;If you think you're Katie tell me what happened to the fish dad won for you at the carnival when you were five.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie blushed furiously, &quot;I named him 'Mr. Binky Fishy' and when he died three days later I had a funeral for him and dad made him a coffin and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother started to cry, her father wore an unreadable expression and Evan began to laugh, &quot;I can't believe it! You really are Katie and I can't believe you remember the name of that dumb fish!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was too much for Katie to handle. Standing up and completely forgetting about her new muscles, she pushed her brother out of the way hard enough to send him sprawling on the flood then stormed up to her room, crying the whole time.</p>
