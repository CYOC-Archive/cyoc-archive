<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marco had just left the locker room and he was walking over to the pool when all his teammates on the swim team were staring at him and no wonder. Marco was extremely muscular so his friends were obviously wondering how he was going to swim with all that muscle on his body? <br />
<br />
But Marco was grinning the whole time as he was constantly overcome with the urge to flex. His friends gasped every time Marco made a fist and raised up his arm, causing a massive bicep to pop up on his arm, with a huge rock hard tricep hanging underneath. Truly, his arm looked like it had a bowling ball implanted inside of it. It had one large mass of muscle that just appeared to be growing every time he flexed his arm. <br />
<br />
Obviously, Marco wasn’t aware of the fact that Ty had quietly wished for his muscles to get bigger every time he changed from swimmer back to his normal, bodybuilder self!<br />
<br />
So, as soon as Marco approached the large swimming pool while wearing only his black Speedo, his body started to stretch! He grew longer and taller as he started to smell the strong odor of chlorine from the swimming pool. His arms and legs grew a foot longer, as well as his torso. His muscles shrunk as he became a bit lankier, transforming into a boy with the perfect body for a swimmer. With long arms, long legs, big feet the size of flippers and large hands with long fingers, he looked like he was ready for the Olympics. <br />
<br />
He stood on his platform and dove into the pool at the sound of the buzzer, swimming his laps as the coach instructed. He did that for about two hours until he was done, climbing out of the pool by way of the ladder by the side. Once he was done, he showered off and walked into the locker room where he took a shower.<br />
<br />
Once he dried off, Marco was overcome by that tingling sensation again. Unaware of his invisible visitor at the time, Ty was standing there, watching his handiwork as Marco started to shrink back. <br />
<br />
Marco’s body shrunk by a whole foot in height until he was a little bit on the short side, the same height as Ty. At the same time, his muscles started to blow up, inflating rapidly like helium balloon, quickly changing the wereswimmer back into a young, hulking muscle boy. This time, however, Marco would become even BIGGER than he was previously. <br />
<br />
His shoulders widened like crazy, stretching out wider and wider as his pecs grew into massive spheres of large muscle, supported underneath my huge, wide lats. His arms were sticking out like an NFL linebacker! The only difference was, he wasn’t even wearing any pads or a harness! Mighty abdominal muscles formed over his stomach as his biceps inflated into large balls of muscle, even bigger than they were before! <br />
<br />
His legs became massive as his quads became giant pillars of thick muscle cords, wider than his body and his calves filled up until they were bigger than basketballs!<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Marco gasped, admiring his physique in the mirror. “Why do I look bigger every time I change?” <br />
<br />
“You’re a growing boy, dude!” Ty grinned, appearing before him with a smile on his face. <br />
<br />
“Ty! Why are my muscles so… HUGE!” Marco wondered, as he flexed again.<br />
<br />
“Dude… Because they are YOU! You look great with big muscles. They are so YOU!” Ty smiled. “Your body is made to hold huge muscles.” <br />
<br />
“But my shoulders are so… wide! I can barely fit through the door!!” Marco sighed. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry… Just walk sideways! And, wear sporty clothes!” Ty grinned, snapping his fingers. Marco was blinded by a flash of light when he was suddenly wearing high tops, Lycra shorts, a tank top and a bandana over his forehead. “I’ll help you!” <br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Marco gasped. “I look like a jock!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, and you flex all the time and people will just LOVE to rub your giant muscles!” Ty laughed. ”Your muscles will get bigger every time you get out of the pool! Now, go show off your muscles to your fans, who are ALL the kids in school!” <br />
<br />
Ty snapped his fingers and Marco disappeared. <br />
<br />
Marco popped up in the hallway of school where he got mobbed by his classmates who were all running towards him as Marco had a strong urge to flex both arms. Then, his classmates all fought over their turn to run their hands over Marco’s bulging muscles as Marco just stood there, maintaining his flex while Ty looked on and grinned as he admired his handiwork. Marco was the most popular kid in school…</p>
