<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ted grunted and held in his cries of pain. He was going to take this like a man. For a good thirty minutes the pair fucked and then Smokey exploded inside of Ted. Ted felt the warm rush within his guts and the thoughts of what he was to become alone caused his cock to spew out gobs of thick cum. Ted realized, though, that he did enjoy the experience and looked forward to being mated when he too was a bearman. Smokey eased himself down onto Ted and pulled his arms and legs next to Ted’s naked body, covering him in a blanket of his own fur. Ted felt the bear’s hard cock still deep inside of him and the warmth of the bearman’s sperm was spreading out from Ted’s guts. <br />
<br />
Ted felt his balls begin to tingle, pleasantly. He sighed, smiled and began to doze, thinking about the furry body he’d soon have and how nice Smokey smelled.<br />
<br />
When Ted awoke he itched all over and his cock ached with how large it was and now much his balls needed to be emptied.  He squirmed a bit and Smokey pulled out of him.  He flipped over and Smokey immediately began to lick Ted’s face.  Ted scratched the itchier parts of his body as Smokey nuzzled his neck.<br />
<br />
“I’m so horny,” Ted said, “I feel like I’m holding back a flood of come.”<br />
<br />
Smokey ceased nuzzling momentarily and asked, “What’s horny?  You mean like the deer?”<br />
<br />
“No, it means I want to mate with you.” Ted said, <br />
<br />
Smokey smiled and began licking down Ted’s now furry chest.  He moved down to Ted’s cock.  Ted was only slightly distracted by the changes he was going through, he could feel his face changing and his hands and feet felt like they were swelling.  He could see in the dim light from the lamp left outside of the tent that his nose was now blackened and that his face was beginning to push out into the short muzzle Smokey and the other bearmen had.  His teeth were falling out and he’d spit a few out as they fell into his mouth.  He could feel new bear teeth pushing through.  Smokey suckled Ted and it felt really wonderful, but Ted wanted something else.<br />
<br />
“Smokey,”  Ted said as he scratched at the fur on his face, “can I mate with you the way you mated with me earlier?”<br />
<br />
Smokey came off of Ted’s cock and smiled broadly.  “Yes, Dick and Ron have both mated with me and it seems right that you should too; I like to share.”<br />
<br />
With that, Smokey positioned himself and Ted climbed on top of the great bearman.  Ted’s cock was huge.  It had grown to at least ten inches and was thick and wrapped in bulging blue veins.  He noticed as he stroked himself into full hardness that it was becoming a different shape too.  The head was less helmet shaped and was more of a mushroom cap.  He also noticed a slight bulge in the middle.  Being a biology major, it didn’t surprise Ted, he knew dogs and wolves had knots that expanded in their cocks and bears and wolves came from the same distant ancestor.  He stroked and watched his cock grow another inch before Smokey interrupted with a clearing of his throat and a look back that said, “What are you waiting for?”<br />
<br />
With that, Ted gently began to work his cock into Smokey’s ass.  Smokey moaned as the bulge pushed past his asshole.  Ted felt the incredible heat and he could hold his animal instincts back no longer.  Ted began to grunt and growl like a bear and as he humped, each growl grew deeper and more ursine in sound.  Within minutes, Ted’s balls were emptying themselves of the last of Ted’s human sperm, but Ted was far from finished fucking.  Changes increased in tempo as Ted began to feel the full strength and power of his growing body.  Fur lengthened, claws pushed out of his paw/hands and feet.  Ted felt the rounding of his belly and briefly thought about why bears had big bellies; they were omnivores and needed more intestinal length to digest plant matter than their distant wolf cousins who were carnivores.  That was the last human thought Ted has as he mentally shifted and sunk deeper into the animal he was becoming.  Ted reached down with his new muzzle and new fangs and grabbed hold of the back of Smokey’s furry neck.  Bear fucking became his entire focus as his form finished filling out into its full ursine size and shape.  Ted released his hold on his mate’s neck and roared as came deep inside of Smokey.  Just slightly after, Smokey roared out his own orgasm, the fifth or sixth he’d had today with his new mates.  He’d had more sex today than all of last breeding season.<br />
<br />
Smokey thought, as he finished pumping out his seed and Ted collapsed onto him that it must be because he was now part human.  He’d become a social bear.  It had become easy for him to be with other males like himself.  Bears aren’t social, but humans are and that must be why he felt no need to distance himself from other male bearmen, as a normal bear would distance himself from another competing male.<br />
<br />
The two bearmen lay with each other, Ted occasionally grunting as Smokey stretched or scratched.  Ted was still buried deep inside of Smokey’s ass and when his mate moved, it felt wonderful.  He petted his new lover with his clawed hands and scratched his ears.  This brought grunts of pleasure from Smokey.<br />
<br />
Finally, the two separated.<br />
<br />
“I’m hungry as a bear!”  Ted said and laughed at both the statement and his deeper voice.<br />
<br />
“We could forage.”  Smokey said.  “I’ll show you were to find food.”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps in the morning,” Ted said, “for now, there’s a cooler full of sandwiches and drinks that we can have.”<br />
<br />
In the next fifteen minutes, Ted and Smokey emptied the cooler of about two dozen sandwiches and a six pack of sodas each.  They also ate a dozen eggs and the two packs of sausage raw.  The finished it off by drinking the gallon of milk between them.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, the two bearmen sat and waited for Dick and Ron to come back.  Finally, after about a half an hour, Ted decided he’d had enough.  He talked Smokey into following Dick and Ron; he could smell the smoke from the accident and knew, generally, which direction to head.  Ted realized that now, as a bearman, his outdoor skills would improve drastically.  Ted and Smokey headed out of camp and through the forest, closely by the road.  They crossed the road and went down to the creek.  Ted could smell the smoke a little stronger and up ahead he heard voices.<br />
<br />
Smokey whispered in his ear, “Dick said to stay hidden.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” Ted whispered back, “Let’s just get closer.”<br />
<br />
The moon was full and directly overhead.  It lit the scene by the creek well.  From the woods near what looked like a burned out Jeep Ted could see his buddies.  He saw Carl standing next to Dick or Ron, he couldn’t tell and the other two were seated on a log talking.  They were talking with a rather interesting collection of animorphs.  Ted saw a boar-man and apparently the boar-man’s mate.  He saw two stag-men, one a nice regular brown and one a very unusual black with silver on its muzzle and the black stag-man had his arm around a doe-woman, protectively.  The other stag stood just behind him with his hand on the black stag’s shoulder as they listened to the conversation.  Ted saw wolves, raccoons and he saw what looked like a squirrel.  He motioned Smokey to come closer and he whispered in the bear’s ear.<br />
<br />
“I think we should go join the group, they seem to be discussing something important.  I also recognize three of my friends there and I need to let them know what’s happened to me so they don’t panic.  After all, I don’t exactly look the way I did two hours ago.”<br />
<br />
Carefully, the two bearmen approached the circle of animorphs.  As they approached, Ted could tell the conversation was about what to do next, something in his youthful hurry to become a bearman he hadn’t considered.  At about twenty feet from the circle, the assembled group noticed them.  The boar-man turned, grunted and said, “Welcome, my misfit brothers, come join out discussion.  We have a future to plan.”</p>
