<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jule stopped at the surf line his toes within inches of the ocean water, the water had turned into a glowing neon blue and even without touching it he could feel the warmth of the ocean before him. It was a stark contrast to the howling wind and bone chilling rain which he was currently dealing with. He turned to look back his friends where still asleep within the hovel they had made, they had to be as cold as he was, but their strength hadn’t left them. They weren’t at the point of surrendering their humanity…he was. <br />
<br />
He looked down at his feet one last time and stepped into the water, the water was warm and seamed to pull him out to sea ever so gently. Whitney had moved out to sea a good 12 or 15 feet and was awaiting him. The water around him was glowing but beyond the glowing water the ocean was still turning from the storm. <br />
<br />
It was when the water was about waist high that he felt his legs give out, they had turned numb, and he fell forward into the water. He had expected the water to be breathable but it wasn’t and so he instantly felt like he was drowning. He did feel it was multiple of Whitney’s tentacles wrapped around him pulling him into deeper water as she went out to sea as well. Finally, she stopped and began to pull him toward her. He was near the point of blacking out as his body was lied out in Whitney’s lap.<br />
<br />
“Receive the gift of breath.” Stated Whitney as she bent down and gave him a long deep kiss, It felt as if the water in his lungs was being blown out and it was multiple slits opened around his rib cage as the water in his lungs was forced out. When Whitney finished she pulled back and he was able to breathe again.<br />
<br />
For a second he just lied there on Whitney’s lap with his whole body stretched out as Whitney’s tentacles moved around him. He felt two of them head toward his face, he still couldn’t move but he was at least breathing again. <br />
<br />
“Receive the gift of a new body.” proclaimed Whitney as her tentacles began to glow and he felt them press against his body and where they did it was as if his skin, muscles and bones had turned to clay as they began to remold him.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be a woman…keep me a man.” whispered Jule as he discovered that while he couldn’t move he could speak.<br />
<br />
“I have no control over that.” Calmed Whitney as she kept tentacles working “Your natural soul will come out, just like Diana came out of Damon. I only guild the process a bit.”<br />
<br />
Jule’s heart sank a bit but then he noticed that the ten tentacles around his face had only remained there for a moment before moving on to his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“But you don’t have to worry about that, my son.” answered Whitney as Jule relaxed a bit, when he did he noticed his hair. He had always had longish hair for a boy, enough so that he could see his bangs had turned from a deep brown to a sort of royal blue. <br />
<br />
He felt his shoulders broaden a bit but not by much but the change he did notice was his arms, he was never a weightlifter or gym rat, he was slightly above average but not by much and he did most of his work out on a basketball court. His arms where now had clearly defined muscles but not over the top, he did wince a bit in pain as some blood entered the water as a small extendable fin grew out of his wrist and down about halfway to his elbow. It extended for a moment looking like some kind of neon blue bat wing before folding up to rest along the side of his arm. <br />
<br />
He turned his gaze down to his chest, he had gotten a lot stronger, he wouldn’t say he had a six pack or the like but it was clearly right on the edge of that. He was toner and fitter than he had ever been. He loved that, even if some scales were appearing around his bully button area. <br />
<br />
With a ripping sound Whitney pulled his swim trunks away as Jule blushed as he saw his hardened manhood. It was hard not to take note that he was lying in the embrace of a bare breasted mermaid. A tentacles wrapped around his manhood and he expected to see Whitney push his manhood down to go inside his new tail which was forming but instead she began to not only stretch it but give it a bigger girth. His eyes widened as he looked at his new member, he had always been average and if that was average for a merman it would make a horse envious. <br />
<br />
He watched as his new member pulled back into his new tail waiting to be used whenever he felt the need. His legs had been pulled out a bit as they were merged together into a single new limb. Royal blue, neon blue and a few white scales appeared on his new tail as he felt his legs come to a point at the ankle. His feet which where still human he expected to be turned horizontal to become dolphin like fins but instead were turned vertical to become a shark like fin. Using his limited motion, he noticed that a large fin had grown in his back started about where his rib and ending about where his tail bone would be if he was still human. Blue scales had moved all the way up to his shoulder blade area in the back but the rest was still human.<br />
<br />
“Nearly done.”  Said Whitney, she could see that Jule now had neon blue eyes to go with his blue hair. She pulled his face closer to her bare breast. “Receive the gift of knowledge.”<br />
<br />
Suckling on Whitney’s tit and drinking her milk wasn’t something he wanted but in the end the milk tasted so good, and he had gone so long without much food at all. With each drop he gained new knowledge of the world and his place within it. He didn’t get everything he would still have much to learn but he wasn’t starting at zero anymore. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to the Sea, Jule.” Said Whitney as a newly merman Jule looked at his body as he floated in the water, the water was turning back to normal but it was still a lot nicer down here then the surface.<br />
<br />
“Thanks…this feels nice, weird but nice.” Said Jule<br />
<br />
“Give it some time, do you want me to take you to Diana?” inquired Whitney<br />
<br />
“No…it is what 3 or 4 am?” inquired Jule, Whitney nodded her head in conformation. “I didn’t sleep at all on the surface and this transformation…”<br />
<br />
“Makes you sore.” Confirmed Whitney “If you want, you can rest in the sands here, I want to remain here in case one of your friends follows your lead. If they don’t by morning we will go see Diana.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Jule as he moved off a bit and came to a rest on the soft sand, it was much warmer and far more comfortable then the surface and sleep took him quickly even as he wondered what was next.</p>
