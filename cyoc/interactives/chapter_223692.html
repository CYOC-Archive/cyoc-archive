<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What the fuck are you talking about?” Mark reddened further, sweating, absolutely terrified. His eyes widened. “What’s... my... where am I? What is this place?”<br />
<br />
“Jackass.” Ty urged.<br />
<br />
“What did you c----AWWWWW!” Mark suddenly brayed, staggering and suddenly trembling as transformation took him.<br />
<br />
The change was grotesque and terrifying. Unlike the pleasant erotic changes of June and the giraffes, Ty made sure that Mark’s verged on pure body horror. Bones snapped, flesh pulled. Mark screamed and twisted in agony, especially as his spine elongated above his ass. The poor soon-to-be donkey writhed and fell to all fours. He was crying, the pain was intense, and as his body changed shape he drooled and brayed helplessly.<br />
<br />
His hands shook as they turned to solid hooves. He scream-brayed as his ankles snapped up at a sharp angle and the bone began to reform. As his face began to stretch and the needlepoints of hairs emerged on bare skin and thickened what was already there, Mark managed to open his eyes wide in terror and saw first hand what was happening. He brayed and screamed, scooting back on his hind legs as if fleeing his own transformation.<br />
<br />
With the final cracks, his posture losing all sense of humanity as he fully converted to a quadruped, and his fur growing in, the pot-bellied old donkey’s expression was utter humiliation as he realized the state he was in and the impossible but clearly happening reality of his circumstance.<br />
<br />
Donkey Mark trembled in horror as he stood for the first time on all four legs, tentatively trying to walk and staggering drunkenly. He turned his head to regard Ty in complete distress, chest heaving, ears back, and let out a pathetic whine.<br />
<br />
“You should have picked something you’d like,” Ty shrugged.<br />
<br />
Mark simply stared back, his eyes mournful, and the full reality and helplessness of his position sunk in fully. He nodded sheepishly, unable to speak in return, and back away nervously as Ty stood up.<br />
<br />
“I can do anything now,” Ty whispered, stepping over to a shaking Mark and placing a hand on his back. “And while deep down I want to punish you and hurt you for all that you did to me, I can’t harm such a cute ass.”<br />
<br />
Mark’s eyes widened, his jaw dropped, and Ty chuckled as he touched the donkey’s flank. Mark’s tail raised in alarm and he brayed.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Ty reassured him. “Don’t be scared. Yes, you’re a donkey now. I made you that way. And I can make you many other things. Some of them can be scary. Some of them can feel good. And if you’re a good little boy and listen, maybe I’ll make you a man again. Although... maybe not...” Ty smirked deviously. “You got it?”<br />
<br />
Mark’s body language sunk and he audibly gulped. He nodded gently, scared, and his eyes found Ty’s. Ty saw the pleading. The uncertainty. The sheer terror.<br />
<br />
“How helpless you feel right now. How scared. How uncertain. That’s how you made me feel for nearly a decade of my life.”<br />
<br />
Tears began to form. Mark understood. He brayed mournfully.<br />
<br />
“Do you feel bad?” Ty whispered, stroking the animal’s back and neck.<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, grimacing.<br />
<br />
“Good boy,” Ty said, rubbing the donkey’s stiff mane. “That means there’s still a little humanity left in you after all. Now... you’re a little big right now. Let’s fix that.”<br />
<br />
Mark gulped again, unsure of what Ty meant, and gasped as he felt energy coursing through him.<br />
<br />
Shrinking. Size change. No matter how times Ty had done it now, it never ceased to be erotic. The donkey had no sooner gotten used to being a donkey than he was now being confronted by the world growing massive around him.<br />
<br />
Mark let out a bray, glanced around frantically, and Ty giggled as his animal voice raised to a squeaky pitch, his brays becoming cuter and cuter. About a foot tall, he stopped.<br />
<br />
Ty knelt down beside the shocked and absolutely horrified Mark and reached for him. Mark saw the giant hands approaching him, screeched, and make a break for it, pumping his back legs and his plump thighs for all they were worth. From Ty’s perspective, he laughed in mirth as the little donkey tried to escape, floundering on the hardwood floor as Ty easily grabbed him around the back and belly.<br />
<br />
As Ty picked Mark up the donkey kicked and tried to run feverishly, eyes shut in horror, his heart thundering.<br />
<br />
“Easy, little guy. Easy,” Ty reassured.<br />
<br />
He cradled the donkey into his elbow and against his chest, holding him on his back with his legs flailing. Eventually, breathing heavily, Mark opened his eyes and went still. His animal expression was mortified. His mouth was open, his eyes were teared up, his body was trembling.<br />
<br />
“Now...” Ty whispered, running a finger over Mark’s donkey chest and over his tender soft belly. The donkey’s eyes widened, his back legs tensed. “If you’re a good little toy I’ll reward you. If you’re naughty, I’ll make you play with me and you won’t like it. Understand?”<br />
<br />
Mark gasped, nodded slowly, and he hesitantly fell still.<br />
<br />
“That’s a good boy,” Ty praised. “You know, you’ve got a great big donkey dick between your legs now,” Ty whispered gently. He could positively see the horrified realization on Mark’s face. “It would be a shame not to use it, huh?”<br />
<br />
The donkey shifted, glanced down his round belly, and opened his back legs. Partly in fear, partly in curiosity.<br />
<br />
“Ahhh, there’s a good little boy!” Ty grinned. “You’re learning so fast. And don’t worry, there’s no shame. I just want to make you feel good. And you can make me feel good in return. So much more fun than petty revenge. We can be pals, right?”<br />
<br />
Mark gulped again, closed his eyes, and resigned himself to it. He nodded solemnly. Okay, he was saying, I get it.<br />
<br />
“Whatever you have to do to get your humanity back, right?” Ty smiled, standing up and carrying the still panting donkey to his plush king sized bed.<br />
<br />
Ty lowered them onto the bed and laid on his stomach, setting his shrunken and donkified step dad down on all fours and letting him get his balance on the soft mattress.<br />
<br />
“Just relax,” Ty said gently, stroking the animal’s plump rear with his palm. “Think of tall pretty girls with big breasts if you want. I want you to get hard.”<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath, which sounded adorable at his tiny size, and Ty watched with excitement. This WAS so much better than revenge!</p>
