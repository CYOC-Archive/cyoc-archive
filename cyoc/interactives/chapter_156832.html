<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">2020 in Animalia was not quite starting of with a bang, but not with a whimper either. There were many Animalians who were writing letters to themselves in the future telling themselves about what had happened to them in 2019 and intended not to be sent to them until seven years later. While it wasn&#39;t like a time capsule, it was similar and there were many who were doing it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
While it was a little surprising that Miss Fabina would &quot;move in&quot; and overhaul Animalia&#39;s entire adult entertainment, she was doing a good job at it and had established contacts with all the current Animalia colonies. She also had a special role as a consultant both for adult entertainment stars who wanted to join and girls who were a little confusing about their reasons for joining.<br />
<br />
Miss Fabina was just wrapping up her latest song at the Kat&#39;s Klub when Scala showed up with a series of folders for the latest recruits.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who are the latest applicants?&quot; asked Miss Fabina. Scala handed each file over to her to review and each one was interesting enough to waive at least half their conversion fees.<br />
<br />
The first one she reviewed was a Japanese girl named Naomi who was suffering from gigantism. She was a little indecisive about what she wanted to be, but there was clear evidence that, while she did want some mass to balance her out,  she didn&#39;t want to be an animal known for height (such as giraffes) or weight (such as cows or hippos).<br />
<br />
The next one was another Japanese girl who was recorded as suffering from myostatin-related hypertrophy. It was clear that she was having trouble controlling her strength, according to some of the photos that showed destroyed cabinets, doors, etc.. Another thing that was in her file was the fact that her &quot;tomboy&quot; personality tended to intimidate a lot of boys, whether intentionally or not.<br />
<br />
The third file featured yet another Japanese girl named Honoka who was suffering from macromastia. While it wasn&#39;t as bad as Jen&#39;s was before her conversion, it was still easy to see that they were causing a number on her back. Jen was sympathetic to her, and was able to get her sponsorship to offset some of the costs. She was also requesting not to be a cow or similar Animalians, which was a little understandable. Her file also showed that she was a member of her school&#39;s archery club, and had won three annual archery tournaments in a row despite her &quot;burden&quot;, but still had trouble getting people to take her seriously.<br />
<br />
The fourth file was that of a girl named Alice who had, as one rude frat boy had said, &quot;spun the beauty lottery and was one off on every number&quot;. Her photo showed that the claim was somewhat accurate, because she had clear skin, blonde hair, pale blue eyes, but a bad case of obesity. According to the enclosed medical report, she was suffering from a moderate leptin deficiency, and while it wasn&#39;t as bad as Martha&#39;s, it was clear that she needed this. Martha was able to get her sponsorship, and was more than happy to help her choose a species.<br />
<br />
The final file was of a girl named Aida who, surprisingly, was rescued by Ammy from a pimp during the Harpin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, which she had been asked to &quot;preside&quot; at. Said pimp didn&#39;t take Ammy seriously, and ended up in jail after Ammy slapped him silly with her 9-section whip chain before handing him over to authorities. Afterward, Ammy was able to get Aida into Project Cameron. What was clear was that Aida was suffering from crippling shyness rather than any physical health problems, but that was what Project Cameron was for.<br />
<br />
After Miss Fabina reviewed the files, she was able to approve all of them. She could definitely see the potential in all of them, if not in adult entertainment.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There were also a few funny things that resulted from some people&#39;s conversions. One such thing was when Jen and Andrew were skyping with Jen&#39;s parents about meeting up with them for Chinese New Year. While Jen&#39;s parents didn&#39;t have any real problems with her new species, Jen&#39;s grandma (the one who claimed that she had been cursed by a cow demon), who didn&#39;t speak much English pitched a small fit. While the video of the fit did end up in the hands of internet trolls who created all kinds of fabricated &quot;translations&quot; about what the fit was about, the actual translation (posted by a professional translator and linguist) was considered the funniest.<br />
<br />
But perhaps what was considered &quot;standard&quot; for Animalia was the large number of people in &quot;drunk tanks&quot; due to the New Year Celebrations.</p>
