<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now, there was something about the necklace that the shop owner had left sort of vague. Nothing bad, just confusing. She’d said that if a the wearer touched a piece of clothing, they would turn into a likely wearer of those clothes. She didn’t mean they would turn into a clone of the owner, just a similar but different person suited to those clothes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Timothy wore the necklace home to keep it safe. He entered the house and locked the door. His family was away on vacation; he’d had the misfortune to get sick right before they left early this morning, and of course as soon as they left he felt fine. His parents had asked his brother Daniel’s girlfriend, Penny, to come over to check on him once every day and generally house-sit if Timothy wasn’t up to it.<br />
<br />
Timothy walked up the stairs, seeing that Daniel had dropped a sweaty orange dri-fit tank top on the floor. Pinching his nose against the smell, Timothy gingerly picked it up and threw it in the laundry. He groaned at what a pig Daniel was. Just because he was tired from lifting or sports practice didn’t mean he couldn’t walk a few more feet to throw his clothes in the laundry!<br />
<br />
Little did Timothy realize he’d activated the necklace. He suddenly felt very drowsy, so he stumbled to his room and fell asleep on top of the bed.<br />
<br />
As he slept, he changed. He grew much taller, over 6 feet. His brown hair turned black as midnight, and his skin a bronze shade. His face reformed into the image of a chiseled teen, maybe 17, with light black stubble on his cheeks. His neck thickened, giving him a deep voice. His muscles bulged and swelled everywhere, growing to Adonis-like proportions. Pecs like plates of armor the size of watermelons, biceps like softballs but hard as rock, 8 abs looking like they’d been cut with diamond, legs like Greek pillars: everything impressed. His baby dick grew like an anaconda until it was a foot long and thick as a Coke can (hard), and his balls swelled to the size of chicken eggs. Finally, as his clothes had been utterly destroyed in his growth, new clothes formed on his body: a large jock strap, black basketball shorts that barely reached mid-thigh and an exact copy of Daniel’s orange workout tank top.<br />
<br />
Though Daniel was a bigger guy, Timothy now had him beat. The young man who now looked like a Greek god was about 6’6” and 230 pounds of pure muscle. <br />
<br />
Timothy yawned and came awake. He slowly rolled himself off the bed and to his feet, the necklace swinging as he did so. He needed to pee, so he went to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Looking down, he was startled by the sight of two huge pecs under a tight orange tank top blocking his view. He pulled down his shorts and jock strap- he’d never worn one of those!- and pulled out his enormous python to pee, again stunned by the size. When Timothy reached the mirror, he just about died on seeing his reflection. He ran his hands over his huge muscles and perfect face, not believing what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Timothy remembered the orange tank top he’d thrown into the laundry. He was wearing an identical one! The necklace had changed him, just like the shopkeeper said!<br />
<br />
Timothy took off the necklace immediately. He never wanted to change back or into anyone else. With this body, he could do anything. He could become a football star, go to the NFL. He could be a fitness model or a catalog model or a big-name Hollywood actor. The possibilities were endless!<br />
<br />
There was another thing the shopkeeper hadn’t mentioned. Those who knew Timothy already would remember him having been this way, but those who hadn’t met him would be unaffected.<br />
<br />
And now the doorbell rang. It was Penny, coming to check on the house- and a shrimp 13-year-old Timothy. <br />
<br />
Timothy went to the door and opened it. He saw Penny and his heart started pounding. Penny’s jaw dropped on seeing the huge hunk answer the door. She collected herself and asked, “Who are you?”<br />
<br />
Timothy had to think fast. “Um, I’m Daniel’s cousin- George. My aunt and uncle asked me to stay here with Timothy for a few days. He’s at a friend’s house right now.”<br />
<br />
Penny raised an eyebrow. “Funny, they never mentioned you.”<br />
<br />
“It was very last minute,” Timothy lied, face flushing. <br />
<br />
Penny smiled and came inside. “You’re cute when you get worked up.”<br />
<br />
Well, the flirting continued, the flirting eventually turned into making out, and soon Timothy was lying naked in his parents’ bed next to Penny, realizing he’d just seduced and had sex with his brother’s girlfriend.</p>
