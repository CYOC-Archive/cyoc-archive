<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick was considering the pics of a few of the guys that messaged him when Anthony actually got back to him.<br />
<br />
&#39;Not on text, meet me in your car in ten.&#39;<br />
<br />
Nick blinked a little at that message but sent back a confirmation. A few minutes later he was wandering down to his car on the street and hopping inside. He jumped slightly as the other door opened allowing in Anthony. He was still sporting the extra muscle from yesterday, making his clothes particularly tight, but had shaved his beard off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed a rule.&quot; Anthony said, settling in. &quot;Don&#39;t text or write down stuff about us.&quot; He took Jason&#39;s phone in hand and deleted the last couple of messages with a shake of his head. &quot;Sorry, I wasn&#39;t completely sober last night. If you need me just ask to meet up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d you get here so fast?&quot; Nick said, looking around. In response Anthony pointed down the street. &quot;I live in one of the nearby houses, I&#39;m studying at the law school. So what&#39;s this about healing fast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say I wanted to add a piercing or tattoos? Can I.. speed up the recovery?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anthony nodded. &quot;Yeah. Try to avoid being obvious about it. People will accept some pretty wild personality changes, but make physical changes too obvious and people will notice. Like I said, small changes. That shouldn&#39;t be too bad though, I&#39;ve done it a few times myself, especially when I was about to change bodies, leave a farewell tattoo. What did you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick blushed a little. &quot;Nipple rings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anthony just grinned devilishly. &quot;Got time now? Buckle up, I know just the place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick hesitated for only a moment, then started his car. Anthony gave him some directions to a piercing and tattoo parlor in town. Anthony gave his shoulder an encouraging squeeze and they stepped inside. The place was currently empty except for a heavily tattooed woman who sat behind the counter messing around on a computer. Nick had never seen her before, but something about her felt oddly familiar, like he should know her. She looked up as they entered and squinted at Anthony. &quot;Travis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthony, at the moment.&quot; She nodded, then looked at Nick. &quot;I don&#39;t know him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, he&#39;s new.&quot; Anthony said. &quot;Jason, this is Lee, she&#39;s like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s uh, Nick, actually.&quot; Nick said with a smile and a wave to Lee.<br />
<br />
Anthony frowned. &quot;I keep forgetting you&#39;re new. Usually, it&#39;s best to go by your body&#39;s name, even try to think of yourself by that name. Causes less confusion in the memories and helps them settle in better. And keeps you from slipping up in public.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Christ, Anthony.&quot; Lee said, eyeing Jason up and down. &quot;How fresh is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night.&quot; Anthony said, trying to brush aside any awkwardness there. Lee just frowned and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ve been watching him for a while though, I think he&#39;ll be a good addition to the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you didn&#39;t just stop by to show off your new apprentice, what do you want?&quot; Lee was brusque, but not exactly rude. There was a small smile on her face as she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nipple piercings.&quot; Nick spoke up, if he was the one getting them, he was the one going to ask.<br />
<br />
Lee suddenly looked eager. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to like this fish I think if he&#39;s already willing to try that.&quot; She motioned for him to step into the back and then over to one of the chairs. &quot;Shirt off.&quot; Nick complied, removing his shirt as he set on the chair which made him recline backwards, the leather was cool on his back. Anthony sat on a chair nearby, looking at Jason&#39;s chest a bit hungrily. Lee got a few things ready, giving Nick a sampling or rings to chose from. He pointed at a pair of thick steel rings with beads at the bottom. &quot;This is going to hurt, and with how new you are it&#39;s still going to take you a few weeks to heal up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take care of that.&quot; Anthony said. Lee&#39;s eyebrows went up but she nodded. The next handful of minutes were some of the most uncomfortable of Nick&#39;s life, Jason&#39;s knot of emotions brought up the memory of a broken leg when he was a kid he remembered hurting worse. But soon he sat there with twin pads on his chest.<br />
<br />
Anthony came into view, still sitting in one of the rolling chairs. &quot;Okay, we&#39;re going to need to swap for a hot second. Concentrate on me, feel yourself start to drift in my direction, let go of Jason and..&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick felt a moment of dizziness as he lost perspective from Jason, then everything snapped back into place and he was looking down at Jason. He was Anthony. He could feel a different bottle of emotions and memories in the back of his mind this one was more relaxed, content. It was an odd experience.<br />
<br />
Jason hissed softly. &quot;Why do I always forget how much that hurts. Give me a few moments.&quot; He scrunched his brows a bit as he laid back. &quot;Wow. You&#39;ve already done a number in here kid. I can feel the changes settling in. Sexuality shifting slightly, a little bit of an exhibitionism habit forming, less angry, a little more flirtatious. Not bad for less than a day&#39;s work. You might be a natural at this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can tell?&quot; Nick asked, Anthony&#39;s softer tones coming from him seeming odd in his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus on that chunk of thoughts that&#39;s Anthony. You&#39;ll see my marks. Try to read them.&quot; Jason said, lifting one of the gauze pads on his chest slightly to look.<br />
<br />
Nick did as he was told. &quot;Hmm.. yeah, I think I see.&quot; He could feel the emotions and memories, and there was a slight difference to some of them, it was subtle. &quot;You&#39;ve been making him more gay.. no, that&#39;s not right. He has been, you just pulled him out of the closet. Got him into shrooms and pot.&quot; Nick sounded amused by that. &quot;Loosened him up, he used to wear a lot of suits, was a bit high strung. He&#39;s glad you shifted his law degree to human rights.&quot; He opened his eyes and looked down at Jason. He tried to think of the body in front of him as Jason and not Anthony. He was Anthony at the moment. It was a hard thing to wrap his head around.<br />
<br />
Jason nodded, even Lee looked a little impressed. &quot;Anthony there is a son of a local minister. Very.. shall we say traditional. He was grooming Anthony to take over after him. Run his little bigot business empire. I decided to ruin those plans.&quot; Nick looked over to Lee curiously, and Jason seemed to read his mind. &quot;No, she&#39;s not doing anything but living in there. Sometimes we decide to live out a life for a while. She&#39;s been Lee for twenty years now. Eventually she&#39;ll move on, but once in a while it&#39;s nice to just be someone for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded and sat up. &quot;All done. Swap back. It&#39;ll be easier this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick nodded and after a moment his perceptions had changed again. He was back in Jason&#39;s body, which felt more comfortable to him. The pain was gone from his chest, it felt odd, but not bad. He plucked the gauze from off his nipples and brushed at them lightly to clean them off. He felt a tingle pass through him. The rings glittered on his chest under the light, but the nipples themselves looked bigger, too. Nick looked at Anthony, questioningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made them a bit bigger and more sensitive while I was at it. Small changes, but that&#39;s a fun one.&quot; Nick tugged lightly at one of the piercings and it felt wonderful, his cock twitched in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll remember it.&quot; Nick grabbed his shirt and pulled it back on. The rings made obvious imprints on the tight fabric as it stretched over Jason&#39;s pectorals, the fabric running against his more sensitive nipples sent shivers up and down his spine. He was going to need to learn to deal with that. As he walked to the front of the store, Anthony as already paying for the piercing.<br />
<br />
&quot;My treat. A welcome to the family present.&quot; Soon they were back in the car headed back to the frat.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Lee is just going to stay in that body for most of it&#39;s life? What about the person who it belonged to? I mean, slipping in for a bit to mess around then give it back seems different than taking over completely.&quot; Nick asked as he navigated through the city.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coma patients. Ever heard one of those stories of someone recovering from brain damage or a coma when they shouldn&#39;t? It&#39;s usually one of us. Empty body, other than some imprints. It&#39;s a good way to live a few decades as just a person.&quot; Anthony shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve done it a few times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about going back to being me? I mean.. Nick?&quot; <br />
<br />
Anthony looked out the window. &quot;You could. You&#39;d have to reform your body which would mean giving up the abilities you got. Then you&#39;d just be human again. I didn&#39;t really consult with you before giving you this power. We can&#39;t, gotta keep it secret. But I&#39;ve had my eye on you, you reminded me of, well, me. I figured you&#39;d stick around. It&#39;s nice to have others we can be open with, especially a student and mentor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick parked out front of the frat and got out of the car. Anthony followed. &quot;Text me if you need anything. Really. I&#39;m supposed to stick by you while you learn the ropes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I just want a hook up?&quot; Nick joked. Anthony just smiled and headed off.<br />
<br />
Nick headed back upstairs, a few of Jason&#39;s frat bros giving him odd looks. Or giving his chest odd looks. Nick winked at one of them and headed back to his room. The sun was just starting to set, it was time to decide how to spend his Saturday night.</p>
