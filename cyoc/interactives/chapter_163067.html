<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The weather today was particularly miserable. After the accident this morning, everything gradually calmed down, and my busy brain had already moved on from obsessing over the vial in my pocket. I felt the heavy rainwater seep through my clothes, turning my skin cold. I couldn’t stop shivering. Finally, after what felt like years, I saw Aaron and Lucas emerge from the fog. They’re the unlucky ones who stand on guard after us. Unlike me and Alex, they were prepared for the harsh weather. Their bodies covered in a waterproof layer, and their faces hidden with balaclavas. We rarely talk to each other during our brief exchange anyway, merely nod and move on. I could tell Alex was just as eager to get out of the rain as I was. I swear I could feel my boots filling like buckets. We nodded to the pair, before briskly making our way back to the barracks.<br />
<br />
When we opened the door, a huge wave of warmth hugged us. It felt so good to finally peel off my uniform. I changed into a vest and shorts, stuffing my uniform under my pillow without anyone noticing. Alex kept his uniform on, standing by the small furnace in the corner of our room to dry off. Then, just as we began to settle after a long day, the bell rang for dinner. We both perked up a bit. <br />
I had built up quite the appetite.<br />
<br />
After our meal, and a brief game of volleyball, when the sun had long since fallen over the horizon, the rest of the squad and I returned to our barracks. Alex exhaled deeply as he finally stripped off his uniform, until he stood only in his boxers. He’s always been an exhibitionist. Hell, if I had a body like his, I’d never wear clothes either. He stuck his hand in them confidently after he sat on his bed.<br />
<br />
Even though the barracks were incredibly tiny, it was still able to fit the entire squad. Whilst we are small in numbers, our members make up for it in size. Everyone was so tall and buff. I’m just tall. Our bunk beds were shoved together, with no space between them. I tend to roll in my sleep, and most morning I’d wake up to find myself in another guy’s bed. Their reaction would depend on the guy. Aaron sometimes pushes me either back on my bed, or on the floor. Doug would just spoon me until morning. The only open area in the room was just by the door, where a table and a cluster of chairs were clumsily strewn about beside a small furnace, which we cannot turn off. The barracks would always get so unbearably hot at night. The permanent smell of the boys’ sweat that haunted the room will follow me forever. <br />
<br />
Doug and Andy were having an arm wrestling match on the table in the corner. Andy seemed really into it. He was neither tall nor buff. Doug was clearly going easy on him. There was no way a man with biceps as big as his was gonna lose to Andy. Maybe he really was related to Arnold Schwarzenegger. He must’ve just come out of the shower, since he only wore a towel wrapped around his waist, his body dripping wet. Andy was still in his full uniform, which was odd, since his next guard shift wasn’t until tomorrow. I guess he didn’t want to make a bad first impression. <br />
I could hear he was having a conversation with Alex, and so I joined them, dragging a chair closer.<br />
<br />
“Shame about the accident. Next time you blokes need to at least peek inside.”<br />
“They’ll fire us if we do that.”<br />
“It’ll be worth it. To know what they’re doing in there. Of course, I already know.”<br />
“Here we go…”<br />
“You’re not talking about gene-“<br />
“Genetic experimentation.”<br />
“What does that even mean?”<br />
<br />
Doug swiftly ended his match with Andy, almost breaking the man’s arm in the process. He stood up to look at us with wide eyes. Now, Doug was bigger than us in almost every way. 6’5”, with an incredibly muscular body. He’d do most of the heavy lifting. Aaron said he saw Doug lift up one of the jeeps. To be honest, it would seem crazy not to believe him. The man was huge. Even though I couldn’t see much of his face behind his beard, I knew he was smiling, as he re-adjusted his towel. I noticed Andy’s eyes were fixed on his squad-mate’s rock-hard set of abs. I don’t blame him. It took me a while to get used to them too. Anyway, <br />
<br />
“Think about it. Genetics are what makes us, so what makes you think people wouldn’t want to abuse it? Like jigsaw pieces, they can mould the perfect DNA. The perfect human being.”<br />
“If they wanted the perfect human being then here I am.”<br />
<br />
Doug roared with laughter as Alex flexed one of his biceps. He still had his other hand in his boxers, playfully rubbing his junk. Just then, a smaller man with an extremely tight, but clean, uniform swung open the barracks doors. He carried a clipboard, which he held over his crotch. He and Doug exchanged a quick glance before he addressed the rest of us.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Lights out in 5 boys. Better finish up what you’re doing.”<br />
“Roger, thanks Josh.”<br />
<br />
Doug winked at the man, who quickly left. I went to my bed to get my uniform ready for tomorrow. Without the other two seeing, I discreetly took the vial out of the pocket, and shoved it into my pillowcase. Andy stood up, grabbing a small bag from under his bed.<br />
<br />
“Do you know where the bathroom it?”<br />
“Yeah it’s down there, just where those flags are.”<br />
“Thanks.”<br />
<br />
Doug let out a huge sigh when Andy timidly left the room. I overheard the men’s conversation. They were talking quietly.<br />
<br />
“Poor bloke. I love the man, but he’s gonna need to adjust.”<br />
“They don’t teach you everything at the academy.”<br />
“Yeah. Hey, what are you doing?”<br />
“Sorry man, I just feel so pent up. Gotta get over Emily somehow.”<br />
“Dude, if you wanna jack off then just jack off. I do it all the time.”<br />
“Really?”<br />
“Yeah. You just gotta learn to not give a fuck what people think.”<br />
“I dunno….”<br />
“Give it some thought it, alright? You’ll feel a whole lot better when you let it all out.”<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Andy came back fully dressed in striped pyjamas. I watched as Doug lifted him onto the top bunk. The huge man then removed his towel. I hated it when he slept naked, mainly because he was the guy I would usually roll into during my sleep. The bed above me creaked as Alex climbed on top. The lights to the barracks turned off after a few minutes, as only the flickering flames of the furnace was left. I waited, wide-eyed, for everyone to fall asleep. I think I waited for about an hour. Doug’s loud snoring was the all-clear. I reached into the pillow to grab the vial. The warm glow of the furnace shone onto the bottle. Even though the label was hard to read, I could make out a few bits and pieces of the text. Most of it was torn off.<br />
<br />
“XT_______atch: 170. WARNING:_______POTENT.________WITH CAUTION.”<br />
<br />
None of it made sense. It didn’t stop me from carefully removing the lid. A puff of purple smoke shot from the vial, and traveled upwards. I kept my head away from the smoke. If it was toxic or something, I didn’t want to put it in my body. Then, my bed began to shake slightly. I tried to quickly put the lid back on the vial, but it was too late. The sudden motion of the bed caused a drop of the vial to fly out, and land on my neck. <br />
<br />
“Fuck!”, I thought. “I’m dead.”<br />
<br />
I noticed the shaking of the bed was coming from the bunk above me. Alex’s soft, low grunts fell into my ears, as the bed shook even more. His pair of boxers dropped to the floor. Was he jerking off? A stifled moan confirmed my suspicions. It was an unspoken rule that we’d do that in the showers. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t just tell him to knock it off. How awkward would that have bee? So instead I lay there, trying to ignore my friend’s deep exhales as he pumped his meat. Listening to his ripped body writhe about in pleasure triggered something within me. All I could think about was his ass in those boxers, and his bright, blue eyes. Fuck, he was so cute. Wait, was I getting turned on? It must be the heat. I felt a tingling sensation in my crotch, but as I looked down to see my dick harden in my shorts, I noticed something else.<br />
<br />
It had grown a couple of inches, and my balls were definitely taking up more space. All I could do was stare at my now 9-inch tent. My mind raced as it throbbed. Alex sounded like he was getting close to finishing, as I could feel the bed shake even more. I was surprised everyone was still asleep.<br />
<br />
Then, I felt the same tingling sensation run across my entire body. My muscles somehow expanded in my clothes! The serum wasn’t made to kill. In fact, quite the opposite. My vest began to ride up my stomach, and my shorts grew tighter my the second. Feeling my body grow; it’s an experience I can’t quite describe. It felt good though, like a tsunami of testosterone was flooding my veins. The sudden urge to join Alex and jack off too was overwhelming, and so I quickly whipped my throbbing cock out of my shorts and began pumping it. <br />
<br />
Holy shit, that was probably the best wank I’ve ever had. The entire time my body was met with wave upon wave of pleasure. It didn’t take much for me to cum. It felt like I hadn’t jerked off in years. Just as I finished, I knew Alex did too, as we both let out a quiet moan. I was taken aback by my slightly deeper voice. I didn’t think that far ahead, as when I came I shot my load everywhere. Alex’s seed rained down from above, our dicks acting like sprinklers. One of my loads even shot onto Doug’s abs, which moved up and down in time with snoring. Alex was asleep pretty quickly after he finished, leaving me to lie on my bed, with a bead of sweat trickling down my neck. I was breathing heavily from the excitement of it all.<br />
<br />
It was amazing. All I could do was admire my new form. I think I grew a few inches too, and as I looked at the vial, I knew exactly what they’re working on. I couldn’t believe I jerked off to a dude. I couldn’t believe I jerked off to Alex. However, that was the least of my worries. How was I gonna clean everything up?<br />
<br />
“Fuck it.”<br />
<br />
I thought, as I joined the rest of my squad, and fell asleep, my legs spread wide across my mattress. Tomorrow was going to be an interesting day.</p>
