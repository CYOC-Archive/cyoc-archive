<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger did as he had promised and called then his preferred veterinarian Mary Merry, asking of her to come to his Trotter farm and test one of his animals for being pregnant. Mary was nearby and arrived an hour after she took the phone call of Roger requesting she come to his farm. As it happened the jennet Mable tested positive on the pregnancy test. As Roger heard the results he walked toward the stall where a nervous and still horny Elroy stood sporting a full-blown donkey Jack erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dirty bastard,&quot; Roger yelled at what was his son then in a different species and form.<br />
<br />
Mary came to stand and look at what Roger seemed so outraged by, as seeing then the young male donkey spew a load of his semen into the straw bedding, she rushed to gather a sample before it could congeal or dry.<br />
<br />
&quot;We shall see if he is the sire to the jennet bred foal, I have a D.N.A. testing apparatus in my truck and can offer proof if the young Jack is to blame.&quot; Mary said as she with her surgical gloves on each hand did slop the spent semen onto a glass microscope slide. <br />
<br />
Mary took the sample as Roger followed her, donkey Elroy then took to following his dad and then owner, he too wishing to know if he had bred his mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, the young Jack is not to blame, he is not the sire who fathered the pregnancy. Do you have any other donkey Jacks or maybe then one of your Trotter stallions is the sire?&quot; Mary asked of Roger. It was then she noted the donkey so named Elroy give a sigh of relief and act as if he felt relieved by hearing the news he was not the father to the jennet being pregnant.<br />
<br />
Elroy then brayed and turned around, his still flaccidly erect cock flagging from side to side, slapping at his flanks when he walked, walking then to visit his estranged donkey brother Brian.<br />
<br />
Mary took to following then Elroy as did Roger walk along behind Mary, the three going to visit donkey Jack Brian.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-r-I-a-n,&quot; Roger called out to alert his donkified son of him coming to visit his as well donkified son.<br />
<br />
Brian had heard much with his exceptionally good hearing ability afforded by his taller ears. As veterinarian Mary swung open the door to the box stall housing donkey Brian, he expecting to meet his dad, the young Jack-stud stood poised, having reared high on his strong hind legs and with masturbating his cock to near spewing a load of semen, he had planned to infect his father and make of him a Jackass.<br />
<br />
Brian brayed just as the stall door opened and he let go a spewed load of pent semen, flushing the wealth of his donkey size big balls into the kindly face and stunned, as open mouthed lady veterinarian, Mary.<br />
<br />
Practicing had brought Brian to a new level of perfecting how to hold back as spew forth his semen. He knew the likely truth that it was his semen what had impregnated his donkified mother, he having heard her snuffling and whimpering cries made by a jennet donkey feeling her worst ever monthly panged feeling of then equine style estrus. He had gone to console his ailing dear mother, only to sniff her rank scent what aroused his equine hormones, and in turn stiffened his donkey cock.<br />
<br />
Mable had as then not lived in her new donkey jennet form of a full day when with meeting there her transformed son Brian, she followed her changing instincts and turned her rump toward a young stud, raised her tail as she then let spurt her urine to add a scent of enticement to the very male donkey standing eying her. Mentally enough still having a human mind and knowledge in his brain, Brian feeling the urge to mount and mate the donkey jennet he knew all too well was his changed, donkified mother, the brut act was not one of incest, but a merciful quelling of his donkey mother feeling beastly pains.  <br />
<br />
Mable brayed her greetings to her sons, and having heard Roger yell the name of Brian, she knew her husband had figured her being pregnant was from her elder son in donkey embodiment having come to the aid of his hurting mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn you, you dare to have sex and impregnate your own mother...,&quot; Roger blurting out what he had on his mind, while having forgotten there was a professional witness there hearing a man speaking to what looked like a common donkey, was if fact his blue-powder changed son.<br />
<br />
Mary having heard what Roger exclaim had her mouth open when she opened the stall door and while talking, asking then Roger if he knew about, or his sons had tried mixing of Blue powder to make a witches&#39; brew. Her answer came when donkey Brian blew his pent load at her, some of what entered her mouth, stuck to her throat, she choking, coughing did swallow what ejaculated out the round-open end to a fully aroused erect donkey cock.<br />
<br />
Brian seeing he had infected Mary the veterinarian, he let go his fore-hoof holding at the stall doorway and feel forward, impaling Mary, he open stunned mouth with the bulked trumpet bell shaped end to his stout donkey cock. He pushed her down to lying on the barn floor, his cock head filling her mouth, while trails of semen and thick pre trickled out his cock and down the throat of one surprised veterinarian.<br />
<br />
Retained essence of Blue powder was part of the semen blending what entered the mouth of Mary, she staring up as back at Roger, tried to ask of him if his donkey was a product of Blue Powder.<br />
<br />
Blue powder essence is very infectious, and having entered a mouth, the heavy semen tends to seek toward the corners of the oral cavity, especially under the tongue where large volume of blood flows and captures any substance caught under the tongue. As instantaneous reaction to Blue powder semen is that the victim feels and undeniable urge to suckle what is imposed into the mouth. Suckling of infectious donkey cock and spewed semen literally guarantees the transformation of a body to becoming animalistic of form and species.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, but I am sorry for you Mary,&quot; Roger said, as then Brian brayed his felt triumph for having mated and asserting, gained a new jennet for his ever increasing donkey herd.<br />
<br />
Mary felt a sense of seduction, urging her to begin hand stroking the erect donkey cock, stiffening of it, and bringing the Jack donkey sire to feeling his next climax coming sooner than he planned.<br />
<br />
Elroy having seen the cock sucking did wheel on his heels and ran galloping through the barn seeking any female equine willing of him to mate. As did his brother, Elroy paid a visit to his donkey mother, and soon their brayed delights added to those of Brian and a changing veterinarian Mary as she felt her body changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet, kindly Brian, who could figure of him to becoming a perverse, beast, a donkey stud, wishing to father his having a donkey herd?&quot; Said Roger, he backing away to let Brian have his fun with kindly Mary the local veterinarian.</p>
