<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The jasper colored twins were Jay, Pence, the topaz twins Toni and Paula, the golden pair <br />
Giselle and Gretchen (the daughters of Abdul and Martha) and their half sisters the Lazuli <br />
colored Laura and Zulema (Abdul and Ingrid's children), and the returned (but <br />
unquestioned) Carnelian colored Casandra and Lily, Maddex and Whitney's girls (Maddex's <br />
absence not even thought about). <br />
<br />
Zelipe, being the odd one out, the pale pink wolf boy kept his distance from the whole <br />
thing, watching TV for a bit, then choosing to play Bart and Jenny's Wii since there was no <br />
line at the moment. <br />
<br />
The lupman pups all ate like pigs wolfing down their ice cream. The two sets of <br />
quadruplets politely said nothing (except Nane who just HAD to get one crack in).  Lupman <br />
were known for hyper organized families and convoluted mating structure, not table <br />
manners. <br />
<br />
Whitney admonished her daughters for their behavior, while Abdul let his twins pretty do <br />
as they wished in this instance.  'I'm just lucky we have pantries the size of a warehouse.' <br />
Then again, given how big Lupman were, they required more calories to function, and <br />
Leoman required even more! <br />
<br />
Gargoyles didn't eat, theories of their power source ranged from solar beams to <br />
geothermal energy.  Dragons could eat anything, -anything-, bones, plants, meat, there <br />
were even tales of dragons who had become hermits who survived on a diet of rocks! <br />
Felman due to their size were below humans on the need for intact, likely what had helped <br />
their species somehow manage to survive despite their small numbers (dragons owed their <br />
small numbers due to more than a few wars on the losing side, and a low reproductive rate <br />
or some even theorized had lost the biological -need- to reproduce). <br />
<br />
When the extermination of the Pack's supply of Blood Ripple ice cream, the pups quickly <br />
turned their attention again to the idea of having a expedition to the edge of the pack's <br />
territory.<br />
<br />
The Omegas were the silver Martha (who was not present keeping an eye on Kaylee's <br />
children), the blue and gold Abdul (who was the least mutated of all the Omega only <br />
having two tails and a double wolf hood), silver and blue Maddex, and the blue and silver <br />
Ryan who was Maddex's brother, and of course Whitney who was the only one besides <br />
Abdul who only had one head (double she did have double of most everything else, and <br />
was silver with red-orange highlights and had red-orange hair while the rest of the <br />
Omegas were 'baled.').<br />
<br />
Let Martha the duel headed wolves only had one awareness both their heads wired to the <br />
same brain.  <br />
<br />
The gem twins of course still wanted to go on their adventure even after the ice cream. <br />
Even more so now that there were wound-up. <br />
<br />
There was some quick debate on who should stay with Zelipe to keep an eye on him. <br />
Whitney and Abdul were logical since they only had one head to keep eyes on one pup, but <br />
their children commanded they go with them.<br />
<br />
 This left Ryan (in what could be considered a waste of resources) the only one without <br />
pups (much to his humiliation since he had been intended to be Martha's true made before <br />
convolution had ended up making them all husbands to Martha), to stay with Zelipe… <br />
<br />
Ryan's job proved quite easy almost boring as Zelipe spent the time using the Wii which he <br />
normally was too meek to ask about using. <br />
<br />
SO Whitney, Maddex, Abdul, played host to six pups, (and only five heads to share between <br />
them). The double quadruplets after a quick discussion among themselves decided to tag <br />
along. The omegas were actually relieved rather than worried. Tano and Maja, in spite of <br />
being the exact same age as their siblings (if by a few seconds) were often more mature <br />
and take charge than the rest, and Nane seemed to be not interested in causing trouble <br />
this hike (they were going to have to take that girl to a doctor, her attitude was NOT <br />
normal Leoman behavior). <br />
<br />
Collecting dried meat from the pantry (over the protests of the pups wanting something <br />
more fancy until Abdul and Whitney convinced them this was more like a 'real' hike this <br />
way) the squad of three adults and fourteen children left out the pack door… their hugs <br />
numbers of course scarring Jack and Marcine into having The Herd scatter… they had no <br />
way to know course that the wolves weren't after them today. <br />
<br />
As for the expedition itself, it was a nearly perfectly straight line from the Big Bad Wolf <br />
Pack Manor to as far as the Pack legally owned. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Trinity and Kimberley meanwhile on their off shift played poker. Being Gallery Wolves and <br />
present for the Dare that created the original statues wolves, were the only ones aware <br />
how Sunny, Luna, and Sarah had not always been statues. They had been the 'single she-<br />
wolf club.'  Trinity and Kimberley did however decide to mix things up and play their card <br />
game in front of the statues, including a few as mock players. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUt if they're married to the Monkey Prince, they aren't single, and aren't part of the club <br />
right?&quot; Kimberley asked. <br />
<br />
Trinity shrugged, &quot;I'm through trying to convince them otherwise, if this is what they want, <br />
I'm not going to force them one way or the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
The five statues all continued to sit still and silence. The goddess' of food and the moon <br />
hugging each other, while the sun and dawn had their shoulders on each other, and the <br />
Monkey Prince in the middle grinning at it all. <br />
<br />
Sarah knew it would take just a thought to leave this still world… to go back to being <br />
among them. BUt it felt so strangely interesting to be silently observing them rather than <br />
feeling trapped or crippled like she figured she should be feeling. Moving about this way <br />
and that, chaotically changing from one second to the next. And Sarah and the others <br />
found themselves again wondering 'Was I ever really one of them?' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Big Bad Island for her part, remained peaceful and mostly silent. Save for the giggling of <br />
two fairies born from the souls of Eve and Eve The Next killed by Kurse to expand her <br />
power to cataclysmic levels.  Their island's care taker (which Marie-Eliza knew to be her <br />
without she liked it or not) was not there, but they'd keep the island looking pretty and <br />
peaceful until the loves decided to return. <br />
<br />
It remained the fever dream beautiful landscape it had become following Kurse's death and <br />
Marie-Eliza taking her place in the nexus of power left empty by Kurse's destruction (since <br />
had never been alive, death felt like an odd choice of words). <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza wondered if she and her mother should retire there, while getting permission <br />
from the Pack of course… Marie-Eliza figured she could cause the least damage there with <br />
the unequaled power she had.  She figured she'd be the least tempted there to make <br />
herself queen of the world and end  all drug lords, slave traffic, and war with one gesture. <br />
<br />
Her story was finally coming to a close. She had considered for a time turning her audience <br />
into copies of her, and spreading out their shared power among the new Mare-Eliza's, thus <br />
making it less concentrated, and thus less likely to be abused and thus making herself less <br />
powerful in the process. <br />
<br />
 She could simply WISH AWAY her power she'd do so, but it had become an integrated part <br />
of her, impossible to separate from herself, turning other beings into doubles of herself <br />
was the ONLY way to spread out the power so she wouldn't be in danger of becoming a <br />
dictator. They'd have to have her exact identity for her power to accept them, they'd have <br />
to cease to exist as the people they were… like the witches had done to their innocent <br />
victims in the name of making the world fair… <br />
<br />
But even though she knew it was for the greater good, and to save herself from a self <br />
imposed exile, and to save the world from her if she surrendered to temptation and chose <br />
to 'fix' the world with a flick of her wrist, and then likely to challenge God/The <br />
Truth/Jehovah/YHWH for it's/his/her throne …    She couldn't do it. <br />
<br />
She remembered each and every one of the people who the witches had wiped out of <br />
existence. She remembered their names, their faces, their voices. And now it was like those <br />
people had never been born for all the difference it made! She couldn't bring herself to do <br />
it. Even if it was to possibly save the world from herself, she couldn't bring herself to <br />
commit murder. <br />
<br />
So she simply continued the story which was reaching it's conclusion. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Father Draco's eyes shot open. And Officer Linus Sure's heads snapped awake. The two <br />
stood up together. Vatican turned to look at them. Free meanwhile, sensing her masters' <br />
deaths (but masters by her own choice this time rather than forced upon her, and that <br />
made all the difference) would have cried if she had the tear ducts for it. But that was <br />
something Gargoyles could never do, let alone experience taste … or smell… Free hadn't <br />
thought about this price since her transformation, since given all things, it had been a <br />
small price to pay. <br />
<br />
Mal'Akh started, as Joella and Lark turned to look. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Joella, we are here to ssserve/serve you.&quot; Said the super naga and the former dragon. <br />
<br />
Mal'Akh looked in despair, figuring Joella's command hadn't worked, not having a clue <br />
about the clash between Joella's command and Death's geass that had nearly left the two <br />
comatose for the rest of their lives. And the only way for a compromise to be reached was <br />
to make serving Joella what they WANTED! <br />
<br />
Lark turned to Running Bear's corpse and shook it's arm, trying to get him awake. When <br />
nothing happened, Mal'Akh and Joella were at a struggle of which one was going to tell <br />
her… Joella finally came beside her adopted sibling and whispered in her ear. <br />
<br />
Lark simple listened. She lost the closest thing he had had to a mother her entire life, and <br />
now the man whom the witches had set up near demigod status among their creations and <br />
followers was dead too…<br />
<br />
Lark couldn't take it anymore… she broke down in tears. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And that was how Sister Marie Cruz and Sister Kathrine would find them…&quot; Marie-Eliza <br />
said, &quot;The two girls crying, the cub finding herself torn on weather to accept Lark was a <br />
person or not, Free al so grieving, and Vatican, Father Draco and Linus helping Joella in any <br />
way they could … &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than she expected I guess…&quot; Lawrence said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie Cruz at this point didn't know WHAT to expect… she was just happy she didn't end <br />
up with another fight on her hands, and wrongly concluded that the Witch's Dare didn't <br />
turn her friends into enemies, not knowing about the clash with Death's geass. <br />
<br />
No one who cared for the witches were present when their bodies were burned, not even <br />
their animal familiars, who had no value in their masters' corpses.  And as I said, Herodias <br />
would seek Roselia as a new master, if even more carefully and benign than with Goldwyn, <br />
and Lilith would chose to simply commit suicide to be with her master in death. <br />
<br />
Running-Bear's funeral, given his connection with the witches, was given a funeral display <br />
that would make the ghosts of some heads of state jealous, and personally I think they <br />
were working out their grief via their adopted Grandfather since they weren't able to say <br />
goodbye to the witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence said, &quot;Like Joseph Stalin's funeral… people were in tears when he died… He was <br />
a murderous dictator but had such good publicity that no one found out what a monster he <br />
was until later… &quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza nodded. Betty smiled to see her nephew was still in there somewhere <br />
underneath all those layers of muscle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Running-Bear's funeral would be fit for a king. They even erected a small memorial of him <br />
on top of his grave in the witches backyard. <br />
<br />
Over the next three hundred years, the Jewish Glendale Pride and the Witch Pride would <br />
convert and intermarry, the Witch Pride adopting the name of the Glendales as the evil the <br />
witches had done overshadowed the good, until the salem witch trials were reexamined <br />
and historical revisionists choose the witches had been just chaotic, not evil. <br />
<br />
The natives of course were just overjoyed to have their family members back, even if some <br />
would have to grow up again. Glendale's people, free of the witches' fog over their minds, <br />
realized full well what the witches had done, and had been doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha asked her fellow former Glass.  &quot;What about the Mayor and his wife/daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone was returned to how they were, some were simple too integrated into what <br />
they became inside the witches' sphere of influence. The Mayor now believed his wife had <br />
died in child birth and his daughter had been trying on her mother's dresses... given the <br />
sheer insanity that had come close to devouring them all, it was a subconscious reflex to <br />
keep them from slipping into madness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sunnydale Syndrome.&quot; Lawrence said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Everyone looked at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;A popular vampire slayers show took place in a town called Sunnydale. The average <br />
person remained almost fanatically unaware of the monsters that walked right past them <br />
and tried to eat them. It became a running gag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the effects of the witches magic had some thing to do with all of the warps as well, <br />
not just self inflicted obviousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Marie Cruz was more interested, perhaps due to death's geass, in sorting out what to <br />
do with the witches small army of followers whom Marie and her friends had also killed <br />
some off... Not to mention killed the witches themselves even if it was by due process... <br />
Only Joella and their pure devotion to her will prevented them from trying to pull as many <br />
people as possible and themselves into death to join their masters. <br />
<br />
Herodias' litters and descendants would be hunted down for decades until the idea of <br />
witches and familiars became popular fiction and animal rights groups became powerful <br />
enough to cease the tradition the Pack had come to take part in with festivity.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mal'Akh explained to the pups, &quot;Joella was an orphan girl the witches took in, I don't know <br />
where she came from, maybe the witches felt some sympathy towards her having lost their <br />
parents themselves. ... After the wicked witches were gone, the witches cursed some of the <br />
hunters to be her loyal servants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The game.&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The game.&quot; Mal'Akh replied, not really able to see the pups from where she was laying <br />
down on the bed but she could hear them well enough even if she couldn't provide eye <br />
contact... &quot;The witches wanted Joella to want for nothing, no matter who they had to take it <br />
from to provide to her... Joella I think never once got a clue how her foster parents were <br />
wicked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't know they were witches?&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh she knew they were witches, she just didn't know they were wicked witches. She <br />
thought they were good, so she tried her hardest to always be good too... &quot;<br />
<br />
All the pups looked at each other confused at the paradox (to them) presented. &quot;She <br />
became good because she thought bad people were good people?&quot; Marcy asked first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;My head hurts.&quot; Marcy lamented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember when her, Lark, one of her 'adopted' sisters, and me went back the witches' <br />
house after the wicked witches were dead... everyone greeted her like a princess of a <br />
kingdom after the king and queen had died...  I remember the hunters talking about <br />
making those who the witches had changed back to normal again, and how it would hurt <br />
more people to do that if they did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How's that work?&quot; Jenny tilted her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never understood that part to be honest. But I think Joella was happy that her 'adopted <br />
brothers and s-sisters' weren't going away... &quot; Mal'Akh shuddered at the mention of <br />
sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Marcy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing.&quot; Mal'Akh said not wanting to share some things with pups. <br />
<br />

<br />
Once upon a time in the 1980s... <br />
<br />
There was a popular toyline invented called 'My Little Pony.' It was popular enough that a <br />
cartoon show based on the toys was produces by 1986. While a transparent marketing <br />
tool, it kept children entertained and happy. <br />
<br />
Also once upon a time in the 1980s there was a little girl in Glendale and her parents. That <br />
girl was totally in love with the franchise and their parents spoiled her as much as their <br />
savings would allow. Just glade to see her happy. <br />
<br />
She had been riding along on the sidewalk and was distracted by a truck carrying horses <br />
when she ran over a little boy's action figure of the super hero the Human Torch. <br />
<br />
Now this boy's family was NOT as well off as the little girl's, and the action figure had been <br />
his sole christmas present. The little girl, ignorant of how others kids didn't have as many <br />
toys as her, still stopped when she realized what she had done and saw the broken plastic <br />
defender of truth and justice and offered one of her many plastic ponies as compensation. <br />
<br />
Now this little boy, he was not used to people apologizing when something bad happened <br />
to him. He looked at the toy, and the girl, and thought she was being mean. <br />
<br />
His thoughts on his favorite super hero, and his mind burning with rage as only a child <br />
knows, he snarled out, &quot;Transform or Dare!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; However the game did not allow for something that obvious, it was <br />
simply too easy for something like that, the victim had to consciously chose. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm gonna make you something! Or I'm gonna make ya do something! Or ya get both!&quot; <br />
<br />
Realizing this must have been the game that big girls played or something like it, 'truth or <br />
dare' she replied, &quot;Okay I chose Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Red in the face and tears coming down his face he roared, &quot;SET YER HOUSE ON FIRE! AND <br />
KEEP SETTIN' IT ON FIRE UNTIL IT ALL BURNS DOWN!&quot;<br />
<br />
The little girl gasped as the overwhelming thought, the overwhelming need filled her head, <br />
'I've gotta set my house on fire until it burns down!' She thought with the same force as <br />
someone else thinks, 'I need to breath!'  <br />
<br />
The little boy, Mitch, had gotten the turn from his big brother, Mack, had used it so Mitch <br />
would act as a look out and courier for when Mitch bought, traded, or sold his narcotics, <br />
and had phrased it so Mitch could never use the game on Mack!<br />
<br />
Mack had gotten it from his group of friends, who had used it on each other to give <br />
themselves manhood lengths that would made horses envious. <br />
<br />
They had gotten it from a teenage girl who dared them to never touch another person <br />
unless they wanted to be touched by them without being forced or intimidated to. <br />
<br />
She had gotten it from a lazy pervert who she rejected to have sex with the nearest man <br />
whenever she heard a word that had eleven or more letters. Her family had ultimately <br />
learned Japanese and moved to Japan, because the words spoken there were in symbols, <br />
not letters. <br />
<br />
The lazy bum had gotten it from a nerd back when the lazy bum was a jock and the nerd <br />
made it so every time the jock was a jerk to someone he'd gain five pounds of lard.  <br />
<br />
The nerd had gotten it from his grandfather on the old man's death bed to write his <br />
grandpa's confession, who had used the game and the loopholes in the game to always <br />
have the turn returned to him, and to make women, men, children and the infantile to pose <br />
for him before turning into nude marble, bronze, what-have-you, statues. The cycle went <br />
on and on! <br />
<br />
The little girl with all the ability to resist as one has the ability one has to make their own <br />
heart stop beating by thinking about it, immediately went home. <br />
<br />
The little girl at once hunted through the family kitchen for matches, and immediately used <br />
each and everyone to set everything in the dinning room on fire, and using the flames of <br />
the dinning room set everything in the living room on fire. And unable to stop herself, <br />
without any hesitation, set on fire her own room, and her precious collection of ponies. <br />
<br />
Her parents had been in the front yard, and had seen their child go in, (and while having <br />
seen the exchange between the two children hadn't heard what had been said), and only <br />
when the flames started to come out of the windows did they realize what had been going <br />
on, only by then did the smoke finally drift into their senses on that fine summer's day. <br />
<br />
They found their child inside, still trapped by the will of the game, setting everything on <br />
fire she could see, she had begun to set fire to the family album when they finally found <br />
her and swiftly took her outside. Child and parents their lungs and flesh seared by the <br />
smoke and flames, were outside the house in time to see the flames start up even more <br />
intensely. Immediately the girl began to try and set fire to the outside out of the house <br />
even as the insides turned to reach the outside!<br />
<br />
They managed to stop her, and demanded to know what she was doing, she replied in a <br />
warped happy voice that she had to turn down the house. They spanked her, AFTER calling <br />
the fire department of course. But in that moment, the house went beyond the point of <br />
being able to be saved, and the turn ran it's course. The girl instantly screamed and broke <br />
down crying (which she hadn't while being spanked) and in total hysteria blurted out a <br />
broken babble of what had happened. When her parents heard her describe 'Transform or <br />
Dare' they could barely believe it, not WANTING to believe it, doing their best to ignore that <br />
the curse was very likely real and hoping it would just go away when ignored like most <br />
things. <br />
<br />
Seeing her house burn down, the little girl thought it was the end of the world. Her parents <br />
managed to gather that it was not their child's fault. The little boy who had 'started' all this <br />
had run away in fear when the reality what he had done caught up with him. <br />
<br />
The little girl's mind spun at what had happened. And wished with all her heart and soul <br />
that things could be better. The rules of the game said you could not use a turn on <br />
yourself. <br />
<br />
The parents hugged their child. Insurance companies did not acknowledge the existence of <br />
the game. Everyone in town knew that. It far too easy, even for those who knew the game <br />
was real, to commit fraud. The parents own fear and grief stricken minds felt dread in their <br />
minds, the police or someone else might be able to tell that the fire had been self set, on <br />
one would blame their child, for that they were grateful. But arson would be at the <br />
forefront of everyone's minds, and the most logical culprit to be the parents themselves, in <br />
particular since they had renewed and upgraded their insurance of light of a small <br />
electrical fire that happened earlier from one too many power strips being used from one <br />
outlet. <br />
<br />
Everything they owned had gone up in flames, they had no idea of the existence of Madam <br />
Serenity or that the police may or may not direct them to her, even if they had believed <br />
anyone in turn would believe them about the curse. (Only their absolute trust in their child <br />
allowed them to realize the truth). <br />
<br />
The parents hug their child as she hugged them, all three crying. Despair gripped them. <br />
<br />
Then the little girl said something unexpected to the parents. And then said, &quot;Pwease <br />
choose twansform.&quot;<br />
<br />
This startled the parents, then looked at each other, both thinking the same thing, 'What <br />
do we have left to loose?' <br />
<br />
They said almost at the same time, &quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change inta real My Little Ponies, who live on a magic farm where nothing really bad <br />
happens, where we can all have fun and be happy, so we can all be My Little Ponies like on <br />
TV and we can all live happily ever after!&quot; <br />
<br />
The parents shuddered as did their little girl. <br />
<br />
Somewhere at the same time Madam Serenity was knocked out cold, lucky to have not <br />
been driving at the time. This made it near impossible for her to track them.  Weather this <br />
was due to the game obeying their need for privacy to ensure their 'happily ever after' or <br />
simple the back lash of needing to alter fate all the way till the end of time, was anyone's <br />
guess. <br />
<br />
Logically, the game could have simply turned them into toys, but she had said 'magic farm' <br />
and had said to 'live' happily ever after, both of which negated this interpretation. <br />
<br />
The parents clothes vanished. <br />
<br />
Besides the openings on their heads they completely sealed up. Their skin became <br />
incredibly smooth. Their body shapes completely changed. Their hair shifted into <br />
something resembling a horses' manes. And their tail bones sprout real tails that vaguely <br />
resemble a horse's.  The father's skin became a uniform pink, while the other's magenta. <br />
Their hands and feet became identical stumps. They felt their center of gravity shift, but <br />
stand up on what was now their hind legs easily enough. Their faces pushed into a cartoon <br />
version of a horse's muzzle. Their ears became triangular and moved to the top of their <br />
heads. They blinked once, and their eyes became huge, with long eyelashes and matching <br />
colored eyes and their hair turned to a lighter shade of their skin. <br />
<br />
Finally, a pair of stars (a second star to the right) appeared on the father's rump and a <br />
valentine heart within a heart formed on the mother's rump.<br />
<br />
They became about half the size they had been before. The two new ponies looked at each <br />
other in silent awe and then nuzzled their daughter. Within seconds, the same <br />
transformation had come over her, but purple with a white and pink wheel on her rear.<br />
<br />
Feeling a pure and overwhelming draw, the three ponies walked away from the burning <br />
down house, not really mattering anymore. <br />
<br />
No one paid the doll shaped horses any mind, they simply kept marches down the side <br />
walk and people made way for them, then they walked out into the wilderness and <br />
predatory animals merely turned a blind eye to them. They kept walking until they were <br />
nearly on the very edge of Glendale's city limits and just stopped.<br />
<br />
They nuzzled at the ground, and out of th ground came a pink and white farm house <br />
shaped in the style of a child's playset both to scale of their actual pony size and not made <br />
just for appearance. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's beautiful Never-Star.&quot; Said of one the two larger girl ponies.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is Valentines.&quot; Nodded the pink life size My LIttle Pony. <br />
<br />
They then nuzzled the smaller My LIttle Pony with them, &quot;Thank you Fate. It really is the <br />
best.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome,&quot; She nuzzled back. <br />
<br />
The three My Little Ponies after that settled into their new home. What became the most <br />
shocking was how they could hold and manipulate objects with their front hooves even <br />
though they had no fingers through some form of limited telekinesis. <br />
<br />
They found they didn't need to go the bathroom, and didn't have the openings even if they <br />
wanted. They could eat, but nothing ever came out, and their never gained weight. 'Guess <br />
happily ever after doesn't need bathrooms or obesity.' Thought Never-Star calmly to <br />
herself. <br />
<br />
The tools that came with the farm house proved easy to use for them, and the soil and <br />
plants proved very corporative. <br />
<br />
A month later, Valentines made a lament about missing her parents (Fate's grandparents). <br />
And not five minutes later, the old couple had found the farm where no one else had. They <br />
were shocked to say the least about what had happened to their daughter, son in law and <br />
granddaughter. <br />
<br />
Fate begged them to join them... and the old couple, well past retirement age and secretly <br />
the old having the first signs of cancer... the two agreed. And in moments they had <br />
became a light blue and cyan colored My Little Pony with a heads up coin and flower on <br />
their rears. <br />
<br />
They welcomed Lucky and Daisy back into their family. <br />
<br />
When Lucy, Daisy, and Fate had discussed a few years later how they'd like something <br />
interesting to happen, that night a couple failed bank robbers during a half hazard get <br />
away stumbled on the farm, and not sure what to do pigged out and tried to steal anything <br />
valuable they found (which wasn't that much not finding any money), before Lucky and <br />
Daisy found them. One of the robbers shot Lucky in the head, the bullet slid off her like it <br />
was a rain drop. <br />
<br />
Then the criminals made a break for it but where cut off by Fate who tackled them to the <br />
floor. <br />
<br />
She told them she'd let them go if they'd work on the farm for a while to make up for the <br />
trouble they caused. When the robbers calmed down enough they agreed. And the black <br />
and white ponies, Night (with a white moon symbol) and Day (with a black sun symbol) <br />
joined the farm. <br />
<br />
The two quickly agreed with each other their lives here beat being criminals or going to jail <br />
and their lives as human criminals soon felt like just a bad dream they once had and their <br />
lives as My Little Ponies became their only reality the more they wished not remember their <br />
former lives. <br />
<br />
Other friends and family found their way to the Farm, many agreed to become part of their <br />
family, some did not, and woke up in their heads remembering every single detail but not <br />
feeling like disturbing their loved one's happiness. <br />
<br />
Then came the boy who had started the whole mess, having found them and wanting to be <br />
forgiven. And he didn't want to go back to Mack.... And that was how a red pony with a <br />
jewel on her rear came to be named Ruby.<br />
<br />
When Never-Star thought about what it must have been like for Valentines to give birth to <br />
Fate and dearly wanting to experience that for herself, she spent the next eleven months <br />
pregnant and gave birth to Fate's 'Twin' Destiny who continued to grow until she was Fate's <br />
age. <br />
<br />
And in twenty years none of them showed any signs of aging. She had said 'happily ever <br />
after' after all. They couldn't 'live' happily 'ever after' if they died. <br />
<br />
Then Destiny wanted to know more about the outside world without leaving home. <br />
<br />
Then the wolf pack expedition got lost... and met with a purple My Little Pony who <br />
introduced herself as Destiny and asking them politely if they wanted to chat for a little bit.</p>
