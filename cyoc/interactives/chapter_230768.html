<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah now pulled up a chair, casting the queen of the fae a befuddled look. It didn&#39;t seem possible! How could Glitter be her mother? &quot;I&#39;m guessing you have alot of questions,&quot; Glitter asked sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh YEAH,&quot; Sarah exclaimed. &quot;I came here to strengthen diplomatic ties with the fae and instead I find out my mom isn&#39;t my mom and that I&#39;m part fairy!?&quot; Sarah seethed, she felt betrayed as if her entire life was a lie. Glitter for her part remained quiet, allowing Sarah to vent her frustrations. After a few moments, Sarah composed herself, taking a breath as she smoothed her borrowed clothes. She needed to be professional, she still had a job to do. &quot;Why don&#39;t you start at the beginning,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve already told you,&quot; Glitter replied curiously. &quot;Just humor me,&quot; Sarah groaned. Glitter nodded, taking a breath before speaking. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;It was around 1970. Both your parents as well as a few of their friends were pulled into the realm of the fae. The reason behind that was due to the actions of a descendent of the leader of the Normal. I believe he&#39;s referred to as the Boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s eyes went wide in surprise, Glitter appeared to have left out the part about the Normal. &quot;Okay WAIT timeout,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Are you telling me my parents have dealt with the Normal before?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they weren&#39;t called the Normal then,&quot; Glitter shrugged. &quot;In fact the Boss’s descendent didn&#39;t even form the Normal until after me and your parents defeated him and sent him back to the mortal realm.&quot; Sarah felt as if her head was spinning, was her family responsible for the current mess they were in? &quot;Are you okay Sarah you look pale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Sarah said quickly before furrowing her brow. &quot;And don&#39;t you start with the concerned mother act. I&#39;ve been doing just fine for the last 38 years.&quot; Sarah sighed, she was letting her emotions get in the way of the job. &quot;Look I&#39;m sorry okay. But, just the idea that my folks may have inadvertently created the Normal is alot to swallow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Glitter replied quietly. An awkward silence now lingered between the pair. This was not how the fairy wanted things to go. She understood how dangerous the Boss and the Normal could be, that an alliance with S.P.E.A.R was in everyone&#39;s best interest. &quot;Did you know one of your parents friends made a cartoon about our adventures?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry what,&quot; Sarah asked, utterly confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Saturday morning cartoon,&quot; Glitter stated. &quot;One of your parents friends grew up to be an animator. He designed a cartoon based on our adventures. Care to see it?&quot; Sarah had no answer, simply offering a dull nod as Glitter now stood. Grabbing an ancient looking VHS tape that Sarah thought wouldn&#39;t even work as the fairy now went about playing the tape on a conjured TV. Sarah watched as the tape began to play, a poppy, synth tune that seemed stereotypically 80s echoing through the room. She hated to admit it, but the tune was kind of catchy. As the introduction continued to play, Sarah gasped as the teens were now confronted by a very familiar looking cartoon fairy. &quot;Oh my god this that you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Glitter smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the hell are you wearing a purple leotard and leggings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the 80s,&quot; Glitter groaned. &quot;And I never actually wore that! The guys in marketing wanted something that was fashionable at the time. So, your parents friend dressed me in that but drew my likeness. He changed the likeness of the human characters too but, based their personalities on the people he knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah simply nodded, watching the cartoons introduction end. That her family history seemed to revolve around a Saturday morning cartoon from the 1980s was both fascinating and mortifying. &quot;That cartoon was the reason I came to the human realm,&quot; Glitter stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glitter smiled, finding Sarah&#39;s confusion somewhat amusing. &quot;The cartoon,&quot; she smiled. &quot;It was a huge accomplishment. Jon&#39;s friend was still new in the industry and this was a major milestone for him. We all ended up going to his house to watch the first episode. We found it amusing, here was a cartoon loosely based on our adventures and we were the only ones aware of it. It was during that time that your father and I fell in love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah simply gawked, watching as a sad smile now spread across Glitter’s face. &quot;I knew your father had a bit of a crush on me,&quot; Glitter said. &quot;Everyone did. If you look closely in the cartoon, you can see the character your father was based on deeply cared for Glitter, more so than the others. Anyway, we ended up making love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay ewww,&quot; Sarah said quickly scrunching up her nose. &quot;Please skip the sex story with my dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Glitter blushed. &quot;Anyway, next thing we knew I was pregnant. Nine months later and you were born, only problem was your father and mother decided to marry before that. They always loved eachother. Your father and I? We knew it wouldn&#39;t last, your mother was his true love, she knew that and well....despite the awkwardness of the situation she forgave me and him. Ann truely is a Saint.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that sounds like mom,&quot; Sarah shrugged. &quot;She doesn&#39;t have a mean bone in her body. But, how come you never showed up afterwards? I mean, dad died over 20 years ago. I never even saw you at the funeral.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After the three of us realized your fae heritage was suppressed we decided that it would be best if I remained out of the picture,&quot; Glitter sighed. &quot;We all agreed that it would be best not to complicate things, especially after Jon died. Ann is, was, and forever will be your mother. She cared for you, far better than I think I could have. Yes, you are the heir to the fae throne but that needn&#39;t be your burden. You deserved your own life. Still, it did affect how I&#39;ve viewed humans ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have encouraged fairies to have relationships with humans,&quot; Glitter smirked. &quot;On more than just a professional level. It&#39;s why I was so excited to hear about Spark falling in love with the Moreland boy as well Calista bearing a child with a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad had that much of an effect?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Glitter exclaimed happily. &quot;Humans are just so interesting.&quot; Sarah simply nodded, there really wasn&#39;t much to say. Something told her the familial relations she had with the fairies would make these negotiations go rather smoothly.</p>
