<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob awoke to the sound of his alarm clock going off. He hit the snooze button, still half asleep, and laid in his bed, wanting more sleep. He could hear the faint sound of the shower running, knowing Alex was already up. Jacob woke up when his alarm went off again, and promptly hit the snooze button. Jacob slowly sat up in bed, feeling the eggs in his body move closer to their exit points. Jacob delicately slid his body toward the floor, and hobbled his naked body to the bathroom. Alex turned off the water just as Jacob  entered, and opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its all yours,&quot; Alex smiled.<br />
<br />
Jacob forced his body to move, and he slowly stammered into the shower and closed the door and turned on the water to a warm temperature. There was a place to sit in the shower, but Jacob got down on his hands and knees, his back to the shower as he relaxed let wave after wave of orgasm crash through is body as the six small eggs and two large eggs passed from both his vagina and anus. The shower was full of the pungent smell of latex and the natural lube Jacob&#39;s body produced. A little sore from the stretching but still enjoying the afterglow of the orgasms, Jacob rested in under the warm water.  Several minutes later, Jacob stood up on his knees, and picked up one of the larger eggs, and stepped up to sit on the shower seat. Jacob tore a slit into the latex covered egg and reached in the slick egg mucus which was the same lube jelly his body now produced. Reaching around for a few seconds, he grabbed and pulled out a smooth foot long yellow dildo with what looked like a big nipple on one end. Jacob reached forward to turn off the shower, and then stood up slightly so he could slip the dildo into his ass. The dildo slid right in to his already slick anus, and Jacob pushed on the nipple end of the dildo until it was completely inside his ass. He rubbed the nipple of the dildo inside him with his finger until he could feel his finger touching the nipple and stopped. Jacob felt a warmth in his ass, pleasant and filling. A thick layer of yellow latex was starting to come out of Jacob&#39;s ass and flow along his skin, covering his body from the waist down to just below his knees. Jacob was admiring how the latex hugged every curve when Alex opened the shower door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,,,we have to leave for school soon,&quot; Alex told Jacob with a fake sense of urgency. Alex was ready for school and was now waiting on Jacob. Alex closed the shower door and went back to his room.<br />
<br />
Jacob took the other large egg and lifted it to the shower seat, and opened it up to grab another identical blue dildo. Jacob placed the blue dildo between his A-cup breasts and began to rub and pinch the nipple on the bottom of the blue dildo, stopping again as soon as he felt the sensations from the nipple. The blue latex wrapped around his torso, and locked the dildo between his breasts, which looked vacuumed to his body with the huge dildo showing prominently on his chest. Jacob turned on the water to rinse off and stepped out of the shower just over a minute later. Jacob stepped out of the shower carrying the six smaller eggs and put them in the bathroom sink. Jacob quickly dried off with a towel, and took the eggs to the kitchen where he put them in the refrigerator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, your taking forever today, let&#39;s go,&quot; Alex demanded.<br />
<br />
Jacob went to his room, got his backpack and what looked like shiny slip on covered sandals for shoes, and walked out the door, passing Alex sitting on the couch. Alex quickly got up and followed his brother to the car after making sure to lock the door. Jacob was quiet, and so was Alex on the ride to school. Alex mentioned to Jacob that he had a volleyball game tonight, but would probably only play in the second quarter.. Jacob nodded, confirming he was told. Alex was quick to exit at the middle school, and Jacob relaxed a little once he got into the high school lot. Walking in to the school, Alex got a lot of second looks at his chest. If he were going to have a small chest, he could make it exciting he thought. Cary was the first to touch the titty dildo at lunch, which made Jacob&#39;s body shiver.<br />
<br />
Cary&#39;s eyes stared in initial disbelief, &quot;You felt that?&quot; Then Cary realized who he was talking to and laughed at himself. Jacob just nodded yes to Cary. Cary also noticed everyone checking out the unremarkable A-cup breasts as if they were a pair of generous DD-cups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come by tonight, and I&#39;ll show you,&quot; smiled Jacob.<br />
<br />
Cary grimaced and said, &quot;Sorry dude, I am spending tonight at Christy Nelson&#39;s house. Didn&#39;t Terry tell you? She said she was going to stay with you tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob thought for a moment, then looked around, &quot;Where are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cary shrugged, &quot;Dunno&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob worked out the situation for a few moments, and then said, &quot;You and Christy come to my place in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry walked up behind Jacob and wrapped her arms around his tits, grabbing the dildo between Jacob&#39;s tits with both hands. At first the touch was pleasant, but quickly became painful as Terry tried to pull the dildo away from Jacob&#39;s body. Jacob strugged for a moment, and eventually broke free of Terry&#39;s embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, I was just having fun. I mean, you are walking around school with a huge dildo on your chest, and I do like to touch your body.&quot; said Terry as she pouted at being denied her freedom to fondle Jacob&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Jacob asked Terry, &quot;Coming home with me tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry looked blank for a moment, and Christy smiled and chimed in, &quot;I think if you take Terry, then I can take Cary home.&quot; Terry smiled at her sister then to Jacob. It did not take a mind reader to know Cary had the hots for Christy. Terry was still working on Jacob, and she was determined to make him one of hers. Cary and Jacob both nursed from the girls and even orally serviced their shiny latex clad girlfriends. All four were curled together on a couple of the siesta sleeping mats when the bell rang for class to start. The twins went to class and Cary gave Jacob a good punch in the shoulder.<br />
<br />
Cary complained, &quot;What the hell dude, I didn&#39;t get an orgasm from that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled and thought about what the concept of hell was in this reality, which earned him another punch in the same shoulder.<br />
<br />
Cary grumbled then relaxed, &quot;I&#39;ll bring Christy over in the morning, but let&#39;s make it the late morning. I would prefer to sleep in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob laughed, &quot;I could use some sleep too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cary rolled his eyes, &quot;Not tonight you won&#39;t, not until you get Terry&#39;s appetite for you satisfied. Christy says she will not stop talking about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob questioned, &quot;She has not called me once on the phone, and I have been busy this week after school. Where did this inviting yourself thinking come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cary shrugged again, &quot;I don&#39;t know about that stuff, and besides, you need her right now, not me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded, Cary was right. Jacob never did get the relationship concept down clean. It was Cary to kept their relationship going in their past lifetime, but even that was in vain. Both knew this, but also know that they made plenty of bad choices they can atone for.<br />
<br />
Cary headed off to class and the rest of the school day was like Tuesday....long and slow for Jacob.<br />
<br />
Jacob was tired walking out to his car, where Terry was waiting. Jacob gave Terry a kiss, and Terry responded by fingering his pussy, a finger that went all the way in. Breaking the kiss slowly, Terry smiled, &quot;You cut holes in your pants now? You have a serious camel toe that is wanting me to play with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob had gone all day at school without vaginal contact. He was focused on his chest the hole day, and so was just about everyone else. Jacob now had a hunger for Terry&#39;s cock, and unlocked the car, &quot;Get in, &quot; he told her.<br />
<br />
Jacob drove quickly home and inside his house with Terry following him. Terry tacked Jacob on the living room rug, exposing her hard cock and aiming it up to slam into Jacob&#39;s now lubed pussy. It would take a couple of hours for her body to reach a point where she would go a few minutes before the uncontrollable urge to mount Jacob returned. At nearly 7 pm, they went to pick up Alex at the middle school. Alex walked up to the car with Jacob on top of Terry, riding her to another orgasm in his back seat. Alex put his stuff in the passenger seat, and then got sat down in the drivers seat, where he started the car and drove home. Jacob enjoyed the bumps and rough road, as it was a welcome jolt of the huge cock inside him.<br />
<br />
Alex did not say anything on the drive home, and went straight inside, and to his room. Jacob and Terry finally uncoupled a few minutes later and went into the house. Terry went to Jacob&#39;s room while Jacob was in the kitchen, and returned naked. As is custom here, she was giving herself to me as a promise gift, the only problem was she was performing the male portion of the custom.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you can promise yourself to me as a breeder or a birther, right?&quot; asked Jacob<br />
<br />
Terry shook her head in disagreement, &quot;I can do both and so can you. I want to be your breeder when the time comes. You can do the same to me if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob needed a moment to think. He had known this Terry for just a few days. Terry had known this Jacob for years. Jacob smiled, and kissed Terry&#39;s lips, and massaged one boob in each hand, &quot;Ok, when the time comes I shall be your breeder.&quot; Jacob knew that even though this was a  serious moment in his relationship with Terry.<br />
<br />
Alex came into the kitchen, tears in his eyes, but no longer crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....what happened?,&quot; asked Jacob.<br />
<br />
Alex took a breath, &quot;I was pulled from the game after I failed to get a spike sent right at me.&quot; Jacob knew this was normal, as it cost Alex&#39;s team a point and that made the coach unhappy.<br />
<br />
Jacob softly said, &quot;Coach will help you with that in practice. It&#39;s only your second game, and only a week of practice. You need to learn the skills to help with the natural talent you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, &quot;That&#39;s what the coach said, I would get plenty of practice with spikes.&quot; Alex grabbed three of the small eggs Jacob laid that morning and got a pan down to fry them.<br />
<br />
The clock next to the telephone said it was only 8:30. Terry reached over and was massaging Jacob&#39;s cock. With Alex busy cooking, Terry walked towards Jacob&#39;s bedroom, tugging Jacob&#39;s cock as they went.</p>
