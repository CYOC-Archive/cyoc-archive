<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before long, Debora and Jen were heading through the stacks of the library, heading towards the back.  The way the library was laid out was the main desk was in the front <br />
near the entrance followed by fifteen or so rows of books, reading tables, and study areas.  However, towards the back were three isolated, sound proof rooms where many <br />
students went to study if they didn't want to be annoyed by the occasional cough or sneeze of the Library inhabitants.  Making their way to the rooms, Debora was relieved to <br />
find one open for use and quickly took it, taking Jen in with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Jen listen.  I'm going to sit here and go over my dissertation.  I need you to look through this book here and book mark a few pictures for visual aids.&quot; said Debora as <br />
she plopped a textbook about a foot thick in front of the catgirl.  &quot;And please be quiet, I don't want any distractions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let's do our best,&quot; said Jen with a salute.  Debora only rolled her eyes before turning to her speech.<br />
<br />
The two girls sat silently for a few minutes before Jen began to notice something, Debora.  To the normal, teenage eye; Debora would have looked geeky with her long brown <br />
hair, thick black framed glasses, knee length skirt, black ankle socks, brown loafer-like shoes, gray sweater, and white collared shirt.  However, for some reason, Jen couldn't <br />
stop looking at her. Maybe Jen was attracted to Debora because she really didn't know much about her.  Jen was almost certain that underneath that, geeky studious shell, <br />
there was a really interesting person.  Suspecting this, Jen decided to strike up a conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Debora,&quot; began the catgirl.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; bit back the other girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you like to do in your spare time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's just that... I'm curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Curiousity killed the cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it didn't, did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, I know what you're trying to do, but right now is not the time.  Please let me do my work for the presentation.  I'll talk to you afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, it's a date,&quot; said Jen, who obviously didn't get the hint that Debora was not interested.  However, when Jen said that line, Debora's ears perked up.  Was she serious.  <br />
No, there was no way a girl like Jen would be interested in a girl like her.  I mean Jen was known to have a number of &quot;good friends&quot; already.  What were her chances of Jen ever <br />
liking her... wait, why did she want Jen to like her.  Debora shook her head, trying to get her mind on track.  However, the shaking of her hair only allowed her new cat ears to <br />
pierce the veil of hair easier, mounting themselves atop Debora's head like twin peaks on a mountain range.<br />
<br />
The two girls sat silently for a few more minutes.  However, Jen was soon disrupted by a series of sounds.  It sounded like brushing, then a stamp of some kind, only to return <br />
to brushing again a few seconds later.  Looking around, Jen couldn't see the source of the sound, however, in her movements, one of Jen's pencils fell from the desk and onto <br />
the floor.<br />
<br />
Debora then looked to Jen with a perfect &quot;what in the world are you doing&quot; face.  Jen only smiled as she rubbed the back of her head.  &quot;I'll just get that,&quot; said the cheerleader as <br />
she ducked under the table to get the pencil.  <br />
<br />
Under the table, Jen easily found the yellow pencil and was about to surface when the brushing started up again.  This time it was closer and she stopped look.  The sound was <br />
actually coming from Debora, well her feet to be precise as she would slipped knee-length argyle socked feet in and out of her shoes before stamping them back on, as if half <br />
of her wanted to wear shoes while the other wished them gone.  Jen smiled.  &quot;I'll do her a kindness and get rid of those ugly shoes,&quot; said Jen as she quickly grabbed both of <br />
Debora's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what are you doing down there,&quot; asked the geek as she ducked her head under the table to see what had captured her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just this,&quot; said Jen as she ripped off both of Debora's shoes before throwing them to the far side of the room, revealing that Debora's socks were indeed argyle even down to <br />
the pink diamonds which stretched from her toes to her knees.  <br />
<br />
Debora tried to object but instead found herself much more comfortable.  See wiggled her toes happily, before letting them glide along the green carpet of the room.  Debora <br />
managed to utter a passive, &quot;thank you&quot;, blushing and returning to her speech which to her surprise she was having more trouble focusing on.  It wasn't just the almost sudden <br />
jump in difficulty of words, words that she had typed up herself two nights before, but it was also the fact her mind kept wandering.  Wandering to the taste of fish, the glories <br />
of a warm summer day, and to Jen.  The more Debora thought about her, the more Debora found herself wanting to be like Jen.  No it wasn't that.  She wanted to be with Jen.  <br />
Yet, Debora returned to her text, not knowing that she was fighting a losing battle.<br />
<br />
Another few minutes passed after Jen regained her seat, before something happened.  Feeling hot in her sweater, Debora abruptly tore off her sweater and threw it across the <br />
room, watching it land near her shoes.  Jen was surprised to she just how hot Debora had been.  Sweat had already made its mark across Debora's chest, revealing her pink bra <br />
she wore through the soaked white shirt.  Debora, noticed Jen's peering eyes and looked down.  Debora squeaked like a mouse when she saw how revealed she was and yet did <br />
nothing to cover up.  If anything, she made herself more exposed as she unbuttoned her first two buttons, allowing her actual breasts their first taste of freedom.<br />
<br />
Not long after that, Jen's eyes had traveled to Debora again except this time to her hind quarters.  She didn't know when it had started, but slowly, Debora had obtained a long <br />
beautiful tail that was happily flicking behind her.  However, the tail had taken the high rung of the chair as its resting place, lifting Debora's skirt just enough to give Jen a <br />
fraction of a sight of Debora's thigh.  Curious at what she would find there, Jen slowly let her tail approach and lift up a side of the skirt.  Jen giggled slightly at Debora's <br />
adorable pink panties.  She wanted to see more.  Focusing on directing her tail, Jen did not notice that Debora had seen her movements.  Debora found Jen's tail flirting to be  <br />
oddly adorable... and hot.  She blushed madly at the thoughts that flooded into her mind, the two of them naked, experiencing each other's curves and bodies.  It seemed like <br />
a dream but it was happening. Debora dared not disrupt the girl she loved in her attempt to discover her... at least not yet.  <br />
<br />
Slowly, Jen's tail rounded Debora's thigh, brushing the top of her now thigh high argyle socks, before reaching her goal of the girl's panties.  &quot;T... T... Tell me Jen,&quot; stuttered <br />
Debora as she laid a hand on Jen's tail.  &quot;D... D... Do you want...&quot;  Jen waited for the shy girl to finish.  &quot;D... D... Do you want t... t... to see my panties,&quot; managed Debora.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you wouldn't mind showing me,&quot; said Jen as she turned her chair towards the girl.  Slowly Debora stood up and grabbed the buckle of her skirt.  Her hands froze.  Was she <br />
really ready for this?  Was she really certain about this?  Debora was tired of being left out.  Tired of not getting the girl she wanted.  She wanted to be the one to say yes.  It <br />
was now or never.  Grabbing the buckle, Debora quickly undid the latch and let her skirt drop, revealing her pink panties.<br />
<br />
Before Debora could say another word, she found her lips interlocked with someone else's.  It was Jen.  The two catgirls embraced and quickly started enjoying the other, <br />
letting each other's tongue taste the other's, each wanting more and more with each passing moment.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jen pushed forward and Debora's sweaty, socked feet slipped on the carpet causing them to fall.  Jen protected Debora as they fell, but they were no doubt shaken <br />
when their heads banged together as they hit the ground.  After a moment of rubbing their heads for recovery, The two catgirls looked at where they were.  Jen's panties were <br />
now rubbing against Debora's as Debora's shirt now lay open to Jen's exploration.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; said Jen  as she looked at the blushing Debora.  &quot;I feel this is a little unfair.&quot;  Jenn then took the top of her cheerleading uniform and tugged it off, her breasts left <br />
to bounce happily for a second.  However, there true freedom was only realized when Jen undid her bra, casting it aside like the other clothing in the room.  Reaching to her <br />
skirt, Jen also took off her skirt revealing her light blue panties to Debora who was desperately trying not to orgasm too soon.  Jen smirked, she wanted to up the ante.  Pulling <br />
down on her panties, Jen was soon only clothed in her thigh-high green and yellow stripped toes socks.  &quot;Care to join me?&quot; asked Jen, to the blushing Debora.  Debora only <br />
gave a nod and Jen moved in.  First came Debora's bra, freeing her size B breasts.  next was Debora's white shirt which almost faded off as the two prepared for the plunge.  <br />
And finally, Jen tugged ever so slightly on Debora's panties till finally freeing the girl to the freedom of near nudity.<br />
<br />
However, Jen was not the first to make a move.  Tired of being passive, Debora wound her tail around Jen's leg and plunged it deep into Jen's exposed self.  The catgirl moaned <br />
in sudden surprise and ecstasy.  Quickly wanting to return the favor, Jen leaned down and took one of Debora's nipples into her firm lips, twisting it ever so slightly to evoke <br />
the most enchanting moans from the girl below her.  Leading her hand down Debora's anatomy, Jen slowly started rubbing Debora's chest preparing her for the fun they would <br />
have.  Debora leaned up as best as she could and kissed Jenn on the lips, wanting to taste more of her love.  However, a sudden force of pleasure billowed up from below, <br />
forced the girl down onto the carpet and to arch her back.  Jen had taken Debora's lead from her and plunged her own tail deep into her love, slowly back in and out like a <br />
lovely couple.  Soon the girls got into a rhythm, up and down they went, each changing ever so slightly to experience a different facet of the girl in their arms, each time <br />
wanting to know the other girl better.  Eventually, the two girls came, and Jen rolled off of Debora allowing the girl to breathe again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing Debora,&quot; said Jen as she breathed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good for a first time,&quot; answered Debora with the best smirk she could manage through her gasping breathes.  &quot;Oh and just call me Deb.  All my friends call me that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do Deb,&quot; said Jen as she kissed her new friend, their feet brushing together.<br />
<br />
The rest of the period, the two catgirls spent talking about things.  Family, life, and other things they found important.  However, the bell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no Jen, our presentation,&quot; said Deb.  &quot;What are we going to do?  I'm all sticky and so are you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention we still need to get dressed,&quot; said the cheerleader as she helped Debora up from the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; answered Deb.  &quot;What are we going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; said Jen, &quot;We'll get through this, you can count on it.&quot;</p>
