<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim’s shock was so great his shrunken penis had let out a short burst of piss into the floor half a second before everything zapped light green. But amazingly enough, the gun hadn’t killed him. The realization that would come next though, would make part of him wish it had.<br />
<br />
Tim Enderson couldn’t move. It was no longer that he was being held at gunpoint but rather he had seemed to lose that capability. For some reason, he was now staring into the ceiling. He tried looking down but his neck didn’t respond. His eyes glanced downward but he only saw his naked chest laying down. Which was weird because seconds ago he was standing up. Even weirder was the current sorry state of his limbs, which were bent behind his torso in a most unnatural position. He was in all fours with his belly pointing up, his mouth and his anus spread wide open, his dick with the biggest hardon he had ever had in his life and... Wait, what?<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
“Yay! My first recreation room item!” Mr. Wheeler’s eyes spinned at full speed. He came running to the recently transformed coat hanger and looked at it with with his mouth hanging open. “Woah! I have no fucking idea what this is!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be silly, this is clearly a...” Agent paused for a bit as he consulted his notes. “...A pool table!”<br />
<br />
“A pool table! Wow! I have a pool table!” Mr. Wheeler ran towards the pink pool table and rubbed his eyes on it, not believing his luck.<br />
Agent looked at his handiwork. Unfortunately there were still some visible traces of the old coat hanger remaining on the pool table like the strands of black mold all over it but it shouldn’t affect its usability.<br />
<br />
“And how do you have fun with an Earthian pool table?” Mr. Wheeler asked, still spinning with joy.<br />
“(<i>Like with any other table,)</i>” The agent’s anus responded. “(<i>you put your bitch on top and you fuck their ass. If I was the one controlling the rest of my body I’d fuck your mouth though so you’d keep your yapping hole silent for a change</i>.)”<br />
“Hey! He was asking *me*!” Agent reprimanded. “A pool table is damn easy to use. See its holes?”<br />
Mr. Wheeler observed the gaping holes on the fleshy table. “Yeah, one on top, the other on the bottom. They’re both quite big!”<br />
Agent picked up two round balls. “The main objective of the game is to insert the balls into the holes.”<br />
“Oh, I understand!” The shorter alien said. “But wait, wouldn’t that be too easy? You just have to drop the balls into the holes, like this, right?” The short alien took one of the balls from Agent and let it fall into one of the holes.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
What the fuck had happened to him?! The alien in a trench coat had just picked up his balls, detaching them away from his body like nothing! Worse still, he could still felt the alien holding on to them in his forceful grip! How was that possible?!<br />
<br />
His balls had not only detached away from his body but from each other too! They had been enlarged, filled with cum that had no way to come out from them, and each was enveloped in a scrotum-like individual hairy sack.<br />
<br />
And the aliens were handling them like they were their property! Tim attempted to cry out but his mouth was wide open in an O-shape and couldn’t move it, much less make any sound through it!<br />
<br />
The short, chubby alien took hold on one of his balls and placed it right on top of his eyes... No... Right on top of his mouth!<br />
<br />
Mr. Enderson was correctly guessing what was about to happen but couldn’t possibly accept it.<br />
<br />
The round alien let go of his testicle and it fell right inside his wide open mouth. Tim could feel (and taste!) the pubic hair on his tongue and the sweat of his cum-filled testicle.<br />
<br />
The alien in the trenchcoat put his claws into Tim’s mouth and took the ball out without any consideration towards the legitimate owner of the testicle. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
“Nope, that’d be too simple. You can’t pick up and drop the balls with your hands. You’re supposed to use this stick.” Agent explained.<br />
“Oooooh!”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Then Mr. Enderson put its claws on Tim’s detached shaft. If his testicles had been unnaturally enlarged, his dick had been stretched to the most outrageous limit. It was extremely hard and sensitive but with his balls detached there was no way at all for Tim Enderson to feel relief no matter how much the alien manhandled his genitals.<br />
<br />
The tall alien placed his balls one right next to the other. Then with a fierce grip on his dick it adopted a pro pool player stance... Oh FUCK! That’s when Tim realized his fate. He was a human pool table, with his testicles acting as makeshift pool balls and the alien was about to shoot towards the opposite hole on his rectangular fleshy inanimate body: his anus.<br />
<br />
“<i>(NOOOOOOOO!)</i>”<br />
<br />
The tip of his dick pushed painfully against his testicle which in turned impact against the other testicle, which caused it to be shot straight into between Tim’s buttcheeks. The enlarged ball went in so deep it got stuck painfully in his rectum.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
“Impressive! I’m sure I’ll have lots of fun in this recreation room. I can’t wait to redecorate all the other rooms! Earthian culture is so fascinating! Thanks for your help, Agent!”<br />
“No problem, just doing my job here.” The Agent looked at the hard work he had made. The room looked like a proper Earthian recreation room now thanks to the pool table, the dartboard, and the mini golf course. He was about to leave when he tripped with the pool table stick and it fell to the floor. Fearing the mold on the surface of the pool table would extend to the stick, he placed the bigger pink end inside one of the holes, the one with fleshy lips.</p>
