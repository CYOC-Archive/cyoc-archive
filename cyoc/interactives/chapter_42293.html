<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allison found herself in a strange forest. The trees appeared to be dead, the ground was covered in fog, and there was little light. It was a rather gloomy place to be. She wrapped her arms around herself and realized that she wasn't in her magical girl form. She knew that there was something wrong here but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. She finally figured it out when she couldn't feel her necklace against her skin. It should have been there. Upon that realization she also realized that her shoulder wasn't hurting anymore. &quot;Oh no&quot; she said out loud. &quot;I must be possessed now. The demonic wolf is in control of my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking around she decided that she might as well explore her surroundings. Maybe she could find a way to regain control of her body. She set off in a random direction fully expecting something to jump out at her from behind a tree.<br />
<br />
She walked for what seemed like an hour when she came to the edge of the forest. What she saw in front of her was even eerier than the forest had been. There was a crumbling mausoleum covered with mold in a graveyard with crumbling headstones. The graveyard was overgrown with dead or nearly dead weeds. The iron fence around it was rusted and twisted. The iron gate was in the same shape as the rest of the fence and it hung open on what looked to be a rusty hinge. There was a single withered tree near two headstones that were by themselves. Despite the feeling the graveyard gave her she decided to go take a look.<br />
<br />
Being careful not to touch the gate for fear that it would fall if she did she slipped inside and went to the two headstones by themselves. On the way she stumbled a few times on hidden headstones that had crumbled nearly to the ground. She finally made it and noticed that these headstones weren't as crumbled as the rest and the graves appeared to be fresh. The names on the headstones were Elizabeth and Michael. The last names were almost impossible to read but they looked similar. Then there was the &quot;DEVOTED WIFE AND MOTHER&quot; on Elizabeth's headstone and the &quot;DEVOTED HUSBAND AND FATHER&quot; on Michael's. It was obvious that they had been husband and wife.<br />
<br />
Kneeling down she tried to make sense of the last name on the headstones. She traced one and stood back up in shock. If she wasn't mistaken these were her parent's graves. That couldn't be though as the cemetery they were buried in didn't look anything like this graveyard. Suddenly a hand sprang up from her dad's grave and grabbed her right ankle. She let out an earsplitting shriek and managed to free herself. She stumbled back and fell on her butt as her mom and dad rose from their graves.<br />
<br />
She had nightmares about her parents leaving her but they looked like the last time she had seen them. She had never seen their bodies as the funeral was a closed casket one. Now she understood why if what she was seeing now was what they looked like after the accident. They both had deep cuts to their faces, some showing bone. Her mom's head flopped around since it had been partially severed. Her left ear had also been severed as had her left arm but that had been sewn back on. Her dad had a huge gapping hole in his chest.<br />
<br />
Her parents had fully risen from their graves and with her heart pounding in fear she's able to stand and run. She manages to avoid tripping over any of the hidden headstones. As she left the graveyard she bumped into the gate and it fell with aloud crash. She ran to the forest without looking back and kept on running for what seemed like an hour.<br />
<br />
She stopped to catch her breath and that's when she saw the demonic wolf. It was horrifying to see. It's eyes glowed yellow and there was drool dripping from it's muzzle. It only had small patches of fur on it's body. It's skin was red and bubbly and smoking. What skin it had at least for she could see the bone of it's ribs and legs. She could even see it's spine and skull.<br />
<br />
She turned to her right and ran like her life depended on it. She didn't get far however as she tripped on an exposed root and went sprawling to the ground. She flipped over onto her back and saw the demonic wolf stalking toward her. She scrambled back. Her hand found a thick branch just as the wolf lunged at her with it's fangs bared. She was able to bring the branch up and the wolf bit that instead of her. This gave her a few seconds and she used that to get up and run.<br />
<br />
She ran for about twenty minutes all the while hearing the wolf stalking her. She found a clearing and was halfway across it when she tripped over a branch hidden by the fog. Before she could get up four hands stripped her of her dress, shoes, socks, panties, and bra. She was then hauled to her feet and turned around to face the approaching wolf. It was during this time that she saw who had hold of her and her heart jumped into her throat. Her parents were holding her for the wolf. Her dad was on her right and her mom on her left.<br />
<br />
Her dad leaned toward her face and he said &quot;There's nowhere to run.&quot; His breath was so foul that she gagged and thought she would lose her lunch. She noticed however that his voice didn't sound like his at all. It was guttural, animalistic, and demonic all at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You put up a fight&quot; her mom said in that same voice. &quot;Now though the game is done and I win.&quot; She noticed the wolf smile when her mom had spoken. This unnerved her and she just froze out of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; her dad said. &quot;Accept your fate. You are a part of the pack unlike that group of magical girls. You were never part of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll enjoy being a part of the great Zamdarr's pack&quot; her mom said. &quot;All that I have to do is to devour you. You have such a strong will and spirit that we'll be the great Zamdarr's second in command. He may even pick us to be his mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stared wide eyed at the wolf as it came closer. Her parents were holding her so tight that she didn't think she could get away. It was pointless considering it anyway as she was paralyzed by sheer terror. She closed her eyes and awaited what would happen to her.</p>
