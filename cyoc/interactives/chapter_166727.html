<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s heart seamed to stop mid beat as his blood turned to ice as he turned toward which one of these horsemen had “claimed” him. He turned to see the tall beautiful women with olive skin and pale yellow hair. She titled her head and leaned forward kissing him on the forehead.<br />
“NO!!!” yelled Jeff as he tried to remember who was this woman, he recalled her name was Limos, as he looked at the rotten apple in her hand. His mind filled the answer, she was the horsemen or horsewoman of famine. <br />
“It is too late.” said Limos as Jeff also remembered that she had said she wanted a daughter. His eyes widened as his heart rate started racing again. He felt something brush his shoulders and somehow he knew that his short brown hair was now a shoulder length pixie cut which he knew was now green. He looked down feeling his face change as he looked down. His T-shirt and blue jeans where gone as he felt warm air go past his legs. He was not nude but instead he wore a deep dark green cocktail dress with an open back and a deep V cut which went down to his bellybutton with small straps in the shape of dead leaves holding the top together. <br />
He looked down in horror as he watched a pair of breasts begin to fill the cocktail dress, they grew and grew until they had to be a good C cup breasts filling the dress. He felt his frame shirk down as his broad shoulders shrunk as his brown skin became perfect smooth as the little bit of facial hair he had fell away. <br />
He raised his hand to his face shielding his eyes from what he was becoming even as a snake’s head broach appeared at his now Adam’s apple free throat. <br />
“My name is Jeff…my mother’s name is Mary…my father’s name is…” started Jeff as he tried to name his father and instead of his father face. A dark-skinned man with scales over part of his body appeared, he had never seen this man before but yet he knew him.<br />
“Is Nahas.” Said Jeff his voice sounded more feminine as he somehow knew that this man, well snake make was named Nahas and he was a Duke of Hell. He was only a Duke which wasn’t that high up in the social ladder of the court, but he was the one who had temped the first humans with the apple in the garden earning him a higher position then most Lords of Hell. His wife, was the General goddess of Feminine who sat 4th on the command structure of the armies of hell behind, King Lucifer, Death and War. Her position in court was well established, her father a hero and her mother a top general. She was also best friends with the future Queen of this Hell and her cousin the daughter of Death, the three of them where inseparable friends. <br />
“NO…I am a man not a….” started Jeff as one of his hands shot down to his crotch to gab his junk so that he could feel his manhood, he felt the smooth slit of womenhood instead.<br />
“I am a woman.” Said Jeff as his body kept changing, some green scales appeared around her hands and legs stopping at below the elbows and knees, giving her the look of wearing stockings and gloves.<br />
“I am…” panted Jeff as he felt the last bit of his humanity go away as two snapping poison filled fangs grew in her mouth.<br />
“My beautiful daughter.” Said Limos with a smile as Jeff stood up tall, when she was human she had been rather tall but now she was extremely tall for a women and even compared to men she was tall. She had inherited the snake like traits from her father, but she was tall and impossibly thin like her mother. Her face also shared a lot of traits with her mother as her eyes turned from a brown to a deep dark green.<br />
“I should thank you for my looks mother, I got them from you.” Said Jeff in her new voice, she embraced her “new” mother.<br />
“I shall call you Jahi.” Announced Limos as she kissed her new daughter on the forehead. “Now go join your friends.”<br />
“Yes, mother.” Confirmed the newly named Jahi as she moved toward her friends, she was by far the tallest but she embraced both of them and they embraced her. The three former high school male friends had all become Ladies in the Court of Lucifer King of Hell and ruler of Earth.</p>
