<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was much easier for Abby to navigate the cave now that her eyes had changed.  The cave no longer seemed so dark, and she could see everything. But she still almost doubted her eyes when she saw Jim gently massaging one of Sandra&#39;s paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, what the hell are you doing?&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jim, how could you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You traitor!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim looked up at the new monster and jumped behind Sandra for protection.  Abby couldn&#39;t believe it.  She hadn&#39;t expected him to run into her arms when she looked like this, but she hadn&#39;t expected him to run into Sandra&#39;s arms for protection instead.  It was almost like they were friends or something.  Her eyes narrowed as she glared at Sandra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well.  Looks like somebody just couldn&#39;t resist playing with the vials.  I knew I shouldn&#39;t have trusted a little  insolent whelp like you, &quot; said Sandra.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are one to talk, SANDRA, &quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  We aren&#39;t that little anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, oh Jim.  Please come back to me. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby? Is that you?  What happened?&quot; asked Jim, as he crawled back out of Sandra&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind,&quot; said Abby angrily.  She was still a little hurt by Jim&#39;s betrayal.  But she still wanted him back.  She needed him to return to normal.  &quot;Just give me Jim, and there won&#39;t be any trouble.  You don&#39;t have to get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  No!  I want to fight!  That bitch deserves it, and I want to see how strong we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, be rational. We need Jim alive and unharmed.  He could get hurt in a fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  Please don&#39;t hurt him!  I need him!  I will do anything if you just leave Jim alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra stared at the heads curiously.  It seemed like they didn&#39;t agree, almost like they didn&#39;t think alike. Sandra quietly chuckled, realizing that Abby got a little bit more than she expected with her transformation.  She  smiled wickedly, and decided to use it to her advantage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, take him, &quot; said Sandra, as she nudged Jim gently forward.  &quot;He is yours, after all.  I wasn&#39;t going to hurt him. It was just a bluff to ensure you would return.  I&#39;m not a monster, after all.  By the way,where is the box ?  Did you bring it with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try, &quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we are not that stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, please come to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim stood reluctantly between the two massive beasts.  He didn&#39;t know who to trust or where to go.  He loved Abby, but she didn&#39;t seem quite like herself.  The dragon had held him captive, but she had been pretty nice and treated him well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, girls.  There is no reason to fight.  We&#39;re all friends here. Let&#39;s talk about this, &quot; said Jim.<br />
<br />
Abby scoffed.  &quot;Friends?  That thing is a monster!  I risked my life .... No, I sacrificed my body to save you from her, and you have the gall to try to defend her. The monster that kept you as a prisoner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you rotten traitor! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.  Must be some type of Stockholm syndrome.  We have to get him out of here quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes.  Oh Jim.  I love you, please come to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s not like that, &quot; said Jim, a little confused by the different talking heads.  It was like having four conversations  with four different people at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go, Jim.  They have obviously already made up their minds.  Just give Abby what she wants.  I don&#39;t want any trouble, &quot; said Sandra.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right you don&#39;t.  Our powerful body would rip yours to shreds.  You don&#39;t want a piece of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby was a little shocked.  One of the heads was speaking out of turn, speaking for all of them.  She could feel a tingle in her arm, almost like it was trying to move it.  She didn&#39;t like this.  She wanted to return to normal as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Jim.  Let&#39;s go.  I don&#39;t want to stay here any longer than I have to, &quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Jim.  Please hurry.  Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim ducked his head and began to slowly walk forward. Sandra smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess you are going to change back as soon as you leave. That&#39;s kind of a shame.  That body looks like a lot of fun. All that power, all that strength.  But since you won and have Jim back, there is no reason to stay that way,&quot; said Sandra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not!  As soon as we get out of here, I am changing back to my normal human body,  &quot; said Abby. <br />
<br />
&quot;Awww.  But we have barely spent any time like this.  I didn&#39;t really even get a chance to try this body out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.  Logically we should wait until we are far from Sandra before we change.  It might be prudent to stay this way a bit longer, until we can be sure we are truly safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care.  I just want Jim. I&#39;ll do anything to be with him.  Human or Hydra it makes no difference to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra chuckled.  &quot;It seems like we have a little difference of opinion.  Maybe you girls should talk it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing to talk about.  I am in charge, and it&#39;s my decision,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Says who? Who put you in charge? Why are you so much better than one of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I assumed we all had an equal say. But perhaps you are right.  I think Sandra is trying to trick us.  We best return to normal before she tries .....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, come to me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, if you tell me where the vials are I can help.  I can make it so that you stay that way a little longer.  Forever if you like, &quot; said Sandra.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are in a bush just to the right of the cave entrance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You traitor!&quot; said Abby angrily.  &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You fool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t fight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby and her three heads began to squabble loudly.  Sandra used the distraction to make her escape.  She nudged Jim as she passed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Jim.  We have to get out of here.  They are crazy!  We have to get out of here before they hurt someone, &quot; said Sandra.<br />
<br />
Jim stared at the beast that used to be his girlfriend. The heads continued to fight, but it was getting more vicious.  One of the heads snapped at another one.  Sandra was right.  This was getting out of control.  Sandra had treated him fairly before, so he trusted her. He nodded his head and followed her out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fool!  You are playing right into her hand!  Stop acting like an idiot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An idiot!  I&#39;ll show you an idiot! &quot; snarled the angry head, as it nicked the throat of the head Abby came to see as the logical rational one. &quot;If you are so much better than me, why didn&#39;t you see that coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
A thin stream of blood shot from the neck of the logical head.  The angry feisty head looked shocked.  It hadn&#39;t intended to do that much damage, but it had just lost control in its anger.  <br />
<br />
The logical head turned to face its attacker, and tried to fight back.  But the loss of blood made it slow and weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!  It was an accident!  Stop that!&quot; said the angry head, as it dodged the feeble attacks of the bleeding head.  Finally, it grew tired of the attacks, and shot forward tearing the other head off at the neck.<br />
<br />
Abby stared in shock at the angry head.  She felt no pain.  Apparently the different heads shared no nerves above the neck.  But it was still disturbing.  <br />
<br />
The angry head looked at them with pleading eyes, begging for forgiveness.  &quot;I had to!  It was her or me!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Abby and the loving head just looked at her with a mixture of shame and fear.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t look at me that way!&quot; said the angry head.  &quot;Unless you want to be next!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the bloody stump began to quiver.  They all watched as the stump grew longer, eventually splitting and growing two new heads.  One of the heads had an enlarged forehead.  It moved slowly and gracefully, as if deep in thought.  The other head had a low sloped forehead.  It had a more bestial appearance, with strange twisted horns and jagged teeth.  It began snapping its jaw wildly in a feral state.  It picked up one of the bones off the floor and snapped it easily in two in its jaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s more like it,&quot; said the angry head. &quot;I like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it!  We have to stop fighting and work together, &quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  Where is Jim?&quot; said the loving head, as it frantically scanned the cave.<br />
<br />
The new more intelligent head sighed.  &quot;Sandra obviously took her with him, when she distracted you all with her simple ruse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what are we waiting for?  Let&#39;s go get her, &quot; said the angry head.<br />
<br />
It was one thing they could all agree on, even the feral head.  They stomped out the cave, ready to face off with Sandra once again.</p>
