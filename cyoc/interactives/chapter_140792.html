<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;d love to see the Things that other People can come up with.<br/>
What happens to Goh? Do you care? You decide.<br/>
I&#39;ll probably post a new Chapter once in a while. (I hope you like it.)<br/>
You should be able to just skip to the last three Sentences if you don&#39;t care about backstory.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This is the Story of Gohrion Grey&#39;s Life, from his Birth, to the current Day, <br />
<br />
Gohrion was born 5 Years after his older Brother and 3 Years before his younger Sister, on the Continent of Maeminia.<br />
He was born to the Butcher Abbas, a green skinned, brown eyed Orc, who&#39;s Tribe had been living in the nearby Mountains for centurys<br />
and the Seamstress Sharn Grey, a gray skinned Orc with Eyes that had a striking golden colour.<br />
Gray was a common Name for gray skinned Orcs, as the slavery of most intelligent Races, including Orcs, who were popular Slaves due to their enormous strength and Livespans of around 160 Years, had only been outlawed on the Continent a few Generations ago.<br />
Gohrion was born in a time of peace, that hadn&#39;t been seen on Maeminia for more than 70 Years.<br />
He had the Gray-ish Skin and Golden Eyes of his Mother and the black Hair of his Father.<br />
His education was given to him by his Mother, who taught his Siblings and him things like basic Math, reading, writing and sewing.<br />
He was an exceptional Student, but his Mother was unable to teach him more, as her own Knowledge was mostly self-taught.<br />
The things taught to Gohrion by his Father were much more practical, like hunting, butchering Animals, fighting and bartering.<br />
He was happy with the Thought of becoming a Butcher like his Father, or maybe a Hunter, until the Year he turned nine.<br />
That Year was destined to become a Turning Point in Gohrions Life.<br />
It was a Day as any other, until Gohrion saw a Group of Adventurers, that included a Man who was wearing a Robe and wielding a strange Staff, walking into Town. The Group was in a somewhat rough shape, most of them having bruises all over their Bodies.<br />
Gohrion thought that they looked a bit strange, out of place even, but didn&#39;t think he would ever see them again.<br />
He didn&#39;t expect to see the Man with the strange Staff in his Mother&#39;s Store.<br />
The Man, who he learned was an aspiring Wizard, was there to have his Robe fixed, but ended up having a Conversation with Gohrion,<br />
that continued for far longer than his Mother needed to fix the Robe.<br />
The Man, who seemed to like Gohrion, claimed that he had the Potential to become an outstanding Wizard someday and regretted,<br />
that he couldn&#39;t take the Youth in as an Apprentice, as he was still being taught by a Master himself.<br />
Gohrion didn&#39;t know if the Man was right about him having Potential, but becoming a Wizard became his greatest Wish,<br />
from that Day on.<br />
Sadly, Gohrions Family simply didn&#39;t have the Wealth to support his Studies, forcing him to give up his Dream,<br />
until he could earn the significant amount of Money required to fund it.<br />
He stayed with his Family until he became an adult and did his best to suppress his Desire to leave his Hometown,<br />
until he left, at the age of 23, to pursue his Dream of becomming a Wizard.<br />
The Jobs he had throughout the following Years included, in no specific order:<br />
Butcher, Hunter, Cook, Guard, Gladiator, Mercenary, Gigolo, Clothier, Thief, Smuggler, Gravedigger and finally Adventurer.<br />
He always spent his Savings on learning Magic, but never did become a Wizard.<br />
He discovered, that he was already too old to be taken in as an Apprentice, by the time he left home.<br />
This Fact impacted him greatly, but didn&#39;t discourage him from learning Magic.<br />
His theoretical Skill ended up far surpassing some actual Wizards, but his practical Skill never went that far beyond a simple Fireball.<br />
<br />
That brings us to Yesterday.<br />
Gohrion, the 53 Year old Spellblade, had just entered the City of Newage.<br />
The Name Newage was Chosen for the City, because it was supposed to be a City built by many different Races and Cultures.<br />
A City where everyone was accepted, as long as they respected the Law, and a Place where new Ideas and Inventions could flourish.<br />
No one expected the City to become what it was supposed to be, but it somehow really did.<br />
Grand Ideas, like this City, were always nice in Theory, but rarely succeeded in reality, <br />
but Newage ended up becoming one of Maeminia&#39;s wealthiest and it&#39;s, by far, most technologically advanced City.<br />
Gohrion always thought, that &#39;Newage&#39; was far too cheesy a Name for such an impressive City,<br />
but that never prevented him from enjoying his stay here wholeheartedly.<br />
He marveled every time, how the Architects of the City managed to merge the Architecture of so many different Cultures and Races,<br />
without making it look like a horrible Mess.<br />
Newage was likely the only Place on Maeminia, where you could see an elvish Tree of Life growing out of a dwarven Building.<br />
It even had running Water and free Education, Things that would be unthinkable anywhere else.<br />
Gohrion had come here to track down a Criminal, who had escaped his sentence and thought that hiding in a Temple was a good Idea.<br />
It only took Gohrion 3 Houres to find the Man and hand him over to the Guards.<br />
He didn&#39;t have any other business in the City and decided to go to someone that he visited every time he came to Newage, Deidre.<br />
Deidre was an Escort in Newage who, despite her popularity, rarely had sex with her Customers, Gohrion being one of the few Exeptions.<br />
<br />
That brings us to Today.<br />
Gohrion had just woken up, when he noticed that something felt... off.<br />
He lifted his Hand and was alarmed by how small it looked.<br />
He immediatly jumped out of the Bed and ran to the Mirror he saw, at the other side of the Room.<br />
What he saw was someone who looked like he did when he was 9, but with less musculature and a somewhat effeminate look.<br />
If he had to describe the Figure, then he would likely call him a cute little Kid, that probably never had to suffer any hardship.<br />
It took a while for Gohrion to understand that: A) This cute little Kid is him. B) He isn&#39;t Dreaming. And C) This isn&#39;t a Curse.<br />
If Gohrion was cursed by someone then he would be confident in easily undoing it, but this is different.<br />
He had been changed on a fundamental Level, even powerful Magic would see him as nothing other than the Child, he now was to be.<br />
His Mind began to race, who could have done this? Whoever did this must have been considerably powerful.<br />
Why would anyone do this? It would be far easier to just kill him, with that much Power.<br />
But then he remembered Yesterday.<br />
He had damaged a few Things in the Temple, as he was dragging the Criminal out.<br />
He also remembered that the Temple belonged to Khalios, the God of Birth, Rebirth and Redemption,<br />
as well as Patron God of Children and pregnant Women.<br />
Gohrion suddered, as he realized that he had angered a God.<br />
His Luck was already good, compared to what happens to most People who damage Shrines of some of the more &#39;active&#39; Gods.<br />
He was still staring at his Reflection, as he heard someone call him from the Bathroom.<br />
&quot;Goh? Is that you?&quot;<br />
Gohrion was startled, Deidre was still here and about to see a naked Kid, who vaguely resembeled him, standing in her Bedroom.<br />
<br />
And that finally brings us to now.<br />
Gohrion is a naked little kid, standing in the Bedroom of one of his best Friends, who he had just had sex with a few Houres ago.<br />
He has never faced such a strange Situation in all of his 53 Years.</p>
