<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Commander Weiss,&quot; someone called,&quot;We have a human here.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a young private from my division. The 42nd Division to be exact.<br />
<br />
Yes, the famous &quot;Rainbow Division&quot; was under my command. And, much to the <br />
distaste of the Single World Government, it had sided with the anthros.<br />
<br />
Though myself and many of my men were anthros, not all of my troops were. Some <br />
were anthro sympathizers, others family of anthros, and others who were not willing to <br />
turn against their brothers in arms over a physical difference. <br />
<br />
Things had been going badly for the Resistance. Even though we had the physical <br />
advantages, the SWG had many more troops and weapons. Fortunately, they had not <br />
resorted to nuclear weapons to eradicate our kind. <br />
<br />
However, I fully expected a quick turnabout. Buford Spalling had been assasinated, by <br />
a human no less, and the SWG was slowly reverting to the independent countries it <br />
had once been. And after an inner rebellion in the United States of America, the <br />
people finally had control over their government again. <br />
<br />
This is not to say they accepted us any more than before. No we were still at war. But <br />
now it wasn't so much a hate war, but a war for dominance. <br />
<br />
This human was a problem. We had attempted to keep out of human business, they <br />
tended to lash out as soon as we had helped them. But no matter how hard we tried, <br />
we could not pass an innocent in need. <br />
<br />
This particular man had been found in a car crash as the private was telling me, but, <br />
on second thought, why don't I just let him tell you?<br />
<br />
&quot;...And he was the only survivor. The rest of the vehicle's occupants were dead on our <br />
men's arrival. The automobile was armored, so we figure he must have been someone <br />
of importance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, young fox,&quot; I instructed the vulpine, &quot;Leave him here on the bed and alert <br />
a doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And once you've done that, could you please send for General Natopt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dismissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the increase in injuries lately as we began another campaign, my office/room had <br />
been converted to an extra hospital wing due to its size and convenient proximity to <br />
the actual infirmary. <br />
<br />
There was something about this man that looked familiar. But with all the blood I <br />
couldn't place my finger on it. General George Natopt would have profiles on any <br />
person of interest. <br />
<br />
The doctor armadillo arrived and began his practice with a young raccoon nurse. Not <br />
afraid of blood, but thinking it better to leave them alone, I walked out into the hall. <br />
<br />
General Natopt arrived with his files on human authority figures. I was able to narrow it <br />
down to two possibilities. After all the blood was gone, we could verify our findings. I <br />
believed the man to be either the SWG's attorney general, or the new President of the <br />
United States. I myself hoped it would be the latter, seeing as anyone from the SWG <br />
would be difficult to work with. <br />
<br />
The doctor exited the room and allowed us to enter. The man was coming to, but was <br />
hooked up to at least three machines. He looked up as we entered and I knew it was <br />
the President. <br />
<br />
This was both good and bad. Good that he would be more willing to cooperate, bad <br />
that we might have the entire US military on our tails (no pun intended). After all, the <br />
US and Russian militaries had made up the bulk of the SWG's military force. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, good, more visitors,&quot; the man remarked sarcastically, but good-humoredly,&quot;Who <br />
do I have the honor of addressing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Commander Sean Weiss and this is General George Natopt, officers of the <br />
Anthromorphic Allied Resistance military, 42nd Division. And who might you be?&quot; I <br />
asked for conformation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Franklin Roosevelt, President of the United States of America and Commander in <br />
Chief of the US Military.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Franklin Roosevelt?&quot; Gen. Natopt asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not FDR, though I'd like to think I'll be as good as he was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; I interjected. There was business afoot. &quot;Mr. President, some of our troops <br />
found your vehicle crashed on the side of a road. We suspect a roadside bomb, <br />
though we could not determine who's it was. You were the only surviving member. <br />
And. It is miraculous that you have survived.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here, Roosevelt bowed his head as though thinking about the others in the car. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was all secret service in that car. They sacrificed themselves for me every day. <br />
Were their bodies recovered?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I informed him,&quot;Their families are being located and we would like to arrange <br />
for them to be taken by your own men to their loved ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that will be possible,&quot; he stated,&quot;But how long were you planning on keeping <br />
me here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, the real question. <br />
<br />
&quot;No longer than necessary, sir. We could keep you here until your own doctors could <br />
take over, though it looks as though you will has a speedy recovery. However, I would <br />
like to talk to you about something. General, dismissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Gen. Natopt responded, though I knew he would be just outside the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;You see, Mr. President, I am the unofficial leader of the Resistance, seeing as we <br />
have no official government. To that effect, I would like to talk to you as both leader to <br />
leader and man to man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly,&quot; he answered,&quot;Though I must say I'm surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no offense, but I didn't expect a wolf to be so...chivalrous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not animals...well, not in that sense anyway,&quot; I defended myself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; he said as though he already thought that,&quot;And I assume you want to talk of <br />
peace?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir, that was my intention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Commander, you see I've been trying to get my country to end the war for <br />
months now. The thing is, my people just don't want to back down. However, I'm sure <br />
that if we were to agree upon a mutual truce, they would accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then, let's talk peace.&quot;</p>
