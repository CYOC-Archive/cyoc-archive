<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tired of the rhythmic pounding against the wall, Nate knew that if they were younger and less experienced that they wouldn&#39;t nearly be as distracting--heck he could turn the tables on his big brother and become the big brother instead. With that thought in mind, Nate reached for the remote and scanned directly in front of him, hoping the thin walls would allow him to pick up both his brother Dan and his girlfriend Annalise.<br />
<br />
Luckily it did!<br />
<br />
Name: Daniel Jack Phillips<br />
Age: 17<br />
Height: 6&#39;0&quot;<br />
Weight: 179 lbs<br />
Hair: Brown<br />
Eyes: Brown<br />
Build: Athletic<br />
Relationships with nearby subjects: Nathaniel Phillips (brother), Annalise Gordon (girlfriend)<br />
<br />
Name: Annalise Theresa Gordon<br />
Age: 17<br />
Height: 5&#39;10&quot;<br />
Weight: 158 lbs<br />
Hair: Blonde<br />
Eyes: Hazel<br />
Build: Athletic<br />
Relationships with nearby subjects: Nathaniel Phillips (brotherly acquaintance), Daniel Phillips (boyfriend) <br />
<br />
Nate thought it interesting that Annalise saw him somewhat brotherly. He hadn&#39;t really gotten to know her all that well outside of a few times Dan had brought her to family events where she&#39;d tried to awkwardly fit in when Dan wasn&#39;t around.<br />
<br />
Nate simply altered the ages, figuring that subtracting a decade off of them both would not only end the banging, but put all thought of sex completely out of their heads for years. Nate hit enter after entering 7 for both of their ages and sat back.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the other room, Dan and Annalise were coming close to climaxing with Annalise riding Dan. Losing just one year only shrank them both in terms of size a bit, both losing about an inch or two and a bit of muscle, their builds shifting from athletic to lean as they rounded 16 and then 15--at which point Dan released himself into Annalise and she collapsed beside him--them both a bit shorter and thinner and thinking that they had both just lost their virginities. Annalise&#39;s hymen reformed as her breasts pulled up and in and she shrank to a more waifish look, and Dan began to look more like a skinny bean pole whose body hair was fading back into his skin as well as his dick shrinking in size a bit as they went through 14 and started approaching 13 and lost almost a foot in height as they did.<br />
<br />
The exhaustion that had hit them earlier now dissipated as they crossed the line from teenager to curious prepubescents who now sat up and looked at each other naked with simple curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I touch you?&quot; asked Annalise who if she were dressed would need a training bra more than an actual bra. She tentatively reached out her hand to Dan&#39;s shrinking boyhood that at this age would get stiffy without any rhyme or reason--which was why he was unbothered by it getting so as he looked at Annalise who was rather cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, if I can touch yours,&quot; said Dan in a boyish soprano voice as they both shrank by another year and his balls pulled up higher and close to his body, causing his weenie to quit being a stiffy.<br />
<br />
Annalise touched his penis as they both left the double digits and had not only shrank further, but were beginning to reacquire some baby fat they&#39;d lost throughout the years.<br />
<br />
Danny giggled at Annie&#39;s touch, he was quite ticklish in general, but for some reason especially down there where he peed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That tickles!&quot; giggled Danny as he blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if the doctor is to examine her patient, she needs to give a full examination,&quot; said Annie firmly as her mind turned from examining each other with curiosity to plain thinking they were naked to take turns play Doctor. Danny laid down as instructed and Annie began poking and prodding the little boy as he settled at a slightly pudgy seven years old, and using the excuse of playing doctor to find out where he was most ticklish, causing Danny to burst into peels of laughter.<br />
<br />
Nate meanwhile heard the childish laughter coming from his brother&#39;s bedroom and figured it was time to see what life as the big brother would be like for change, and so he got up and crossed the hall to open his brother&#39;s bedroom door without warning to see little Danny and Annie both naked and engaged in a tickle battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem,&quot; said Nate, instantly drawing the attention of the two childish seven year olds. It was hard to think that not even a minute ago, these two had been the two athletic teens pounding on the shared bedroom wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Nate!&quot; exclaimed Annie happily, while Danny recovered from his fit of laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are your clothes?&quot; asked Nate, surprised at the authority that came to his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We... we were playing doctor,&quot; explained Danny now starting to look somewhat confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;And does playing doctor force you to take off all your clothes? Do you do that at the doctor&#39;s office?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... we keep our underwear on at the Doctor&#39;s&quot; said Annie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you don&#39;t need to be naked. Get dressed and then meet me in the living room--I guess I need to keep an eye on you two rugrats,&quot; said Nate with some exhaustion that took him by surprise. Danny looked completely abashed and nodded his head, while Annie simply nodded and Nate left them both to get dressed again. Memories of constantly being stuck looking after his baby brother were flying into his head. His older annoying brother Dan who was like to beat him up as be an actual brother was fading from his mind--not that the memories were completely disappearing, they were just becoming less important than those of his irritating little brother Danny who was like a ball and chain on his social life.</p>
