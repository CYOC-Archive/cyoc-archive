<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brett Green was on cloud 9 and he was sure that later on tonight he was going to be enjoying himself even more. The light brown haired young man had been a nerdy guy in high school - his matching eyes not exactly giving him any points for an interesting look, definitely not exactly the popular sort by any metric of the imagination. But in eleventh grade he got tired of the popular guys picking on him and making virgin jokes, so he went ahead and used the very same school gym they used to get to where they were...and with a great deal more dedication than they showed.<br />
<br />
By the time Brett graduated, he was a far cry from his previous self. A little chemical assistance from steroids he purchased from his former antagonists and now current workout buddy Kyle, Brett had powerfully built trapezius muscles, a chest that women swore seemed built from concrete, abs that seemed etched into his skin, and 20 inch arms. The only hint of his former nerd status was his glasses and still somewhat effete facial features - and even then, Brett had since switched to contact lenses.<br />
<br />
Brett adjusted his jeans as he looked at the time. He was also quite proud of his gluteal development. That was where he, even to this day, injected, so of course his ass and his legs looked somewhat ridiculously overmuscled compared to the rest of him.<br />
<br />
He knew from experience though that Samantha loved his huge legs and strong ass. She said in a trip to the gym that she could watch him squat 355 lbs all day long and never get tired.<br />
<br />
It always thrilled Brett to know there was a woman interested in him who also appreciated his muscles on that kind of level. When he showered after their little gym date, he had to beat off in the shower in fact.<br />
<br />
He and his current date, Samantha, were due to finish eating pretty soon, and then cruise back to Brett&#39;s apartment. He had a pretty nice place, owing to his job working in a tech company - he may have lost his nerdy looks, but he did not in any sense lose the intelligence he had along the way. Samantha seemed like a hot goth girl having grown up - a dark haired pale skinned busty beauty that got Brett&#39;s dick half hard already. Her dress flattered her sublime appearance, and her bangs framed her light blue eyes.<br />
<br />
They had already gone out a few times already, though it seemed Samantha was rather reserved then, and even now, she had been rather oddly nervous about the alcohol the two had imbibed in. She didn&#39;t seem drunk, and Brett didn&#39;t drink enough to inhibit his senses either. He considered this a given at this rate.<br />
<br />
As he paid up on the check, Samantha seemed to take this as an opportunity to press herself against him. She however seemed to realize something even as Brett leaned into it, &quot;Are...are you sure? That this is---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, I&#39;ve wanted you all night long.&quot; Brett responded and kissed her lips, though she seemed rather oddly offput. She seemed conflicted. On the one hand she didn&#39;t kiss him back, but on the other he felt her hand groping at his abs.<br />
<br />
Heading out to his car, the drive home was similarly sexually charged. Brett managed to cool his jets, not wanting to just get up and let his tight jeans show how strong an erection he had been rocking since they left, and it seemed in the passenger seat that Samantha could not keep her eyes away. She visibly wanted to touch him, to hold him, to do things with him, but she seemed to hold off for some reason. He had given her no reason to think he was in any way shape or form reluctant.<br />
<br />
Brett honestly didn&#39;t get it.<br />
<br />
By the time they got to his apartment and rushed to get to the elevator, Brett&#39;s experienced hands were at work. Teasing her under her dress and one hand wrapped around her, bringing her close in the elevator, yet she still refused to kiss him very intensely. He felt how wet her pussy was, incredibly so, but yet she didn&#39;t dare kiss him. How strange...<br />
<br />
And it seemed though like her resistance was wavering. She was opening up to a bit more lip action. She moaned into his mouth, &quot;I&#39;m...sorry...must---must seem so weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just fuck,&quot; Brett said with a confident sneer, &quot;And settle whatever&#39;s going on after.&quot; As the elevator came up on Brett&#39;s room&#39;s floor, he was very close indeed to just nailing her in the elevator. And she seemed almost keen on it despite how shy she was being in other ways. She was wet, and Brett was incredibly hard. He felt almost heady with arousal. His muscles tense, ready to work during sex. He was always an athlete when it came to fucking. Never exactly one to just sit back and make the woman do all the work. All his previous hook ups had championed how resilient and flexible Brett was when it came to the erotic and the thrilling.<br />
<br />
He worked with his door as he worked her breasts, her moans growing louder. By the time he had it open and then shortly after slammed shut behind him, Brett was removing his white shirt and undershirt, revealing his powerfully muscled physique. She gasped as she saw him and started rubbing his manhood through his jeans even as he worked to remove them. Standing there, a powerful bastion of masculinity sticking out of tighty whities and a pair of black shoes, Brett followed by disrobing entirely.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t even care at this point to try and use a couch or a bed.<br />
<br />
Brett started going to town licking her pussy - she seemed to bizarrely try and warn him for some reason, &quot;Please...please wait...if you---if you put it in--!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You cumming is the idea!&quot; Brett murmured and then moved up once he deemed her sufficiently worked up. He always liked to work his lady friends up before the main event - which was his dick. Standing tall at 9 inches, he was not exactly a pornstar, but he was close. He was thankful that his balls didn&#39;t play much role in his powerful profile, considering how small they were normally. Steroids had their side effects.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh please...please...!&quot; She murmured and could not help herself. She followed Brett into disrobing, too turned on to help herself, and spread her legs wide, right there in the front of the door on Brett&#39;s rug. Grinning, the former nerd proceeded forward - slapping his own ass along the way - and started to work himself in there. He knew from experience he could not just shove his dick all in at once. He&#39;d hurt her doing that. So instead he went little by little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh fuck...!&quot; Brett started working, and every thrust it seemed the reservations and issues she had withdrew. Samantha kissed him powerfully on the lips, control lost, and she responded well to every single pump of his hips. Brett had never seen a woman so resplendantly what he wanted. Sure he was a bit too much the lothario to commit to one date, but she was every bit his type. Maybe this could even be a multiple date thing!<br />
<br />
Brett was sure he was seeing her outright glowing she was having such a good time. Her moans and almost screams of pleasure filling the room she was having such a good time. No---No wait. He was sure of it. His eyes opened and closed once, then twice. He swore, as he pumped his cock in, he could see her glowing. Something was going on. Something he had utterly no idea about. &quot;Uhhh...babe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her scream of pleasure that followed blasted his windows to pieces - followed by something slamming into Brett full force. It felt like a bolt of some arcane force. A great and terrible magical missile that came out of nowhere. He could see her eyes glowing as she levitated there, pussy still wet, body arched off the ground. Brett&#39;s consciousness was suddenly fading, even as he felt weirdly good for a man who just got blasted by his girlfriend. Something seemed unusual even as his eyes started getting heavy. His skin tingled, his body was feeling too strangely good...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe...uhh...what&#39;s...&quot; Brett managed, still too turned on and filled by whatever this was to really process what happened.<br />
<br />
That was when Brett blacked out.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
The next morning, Brett awoke to see all his windows returned to normal, suddenly just coming awake - no dreams, no waking stupor, just there and then, suddenly awake and aware. He breathed, something different about the way he sounded. He stretched as he got up, groaning, &quot;What in the everloving fuck happened last night? Where&#39;s Samantha?&quot; His voice definitely sounded different. Not as deep as it usually did. Somewhat softer in multiple ways. Not quite a falsetto or a feminine voice, but damn close.<br />
<br />
He saw he was now in his bedroom, and apparently her shoes were by the bed. So she was probably...<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha? Are you...? Fuck, what happened to me?&quot; Brett passed by a window sufficiently reflective, and paused immediately when he saw what had become of him. Standing there, in his boxers, was not the man Brett had become. But rather some confusing liminal being that in Brett&#39;s estimation comprised both the masculinity he embodied and that alluring femininity of some of the cheerleaders he lusted after in high school.<br />
<br />
His body remained powerfully built and muscular, but in a way more reminiscent of a female bodybuilder than a male one. His breasts were large and generously formed. If Brett hadn&#39;t been freaking the fuck out and saw this kind of a rack on a woman, he&#39;d say she was fine as fuck. His face was significantly more androgynous, his hair longer, silky and voluminous. The color softer, lighter slightly, and wavy. His eyelashes were alluring, his lips slightly thicker. He had no body or facial hair anywhere, except a small amount near his---!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit oh shit oh shit---!&quot; Brett was hyperventilating now. He couldn&#39;t be---! He pulled down his boxers and felt both a sense of relief and dread. His manhood remained it seemed. It was smaller now, at seven inches rather than 9, but that was still enough to make a good impression even if his current body wasn&#39;t exactly---something he could go out on the town in. But then his curious hand prodded down there, and he saw his balls seemed different too. Their small size almost seeming changed a bit. Looking half like balls, half like...like...<br />
<br />
He swooned as he saw his balls part, and if he had to guess, they now did double duty as the labia lips for his new pussy. It looked authentically feminine, placed where it was, despite the presence of his robust manhood. Brett almost fell over from shock, and then heard a voice that both made him feel relief and a growing sense of anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brett? Are you okay in there? I-I know it must be shocking but please, don&#39;t freak out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t freak out!? Don&#39;t freak out!? You turned me into a chick, Saman---&quot; Brett shouted as he pulled his boxers back up, charging toward the voice...but then stopped when he did when he saw Samantha poised over a black pentacle and three burning candles. It was like a scene from a movie in how surreal it was. He looked at the scene playing out there, he looked at the darkly beautiful woman standing in a position of authority over it, and realized he was way in over his head on this one.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what the FUCK is going on...?&quot; Brett asked in a small voice. Suddenly terrified and putting things together. The pentacle, the candles, Samantha must be a witch, he decided. She put a curse on him. Maybe she thought he was too sexually forward, or a total playboy scumbag, or something! So she cursed him for his sexual immorality!<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed and answered, &quot;It&#39;s...really all my fault. You see, I&#39;m...I&#39;m a witch. But my powers are...a bit too strong. Especially on nights like last night, when the leylines were surging. You did absolutely everything right, and you were a stellar lover. Very experienced. But I thought I could control myself and---&quot;<br />
<br />
She just couldn&#39;t. Brett calmed a bit, but also felt a distinct sense of unreality setting in. This was all very different from the rational and fact based action he was used to as a tech company employee. Cupping his face he turned and paced in place, &quot;So all this...is due to some grand celestial phase!? I-I got---I got---!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha tried to calm him down, &quot;I know. It must be all so much to deal with at once. And I&#39;m sorry I was so irresponsible. But I am going to make this right. What hit you was a weird gender transformation spell, one I don&#39;t even know, but which I DO know the answer to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can turn me back!!&quot; Brett beamed, but then cooled his jets when he saw Samantha bite her fingernail and then shake her head;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly right now,&quot; She said with a guilty look, &quot;The spell to revert you back is a complicated one. And I might need to wait for the prana leylines to align again in a sufficiently powerful way. You&#39;re...going to be like this for a while. Though, thankfully, it seems your mind was untouched. Righting mental effects is a lot more difficult than righting physical ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett asked, slowly breathing more intensely, &quot;And how long is this gonna take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be a month, two, even three months.&quot; Samantha said as she seemed to consult the pentacle. &quot;There&#39;s a lot going on right now, and the leylines have been...chaotic lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett rolled his eyes and paced back and forth, &quot;Well isn&#39;t that just something special! I am fucking over the moon!&quot; He slapped his forehead and his pacing became more erratic and panicked, &quot;How am I gonna go to work? How am I gonna see my friends, go through with my social life like---like this!&quot; He motioned at his odd body, eyes quivering. He had never felt so powerless since his high school years, where those stronger than him used him as more or less a punching bag for their own issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Samantha stated as she seemed to consider, &quot;I could grease the wheels. Give you assistance to get three months or so of leave, and then if you want, help you get a new job there or wherever. It&#39;s really the least I can do for all the chaos I&#39;ve put you through already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Are you offering to brainwash my boss? You can---you can do that...?&quot; Brett asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Samantha said with a sigh, &quot;Rather experienced in the dark arts, outside of my control issues. Brainwashing a Mundane is hardly a problem. I just need to physically be near, and extend my prana into his mind, and from there, he&#39;s mine.&quot; She said with a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Okay...&quot; Brett said slowly, and then shook his head, &quot;This is just soooo fucking much. I&#39;m sorry. So witches...witches are real. But how am I gonna deal with---well, all of this!?&quot; He motioned to his generous breasts, powerfully built if more feminine profile, and womanly ass. &quot;How am I gonna handle going out like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could lend you some of my clothes.&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
Brett groused as he considered that, &quot;I-I don&#39;t...I&#39;m not a---not a woman. I may look like one but---&quot; Brett turned and crossed his arms in front of his chest. He did not want to go out in woman clothes. He still felt very strongly, even with all these changes, that he was a man. After all, he still had his manhood and the sense that he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brett, you have breasts now. None of your clothes are really going to fit,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;I know, this is bad. Your gender identity remains as it was before. Very resiliently male. And dressing contrary to that identity is going to feel horrible. But I think it&#39;s something you just...need to consider.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha considered something, &quot;If you want, I could go shopping with you for other clothes. Maybe something more unisex would be more agreeable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett gulped, thinking about his options. He wanted to just...clear his head. And to do that he needed to go to the gym right now. That or go for a run. Meet up with his friends somehow. Even if they would probably not recognize him. He was a very socially involved person - and this change threatened to alter that with the way it impacted his appearance and such. ...How would his ID work!?<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I go out like this?&quot; Brett asked sullenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see your ID.&quot; Samantha said, and when he produced his stack of ID cards for the gym, the apartment, the bank and such, she seemed to wave her hand over it. A thin sheet of black mist seemed to settle over it. &quot;That&#39;s a glamour, a spell for changing appearance and persuasion. For now, your ID will read Britney Kreene to anyone looking. This should shield you from any odd encounters or unfortunate incidents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett breathed, though he was still very much weirded out by all this. &quot;I-I want to---to go out. Hit the gym, go for a run, do something normal. Are you---?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be around here, working on this spell circle and the spell to revert you back. That&#39;ll...be my job full time from here on,&quot; she said with a bitter smile, &quot;Mama didn&#39;t raise a cruel, lackadaisical witch. I&#39;m taking responsibility for this. Now, do you want to take some female clothing or just use your old stuff for now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say...&quot; Brett considered it - though he was somewhat biased for now about dressing up in female coded outfits. He did know however he needed to get out of there and work out some of his frustrations.</p>
