<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew drove down the curving drive at the Beach Club.  As he pulled up at the valet he had second thoughts, <br />
but the valet Raul had noticed Andrew's boner, so he grabbed the towel from the back seat to cover himself. He <br />
left the key with the fob in the ignition.<br />
<br />
&quot;New car, Andrew?&quot; Raul asked, &quot;Nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Raul. Take good care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron was screaming in his mind as Raul ran his the palms of his hands back and forth repeated on the leather <br />
steering wheel. Aaron's camera focused on the Raul's crotch. Maybe anyone at his wheel would get aroused.  <br />
He'd have to check the Chronivac manual later.  He closed the door. Fastened the seat belt.  He then drove <br />
around the building.  Raul raced the engine, and gunned Aaron up to 100 mph before pulling into a parking <br />
place.  Raul pulled his iPhone out of his pocket. He held it up to the computer interface in the car, and <br />
synced with Aaron's brain.  He extracted all the operating codes including the alarm, garage door code, and <br />
ignition override.  Then the app on the phone reset the car's memory, by re-calibrating the computer clock 2 <br />
minutes earlier. Aaron blinked.  Raul jacking off in his front seat. Then he picked up his phone and called <br />
his boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mr. Tran can you clock me out. My shift's over.  I just parked a car, and the beach looks great. Thought <br />
I'd change into my suit, and hit the beach,&quot; Raul said as he unbuttoned his shirt.<br />
<br />
He paused, while listening to Mr. Tran's reply. Aaron adjusted his mics and heard Mr. Tran's reply, &quot;...Okay, <br />
Raul. Behave yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always, boss. Siempre. Hasta la vista,&quot; said Raul.<br />
<br />
Raul stripped down to his black swimsuit.  It was a body hugging Spandex square cut.<br />
<br />
He rolled up his black slacks, stuck his socks into his shoes, and folded up his white shirt and vest.  He was <br />
still sitting inside Aaron and he leaned back in the seat and put his bare feet on Aaron's pedals. He put his <br />
hands behind his head, and stretched.  Then he pretended like he was still driving Aaron. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, Aaron was running a diagnostic.  His memory had skipped.  The time clock showed his memory <br />
linear, but there was no time for the period Raul had driven him.  Aaron could tell from his hot pistons that <br />
Raul had raced the engine, but that was all. One moment, Raul sat in his car seat, and the next moment, Raul <br />
was jacking off in the front seat, and Aaron was parked in the lot.<br />
<br />
Aaron was surprised when Raul stashed his uniform under the backseat of Andrew's car. Then Raul grabbed the <br />
key out of the ignition, and Aaron felt himself entering sleep mode.<br />
<br />
Raul closed the door, and using his iPhone tested the codes he had downloaded. Aaron assumed it was the fob, <br />
as his system entered lockdown mode and set his alarm.<br />
<br />
Raul slipped into the Beach Club personnel locker area, and grabbed a plastic baggy, a couple of foam <br />
insulated drink can holders and a towel.  He nabbed a couple of ice cold beers from the pool bar kitchen as he <br />
headed out to the beach to find Andrew. He popped the tops of the beers sipped from each of them, and then <br />
added the powdered contents of the plastic baggy into the can in the blue foam holder.  He took a sip from the <br />
can in orange foam holder. <br />
<br />
He spotted Andrew in his board shorts lying by the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Andrew, wanna a beer?&quot; Raul said sitting on the empty chaise next to Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Raul?&quot; he blinked, &quot;I'm underage?&quot;  He knew the employees used the club facilities in their off time, <br />
but he wasn't prepared to see Raul's bulging manhood in that skimpy black suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Raul replied with a wink taking a swig from his can and proffering the other can to Andrew.  He sat <br />
down and spread his legs thrusting his bulge forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Andrew said taking the can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Urp!&quot; belched Raul grinning as Andrew sipped his tainted beer. <br />
<br />
Andrew tipped back the beer to try to conceal that he was staring at Raul's tenting swim trunks. He guzzled <br />
the beer as he realized that Raul's waistband was now sticking up an inch above his abs.  He swallowed, and <br />
managed to say, &quot;Thanks for this, Raul, it's good.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bueno, amigo,&quot; Raul replied.<br />
<br />
A little bit later, Andrew slumped into his new car's passenger seat. He didn't recall leaving the pool, but <br />
he figured he was drunk.  He was grateful to Raul for driving him home. <br />
<br />
Groggily Andrew heard Raul's voice, &quot;An-drew, reach in and get the car key out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raul pulled his waistband away from his body, and Andrew reached inside and felt around for his key. He felt <br />
the wiry pubes, foreskin covered cock, and swollen balls. He kept feeling around, and Raul got hard again. <br />
Raul moaned.  Andrew forgot what he was feeling around for, and grinned stupidly as he pushed his nose into <br />
Raul's crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; moaned Raul.<br />
<br />
Aaron was awake, but confused by what was going on.<br />
<br />
He had been awakened when the car was unlocked, and the alarm shut down.  But why was Andrew in the passenger <br />
seat? Whoa, Andrew and Raul?  The scene was hot, but something was wrong. Andrew seemed to be slurring his <br />
words and moving slowly like he was sick or drunk.<br />
<br />
Raul buckled Andrew in, and closed the passenger door. <br />
<br />
Aaron was shocked to taste Raul's cum when the key was rammed into his ignition.</p>
