<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake just made the find of a lifetime and he wasn&#39;t about to let his arrogant, cocky, jerkface of a roommate deprive him of the perks that come with such a discovery. The permanent boner he gave Mike was distracting but Mike was still looking for the box and going to town one handed.<br />
<br />
Drake didn&#39;t care about the box, only winning the lamp and having unlimited wishes, so he aimed his ring, made his wish and hit Mike in the shoulder. He nearly missed as Mike was bending down apparently to grab something when the wish took hold.<br />
<br />
With his body suddenly changing proportions Mike fell on his face in the opposite way he was looking. Drake knew now was the time to act, While mike was down he prepared his next wish and shot Mike again.<br />
<br />
The first wish was to make Mike weigh 1000 lbs. He was more than morbidly obese, standing upright would probably destroy the bones in his legs. The second wish deteriorated the muscle Mike had prior to being obese. Now Mikes body is weak like he stopped all physical activity by age 12 and simply consumed gallons of ice cream each day.<br />
<br />
By the time Drake finished walking over to Mike, Mike was passed out like a baby. The stress he had already endured throughout the day was simply too much for him to stay conscious.<br />
<br />
Drake looked over and saw the box which he grabbed, and immediately his body returned to normal.<br />
<br />
He looked over at Mike snoring loudly and breathing erratically and realized that his jerky roommate could actually die from this experience.<br />
<br />
Moving faster Drake went to Mikes hand to pry the ring off but his fingers were too fat. <br />
<br />
Drake didn&#39;t want to slim Mike down, that was the only thing keeping from doing equally terrible things to Drake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beldazarr! Seeing that we are still here I take it that I don&#39;t win unless he submits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct Mortal.&quot; thundered the Djinn&#39;s voice from every direction.<br />
<br />
Drake pondered as his roommate slumbered. Making him younger would probably just make him more stubborn, making him older would probably give him a heart attack in his current condition. Then he had the perfect idea to take care of everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beldazarr, I have power over his body and mind, right? The ring lets me use your powers at will but just on him, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You understand correctly mortal.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sly grin Drake imagined the party from last weekend, not how it was at 4 pm, but the nauseous, head swimming, not wanting anything but sleep, intoxication of 4 am. The beam reached out from the ring and struck Mike. <br />
<br />
Drake walked over and barely brought Mike to the verge of consciousness.  &quot;You can&#39;t pass out yet! We are in the middle of a game!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Drake, you suck so much, let me sleep or you&#39;re gonna make me hurl.&quot; Mike tried to turn his head and look away but he was still obese, weak, and now drunk thinking it was 4 am at their apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we need you to say you concede if you don&#39;t want to play anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er ner nerl&quot; was all that came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Drake looked around, still stuck in the tournament...<br />
<br />
Mike apparently said something other than &quot;I concede&quot;, Knowing Mike it was probably something along the lines of &quot;Suck my balls&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re a cunt.&quot; You know, eloquent and respectable.<br />
<br />
Drake had lost his patience, He pointed the ring at his roommate and started wishing, beam after beam exploded from the ring, Mike was aglow with green light as Drake shouted wishes which were phrased more like commands towards Mike. Thankfully the ring understood and granted the wishes appropriately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael, I put up with your shit long enough and I&#39;m sick and tired of your disrespect! From now on, you will treat me like your god! (blast) You will have unfailing fear and reverence for me! (blast) You would rather die slowly and painfully than betray my trust or allow me to be displeased! (blast) Now revert back to your normal body (blast), sober up (blast), wake up (blast), and stand up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake&#39;s last command wasn&#39;t for the ring but for Mike himself. Mike obeyed because he was sober and awake. Mike himself didn&#39;t know why he obeyed as he didn&#39;t hear the wishes cast upon him, he is in the habit of being very slow to rise, hitting snooze for 20-30 minutes every morning. One of the many traits that annoy and infuriate Drake. Mike was still a little out of it because of his impromptu nap but he was starting to remember this crazy dream about magic rings and a loud voice referring to him as a mortal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Drake I just had this crazy dream and you were-&quot; he stopped short upon seeing Drake. Mike immediately cowered back, wet himself, and fell to the ground. He crawled backwards unable to raise his head in Drake&#39;s presence but also pooped himself in terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop.&quot; Drake said calmly.<br />
<br />
Mike didn&#39;t move, he could barely breathe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remove your ring and hand it to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike suddenly felt that the ring on his finger was the source for all unhappiness in the world. Getting that ring off his finger so he could present it to Drake was his single and solitary goal. It would surely please Drake, and then Drake would consider him to be good, and free of sin against him. <br />
<br />
Upon presentation of the ring, Drake smiled and said, &quot;I kind of like you this way, it&#39;s sort of fun commanding your respect.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as the praise left Drakes lips a wave of relief washed over Mike and he immediately became erect and ejaculated.<br />
<br />
Drake in his rage wishing never anticipated this effect and was ready to effect more than just his jerky roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, there is one thing I want you to do for me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to say you surrender this game to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I surrender this game to Drake.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a sudden flash of light and Mike was gone, Beldazarr stood in his place clapping. &quot;Your mortal drama amuses me. I look forward to seeing more of your temper, if you wish I could release it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, no thank you. Where is Mike and why aren&#39;t we back with him remembering none of this?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He is waiting for you, about to walk in the door to your dorm room, a moment before the altercation started. We are currently, temporarily, outside your worlds time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a giant grin, &quot;To the winner goes the spoils my young master, when you are ready we will return and the looser will remember nothing but before returning you may make as many wishes upon the looser as you&#39;d like. The ring you used is a direct link to the other person, In this realm you are free to modify them as you wish. Additionally, because you claimed your own ring before making them submit, you may also modify yourself. before returning.&quot;</p>
