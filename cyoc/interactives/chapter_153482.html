<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen spent the next few weeks in a bliss that she had previously assumed was no longer possible for someone in such a wretched position as her. She hadn&#39;t had any more... accidents--thank goodness--and Jen was all too eager to explain her one bedwetting away by suggesting it was some sort of fluke. Maybe it was because she had such regimented bathroom breaks now. Maybe it was because of some curse-related truama. But the important thing was: it hadn&#39;t happened again, meaning that Jen totally had it under control.<br />
<br />
What was even more exciting to Jen was her new relationship with Suzy. Her heart still beat quicker thinking about it: Jen hadn&#39;t even considered that she might not be straight until that fateful morning. Sure, she had some fantasies and flights of fancy, but she had thought those were all just normal weirdness of growing up. After all, she had, and fucked, multiple boyfriends, and enjoyed it! How could someone like her be gay, or bi, or whatever? But still, being with Suzy was the best she ever felt. As they walked through the halls, holding hands, Jen reveled in the stares that they got. &quot;That&#39;s right, assholes&quot; Jen thought. &quot;All eyes are on me, because I have a cute girlfriend, and not because i&#39;m wearing some baby clothes or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, not everything was sunshine and roses. Suzy was clearly uncomfortable changing Jen&#39;s diapers and pull ups and little girl panties multiple times a day. Messing was still an indignity that both of them would probably never grow used to. But it seemed like Suzy was able to look beyond this unfortunate curse, at least while they tried to find some way to remove it. They weren&#39;t having any luck with that, at least not yet. So they struggled through messy diapers, dripping-wet pull ups, slurred speech, loss of motor control, bibs and pacifiers and everything. Even Kyle seemed to stop getting a kick out of it: he was clearly frustrated with how happy Jen and Suzy seemed to be. Then, of course, there was the sex, which Jen had to admit was wonderful. Perhaps it was still the new high of being with a girl instead of a guy, or perhaps Suzy really just knew every inch of her body better than others.<br />
<br />
It was a Friday afternoon, and the last bell rang to let everyone know that high school was done for the day. Kids ran through the halls, shoving bookks into backpacks, slamming lockers and making their way home for the weekend. In what had become a routine, Suzy and Jen had lingered behind, waiting for most of the students to clear out. Since their relationship started, they had primarily filled this time by kissing. They would do it in the gym, sitting on the first bleacher, the cold uncommfortable hard plastic beneath them, their tongues lashing against each other. They pulled away from the kiss, and Jen smiled, looking deeply into Suzy&#39;s eyes. They really WERE pretty, Jen thought. Beautiful brown eyes that she could get lost in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, crinkle-butt, lets get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen blinked a few times. She really HAD gotten lost in Suzy&#39;s eyes. She blushed as she remembered: this was their routine. Jen would &quot;go number two&quot; after school each day, after most of the kids had left. It wasn&#39;t foolproof, but it was convienent. Jen&#39;s stomach gurgled in anticipation: it was used to being in this routine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah! Right&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen and Suzy held hands while they walked into the school&#39;s locker rooms. WIth rows of lockers and bleechers, the stink of slightly rusted metal that hadn&#39;t been updated since at least the 90s combined with the vague mildew of showers that never really properly dried. Suzy checked to make sure they were really alone while Jen opened her own locker and  began to strip, putting her clothes in the locker. <br />
<br />
Suzy gave the thumbs up. All was clear, they were alone. By this point, Jen was commpletely naked. She felt the coldness of the locker room on her belly and nipples, which perked up a bit, probably because she was with Suzy. Even though this was normal for them, being naked in front of Suzy was still something she was getting used to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well, what are you waiting for? Lets get this over with&quot; Suzy said, her arms crossed, tapping her foot. <br />
<br />
Jen blushed even more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Shouldn&#39;t i, like, go to the toilet? That&#39;s what i ususally do?&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy rolled her eyes./<br />
<br />
&quot;what&#39;s the point? It&#39;s all ending up in a diaper anyway. Just go here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy had a point, although Jen couldn&#39;t help but feel embarassed. She usually didn&#39;t actively go  in front of her best friend, much less her girlfriend!<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Jen. It&#39;s nothing I haven&#39;t seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen bent over, getting into a slightly squatting position. She closed her eyes and tried to picture herself over a toilet, with some actual clothes on, like a NORMAL teenager. She pushed. As the shit exited her asshole, she felt a white, crinkly disposable diaper magically appear around it, catching the shit and mashing it against her bottom. She also felt a sudden warmth in her legs as they were immediately covered by kitty-cat-themed stockings, and with a poof she realized she was now wearing a frilly dress, one that barely hid her diaper, much less her cowtail.<br />
<br />
But Jen didn&#39;t feel embarassed. In fact... she felt really different.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ok babe?&quot; Suzy asked. Jen looked up at her and gave an idiotic grin. Suzy couldn&#39;t help but notice there was a surprisingly vacant look in her eyes. Her tail swished back and fourth.<br />
<br />
&quot;hehehe... i did a poopie.&quot; Jen said. <br />
<br />
Suzy was unnerved. That didn&#39;t sound just like Jen&#39;s speech had become childish.<br />
<br />
&quot;UH, are you ok, Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen tumbled backwards onto her butt. She giggled, sticking grabbing her tail with her hand and sucking on it, gnawing and chewing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, ya, i&#39;ms fine! Imma big girwl!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah...&quot; Suzy said, rubbing her arm. Jen loudly and obnoxiously sniffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think i needs a diapee change, mommy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;M-Mommy?!&quot; Suzy stumbled backward. Had Jen--her GIRLFRIEND--just called her... mommy? <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jen was slobbering alll over her tail. She giggled a little bit, and then closed her eyes. Suzy heard a hissing sound and noticed that there was a new yellow spot appearing on Jen&#39;s diaper. She had just peed herself as well. Normally she would just have gone number two, as they had already gotten a pee break earlier. But here was Jen, sucking her thumb, in a shit--filled diaper that she seemingly just peed because she should. <br />
<br />
Jen reached her arms up, making grabby motions at Suzy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want UPSIES, mommy! Upsies!&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy snapped out of it. She had to get Jen changed, and FAST. She couldn&#39;t bear to se eher like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Ok. LEt&#39;s get you changed, alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Upsies!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Yes. Upsies.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy bent down and tried to pick Jen up, but Jen was too heavy--even before she had her little weight gain punishment. She managed to pull a shaky Jen to her feet. But Jen, making no effort to keep herself up, put all her weight on Suzy, and Suzy fell onto her butt, with Jen in her lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy! We fewl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzy didn&#39;t know what to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Ok Jen. Come on. Let&#39;s... you have to act like a big girl so i can change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen seemed to have other plans. She snuggled up against Suzy, rubbing her head against Suzy&#39;s chest. Suzy watched in horror as Jen fumbled with her shirt, lifting it up and revealing Suzy&#39;s perfect breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungee, Mommy!&quot; She said! Jen reached her mouth and latched onto Suzy&#39;s nipple and began to suck.<br />
<br />
Suzy felt revulsion fill through her whole body. She shoved Jen away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, what the FUCK?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy scrambled to her feet, rubbing the drool off her boob and replacing her shirt. She looked down at Jen with disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck do you think you&#39;re DOING?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen looked up at Suzy, seemingly not understanding what she was saying. She was so mentally regressed, she couldn&#39;t even realize that Suzy was freaked out. Jen started to sniffle, then cry, then outright sob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Waaaaahhh! M-m-moooommy! Pwease!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, NO!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I needs a change mommy! PWEASE&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Suzy screamed. Then, realizing what she had just done, Suzy slapped a hand over her mouth.<br />
<br />
Jen felt a tingle all around her body. She looked up at Suzy and frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh, mommy. You&#39;re in trouble...&quot; she said as she changed.</p>
