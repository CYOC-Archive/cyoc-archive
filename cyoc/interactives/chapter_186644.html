<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The peace lasted about an hour before Alicia told him “I’m going to need you to go down to the resort shop and buy me some new magazines” <br />
<br />
“How am I meant to do that?”<br />
<br />
“It’s called walking”<br />
<br />
“I can’t talk in public remember”<br />
<br />
“We went shopping the other day quite successfully without talking”<br />
<br />
“Can’t you go?” <br />
<br />
“No. Because as we discussed earlier it would seem strange having two ultra tall women walking around. I garner attention. People remember me. If I suddenly have a totally different face it would be noticed”<br />
<br />
“People will notice me too. Like you said you garner attention. I have your face. They will wonder why I have shrunk”<br />
<br />
“Not if you’re my mute sister. Let’s right out a note you can pass to anyone who asks you a question to explain why you can’t answer”<br />
<br />
So Alicia dreamed up a note; ‘Hello, My name is Rachel Newcomb, I’m staying with my sister in room 217. I recently had an accident which damaged my vocal chords and can’t talk. Please be tolerant of me’<br />
<br />
Alicia thought that was very clever “Because we explain that it was a recent accident that will explain why you can’t do sign language. And because we say your vocal chords are damaged, that will explain why your neck is rough and you appear to have an Adam’s apple. Now you copy this out neatly in your own handwriting. I’ll go and get a scarf”<br />
<br />
“A scarf?”<br />
<br />
“To wear around your neck. Just like I did the day I had your voice. If the accident is recent you will have bruising, I can create that with make-up. Then of course you would cover the bruising with a scarf” <br />
<br />
After copying out the note on resort stationery, Henry had to sit still once more while Alicia went to work on his neck. She worked carefully, trying to give the impression of a bruise covered by makeup. It was actually a good excuse to cover Henry’s whole neck with makeup. That was the only part of his upper body that didn’t look quite right. She was delighted with the final result. “I’ll just need to blend the neck makeup with your face” She began rubbing make-up onto Henry’s face. It was only when she produced a tube of lipstick that Henry realised she was doing more than ‘blending’.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Helping you get ready to go shopping. Now pucker up and keep still”<br />
<br />
“It’s flavoured”<br />
<br />
“Yep. Bubblegum. The colour matches your nails”<br />
<br />
Once Alicia’s silk scarf was loosely tied around Henry’s neck and he had put on the white sandals that Alicia had bought at the plus sized store. She declared to him “You are now ready to go” <br />
<br />
However she apparently didn’t  mean that. He had to wait further while she made him a shopping list then gave Henry a handbag and showed him how to wear it. At least he now had somewhere to put the notepad and his wallet. Henry was still unsure about stepping out in public though.<br />
<br />
“Come I’ll show you” said Alicia. She took Henry to the bedroom and showed him his reflection in the full-length mirror. “Tell me you wouldn’t try to hit on that girl”<br />
<br />
Seeing the old Alicia reflected in the mirror convinced Henry the disguise was flawless. He couldn’t believe how well the skirt gave the impression that he had a female lower half. Even though he had narrower hips than Alicia, they were still wider than his narrow waist. The skirt accentuated his hips giving him a very feminine figure. <br />
<br />
With no more excuses left Alicia virtually pushed Henry out the door. He found himself in the corridor of the resort. He took a big breath and walked in the direction of reception and the resort shops. He read the note once more ‘Hello, My name is Rachel Newcomb, I’m staying with my sister in room 217. I recently had an accident which damaged my vocal chords and can’t talk. Please be tolerant of me’ and tried to get into character.<br />
<br />
Henry avoided eye contact with 3 different people as he walked that corridor. He couldn’t help but notice a tradesman doing something to a window turned his head as Henry walked by. Henry couldn’t blame him. He looked like Alicia, and Alicia always turned men’s heads.<br />
<br />
It was only a short walk to reception, less than a minute but every second felt like 10. He was very aware of how the long skirt swished around his legs as he walked. Guiltily he walked past reception, no doubt they would be wondering who this girl was. But the call of “Excuse me Miss” never eventuated. He made it to the group of 3 shops that made up the resort shopping centre.<br />
<br />
He walked into the shop that had had some magazines displayed in the window. Then fished into the handbag where Alicia had put the shopping list. He only wanted to do this once. He didn’t want to miss anything on that list.<br />
<br />
The first items were magazines Cosmopolitan and Elle. He began to peruse the racks. He did not see the shop assistant approach him and jumped in surprise when he heard “Can I be of assistance Miss?” from behind his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Henry struggled stifled the sound coming out of his throat. What came out was a sound a strangled cat might make. At least the noise finished at the highest range Henry could muster. The shop assistant a young girl of about Alicia’s age looked baffled. Thinking swiftly Henry found the notepad in the still open handbag and passed it to the girl with the page where he had transcribed Alicia’s words earlier on top.<br />
<br />
The girl read the note. “Oh you poor thing. I’m sorry I startled you” Henry read her name tag ‘Kailani’. She looked to be native Hawaiian and was quite attractive. “Well Rachel Newcomb. I’m here to help. What were you looking for?” Henry had Alicia’s shopping list in his hand already, so he passed the list to Kailani.<br />
<br />
She perused it “I can help you with most of these. But for the accessories we will have to go next door” Kailani quickly had collected the magazines plus a puzzle book. Then Henry found himself following the girl to the back of the store where she collected quite a few items of makeup and grooming items. They then took the objects to the front desk where she scanned them and asked “Shall I put these on your room or do you want to pay for them now? There is no surcharge for putting them on your account but I will have to see your room key”<br />
<br />
Henry fished into the handbag once more and produced the electronic room key. Kailani bagged the items and handed them to Henry. “Okay come next door and Emily will be able to help you with the remainder of your list”<br />
<br />
Henry found himself following Kailani once more. He couldn’t help but admire her rear. She was wearing a skirt with a split in it that revealed lovely legs and heels as she paced. To Henry’s horror he realised Mister Marvellous was reacting. He glanced down and saw a bulge in the front of his skirt. He hurriedly positioned the bag with his purchases in front of his crotch.<br />
<br />
They entered the shop next door. It sold woman’s clothing. Kailani said “Emily meet Rachel. Have you that note you showed me Rachel?” <br />
<br />
Henry did. He handed it across to Emily. She was an older woman, probably in her 50’s. “Rachel has a shopping list. I supplied what I could. You should be able to supply her with the remaining items”<br />
<br />
Emily had read the ‘Hello my name is Rachel‘ note, looked with sympathy at Henry and smiled. “I’m sure I can help” <br />
<br />
“I’ll leave you to it then. Nice to meet you Rachel. I hope you get better soon” Kailani walked off.<br />
<br />
Emily spoke to Henry “I recognise your face. Your sister was in here the other day. A very tall girl. Quite stunning, but then so are you. I directed her to a plus size store. I gather she found what she was after?” She handed Henry’s note back.<br />
<br />
Henry nodded and returned the notepad to Alicia’s handbag. In return he handed Emily the list Alicia had made. Emily perused it. “How about we start with the hat. Down this way” Henry followed her. He now wished he had read Alicia’s list before starting this little excursion. What else was on the list?<br />
<br />
“I think this hat would look lovely on you. The light blue band matches your eyes. It has a wide brim that will stop your face getting burnt and the bow makes it very feminine” Henry nodded. That made sense. Alicia would want a second hat. He had commandeered her own as part of his disguise. It was a pretty feminine hat. It would look good on Alicia.<br />
<br />
“I’ll show you our bag collection. Unfortunately, we are changing suppliers and the new stock is not due until next week. It’s not a big range but anything left is 50% off” Henry followed the woman. Fortunately, her rather largish rear wasn’t affecting him like Kailani’s had.<br />
Emily showed Henry the handbag collection. He pointed at a middle sized white bag with gold trim, similar in size to the one currently on his shoulder. He only wanted to make one of these shopping trips and to just quickly fill Alicia’s list. If she wanted a new handbag he would buy her one. She could always come back and exchange it herself if she wanted.<br />
<br />
“That’s a Chloe. You have nice taste, but I should warn you. Even at 50% off that bag is still $220. The others are cheaper”<br />
Henry pointed at the same bag. $220 was nothing for him. If this bag usually cost twice that it must be well made. It would do.<br />
Emily picked up the handbag. “Okay last item on your list is clip on earrings. Come this way”<br />
<br />
Clip on earrings? Alicia’s ears were pierced. Why would she want clip on earrings? Then it dawned on him. They were for him. A part of his disguise. Best not to argue. He could buy some cheap earrings to please Alicia and get back to the room. He still had 4 days of being ‘Rachel’<br />
<br />
Emily was mildly surprised when Rachel pointed out some pineapple shaped earrings. She had shown good taste with the hat and handbag but these were just cheap touristy junk. But then again maybe she wanted them for a novelty event. She wasn’t going to argue against a sale and the poor girl couldn’t explain her choice. She took the items up to the till and put them onto Rachel’s room account. “Thank-you for shopping with us Rachel. Should you have any other needs I would welcome you or your sister back” Henry smiled back, took the bags Emily proffered and left. <br />
<br />
Back in the foyer Henry realised that neither of the woman had looked at him strangely. To them he had just been another customer. A female customer. He felt a lot more relaxed as he walked back to the room than he had on his way from it. This time he smiled at the girl on reception and the concierge as he walked past. He also made eye contact with a couple in the hallway and gave them Alicia’s gorgeous smile. He even smiled and nodded to the tradesman who appeared to be re-caulking a window. The tradesmen didn’t make eye contact with Henry though, his eyes were focused on Henry’s chest. Henry felt himself blushing.</p>
