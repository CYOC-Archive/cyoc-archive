<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There&#39;s nothing but black all around you. An endless void of swirling mass that would have felt all the more lonesome had it not been for the sense of belonging that came from being near Mira. Even in this barely lucid state, you could still sense her royal presence and how it filled you with elation. You couldn&#39;t feel much right now. Her breasts still making the occasional squeak as latex rubbed against itself, but it was closer than when you had suddenly blacked out. After a few seconds of stirring, you could make out faint colors, shrouded in darkness while Mira&#39;s voice would come from above.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. See, I told you that you&#39;d be something greater. Now you&#39;ll always be by my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your heart raced at the thought. More than it normally should have. Being so close to her had suddenly become the most important thing in the world to you. Your central focus, no! Your very existence was Mira! Being separated was nothing short of torture! Your hearted as as your body felt exhausted, lacking enough energy to turn your head even. That&#39;s when you felt something on your shoulders, surrounding both sides of your head. They felt warm and inviting as you realized where you were near Mira. Her breasts smashed into the back of your form. They felt warm and bouncy on top of your admittedly cold form.<br />
<br />
You tried to respond back to her, to ask her one of ten questions that was racing in your mind. But as your lips parted to speak, your speech had been replaced with groans and blubbers rather than words. The sound was akin to baby talk, the ramblings of a person not in the right state of mind. Mira giggled at your attempts to communicate, waiting until you had finished and tired yourself out before addressing you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry! I had to make a few adjustments, but I think you&#39;ll like what I&#39;ve done.&quot; Mira smiled and would snap her fingers, a piece of latex no larger than a marble separated from her body and inflated in front of the both of you before taking on the form of a purple mirror. Despite the material it was made from, you could still see your reflection inside of the latex mirror as clear as day. Had you the ability to, your jaw would be on the floor at what you had fully awoken to.<br />
<br />
Your body was made out of pure latex now. Any sign of an individual feature was smoothed out entirely. Your head was a round sphere of latex, sitting on top of a mannequin-like body. Even your man parts were smoothed down to resemble a doll now. But more importantly, you were draped over her arms, like some sort of towel. Some more blurbles of shock came from you as Mira held you up to get a better look at yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprise! I&#39;m gunna make you into my new uniform. I&#39;ve gotta look presentable to my goddess, y&#39;know. You just need a few adjustments, but this is gunna be great! Here we go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing a hold of your deflated head, Mira slowly pushed it apart at the top until it split into an open hole. Air rushed into your form as for but a fleeting moment, you had regained the ability to speak. Not that it would have done you much good against what was to follow. Mira stuck her leg into this opening, sliding it up her beautiful body. The feeling was euphoric, the greatest pleasure of sensing the warm body of your owner against your flat, empty form. You felt every inch of her perfect figure become enveloped by your body. Once her feet touched the bottom of your own, the spacious leg was pulled up tight with an incredible force that could have severed any lesser clothing. But having being made from Mira, you somehow knew that you could withstand any force and come out unscathed. Any empty space was squeezed out as the now skintight legging was a perfect fit. Your latex body wrapped around her massive form as you could have cried out from pleasure if your head mouth wasn&#39;t full of Mira.<br />
<br />
This process continued with the other leg, being shoved inside of you and pulled up tight. Having your waist down become Mira&#39;s personal attire was nothing short of a privilege. You squeezed around her ass, prodding around her legs as she laughed at the measure, pulling you against her even harder in a playful jest as she inserted her arms inside of your own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, getting used to it already, huh? Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;re gunna be my best bodysuit!&quot; She said happily, looking down at her inflated chest that was making you strain against containing everything. A finger parted your chest in two, feeling as another opening was created to relieve the tension. Pulling you up tight, she stopped at the point of giving herself a cleavage window that was &quot;generous&quot; in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost done! Every good Chosen has to have a cool cape!&quot; Mira grabbed that part that was your former scalp and pulled, stretching out a moderate sized portion of latex that would become flimsy and mimic the pattern of linen and cloth. A proper cape that rested atop of her new body suit, that being you! They connected by a thin strap that wrapped around her neck and gave her a sort of &quot;superior&quot; appearance. Somewhere in your form, you felt a great power rising up inside of you. A prickling pain was felt in your chest, as the gem Mira had from before would find itself embedded inside of your fabric, just above her breasts.<br />
<br />
Despite what had just transpired, you couldn&#39;t be happier. Every fiber of your new being was reeling in joy, and Mira could tell. &quot;You&#39;re perfect! Oh, and one teensy little thing I may have forgotten to mention.&quot; You felt a sudden wave of intense heat pressing against Mira&#39;s form as you were squeezing it harder and harder before suddenly growing lax. &quot;I may have forgotten to mention that we&#39;re sort of fused permanently. But you totally don&#39;t care, right? I mean, this is way better than being a boring human. And besides, we were always close. Now we&#39;ll be inseparable!&quot;<br />
<br />
You should have been horrified at Mira&#39;s comment, demanding to be transformed back. But being so close to the gem was proving to make thinking rather hard for any thoughts unrelated to serving the Goddess. You may have been a servant to Mira, not even worth acknowledging to her deity, but you could almost hear her commands inside of your mind. They were quickly overwriting any last hope of retaining your sanity as you groped her breasts in agreement.<br />
<br />
You wanted to serve Mira. You were a good uniform. You loved her so dearly, and she did the same to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you agree! Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure my Goddess will accept your apology for not believing her. But let&#39;s go have some fun, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mira said before recalling the latex orb back inside her, and by proxy you, and would begin about testing humanity as her Godess demanded.</p>
