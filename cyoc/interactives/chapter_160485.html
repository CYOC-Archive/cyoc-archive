<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Huh, huh, huh, how?” Michael stuttered out, as he looked around his bedroom.<br />
<br />
The dropped needle and gun were gone. The body was gone. The blood on the floor was gone. Any sign or trace of the fatal act of self defense were completely eliminated from their bedroom. Even eerier still was the window pane. It was placed back onto the window frame, as if it had never been removed in the first place.<br />
<br />
“Wuh, wuh, well at least they fixed our window this time” Michael remarked sarcastically. <br />
<br />
“Jesus” Freddy quietly said to himself. “I thought for sure he was making all this up, but no. It’s as if nothing ever happened here last night.”<br />
<br />
Evan yawned widely, as he saw daylight come into their parent’s bedroom window.<br />
<br />
“Dad, papa” Evan said with a prevalent drowsiness in his voice “I have to get ready to go to school soon.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not going to school today” Michael replied, as he ushered his son away from his bedroom. “I’m calling your school and letting them know you’re not coming in. Try to get an hour or two or rest and then you’ll go to bed early tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Ok dad, I guess.”<br />
<br />
As Michael sent Evan back into his own room, Freddy sat on his bed. He was incredibly exhausted from this long, dangerous night. He had gotten into a big fight with Michael, was almost killed, turned into a dog again, was interrogated by the police and then found out they were covering up this assassination attempt on his life. It was unbelievable to him that this was happening. He knew the mayor was desperate to hold onto power, but he didn’t think he’d go this far. It was freaking him out, even if he wouldn’t admit it and even if wasn’t as worrisome for him as it was for his husband.<br />
<br />
After Michael called Evan in sick from school and tucked him back into bed, he went into his bedroom and sat next to Freddy on their bed.<br />
<br />
“You need to drop out of the race now” Michael said point blank, with a serious expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy replied “you know I can’t do that.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, are you fucking kidding me with this shit? Maybe you’re tired and aren&#39;t able to process what just happened to us over the last six or so hours, but I can and I’ve had enough. Freddy, you almost died last night. Someone tried to kill you and then tried to kill me. You turned into a dog, yet again, after a six month hiatus. We were being goaded by the police into committing perjury and when that didn’t work out for them, they just point blank said they were going to cover up the murder attempt on your life. <br />
<br />
“This has become too dangerous for us to go on any longer. It has long been past the time to drop out of the race. The brick thrown at our window months ago should have been the final straw, but the past is the past. Now is the time to end this campaign of yours, Freddy. For your safety and for the safety and wellbeing of your family, you have to get out.”<br />
<br />
“Michael, don’t you see what’s happening here? The mayor ordered a hit on me because he’s afraid of me and the threat that my candidacy is having on this race. If I drop out now, then I would allow threats of violence and murder to cow me into silence and complacency. We can’t allow our lives to be controlled by fear. We have to rise above it.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, it’s just too dangerous now. This man is an absolute psycho and hell bent on seeing you dead. If the police are just going to cover up any botched assassination attempt, then we’re constantly going to be vulnerable from now until election day. We have to move out of this town, Freddy. It’s just never going to change the way you say it will.”<br />
<br />
“And how does that help us, huh Michael? What’s to stop this from happening in another town, or another city, or another state or even another country? If we just pack up our things and move, after setting roots here for ten years, because of some maniac mayor with a power complex, then we’ll just send a message that this kind of thing is ok and other small town mayors will do the exact same thing to hold onto their own power. A line in the sand has to be drawn somewhere and it ends right here, right now.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, I don’t want you to be a martyr to this cause of yours. I love you and I don’t want to lose you.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t seem to want me around anymore. What difference does it make if I’m killed?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I fucking want you around, Freddy! In fact, I’m upset precisely because you’re not around often enough! Freddy, I admit that you had every legitimate reason to enter this race, but it’s getting too dangerous for us now for you to continue on any longer. You need to drop out and we have to get out of here. If you lose, we’ll never be safe in this town again.”<br />
<br />
“Well, then I just have to make it my mission to win, now don’t I?”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, I—“<br />
<br />
Freddy leaned in and gave Michael a long, passionate smooch. In a moment of intimacy, he gently placed his boyfriend down on the bed and took off his clothes. <br />
<br />
“Let’s fuck” Freddy said, as he stripped off his clothes. “I haven’t fucked you in so long. Angry sex is one of my favorite types of sex.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael replied meekly, as Freddy kissed up his chest and onto his nipples. “I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Michael. Let me get at that sweet ass of yours. I’m so horny right now, I could explode any second.”<br />
<br />
Sighing in resignation, Michael scooched up towards the headboard and waited for Freddy’s penetration. Freddy grabbed some lube from his dresser and slathered it on his dick and Michael’s asshole. After a few minutes of a sensual anal massage, Freddy closed the bottle and gently placed his dick on Michael’s puckering, pink hole.<br />
<br />
“Here it comes” Freddy cooed, as he placed his dick into position. <br />
<br />
Michael groaned, as Freddy’s penis invaded his asshole. He had been fucked by his husband many times before, but he hadn’t gotten it anally in a while. His ass was tighter than usual, something Freddy immediately noticed when he sank his dick balls deep into his husband’s love chute.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, Michael” Freddy hissed, as he closed his eyes and quietly moaned. “Your ass is so tight. I can’t wait to wreck this pretty little thing up.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked up at his lover, as Freddy opened his eyes and began to pound into his husband&#39;s asshole. He didn’t go slow. He needed to fuck and pumped his dick rapidly in and out like a piston. Freddy’s balls audibly smacked the underside of Michael’s ass. Michael quietly moaned, as Freddy grunted while he fucked his husband. Finally, after a few minutes of intense love making, Freddy could feel himself getting close to orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy hissed, as he tightly closed his eyes and felt his face strain. “I’m close. Are you ready to cum?”<br />
<br />
“Just give me a second” Michael moaned in reply, as he grabbed his dick and began to jack off.<br />
<br />
About thirty seconds later, Freddy let out a loud grunt, as he planted his seed into Michael’s waiting asshole. During his orgasm, Michael felt himself reaching the point of no return. Shortly after, he let out a loud whine and shot his spunk all over his chest and stomach. When they finished ejaculating, Freddy collapsed onto Michael, tied to his lover by his husband’s sticky load.<br />
<br />
“Man” Freddy said, as he panted rapidly. “That was so good.”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm” Michael replied, as he moaned in appreciation. “You’re such a good lover, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sensually kissed Michael, before lying his head down on Michael’s shoulder. After taking a few minutes to recover, Freddy slowly got up and pulled his dick out of Michael’s asshole. Michael moaned, as Freddy slid his dick out and wiped it off with a tissue. Freddy’s ample seed came pouring out of Michael’s asshole and onto the bed they shared together.<br />
<br />
“Guess you’ll have to wash the sheets now” Freddy remarked with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Later” Michael replied, as he yawned and closed his eyes. “I’m too sleepy right now. Come lie down with me first.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want to shower first?” Freddy asked, as he sat up on the bed.<br />
<br />
“Later. Come here.”<br />
<br />
Michael motioned to Freddy, who laid down on the bed next to him. They quietly drifted off together for a two hour nap. When they were rested, the two of them woke up at the exact same time.<br />
<br />
“Let me take a shower” Michael said, as he yawned and stretched his arms “and then I’m going to wake Evan up.”<br />
<br />
“Good idea” Freddy replied, as he also yawned and stretched his arms. “Mind if I join you?”<br />
<br />
“Sure. Why not?”<br />
<br />
Freddy and Michael made their way to their bathroom and took a sensual shower together. Freddy enjoyed rubbing his lover all over with soap and slowly playing with Michael’s asshole with his finger.<br />
<br />
“Is this feeling ok?” Freddy asked in a loving tone, as he continued to move his finger in and out of and back and forth in Michael’s asshole.<br />
<br />
“It’s feeling more than ok” Michael replied, as he giggled and felt ticklish. “It feels great, actually. It’s like I need something in there at all times now.”<br />
<br />
Freddy kissed Michael, as he finished soaping up his lover. <br />
<br />
“Maybe you can try wearing a dildo around the house” Freddy suggested. “That way, your ass will be loose at all times.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
“Speaking of sex, this should deduce the fact that being horny does not trigger my transformation into Buddy.”<br />
<br />
Michael paused for a moment, as he pulled Freddy’s finger out of his ass.<br />
<br />
“That’s the other thing, Freddy. We still haven’t solved the mystery of your transformations yet. I’m thinking that the way they are triggered is different than it was last time.”<br />
<br />
“It’s probably that guy Tom reading the inscription on the ring. That’s what caused me to change back at his house that one time.”<br />
<br />
“You’re probably right, but why hasn’t it happened in the prior six months before last night?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe he lost it or gave up looking at it after he couldn’t pawn it. You should consider going over there and seeing if he’s more amenable of giving it to us now.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t Freddy, remember? The restraining order.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smacked his forehead and let out a groan. <br />
<br />
“Duh, of course” Freddy remarked. “When does that thing end?”<br />
<br />
“Fortunately, in just a few days. I’m going to go over there the minute it expires and try to get the ring back.”<br />
<br />
“Good idea. Even if I were to have dropped out of the race, we’d still need to have figured out how to end this curse out anyway.” <br />
<br />
When they were done showering, the two lovers dried each other off and stepped back into their bedroom. Changing into their day clothes, Michael went to wake Evan up, as Freddy got ready to go to the office. Before Freddy left for the day, Michael pulled him aside.<br />
<br />
“We have to talk” Michael said.<br />
<br />
Nervously gulping, Freddy sat back on the bed with Michael in their bedroom. <br />
<br />
“Since you seem insistent on staying in this race” Michael began “you need to tell me everything the commander told you last night.”<br />
<br />
“Well” Freddy replied “he said that the mayor ordered the hit on me and that they were covering it up on his orders. If I reported it to the press, which I still intend to do, then they’d outright deny it ever happened.”<br />
<br />
“Did you record this meeting?”<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t.”<br />
<br />
“Oh great.”<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t, because the commander used some sort of device jammer that shut off my communication device and made it so I couldn’t record him.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not good.”<br />
<br />
“Nope. It’s amazing that he even has something like that at his disposal. Makes it easier for him to keep secrets and cover things like this up.”<br />
<br />
“Well, those two officers took pictures of the crime scene last night, remember?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but the commander was sure to have ordered the photos to be erased. The mayor wanted all traces of this botched attempt to be gone. Those officers are not going to have them anymore. Even on the off handed chance that they still did, they certainly weren’t giving them to us. They wouldn’t testify on our behalf either.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I don’t have any pictures of the crime scene on my communication device and I’m assuming you didn’t take any either, so it’s our word against theirs.”<br />
<br />
“Well, if they try it again, we’ll remember to take pictures of the crime scene next time and—“<br />
<br />
“Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Michael put his finger on Freddy’s mouth and shushed him. <br />
<br />
“Freddy, there absolutely cannot be a next time. Not if we’re to survive as a couple. As a family.”<br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy replied, as he moved Michael’s finger from his lips. “I’m determined to stay in this race to the end. Besides, if the mayor is hell bent on murdering me, he could do it anywhere we went to.”<br />
<br />
“But maybe he’d leave you alone if you dropped out.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not dropping out. I’m not giving him that satisfaction. Besides, dropping out is no guarantee of our safety. My race has gone national, international even. People hate me and my message all over the world. Our safety would be compromised anywhere we moved to. As bad as it here, it could be worse in other places.”<br />
<br />
“Well if you’re hell bent on staying in this race, which you really need to reconsider after what happened last night, then you absolutely need to hire a security guard. We can’t rely upon the police to help us out.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re right about that. That’s the other thing the commander mentioned to me last night. They purposely didn’t file the report on the brick thrown at our house.”<br />
<br />
“I knew it. I fucking knew it.”<br />
<br />
“And he said we’re completely on our own when it comes to our safety. You’re right that we need to do this.”<br />
<br />
“We needed to have done this months ago. After the brick was thrown at our house, that should have been the time to hire security.”<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t afford to hire it then. The earliest would have been after Diya gave me that big donation and I needed to hire advisors and other staffers first. After that, there weren&#39;t too many other troubling incidents, so I thought everything was going to be fine.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, the fact that you went so long without hiring professional security is absolutely dumbfounding to me. Regardless, the time to go without it is over now. We need someone to protect us immediately. Preferably today.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded, as he made his way downstairs to the front door. Before Freddy left the house, Michael whispered into his husband’s ear.<br />
<br />
“I’m serious about this, Freddy” Michael said with a seriousness in his tone “If you’re not going drop out of the race, which you really ought to consider doing at work today, then you have to get somebody to help us fend off these threats from the mayor. While you’re at the office today, make it a priority to look into hiring a security guard. If you’re going to continue in this race, then you need to make sure we’re all safe living here in our own home.”<br />
<br />
“I will” Freddy replied, as he kissed Michael on the lips. “Bye Michael. Tell Evan I’ll see him later and that I love him.”<br />
<br />
As Freddy drove off for the office, Michael felt a sense of nervousness wash over him. The events of the previous night were still fresh in his mind. He was having trouble processing all of what had transpired. It traumatized and haunted him, making him wish that Freddy would have agreed to drop out of the race this morning. If he was to continue on with his campaign, as he was insistent upon doing, then they needed all the help they could get. They wouldn’t be so lucky without protection if someone tried to kill Freddy again.<br />
<br />
After doing a search, Freddy decides to hire…..</p>
