<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sperm were shot out into an absolutely hostile environment. Some unlucky bundles of chromosomes melted in PH of the vagina while others slammed into the walls with no clue where to go. It was quite clear the creator had cum before his partner though she wasn’t far off. A rush of hormones and chemicals suddenly made the environment more habitable for the sperm. Some were knocked back by the wave of juices of sent off course by the contued thrust of the one they had come out of. Some however began to head down a path carved into the female organ. They rushed through small entrances lined with juice and wiggles forward. Some lost energy, some died of old age, and others simply hit the walls and stopped moving. The nice cum was long gone and they were all swimming in hostile juices now. Some hit patches of acidity and melted while others hit stuff that was way too basic and melted. Regardless the number went way down as the speed hit a crossroads. Those that went left were doomed to find nothing while those who went right had a chance. The numbers dwindled, some hit the walls, and others just stopped. The number went down into the hundreds, then the ten, then so low it could be counted but finally the remaining sperm turned and all slammed into something round and white. They began to release an enzyme to eat through the crust of the thing. Some were quicker than others and some stopped moving here. They wiggled and strained but finally one broke the surface and was sucked in. The tail was cut off and the surface changed. The speed could no longer dig into it even though they tried.<br />
<br />
Some lasted for up to two days after that while the zygote began to move down  the Fallopian tube and multiply. Two cells, then four, then six, then eight, and so forth. It formed so many it began to separate with a mass of cells to one side while an open pocket faced the other with a wall of small cells housing the space.<br />
<br />
The newly christened blastocyst moved out and down into the Uterus where it found a spot on the wall and embedded itself in it beginning to cause the area to release hormones and prevent ovulation. The membrane thickened and as days passed the mass of cells began to seperate into what would become the placenta and what would become the embryo.<br />
<br />
Soon days were weeks and the mass of cells began to develop early organs while continuing to grow in size. It elongated and began to show a vaguely human shape. A brain and spinal cord began to develop while the heart and blood vessels began to form. The mother’s blood began to pump into the embryo. These strings of veins and arteries began to multiply throughout the embryo and placenta while the entire thing continued to grow in size. Villa began to spread out into the walls of the Uterus while the nose mouth and ears began to form.<br />
<br />
Little paddle looking limbs began to emerge as the fetus doubled in size with another week passing. It’s tail began to disappear and it began moving as it passed into the eighth week. The lungs began to form while primitive Brian functions formed. The fetus began to move slightly while it grew, strange jerky motions of the strange forming limbs. Minor feelings began to fill it but nothing more. The tail completely vanished by the ninth week and the basic form and shape of a human being came into being. The formation was almost complete as finer details began to emerge and the baby grew in size with stronger and more concise motions prevailed over the formerly primitive ones. Hands began to curl alongside toes and the fetus could feel outside motions. Something was occasionally touching the outside of the thing outside of the embryonic sac. It didn’t know what it was but it was clear whatever was touching it couldn’t feel it quite yet. It’s motions were too small and weak. The first trimester finished and the fetus was the size of a pea.<br />
<br />
The fetus developed slowly continuing to rest, though at one point a bright light shone into the dark space. She didn’t know what bright was but turned away anyway even though her eyes were still fused shut. She rested most of the time and found it easiest when gravity shifted as the mother lay down. Weeks and days passed and she began to form stronger bones and better hearing. She could hear things outside the womb and disliked a lot of it. It was most discomforting when a noise gave a loud shriek and then the uterus was pressed onwards against her like something outside was rubbing it. These didn’t last long though as most of the time she just heart the soft breathing and heartbeat of the space around her. As the second trimester passed she began to sleep regularly and pick up on noises that penetrated the womb. She didn’t understand any of it but the loud and annoying celebratory cheering and clapping really got to her. She disliked the noise and from the sounds of it the heartbeat and breathing was taking part in it too. She also felt warm that day like somehow the thing around her had gotten hotter. Not a pleasant hot either, almost like it had more layers of skin. It ended eventually and a calm buzz of conversation filled the air with voices that were new to her except for the shriek. The shriek matched up with one of them. It was also a day when these noises were accompanied by pokes into her safe space. Her dislike for that was overwhelming and she especially disliked the deeper and more guttural voice that accompanied the softer and feminine ones.<br />
<br />
Soon the space around her began to grow cramped and her body began to fill out with comfortable fat. She made sucking motions, jabbed at the outside whenever it made noise, and found she could hear clearer. That voice that had first startled her with a shriek was present at all times now and she got used to it and it thankfully got softer and quieter. The touches of her uterus however only grew in number. She dislike the feeling as she became more and more human with human emotions, human thoughts, and a human reality. She slept with her wall, kicked and jabbed at touched, and blinked occasionally which revealed a hazy darkness unless one of the days with the light popped up. She began to hate the days when the outside would be slathered with a cold substance and rubbed all over while strange noises and a feminine voice filled her ears. She disliked it and just enjoyed her time in the shrinking space around her. She felt distended outwards like gravity was playing with her differently and wanted to remain forever. However her wishes didn’t come to fruition as after nearly a year of developing the safe around her suddenly snapped and there was a loud angry wailing. Suddenly voices were shouting at her and the space around her got hostile. She was dumbfounded as it was opened up to the cold and tried to push her out of it. She didn’t understand what had happened and her unfilled brain couldn’t reason and got angry. Her head was compressed and pushed out, then her body, then she screamed to be put back as places that shouldn’t be touched like her arms and legs were touched.<br />
<br />
“It’s a girl,” a shrill voice sounded attached to one of those touchy things. Suddenly the voices and the touches were correlated and she hated them. She didn’t even understand what was said. It was garbled screaming to her and she cried loudly as her unbelievable cord was shipped and she had the coating from inside that had broken earlier rubbed off. She released something from her body that shouldn’t have come out and was bundled into an unfamiliar texture. She hated it and floundered before she was handed to another pair of touchy things and squirmed.<br />
<br />
“Mommy’s here,” it spoke while bringing her to a soft squishy thing. She floundered until a beating hit her and calmed her. Her head was brought to the squishy round thing and she latched on and began to suck. It just felt right. The voice, the beating, and the fluid leaking from the round thing. It was all familiar to her. It was thing that had shielded her and it calmed her. She liked the voice and she liked the beating. Her eyes began to droop and she finished nursing before her head tilted to the side and she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to name you Renee, after my Great grandmother, how does that sound little one?” The comfortable voice asked but the newly named Renee was too tired and too young so she just fell asleep in her mother’s arms not understanding a thing.</p>
