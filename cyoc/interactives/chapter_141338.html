<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I first realized I had awareness I was filled with strange emotions. I didn’t know what anything was or why it was happening. Heck I wasn’t sure how to react. Had I always been conscious or did i suddenly just gain it? I couldn’t just dwell on it because sensory overload hit me as sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste registered. I was in a room and knew what that was at the same time. I was also growing, rising in height until I was five foot eleven. Teeth pocketed my mouth, hair sprung from my head, and organs formed in my gut.<br />
<br />
My vision became less blurry by the second and soon my vision was perfect. I gazed around the room and slowly deemed it to be messy. My hair brushed against my back as I began craning my neck back and forth to take in the room. During this time my groin tunneled inwards forming a vagina while my butthole formed opposite. The cheeks swelled beside it and soon after my chest dipped down forming two wobbly breasts.<br />
<br />
I had a lot of knowledge, I knew what things were from a glance but I had no memories. It was strange, weren’t humans, which was what I was, supposed to have those?<br />
<br />
I wanted to ponder forever but my eyes happened to fall on the other occupant of the room. It was some guy with greasy hair, a disturbing number of pimples, and a tent in his pants.<br />
<br />
“IT WORKED!” He exclaimed with pure joy filling his voice. He then lunges forward and had by breasts in his hands within seconds. I yelped in surprise and backed up tripping over a candle and extinguishing it as a went. My foot messed up a ring of chalk that had been scrawled on the ground but the guy was fondling my breasts within seconds. It was kind of freaky but also felt good.<br />
<br />
He planted his lips on mine and quickly twisted me around to lay me on the bed. I backed away while looking around with sorry filling my mind, I had no idea what was happening or why it was happening but this guy seemedoverjoyed.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?!” I demanded and he paused with his pants halfway down.<br />
<br />
“I made you,” he replied very happily, “I wanted a girlfriend so I made you.”<br />
<br />
After that he dropped his pants revealing what I knew to be a penis. I blushed hard and he laughed in response before looming over me with a string of compliments escaping his mouth. I was lain down and swiftly provided my first real memory. A penis breaking into my vagina and proceeding to pound me until it ejaculated. My breasts were fondled and this man felt over every curve of my body admitting to its perfection.<br />
<br />
Once he was done with me I was shushed and returned to the chalk circle. He then recited some words and my form began to regress. My awareness shut off before I could realize what I was. A simpleminded nothingness took over me. I just wasnt aware and likely would have remained do if he hadn’t turned me human again. I had no concept of time so it could have been hours, weeks, or even years between my moments of being human.<br />
<br />
That time was spent being rammed from behind by the man who’d created me. His rod would stir my insides up before ejaculating in me. Sometimes is blow him, other times we’d lay in bed while he played with my breasts. I never saw outside that room filled with crusty takeout containers and dirty laundry. All my memories were of being created and then fucked.<br />
<br />
That was until one day when the guy fell asleep while I was still conscious. I didn’t know what to do so I just lay in bed with him until a tingling filled my crotch. My brain told me that it was the urge to pee so I got up and silently slipped out of the room.<br />
<br />
My summoner’s house was just a mess. Bugs scuttled across the floors and a rancid smell gave me the bathroom coordinates pretty quickly. I entered and nearly vomited for the first time. The toilet was I flushed so I took care of that. I refused to sit on the filthy toilet though so I dug under the sink and found an unopened bottle of toilet bowl cleaner. No scrub brush existed so I ended up using a sponge. I scrubbed that filth away and used the toilet before noticing myself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
I was a complete bombshell, flowing brown hair cascading down my back while gorgeous green eyes sat perched in my skull. I had pale skin with a semblance of a tan with large breasts and a perfectly rounded ass. I looked sweaty but that sweat only added to my appeal. No wonder my summoner wanted to bone me so badly, I was gorgeous!<br />
<br />
I gazed at myself for about fifteen minutes before heading back to bed and laying beside my summoner. I slept for the first time and it was rather pleasant. I felt refreshed in the morning and ready for the day.  My summoner however put me back in the chalk circle just as my stomach began growling. As I shrunk and returned to my original form I promised myself that I wanted to eat next time. Then I lost conciouness and became whatever object I was before again, just waiting to be transformed...</p>
