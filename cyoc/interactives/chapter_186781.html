<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Missy walking on his keyboard was not an uncommon thing, but this time was different. <br />
<br />
The last thing he saw was Missy pressing backspace, he jumped up to try to stop her, but it was two late. He felt himself dissolve into the air. When he came to, he was in utter shock, like getting hit with a flash bang. His ears were ringing. Waves of panic made him not want to open his eyes, not to look at whatever transformation had been done to him. He stayed like that for several minutes. <br />
<br />
Once the ringing died down, he was still too shocked to open his eyes. After an hour still in shock, he was finally able to acknowledge something about his current state. He was lying down, a hard surface rested beneath him. He was naked, that was certain. No fur, no clothes only skin. He was cold. He had eyes. That’s right, he had eyes that he was holding shut. That must mean he’s still a living thing. Now, with some of his fear gone, he opened his eyes to see where he was. Gazing up, he saw what looked like the ceiling of his own living room. Only then did he try sitting up to look at his surroundings. It looked like he was in his own living room, the floor layout was the same, but the furniture was all wrong. <br />
<br />
I must be in Bella’s apartment he thought. Thinking that he might be the luckiest man in the world and was just transported to Bella’s apartment, he decided to examine himself more clearly. Looking at his legs, he was definitely still human, but something felt different. Realizing that Bella’s apartment must have the same layout as his, Tom walked over to the bathroom, he turned on the light, only to reveal the face of Bella staring back at him. He couldn’t believe it, instead of becoming Bella’s cat he was Bella herself. <br />
<br />
He then looked down at his new body. Starting from the top, he saw two small but perky tits loosely hanging on his chest. After giving them a quick squeeze, he continued to the waist. Thin and lined with abs, it had clearly been chiseled into a perfect hourglass. Then were the hips; they were full, wide, tight. A single hand could do no justice to grab his bountiful flesh. Only then did he stand on his toes to look at what was left between his legs. While there was no hymen to be found, what he saw was still what he considered a clean dignified pussy, neatly shaved and groomed for any man Bella may decide to bring home. On either side he saw the soft, supple, meaty thighs that he had so often imagined groping, while they taunted him from behind blinding curtains of leggings and skirts, and under the protective gaze of their owner. Oh, how much he had longed to see them up close. And her legs slowly thinned out making her long and tall, with small feet that narrowed out at the tips where if you didn’t know better you could be fooled into thinking went on forever and ever. Tom stretched out his new hands. Flipping them occasionally looking for any imperfection, any proof that their original owner had been anything less than delicate with how they were cared for. <br />
<br />
Tom looked into the mirror again. Gazed into the face of the neighbor he had lusted for on so many lonely nights. Leaning over the counter, he got as close as he could, not six inches from the glass so close that he could see darting of his own eyes as he looked at his own features. The rounded jawline and hard cheek bones, the tiny button nose, the big bursting eyes that could draw you in the longer you looked at them, all these things came together surrounded by the cascade of curly brown hair that Tom struggled to keep out of his face. The shear beauty of the woman he now was could only make him smile, and that smile led him to giggle, and that giggle led him to wonder why he had been so scared earlier.<br />
<br />
Finally regaining his composure, Tom could break away from the mirror. He knew his original plan had been derailed, but he still didn’t know how much. He noticed a litterbox in the bathroom, then remembered that her cat was also supposed to be changed. Tom looked around for the little kitten until he reached the kitchen and knew the fate of his neighbor’s pet. Sitting in a tray between a bowl of cat food, and a bowl of water was a giant white rubber dildo. He picked it up, wondering if this was Missy’s doing or if the Chronivac just had a sense of humor. He chuckled at the thought of Bella keeping a dildo for a pet. After hearing himself, Tom realized that he could say anything he wanted in Bella’s voice. That thought really turned him on. He looked at the phallic object then his slightly moist pussy. It took all his self-control to resist. But he managed to get his sex toy pet put away in a kitchen drawer. He needed to get back to the Chronivac, then he could have fun.<br />
<br />
Thus, Tom entered Bella’s bedroom and looked for some clothes to wear. Finding a hoodie and a pair of leggings, he left Bella’s home with a rag in the door to keep it from locking. He made his way over to his original apartment. He began to formulate a lie, to tell his roommate who he hoped would answer the door. After five minutes of knocking and waiting, the door was finally opened. Ethan, Tom’s roommate, answered staring slack jawed at the woman he saw in his doorway, he was clearly high as a kite. “Hey,” Tom said in Bella’s chipper voice, “Tom said that he would set up my router earlier, I came to see if he was done.”<br />
<br />
Ethan stepped aside for the imposter to walk in, he mumbled something, but Tom couldn’t tell what. He hurried through the apartment to his own room, only to find Missy lying on his bed, but she was now human again. The Chronivac still had the last transformation opened so Tom took a quick look. It said that he was to be transported to Bella’s apartment and would be transformed into Bella, there was no longer information for the duration. It looked like Missy had also activated the change before which would explain her current state. He quickly closed the program, gathered the Chronivac, and made his was to the door. Ethan was leaning against the wall trying to look cool, he mumbled something again. Something about being pretty. Only then did Tom realize that Ethan was hitting on him, something that he didn’t not appreciate. Tom waved his fingers, “Bye Ethan.” He said in a sultry voice. Then left his former apartment.<br />
<br />
When Tom made it back to Bella’s apartment, he found it was still being held open by the rag he left in the door. He made his way up to Bella’s room and opened her computer. Fortunately, there was no password. He set up the Chronivac and began considering what his next action should be. Only then did he hear the front door to Bella’s apartment open, looking out, he could see in the reflection of a window, the original Bella just getting home from work. Tom needed to act fast. He typed as quick as he could and just before Bella reached the stairs, he slammed the enter key.</p>
