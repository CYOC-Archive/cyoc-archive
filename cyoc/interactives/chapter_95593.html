<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three of you spend the first couple days lounging around the cabin, relaxing.  George soon discovers the weight room and tests out his new muscles.  Each of you try your hand.  You surprise yourself with how much you can lift.  You even manage to out lift George, despite his impressive musculature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Size doesn’t matter,&quot; Colby explains.  &quot;George&#39;s muscles are purely aesthetic.  Yours were earned through manual labor.&quot;<br />
<br />
George rolls his eyes.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you normally a dough boy when you&#39;re not pretending to be my uncle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani, instead of hanging out with you guys, goes by herself out into the wilderness for several hours at a time, often coming back with colorful watercolor painting.  Admittedly, they aren&#39;t very good, but Rani claims they help her to unwind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to school for a Biology degree,&quot; she explains one night after returning from one of her hikes.  &quot;Oh, I was, at least.  But it&#39;s not what I really want to do.  The whole thing is just so stressful, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby merely gives her another genial smile.  &quot;What do you want to do, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiles, embarrassed.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter.  My future&#39;s pretty much planned for you, you know?  I&#39;m pretty much guaranteed money and success as long as I stay on the right path.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby puts a hand on her shoulder.  &quot;What do you mean it doesn&#39;t matter?  Of course it matters.  You can&#39;t just let people piss all over what hopes and dreams like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani&#39;s cheeks flush from the odd combination of Colby&#39;s harsh language and his genial expression.  &quot;Uh, well, I always wanted to be a writer.  I have all these stories I want to tell.  But... my parents would never go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby smiles.  &quot;So you write?  As a hobby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to read some of your work, sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the third day, While Rani is on a hike, Colby and George lead you to the lake, about a mile walk from the cabin.  You&#39;re winded by the time you reach the crest of a hill and look down to see a beautiful emerald lake, set in among the rocks.  Colby leads you down to the only beach, where a dilapidated boat dock sits.<br />
<br />
You set down the cooler full of ice and beer and kick one of the upside down boats sitting on the beach, its paint peeling, its form partially buried by the sand.  &quot;It looks like nobody&#39;s been here in a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby frowns, his expression grim.  &quot;That&#39;s what Rani said.  George, how often would your uncle come here?&quot;<br />
<br />
George shrugs as he pulls off his shirt, revealing his muscular torso.  There&#39;s stubble on his chest and pecs.  Apparently the former own of his current body shaved his body hair.  &quot;I dunno.  It used to be once a year.  He&#39;d invite my dad and me to come down for a week or two.  My dad went most of the time.  I&#39;ve been here a few times.  He hasn&#39;t asked us in a long time, though.  But my dad says that&#39;s not unusual.  The cabin itself looks to be in pretty good shape and there&#39;s still water and electricity.&quot;  George looks at you, and raises a perfect eyebrow.  &quot;Hey.  I thought you wanted to go skinny dipping.&quot;  He then, in one smooth motion, strips off his pants and underwear.<br />
<br />
You instinctively slap a hand to your eyes.<br />
<br />
George laughs.  &quot;Oh, come on.  You said you wanted to go skinny dipping, let’s go skinny dipping!  Strip!&quot;<br />
<br />
You peek through your fingers at Colby, who&#39;s slowly shaking his head in his hand while grinning.  You pull your hand away.  This was the summer of no restraints, after all.  You see George, standing there with an immaculate grin on his face, not wearing a single thread.<br />
<br />
You take a moment to examine him.  &quot;I expected it to be bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
George&#39;s cheeks flush red as he glances down at the topic of interest.  &quot;What?  What are you talking about?  You must need your eyes checked, old man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby shrugs.  &quot;I think he&#39;s right, George.  It looks a little small from my end, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
George sneers and crosses his arms.  &quot;Alright, let&#39;s see you do better.  Come on, I showed you mine, you show me yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hesitate for a moment, before pulling your own clothes off.  Your beefy, hirsute body is a stark contrast to George&#39;s (mostly) shaven, immaculately sculpted, muscle bod.  You stand there in the nude, feeling a little self-conscious.<br />
<br />
George glares at your crotch before turning away.  &quot;Alright, fine.  You win.&quot;  He then grins and suddenly sprints off the end of the dock. &quot;Cannonball!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of you spend hours swimming in the lake and drinking beers.  You and Colby even gather some wood and light a fire on the beach, after getting dressed, of course.  You spend some time watching the sky and sharing stories, both your own and borrowed from your respective bodies.  George shares that his body was from an amateur bodybuilder who could never quite make it.  He guessed all the muscle building was to compensate for his rather small manhood.  He also gets you to drink way too many beers, getting you pretty buzzed.  At least you earn twenty bucks out of it.<br />
<br />
The days go by and you notice your stubble getting pretty long, threatening to become a beard.  You decide to let it go.  You&#39;ve never seen your dad with a beard and you wonder what that would be like.  George also develops some stubble, but it&#39;s not all that thick or fast growing.  The stubble only seems to add to his immaculate appearance, making him look like an Abercrombie & Finch model.<br />
<br />
George&#39;s habit of testing your stomach capacity also continues.  Most meals he&#39;ll only finish about half and bet you to eat the rest of it.  It&#39;s an easy ten or twenty bucks each time, so you go for it.  Heck, by the end of the week you&#39;ve made about 200 bucks off of him.<br />
<br />
Eventually you can&#39;t help but ask him. &quot;George!  Where is all this money coming from?&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughs.  &quot;It&#39;s actually Colby&#39;s.  He gives me money when I run to town on a food or beer run, and that&#39;s the leftover.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the end of the week you start noticing a change in your body, and it&#39;s not related to the socks.  You&#39;ve noticed your pants are feeling tight, and the bloat you get from overeating every night hasn&#39;t quite gone all the way away, leaving you stomach rounder than usual.  It&#39;s subtle enough that you&#39;re the only one to notice, but you can&#39;t help but wonder if you&#39;ve put on some weight.  You&#39;re briefly concerned about watching your diet, and then you remember the socks.  You were going to change back into your normal body before going home, anyway.  Any extra weight or other things done to your body on your no restriction summer would be undone when you turned back into yourself.  The thought puts you at ease and you decide not to worry about you slightly tighter pants.<br />
<br />
Later that same day, George calls you and Colby over.  &quot;Guys.  I said on the way up here that I wanted to try out all the shoes I brought, and I meant it.  As much as I like being muscle guy, I want to try something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug at him.  &quot;So?  What&#39;s stopping you?&quot;<br />
<br />
George grimaces and gestures upstairs.  &quot;Her.  Rani!  I don&#39;t know how we can justify one of us constantly leaving to be replaced by somebody else to her.  In fact, the way I see it, we&#39;ve got two options.  Either we get rid of her, or we tell her what&#39;s going on.  And, I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I don&#39;t like the idea of letting her in on the socks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby&#39;s brow furrows.  &quot;Hmm.  I don&#39;t really want to send her on her way.  She needs this vacation just as much as we do, if not more.  I say we should tell her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them turn to you.  George raises his perfect eyebrows as Colby scratches at his graying beard.  &quot;It&#39;s up to you, bud.  You&#39;ve got the deciding vote.&quot;</p>
