<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now let us take a step back and <br />
see how the other girls found their<br />
lives changing as well.<br />
<br />
 Lindsey was having trouble sleeping since she learned <br />
she might start changing, and Kelly knew it. <br />
<br />
 Her little Munchkin was having <br />
nightmares every night, and was it any wonder.<br />
 <br />
 So the night Lindsey asked if she could sleep with Kelly, <br />
how could she refuse. Lindsey was having the same dream, in witch <br />
she was naked and covered in hair and people ware throwing things at her.<br />
<br />
 Cuddled up next to Kelly, Lindsey relaxed; <br />
she felt her warmth, heard her heartbeat, and Lindsey smelled Kelly’s milk. <br />
‘Well at lest if I change’ Lindsey thought ‘I can drink Kelly’s <br />
special milk again.’ And fell asleep.<br />
<br />
 Kelly felt a tingling in her breast, and when <br />
she was shore her sister was asleep, she carefully <br />
got up and went to the bathroom with her pump in it. <br />
Draining her breasts was becoming a more pressing need <br />
then going pee, and recently she found, that if she didn’t milk <br />
them before bed, she’d wake with them painfully <br />
swollen and her bed sheets dripping wet. <br />
<br />
 The young girl removed her night gown and bra, and as Kelly started <br />
to pump the milk from her first breast a strange day dream <br />
crawled out of the back of her mind. In her imagination the pump was <br />
a baby nursing her dry. She only started doing this the other day, and found it turned the chore that reminded her of the freak she was becoming into a something that <br />
made her feel good. When she was done with her first breast she stopped <br />
for a second, gave herself a hug and felt the warm glow of the thought <br />
of nursing a baby, and began again on the second one, rocking her self <br />
and humming a soft lullaby.<br />
<br />
 After she was all done, Kelly empted the milk from the container <br />
attached to the pump seeing how full it was, decided to find a bigger <br />
one the next day. She was so tired at this point she forgot to <br />
put back on her clothes, and instead dragged herself back to her <br />
bed in just her panties.<br />
<br />
 Lindsey twitched in her sleep; she was having the nightmare again. <br />
Kelly dozed off the minute she got under  the cover, her daydream from <br />
earlier came back to her in her sleep. Lindsey settled the moment she smelled <br />
the strong fresh sent of milk.<br />
<br />
 Her nightmare shifted in to the same dream as Kelly’s, <br />
but from the baby’s perspective. And as they awoke, they <br />
found there dream had come to pass. <br />
<br />
                                                   *****<br />
<br />
Mary and Ariana met a guy one year older than them named Nathan. <br />
<br />
This charming young man, known by his friends for his “social life”, <br />
thought he could use there predicament to get them both in bed with <br />
him at the same time; it being one of his fantasies.<br />
<br />
The two girls seemed to almost throw themselves at him, <br />
they were so glad a cute guy was showing interest in them again <br />
and the hormones were making them really horny, but they turned down a <br />
lot guy with similar intention in the past. He’d play it slow, for now. <br />
<br />
                                                   *****<br />
<br />
Beth was moved from her house to the hospital. <br />
<br />
Her changes had sped-up again, she was already further <br />
changed then the others and showed no hint of stopping. <br />
The doctors are worried, not just for Beth but the others too.<br />
<br />
The young girl, when she hit “Phase Two” as they are now <br />
calling it, developed several changes no one could <br />
predict, starting with fur.<br />
<br />
“Something most have bin mixed with the hormones” <br />
the Doctor said to her parents. <br />
“We think something is altering her in ways we <br />
can’t explain, like the things around her lower jaw <br />
and fore head, or that pouch thing that is forming <br />
over her breast.”<br />
<br />
“Or how her eyes changed?” <br />
Her mother said thro tears. <br />
“Exactly.” the Doctor replied. <br />
“We no longer know what these girls will be <br />
at the end of this, but it won’t be anything <br />
this world has see before”<br />
<br />
                                      *******<br />
<br />
Sarah was at the dentist. Her changes had protest, <br />
her main had grown so she couldn’t see <br />
skin on any part of her neck and even clamed the under <br />
side of her chin, and although it wasn’t a beard,<br />
 it defiantly was not attractive.<br />
<br />
The amount of milk she produced <br />
kept increasing but the hair on her breasts <br />
recently made her pump useless so she’s started milking <br />
herself by hand, she panicked when the pump stopped working <br />
and needed her mother to help her the first time. <br />
<br />
And on top of all this her teeth started hurting <br />
yesterday. So here she is, sitting in the dentist chair, <br />
desperately needing to milk herself, waiting for the <br />
dentist to come back with the X-rays.<br />
<br />
“I have a little bad news.” the dentist said. <br />
“The reason your teeth have bin hurting is that a <br />
new set of teeth are growing behind them, <br />
forcing them out like they did to <br />
your baby teeth”<br />
<br />
                                ******<br />
<br />
Lydia was running home from an appointment, <br />
she was running faster then she ever had. <br />
The growth in her legs and hips slowed down <br />
after evening out. <br />
<br />
This left her lower half looking <br />
like it belonged to a much, much bigger and <br />
muscular person, but gave her the ability to run faster <br />
and jump higher then anyone she’d ever met, <br />
and she was still getting stronger.<br />
<br />
She was going to set up a meeting with <br />
the other girls as soon as she got home. At her <br />
appointment she learned the reason she had almost no <br />
fat on her body anymore was that the changes where burning <br />
it off and if she and the other girls, especially the <br />
ones producing allot of milk, didn’t start eating <br />
more and the right type of food, these changes <br />
where going to burn them out.<br />
 <br />
                                     *******<br />
<br />
Tonia’s changes were happing <br />
exactly like Jenifer’s and Lisa’s <br />
did earlier in the week, except one <br />
thing, something was happing to her <br />
vagina, she started playing with <br />
it when she was alone, but <br />
something about it felt different, <br />
<br />
  wrong.<br />
<br />
                                       ******<br />
<br />
Connie was with Jim, <br />
since she got pregnant the <br />
overpowering need for sex left <br />
her, and, so it seemed <br />
went to Jim.<br />
<br />
The Doctors told Jim he was <br />
hormone positive earlier that day, <br />
and right now he needed Connie. <br />
His personal sex goddess, who’s grown plus fifty present <br />
her former height, so strong she could carry him like a baby, <br />
and breasts filled with sweet milk he <br />
dreamed of drinking.<br />
<br />
Connie was also enjoying his changes, <br />
witch she was currently holding in her <br />
hand and mouth wile he moaned for her. They spent <br />
the night experiencing each others changes and love, <br />
this time for Jim instead of Connie.</p>
