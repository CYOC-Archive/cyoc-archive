<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel sat there in her slumped down position, arms slightly bent at the elbows, legs stuck out before her. The shower was still on, raining water down upon her, where it beaded up on her artificial silicone skin. She couldn&#39;t move a muscle. She couldn&#39;t blink, much less move her eyes. All she could do was look straight ahead. The bathroom was quiet save for the soft pattering of the water. <br />
<br />
But if Rachel had been capable of speech, the profane professionals of pleasure that would emanate from her would be enough to make a brothel in Las Vegas blush with indecency. <br />
<br />
Again and again, the orgasmic surges rocked through her body. Each orgasm - and somehow, her silicone body was still capable of it - was so intense that were she still a living organic being, she surely would&#39;ve passed out by this point. It never seemed to end. Each time an orgasm built up within her and crashed through her artificial body, a new one would begin. <br />
<br />
And yet, all Rachel could do was lie there.<br />
<br />
Part of her wondered - who the fuck had sent that perfume or whatever it was to her. For she was absolutely certain that it had been that concoction that had resulted in this. This transformation into a sex doll. For all she knew, this was going to be her existence from now on. She was having to grapple with a lot of new preconceptions. Apparently magic was real - what else could explain such a transformation? How else could her mind still be conscious despite residing in a body that probably didn&#39;t even have a brain? It&#39;s not like she was a scientist or anything even close to that - but she was still fairly certain that science was not capable of doing anything remotely like this. What kind of person would even want to do this?? And WHY did they do it to her?? <br />
<br />
The other part of her was mentally screaming. FUUUUUUCK ME! THIS FEELS SO GOOD! SOMEONE FREE ME! SOMEONE USE ME! WAIT, NO, DON&#39;T USE ME, I&#39;M NOT A DOLL. I AM, BUT...I DON&#39;T WANT TO BE! FUUUUUUCK! WHEN WILL THE PLEASURE END...GOD I JUST WANT SOMEONE TO TOUCH ME....<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure how long she was in there like that. There wasn&#39;t really a good way to keep track of time, and she&#39;d had so many orgasms at this point that it could&#39;ve been days and she might not have even noticed. The pleasure was just that fucking intense. <br />
<br />
But eventually there was a knock at the door. Had she still had a functional heart, it would&#39;ve burst with a mix of hope and fear and adrenaline. Had she been able to move, she would&#39;ve sprung up to her feet. But instead, she simply was forced to lie there in silence, staring straight ahead, the same pouty expression on her face, her silicone boobs dominating the lower field of her vision. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel? You in there?&quot; a voice questioned.<br />
<br />
She knew that voice. It was Brooke! One of her friends from high school, one of the ones who was going to be going to community college with her in the fall. Though, she realized with a sinking sensation that unless she was freed from this state, college wasn&#39;t going to be on the table for her. Rachel had to admit that Brooke was pretty sexy - her sexually charged mind conjured up the image of her friend - strawberry blonde hair, perky tits, intense brown eyes...god, what would it feel like to have those hands rub her up and down...<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom let me in,&quot; Brooke continued. &quot;I&#39;m coming in, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel wondered how Brooke would react. Would she be disbelieving, expecting some kind of prank? Would she be afraid, and run away? Would she call for help and draw the attention of her parents? She wasn&#39;t even sure what she wanted to happen. <br />
<br />
The door cracked open, and Brooke entered. She closed the door behind her...and locked it.<br />
<br />
Rachel simply sat there, staring straight ahead through glassy eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Brooke whispered. She walked closer, her footsteps echoing in the bathroom. She opened the door to the bathroom. Rachel could only see Brooke&#39;s shapely tan legs from her perspective, but a moment later, Brooke knelt down, eyes wide, looking at Rachel&#39;s silicone body. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; Brooke said again. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it. I can&#39;t believe it worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
It WORKED?? What the FUCK?<br />
<br />
BROOKE had done this to her?!<br />
<br />
WHY?!<br />
<br />
She wanted to scream at her friend, she wanted to kick the living shit out of her - and yet, she also just wanted Brooke to fuck her brains out and provide some relief from the endless orgasms. Rachel whimpered internally, feelings of betrayal intermingling with the intense feelings of lust overwhelming her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if what the witch said was true...you should still be in there...&quot; Brooke whispered in awe. &quot;Man...I can&#39;t believe it...I...I guess I owe you an explanation...&quot;<br />
<br />
No SHIT, Rachel thought. And then she thought, who gives a shit, just FUCK me already!!<br />
<br />
Brooke let out a small laugh. &quot;God, Rachel, I&#39;ve had such a crush on you...for so many years...but you never showed any interest in me. I dropped hints, I suggested I was bi, but...nothing. I tried to move on but...damn. You&#39;re my dream girl. I couldn&#39;t move past it. And then...one of my sisters friends came to me, and she told me...she knew a witch. I didn&#39;t believe it at first, but then she demonstrated it to me...and she gave me this perfume and said it would make you into mine, and mine alone. I guess...I didn&#39;t quite expect this, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Licking her lips, Brooke reached out and grasped one of Rachel&#39;s silicone tits and gave it a squeeze.<br />
<br />
A burst of white hot pleasure burst through Rachel&#39;s body. She would&#39;ve been a shuddering, quivering pile of girl on the floor if she&#39;d been able to move, but she was forced to simply lie there in silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to have so much fun with you,&quot; Brooke continued. &quot;Not sure how I&#39;m gonna get you out of here...but first...&quot;<br />
<br />
With a mischievous smile, Brooke stood up and Rachel was forced to watch as Brooke began to strip off her clothes, kicking them to the side. Eventually, Brooke was naked and she stepped into the shower, closing the door behind her. She reached down and grabbed Rachel&#39;s shoulders, hoisting her body up with a grunt until her silicone body was leaning up against the wall, staring impassively ahead. Brooke looked down with desire, and then leaned forward and kissed her rubbery lips, moaning softly in pleasure - sending a new series of incredible orgasmic explosions rocketing through her artificial form.</p>
