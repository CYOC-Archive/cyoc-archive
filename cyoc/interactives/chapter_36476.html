<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pressure on my bladder made me realize something; I had no idea how to pee like a girl. I knew that it involved sitting down, but beyond that, it was a total mystery.<br />
<br />
Pondering over how my new plumbing worked, I voiced the next wish. &quot;I wish that all of my old clothes and all of Laura's clothes would vanish.&quot; Suddenly Laura's jogging suit and the clothes that had come off me disappeared.<br />
<br />
But there was still the problem of peeing. Plus, I felt like a total pervert for wanting to go into the ladies room to urinate; something that was rapidly being drowned out by a feeling like it was normal to do that. Blushing some more, I asked Laura if she could explain to me how a girl does her business.<br />
<br />
Her laughter made me blush harder and than she said, &quot;Why don't you just use the ring to wish that you had that knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at her straight faced, cheeks burning redder, I replied with, &quot;Because for some reason it feels wrong to accomplish through a wish what every normal girl learns naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not having a reply, she takes me by the hand and leads me to a restroom. Inside, we luckily run into no one and after undoing my bib-overall shorts, I hear Laura begin to explain what I should be doing.<br />
<br />
Peeing sitting down for me was a truly odd experience and after I finished my business, I stood and exited the stall. Washing my hands, Laura once again asks me, &quot;So what shall we do? Should we make another wish? Or should we just hang out until the three hour time limit is up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adjusting my shorts, I look at my reflection in the mirror, fiddle with my hair, look at Laura and shrug. A pause follows and I say finally, &quot;Why don't we forget about wishes for right now. You can show me what it's like to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, she leads the way outside the bathroom. Suggesting the mall, we start heading for it. Halfway there, we pass some real cute boys from the Junior High and before I can stop myself, I lean over to Laura once their out of earshot and whisper, &quot;The one in the middle is real cute, don't you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
A hot feeling washes over me and for some reason, I know that this has nothing to do with blushing. Laura looks at me and than giggles.<br />
<br />
For the next two hours, we bum around the mall; window shopping and talking about real cute boys. As we sit in the food court drinking our drinks, I comment out loud to Laura, &quot;I'm thinking of staying this way. For some reason I feel real comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura looks like she is about to say something and then changes her mind. When I ask what's on her mind all she tells me is, &quot;If you stay like that, you'll find out eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giving her a strange look, I absently rub my finger over the ring. Finally, making up my mind, I ask Laura, &quot;Do you want to go back to your previous age or would you like to regrow up? Because, to tell you the truth, I'm going to grow up again, but this time as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura looks thoughtful for a minute and than finally nods her head and says, &quot;I'd like to remain thirteen and grow up all over again. Besides, you'll need someone to help with your womanly ways, if your going to be a repeat of before.&quot; At this point, she begins to laugh again.<br />
<br />
Grinning, I call her a tease and then make the wish. &quot;I wish that Laura and I could stay as thirteen year old girls and grow up together. Everybody has known Laura and I as such.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I felt a cramping in my abdomen. Standing, I excuse myself to the bathroom. Inside, the sensation has grown and as I'm undoing my over-alls, I feel a dampness between my legs. Fearing I might have peed myself, I drop my shorts and sit down on the toilet. Looking down, I see a red dot in underwear.<br />
<br />
Shame washes over me and I wonder what to do. As I sit there and think, a noise by the bathroom door alerts me to the presence of another woman. A minute later, a strange noise can be heard and then a box slides under the stall.<br />
<br />
Wondering what to do, I hear Laura's voice tell me, &quot;I wanted to warn you, but I figured this was something you had to learn on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening?&quot; I ask.<br />
<br />
Laura then calmly talks me through the use of pads and tampons. She explains how this is normal and when it usually happens for a girl. Feeling ashamed, I place the pad in the center of my underwear, pull up my shorts and panties and step out of the stall.<br />
<br />
Grimacing, I ask her, &quot;Is there anything I can do about the discomfort? Both in wearing this pad and the feeling in my abdomen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking patiently at me, she than continues to explain a few more things; mostly about something called Midol. After this talk, I look at her and ask, &quot;Would it be considered cheating if I wished myself to be a five year old girl instead of a thirteen?&quot;<br />
<br />
This brought another grin to her face and she said, &quot;No. Actually that might be a better idea. At least you'll learn a few things about girls at a normal pace, rather than having them to all be crammed in a short while. Just do me a favour. If you make that wish, make it so that we both are the same age. I don't want to be thirteen and find that my best friend has just made herself five.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, feeling cramped, I told it was a deal, but I was going to wait for my period to complete it's cycle.<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
In truth, I waited for more than just the end of my cycle. I had a few more things to try. I wore a bikini for the first time and enjoyed it. At my request, Laura and I had sex together and than a couple of days later, I tried it with a boy. Finding out I now liked boys was a shock and after two more weeks as a teenage girl, I was ready to make my next wish.<br />
<br />
My old life pretty much forgotten, I stood naked in my room and looking at Laura, also naked, asked if she was ready. Seeing her nod,I said out loud, &quot;I wish that Laura and I were both five year old girls and that everyone knew us as such.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly I was overcome with a sense of vertigo as I shrunk down to a height that was somewhere between three foot five and four feet tall. Instead of watching Laura, I looked down and watched as my chest flattened out and a lot of my baby fat grew back in place.<br />
<br />
Looking up, I watched as my room transformed into a little girls room. The posters on the wall vanished and the walls turned white with a pink trim along the top. My dresser changed into a white dresser with pink knobs. My bed sheets and comforter changed into a full Hello Kitty sheet set and then the bed made itself. A night-lite appeared in the wall and a My Little Pony lamp appeared on the nightstand.<br />
<br />
Next, my room began to fill with the toys normally given to a five year old. A doll house appeared in the corner and next to that a real tall mirror appeared. A plastic table complete with a plastic tea set appeared in the middle of the room. I could hear a thumping noise from the closet and when I opened it, I found it full of dress and costumes. Along one wall was a toy box full of dolls and stuffed animals.<br />
<br />
Turning around, I saw Laura, who was now dressed in a pair of jeans that had no buttons or zippers on the front. She was also wearing a shirt that had a picture of Mew on the front. Looking down at myself, I saw that I was now wearing a pair of one piece cotton bib-overalls that were purple and had eight pink buttons sewn onto it. Under that I was wearing a white shirt that said 'Princess' in big letters and under that was a picture of Hello Kitty in a gown. Looking at Laura, the ring forgotten for the moment, I asked her in a child's voice, &quot;What were we going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura replied......</p>
