<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I gotta admit, I was curious. <br />
<br />
When the quiet guy turned into a cute goth girl, my first inkling was to stand around where he stood and see what happened. Not that I had a masculinity death wish. But I figured it couldn’t really hurt.<br />
<br />
There were so many girls, going back to fourth grade, I had a crush on. Each and every time, it didn’t work out because of something that I did, some way that I looked, or some random disagreement.<br />
<br />
Ty and I both came from the same small town in the hills. No matter what we did, the girls either ignored us or they put us through the wringer. It was at the tail end of high school, just 100 others in the class, mostly girls. And even the nicest ones had this constructed sense of polite reactions. Like just being around them offered up the kind of obligation that we were in a restaurant and we were the waiters. In the good times, they were the waitresses. <br />
<br />
That distance meant just trying to hit on them or suggest a fun weekend or work your way to a dance was beyond the pale. How could you be so uncouth! Meanwhile, Mister Owner just walks in and whatever he says goes. Around our school that was JT Turner, the dude born on third base and he can just walk his way home and back whenever he likes. Love and romance was a rigged game.<br />
<br />
So, one night we just went off about all this to one another, laughing so we don’t cry about it, and Ty says to me, “Bro, you know if anything like really weird or supernatural ever happens to me and like I turn into a blonde chick with a huge rack. Well, first of all, I’m bouncing those in front of the closest mirror and just living it up, man. But I promise, as a man, on my honor, I will go out with you with no strings attached. Even more, we can take all that for a… Test drive? What I’m saying is if I get turned into a chick then let’s just forget everyone else and just, you know, hook up. Not to make this sound gay or anything. Not that there’s anything wrong with that either. But I know you like chicks and so do I but if I was a chick, I would absolutely hit that… and by that, I mean you. I would let you fuck me in my pussy so hard… well, you know.”<br />
<br />
Remarkably, neither of us were stoned when we had this conversation. Sleep deprived, delirious, coasting on video games and the grossest snacks, but not stoned. Whether each of those states is all that different, I don’t know, but that’s where we were.<br />
<br />
So, of course, my man lays down that sharing of his commitment to brotherhood or whatever and there’s no way I’m not answering in kind. “Same here. I love to see you with a big rack. But, yeah, man. Same to you. If something like Mr. Bigfoot out in the woods up north is real and like those replica aliens and all that, I’m sure this kind of stuff is the junior leagues. It can happen. But what I’m saying is, if it happens to me then I’ll do you the same. Literally. I will wet your whistle something fierce. More than that. Let’s date and go steady. I mean we get along so well, the two of us as a chick and a dude and like even two chicks, because that’s cool too… that’s not screw around…well you know what I mean, not beat around the bush you know. Let’s agree, if in the unlikely event something like that happens, on my honor I totally and completely will be your girlfriend or unrestrained fuck buddy girl. What happens after that, I don’t know, but let’s just bust each other’s cherries.”<br />
<br />
We didn’t do any crazy blood or ritual stuff but we shook hands on it, give a nod, and agreed this is the way things were. We both totally forgot about it and at the same time there was an understanding that when the activation code came for something like that, then we weren’t going to try to take an out.<br />
<br />
But after that impossible possibility had happened right in front of us, I must admit that evening was right there in my head. I thought about saying something, but I didn’t have the chance before some light from over by the window caught my eye. Everything happened so fast after that.<br />
<br />
It was like something I couldn’t reach was squeezing my face and tugging on my hair. I had no illusions that this wasn’t what I suspected. But it’s a different matter altogether to realize it. Just saying “whoa” is underselling it. It was like my entire existence and feeling as a human being was being pushed and pulled and torn and twisted like hot taffy on a summer day and I had no idea what I was going to end up as.<br />
<br />
My clothes lost the Millennium Falcon to become kind of a different material. That was a bummer because I really liked that graphic. I wound up in a skirt too and just processing all of that took till everything kind of settled down. <br />
<br />
My legs felt so soft and free of everything that they were kind of cold and empty but also so full too. Those breasts also seemed surreal from this angle, just a massive thing rising out of that sweater. I could understand how saying “sweater puppies” might be uncomfortable when you got a set of big dogs. It called for another “whoa”. <br />
<br />
Ty asked if that was me and I wasn’t even sure if I was me anymore. Adjusting those clothes meant manipulating the most obvious aspects of a girl. I wasn’t ready to go for that expanse. Just sort of lingering around it and feeling the way my body pushed against it was a rush of both adrenaline and so many crazy chemicals inside my head.<br />
<br />
I kind of got carried away. I had plenty of access to the Internet along with a handful of films that admitted certain things. I knew how a girl could get off and I was one. If this was highly temporary then I just wanted to feel a few things before it went away. I pressed my immensely soft fleshy legs together especially at the thighs and bounced my knee. Not having any balls or my regular dick between my legs, I can only imagine what was down there but the Internet provided me with enough visual aids. <br />
<br />
It felt compressed and tightened. It was like folding over and inside the most delicate skin around my nuts and between the shaft and the balls. Just pulling them taught and yet loose. And at the pinnacle was a tight aching little spot that actually tried to wander a bit as I played this tune. The heat and the wetness and the emptiness but also odd fullness and unfurling sensation sucked away all other thoughts as I tried to push closer and harder. The jolts to my breasts made me think of what more I could do. Holy fuck, I was about to cream my panties with what felt like a volcano stirring underneath. <br />
<br />
And then I remembered I was in the middle of the dorm common room about ready to grind the billiards table to finish. I could see that Ty was watching. Words were no easier for me right then but I still managed to get them out about the situation and what happened to me. I even mentioned my aunt, who was about as big as I was now. <br />
<br />
The other guy noped out of there right then and I couldn’t blame him. <br />
<br />
Ty and I got a little bit closer and I could feel something going on. But he also wanted to get out of there. I saw him with a different flavor to my feeling than usual. He was a man but I was a woman. And call it aroma or presence or whatever but there was something new and exciting about him, even though nothing had changed about him. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before I invoked our promise but I also qualified it by saying I wasn’t sure about anything yet, so he would have to give me a minute. <br />
<br />
We made our way out and over to the left to climb the stairs to the second level. Our room was right there. Ty fumbled with the key in the lock. He definitely could be antsy. At the same time, I wasn’t sure where to keep my hands.<br />
<br />
Inside, the dorm looked about the same as I expected, but the room we shared had different decorations. It definitely looked more like a chick’s place on my side. But that didn’t upset me too much because it still had an aesthetic I approved of. There were these big pinned up flags for video games kinda like a drawn together celebration of the nations of gaming. My bed looked and smelled a lot better than usual but considering my method of cleaning tended to be just aiming and emptying whatever Febreze canister I could find, doing much of anything would’ve been an improvement. There was just one muscle guy poster on the side and the rest was a lot of fantasy nature and fantastical creatures with a nice edge. There were also plenty of sci-fi landscapes over by my bed. My prized Millennium Falcon replica scale model had not been messed with and that was the biggest thing. The closet had more of a look towards fashion but, at the same time, the girl I had become still nurtured geekdom. And her name was Trisha. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t necessarily the name I would choose for myself, but it did sound familiar as one that my parents tossed around before they knew what I was going to be. Casually, I sat down on Ty’s bed and looked over at him as he sat down as well.<br />
<br />
Well, here it was. The unlikely scenario. Looking down, it was insane how much of me swelled out. The immense spread was larger, it felt, than my head. All sorts of ideas for what to do with it occurred to me. I hadn’t even gotten a proper look in a mirror yet. <br />
<br />
Our roommates in the other room weren’t gonna be around till later because of their classes, so it was just us. Ty looked nervous and I felt uncertain myself. He smelled good though. Not anything that he was wearing but instead this olfactory aura around him which I couldn’t explain except as being part and parcel of what I was now. <br />
<br />
Before he said anything, I hopped up with an obvious series of jiggles and said I had to use the restroom. He leaned forward like he was about to ask if he could tagalong but he held his tongue. In the bathroom, I took care of a little bit of business with the new plumbing. I wasn’t exactly a fan, as whipping it out definitely had more convenience. And it just felt like taking a reverse shower instead of aiming a blast. It had a lot of collateral consequences. After cleaning myself, I took a little while to see how I looked now. <br />
<br />
She could definitely be my sister in the face. Not outrageously pretty. But those green eyes were not bad. Kinda like my grandmother. She had the family nose with just a little bit of trim to it. The hair would take some getting used to. But my God those titties.<br />
<br />
I could tell there was a shelf in front of me and it pulled on every one of the muscles in the entire area from my pants to my neck to around my back to part of my lower back to almost even my legs. It was a whole thing, not even counting the way all those new spots felt like almost plush softness in a different sort of skin. <br />
<br />
It was surreal because I could look in the mirror and see a girl there instead of myself. I could see her squirm a little when I moved about and I could see her play with those titties. Feeling it all was the biggest rush because I had no idea about the thresholds and what buttons to push. It was like going down a mountain without any way to break.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I just had to let go and hope and pray that everything would slow down. Back in the room, I figured Ty knew I was doing something with how long I was away. Looking at him, I could still feel the residual heat and energy.<br />
<br />
Leaning against the wall, I spoke, “So, what we promised. I’m not gonna back out. Are you good? Do you wanna do this?”<br />
<br />
Ty eagerly nodded but made sure that I was cool. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any condoms around because it wasn’t an immediate concern. Nor did our roommates. My first reaction was “I don’t care” but I had to think and reflect that, no matter what caused this, I seemed to have all the parts and if there was an oopsie, I’d have to deal with that the rest of my life.</p>
