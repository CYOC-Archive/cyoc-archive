<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There... that&#39;s everything,&quot; Sophie sighed as she helped JC and Pauline back the last of the things they would be taking to SMU in preparation for the long drive to Texas for the start of college.<br />
<br />
Of the original Animalia Ambassadoria cast going off to college, they had the farthest to go, and it would take a lot of time to unpack things as needed. The money saved from the Animalia Ambassadoria show that Animalia had paid then had done a lot to cover both the college tuition, books, and other necessities but also the ability to travel between the college and Lyre for things like Thanksgiving and Christmas, and that could be easily handled by flying by plane. The only &quot;big&quot; events would be moving in in the fall and moving out in the spring, and as mid August progressed, that was what the Albers and Luwrie families were working on. Thankfully the map and the route were planned out well enough that both families would be able arrive together. The only thing that was &quot;upsetting&quot; was the dorm arrangements, which Pauline decided to remind Sophie on.<br />
<br />
&quot;All this to be apart from JC,&quot; Pauline grumbled, &quot;why do these colleges insist on not recognizing bond mates?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think many colleges would accept that Roland and I are mates and that you and JC are mates,&quot; Sophie answered with a sigh as she brought the back door to the Albers&#39; family van down, &quot;but married couples would be able to apply for separate housing which would be separate from the dormitories… and most of the rules would say that college freshmen MUST stay in the dorms. And thus we must abide by the dorm&#39;s rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pauline scowled, making it clear that she didn&#39;t like it. Sophie sighed as she really didn&#39;t like it either, but there wasn&#39;t that much that could really be done on that issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;From the rules they have... they do allow for visits within certain hours,&quot; JC assured his mate, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can manage something... and maybe get paired married housing next year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be the spirit,&quot; Sophie smiled as her parents came out the door, car keys jingling as they.<br />
<br />
Mr. Albers looked to them as he opened the drivers&#39; door, &quot;all packed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Pauline acknowledged with JC and Sophie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then climb in,&quot; Mr. Albers spoke while his wife climbed into the front passenger seat, &quot;the Luwries are already on the road and we want to arrive at the appropriate stops at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, dad,&quot; Sophie answered and they all climbed in as they prepared for what would be a long drive that would take longer than the others would take, partially because of the distance to travel and partially because of the errand that Sophie and Roland had in Dino City on the way...<br />
<br />

<br />
On Heiya Island, Shuixing was barely holding it together as she and Nate walked from the home and residence that the Five Elements had to live in. A part of her knew she had to expect this and accept it, but that didn&#39;t mean she had to like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, dear,&quot; Nate said to her softly as he held her hand, &quot;this is my senior year and I do have some friends on campus... And I&#39;ll be safe and smart. Dad has already ordered a bunch of masks from Animalia that would work with me and given the email instructions that I&#39;m not to take them off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing managed a small nod at that. That was part of what she knew and accepted, as Nate was scheduled to go back to the University of Wisconsin for his senior year there, and they&#39;d known that this was a major possibility even when she finally got to claim him as her mate and he became a male Water Buffalo Animalian for her. A part of her was also glad that Nate&#39;s father and stepmother were taking added steps to keep Nate safe, given all the odd news coming out of America regarding their situation with Covid, fires, and everything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll still write?&quot; Shuixing asked as Heiya Island&#39;s airport came into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can Skype and talk to each other too,&quot; Nate promised, &quot;we&#39;ve done that before... we can do that again. I&#39;ll also keep up with the lessons you&#39;ve taught me... you keep up with yours... and then we can look forward to a Kung Fu wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not how marriage in China works,&quot; Shuixing managed a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but I was looking for something to make you smile,&quot; Nate told her and gave her hand a squeeze, &quot;because I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Shuixing managed.<br />
<br />
The rest of the trip went quietly as Shuixing walked with Nate up to the gate area that lead to the terminal as he was scheduled to fly out to Milwaukee where his father, stepmother, or aunt and uncle would be driving him to the University of Wisconsin Campus. As he passed through the last baggage checks and all that, Nate turned to wave to her and Shuixing managed to wave back. As he disappeared from view, she finally turned back to head home again, she already began mentally counting down the days until something like his Thanksgiving break or Christmas when they could be together again.<br />
<br />
As she walked home, she picked out her own cellphone, hoping that there might be a text or email that Nate might have sent from the plane. But there was no text and as she got to her email, she found one there from a Malice Wesley. She recognized the name from the Animalia Ambassadoria crew, who had covered the Five Elements&#39; rescue and formal introduction to Animalia. She had the sense that they were likely going through many of the same things as they went off to college too. There were a whole bunch of episodes updates and comments that they were going off to college too, though Shuixing thought they were all starting college while Nate was getting close to finishing his. Curiously she tapped on the email.<br />
<br />
It read: &quot;Ms. Shuixing, forgive me, but I don&#39;t think I can spell your last name... I hope this finds you well. Anyway, congratulations on all the happiness you and Nate have had. The photos he&#39;s put up of you two together on Facebook are very cute... even if all this &quot;back to school stuff&quot; may interrupt some of that. It&#39;s rough, believe me, I know. Trust me, I went through some things that are very similar with my mate, Simon... and still going through them. See, while both of us are double dosed, I entered Lyre High as a Freshman with my sister, Sarah and Simon was a Senior that year. He thus went off to the police academy after graduation and when WSA opened, he was away from Animalia and me. And when he completed that, because he&#39;d already completed high school, we couldn&#39;t have all the fun that WSA provided... And now some of that is repeating, though this time it is me and Sarah going off to college while Simon stays in Animalia. So I know how tough it is to be away from one&#39;s mate. I apologize if this is rather forward... which is something Sarah says I&#39;m too forward at times... and I&#39;m sure your sisters are there for you... but if you ever need someone to chat with who has had to be apart from her mate, I&#39;m more than happy to chat via email and share some things that I found helpful. Hopefully you stay in good health and win the Year of the Ox contest when that comes up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing chuckled. It was a rather forward offer to help, but she wasn&#39;t exactly going to refuse it, as in way what Malice offered was correct. She and her sisters had always been close and that held them together and she didn&#39;t think they&#39;d ever fully drift apart because of how close they&#39;d been. But until recently, Shuixing was the only one that had caught the eye of anyone, and Nate proved himself to be a &quot;keeper&quot; as the Americans called it. If this Husky Animalian understood, sharing an email or two from time to time couldn&#39;t hurt. She answered an affirmative and was about to put her phone away when a text came in. She checked it and found it was from Nate. It read, &quot;Just reached cruising altitude and I could put my phone on. I miss you already.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
At the Brown Farm, Abby and Samson&#39;s departure was a bit different than most of the others in that she and Samson were able to drive together and that in terms of distance, they actually had the shortest to go. Sophie and Roland had both sent some picture texts as they crossed state lines and showed the changes in scenery. The shots of the Grand Canyon were fairly good, given it was a photo taken by phone and going over a bridge at high speed, but the were still riding with their parents. The others were also getting rides from their parents too. Abby and Samson didn&#39;t have that, as her father had essentially &quot;loaned&quot; them the truck he&#39;d gotten after the Browns became Horse Animalians as well. Neither Samson nor Abby expected the loan of the vehicle, but they weren&#39;t going to complain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s everything,&quot; Samson spoke as he began snapping the clasps to then secure the synthetic tarp that normally covered the bed of the truck, &quot;thankfully our dorms are adjoining...&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby nodded as she dusted herself off after loading some of her things into the bed beside Samson&#39;s things. Together they covered most of the bed of the truck. Most of it was hers, as Samson&#39;s sense of decoration was still rather spartan in many ways, but Abby had also noted that over the past four years, Samson&#39;s intellect had grown quite a lot. True he wasn&#39;t going going to set any records for intelligence, and Abby also had to admit that she probably wasn&#39;t going to either. The most intellectual of her group of friends had almost always been Sophie, but it wasn&#39;t as though she and Samson were dumb. And to a certain extent, Samson&#39;s growth was impressive in that regard, and that made Abby happy. Of course, it also set the stage on competition on who would drive.<br />
<br />
Both she and Samson had gotten their driver&#39;s licenses, but for the most part they&#39;d only driven along the farm and in Animalia to run errands. That was in a rather limited space and with less need than Jessica had had for her own bug. Some of that was that as Quarter Horse Animalians, she and Samson could cover ground quickly and easily, and thus driving wasn&#39;t as necessary... until today as they packed and prepared to head off to college.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... will you drive or shall I?&quot; Abby said to Samson when she heard the front door open and then slam closed.<br />
<br />
She turned to see two familiar Horse Animalians. One a coal black male, and only slightly smaller than Samson and the other a slightly lighter brown mare than Abby was herself. Her parents, Martin and Josephine Brown. They came out with smiles, even though they were still dressed for work. After all, the farm&#39;s work never really stopped and now that fall was coming, the year&#39;s apple crop was ready to be brought in. Abby hated leaving her parents short handed, particularly when some of their helpers seemed to make passes at Samson or Martin when they thought she or Josephine weren&#39;t looking, but her parents had said college was important, especially if the farm was to be expanded after she graduated. They&#39;d also added that if Abby and Samson decided to start on their own or set to work with her uncle in Montana in four years, it would make sense for Abby to have a degree and some scholarly learning to help out her years of &quot;on the job training&quot; on the Brown farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;You drive, Abby,&quot; Martin spoke, &quot;the truck is in my name... and Samson won&#39;t officially be a Brown until you two get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve treated her right, sir,&quot; Samson said quickly, which earned a few chuckles. <br />
<br />
Martin was only playing and Abby got the sense of that. The two of them got along quite well and Abby also had the suspicion that if things ever went down in a bad way, Samson was stronger. But that didn&#39;t stop some playful jokes that at times Samson did fall for, and once he realized that that Abby was laughing to, Samson joined in.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve watched you treat her right for four years, Samson,&quot; Josephine gave an approving smile, &quot;you&#39;ve more than earned our trust and approval. And we know that Abby loves you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love her, Mrs. Brown,&quot; Samson answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me mom,&quot; Josephine insisted, &quot;we&#39;ll be in-laws when you and Abby marry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby was certain that Samson was trying to blush through his fur when he didn&#39;t answer. The two of them were certain they would get married, but that was still something they hadn&#39;t planned on doing until after college. And Martin and Josephine came up to hug Abby as she and Samson moved around the truck. They also shook hands with Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to get going on our own work soon...&quot; Josephine said, &quot;so we wanted to give you both a quick send off and make sure you have everything... Masks... PPE.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mom,&quot; Abby answered as she returned her mother&#39;s nuzzles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Birth control pills,&quot; Josephine then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooooom!&quot; Abby groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just making sure, dear,&quot; Josephine spoke, &quot;you know our fall mating season is coming up... and while I want to be a grandmother... I&#39;d prefer it NOT  be while you&#39;re still in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be safe, mom,&quot; Abby promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;And remember that we love you,&quot; Martin added as he hugged his daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, dad,&quot; Abby answered, &quot;don&#39;t let single mares get to you too much... it&#39;ll irritate you that work isn&#39;t getting done and irritate mom that her stallion is being flirted with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I try... but your mother knows my eyes are only for her,&quot; Martin managed, to which Josephine nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll give our love to Goldenrod?&quot; Samson asked.<br />
<br />
Martin and Josephine nodded as Abby and Samson moved back to the truck, Samson handing Abby the keys as they passed each other. Martin and Josephine stayed on the driveway as the climbed into the cab and were soon off, with the ultimate destination being the private ag college in Oregon. Geographically, it was actually the closest of the colleges that the Animalia Ambassadoria crew were going to, but it was also more rural and isolated and off of some of the bigger roads. Abby had her worries about getting around the fires to get to it, but all the maps and road warnings gave an indication that things were clear and that the college was still taking people back in person. And before they got too far away, they managed one last wave to Martin and Josephine who waved back.<br />
<br />

<br />
In terms of the buildings and layout, Dino City hadn&#39;t changed since Roland and Sophie were last there. There were few more Dinotopians there now, but some of that made some degree of sense. There were also some Humans that were there, which made sense. When most people thought of Dinosaurs and the creatures of the Mesozoic Era, they thought of the giant animals like the Sauropods or the giant Theropods and didn&#39;t know much about the smaller Dinosaurs and Pterosaurs that would be smaller than Humans. Thus when Project Mesozoic went public, most people likely thought of the larger Dinosaur species and decided to wait until a place like Dino City was built. However, that wasn&#39;t the reason for the stop.<br />
<br />
The stop was more in relation to things that would move forward with Animalia Ambassadoria. Contrary to what Malice had often repeated, Sophie and Roland were only there to see if they could get Dino City&#39;s mayor, William Tarr, to assure them that the new Animalia Ambassadoria team would have an office to do their broadcasts from when in Dino City. While the city had done well enough to allow Animalia Ambassadoria access to events and facilities, broadcasting areas weren&#39;t as available. This meant that when Sophie and Roland had visited in the past for things like the IAC&#39;s games in Dino City, they were uploaded from either their hotel room, the hotel lobby, or from some other public place and this occasionally included some background noise that was hard to ignore. There were also the issues of trying to stay out of people&#39;s way as they tried to go about their day. A sort of office space, even if it was small would give the new team a place to upload in peace and without being rushed, which would be helpful since the new team wouldn&#39;t have any Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
Once they were done, they would then continue on their way to Dallas and their college at SMU. Roland&#39;s parents parked in one of the visitor parking spots in front of city hall and the Albers parked beside them. Roland managed to get out and walk forward along the passenger side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think this will take too long,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;from all things that I&#39;ve heard... Mr. Tarr seems relatively reasonable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay, dear,&quot; his mother said calmly, &quot;we have a couple of errands to run here while you, Sophie, JC, and Pauline are busy. Just wait here if you get done before we get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Roland said slowly as he sighed.<br />
<br />
He, Abby, JC, and Pauline stepped up onto the sidewalk as their parents both backed out and began to drive off in the general direction of Horizon. That left Roland with a small sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think they&#39;ll...&quot; Roland began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so,&quot; Sophie said slowly, &quot;at least not on this trip...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You speak on the prospect of your parents converting as a bad thing,&quot; Pauline commented, &quot;we&#39;ve all enjoyed being Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Sophie sighed, &quot;but there is... I don&#39;t know an odd sort of sense that kids won&#39;t want to know that their parents are interested in sex...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And particularly when our moms seem to make references to Luke or Andrew,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;they aren&#39;t even Animalians and its like they have a one track mind at times...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they wanted US to wait,&quot; Sophie grumbled, &quot;but its a lot of that sort of thing that could be uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah and Malice have had no trouble with their parents becoming Animalians... neither has Abby,&quot; JC pointed out, &quot;granted a Dinotopian would be different... and if its a large species they might need to move here for the elbow room...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re okay... but it&#39;s sort of a changed relationship,&quot; Roland commented as they made their way toward the doors to Dino City&#39;s City Hall, &quot;sort of like they respond to their parents more as a sibling/best friend scenario rather than a parental one. Possibly because they were both double dosed... It&#39;s nothing necessarily wrong... it just takes some adapting to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then if it happens, than we&#39;d all have to adapt then,&quot; JC reminded them, &quot;they can, after all change their minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roland and Sophie both nodded and made their way in. It was one of the things that both knew they had to accept, no matter how uneasy it was, though they still didn&#39;t think that their parents would become Dinotopians, particularly large Dinotopians while in the middle of the move to college. And for the moment they couldn&#39;t focus on that. They made their way in and mentioned an appointment to speak with William Tarr. They were ushered into a conference room and the four sat down and waited quietly for a few moments. It wasn&#39;t long before the still Human mayor of Dino City came into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m late... I&#39;ve been busy with some things...&quot; William Tarr began as he shuffled a couple of papers in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Election stuff?&quot; Pauline wondered, thinking on the elections in November that were set to formally establish Dino City&#39;s full city government rather than the temporary one voted on as part of Dino City&#39;s establishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... wedding planning and other issues,&quot; William Tarr gave a near groan, &quot;this pandemic has everyone on edge and has slowed down a lot... even with the governor wanting stuff open. And its scared people... scared my sister and her family, and I&#39;d want her to be there when I say &quot;I do&quot; with Candace... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t wish to pry, sir,&quot; Roland spoke up, &quot;and if people are scared of all the Covid stuff... it might be best not to force them into anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
William Tarr nodded at that, &quot;Of course... now, what can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mostly a request,&quot; Sophie spoke up, &quot;for with our group&#39;s tour on Animalia Ambassadoria over... as we go off to college, a new team will be taking over from us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen that...&quot; William Tarr nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And well... we were hoping there was some space that you could set aside for the new team to be able to upload and broadcast from,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;you know... things like any IAC events in the future in Dino City and so on... and other major events.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not establishing this whole new team?&quot; William Tarr asked with narrowing eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Roland answered, &quot;Malice can get a bit... ahead of herself as it were. They do know that Dino City&#39;s general news coverage is good enough... but I think she&#39;s always wanted to go by what sounds the most fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not professional, if you ask me,&quot; William Tarr grumbled, &quot;but I&#39;d think we can set aside this room at certain times of the day and on specific days for update videos.&quot; He then set the papers down and fiddled around until he found one that was blank. He then took out a pen and wrote down the number for Dino City&#39;s City Hall on it. &quot;This is the number you can send to your new team in Animalia. When we get to the IAC here again or there is something big to announce here, have them call the number and set the schedule for when they expect to arrive and how long they intend to stay in town. Once that is all settled they&#39;d then have a quite place with a good internet connection to handle things. I trust that serves your purposes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it would,&quot; Roland nodded, &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, William Tarr was soon back on his way with the papers he was wrestling with as well as trying to get things scheduled for his own romantic affairs. That left the four Dinotopians alone for a few moments as they collected themselves. Sophie collected the paper, noted the number and then lead them out The stop wasn&#39;t much of a mission, but it was one they had. Thankfully things had been quick and things had been clarified as to what was expected in that Dino City might get some special moments where Animalia Ambassadoria would give some updates on things, but given the media needs of the small town it wouldn&#39;t have the more regular coverage that Animalia got. The four of them made their way back out, finding that even in August, Texas was still hot, and their parents weren&#39;t back yet. However, after a few moments, the Luwrie and Albers vehicles did come back into view and parked before Dino City&#39;s city hall. As Roland moved to climb back into the back seat of the Luwrie car, he found that both his and Sophie&#39;s parents were still normal Humans. Which meant that if there were any conversion plans... it wasn&#39;t on this trip... From there the drive resumed toward Dallas.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at UNLV, Jessica, Roger, Sarah, Malice, and Travis were going about their own steps at unpacking. The drive down hadn&#39;t been two bad, and Jessica had largely followed her parents down in her bug with Roger riding beside her. From there they would have their things to unload from the back of the Mariana&#39;s family vehicle. Roger&#39;s &quot;adoptive&quot; Human parents were presently in Washington heling Codey unpack his things there, which left Roger a bit on his own, but he wasn&#39;t really alone in that department. Travis was also in that role as his parents were again being volunteered and sent to aid the fire-fighters in California presently battling the blazes there and it was something done in a rotation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat that we&#39;re all in the same building, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Sarah asked to Jessica as they moved to carry another armload of things in.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame we&#39;re not in the same rooms or floors though,&quot; Jessica nodded as they entered through the main doorway, &quot;but I think things will be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few calls of &quot;wait&quot; came after them to get them to turn to see Belle and Bash coming after Sarah. The three year olds were carrying a few things that were Sarah&#39;s and non breakable, and Sarah smiled at her younger siblings wanting to help. She accepted it and did her best to keep them close. The journey down from Lyre was a bit of an adventure for the Wesleys, as since they were having to bring Travis down, so that his parents could rest, Belle and Bash came along too. And the two younger Animalians often moved between helping Sarah or helping their parents help Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you met your roommate, yet?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but we only just got here,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;there will be plenty of time for that to come...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things,&quot; came a new voice, making both turn to see Princess and Tiffany sitting at a sort of booth set up near one of the entryways. The now college senior sat calmly and quietly and there was a lot of the stuff that Jessica had seen when high school began that wasn&#39;t there now. Though, some of that relates to her getting Riley&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you two up to?&quot; Sarah wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly looking for any familiar faces,&quot; Princess commented, &quot;seeing who&#39;d wish to sign up to join the PET House.&quot;<br />
<br />
This drew some attention as Malice and Travis approached with the Wesleys, Roger, and the Marianas coming along behind. Their rooms were all on different floors, but by a stroke of luck, they were all in the same building. It made unpacking easy and wouldn&#39;t prevent them from seeing each other from time to time. The two poodle Animalians did take note of the increased attention, as well as with Belle and Bash coming more into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will opportunities for fun, intermural sports, and some additional study help,&quot; Princess offered, &quot;among other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would sound fun,&quot; Jessica commented, &quot;though we are just moving in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Tiffany answered, &quot;we&#39;ll be here all day... and keep in mind it could give you leadership opportunities too. You gals and your bond-mates gained a lot of popularity at Lyre High... even before Princess and I graduated. And we&#39;re looking to graduate this coming May too. Which means... you could end up being the Sorority/Fraternity&#39;s elected leaders too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought it&#39;d be early to begin discussing officers, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; Roger wondered as he looked to the two Poodle Animalians.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... but it&#39;d be incentive to join, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; Tiffany smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Belle spoke up.<br />
<br />
That was enough to get Julia to want to usher her younger pups along. The cute innocence of the declaration was fine, but she had her own memories of her own sorority, and knew that that wasn&#39;t something Belle or Bash should be exposed to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe when your older, dear,&quot; Julia said to Belle, &quot;now, lets help your sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Belle answered as the group began to break up, though Jessica, Sarah, and Malice agreed to come back and visit more with Tiffany after they were all moved in and younger siblings wouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>
