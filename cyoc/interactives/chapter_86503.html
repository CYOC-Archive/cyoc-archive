<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob decided to humor the salesman and quickly swiped up a few at the same time, took a casual glace down, and tossed them down the hatch. He could taste a medley of flavors as he chewed them up. White chocolate, dark chocolate, caramel, and coconut all blended together wonderfully. <br />
<br />
He shrugged and swallowed them down. As he went to grab his drink across the table to clear his palate. He could feel a rumble start to grow in his stomach. Pulling back his arm he could see his skin pull taught against his hand. Flipping it over he could see his palm pulsing, veins literally growing up and out. The feeling intensified as he could see his skin on the forearm suck in. Raising his other arm he could see the same occurring. The spider webs that were his veins became almost grotesque in their coverage of his body, throbbing and pulsing with the power of the chocolates. <br />
<br />
Feeling movement under his shirt made him pull the collar away and peer downward. What once was a so-so body was starting to get shockingly thin. Ribs becoming visible and more pronounced per second.<br />
<br />
Taking a step backward his pants simply slid down his near anorexic looking waist, pooling around his ankles. Pulling his shirt off quickly he glanced over to the mirror by the door. He immediately thought of Christian Bale in the Machinist only he was thinner. He was amazed to see muscle definition as he just assumed he didn&#39;t have any. <br />
<br />
Thinking something was seriously off with what he had done. He rushed to the box nearly falling over his pants and looked at the guide. He could see the culprit, white chocolate belly. Not being especially large to begin with he was now so far below what was considered normal he began to panic. Every detail was there. Looking closely, he could see his heart beating. He looked like a bio class poster from high school. What if he had eaten too many at once or perhaps he ate two in a row?<br />
<br />
Pulse rate increasing drastically he began to shake. Was it a panic attack? He never had one before. He was expecting to pass out, but instead he felt another rumble deep in his gut. Nearly wretching from the pain he could feel his abdominals pulse beneath his hands. His legs started to quiver and pulse the same. He grabbed a nearby chair and sat down. <br />
<br />
Running his hands over his legs, as if they had fallen asleep, he could now feel what was happening. His quads were growing! Seconds passed and he was adding pounds and inches to his skeleton. With skin pulled so tight he could see the sinew bulging and growing out. He began to feel himself being lifted by the growing ass muscles he now possessed. Glancing down and back he could see an amazing bubble butt forming that would make any body builder jealous.  Soon though that motion was becoming more difficult as lats started to push against the chair back. Turning back around he felt pecs pushing out and down (and up seemingly) as they started their own growth. He looked less and less skinny and quickly was headed towards dedicated fitness nut. <br />
<br />
Standing back up he could feel his skin still pulled tight across his muscles as they continued to add mass. Looking at the mirror he flexed his vein riddled bicep, imitating body builders he had seen, and smiling just as wide. The feeling seemed to ramp up again and he started to blow up!<br />
<br />
Pecs really starting to define into two separate masses glued to an increasingly wide torso, Rob could only look on in fascination, fear, and a good bit of lust.<br />
<br />
Speaking of lust he could feel the still hanging boxers pull tighter since they were just barely staying on his &quot;Bale body&quot;. The rubbing on his cockhead introduced a new sensation to his transformation, unbridled lust. He just had to get to his cock. No matter what the cost. <br />
<br />
Ripping at the front of his boxers sent the button flying away. He quickly snaked out his member and got to beating it. He wasn&#39;t even fully hard but the sensations were greater than any he&#39;d felt before. He was steel hard in a few strokes and started to increase his speed, his hand nearly a blur. <br />
<br />
His whole body getting into it caused his still growing muscles to flex and pop up. Sweat forming on his brow started to drip in his eye. As he wiped it off he felt his forearm for a few seconds. He immediately stopped stroking and looked down at his arm. He was hairy... much more than before. The itching he had been ignoring (due to more pressing matters) spread up his arm and across his body. Within seconds he could see a coat of hair spread across his chest and down his back.<br />
<br />
 &quot;My back? Oh no!&quot; Rob thought to himself. The last thing he wanted was a hairy back. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Rob his lust would not be ignored. Wrapping his hand around his cock he felt something was wrong there. He looked down and literally ran into a problem. His pecs had grown large enough to block his vision. In fact, his now chiseled chin was fighting with the crevice of his now monstrous pecs. Chin stubble now rubbed against his flowing chest hair. It was measurable in inches. <br />
<br />
Looking back to the mirror he got a view of what he was becoming... A monster, that&#39;s all he could think. His hairy pecs took up a great portion of the field of view. His cock was getting hairy and larger. He could see his nipples capping the mass of his chest growing along.<br />
<br />
 Using a second arm to assist with the problem at hand, his growing muscles bulged and fought for space. He moaned deeper than he was used to and bared his teeth some. He soon felt his lats forcing his arms out further causing him to have to bend to keep a grasp on his schlong. He started to worry more, he was easily over 300 pounds now and he just kept stroking, unable to stop now.<br />
<br />
He walked over to the chair and put a leg up to get a bit better access to his junk. Still amazed and scared as he took note that even though he had downright furry legs his could still see veins. It was becoming easier to reach his cock even as he was growing by the second. Looking in the mirror he could see his cock reeling out. Balls following suit. The pulsing in his body so strong he flexed his bent leg smashing the chair to pieces.<br />
<br />
He stumbled forward and lost his balance. Landing chest first still kept his face a foot or more from the floor. The space filled with pecs. He tried to reach around them to push himself up but now his bloated lats were pressing on huge triceps, which in turn pressed his arms into his flattened pecs. He soon realized he was stuck face down. His arms were slowly going towards 90 degrees.<br />
<br />
Even though he was loosing mobility he was still horny beyond belief. His dick was pressed tightly against his abs inching towards his pecs. He could feel the slime of his pre keeping the skin from chafing as he grew. It was wonderful to get some pressure against his aching cock. As he grew past 600 pounds that pressure only increased.<br />
<br />
He felt his quads lift his torso from the ground, that space quickly taken up by his increasingly large ball sack. Rob was starting to resign himself to becoming a giant mass of muscle, cock, and hair. His cock now sliding up his chest rubbing the forest of hair. He lost all concern of what he was turning into when he felt his balls pull tight. He knew he was going to cum and if the sandbag size balls were any indication it was going to be big.<br />
<br />
He started to use what movement was left hump his cock against his swelling abs and pecs. Pre flowing like a river as it came from the crease on his pecs. The scent of sweat and musk finally providing the release he was desperate for. He arched his back as the knots of muscle bunched up completely covering his spine from daylight. <br />
<br />
Cum blasted from his head at such a force Rob blacked out for a second. He could feel his muscles tense and grow all at once closing off sound and partial vision from reaching his head. At probably 3/4 of a ton, he was just a serious ball of male and he loved it.<br />
<br />
The cum pool starting to get depth in the small room was worrying Rob until he realized he was still growing. And it was a concrete slab supporting him. His pecs would keep him safe for now. He growled deeply in satisfaction.<br />
<br />
He started to doze off in the most amazing afterglow any human had experienced ever.<br />
<br />
He was startled awake a few minutes later by a knock at the door.</p>
