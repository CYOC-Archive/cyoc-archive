<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still panting, you try to put your mind back together enough to make a response. You kind of wish the more experienced Darin had taken the initiative -- but maybe... maybe he didn&#39;t want to make a decision for you because he considers you weaker?<br />
<br />
<i>Whatever...</i> You swallow, imagining the black brand around your neck.  Imagining serving the succubus. You lick your lips in anticipation, your cock shuddering. <i>Yes! Wait, no...</i> Was her magic messing with your mind to such an extent?<br />
<br />
You swallow again, trying to focus on your dream of becoming a hero. You can&#39;t succumb to this demon now. <i>A hero... with this damned thing?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;What about... this?&quot; you rasp, rubbing at the scar again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will disappear once you&#39;ve served your time. You will both be restored to normal once I release you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right...&quot; You have no choice but to trust her now. You&#39;re very much regretting your decision to do so in the first place -- the dwarves certainly seem like the lesser of the two evils <i>now</i>. But the past is past. You can only hope that she keeps her end of the bargain.<br />
<br />
And hope that you can cling to sanity until then. Three days of this kind of torment... you&#39;re not certain you can take that. This is already worse than your worst imaginings of what a succubus could do. On the other hand, who knows what &quot;favours&quot; she might exact of you in the future? It makes you shiver.<br />
<br />
So a compromise might be best. And you don&#39;t have a lot of time to weigh the balance. Darin reminds you of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up, mate. Ain&#39;t much more &#39;n two minutes left.<br />
<br />
<i>Shit.</i> You nod. You&#39;re leery of giving in to your impulse to serve the demoness, but... better to get it down with now, maybe, then give her too much room to blackmail you in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;One favour.&quot; You lift your head, and moisten your lips. &quot;We&#39;ll serve you two days, and owe you one favour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are in agreement?&quot; the succubus asks of Darin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let it be so. For the next forty-eight hours, you are my slaves; afterwards you are free, until I wish to call in those favours. Now stand up.&quot; Both of you scramble to obey. &quot;Look around.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you do so, you realise that beyond the stone floor and magic circle, which has ceased glowing, you haven&#39;t registered any of the room you&#39;re in yet. It is quite a spacious chamber. Alchemical apparatus and unknown machinery lines the wall to your left, separated from the magic circle in the centre by several tables fitted with restraints. On the wall in front of you, behind the succubus, is a door flanked by shelves and cabinets holding bottles, vials, and other things. To your right are more tables, and bookshelves beyond them.<br />
<br />
At the succubus&#39; direction, you turn around to see that the rear wall is bare except for a number of metal shackles hanging from the stone. Your stomach flops over and sinks as she directs you and Darin to them. She conjures a key, and has you both lock your ankles in. You do it numbly, afraid to test the compulsion you feel; but Darin evidently struggles. His hands tremble, teeth clenched as he attempts to keep from slipping the key into the little hole. But...<br />
<br />
<i>Click.<br />
<br />
Click.</i><br />
<br />
Now you both stand with your backs to the wall, your feet held apart by the shackles. The succubus laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure which of you is better entertainment. Trying to play along and hoping it won&#39;t be so bad, or thinking you can resist. Now, you...&quot; She points to Darin. &quot;Lock your friend&#39;s hand in the manacle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t!&quot; he protests. She just smiles.<br />
<br />
Fresh sweat breaks out on Darin&#39;s forehead. He clenches his fist around the key, his knuckles turning white. Then with a grunt he tugs at the chains on his feet, turning to you as best he can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, I... I can&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Darin,&quot; you reassure him, trying to force a smile. &quot;Just get it...&quot; You grunt as a powerful throb from your groin distracts you. He nods.<br />
<br />
Restrained as he is, following the succubus&#39; order is not easy. But he shuffles against the wall, struggling to get your wrist aligned with the manacle. After several minutes of wrestling against the chains, he manages to close the shackle and turn the key in the lock.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHOA!&quot; As soon as he stops straining, he loses his balance, falling forward -- into the succubus&#39; arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job, pet,&quot; she says, half-mocking, half-praising. You see the hairs along Darin&#39;s back stir as he looks up, struck to his core by his response to her compliment. He <i>liked</i> it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn b-&quot; He presses his lips together, remembering what happened the last time he called her a bitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gooood pet,&quot; she coos. &quot;I think you deserve a little reward.&quot; She adjusts him a bit, bringing his head to the top of her bust. &quot;Lick, slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hesitates just long enough for you to notice, then with a growl he sets his tongue to the smooth surface of her upper boob. The succubus moans in approval, petting his matted hair as the thin sheen of her sweat is replaced by Darin&#39;s saliva. His growl turns into a whimper as the taste of her infernal flesh heats his body, and again, despite himself, he finds himself enjoying the mix of salt and some erotic oil.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough.&quot; She pushes him away, setting him back against the wall. &quot;We don&#39;t want you getting too excited and wasting your seed on the floor. Now raise your arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can hear his teeth grinding, but this time he obeys immediately. The succubus summons the key from the floor to her hand. Humming, she locks in first one wrist and then the other; then she moves to you to secure your remaining hand. Now you are both spread against the stone in an &quot;X&quot;, your enormous cocks jutting out painfully in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why bother?&quot; spits out Darin as she turns, tail twitching in satisfaction, and struts over to one of the mysterious machines. &quot;Why not just tell us to stand still? Since we have to do whatever you fucking say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s hard to stand still when you&#39;re orgasming, pet,&quot; she replies. She grabs a pair of... things... from the machine. They were are long, narrow, black and shiny. Your parochial existence has never been exposed to advanced equipment such as nozzles; but these are no ordinary nozzles, for they pulse in her hands, hungrily sucking at the air as if alive. Behind them, long, transparent tubes play out of the machine as the succubus walked back towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides. It&#39;s more fun to do it this way. Now, two days isn&#39;t a lot of time to break you, so let&#39;s get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before you can finish the question, the succubus answers by sliding the thing over your dick. Your eyes go wide, your voice gasping and groaning as the black thing bulges obscenely with your meat, slurping around you until it gets a good grip and seals shut. The inside of it is hot and wet, and it ripples and contracts around you, tugging and massaging.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, bi- arrrgh...&quot; Darin tries to pull away, but of course he can&#39;t, and a &quot;Hold still&quot; from the succubus freezes him in place. Tears squeeze from his eyes as she slips the sucker over his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now enjoy,&quot; she commands, stepping back. Immediately Darin begins thrusting against the device, and you imitate him with a moan of helpless pleasure. Rattling your chain as your start to buck your hips. And -- pent up as you are -- you soon begin to pump into the greedy machine. You watch, blushing in shame and disgust as white fluid runs up the tubes into the main black bulk of the device, then collecting in glass tubes that hang underneath it.<br />
<br />
To your surprise, however, the suction does not stop -- and neither does your cock. A second orgasm follows hard on the first, tearing a scream of pleasure from you, echoed by Darin. The succubus also sighs in release, having slipped her fingers into her dripping pussy as she relishes your humiliation. She chuckles. putting your cheek with her wet fingers; then walks over to her equipment, not even deigning to watch further as her machine milks you.<br />
<br />
And you feel hornier than ever! Soon you&#39;re pushed to a third orgasm, the living nozzle sucking up every drop of seed you produce. And still your balls feel heavy, almost bloated, as they churn up more and more nut butter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrgh... wh-what&#39;s... something&#39;s happening... to us!&quot; Darin manages to say. You look at him, trying to hold off your orgasm to process his words. But it&#39;s no use. Once more your body arches, your cock pumping your essence into the hungry maw of the collection device.<br />
<br />
And this time it does not stop. Your mind slips away into a rolling white sea of bliss as your swollen cock keeps pumping and pumping, spurts of seed becoming a continuous stream. And -- as Darin had realised -- as the machine sucks your essence out of you, your bodies are changing. Losing muscle mass, losing hair. Under the influence of the demonic equipment, your balls are converting your literal male essence into seed, draining your manhood from you in a torrent of pleasure.<br />
<br />
You are perhaps more fortunate than Darin, since you do not realise what&#39;s happening, even as the shackles loosen around your narrowing wrists. The mercenary however knows, and watches in horror as the pecs and abs he spent decades honing recede into effeminate smoothness. As his bulging arms waste into fragile delicacy.<br />
<br />
But the suction is inexorable, the stimulation of his dick irresistable. He cannot stop himself from cumming. And as one orgasm blurs into another and he begins to yield a constant stream as well, his mind breaks. His tongue lolls out, his body relaxing in blissful surrender.<br />
<br />
You do notice as your balls begin to lose mass. Nearly empty, you begin to experience separate orgasms again; and you can feel them pulling into you, getting smaller with each burst, until finally they are gone. You realise with a jolt that your penis is shrinking too -- just before you gasp in a final, weak release and it disappears. With nothing left to suck, the nozzle pulls back, the hose automatically retracting into the machine.<br />
<br />
Hanging your head in exhaustion, your jaw goes slack as you see what has become of you. Although not as big or as chiseled as Darin, your years on the farm followed by training in the militia had left you with a respectable amount of muscle. It&#39;s all gone, together with your body hair.<br />
<br />
But the real horror lies between your legs. Your crotch is empty. You have literally been emasculated: no cock, no balls; only a little hole to piss through. You&#39;re not a man any more. You&#39;re not really ... anything. You whimper.<br />
<br />
Beside you, Darin continues to hang limply from his shackles in a daze. You could only recognise him now from his hair colour and the tattoos, shiny with sweat and incongruous on his slender form. His face has lost all its hard angularity and rough stubble, rendering him cute and androgynous.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Darin.&quot; Your voice cracks, the timbre of manhood replaced by the high tone of a boy. &quot;Darin are... are you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be fine.&quot; The succubus has returned, and she slaps the mercenary playfully on his cheek. He blinks, then starts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gods -!&quot; He chokes on his new, sweet voice. &quot;Gods fucking damn it! Where&#39;s my dick? You crazy --&quot;<br />
<br />
She slaps him again, harder this time. &quot;Enough of that. Let&#39;s be clear: You are to speak to me with love and respect, and always refer to me as &#39;Mistress.&#39; All right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A-All...&quot; Darin struggles, then lets his head fall. &quot;All right, Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good pet. Now that I have taken what I need from you, we can have some fun.&quot; She reaches out, and rubs her hands over your smooth groins. Despite there being nothing there, the skin is still sensitive, and you both twitch and moan in protest at the pleasant touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, hm... you seem to have lost something. Let me fix that.&quot; Two vials appear between the fingers of her left hand. She takes one in her right hand. &quot;Now open your mouth... good pet...&quot;</p>
