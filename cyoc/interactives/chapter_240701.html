<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the timer for Jeff’s transformation began to tick down, he felt a growing mix of excitement and nervousness. He was about to turn himself into a child once more—something he hadn’t even thought about in years. The machine whirred softly as the countdown reached its final seconds. Jeff felt his body begin to shrink, his clothes adjusting along with it, as his height dropped and his limbs became shorter and more childlike.<br />
<br />
In mere moments, his appearance had changed completely. He now stood at about four feet tall, with his features softening and his skin growing smoother. His hair seemed to grow slightly shorter as well, and when he looked in the mirror, his reflection was that of a 9-year-old boy. The transformation was so complete, it was as though he had slipped back into a time when he was carefree, without the responsibilities of a teenager.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the result, Jeff quickly glanced at the clock, calculating how much time he had left before his mother would return to check on him. He was still curious about the device and all it could do, so an idea crossed his mind—what if he could have some fun with his mom’s transformation as well? After all, she had mentioned wanting to go back to her diaper days, so why not surprise her with exactly that?<br />
<br />
With a mischievous grin, Jeff returned to the computer. He quickly navigated to his mother’s configuration on the device. As he scrolled through the options, his mind raced with possibilities. He could make her younger, just like he had done for himself. He smiled at the idea of turning her into a little toddler again, and the more he thought about it, the more amusing it seemed.<br />
<br />
He set the transformation time for 2 minutes, just like he had for himself. Then, he carefully adjusted the age setting. He selected the age box and typed in &quot;2&quot; for her age, transforming her into a baby girl once again. He also set the duration to 60 hours, so she would stay in this toddler state until Monday morning, just like him.<br />
<br />
But then, he thought of one more thing. Since she had mentioned wanting to experience her diaper days again, he added a detail he thought would be amusing—he set the transformation to include the change in attire as well. He adjusted her clothes to be baby-like, changing her to a small onesie and diapers.<br />
<br />
With everything set, Jeff sat back and waited, a grin spreading across his face. His heart raced with anticipation—this would be such a surprise for his mom.<br />
<br />
When she returned a half hour later, Jeff was already sitting on the bed, playing with his toys in his new, smaller form. He looked up at her with wide eyes, pretending to be a bit lost in his world. His mom, who had just entered the room, blinked in surprise, clearly not expecting what she saw.<br />
<br />
“What the... Jeff?” she stammered, looking at her son, who now looked like a young child again.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled mischievously, and before she could say anything, the transformation started to take hold. The computer’s screen flickered briefly, and within seconds, his mother’s body began to shrink down. Her features softened, her eyes grew wider, and her hair shortened to the fine texture of a toddler’s. She looked at Jeff, her face a mixture of surprise and confusion, before she began to shrink further.<br />
<br />
Her clothes melted away, replaced by a colorful onesie, and her small hands turned chubby and soft. The final touch: the soft bulge of a diaper became noticeable beneath her onesie. Jeff watched in delight as his mom’s transformation completed, and before he knew it, she was a 2-year-old girl standing in front of him, her wide blue eyes staring at him curiously.<br />
<br />
The shock of the change was evident on her face as she tried to comprehend what had just happened. She looked down at herself and back at Jeff, her lips parted in a mix of disbelief and awe.<br />
<br />
“Jeff... wh-what happened to me?!” she exclaimed, her voice small and childlike.<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed softly, his grin widening as he leaned over and gave his now-tiny mother a playful nudge. “You said you wanted to go back to your diaper days, didn’t you? Well, now you can! You’re a cute little toddler, mom!”<br />
<br />
She blinked a few times, then looked down at her onesie and her tiny body. “I... I can’t believe this!” she giggled, the sound high-pitched and innocent. She seemed to be getting used to it already, her initial shock beginning to fade into something more playful. </p>
