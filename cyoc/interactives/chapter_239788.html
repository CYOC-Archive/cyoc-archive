<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer had some difficulties standing straight as she had balancing issues. Her new pair of feet felt like she was on her tip-toes and her mind was screaming that she was going to fall down any minute. Jennifer&#39;s tail was another problem. It kept moving on it&#39;s own like a third leg or an extension of her spine she had hard time controlling. She was able to move it but when she wasn&#39;t concentrating on it the tail had mind of it&#39;s own. The furry tail responded and moved depending on what Jennifer was feeling.<br />
<br />
Walking was even more difficult as Jennifer wanted to lean back but when she did that it made her balance go off. The constant moving and walking at five in the morning had awakened someone as they were knocking on Jennifer&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deary? Is everything okay? The school starts at seven and you are awake this early?&quot; Jennifer&#39;s mother&#39;s voice asked as she opened the door but instead of her mother. It was a giant raccoon on it&#39;s two feet just like in her dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Jennifer yelled as she fell to floor. &quot;Giant talking raccoon monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Har har Jennifer. There&#39;s no other giant raccoons here besides us.&quot; The raccoon shook it&#39;s head and sounded more annoyed than aggressive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...? Is it truly you?&quot; Jennifer asked from the furry raccoon who was wearing pajamas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. It&#39;s me- JENNIFER!? Why are you butt naked standing in the middle of the room?&quot; The female raccoon gasped as she saw Jennifer trying her best to do walking exercises.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What do you mean I&#39;m naked. I&#39;m fully covered with fur.&quot; Jennifer replied as she looked at herself and saw nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer dear...&quot; The raccoon who resembled her mother said and gave Jennifer a hug. &quot;I know the yesterday was too much for you. And Mommy loves you soooo much that I wanted you to give space to breath. But starting to walk around all naked in your room is... How should I put this... A bit too much... So put yourself some clothes and let&#39;s have a small talk in the kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer could only say that she was sorry. She didn&#39;t understand what was going on and told her raccoon mother that she would be downstairs in a moment. She decided to put on a plain looking gray t-shirt and gray colored panties. On the stairs she noticed how her sense of smell had gotten stronger. She could pick more scents than normal. Jennifer still struggled to walk with her tippy toes as the stairs proved to be difficult thing to ascend down this time. Jennifer had never struggled with walking this much as she shimmied all the way down.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had hard time understanding her situation as the raccoon in pajamas acted like her mother, sounded like mother but looked like an anthropomorphic raccoon woman. She struggled to maintain too long eye contact with her mother as she begun to have &#39;the talk&#39; with Jennifer at 5.20 in the morning. Chloe poured herself a cup of morning brew and sat on the table where Jennifer was already sitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearie. I know that drawing porn is your way to express yourself but this is and eight grade we are talking about. I know you have skills to draw and you want your art degree but bringing porn to school is a big no-no.&quot; Chloe begun her speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Jennifer replied back as she try to show to her mother that she was listening despite not looking at her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and remember what we talked about your human interest yesterday...&quot; Chloe continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human interests?&quot; Jennifer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Those humans you love to draw. Those furless biped things with those weird straight legs and with their lack of tails. Those ones.&quot; Her mother explained.<br />
<br />
What did her mother mean by this? Furless bipeds? She was one herself... but not right now exactly. But... It was as if she spoke like that they never- Wait a minute. That would imply that...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, don&#39;t freak out. I&#39;m going to ask maybe a bizarre question. But are humans real?&quot; Jennifer tried to ask sincerely from her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What kind of question is that? Of course humans are not real. They are pure fantasy like elves, dwarves and etc.&quot; Chloe shook her head and looked Jennifer as if she had no idea why she was asking question like that. &quot;I know that there people who claim that if our ancestor had turned into those tree climbing things. We all would look different but listen your mom&#39;s not that good at history and that&#39;s not the issue here... so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Ugh. Sorry mom. Didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; Jennifer apologized as she was now more confused what was her mom talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know dearie, I know. You mean well and I... again... I try my best you understand and keep up with you...&quot; Chloe smiled at Jennifer as she took her sip from the coffee. &quot;You know what let&#39;s move to more cheerful topics. Promise me that you won&#39;t bring porn to your school before you graduate. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled back and agreed to get herself a new sketchbook where she would draw... normal doodles from now. She would only draw at home and focus on her studies.<br />
<br />
Jennifer went back to her room to check something. She went through her collection of &#39;animal&#39; movies and noticed that every animal mascot was replaced with herbivore character or similar fantasy creature like an elf. Jennifer tried to find anything that had human in it&#39;s cover but found nothing. No pictures of humans anywhere. It was as if whole world was replaced with intellectual anthropomorphic animals that weren&#39;t humans. She opened her laptop to see that in the news there were two anthropomorphic animals debating at each other. Tiger and lion candidates. On the other news site there was an anchor that was an anthropomorphic hyena and the weather was presented by an anthropomorphic lynx. Every website or page she opened had similar kind of anthropomorphic animal doing the work what in her own world a human did for a living.<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed a small trend and it made her fur rise. All the anthro-humanoid people were carnivores. Jennifer opened the &#39;Roartube&#39; named website and put on an animal compilation video and only saw herbivores, fish, birds, bugs and similar non-carnivore animals being filmed by carnivores. She typed &#39;Human&#39; on the &#39;Roartube&#39;s&#39; search. Jennifer only saw hour long videos where they explained theories about human and what human would look like if they existed. Jennifer had erased or changed the whole human history as if they never existed. How was that possible? She closed the laptop and had to accept that her &#39;so-called&#39; normal life was now this. Should she go back to the bed a sleep this nightmare away or should she just accept everything and bite the bullet?</p>
