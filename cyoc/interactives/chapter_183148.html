<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Bloodbath II: Summer Camp of Terror,” Mason announced before pretending to wring his own neck and making choking sounds. Janette smiled at him but felt her own body spike with fear. A horror movie? Like where people were killed and scares came out of nowhere. She was petrified by the idea and walked very close to Mason, staring awkwardly at all the movie posters looming down the hall.<br />
<br />
Each one featured the serial killer, bloodstains, or two screaming people with a shadow looming over them. Janette felt like passing out before they even got to the theatre and sat down next to Mason, quivering with fear as the pre-show showed them how blood effects had been made and showed clips from the original. The previews were even worse, terrifying trailers for all manner of currently playing and coming soon thrillers, psychological tormentors, and slasher films. She was quivering in her seat from those alone.<br />
<br />
And then the movie started and she watched as all the victims arrived at camp and trembled in terror as strange things began to happen. Night began to fall and the psycho killer arrived, walking into the showers and opening the curtain before hacking away at the bitchy mean girl in the shower while her screams filled the air, only matched by Janette’s shrill cry of absolute terror. Her hair literally turned white from fright.<br />
<br />
Okay, it was really just a very pale silvery blonde but the change was stark enough to make it look like she’d had white hair grow on her head. She panted in terror, pulled up into her seat and shaking from head to toe.<br />
<br />
Why had she agreed to go to Bloodbath II, the first one had been far too frightening for her tastes when she’d seen it the year prior. She preferred thrillers over slasher films. Especially bleak slasher films.<br />
<br />
Her whimpering continued as the killer found his next victim. The guy was taking a leak in the bathroom when the killer came up behind him and proceeded to cave his head in with the axe.<br />
<br />
The sight of the bloody ooze made Janette pale and her skin didn’t come back down from that tone. She now just had the type of skin that would burn easily in the sunlight and look like the ideal of perfection in a gothic novel from the 1700s.<br />
<br />
She felt a lot less shaken now that her new pale skin tone was set in place. The movie wasn’t that different from her usual tastes. Sure she wasn’t used to this much blood and violence in one place before but there was usually one moment like this she saw in most movies she watched.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the third kill wasn’t that far out of her wheelhouse. The serial killer found the couple having sex in one of the cabins and killed the guy with a swing of his axe while he was fucking her. She shrieked in absolute fear while his decapitated head rolled away and blood sprayed from his neck over her. He then embedded his axe between her breasts and her shrieks fell silent while blood rained off the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
Her clothes changed with that one. Her shirt separated in two. One sleeveless black top over a long sleeved grey shirt. Her pants became tights while a skirt formed over them, and her shoes grew and grew until she was wearing a big heavy pair of boots with elaborate straps running up the sides.<br />
<br />
This film wasn’t that bad, she’d read gorier things on a tame Friday night in. It was actually kind of in her wheelhouse if she was honest. This was the type of movie a guy should take her out to, the pulse pounding kills and suspense were killer and it wasn’t going for any of those lame fake out scares. She was looking forward to the next kill.<br />
<br />
The next guy decided to fight back and stood off against the serial killer. He managed to stab the guy but he kept growing and shoved the dude’s hand into the blender turning it into a bloody pulp that made the entire theatre red. The guy passed out from shock and was then drowned in the overflowing sink while the killer walked out.<br />
<br />
This was when Janette felt her skin crawl with what she thought was interest, disgust, and excitement. This film was really good and starting to get really creative with its violence. Really earning the R instead of chickening out for a PG-13. But that was really her tattoos coming into existence. A couple designs on her arms, a few on her legs, and one on her shoulder that leaked a little onto her right breast. Her ears tingled as piercings multiplied on it and one went through her left eyebrow and one studded her nose.<br />
<br />
With each camper that died she only got more and more invested in the film until she was smiling at all the pulse pounding horror. She loved horror movies after all, and nothing beat a good slasher film on a Friday night, especially the sequel to the first Bloodbath, which had been her favourite film of the previous year. That had been a great homage to classic couples on a lonely road meeting a killer films, just dialling up the gore and leaving a bone chilling “he’s still out there,” finale. Doing a summer camp slasher for the sequel? Perfect.<br />
<br />
The final kill was on the killer himself. Last girl standing, needing to fend him off and finding all the corpses of her friends in the process. It was a doozy too. She snapped. Her eyes went mad and when she disarmed the killer she wailed on him with his axe until there wasn’t a chance he was still alive. She laughed and cried the whole time. A mad slasher smile on her face at the end when she picked up his mask and put it on, wandering away dragging the axe behind her. Oh, it was such a good ending.<br />
<br />
Her makeup darkened, eyeshadow becoming thicker until she had a hot spooky look to her face with black lipstick that popped against her pale blonde hair and porcelain skin.<br />
<br />
She’d been a fan of old slasher films all her life. Used to watch them with her dad on an old black and white projector in the basement. The Bloodbath series was a huge homage to those just without violence discretion shots. She was so into it, Mason had just picked the best movie he could have to win her over. If he was down to watch an old black and white film on a projector that was beaming the movie onto an old bedsheet in the backyard, she might’ve just found the guy she was after her whole life.<br />
<br />
“So, what’d ya think?” Mason asked with a turn towards her. His eyes widened as she smiled back at him.<br />
<br />
Janette had been replaced with a hot spooky looking chick. She had very pale skin, long silvery blonde, and dark makeup that contrasted them. She was wearing a sleeveless top over a grey long sleeved one that had an old B monster movie poster splayed over it, and she had a couple tattoos peering from the bottoms of her sleeves and pitch black nail polish. His dick tented his pants the second he saw her.<br />
<br />
“You got good taste,” the girl that Janette had turned into smiled while leaning towards him. “You got time tomorrow night for a old monster movie in my dad’s back yard? He’s got all sorts of old film reels.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure!” Mason exclaimed. Any excuse to be with this girl was good for him. She then kissed him on the cheek and said it was a date. Anyone that saw him leaving probably thought he’d been a romance film judging by how pink his face was.</p>
