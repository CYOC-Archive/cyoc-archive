<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unaware to Max, sitting on a bus on his way to Tim’s, is a boy named Ricardo “Rick” Alverez. The 13-year-old, who is Mexican, is the leader of a group of kids at Max’s and Tim’s school who are known to bully and harass other kids. Rick has an athletic body, light brown skin, brown eyes and short brown hair.<br />
<br />
Tim hadn’t invited Rick to the costume party, however, Rick has just discovered the app version of the Chronivac and when he remembered overhearing Tim talk about the costume party, the bully decided to invite himself and have some… “fun” with the kids at the party.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… I can’t wait to try the app out on those nerds and losers,” the boy mutters to himself, grinning, “this is gonna be fun… at least for me… hehe!”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Max arrives at Tim’s house, the 10-year-old knocks on the door which soon opens and he is greeted by the wide eyed face of his friend Tim, “hehe… heya, Tim,” Max says, “so, what do you think of my costume?”<br />
<br />
“Holy crap, Max,” Tim says, “that costume looks amazing! Where in the world did you get it?”<br />
<br />
“Funny thing,” Max says, “I found it lying in the kitchen of my home. Don’t ask me how it got there, because I have no clue! Hey… at least I have a cool costume, right?”<br />
<br />
Tim nods, “the coolest I’ve ever seen,” he says before stepping aside, “come on in, the others are all in the living room. They’ll be amazed!”<br />
<br />
For the next hour, Max is stared at and touched by everyone, until they all calmed down and decide to play some video games.<br />
<br />
Apart from Max and Tim, who is a year older than Max, and wearing a pirate costume, there are four other children present:<br />
<br />
Kyle, an 11-year-old boy with blue eyes and short blond hair who has a slime and almost feminine figure and who is wearing a Superman costume.<br />
<br />
Amy, a 12-year-old girl with long black hair, green eyes, a beautiful hourglass figure, 32B breasts and who is wearing a witch’s costume.<br />
<br />
Donna, an 11-year-old girl, also with a beautiful hourglass figure, shoulder length brown hair, brown eyes and who is wearing a pony onsie.<br />
<br />
And Arthur, a 12-year-old boy with an athletic figure, brown eyes, short black hair and wearing a full body lizard costume, but not as cool or detailed as Max’s “costume”.<br />
<br />
The six boys are oblivious to the danger approaching with Rick just arriving at Tim’s house, the 13-year-old stopping in front of the house, grinning up at it before looking down at his phone, “let the fun begin,” he says to himself as he opens the app and types in a command: “Rick rules”, allowing the 13-year-old to manipulate anyone and anything, including the reality, by simply speaking commands out loud or by selecting a scanned target and typing a command into an individual command field withing that scanned target’s file.<br />
<br />
Once Rick had entered the command, the young teen puts his phone away, “let’s see if this works,” he then says, “when I knock on the door, Tim will open it and ask me to come in. Tim and the others will be confused to why I am here, however, they will listen to my reason and accept it,” the boy grins when he feels the atmosphere tingle.<br />
<br />
Rick approaches the door to Tim’s house and knocks, he then hears footsteps approach and the door open, “Rick? What are you doing here,” Tim asks, sounding and looking confused, “you weren’t invited, but please… since you are here: I guess you may come in”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “thanks, Tim,” he says, stepping into the house, “I’ll explain my reason for coming when you have lead me to the others”.<br />
<br />
“Alright… follow me,” Tim says, leading Rick into the living room.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is HE doing here,” the others ask, frowning when they see Rick.<br />
<br />
Tim shrugs, “I don’t know, but he said he’ll explain it to us,” everyone then looks at Rick, “well… tell us why you are here, Rick,” Tim then says.<br />
<br />
“I know I haven’t been so nice to you in the past,” Rick says, “I have decided to change, I came here to not bully or be in anyway mean to you guys. I came to offer you my help”.<br />
<br />
The six kids blink in confusion, “help,” they ask.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, smiling, “I want to help you guys to find your true purpose,” he says, “I want to help you unravel your full potential”.<br />
<br />
The others look at each other, “that… doesn’t sound to bad,” Max says.<br />
<br />
Donna nods, “yeah… I’d be happy to have some help unraveling my full potential,” the others nod.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Rick,” Tim says, as they all turn to the 13-year-old, “so, what potentials do we have and how will you help us to unravel them?”<br />
<br />
Rick smiles wide, “let’s start with you, Tim,” he says, tilting his head, he then smiles, “tell me, Tim. What is it you enjoy the most?”<br />
<br />
Tim tilts his head, “well, I enjoy being admired and the center of attention,” the 11-year-old says.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles wide, “then I know exactly what your true purpose is,” he says, “a mannequin!”<br />
<br />
Tim blinks in confusion, “a mannequin,” he asks, looking at his friends who just shrug.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “mannequins are always the center of attention and always get admired,” he says, “their purpose is to show off the coolest and newest outfits on the market, so they are very important. Just think about it: you’d be admired and be the center of attention all day long!”<br />
<br />
Tim thinks about Rick’s words, the more he does the more it makes sense to the 11-year-old, a small smile appears on his face.<br />
<br />
Rick smirks, “I can help you look the part,” he says, “all you have to do is do exactly what I say”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Tim says, sounding excited, “what do you need me to do?”<br />
<br />
“Well, since mannequins don’t move and don’t speak,” Rick says, “I want you to not say a word, and stand absolutely still”.<br />
<br />
At his words, Tim goes rigid, standing absolutely straight and closes his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Good, now,” Rick turns to the others, “I don’t think the outfit the mannequin is wearing is cool enough. Would one of you help me take is off?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll help,” Arthur says and together they start to undress the 11-year-old, who doesn’t seem to mind, after all: he is just a mannequin, and soon the 11-year-old is completely naked.<br />
<br />
Rick rubs his hands as he stares at the naked 11-year-old, the 13-year-old grins, “now, mannequins have no genitals,” he says, “so your genitals will shrink back into your body, leaving behind nothing but smooth skin”.<br />
<br />
Tim just stands in silence with a neutral expression on his face and with no reaction as the others gasp and stare in a mix of shock and fascination as they watch Tim’s boy-parts simply shrink back into the 11-year-old’s body, leaving behind nothing but smooth skin.<br />
<br />
“H-how… how are you doing this, Rick,” Arthur asks.<br />
<br />
Max frowns, staring at Rick, ‘he must have a Chronivac too, but… that makes no sense,’ he thinks to himself, unaware of the app-version of the program. Since Rick made the previous command, that whatever he says will be accepted by the group, the thought of trying to stop Rick doesn’t cross Max’s mind.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “that, Arthur, will stay my little secret,” he says, then addressing Tim he adds, “mannequins have happy expressions, so I want you to give us a nice smile”. Instantly Tim’s mouth curls into a small but happy smile, “good mannequin,” Rick says, “now, to prevent you from falling over, you’ll need a nice solid base with a metal bar that is attached to the back of your leg, which can be easily popped off to make it easier to dress you”.<br />
<br />
Again Tim doesn’t flinch, he just stands there in silence and with a smile on his face as a metal seems to ooze out of his right leg and spread under his feet creating a solid base.<br />
<br />
“Good, now, mannequins don’t have skin, they are made of solid resin,” Rick says, “your head, arms and torso are detachable, your eyes are made of glass and your hair is made of synthetic fibers. Also mannequins have no organs, so all of your organs will vanish”.<br />
<br />
The others watch as the texture of Tim’s skin changes and seams appear, soon a normal mannequin is standing before them.<br />
<br />
“So, what now,” Max asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, the mannequin doesn’t belong in a family home,” Rick says, smirking, “so, I think the best place for it will be a clothing store, where it will get all the attention it deserves,” and with a crack, the new minted mannequin vanishes.<br />
<br />
“That was so cool,” Arthur says, “and Tim looked so happy to finally have found his true purpose!”<br />
<br />
“Well, that is what I promised to do after all,” Rick says, “now, who want to go next? If no one volunteers then I’ll pick randomly who to help”.</p>
