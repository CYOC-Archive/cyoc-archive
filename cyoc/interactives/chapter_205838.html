<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin Wilson was a pretty average older teen- a bit chubby, though not overweight or anything, and fairly average height with a bit of an emo taste. He had just turned 18 and gone away to college, so no surprise he got drawn in by the allure of the nightclub on one of the backstreets of the city he had moved to. <br />
While he had seen girls in fairly revealing clothing enter and been drawn in by that, once he came to the door seeing the handsome guy guarding the door to the club made him even more excited to go into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enter, changing to someone completely new and experience the best night of your life. Or leave,&quot; said the man.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to enter, please,&quot; Kevin said a little shakily, his cock hardening a little from the sultry voice he&#39;d just heard. The man smiled and let him in, and Kevin strode inside.<br />
There, he saw a cavalcade of people dancing under a kaleidoscope of party lights, most of whom were also dressed either casually, revealingly, or both. He soon caught the eye of a cute girl who gestured for him to come dance with her, and his heart raced as she led him in a dorky routine of arm-flailing and swaying. Clearly she wasn&#39;t any better a dancer than him, but they were both enjoying it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you should dance with my friend!&quot; she offered, yelling it into his ear in what passes for a whisper in loud clubs like these.<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Kevin agreed, and she showed him to the cutest guy he&#39;d ever seen in his life. His soft fluffy hair, cute smile, angled cheeks and toned physique made Kevin just as turned on as the girl had, much to his surprise. The young man was a much better dancer than his companion, and he led Kevin through a much more graceful set of steps, concluding it by cupping Kevin&#39;s cheeks and smiling knowingly. The two boys kissed eagerly, and Kevin felt an erection brush against his own.<br />
<br />
Once their kiss broke, Kevin felt the girl&#39;s hand grip his own. &quot;You want a bit of space?&quot; she offered. &quot;I&#39;m going to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kevin mumbled, kinda still shaken, though in a good way. &quot;Oh yeah, what&#39;s your name?&quot; he asked as they approached the bathrooms.<br />
&quot;Ollie,&quot; the girl replied. While at the back of his mind Kevin felt like that was a very boyish name, Ollie seemed friendly, so he went with her without hesitation.<br />
<br />
To Kevin&#39;s surprise, they both went into a gender-neutral bathroom instead of different gendered ones, and even more to his surprise, she led him into a cubicle, which she locked behind them. &quot;I feel like you&#39;re like me,&quot; she said, giving him a passionate kiss. Kevin kissed back, his newfound bisexuality seeming like something he&#39;d always had.<br />
&quot;Like you?&quot; Kevin asked once their kiss finished.<br />
&quot;Outside this place, everyone thinks I&#39;m a straight boy. But I&#39;m not straight or a boy,&quot; Ollie explained. &quot;I can tell you&#39;re enjoying not being straight, so how about I show you how to not be a boy?&quot;<br />
Kevin surprised himself with his answer. &quot;Um... please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie smiled eagerly. &quot;OK, let&#39;s do this. First, take off your boy&#39;s clothes.&quot; She helped him, pulling off his shirt, undoing his jeans and helping him remove his underwear. She even insisted he take off his shoes and socks, and soon he stood naked as the day he was born in the cubicle.<br />
&quot;Next,&quot; Ollie said, licking her lips, &quot;you need to have someone suck the manhood out of you.&quot; She got down in front of him, took his erection in her hand and began to suck him off. Kevin moaned as her mouth wrapped round his cock, and she sucked eagerly, making his body feel weird all over. He didn&#39;t even notice how he had already started to change, his skin softening and soft curves emerging around his figure. The only thing he did notice was how warm his chest felt all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
Kevin made an unusually high-pitched groan as he came, hard, inside Ollie&#39;s mouth. He felt like he had just shot every drop of his seed between her lips, and soon his shaft felt like it was receding, getting licked away like an ice cream between Ollie&#39;s lips.<br />
She stood up and kissed him eagerly, and he responded by returning the kiss and allowing her to spread the cum in her mouth into Kevin&#39;s, making him taste himself. The taste felt so foreign, not merely because he&#39;d never tasted semen but because it felt like something that was not a part of him, even though it had been. &quot;You taste good,&quot; Ollie assured him. &quot;And now you&#39;ve had the manhood sucked out of you, it&#39;s time you stopped being a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her statement felt more like an affirmation than a threat to Kevin, and as she touched him all over and his body remoulded under her hands like clay, he ached with pleasure and unfamiliar arousal. Her hands rubbed and pinched his nipples until they were the size of a girl&#39;s, and soon she was stroking the skin around them and mounds of soft supple flesh formed under her touch. &quot;You&#39;ve got really nice tits,&quot; Ollie said, and Kevin felt proud. He did have nice tits, and he loved them.<br />
Finally her hand reached between his legs and cupped what hung between them. &quot;You know what this is, right?&quot; she asked. He nodded, and she explained anyway. &quot;This is your scrotum. I just need to turn it into your vagina, and you&#39;ll be a girl!&quot; Her hand pressed against it, and Kevin felt his body yield to it. He yielded and yielded until he couldn&#39;t yield any further, and then Ollie&#39;s fingers pressed further. Now she yielded, and realised she was a girl now.  She moistened around the fingers inside her pussy, and felt her arousal shoot higher and higher as Ollie rubbed what was once his penis with her thumb, realising that it had turned into her clitoris.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Ollie whispered in her ear. &quot;Cum for me, you good girl.&quot; Kevin came hard against her fingers, and moaned eagerly while clinging to the girl playing with her pussy.<br />
Once she came down from the high, Ollie helped her dress again- now her clothes were a black low-cut dress, black knee-high socks and black low heels- and led her out of the bathroom to find more people to get with.</p>
