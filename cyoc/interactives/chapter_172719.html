<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Grace felt that keeping it to herself, despite the fact that she would be hinding it from her beloved Master was best for him in the end. And only because of that, was she able to convince herself it was the right choice. <br />
<br />
A half hour later, Master was just sitting on his chair grading papers as she stood off to the side behind him, as instructed. She didn&#39;t move an inch, and was controlling ber breathing so as to not make any sudden movenents. Master had instructed her to pretend to be a stature, so now that was exactly what she was doing. She couldn&#39;t tell what was happening around her since her eyes were closed, but she could hear the hushed murmurs her master as he grumbled to himself. <br />
<br />
2 more hours passed like this, and finally Master had finnished his work, letting out a sigh. &quot;Your former classmates are all idiots you know, Grace? Well I guess before you suddenly grew up into a beautiful woman my age, you were one too. No idea how that happened but I cant say that I am complaining. Anyways, lets get going to our home. Actuallly, scratch that. Lets head to a sex shop first. I think you should have a more proper outfit for your new position as my exclusive milk maid wife. Well, let&#39;s get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace open her eyes and nod, being careful not to cause more milk to leak out. Her breasts already were filled back up to their K cup size with more milk. Even though they were extremely heavy, due to her not having arms, her body still felt relatively light. It seemed as if her body was made perfectly with carrying them in mind as her back, shoulders, and other various muscles had all become strong enough to support her breasts without any kind of pain or difficulty whatsoever. <br />
<br />
As she walked behind her Master, Grace could feel how naturally her body walked in her heels. It was as if she had never worn anything else. Her ass swayed in an exaggerated manner too, only serving to highten her sex appeal. However, her breasts remained perfectly level, as well as the rest of her upper torso. Always maintaining a proper posture had been carved deep into this body&#39;s habits and mannerism.<br />
<br />
The walk to Master&#39;s car was completely silent. Only thw clicking of her heels could be heard comming from the two of them. Master opened up his passenger side door, and helped her get in and buckled, before he got into the driver&#39;s seat. The moment he closed the door he looked over at her. &quot;Alright this has to stop. Grace, you are my milk maid, my property, and my entertainment. But you also are my fiancee, and future wife. I don&#39;t want to be the only human being in this relationship, so you can act like a normal person too. In other words, unless I order you to, you do not need my permission to do things. You can speak freely from now on ok. This silent treatment is just super awkward for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize Master, I didn&#39;t mean to offend you or make you feel awkward. I will try and be a better milk maid wife in the future. Grace said in a panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;No no no. What are you apologizing for? What did you do wrong? You were just doing what you felt was appropriate correct? So how could I be made at that?&quot; Her Master leaned over and kissed Grace&#39;s cheek and left boob, being careful not to cause another overflow. <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, Master. Would it be alright for me to know what you intend to buy perhapse?&quot; said Grace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still to formal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me Master. What are you goning to buy from the sex shop? Anything super kinky perhapse?  Maybe a butt plug? Or maybe something like a toy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was perfect. And yep, I intend to buy something kinky for you alright. And it does include a butt plug. Basically I know of this milk maid costume. It is basically a french maid style uniform, except with a boob tray like your corset has. It comes with a special anal plug which has a cow tail fixed to it. Also there is a headband with fake, but realistic looking cow ears and horns. Lastly there is a set of heels that have a split closed toe, kinda like hooves. I was thinking of getting then for you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing Master&#39;s plan&#39;s had made Grace wet once again, as she imagined how she would look, and if it was anything even remotely close to what she thought, then she would be super sexy.  &quot;Can I get a cow bell too, Master?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, and I was also thinking about a set of nipple ring clamps to stop your leaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I can&#39;t wait Master. I am sure it will look amazing. And I can&#39;t wait to wear it for you every day like it is my skin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, again, no need to go that far. I want a clear distinction between sexy time and just normal, everyday life for us, honey.&quot; Being called&quot;honey&quot; made Grace blush even more. &quot;I dont know how normal I can be. I only know how to be a milk maid.&quot; This was a first for Grace. Her body suddenly began speaking as if on auto pilot as new information and memories began to flood her mind. <br />
<br />
She was born in a secret facility where her father had decided that she would become a milk maid, just like her mother. And as such, she never had arms as they had been removed at birth since no milk maid could have arm. This was because if they did, then they would not need to be milked and taken care of by others. Their lifestyle was to be one of complete dependence and submission afterall. She didn&#39;t even know what having arms felt like anymore as her old memories began to fade slightly. She even had forgotten her old name. Her memories only contained ones where she was called Grace. The only 2 things that remained were that she remembered not always being Grace. But not what she was before. The other was that she could change her body at will to meet the desires of her loving Master.</p>
