<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shaking her head slightly, Jenny hung up the phone. It was odd - she knew she&#39;d just been speaking to someone on it, but for the life of her, she couldn&#39;t remember who it was or what they&#39;d talked about. Frowning, she looked at the phone for a moment before shrugging - maybe the call had just been so boring she&#39;d completely tuned it out like some kind of defense mechanism. That was a thing, right? She was sure she&#39;d read something about that. <br />
<br />
Well, either way, she had to get going to catch the bus in time for school.<br />
<br />
She gathered her things and cheerfully walked to the bus stop. On the bus, she joined her friend and fellow cheerleader Alba. Alba was one of Jennifer&#39;s girl crushes - she had a beautiful smile, amazing skin, and was just fun to be around. There&#39;d been a few parties where Jenny had deliberately spun the bottle so it would land on Alba; no one ever seemed to mind. Not the boys, not even the other girls, and not Alba. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jen,&quot; Alba said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeey,&quot; Jenny said, sliding into the seat. <br />
<br />
They talked about some inconsequential things, gossiping about a few people at school. At one point Alba reached out and brushed Jen&#39;s hair - Jen smiled, but it was somewhat strained when Alba&#39;s hand came away holding a leaf. &quot;Huh, guess it fell on my head on the way to the bus stop,&quot; Jenny said. &quot;You know, we should do a fundraiser or something. Something to protect the trees, and promote more forest growth. I think...I think it&#39;s important.&quot; She frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Alba said. &quot;Okay? Sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny barely responded. Where had that even come from? <br />
<br />
They rode the rest of the way in silence. <br />
<br />
Jenny waved goodbye to Alba and proceeded to her first class of the day - Biology. She walked over to her usual station and set down her backpack.<br />
<br />
And then things got weird.<br />
<br />
Against her will, she began to strip. It happened so quickly, so casually, that she barely understood what was happening until she was standing there in only her bra and panties. &quot;Wait, what the fuck am I doing?&quot; she wondered, as her arms ignored her mental commands to yank down her panties and undo her bra. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, casual as one could be, Jenny felt herself walk to the front of the class, where she picked up one of the bags that contained some bits of tree matter - roots in this case, from some of the local trees in the area that they had cleaned up as part of a lab the previous week. She took the bag and proceeded to walk over to one of the empty planters they kept in the class. One of their projects for later in the year was going to be planting a few trees around campus. She stepped up onto the planter and put her legs into the plastic bag with the roots, and then, with some effort, managed to wedge her feet into the soil of the planter. All the while she was cursing and trying to call for help, but everyone in the class was ignoring her. And she wasn&#39;t the sort of girl who was used to being ignored. Her double dee chest was bouncing and heaving with the exertion, and yet not a single guy or even any of the girls were paying her any attention. <br />
<br />
When her feet were secured into the planter, she put her arms off to the side and slightly raised.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on right now?!&quot; she demanded. No one answered.<br />
<br />
A peculiar sensation started in her feet. It felt like...like her toes were itching, or...growing? It was hard to describe. She looked down and gasped with horror - something brown and hard was spreading up her legs...it looked like...like bark! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; she shouted. &quot;NO! What the fuck?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bark continued up her legs, and when it reached her knees, she felt her legs suddenly press together with sudden force. Her cries went ignored as her legs joined together, becoming a solitary trunk buried in the soil of the planter. &quot;No, no, noooo! What the fuck! Am I turning into a tree?! What the fuck!&quot; She could feel her feet - her toes - her roots, she supposed - digging further into the soil, ensuring she was kept firmly in place. The bark proceeded up her body, covering the rest of her legs and leaving a trunk where her beautiful legs had once been. &quot;How am I supposed to get around with a fucking trunk?! I can&#39;t do cheerleading as a tree!&quot; she shouted. She tried to struggle and free herself, but it was pointless - there were no binds to struggle against. In this case, the binding was her own body. The bark continued up her belly, covering most of her waist in bark, and all of her back. However, when it reached her chest, it seemed to skip over it - though her breasts had a bit of a bark like pattern to them, they were just as bouncy and fleshy as they had been prior to the change. &quot;Ugh, of course!&quot; she grumbled. Then she gasped as the bark proceeded up her arms, causing her fingers to splinter off and become various leafy branches. <br />
<br />
In only a few minutes, Jenny had been transformed into a living tree girl - and still no one was paying her any attention!</p>
