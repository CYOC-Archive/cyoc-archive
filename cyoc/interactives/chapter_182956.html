<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite his impaired nature most dangerous things still gave him a wide berth. Or maybe they were just scared of what could do to them in this state. Regardless, Alec was left alone with his thoughts as he struggled to head back.<br />
Despite his best efforts, his hind legs kept rubbing his bloated testicles. Any tiny sprout of leaf of grass he passed over tickled his dangling sack. Yet he kept going until it became to much. He exploded over the landscape, his balls churned and streams of hot white liquid shot from his fat cock. Splattering on the road.<br />
<br />
It was deep in the night when he felt he couldn&#39;t go on any longer. He sought out a cluster of bushes and hid himself between them. Gently lowering himself in a sleeping position that didn&#39;t stimulate his impossible balls.<br />
Dreams of emptying his balls in whatever hole he could find visited him through the night.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know exactly how long he&#39;d slept when he awoke in a sticky mess. He estimated it must be very early morning. Somewhere before 6? Maybe? Why didn&#39;t these people invent clocks, or maybe they had and he just hadn&#39;t found them yet.<br />
Well at least he wasn&#39;t mugged and to his delight he found his balls had shrunk further. No longer were they just barely clearing the ground, yet still plenty large to reach down to his knees.<br />
He got up and cleaned himself as best he could. How the hell did centaurs even do that? His arms couldn&#39;t even reach most of his body. They probably don&#39;t have to wipe their ass. This world must be getting to him, because he briefly caught himself wondering what would happen if a lady centaur&#39;s hole was filled by a dildo or like object. She couldn&#39;t reach it right?<br />
He wondered if he could find out about that, before resuming his trip. He still had to keep his hind legs further apart than normal, but his awkward waddle from yesterday was a lot faster now. But he couldn&#39;t get his dick to stay inside it&#39;s sheath unless he wanted to take a week to get home. With trial and error he found a speed where he could keep going, but not have to stop to explode onto the side of the road anymore.<br />
<br />
He reached the walls of the city in the early morning and despite the mix of disgusted and questioning looks from both guards and other travelers Alec still made it into the city.<br />
He clumsily entered the mage guild. The receptionist eyed him suspiciously.<br />
&quot;Wow, you weren&#39;t happy with what you already had?&quot;<br />
A tiny, yet familiar voice came from behind him. He shuffled his horse&#39;s ass to the side so he could see a girl. Probably around her teens, dressed in ill fitting armor with her arms crossed looking up at him sternly.<br />
&quot;You look slightly taller.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, was it worth leaving us behind?&quot;<br />
Alec showed the pouch. &quot;Where&#39;s Andrea?&quot;<br />
&quot;She went to the guild to report back and apparently she&#39;s also checking something out. So what the hell happened to you this time?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you all about it, but can we go get my body back? Being a centaur is pretty awesome, but not right now.&quot; He was sure he felt something squirt out of him.<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
To his relief his own body had lost it&#39;s breasts. He assumed the pussy was still there, but he only needed one more ingredient for that. They hoisted his body up on his horse back, followed by Vivian jumping on.<br />
Following her directions they made they way to the guard house as Alec told most of the story of what had happened. Leaving some of the parts he was less proud of out of his retelling.<br />
&quot;You met Tanookimans? Amazing. They&#39;re pretty rare. I do hope you learned your lesson from this.&quot;<br />
&quot;I learned not to mess with guys with bigger balls then mine?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I mean leaving your team behind. You were lucky that Tanookimans are at worst mischievous, but never malicious. You have a habit of getting into trouble. Don&#39;t rush off without a plan Alec.&quot;<br />
&quot;I always get out of trouble as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious. Be more careful.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine. I&#39;m sorry. I really am. But I just really want my...equipment back. And this body was a great opportunity. And it&#39;s not like you&#39;re anywhere near back to full power.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m strong enough to kick your inexperienced ass even now.&quot;<br />
While their current stature differences made this statement pretty funny, the edge in her tone and the thought of actually getting his ass kicked by a teen girl in the middle of a busy street made him reconsider making fun of that remark.<br />
<br />
The guards office was a heavily reinforced building. It&#39;s barred windows dotted walls with protective shutters swung to the sides. It&#39;s dark grey walls gave the impression that not even a canon could breach them. The large open doors were flanked by two guards also wielding pikes. <br />
Groups of guards came in and out of the building at regular intervals as they approached it. Alec identified himself to one of the guards and was allowed in.<br />
&quot;You know, I am going to miss my free horse rides.&quot;<br />
&quot;What is it with girls and riding horses?&quot;<br />
She shrugged. &quot;We just like big things between our legs I guess. You know that feeling right?&quot;<br />
The inside of the building was crowded, noisy and messy. A near polar opposite to the large and spacey mage guild.  Alec soon felt cramped. This large body wasn&#39;t meant to be navigating these narrow and crowded halls.<br />
Alec once again identified himself to a receptionist. A squirely man who was safely inside his own little prison behind glass. Were they expecting an attack on the station or something? This all seemed overkill considering the outside walls.<br />
<br />
It took only a few minutes before a large guard came to get him. A large star shaped badge shone on his chest. His eyes stern and sharp. He looked liked he&#39;d seen it all and had believed none of it. Behind him two other guards followed nervously.<br />
They led him through a door and out into an open area surrounded by walls.  The inner area must be mostly used for lunch breaks. A few guards were seated at a picknick table talking amongst themselves. The guard house must be bigger than he thought if all these walls belonged to it.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been told you need to switch back to your own body? I had my trouble believing it, but seeing the infamous Alem walk in here out of free will....and carrying a little girl on his back. I can&#39;t help but be curious about this.&quot;<br />
They set down Alec&#39;s body.</p>
