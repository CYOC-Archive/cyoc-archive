<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark said, &quot;Hey would you like to volunteer for something? I&#39;d like to try out something.&quot; Ken looked at him, &quot;Like what?&quot;. His roommate smiled at him, &quot;Well you&#39;ve seen what I can do, and I&#39;d rather have you volunteer that doing it while you&#39;re sleeping... though it&#39;s more fun if you don&#39;t know what it is right away.&quot; &quot;A..Alright&quot;, Ken agreed somewhat hesitantly as this does sound better than waking up as a raccoon or something. &quot;Now could you please strip&quot;, said Matt. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Well it&#39;s called body-sculpting, can&#39;t sculpt your clothes, but don&#39;t worry I will give you something better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken stripped and stood in front of Matt who was looking at him from different perspectives. &quot;Ohh this will be good, just relax&quot;, he said as the pushed down Ken&#39;s shoulders. They gave way like modeling clay and his torso and legs became chubbier. Mark slid the side of his hand down Ken&#39;s chest pushing a blunt flesh colored mass of material down to his crotch where it joined his member which was clearly erect at this point. What&#39;s left behind is a fairly smooth and featureless surface. Then he takes a little wodden spatula and cuts a neckline around Ken&#39;s neck before pulling off some material to make its proportions more normal. The cut makes it look like Ken was wearing some sort of thick coat. Mark makes another one of those cuts at Ken&#39;s shoulders, leaving a sort of shoulder pads over the now less bloated arms. With the thin end of the spatula he made a decorative ring inwards from the rim of the pad. &quot;Now could you please raise your arms&quot;, Mark asked Ken who did so. The whole process felt odd, but not to unpleasant so far, perhaps a bit like a massage.  Mark meanwhile cut around Ken&#39;s armpits and sculpted his arms some more so they looked somewhat muscular again. Then he focused his attention at Ken&#39;s hands. He pushed some of the material of Ken&#39;s lower arms forming a conical funnel. After that he rubbed his fingers making them more smooth, hairless and devoid of fingernails, just like gloves.<br />
Mark then focused on the torso again. He made a cut at the lower chest and removed some of the material below, creating a sort of pad around Ken&#39;s chest going all around his body. With his fingers he formed it into a smooth form with a decorative kink at its front. Going further down, he cut around Ken&#39;s bum and crotch area similarly forming a shield around the lower part of his body. However within it there was Ken&#39;s crotch and penis still visible. Mark, with both hands, grabbed the whole area and pulled it out. Ken protested &quot;Hey!&quot;, but Mark was already at work pluging the hole that was left. <br />
He then went to work on Ken&#39;s feet. Similarly to the his arms he formed a conical shaft around his lower legs. He pushed his toes together and massaged them into a smooth shape each. With the narrow end of his spatula he drew around the soles before pulling each leg up for a moment, drawing intricate patterns on their otherwise flat soles.<br />
Then he took some of the left-over material and formed it into a long tube. He stepped behind Mark and attached it to his spine pointing downwards in a bow. Gently he made it thinner at the end and added some rings around it. As he finished Ken near instantly started to wag it idly, starting to realize that it was part of his body.<br />
Mark then stepped in front of his roommate again. He used both hands to form his hair into a slightly more spikeier form. He pulled on Ken&#39;s ears to make them larger, smoother and more pointed at the ends. He then drew a ring from the hairline behind one of the ears over his forehead to the hairline below and behind the other ear. With a bit of extra material he formed small cylinder stubs, placing them on the band he just created. He then pulled around the eye sockets, making Ken&#39;s eyes considerably larger. He also pulled on his nose and mouth, making them protrude further forward before re-shaping his nose into an oblong spheroid.<br />
Mark then took some of the leftover mass and formed a pair of tubes roughly a hand span in diameter, closed on top and open on the bottom. He affixed them to Ken&#39;s back adding some details to make them look like rocket engines with the nozzles pointing downward.<br />
He then took the mass that previously was Ken&#39;s balls and cock and rolled it into a long form before flattening it along most of it&#39;s length to turn it into a sword blade. He shaped the other part into a handle for it.<br />
Eventually Ken looked like a clay sculpture of an opossum wearing a suit of armor with a rocket pack on the end. However it was all in Ken&#39;s skin tone. Ken looked around trying to get a better view of himself, as Mark was getting some paints.<br />
<br />
Mark took a brush and some red paint and started to paint it over the armor pieces leaving a nice and shiny surface behind. He also applied said paint to the gloves and boots. Then he took some gold paint and painted the rims of those pieces of armour, as well as the cylinders that were destined to become goggles. Some orange paint was applied to basically color the rocket pack. The pieces of left over skin below his armor as well as the strip of the googgles were painted in a brown color. While the armor pieces seemed to change into metal as they dried, those new brown pieces seemed to change into thick leather. He applied silver and gold paint to his sword, effectively turning it into a real one. Then he took some beige color which appeared to have little specs inside of it and put a thick layer of it onto Ken&#39;s face and neck. He applied less of it to the back of his ears and his tails. As it dried it left behind a more or less pronounced coat of fur. After a round of finishing touches Mark declared his creation finished. &quot;Here we go&quot;, he said before opening the door of a cabinet to reveal a full length mirror.<br />
<br />
Ken was now only about half of his original height, though a lot more bulked up. At least in part this was because of his armor.  He turned around and looked at his back in the mirror, &quot;Do these work?&quot; while pointing at the rocket pack. &quot;They should&quot;, replied Mark, &quot;Why don&#39;t you try them out&quot;. Ken having been gradually become aware of their existence just turned them on. It was like moving a muscle he previously didn&#39;t know he had, and as they spun up a surge of power rushed through him like an orgasm. Moments later a blast of hot air shot him up in the air. However in a natural instinct he could control it natively making him hover as a comfortable height. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s cool&quot;, he said before landing again. He experimentally tried to pull off his left glove, but found that it seemed to be stuck. Mark explained, &quot;Well you are now a mixture of man and machine, and magical beeing... well perhaps not man, but more of an opossum, but you get the gist. It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve been dabbling in recently&quot;. &quot;So if that armor and the pants don&#39;t come off...&quot;, reasoned Ken, &quot;What if I need to do number one or two&quot; Mark grinned, &quot;Well I&#39;ve though about that, your output will be converted to fuel for your engine.&quot;</p>
