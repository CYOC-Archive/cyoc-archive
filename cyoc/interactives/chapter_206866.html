<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What I really want is to have you masturbate me like you would a stallion.&quot; Mike wondered if that would shock the kid, but the boy just grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; The stable-boy shut Conner&#39;s gate and shouted over to another boy. &quot;Hey, bring me some stallion cream.&quot; He patted Mike&#39;s side. &quot;I&#39;ll get you cleaned up, too. Most male horse...centaurs have a lot of old smegma.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smegma? What was that? Mike was surprised when Liam squatted down right there in the main stable and started slipping his fingers into Mike&#39;s heavy sheath. Well, if that was normal here, Mike sure didn&#39;t mind showing off his Clyde-sized package.<br />
<br />
The other boy, a scruffy, dark-haired kid a year or two younger than the one handling Mike, came over with a large clay jar. He looked Mike over as Liam took the jar and scooped a handful out. &quot;Nice! Good conformation for the most part, powerful. With a little adjustment, you could be a champion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Liam grinned. &quot;If he was just a couple years younger. And we fixed the conformation problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Conformation problems?&quot; Mike twisted around to look at himself. As far as he could tell, he was just about perfect, but he didn&#39;t really know horses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing serious. They are really obvious to us &#39;cause we fix stuff like this all the time. We can take care of the problems for you. On the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Free? Hey, I&#39;m all for that. Make me perfect.&quot; Mike grinned and then gasped as Liam grabbed his emerging cock with the goop-filled hand and slowly slid it back and forth. The creme was warm, and he started to stiffen quickly.<br />
<br />
Liam chuckled and nodded to the other boy. &quot;You heard him, Aaron. Let&#39;s make him perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike shivered as Liam&#39;s hand slid down his horse-cock. The warm creme was getting him aroused, and there was an awful lot of him to get hard. Meanwhile, the other boy started grooming Mike&#39;s equine parts with brushes. it was the most sensual experience of Mike&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
Climax came disappointingly fast, but Mike gasped when the massive load shot out. Liam kept masturbating him, and amazingly, he did not soften. The boy chuckled when Mike looked around. &quot;That was your first time coming as a stallion. We&#39;re just getting started!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike blinked. &quot;How did you know it was my first time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam looked at him oddly, still sliding his slick hand back and forth. &quot;Huh? You mean you never came as a centaur...?&quot; He grinned. &quot;Hey, Aaron! This guy is a new centaur! Aren&#39;t you?&quot; Liam chuckled. &quot;You were human before this, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike flushed and nodded. &quot;Uh, yeah. It&#39;s all new to me. I never experienced magic before today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;ll get to feel lots of it today!&quot; Liam was bringing him to another, powerful climax. &quot;I promise you that when we are done, you are going to be absolutely perfect, and totally content.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike started to ask what he meant, but then shuddered as a second ejaculation splattered the stable floor. He felt the surge of pleasure with his whole body this time.<br />
<br />
Liam grinned and kept up the masturbation. &quot;Pretty nice way to get rid of imperfections, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mike was feeling a little dazed from the sexual sensations.<br />
<br />
&quot;The things wrong with you. We&#39;re turning them into cum. Every time you shoot your wad, your balls refill by changing your flaws into more spunk. We can go on like this for hours!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stared at the boys open-mouthed. &quot;You gotta be kidding! You can make me perfect by beating me off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron held up a brush. &quot;And some other work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike realized his hide was much improved - sleek and glowing like gold. His horse parts really did look better. &quot;Don&#39;t forget my head and chest. I want to be as handsome as my horse parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam grinned as Mike shivered and stiffened for a third time under his expert handling. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Every part of you will be just as perfect as your horse parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
And as Mike closed his eyes and was lost in another orgasm, the boy muttered &quot;Because all your parts will be horse parts, my soon to be draft horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike shuddered as he shot out another thick white splatter of equine cum on the straw bedding. <br />
<br />
The multiple orgasms were leaving him dazed and confused, but the intense pleasure of the two boys&#39; attention was like nothing he&#39;d ever felt before. But where was it all coming from? The bedding under him was almost hidden by the translucent white mass of sperm he&#39;d already released, but he could feel his testicles swelling out full and taut again as Liam rubbed them.<br />
<br />
The other boy, Aaron, had climbed up on Mike&#39;s back and was using the brush to pull out tangles in Mike&#39;s hair, grooming from the center of his forehead, along the middle of his skull, and down his neck. The long, slow strokes were hypnotic, dulling Mike&#39;s curiosity and making it easier to just accept this wonderful treatment.<br />
<br />
Pressure built yet again, and Mike let loose another immense gush of spunk. The ejaculation lasted incredibly long, two jets, three, four. This one left him panting and lathered in sweat. <br />
<br />
 &quot;I... don&#39;t know... if I can keep this up.&quot; He gasped out.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh, just getting you back to training age is good for 500 pounds.” Liam laughed. “Not to mention the rest of your imperfections.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five.. hundred... POUNDS?&quot; Mike blinked and shook his head, trying to focus his thoughts. &quot;What do you mean.. back.. to training age?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna be perfect, right?” Liam continued rubbing the huge ball-sack between Mike&#39;s hind legs as he spoke. “Well, to get you properly trained up, you need to be no more than 3 years old, but two is even better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two!?&quot; Mike twisted his head around to stare at the stable-boy. He felt really odd, but between the pleasure and confusion he couldn&#39;t pinpoint why. &quot;I&#39;d be a baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron was the one who answered. &quot;Nah, you&#39;re thinking of humans. A two-year-old Clydesdale is like a young human teenager. Just ready to start physical training.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike struggled to work out what was wrong with that, but another intense orgasm rocked his body and he gave a strangled whinny of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Whinny. <br />
<br />
That was finally enough for him to break out of the daze. his body felt weird, not the horse parts, but his upper body. The human parts. It took effort to reach up and feel his face - and both the spindly child&#39;s arms and the discovery of a protruding snout drove home the fact that there wasn&#39;t much human left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha.. &quot; Mike had to work to speak, his jaw not quite working right. &quot;Wha&#39; are you doin&#39; to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Making you perfect!&quot; Liam grinned and slapped Mike&#39;s rump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Aaron ran the brush down the middle of Mike&#39;s neck and back, brushing out the long mane. &quot;A perfect Clydesdale stallion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike wanted to fight back, to stop them, but the pleasant sensations of the stable boys was growing too much for him. <br />
<br />
He didn’t think he could hurt them if he wanted to. A small voice in the back of his mind wanted it to continue. Aaron tugged at his mane, and Mike could feel it growing longer more luxurious, and though he tried to deny it, he felt a surge of pride as the boys treated him like the prized stallion he was going to be. Liam gently rolled Mike’s massive, swollen balls in his hands. They were so soft and warm and lovely- <br />
<br />
He shuddered and and closed his eyes, whinnying lustily as yet another mind-blowing ejaculation rocked him. Mike couldn’t twist his head as much to see what was happening to him anymore. His upper body was becoming thicker and less mobile.<br />
<br />
“Good boy, Mike. You’re coming along nicely.” Aaron whispered in Mike’s twitching ears. He reached up and started scratching Mike’s head, reliving the itch he’d developed in his mane. His scratching move down to the line of fur creeping up Mike’s human upper body. “Such a good horse!”<br />
<br />
<i>I’m a good horse!</I> Mike thought and nickered happily, his balls tensing and then his huge cock spasmed, a load of horse seed splattering between his legs.<br />
<br />
The boys smiled and Aaron went back to brushing, removing any trace of fat from the stallion’s form. Under his touch, Mike’s legs bulked up. All the while, Liam rubbed and stroked former centaur’s hefty balls. Mike tried to move away, but the stable boy simply grabbed the centaur’s cock around his medial ring and squeezed and tugged at it.<br />
<br />
Mike felt pleasure jolt through him and came again, hard, blasting semen into the straw below. The fur rose further. Mike looked down just in time to see his abs melt away.<br />
<br />
“Bring in the dummy mare. I think he’ll like it.” Liam winked at Aaron.<br />
<br />
The younger stable boy nodded and ran further into the barn, a devious grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Muh frens’ll know um missin’.” Mike could barely speak now.<br />
<br />
“You mean your friends, right? Don’t worry, they’ll be joining you shortly.” Liam let go of his balls, allowing them to swing heavily between Mike’s hind legs. <br />
<br />
He picked up a brush and took over where Aaron had left off. The brushing felt so good-it all felt so good. His flanks swelled with muscle, ass rounding under Liam’s brush. His tail brushed against Liam’s face. He continued working on Mike’s fur, the black shifting to a chestnut brown flecked with white.<br />
<br />
Mike tried to move, but he felt so uneven. His backside was larger than his front. He caught his reflection in a nearby mirror and froze in shock.<br />
<br />
His face was pushing forward slowly, features a mix of horse and human. His teeth were large, distorted. His eyes were wider and farther apart. The soon-to-be-horse’s hair, once short and curly, had become a long, soft mane. It covered his eyes ever so slightly. His human chest thinned and smoothed, his pecs becoming just another muscle. What little was left of his arms dangled bonelessly from drooping shoulders. The scent of his own musk invaded nostrils that were wide and flaring.<br />
<br />
He could <I>feel</I> the chestnut brown fur as crept up his body. Mike’s insides gurgled as they rearrange and he shifted uncomfortably from hoof to hoof from the strange feelings. His cock was still throbbing, unattended, precum still drooling form the tip.<br />
<br />
Mike’s ear’s flicked towards the sound of wooden wheelz rolling across the stone floor. His eyes widened as Aaron wheeled a fake horse mount big enough to hold his weight inside. There was a large, fake vagina, puckers and lubed with oil that leaked around the lips and dribbled onto the floor. The smeel coming from it was delectable and he found himself raising his upper lips involuntarily.<br />
<br />
“Now we ain’t gonna force you to do anything you don’t want to. We’re just gonna leave it right here.” Liam smirked.<br />
<br />
Mike’s cock moved by itself, slapping against his belly as he craned his head closer to the mare, tongue involuntarily lapping at it. Lost in the heady aroma of mare, it wasn’t until his cock was ready to blow that he realized he was masturbating. He gave another high whinny and came, huffing and panting.<br />
<br />
The brothers watched as he came, seeing him wrestle with the needs of his body. His arms receded into the base of his new neck, only the hands sticking out. Mike’s nostrils flared in agitation and he started to back away.<br />
<br />
“Liam, I think he needs a stronger whiff.” Aaron winked.<br />
<br />
Mike tried to say something, but only strange, guttural sounds and strangled whinnies would exit his throat. Liam shoved the dummy mare closer to him, the vagina bumping his nose. His eyes widened and stayed there, big and staring as he scented mare in heat. He couldn’t resist anymore, he <I>needed</I> to fuck it.<br />
<br />
He heaved himself up onto the dummy mare with a powerful neigh, cock at full mast. Mike tried to fight his urges, though his lower body started thrusting involuntarily, trying to find the needy hole of the mount. <br />
<br />
“Looks like he’s more horse than centaur now. Help him hit his target.” Liam directed, and went to a shelf, bringing out a bottle of mare pheromones and emptied it on a cloth. “I’ll make sure he’s raring to go.”<br />
<br />
Mike tried to stop, thinking of his friends and family, anything other than the cloying scent that was forcing him to hump. Then Aaron’s hands were on his sizeable shaft, guiding his engorged member to the target. The flat tip of his dick entered the moist lips and he shuddered mid-thrust as pleasure shook him and he emptied his balls again. He resumed thrusting, slowly shoving his cock into the fake passage. <br />
<br />
Liam strapped the cloth to his nose flooding his brain with pheromones and the former centaur shivered again in orgasm. His thrusts grew vigorous, frantic, as his face stretched out into a horse’s muzzle. The stable boy resumed fondling the horse’s balls, keeping him filled and churning with seed.<br />
<br />
Mike came and came again, the world growing hazy. With each orgasm his body tingled. His human torso faded into the long, thick neck of a draft horse. What reamined of his hands shrunk away, much of the mass contributing to the muscle growth of his front legs. His chest thickened and barrelled out, the black fur overwhelmed by a wave of chestnut fur. The dumy mare creaked under the weight.<br />
<br />
“Man, he’s really going at it!” Aaron grinned. “Maybe his friends will be the same.”<br />
<br />
“I hope so. Do you know how much money we can get for making a kirin with that dragon?” Liam asked as he spied the dragon in the town square just outside. <br />
<br />
“Maybe we can transform them into dummy mares for Chester here.” Aaron said as he pat Mike’s rump.<br />
<br />
Mike’s mind was lost in a sea of pleasure. All he could do was whinny and bray. He saw himself in the mirror and watched his green eyes dull, his iris becoming wide and brown. Mike ejaculated again, and he suddenly found that he was having trouble understanding what the stable boys were saying. The sounds they were making were vaguely pleased and excited.<br />
<br />
Memories of his human life faded away with the years he lost, but in exchange, his body bulked up. The fake vagina felt like it was massaging his dick. With each pulse, his balls grew heavier, his cock swelled deeper, sliding sensuously through the slick tunnel. With each pound and slap of his nuts on the dummy they grew larger, bigger than apples. He came, jostling his thoughts out of his head and his body swelled ever larger, towering up nearly 9 feet tall. <br />
<br />
<i>I…I need….I need to…</I> Mike thought, though the act grew more mentally straining by the second. Mike’s life as a human was replaced with being raised in the field to be a perfect draft horse. <br />
<br />
<i>I need to cum!</I><br />
<br />
His cock bottomed out in the mare. With one last squeeze, the lips tickled his shaft. Chester’s whinny was so loud it could be heard throughout the town. The last changes happened, growing a little large. The only thoughts left in his mind were of food, sex, and pleasing his master.<br />
<br />
A minute passed. The boys grinned, feeling the magic stabilize in their new horse. His thrusts started to die down. Chester nickered happily as Liam removed the cloth and gave him a carrot to munch on. <br />
<br />
“Man, what a keeper! Wonder how full the cum receptacle is.” Aaron said as he helped Chester off the mare.<br />
<br />
Liam cleaned off their new stallion’s dick as Aaron pulled the mount away.<br />
<br />
“You won’t believe this!” Aaron pointed to the bag at the bottom of the mare. “He’s so virile<br />
<br />
It was absolutely full, the opaque liquid inside the bag sloshing as Liam removed it. They could impregnate many horses with a sample this sizeable. It was a windfall of cash in a bag.<br />
<br />
“We’re going to have to throw it away. There might still be some centaur cum inside of it.” Liam reminded his co-worker gently. <br />
<br />
He hated being so wasteful, but Liam knew they didn’t want a centaur being born accidentally.<br />
<br />
Aaron sighed and nodded. He rubbed Chester&#39;s big head and lead the horse to his stall. <br />
<br />
“Now to get the others in here and under my care.” Liam mused</p>
