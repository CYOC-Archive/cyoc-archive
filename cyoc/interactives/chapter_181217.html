<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The open box revealed four pieces, each representing a player. They seemed to be carved from wood and painted different colours, red, green, blue, and yellow.<br />
Naturally, Monique picked the red piece without consulting anyone else.<br />
Jewell looked to Liberty, who was still deciding what she wanted. Jewell hesitated before placing her hand on the blue piece, she made sure Liberty wouldn’t be annoyed. But she clearly didn’t mind.<br />
Liberty was still trying to figure out if she wanted a green or yellow piece, her hands hovering above both. She wasn’t able to decide, she liked both colours!<br />
“Ahem!” Monique said, not-so subtly. Liberty jumped a little before just grabbing the yellow one.<br />
<br />
“So what is the... aim of the game?” Jewell asked, quietly.<br />
“I think we just roll the dice and-” Liberty started, moving her hand to grab the dice. But before she could even finish speaking, Monique snatched the dice from the board, she looked at them in her hands,<br />
“I’ll go first,” Monique said, not acknowledging that anyone might have been speaking beforehand, “and then you can go,” she said, not pointing to anyone in particular. Liberty nor Jewell knew who she was talking about, “then you,” Monique finished. This time, looking Jewell dead in the eyes, piercing her pupils with an intense stare.<br />
<br />
She threw the dice, landing right next to each other. <br />
She got 2 and 5.<br />
<br />
She went to move her piece 7 spaces, but before she could place her piece on the board, it flew out of her hand. Landing on her starting spot, it then proceeded to move seven spaces.<br />
Monique was a little shocked by it, but she waved her hair back and then signalled to Liberty to roll the dice. Liberty stood there, a little confused, but went to comply,<br />
“Sorry, Monique, I think you-” Jewell started speaking, but was quickly cut off,<br />
“Is there a problem, JT?” She asked, in a condescending manor. She called Jewell by the name her fans often called her. This made her feel a little annoyed, addressing her as simply a celebrity, rather than an equal, especially considering that Jewell was way more successful than Monique, especially to a younger demographic. But she shook it off and finished what she was saying,<br />
“I was going to say... you need to pick up your card before Liberty can take her turn,”<br />
<br />
“Hm,” Monique said, rolling her eyes at the teenager talking down to her, but played along.<br />
She picked up a card from the top of the deck. She read it aloud,<br />
“Coloured hair, changed from black,<br />
How about we take it back.”<br />
Monique scowled at the card, it was almost like she was being mocked by the game. She ran her hands through her hair, not noticing that the bleach was disappearing and returning to her natural black colour.<br />
She hit Liberty on the side of the arm. Liberty, once again, jumped a little before grabbing the dice for herself. She looked into the spots on each one, they looked like they were glowing a little. She liked the look of it.<br />
She let them go, allowing them to roll freely. They were almost on opposite ends of the table.<br />
She scored a 2 and a 1.<br />
<br />
She scooped up her dice and handed them to Jewell, who was pleasantly surprised by the action.<br />
Liberty picked up her card, she took a moment before realising she needed to turn it over.<br />
Before reading it, Jewell, almost professionally, rattled the dice in her hand before rolling it on the table. She didn’t see the numbers until after Liberty had read out her card. This was also the moment Jewell noticed Monique’s drastic hair change.<br />
<br />
“Making your name on a magazine,<br />
Share your age with the bright eighteen,”<br />
<br />
Liberty, unlike usual, was not the only one in the room who was confused. However, Jewell might have a decent idea.<br />
Liberty’s skin suddenly felt a lot less tense. She was 28 years old, but was beginning to feel younger. Her natural blonde began to look brighter, the minor wrinkles on her face were slowly disappearing. There wasn’t much to change, as there had only been 10 years since she was 18, but she felt more youthful. Not to mention the tiny height difference. She was lucky that she refused to have any work done on her, otherwise it probably would’ve stuck out much more.<br />
<br />
Monique and Jewell looked on in shock, they had just seen her turn from a fully grown adult to a teenager just turned adult.<br />
<br />
Everyone stared at Liberty, but before long, Liberty and Monique were staring at Jewell. She was confused, but then realised that she’d rolled,<br />
5 and 3.<br />
<br />
She hesitantly picked up her card, hoping for something minor, if anything at all. Turned it over, taking a deep breath in before reading it out loud,<br />
“Bigger is better, but how about a lot,<br />
A glass of milk will hit the spot!”<br />
<br />
Monique smirked.<br />
<br />
Jewell looked at herself, confused and scared. She didn’t know what was going to happen but she had hundreds of thoughts in her head. Then she started feeling something.<br />
She felt a slight pressure in her chests, just beneath her nipples. It was oddly sensitive and against her bra. She started feeling some newer weight, unfamiliar to her. She could see that her breasts were growing, and she could feel it too. They were heavier, stingier, jigglier. Her bra was starting to struggle with the rising volume of breasts, straining tighter and tighter against them. She let out a groan of discomfort as it suddenly snapped, breaking the connection. Her breasts now had no support, and this quickly dropped down. They outlined her sweater more and more, her nipples rubbing against the fabric of her it too, making them even more sensitive. They began poking through it. They kept growing, pushing more and more against the sweater.<br />
Liberty looked on in horror, but Monique was enjoying it. She never liked Jewell, and didn’t pretend to, either. Maybe by the end of this whole game she’d be more boob than woman and her career would be over.<br />
Jewell’s chest was starting to feel tight, filled to the brim with what could only be assumed as milk. Then suddenly, one button popped off, revealing the much deeper cleavage than before. But they kept growing, bigger and bigger, reaching head size. And they kept growing. The next button popped off, they were beginning to maybe start slowing down. Then they reached head size, popping two buttons almost at the exact same time. The growing was slowing, but not slow enough for the last button to pop right off. The sweater opened all the way, revealing her two very large breasts. Her nipples had definitely increased too, not that anyone other than Jewell herself knew that.<br />
<br />
She let her breathing slow, as she came back to the real world. She let out two long breaths before opening her eyes and looking at her full, perfectly shaped breasts. They sat so far out on her body that her belly almost looked flat.<br />
She looked down, unable to see anything below her breasts. She tried to lift them up, but quickly let go. It wasn’t just her nipple that was sensitive.<br />
<br />
“H-ho-how...” Jewell tried to start saying, “d-do I... fix th-them..?” she asked the group, sitting in an uncomfortable position, terrified to touch her chest.<br />
Monique stood up and stood in front of Jewell, looking at her chest. She moved her hand to touch one of Jewell’s breasts, “Well, dear, looks like you’re-” she was quickly cut off as she poked her breast, a stream of clearly high pressured milk sprayed her right in the face, splashing all over her hair and top, which was now soaked. However, the stream didn’t stop. Her left breast was now constantly pouring a stream of milk out of her nipple. All over the floor.<br />
“You... BITCH!” Monique screamed at Jewell. In a rage, she grabbed both Jewell’s breasts and squeezed them as hard as she could. Jewell couldn’t help but moan loudly as both breasts shot two super powerful streams of milk. The left hitting Monique once again, this time right into her own breasts. The other shot it directly at Liberty, who managed to quickly dodge out of the way. The stream was powerful enough to hit the back of the room, splattering all over a beautiful painting and several decorative items, which as far as anyone was concerned were antique.<br />
<br />
Liberty grabbed Monique and pulled her away from Jewell, who was now in an almost climactic state, slowly making her way back to reality.<br />
“She didn’t mean to, Mona!” Liberty said, grabbing Monique by her shoulders and looked her in the eyes,<br />
“I don’t care, this is my second favourite house! There’s milk everywhere!” Monique said, furious,<br />
“Yeah but you can fix that, okay. Jewell, on the other hand, is only going to make more of a mess unless we help her,” Liberty said, seeing the fire in Monique’s eyes begin to die out,<br />
“Okay, fine. But I’m making her pay for everything,” Monique said, a lot more calmed down,<br />
“Okay, we’ll talk about that after we sort this out. We’ll pack up the game and push the event until next week... and we’ll invite someone else, okay?” Liberty said. She took her hands off of Monique and then made her way back to the steadily leaking Jewell Terrell.<br />
<br />
“Jewell?” Liberty said, hesitant to touch her,<br />
“Y-yeah,” she responded, only sounding half there. Her eyes were almost rolled into the back of her head. They could only imagine how much pleasure she was experiencing right now,<br />
“Okay, hon, I think...” Liberty started. She looked at Jewell’s chest, they looked to have shrunk a little, and her left was a little smaller than the right. Liberty might not always be aware of what’s going on, but she was far from an idiot, “I think we need to empty you out to get you can go back to normal,”<br />
“Uh...” Jewell said, trying her best to focus with the pleasure still lingering around her highly sensitive breasts.<br />
<br />
Monique returned, trying her best not to start screaming at the pools of milk on the floor. She was carrying two buckets and what looked like a breast pump. Jewell looked at them and was felt in shock as she realised just how much milk she had in her breasts. She wanted to be done with this all, but she knew she had to find a way to fix her breasts. Not to mention,<br />
<br />
The game was far from over.</p>
