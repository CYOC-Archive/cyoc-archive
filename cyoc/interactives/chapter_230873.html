<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     I got home from my appointment and immediately went to my room, taking off my panties. They were still damp from his cum and my arousal and I couldn&#39;t stop myself from sniffing them the scent of cum filled my head and I felt the now familiar feminine arousal spreading from my vagina.i did my best to ignore it and found a clean pair of panties before starting on my homework. A half hour in my phone chimed, checking it I saw a text message from him asking me how I felt. I texted him back telling him that I was doing my homework and asked him what he was doing. Putting my phone back down I finished up and went to the bathroom. Sitting on the toilet I looked between my legs watching my pee stream out of my body and thought back to the bathroom and watching him go pee. I reached down and started playing with myself rubbing my outer labia, getting my hand wet with pee and other stuff. Bladder empty I stood up and wiped front to back before heading back to my room. I had more messages from him asking what I was doing. I told him that I just went pee with a water emoji and silly face. He responded saying that he wished he was there and we could&#39;ve peed together again. I closed my eyes thinking back to watching him pee. Shaking my head clear I called him a pervert using a smiley face emoji to let him know I was kidding.<br />
     We chatted for a while. It was fun getting to know him. He asked me again if I missed anything about being a boy and I admitted I missed being able to pee standing up but overall I was enjoying being a girl. I asked him if he missed anything about being a girl and he responded with no! I went back to my homework when I got a video message from Oliver. I quickly opened it to see my now his penis fully erect, he was playing with himself casually fondling his balls and stroking his length. I felt myself getting hotter and breathing faster as I watched him masturbate. It was incredible watching him. He didn&#39;t take long before he ejaculated long arcs of cum spurting from his penis and as he milked himself for every drop. He let go of his penis and smeared the cum over his stomach before ending the video. I watched it a few more times as heat radiated throughout my body and I felt an aching need between my legs. I got up and locked my door before ripping off my panties and laying down on my bed. I looked down between my legs at nothing. It felt weird that as horny and aroused as I was there was nothing to show for it and I loved it. I got my phone and started recording as I rubbed my outer labia juices squishing over my fingers as I teased myself. I pushed my fingers inside moaning softly as pleasure filled my body, I kept plunging my fingers deeper and pulling them out barely able to hold my phone steady. I closed my eyes and bit my lips as I lost myself in pleasure. I pushed a second finger inside thinking about someday having a boy inside me. I fingered myself holding on for as long as I could before allowing myself to climax, my pussy gripping my fingers as I squirted over my hand. I kept my fingers inside as I tried to control my breathing as pleasure continued to flow through my body in waves stopping the recording. I sent it to Oliver and waited.<br />
    It didn&#39;t take long for him to respond with a dick pic saying wishing I was there. Just thinking about him and I together made me horny again and I started rubbing myself. I was so distracted I never noticed my door click on slowly open. My mouth was open slightly and I licked my lips when suddenly “ whose penis is that!?” I jumped up and tried to cover myself as I looked around wildly seeing John standing next to my bed. Looking embarrassed as I tried to hide my wet fingers and failing horribly I sat up keeping myself covered. “ it&#39;s mine… well it used to be at least” he looked confused” did you take pictures of your penis?” I put my phone down making sure it was locked “ no I didn&#39;t but I meet him at the doctor and we traded numbers after peeing and masturbating together” I mumbled the last part but John heard everything “ so your telling me that you meet the person who traded bodies with you and not only did you pee with him but masturbated? And now you&#39;re sharing dick pics??” I nodded “ and some clit pics” “ can I see?” He asked so innocently and looking at him sitting there next to me with an obvious erection I couldn&#39;t help but say “of course”.<br />
      I opened my phone and showed him the video of Oliver masturbating and then showed him mine, his eyes widened as he watched me and he unconsciously rubbed his erection through his pants”. I put my phone down and watched him “ having troubles?” He looked at me “ kinda” I could remember how annoying erections could be especially when you ignored them” wanna take care of it?” He thought about it for about a microsecond and eagerly unzipped his pants and pulled out his erect penis. Just seeing it made me want to grab it. It took all my self control not too. Scooting over I made room for him to join me. We masturbated together as only siblings do leaning against each other.<br />
        We masturbated together stroking and fingering ourselves to the point of no return, with a soft grunt John ejaculated long arcs of cum spurting from his penis and landing on his stomach with a soft splat. The sight and smell of it was more than enough to push me over the edge and I  climaxed shortly after. I laid there heat radiating throughout my body as he played with his semi erect penis before getting up and putting his pants on, he leaned down and kissed me on the lips “ thanks sis” with a smirk he left my room as silently as he had entered.</p>
