<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay found the program surprisingly easy to navigate, as if he had seen it before. As he explored it he soon <br />
realized it was not a game, but about making changes to himself or others. as crazy as a thought that was, he <br />
felt that it might actually work. <br />
<br />
'This is my chance' he grew more excited as he found this could be a solution to his uneasiness about his <br />
life.<br />
Seeing he could alter his age his age, Jay fantasized being in high school, 'If I was in high school, then I <br />
could be on the school football team, and be cool'<br />
<br />
And if he was older, maybe dad could let him help in the shop... the possibilities seemed endless for a little <br />
kid to become a big kid.<br />
<br />
Jay entered in some information into the Chronivac, mainly just to change his age, the other parts were <br />
confusing and a overwhelming to deal with, so he stuck with the one option he was sure of...<br />
<br />
INITIALIZING SYSTEM: SUBJECT TRANSFORMATION - AGE PROGRESSION 9 YRS<br />
<br />
Jay stood still in anticipation, not much seemed to be happening. Maybe he was getting taller? he looked over <br />
at the mirror in his dad's room, yeah, maybe taller.<br />
<br />
Then, quite suddenly, an immense tingling sensation radiated as he underwent a massive growth spurt. The high <br />
level of testosterone in his family's genes kicked in with a vengeance as Jay hit puberty.<br />
<br />
Now Jay was sure it was working, as he watched himself intensely through the mirror. He had grown by at least <br />
a foot already. <br />
<br />
Jay was beginning to feel itchy in many places and a general uncomfortableness as his clothes began to pinch. <br />
He pulled off his pants, unbuttoned and threw off his shirt. <br />
<br />
he first noticed the pronounced bulge in his ever tightening underwear and the not so subtle dark pubic hair <br />
crawling out from his briefs.  <br />
<br />
Hair was already prominent on his legs, while the lighter, softer hair on his arms was gaining in presence.<br />
<br />
His face was changing a lot as it lengthened. His jaw line was beginning to stand out as the fat in his cheeks <br />
lessened. A prominent adams apple pushed out from his throat making his voice drop significantly.<br />
<br />
his more pronounced chin and upper lip darkened quickly with a burst of prickly stubble, giving Jay a more <br />
mature appearance rather quickly. <br />
<br />
He continued to inch further up in height, but now his body was catching up to his spurt, gaining weight fast. <br />
His broadening shoulders were further enhanced by his rounding deltoids. His biceps swelling to dominate his <br />
arms.<br />
<br />
His pectorals pushed outward, as they stretched across his expanding chest. Hair then began sprouting in the <br />
newly formed valley of his chest and started spreading up and outward towards his collar bones while hair <br />
started radiating outward from his pecs. <br />
<br />
His abs, having become very prominent faded slightly as Jay grew thicker all around, with the subtle begging <br />
of his family's gut. the obscuring of his abs was further aided by a massive expansion of hair upon his <br />
stomach which shot upward almost to meet up with the base of his pecs.<br />
<br />
His forearms, with muscle pushing out making them look much thicker were now also heavily shaded with dark <br />
hair that disseminated across his hands and tapered as it stretched upon his upper arms.<br />
<br />
the changes were slowing much more as Jay finally approached 17, with most occurring in his mass and the <br />
increase in hair just about everywhere. He was clearly more developed than an average 17 year old, but was <br />
probably closer in appearance to his peers than his father of grandfather were. <br />
<br />
his sharp masculine features were in contrast with his more youthful face. his pronounced jaw was lined with <br />
dark stubbly hairs, with softer, thinner hair reaching towards his cheeks. his hair line was receded a little <br />
bit but not in any real noticeable way that only made Jay look older for his age, like a collage student <br />
perhaps. <br />
<br />
He also wasn't nearly as hairy or thick as his dad, he still had some bare patches on his chest, though this <br />
was still more than most other kids his age would have. Nor could he grow a full beard, with some parts of his <br />
facial hair not yet connecting. His lower amounts of testosterone would draw out it's full effects until he <br />
got older<br />
<br />
The Chroniva chimed- <br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION (AGE PROGRESSION 9 YRS) COMPLETE<br />
<br />
Jay let out a long gasp, as if had held his breath the whole time. The seep sound of his voice surprised him. <br />
His naturally athletic build, family's high testosterone, and a handsome, strong but youthful face all <br />
combined were sure to make him a star in school.<br />
<br />
He looked down to realize his briefs had ripped off, exposing his large penis, which seemed to have grown long <br />
in an attempt to run from his thick pubic hair. <br />
<br />
after starring for a while in pride, Jay stumbled over to his dad's closet, not used to his boy's size and <br />
weight, to find some clothes.<br />
<br />
afraid of messing with his dad's preferred clothing, he just put on a white shirt and a pair of jeans, which <br />
were still much to loose for him due to his dad's roundness. So he found a belt to hold up his pants<br />
<br />
Jay was unsure of what to do next, he hadn't really thought things through. What will dad and grams think? <br />
started buzzing through his head. he was feeling nervous <br />
<br />
what would he do now?...</p>
