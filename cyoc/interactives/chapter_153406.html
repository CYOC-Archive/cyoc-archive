<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Going back several minutes before the trio stepped foot onto the front porch steps.*<br />
<br />
The warm air of the summer was in full swing, baking anything and everything that came into contact with it as beads of sweat were released from any creature&#39;s pores to cool them down from the increased temperature. However, around the cabin it was a little different as the air was a few degrees cooler around it as a feeling of electricity permeated the air, the energy being drawn from the heat as the cabin could sense its new owners approaching. Getting closer and closer the electric charge in the air continued to grow, the cabin feeding and preparing for the desires to be made manifest. Ever since Ryan verbally agreed to enter into an agreement of ownership of the cabin, it could feel a strong desire for the new owner to have greater changes in his life than normally possible. There was no distinction of what it was. There were no details... just a sense of strong desire. However, as the trio grew closer and closer to the very driveway, the cabin could sense more... knowing that they had a desire to be animals... real beasts, both in the human sense and the animal. It could tell that the three of them had a thing for big, thick, burly men and all three of them had desires to be with each other sexually, but would never admit it to one another in fear of severe judgment. Once they were actually on the property, the tires of their vehicle touching the dirt pathway, it sent more signals for the cabin to prepare... to know what they wanted. The cabin knew that the trio were all into werewolves as well, but it wasn&#39;t until the three stepped foot on the property and Ryan grasped the keys found under the werewolf themed welcome mat that it was finally able to know the desires in their hearts... for Ryan to both remain as their father, but as their lover and the same from both of his boys equally wanting their father to remain their father, but also their lover... as well as being equally as submissive to each other with their father lording over them. The house could sense they wanted their father to be a god to pleasure and worship, which the house was very eager to let them experience just that. This whole time that the house had been feeding, it slowly changed some of the interior to match their likes and desires; normal and mundane items and structural pieces becoming lupine or featuring werewolf-esque iconography. The front door knocker going from an old Victorian style to a sculpted wolf&#39;s head with the tongue sticking out and loose, acting as the actual knocking element against the oak door behind it. The doorknob still oval and yet flattened like a pancake developed lycanthropic carving inside of it to allow for a look that would make the three men smile with enthusiasm, giving them a taste of what they would find more of once they were inside.<br />
<br />
*Back to the present time*<br />
<br />
Ryan thumbed the key in his hand with a smile, feeling a sense of pride... a sense of ownership that he had never experienced before... along with a sense of domination that not only dug deep down within him and started rooting itself in his very core, but made him feel more alive and more invigorated by what he was doing than anything else had in his life. He looked at his sons differently too... like they were belonging to him and only him, finding the desire to be with his own sons increasing to the point where he could feel himself start to harden below. He grinned at the thought, not really caring if his boys saw him like this... they were all men after all and it was a natural process. In fact... for as long as his true memory served, he always told his boys to let their erections be so that their penile growth wouldn&#39;t be stunted... just in case. He wasn&#39;t sure if doing things to make it go down would reduce their adult size, but being a lover of thick cock... Ryan never wanted to take that chance with his boys so they could please whomever their male lover was.<br />
<br />
With the key in hand, Ryan aligned the pole with the hole and slowly inserted the key into the lock. Feeling it was in completely, he turned it and felt the tumblers give way to allow the key to turn the tongue and pull it back inside the door, no longer barring their entrance into their new home. Suddenly there was a haughty air that rushed out of the older mansion for a home and breezed over them. It was cool, comforting and welcoming as if someone had turned on the air conditioning and left it on in expectation of their arrival. With a giant smile on his face, Ryan looked to each of his sons that flanked him and said, &quot;Alright boys... time to claim this place and make it ours!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Ryan stepped through first, then Brandon and then Ethan right behind. Smiling, Ryan turned around on his heels and locked the door behind them as the two boys looked around the entry with a bit of awe and wonder, taking notice of the mural of the full moon on the floor and a large, moon-like orb hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the vestibule where a large, circular, wooden staircase hugged against the wall and slowly inclined upward for access to the second and third floors. At the base of the banister, the head was carved into an anthropomorphic werewolf&#39;s head with the stem being the rest of it&#39;s massive and burly humanesque body that screamed masculinity. Both Brandon and Ethan popped a huge amount of wood, but did nothing about it... in fact, they embraced it, feeling the odd power that seemed to flow through the mansion pushing them forward, making them bigger as their cocks throbbed in their pants.<br />
<br />
Ryan grinned as he saw the fruit of his loins popping thick wood like they were, wishing they were even thicker... monstrously so, knowing that they were a little above average from the outline they showed off proudly. &quot;Well, boys... what do you think so far?! I think this place was made just for us... what with all of the werewolf themed things just in this room alone. I wonder what else we will find in here.&quot; Ryan said, his presence and voice making them turn to face him with big smiles on their faces. Ryan just grinned as his teeth slowly started to take on a little more length, sharper points all while his ears started to take on a bit of a lupine look to them as they bent backward slightly at the halfway point of the outer lobe and formed into pointed hybrid tips at the end. It wasn&#39;t all that noticeable unless someone was looking for discernable changes to point a finger and shout that one was a werewolf... or a beast... of some nature. &quot;So boys... where to next? Upstairs to the second or third floors? To the left room to see what&#39;s there? To the right for the same? Perhaps the hall underneath the stairs or do you think there is a secret passage to explore to find even more... maybe more sinister or risque things that are werewolf related?</p>
