<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So what do you think Molly? Should I drive you to a veterinarian or a human doctor?” I asked from Molly who sat on the shotgun seat of the car.<br />
<br />
“How the heck I should know. I’m more than embarrassed when I need to witness you explaining how the thing got inside me.” Molly replies back.<br />
<br />
“God I wish we had a vet as friend so we wouldn’t have to do this.” I replied back to her.<br />
<br />
“Should I call my mom and ask if she knows a doctor or a vet?” Molly asks as she tries her best to use her nose open her smartphone.<br />
<br />
“I guess we should ask her first before we go to a random public health care doctor who might not believe when I tell them what happened to you.” I sigh on my driver’s seat while thinking if I should start the car’s engine or not.<br />
<br />
I turned my head to look at my Persian hound girlfriend with ninety percent Salute blood in her veins. Molly had transformed into a feral dog who was stripped away from her humanity. We noticed that the horrible injection on her thigh was starting to change her life upside down. The first visible transformation was her height. Second was when her dark and light brown hair started to take over her body hair from thin layer of normal sized hair into a full dog coat which covered her whole body from head to back paws. Then she noticed how she couldn’t walk with her bipedal feet anymore. Molly had explained that, at some point during her transformation, walking on all fours felt more natural and she had forgotten how to stand up like a human. The last bits of her Molly-esc features that didn&#39;t transform were her blue human eyes and eyesight, her human voice and her human shaped soul inside her heart. Molly had gained an ability to communicate with other domesticated dogs by using their body language but she was still capable to act and move her joint like she did when she was human. Molly gestured her needs with her front paws and use human sign language to communicate. Molly&#39;s voice had gotten a bit high pitched but she had retained her full human articulation.<br />
<br />
She explained during her transformation how every day items and services as a dog felt wrong and that she didn&#39;t feel comfortable with speaking in front of other humans when she had been transforming for a month. Molly loved to run around the house but blamed that she got zoomies from her feral side. She also explained how human food felt weird as she couldn’t use things like forks or other tools to guide the food to her mouth. At first using her tongue felt difficult but as her feral side got stronger her heightened dog-like senses awakened themselves. She was able to smell my cock more easily which made her constantly horny as we used to make love every week. Molly&#39;s need for sexual pleasure and constant cuddles had also gone up. This meant that one day we wanted to give it a try.<br />
<br />
At first I saw nothing wrong with Molly being a dog, but when we finally entered the bedroom and I lowered my underwear. Molly was disappointed at me when I told her that I couldn’t get it hard and it felt weird to fuck her in her cookie hole. I explained to her that needed more time to get my head space on right track. She suggested that we should try oral sex but even when she ate two mouth fresheners, and I used condom, the oral experience was subpar at best. My dick couldn’t get over the fact that Molly was a horny Persian hound and not a beautiful lady as she used to be. So in the end we went with the most safest option and on that night I ejaculated in front of her on top of her maw and she ate my sperm like it was plain sugary yogurt treat for her.<br />
<br />
But that was two months ago. Right now I am more comfortable with her feral appearance and today during our normal routine. Molly asked from me that she needed my thumbs to help her with her heat. She really begged my cock inside her feral cookie hole. She whined and begged from me to have sex with her but I still refused. So in the end I had to act as her glorified rubber toy holder to her scorched and heated needy little pussy. We did the generic sixty nine position as she presented her feral cookie on my face while she sucked my cock on top of me with her doggy lips and tongue. I guess I lubed the wand bit too many times as a disaster struck right after I rubbed her too intensely from behind. I accidentally shoved the lubed up wand into her triangle shaped pleasure hole as it went fast inside her dog pussy like how a sauced up wiener slides down a hungry cum gargling whore’s throat. Thankfully I was able to stop the magic wand from buzzing with my index finger. Her winking pussy couldn&#39;t stop from twitching like a blinker light as I had to push my fingers pretty deep inside her. The sudden slurping sensation made my girlfriend tremor and jitter in pleasure but the pleasure stick was now stuck inside Molly’s feral vagina and we couldn’t pull it out of her body.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t the middle of night but it was past sleeping hours. I had no time to dress so I had to take my t-shirt, boxers, sweatpants, slippers and woolen jacket with me on the car. I had my wallet on my jacket’s pocket and keys were on my right hand. Molly had nothing on her except the wand inside her and her smartphone which I grabbed for her with my spare hand after the keys. We were waiting for her mother to pick up the phone.</p>
