<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Kent had completed his assignment for history class in the library at the high school, he carefully walked over to the tall shelving unit, where he returned the book to its rightful location on the top shelf, which was over 6 feet from the ground.<br />
<br />
Normally, that would have been a problem for Kent, who was about 5 foot 5” tall. But, having Ty looking after him had proven to show another one of its benefits. Ty cared deeply about the scared, geeky kid, and he would use every opportunity to change Kent in any way he saw fit or necessary.<br />
<br />
No sooner had Kent stepped away from the section where the books were, or he began to feel that all-too-familiar tingling feeling in his long, stretched-out legs.<br />
<br />
Kent helplessly looked on, as he felt like his legs had frozen in place. Then, without warning, the shrinking started. Kent could only look sideways and gasp, when it seemed like the shelf started to grow taller and taller, when in fact his long legs were shrinking back to their normal size.<br />
<br />
Within moments, the top shelf was out of reach again, and the shrinking stopped when Kent had reached his regular height once again.<br />
<br />
After his legs had become unfrozen once again, he continued to walk towards the exit, where he passed the loan desk. The librarian just stared at the boy, as he grabbed a pen and signed off on a sheet of paper that was placed on the long, flat counter before him.<br />
<br />
“Were you able to find all the books you needed?” the librarian asked the short, geeky student.<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am. I only needed one book this time.”<br />
<br />
“I forgot to give you that little ladder of mine. Were you able to reach and get the book you needed?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am” he responded politely. “I had no problems finding and getting my book today!”<br />
<br />
“Alright then, Kent. I’ll see you tomorrow…”<br />
<br />
Kent then walked out the library and cut across the grassy field on the vast schoolyard, as he walked straight towards the science lab. He had an assignment to work on which wouldn’t be due till the end of the following week, but Kent made it a point to always have all his science homework done at least a week ahead of time. Kent was a straight-A student across the board, and math, science, biology, chemistry, and physics were all his favorite classes in school. He was the best, the smartest and the brightest, and he always had his homework finished far in advance.<br />
<br />
When he walked into the science lab, he grabbed a small, shiny rock from a collection of rocks, which he had added on to himself. He placed it under the microscope and adjusted the eyepiece, so he could study the shape of the rock. He was in awe of the beautiful shine texture on the exterior of the rock, and he loved looking at it up close. He practically wished he could shrink so that he could see the rock up close, with his own eyes, rather than looking through an eyepiece of a microscope.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he began to hear that very familiar voice, ringing in his ears. Only he could hear it, for the voice was coming from inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Ahhh you want to shrink, huh?” Ty’s voice boomed inside of him. Kent just froze for a moment. He knew what Ty was capable of. All he could do was stop what he was doing and listen to Ty, and wait to see what Ty was going to do to him this time. He meekly accepted Ty’s transformations, for he understood that Ty had absolute control over his body, and there was no way for him to stop them.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want anything bad to happen to you while you’re tiny, Kent” Ty’s voice said. “I’d hate to see someone step on you and kill you, due to me shrinking you. So, I need to give you some more strength and powers, so you can defend yourself and get around easily, when the world just becomes a giant place around you! Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Ty…” Kent said quietly. “You’re the boss, Ty. Whatever you say, Ty!”<br />
<br />
“You know what? I’m gonna give you super powers first. I’m gonna make you change into a super hero, but you will only have the powers after the shrinking has completed!”<br />
<br />
“Super powers?” Kent wondered out loud. “What kind of….”<br />
<br />
Kent’s body suddenly froze in place, as Ty went to work. Ty didn’t have to explain what he was going to do to Kent. He just did it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kent’s clothes disappeared, and a blue and red colored costume had appeared out of nowhere, covering all of Kent’s body. The colorful costume had fit around his body like a wetsuit, and it fit perfectly. <br />
<br />
Next, Kent’s muscles suddenly inflated slightly. He wasn’t freakish, he just looked like a gymnast with muscle.<br />
<br />
Finally, his legs began to tingle, as he felt Ty actually taking control over his body. Kent climbed on a chair, which was standing right beside the table, where the microscope was. Kent stepped from the chair on to the table. <br />
<br />
When he finally was standing on the table, wearing his blue-and-red body suit, his entire body started to tingle once more.<br />
<br />
As Kent stared around the classroom, he noticed that the world rapidly started to grow around him. The ceiling seemed to get farther away, as the chalk boards and the windows appeared to be growing. When he looked down, he noted that the table was growing, becoming longer, wider, bigger. At first, the table seemed to be only a few feet long. Now, the feet became yards. Then it became the length of a football field.<br />
<br />
When he turned around, he noted that the microscope was rapidly increasing in size, along with the growing, shiny rock, which he was studying.<br />
<br />
Kent grinned, as he saw the rock grow in size, until the rock was about as tall as him!<br />
<br />
Within moments, the classroom had become a whole new world for him. The shiny rock now appeared to him as a giant, shiny boulder. <br />
<br />
It had finally dawned on him. He was only one inch tall.<br />
<br />
That’s when the super powers kicked in. Since the distances were so great, he didn’t want to waste time climbing, running, and walking. As soon as he extended his muscular arms before him, he felt his body lift off from the table, and he was now able to fly!<br />
<br />
When he landed beside the microscope, he just cheered out loud, as the giant boulder sat there, waiting for the tiny student to come over and admire it with his own eyes. No longer was the microscope needed.<br />
<br />
Kent loved being tiny. He could now explore another world, and discover new things, as he flew around in the land of the giants. If he was ready to grow back, he just had to wish for it. Life was great!</p>
