<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... it was obvious what had to be done next.<br />
<br />
Chuck Babcock was not his favorite among the group of Ron&#39;s friends. He reeked of the &quot;jock&quot; attitude and lived up to the standard bully stereotype. If you weren&#39;t as strong, as well-endowed and bullheaded as he was, then you were not a good enough man for him, and he let you know about it. There had been a couple times when he had called him out for his inability to bench 200, and coerced the rest of the crew to laugh with him - even Ron. Those types always aggravated me into believing I wasn&#39;t good enough. Why Ron always included him in these little get-togethers to talk football was confusing to me. So... wouldn&#39;t it be great to get back at him, in the most royal way possible? How could he give Chuck what he wanted, what he deserved, but in the most humiliating way possible?<br />
<br />
The Chronivac screen made an audible &#39;ding&#39; when I went back to the tool&#39;s screen - which still had cattle stats loaded, and an udder meshed onto Ron. I removed Ron&#39;s ID from the equation; the screen listed all possible candidates entered into the system, which included everyone in the apartment. Loading Chuck&#39;s profile took a bit of time, but then his stats appeared on the screen, and I nearly died when I read and found out he was secretly bisexual. He wouldn&#39;t want THAT to get out to the guys... or did they know already? If not, would they suddenly know already if a change took place? Would the system change their mindsets to believe he is &#39;out of the half-closet&#39;?? <br />
<br />
How deep was this system? The settings were currently in default mode. Everything that was changed seemed normal to the outside world except the controller of the Chronivac (myself). Could I change other little things about people in the process of a transformation? I was playing &#39;God&#39;, in a sense.<br />
<br />
I removed the udder from the equation by changing the sexual organs to male - so that instead of fusing another udder to Chuck, he would have the penis and balls of a mature male bull - at least, that&#39;s what the default age was. And I was definitely okay with that.... Oh, What&#39;s that, Chuck? I&#39;m not as &quot;well-endowed&quot; and &quot;bullheaded&quot; as you are? Well, NO, I&#39;m not!<br />
<br />
But... one day wasn&#39;t long enough.... it just wasn&#39;t, this time. No doubt, this machine worked, and it worked well. For the football game on Saturday, Chuck was going to have to contend with a huge bull&#39;s cock and balls. AND! I wanted to make sure <i> everybody </i> knew. But how? What good was it if everyone thought the change was normal? He didn&#39;t want to startle anyone here. Hmmm... Yes, this would be good... I&#39;d set the length of transformation for one week long, and changed the transformation sequence to occur in one minute so as to get this show on the road. But! Only the guys in this room and Chuck himself would think this change was normal, through some nifty proximity awareness settings. And, to add insult to injury, he&#39;d tinker with a few mental change settings for all the guys... it was all in place. For now. I laughed a bit with giddiness, and hit send.<br />
<br />
This time, though, a message popped up. &quot;Other changed candidates detected. Project change to all currently changed candidates?&quot; It was talking about Ron and his udder. Nooo... I think Ron could handle his bulbous endowment for a little bit longer. I clicked No.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sequence beginning in 5 .... 4 .... 3 .... 2....&quot;<br />
<br />
The change prompted the 3D image of Chuck to appear with his buff male package. Okay. I set down the device and walked out of my bedroom. It was time to go see the guys.<br />
_____________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark - pass me a soda.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve reached over to the box of cola and tossed him a can. With his wide receiver reflexes, he easily caught it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven pointer!&quot; Mark shouted.<br />
<br />
I walked into the room &quot;Six points, you doof.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who gives a shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s cool, dude, just leave him.&quot; said Ron, standing up for me. &quot;Need a drink, bro?&quot; Ron asked me, preparing to grasp a teat.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO?!!!? ... I mean, no. Just wanted to hang out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooookay well... we&#39;re done talking about &#39;ball, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
It had been about 15 seconds, and Chuck began to shift around in his lounge chair already. I sat down at the sofa across the room from him. He was wearing skin-tight jeans, and I could literally see the bulge of his manhood growing in his pants. He didn&#39;t seem to paying much attention to it though. He saw me staring at him a bit too intently, and he raised one of his eyebrows in disgust as I looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, why don&#39;t you just take a picture, it lasts longer - &quot;<br />
<br />
***RIIIIIIIIPPP***<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Chuck shouted.<br />
<br />
His jeans burst open, revealing a swollen chunk of bull-meat and increasingly large and fuzzy balls. It was still growing bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, Chuckie?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wore pants...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congrats there. We applaud your brilliance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no shit... Just, don&#39;t know why I wore <i> these </i> today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guys were clearly not phased. Nearing 40 seconds, Chuck&#39;s package had all but taken on a bovine shape - much more pointed and rosy pink, with short fuzzy furs covering his shaft and low-hanging testicles. Being the same proportion as a fully-grown bull cow, It probably took an entire hand to hold just one of his balls. <br />
<br />
The scene was shortening my rapid breath - it was all too much. As I had altered Chuck, I had also changed their mindsets so that they would be mentally okay with any change or affect that was as a result of his new package, which included - as he was now a bull where it counted most - his penis and balls being visibly open to everyone in the room. At least, it seemed, that&#39;s what the mental change was doing to his roomie&#39;s friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... well, what&#39;s a little bit of fresh air going to hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, we were talking about ordering a pizza,&quot; said Mark. &quot;What do you think - wanna pitch in with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chuck, you got the 50% off card - &quot; Steve had started to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I got it.&quot; Chuck said, getting up off the chair. Sixty seconds having passed, he stood to allow this package to &quot;drop&quot; - his balls swinging freely from his busted jeans, and his dick, very animal and very mature, but far too large on the body of a man even of Chuck&#39;s size. He stopped as he got up... his 16-inch bull&#39;s dick, fully erect. I began to wonder if this was actually &#39;cruel punishment&#39; for him or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, guys... I think I need to go relieve myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Never mind. It was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron set you off again, didn&#39;t he...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t help it, guys. Unless... one of you wants to help me out here...&quot; he said provocatively, stroking his shaft a couple times.<br />
<br />
Everyone in the room turned away in disgust. Well, that didn&#39;t change. I pretended to look away as well.<br />
<br />
After a trip to the bathroom, Chuck came back out to the living room, still slightly erect but with no desire to cover himself up. He got out his cellphone and called the nearest deli to place the order - Double pepperoni and sausage! <br />
<br />
&quot;Last name? Bullcock. Chuck Bullcock.&quot; he announced over the line, without a wink or question from any of his friends. I giggled at the successful mental change. &quot;No, that&#39;s really my last name!&quot; he yelled over the phone, insisting that they just move on and take his order. He finished placing the order and hung up the phone. &quot;Asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glory beheld, though, that Chuck would need to leave the apartment at some point or answer the door to the pizza delivery boy, and despite his normalcy with his new package in the apartment around his mentally-changed friends, there would definitely be a different reaction had by anyone else who saw him. It was this humiliation that he wanted Chuck to feel.<br />
<br />
Sitting there, chatting with Ron&#39;s friends, I wondered what would happen next... or what &#39;should happen next...</p>
