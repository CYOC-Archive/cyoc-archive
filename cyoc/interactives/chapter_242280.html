<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doorbell rang... I wonder who is it since all of us are in the house right now... I come out of my room, and look around. Tarydie is seemingly on the couch, not being productive as always. On the threadmills, There&#39;s Xyrde. He, I mean she is always taking care of herself. She does not seem to want to stop to answer the door.<br />
<br />
- Hey! Could someone answer the door please! I&#39;m in the middle of something here!<br />
<br />
That, that was S-Sylviana... It&#39;s not that I like her or anything. But only the sound of her voice is melody to my ears. She&#39;s so beautiful... A-anyway, since no one seems interested to go to the door, I guess I have to go...<br />
<br />
- H-hello... Oh, there a package...<br />
<br />
I thought someone would be there, but all there is is a small package. I looked all around it, in search of a name or address or name assigned to it, but it was completely bare. I closed the entrance door and advanced back into the appartment.<br />
<br />
- HA! You got yourself a new toy twerp? Be careful not to buy something too large for you!<br />
<br />
Tarydie had alway been mean to me. For some reason, she took me as a target for her constant teasing and bullying. The worst part, is that Tarydie saw me while I was... Well you know... Doing my “business” in front of a photo of Sylviana... So she has a trading chip if I don&#39;t do what she wants. <br />
<br />
- T-that&#39;s not it... It&#39;s not even mine!<br />
<br />
- Let me see that! We&#39;ll know for sure!<br />
<br />
She did not hesitate to take it from my arms and open the package.<br />
<br />
- Hey Xy! I think it&#39;s for you! It&#39;s a USB or something!<br />
<br />
- I *Huff* did not command any *Puff* USB.<br />
<br />
Xyrde had alway been the smartest of us all. At only 25, she has multiple diploma in a multitude of subjects. And as if it was not enough, she also had a great physical form, as she is often training to keep a good health. She, had the body of a guy... Or at least that what she said, because for real, there&#39;s nothing with her appearance that makes her looks like a guy or a girl. She could easily pass for both. She identifies as a girl though, so it&#39;s not hard to accomodate to her pronouns. I don&#39;t really know her that much, as she prefers to stay distant with others, and I prefer that too.<br />
<br />
- If it&#39;s not Xyrde&#39;s, it&#39;s probably some porn folders you ordered online?<br />
<br />
- S-stop it...<br />
<br />
And it&#39;s at this moment that Sylviana came into view, a hair brush in her hand, her hair half-way done correctly.<br />
<br />
- What is happening again? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re bothering Fey again?! I told you to stop it!<br />
<br />
Yep, Sylviana. She is always there to help people. She is caring, optimistic and sociable. Quite my contrary to say the least. Now she&#39;s standing  right next to me, holding her brush menacingly to Tarydie. Her hair, even messy are mesmerizing to see...Her hips are swayed in a perfect pose... Her C-cups jiggling right to good amount... Her waist is all... What was I saying? I&#39;m probably blushing... She nabbed the USB from Tarydie&#39;s hand and turned back to me. Her face is even more beautiful...<br />
<br />
- Here, is it yours?<br />
<br />
- H-hum yeah... thanks.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not really mine, but my mind was too blurry to contradict her...<br />
<br />
- Don&#39;t worry about it!<br />
<br />
She started walking back to her room, giving a death glare to Tarydie before closing the door. The bully also went back to the couch, but not without a grin glued to herself. I feel a dampness between my legs... Oh not again... I just have to look at her and... Oh my... I rushed to my room, closing it shut behind me, putting the USB on my desk and rushed to my bed. I didn&#39;t even take off my clothes and my hand was already plunging into my pussy. <br />
<br />
- She was so endearing... She is perfect... She is... I put another finger, and another, and another. Until four of them are exploring me. My mind is filled with Sylviana&#39;s features... It think I&#39;m going to...<br />
<br />
I orgasm once, liquid spurting out of my orifice, but I don&#39;t stop, not until I&#39;m satiated. When I finally pull my hand out, I must have came at least four times... I don&#39;t know why she has that effect on me... But I love it... I&#39;m breathing heavily when I get up to change my now messy clothes.<br />
<br />
After changing to a new pair of pants and not replacing my panties, I settle down at my desk. Inspecting the USB. It is labeled “Chronivac Version 4.0”. What should I do with it? It&#39;s not mine, and clearly not one of the other&#39;s either. I wonder what it contain... But I don&#39;t want any virus on my writing pc either, It&#39;s were I put all my work! My common sense was fighting my curiosity... But I had to know. I plugged it on my pc, and started the download... It took a few seconds, but it was now a strange application folder that showed up on my home page. I hesitantly clicked it, only yo be greeted with a welcome message.<br />
<br />
“Welcome new user to the newest version of Chronivac, the program who does it all! This software as the capabilities of changing and remodling the world around you! A few clicks and tweaks and your wishes will become reality! Be warned though, as any unwanted change or malfunction are not the fault of our company and we will not take any refound or return. Enjoy!”<br />
<br />
A program that could alter reality? I found that really hard to believe... According to it, I must start by pressing the scan button. I overed the mouse over it, and pressed. A blinding flash envelopped the room, making me squeel a bit. I reopened my eyes at the sight of a complete 3D model of me, and a incredible number of statistics and spectrum seemingly describing me. Is this think legit? I scrolled through a multitude of  numbers and settings. What would happen if she changed one? She finally stopped at the “Body hair” setting, for no reason in particular. It was written “Short hair covering legs, arms, and chest. Medium hair at armpits and genitals”. I decided to change it, just to test it out. I replaced the ancient message to “No body hair”. I looked as the 3D model lost all said body hair below the head, leaving only smooth skin. Suddenly, a prickling feeling overwhelmed me, and soon after, I saw all the hair of my body recedes. Leaving the same result than the Model.<br />
<br />
- Wow... this can&#39;t be real right?<br />
<br />
With trembling hands, I rubbed the skin right above my vagina. Where there was once a small bush, there was now only bare skin. This thing is for real. It works. I scrolled down a bit further, and stumbled into a section called, “change options”. It contained a few checkboxes, like “Target unaware” “User unaware” “Change reality” “Continuous change” All these types of things. There was also a “Direct input” section, this was the place were I could write anything, and it would change the corresponding settings. Should I try something out? Something that could not be changed by a simple number change? Quickly, I made sure that “User unaware” was unchecked and that “Change reality” was, I managed to collect my courage to type: “Target has a penis at the place of her clitoris”. I had always wanted to have the real thing, and not just some imitation that I was born with. I removed my pants, feverish about it. I look closely at my prothruding clitoris, which did not change for a long while. This was getting long... But suddenly, A wave of pleasure. My eyes rolled back at the new and strange feelings that just occured. I shook my head, and looked down, only to see a real penis hanging lowly between my legs. I hesitated before touching it. The delight that I felt at its touch made me understand, this was really mine. I looked under it, there were no balls attached, and my vagina was still visible.<br />
<br />
- That app is incredible!<br />
<br />
This was incredibly real. This program worked for real. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. I took back my pants and slide them around my legs, feeling a jolt when it brushed with my new appendage. <br />
<br />
- Hey are you okay in there? I heard some strange sound earlier and went to check?<br />
<br />
Sylviana&#39;s voice resonated into my mind as it came from the door. My penis immediately stiffening as I heard it. My first erection.<br />
<br />
- Hum... Y-yeah everything is well! D-don&#39;t worry about it!<br />
<br />
Her footsteps indicated that she did in fact go away. This gave me an idea, what if I tested this out on the others? This is extremely powerful, I could do anything to them. I could make Xyrde more sociable so that we could meet properly, I could take revenge on everything that Tarydie did to me, and I could... I could do so much with Sylviana... What should I do?</p>
