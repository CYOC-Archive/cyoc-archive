<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael Vantez was a student at the school, and he wished he wasn&#39;t. He was not a person who one would consider to be popular, but he wasn&#39;t a nerd, either. He never aced any of his classes, but he didn&#39;t fail any. He was an average student, an average person, and boy was he bored with it. <br />
<br />
He had a pretty big family, two other brothers, both a year older, and a twin sister. His parents were middle aged, but had permanently distanced themselves from their children by deciding to become clowns.<br />
<br />
He had been studying for a test in the school library, and while he was doing it he needed to use the bathroom. When he came back, he found a note sticking out of his backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; He muttered, placing it on the desk in front of him. It was a little note scratched onto a piece of paper. It looked like some kind of note, like the ones he saw kids pass around in class. He himself had never been into that sort of thing, only taking part in it to watch the teachers go ballistic when they saw it.<br />
<br />
But this note didn&#39;t look like a normal one. It wasn&#39;t a message, but some kind of survey. He wondered if someone was joking around, because from what he saw, some of the questions looked pretty ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Still, he didn&#39;t have anything else worth doing, so he opened it up all the way and began reading:<br />
<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so bored, just sitting there. Here&#39;s a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
Mike read on to the first question:<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was a girl?&quot; Mike said to himself, &quot;what kind of stupid question it that?&quot; That&#39;s an odd subject for somebody to ask about, especially from total strangers. Maybe some girls were trying to see what guys looked for in them? Regardless, <br />
<br />
<br />
But since this was better than studying, he decided to answer the questions. He dug out a pencil from his bag and began to write:<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be neat, but not really girly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like it, but it wouldn&#39;t be my favorite color.&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice that his writing was a lot nicer than normal, and pushed on to the next question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be somewhere between wavy and spiky, but not an excess of either. Just enough of both to look attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?<br />
<br />
&quot;Bright red. Dark turquoise would next.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
His hair, which was straight, curved and spiked in equal amount, falling onto his ears and forehead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Black, with the tips dyed bright red&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
He absentmindedly brushed the hair the hair from off his forehead with his hand. As he did so the color of his hair shifted from brown to black with the dye he had described. He was focused on the questions now, so he didn&#39;t notice his changes thus far<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
&quot;A light, ocean blue.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The color of his irises shifted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mike was beginning to describe the girl he wished would come into his life. He&#39;d be amazed if a girl like the one he envisioned existed, but the idea of being a girl was more than a little odd to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like make-up?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but not enough to be noticeable, just the right amount to show everyone how pretty I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
His face shifted and warped, becoming the face of the girl he was thinking of. A small amount of foundation, eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick. Just enough to make his face stand out as one that was hot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty?<br />
<br />
&quot;Somewhat. I&#39;d stay in shape. I&#39;d enjoy running and tennis, and ballet, and even though I haven&#39;t done it in a long time, I would still be very good at it&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
&quot;Not unless it&#39;s a formal occasion, and even then only if it was absolutely necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
His shoes remained the same, so he still he did not notice anything was wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes. I&#39;d be a tomboy, so I would usually wear pants. Today I&#39;d be wearing tight jeans that show off my cute butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
His pants didn&#39;t change much, just getting tighter, but his legs changed with him, so he remained oblivious.<br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but not a lot. I would have my ears pierced with diamond studs. I&#39;d wear a bracelet, and a necklace. I&#39;d also have a nose piercing in my right nostril, a small silver ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each piece of jewelry appeared on him, with piercings added as necessary, but for some reason he still remained oblivious of the changes.<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?<br />
<br />
This one was one he had been thinking about for a long time. He was about to put down his answer, when he noticed the feminine bracelet he had on his wrist.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Crap!&quot; Mike said to himself. He looked at his hand, then his eyes fell to his handwriting. He suddenly became aware of all that had changed. He glanced around, panicked, but there was no one nearby. As he turned his head he reached up to his hair, finding it to be the exact style he had wrote down.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe it! This survey thing couldn&#39;t do this, could it? But when he looked down again he. He had already begun to change. Frightened he contemplated just throwing the paper In the garbage, or tearing it up. Maybe he could find a way to go back to normal. He was glad he&#39;d figured it out before anything drastic happened. But he had no way of knowing what was going on, or if it was reversible. <br />
<br />
As he considered all of this, some writing appeared on the page:<br />
<br />
Do not stop. If you continue, your dream will come true. But if you stop, you will meet an unpleasant end.<br />
<br />
Mike gulped. He didn&#39;t know what kind of magic could be behind this test, but he didn&#39;t want to test its wrath. Plus, the note was right. This wasn&#39;t what he had had in mind when he found this thing, but it was a chance to be happy. Steeling himself, he made his decision. He decided to go forward with the questionnaire.<br />
<br />
He took a few deep breaths then put pencil to paper once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;B cup, and very round and perky.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
He looked down when he felt a tingle as two modest B cup breasts grew out of his chest. He couldn&#39;t believe it. It was really true! He touched his new breasts. He loved the feel of them. This is DEFINITELY better than taking a test. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mike smiled. He happily moved on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?<br />
<br />
Mike like girls, and had always liked girls. Even when thinking about being a woman he couldn&#39;t imagine not liking girls. So he wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be bisexual, but would mainly prefer girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to change, since there was really nobody in the library.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, because I&#39;d be genetically hairless on all of my body except my head, eyebrows, and eyelashes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hair disappeared from his body. His male package felt smoother than it had ever been before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?<br />
<br />
Mike knew what this question meant... And moved on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tampons.&quot; . His penis shrunk down and inverted itself with an odd squelch. Something shifted inside his pelvis, and Mike knew that now, for sure, he had become a girl. He was now a her, and her heart raced with excitement at the thought. She could feel the dampness between her legs, but she didn&#39;t want to take time out of the questionnaire to fully explore it now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 16: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be wearing the same thing I am now, but styled differently.&quot;<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t much change, just her white t-shirt getting tighter, along with her black GORILLAZ hoodie with the Plastic Beach album logo on it.<br />
<br />
It felt no different than before, but he didn&#39;t really mind<br />
<br />
She continued to write.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have no specific preference and would wear any of the above. I&#39;d tend to wear bikini or briefs most often. Sometimes I wouldn&#39;t wear anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her boxers morphed into a white bikini-style panty. It felt much better and more natural against her smooth lady parts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
<br />
She was not the best in her classes, so why not improve a bit?<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Waves of knowledge flowed into Mike&#39;s mind. She realized that some of her memories were being altered as she filled out the questions in order to fit her new self. They hadn&#39;t settled yet since the questionnaire wasn&#39;t complete but she was curious as to how she would turn out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;An ordinary white bra. Since my breasts are perky I don&#39;t always have to wear a bra, but I usually do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikes B cup breasts were suddenly cupped by a white bra. She felt more comfortable with that little bit of support, and she appreciated the way it helped amplify her cleavage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes? (Don&#39;t lie)<br />
<br />
Mike put some thought into this question. As her male self she was 15, a tall 6&#39;0&quot;, and an average weight at 145 lb. She decided on a few changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;15 years old. 5&#39;11&quot; without heels.&quot; She did a quick calculation in her head and wrote: &quot;134 pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Mike felt her vantage point drop a tiny bit as she shrunk an inch. Her stomach shrunk into a flat tummy and her clothes resized themselves to match. Her proportions shifted around; her waste got thinner and her hips got wider as her body took on a feminine shape. She felt more energetic than she usually did. <br />
<br />
<br />
Question 21: If you were a girl... what type of shoes are you wearing?<br />
<br />
She felt no need to change them, so she wrote down:<br />
<br />
&quot;I  am wearing grey hiking shoes. I have never been into shoes, and have a few pairs of shoes and boots.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s shoes didn&#39;t change, and neither did her memories.<br />
 <br />
Question 22: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t usually wear accessories beyond black fingerless gloves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gloves appeared on her hands. They felt comfortable to Mike.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 23: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
Mike was waiting for a question like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be short, just long enough to reach my chin. Additionally, my hair would be very soft but also strong and I would not have any problems with frizz or split ends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s hair grew out from her head, growing a small bit down to its intended length.<br />
<br />
<br />
She thought about how odd all this was, and how this new body was going to take some getting used to, but reminded herself that she wasn&#39;t that different from her old self. After gathering up her thoughts, she looked at the final question:<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 24: If you were a girl... what would your name be?<br />
 <br />
<br />
She considered a lot of different names, then finally decided that she wanted to stay close to her old name.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;My name would be Melissa Sagan, but my friends call me Mel or Mike.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to have a happy life as a woman, pass this on to the next person. Male or female, it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa folded up the note and dropped it in the locker closest to hers without belonging to anybody she knew, and then headed out. Her parents were going to be out late at a kids party, and she was going to hang out with her friends.</p>
