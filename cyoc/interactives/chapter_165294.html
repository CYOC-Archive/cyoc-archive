<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">October’s mother stood there, trying as hard as she could to resist the curse, but as a mortal her will was not strong enough. Her hands, like a magnet to another, were being pulled to the selection of 3 products.<br />
<br />
The Red Coloured Potion<br />
The Apple<br />
The Grey Coloured Potion<br />
<br />
Mandy forced her hand to the Apple. She would rather know what it’s going to taste like than something that could literally burn her tongue off. She tried to hold back but her hand moved it closer to her mouth. Her mouth forced itself open and she took a large bit of the Apple. As she moved her mouth from the Apple, she watched as the red colour drained from it, leaving it a dull grey colour. The Apple seemed to dry out in her hand, dissolving into nothing but dust as the breeze from the top of the stairwell blew it out of her hand. <br />
She chewed on the bite in her mouth. The Apple tasted... incredible.<br />
<br />
It was juicy, it was sweet but not too much, it was amazing. Mandy chewed on it for a few seconds longer before swallowing it. She felt it run down her throat, it was still amazing, the feeling of it. The perfect apple.<br />
<br />
She smiled, “that wasn’t so bad,” she said to herself. She picked up the glasses she was taking upstairs and made her way to the staircase. She continued to smile. Then she felt something on her tastebuds.<br />
Something bitter. Nothing awful, nothing making her cringe, but it contrasted so much with the perfect taste of the Apple. It was slightly jarring to her. She regained her senses and put one foot on the stairs. She stopped. She couldn’t make it any further. She just felt off all of a sudden. <br />
<br />
She stepped down, placed the glass bottles and glasses on a table and made her way to October’s large mirror on the wall. She looked at herself.<br />
Expecting to see herself a little pale, she was met with quite the opposite. She looked a little red. She saw her nose. It was a little rosy. She rubbed it, it didn’t change at all.<br />
<br />
She looked closer. She watched as the tip of it began to swell a little bit. That was weird. Was she having an allergic reaction. Her nose swells until it was round. It wasn’t as big as a clown’s nose but it was a little bigger. The size of maybe a grape or something.<br />
She poked it, it wasn’t soft, it was firm.<br />
She then realised, it was the Apple that did this.<br />
“Huh.” She pinched her nose again, “well that’s not too bad, I’m sure Sorin or October can...” she stopped. She felt something weird a little lower down. The same strange feeling. <br />
<br />
She lifted up her top, she looked at her belly. It didn’t look bigger, but around her belly button, it was red. The same shade that it was on her nose. She looked closer until he noticed her belly button was sticking out. She’d always had a belly button that stuck inward, even as she was pregnant it stuck in instead of out. She poked it. It felt weird. But it was firm, just like her nose.<br />
<br />
She looked over her body. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then she noticed her nipples. She didn’t pay much attention to them too often but they did look odd. She was wearing a bra but they seemed to poke out a little more than usual. She watched her shirt as they seemed to not only get harder, but also a little bigger. She lifted her shirt up and pulled her bra to look into and at her breasts. She saw her nipples. They were bigger alright. Not just bigger, but they were rounded. Something weird was definitely going on. But she didn’t have much time to think before she saw her face again. She looked at her eyes. They looked different. She took her glasses off. Her pupils were larger, and still growing. Their usual shade of emerald green was completely gone and replaced with a ruby coloured red. She couldn’t believe it. She watched as her eyes began to also increase a little. They grew bigger, her eye sockets growing with them. Her face began to look swollen. She saw her cheeks, they were rising. They expanded bigger, swelling larger and rounder. She watched as her ‘butt chin’ as her daughter called it, grew into two balls. As the parts of her grew and swelled, they gained that red colour. She looked at her hair. It was turning red. A darker red than her skin but a red none the less.<br />
<br />
Then she looked down. Her once flat belly was bigger. It was growing. It wasn’t growing fat but it was growing just like when she was pregnant. She looked two months pregnant, then three, then four. She placed her hand on it, in the mirror she saw her hands. Her fingers. They were swelling too. Each part was thicker than the last. Her palm was bigger too. Rounded almost. Nothing was flat on her anymore. She looked at her lips. They were getting circular. Larger and rounded and puffier. They were redder than her face but as red as her nipples.<br />
She looked to her thighs, they were thicker, not slim anymore. Her feet were growing out of her shoes. The ball of her foot was turning quite literal, as she slipped the shoes off, grabbed her socks and throwing them away. Each toe look like it’s own little ball of red. She looked back up. Her whole face was red, she looked down. Her belly was now the size of a basket ball. She looked at her butt. It was perfectly round but not perfectly shaped as it grew bigger and bigger. She turned back around to see that her breasts were now almost as round and getting bigger too. She watched as her whole body was grew. Each individual aspect of her rounded and became a sphere.<br />
<br />
Mandy looked back. It seemed like the change was over.<br />
Her body was completely red, from her hair to her belly.<br />
She looked down at her hips, they were completely round, her butt, each cheek was as big as a bowling ball and perfectly round. Her legs, her feet. Her arms, her fingers. Her face, her cheeks, round. Her whole head was round. Even her chin was now two red balls next to each other. Her breasts were the size of melons, they were sat on her huge belly.<br />
Her belly looked like she was pregnant. It was the size of a beach ball. It was bigger actually.<br />
<br />
She placed her hand on it. She felt it.<br />
It felt like skin, but underneath it didn’t, it felt... it felt like...<br />
<br />
“An Apple...”<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Mandy?” Sorin yelled from up the stairs, “Mandy you’ve been down here way longer than I though and I wanted to make sure you’re...” Sorin walked into the room. He took one look in and saw his wife. Or rather what looked like his wife, “Mandy?” He said,<br />
“Yeah,” she said, her breath was so strong it spread to Sorin, he could smell the sweetness and somehow the bitterness of the Apple from pretty far away.<br />
“What happened to...” he said, “I don’t know how I can fix this, how did this happen?” He said, his voice was panicked, “let me help you get upstairs,” he looked over her body. Everything was round. Even her tongue looked round. He looked at her one last time, then he noticed her head. Something was growing out the top of it. A green stem erected from the top of her head, leaves suddenly sprouted from it. On those leaves were what seemed to be little red dots that were growing pretty fast. <br />
Sorin grabbed his wife and lifted her up the stairs. Her body was firm and slightly uncomfortable, he couldn’t imagine what she was feeling like.<br />
They reached the top of the stairs.<br />
<br />
“OCTOBER!!” Sorin yelled.</p>
