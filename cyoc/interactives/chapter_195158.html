<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">30 minutes before Milo woke up, Sam was tossing and turning, feeling ridiculously uncomfortable. He had woken up around 6:30 and tried to go back to sleep for 30 minutes, but to no avail. Feeling defeated, Sam pulled his covers off his body and quietly slid out of bed. He looked over at Todd’s sleeping figure, and he couldn’t help but smile. <br />
<br />
After he’d had that heart to heart moment with Todd at the party, the two of them slipped out and went back to their dorm room. After that, they just…hung out. Todd had brought a TV with him to campus, so they looked for a good movie to watch. They didn’t end up paying attention to most of the movie, as they were too busy talking and joking with each other. Todd had opened up a lot more compared to that morning, and Sam couldn’t help but feel proud of him. <br />
<br />
Looking for some way to wake up, Sam decided that he’d take a shower. He went over to his dresser and pulled out a clean pair of clothes before grabbing his toiletries and walking down the hallway to the communal bathrooms. <br />
<br />
As he groggily walked past the bathroom mirror, something about his reflection caught Sam’s attention. He turned his head towards the mirror, and his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
While he mostly looked the same as he did yesterday, his hair had completely changed. It was much shorter than it used to be, and it’s color was now a snowy white. The hair on the back of his head had grown thicker, even sprouting on the back of his neck and stopping just below his shoulders. It was like a mane in a way. He ran a hand through his hair and quickly realized that it was no longer hair, but rather fur. <br />
<br />
The other major change was his ears. They had rounded out and moved to the top of his head. A thin layer of white fur coated them, with black fur at the tips. Sam noticed how they occasionally twitched and flattened, which made him chuckle a little. <br />
<br />
“Heh…I don’t look too bad…” Sam said to himself, flexing a bit in the mirror. Before he got too distracted, the man moved away from the mirror and went into the closest shower stall. He placed his toiletries on the folding bench inside the stall and stepped inside the shower. Quickly taking off his clothes, Sam turned on the shower and adjusted the temperature. Once it was at a tolerable temperature, the young man stepped under the flow of water and let it cascade down his naked body. Once his fur was wet, he reached into his toiletries basket and pulled out his shampoo…only to realize that it was completely different. <br />
<br />
“Shampoo for Felines?” Sam asked no one. He popped the bottle open and took a sniff…not too bad…<br />
<br />
He squirted a little bit into his palm and began to gently lather it into the fur on his head before moving to his tail. As he finished lathering his tail and fur, he stepped back into the water and let it rinse off his fur. <br />
<br />
As he rinsed himself, Sam closed his eyes and found himself fantasizing about Todd. What did he look like naked? What would he look like when he finished transforming? <br />
<br />
Sam’s hand began to migrate downwards…only to stop when he felt nothing there. Alarmed, he looked down, and…<br />
<br />
A sheath.<br />
<br />
His cock had become enveloped in a furry, white sheath. His balls, which appeared to have gotten a little bigger, had also been covered in soft, white fur. <br />
<br />
Curious, Sam sat down on the bench and began to gently rub his sheath, trying to stimulate his cock. After little effort, Sam’s newly transformed cock began to emerge from its sheath. The entire thing had taken on a reddish hue, and the head had become pointed. Sam watched as more and more of his cock came out of the sheath. Five inches, then six, then seven…eight….nine. <br />
<br />
“God damn…I’m huge…” Sam said, a dopey grin on his face. Gripping his cock, the young man shuddered in pleasure as he began rubbing his cock. The pleasure was so much more intense than it had ever been when he was a human. <br />
<br />
Sam grunted and closed his eyes as he jacked himself off. Images of Todd’s naked body flashed in his mind. He wanted more than anything to see the adorable young man on his knees sucking his cock. The fantasies were far too much for Sam to handle. Throwing his head back, the young man moaned as he came all over himself, shooting rope after rope of cum onto his abs. <br />
<br />
When the orgasm finally died down, Sam was panting and looking at the mess he’d made of himself. “Ha…ha…God…that was amazing…” he said to himself. He stood up and rinsed the cum off his abs. <br />
<br />
<I>“Maybe one day Todd would get to lick all that up one of these days,”</I> Sam thought to himself as he turned off the shower.</p>
