<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You turned your attention to the man at his computer, and sinply ordered Quetzalcoatl to stand by and watch. Your commands were absolute in the mind of the snake, and he turned back towards the human curiously to see what you were about to do. <br />
<br />
You took a deep breath and gathered up a small fraction of your divine energy and focused it all at the man sitting at the desk and started to hiss a relaxed and whimsical tune in your head. You in your mind you then started chanting in a beautiful singing voice,&quot;Oh dear mortal hear my voice~ You so oblivious due to bliss~&quot;<br />
<br />
The man paused and you saw him slowly turn his head and look you right in the eyes with a stricken look on his face. He didn’t even pay attention to Quetzalcoatl, who was still coiled around the pedestal you were on. &quot;H-Hello?&quot; He asked looking around the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could tell that he was connected with you mentally now, and you continued to chant,&quot;Oh one who claimed me as his own~ One with hair, arms, and without scales~ Look to me your illustrious goddess~ Hear my voice, see my form, and observe your goddess~&quot; <br />
<br />
The man turned back to you, and slowly stood up from his seat in awe at you. You then watched as he walked over to you and picked your pedestal up in his arms, and Quetzalcoatl loosened his grip around you and let the man do this. The man gulped now and examined your finely crafted features more intently, and he looked around again one last time before he asked,&quot;A-Am I dreaming?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response to this you continued your chant,&quot;He who holds me, know me well~ For you have shunned me, and taken me to the place in which you dwell~ You shall be punished, for your misdeeds, but gifted life in scales~ We shall a common likeness from our heads to our tails~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait what?!&quot; The man shouted then suddenly you locked his hands to your pedestal and made it so where he couldn’t let go of you, nor will himself to smash you. &quot;Human dignity so feeble and fragile~ Unlike Deities who find such things so degrading and vile~ Lose your rags, and become one with scales~ Then look down and reflect on your last moments amongst males~&quot;<br />
<br />
The man’s clothes vanished from sight and revealed yellowish light green scales covering his chest and stomach region. Then across his back emerged darker green scales that blended together beautifully in between as they continued to spread. Meanwhile the man&#39;s package started growing slowly smaller, and he looked down in horror and screamed,&quot;What?! No! Wait...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Foolish mortals should know their place~ Now you face your punishment, of my malice and hate~ But fear not for I do not wish you pain~ Besides you should be focused on your slimming frame~&quot; You hissed in your chant, slowly picking up the tempo to accelerate the pace of the changes.<br />
<br />
The man’s hips were growing wider at a steady pace, and his shoulders started narrowing at the same pace. His stomach grew slimmer too, but his muscles all but disappeared along his arms and legs. &quot;Wh-Why?! Why me?! What did I do to you?!&quot; He cried, as his manhood dwindled into a measily three inches, and you just figuratively rolled your eyes and continued with your tune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why fair human you mocked my pride~ Now you will have all the qualities equal to that of mine~ Your fur now pulls inwards, same for your manhood, your teeth, and humanity~ But fret not for you grow new claws, new hair, new fangs, new breasts, and femininity~&quot; You hummed to the human in your soothing whimsical voice.<br />
<br />
The human then cried,&quot;NOOO!&quot; Then he looked down and watched his cock retract into a plump, pink pussy between his legs. The scales were accelerating and so were the man’s changes with them, and he couldn’t take his hands off of you. Soon all of the hair on his body pulled into his pores, and each surface was replaced by soft glistening scales, all except for his head. The man’s face soon pushed out to form a blunt snout as his hair turned black, and out of each pore on his head was a long flowing strand of hair that grew down to his shoulders. <br />
<br />
The man screamed once more, and loudly as his tongue grew thinner and split at the end, and two giant fangs jutted out from the roof of his mouth and sprayed a thick stream of venom onto the floor. Meanwhile his nipples grew erect, as two firm FF cup breasts exploded from his chest and lactated causing him, now her to blush with embarrassment. &quot;Please, I-I’m sorry! I don’t deserve this!&quot; She cried, rolling each &quot;S&quot; sound for a couple seconds with a small lisp, and in a new cute high pitched womanly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh mortal I wish I could say that it wasn’t true, but you forced my hand~ Now you will learn a new way to travel on land~ Your legs feel stiff and merge to become strong~ A new tail for slithering on the ground, and both now move as one~&quot; You sang happily, and watched as the former human looked down at her legs.<br />
<br />
The two appendages merged together, and her feet disappeared with all evidence of them even existing in the first place. Then scales rapidly covered them and the new singular appendage started to grow. First it folded back towards the wall behind the new snakelike creature, and then coiled its way around every corner of the room. However it didn’t stop growing there and it pushed its way out into the main living room of the apartment with its length. The new serpent female looked distresed as she laid there, horrified beyond anything she experienced in her life. She then looked down at you as an elegant hood grew down the sides of her head and two holes formed in place of her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me that it’s over now, please, pretty please!&quot; She hissed distressfully and you smiled mentally and sang,&quot;Serpentine mistress please do not fret~ But my song isn’t finished just quite yet~ For you see since you enjoyed all those artificial plays of mating~ Know the reality of such things not just mentally but physically, in the making~ Let new brood, new eggs, new snakes grow and be born through your womb~ Then afterwards come to me for guidance, not to lustily succumb~ I am the goddess Ali-Nathair, ruler of reptiles, mother to you, and most fair~&quot;<br />
<br />
You closed your tune on that remark and the serpent woman&#39;s eyes widened, but then she groaned and lashed her head around. You freed one of her hands and she immediately clutched her stomach, and you looked down to see it swell tremendously, and bloat outwards dramatically. After this was done the woman appeared to be at the very least 9 months pregnant, and if not that then a couple months past that, if such a thing were possible for humans. She looked mortified, so you released her and allowed her to reflect on what you had done to her and the consequences that led up to this.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Quetzalcoatl stared at this wide-eyed, and you gave him the permission to slither down and comfort her if he wanted to. The male snake slowly made his way up her tail and coiled up next to your pedestal, which now sat idly and freely wrapped around the serpentine woman&#39;s massive tail, so he was up on her tail. You had decided to make her a cross breed between a cobra, like yourself, and a green anaconda, which was in the same family of snakes that Quetzalcoatl was a part of.<br />
<br />
The serpent woman seemed bewildered and confused more than anything and was in need of comfort, so you told Quetzalcoatl to go to her and he obeyed your without question. The average sized boa slowly made his way closer and closer to the serpent woman, and she noticed him and reached down to him. &quot;H-How did you g-get out of your enclosure b-big guy?&quot; She asked shyly, and Quetzalcoatl clithered up her arm and wrapped himself around the base of her hood, and nuzzled her neck gently.<br />
<br />
She blushed when this happened and gently stroked his head silently, and rubbed her enormously scalled belly slowly. You decided that you should make your presence known to her once more, but in a more peaceful manner so you hissed,&quot;Now I am satisfied with your punishment, dear disciple.&quot;<br />
<br />
The serpent woman looked up at you, blushing still and muttered,&quot;Y-You....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not as bad as you think, I promise, but I do not take too kindly to,&quot; You paused for a moment and cleared your throat as you read from the computer,&quot;Silithus moans uncontrollably, her juices spilles all over Taramion&#39;s thick and meaty loins. Taramion grins and doesn’t let up, all he wanted was to settle the rage within and hear his slithery bitch scream...&quot; You then paused for a few moments and said,&quot;You bought me because I looked like her too... didn’t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Ummm....&quot; She muttered and bit her lip and you hissed,&quot;Don’t lie to me, I always know my way around our kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The serpent woman sighed and said,&quot;Okay, okay... I might have... because you were maybe... exactly what I pictured her as in my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; You said sending a small jolt through the part of the tail your pedestal touched,&quot;As a small reward for admitting the error of your ways I shall give you a tiny gift of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The serpent girl shivered then you asked,&quot;Do you have anything to add, dear Quetzalcoatl?&quot;<br />
<br />
She then glanced down at her serpentine pet and he blinked twice and said to his owner,&quot;Your scales are so nice and smooth, and your jiggling squishy chest sacs are nice and warm. I want to be your mate, if you are in heat that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The serpent woman blushed, and you laughed as he nuzzled the woman more affectionately, and his twin dicks unsheathed. Mid Spring to late Summer was the mating season of boa constrictors, and you laughed remembering that Quetzalcoatl was a domestic snake, although still with natural instincts.<br />
<br />
You laughed as you heard this and said,&quot;Aww, what a cute little guy, he’s devoted as much to you almost as much as he is to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman blushed and stammered,&quot;B-But he... I-I’m... how w-would that e-even w-w-work?! I’m a-already... THIS,&quot; she gestured to her large belly and lactating breasts and hissed,&quot;I don’t know how this body works! I can’t go out in public! I don’t even know why I have tits this large!&quot; She then looked over at the computer and saw her friend online asking where she was in a message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Argh! Damnit, what do I do about that now?!&quot; She hissed and you paused and smiled at her and said,&quot;Have you two met somewhere that isn’t on an imaginary plane?&quot;<br />
<br />
The serpent woman paused and replied,&quot;N-No... w-why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about I offer you a deal to help improve your predicament? If you persuade him to meet you here then I’ll do something that will make your life a bit more favorable for you, and take care of that... other perverted imbecile.&quot; You replied proudly then added,&quot;But only, if you now devote your faith to me, mother to you and all reptiles.&quot;<br />
<br />
The serpent woman looked down at her body and sighed,&quot;Unless I wanna become a single mother to you know how many eggs, sure... I’ll do anything, my goddess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now go ahead, and perform your part for me and I’ll do mine as soon as you’re finished,&quot; You said and she nodded and looked down,&quot;F-First, can I uh... maybe look.... not pregnant? Just for a few moments, okay? I might have an... idea...&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed as you heard this and replied,&quot;Very well, but just as an illusion my child.&quot; You then pulsed another wave of energy through her tail, and suddenly her large belly turned back into a normal one, but only to the naked eye for it was still present for you.<br />
<br />
She then nodded and sighed,&quot;Okay how do I slithaaaargh!!&quot; She motioned off to the side of her bed and almost fell onto her stomach, but thankfully she caught herself and her stomach didn’t even touch the ground and she used her arm strength and flexted her torso up like a cobra up in front of her computer and sighed,&quot;Ugh, damn this really bites!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then sighed and started messaging the human on the other side, and she sighed a few times and stared at the screen unamused and said,&quot;Okay, looks like plan B after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The serpent woman then pulled up skype and started a video chat with the person, and as soon as his screen popped up he screamed at the sight of her. &quot;Told you handsome~&quot; She hissed seductively and the human on the other end almost fell backwards in his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what the hell kind of filter is this?! I thought you said your name was John, and... what the hell are you?!&quot; He screamed and she cupped both of her breasts and squished them together in front of the webcam and said,&quot;That was a typo on my end, but I just kind of decided to roll with it to make things less... awkward, heh, it’s actually Joan, as in Joanna.&quot; Joanna blushed pinching one of her nipples only for have a drop of milk fall down onto her keyboard, which made her blush even harder.<br />
<br />
The man peered back and said,&quot;What’s that long blankety green thing behind you?! Why... why do you look so much like my character from... you know?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s uh... me, I’m a pretty big to say the least, bigger than your character if you’re wondering. Also... I can’t really blame you for being insensitive, although I was born like I am,&quot; Joanna said then briefly glanced back at you then back at him,&quot;Can’t really go out in public as well... me, so I was wondering if you’d like to meet up for real at my place, it’s at least in a city if that makes you feel better about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa whoa whoa! What kind of witchcraft is this? You seriously can’t be... that can you, prove it!&quot; The man yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... are you into vore like my doppelgänger you have is?&quot; She asked flicking her tongue out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... and if I am...?&quot; The man on the other end asked blushing as Quetzalcoatl disappeared from view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a second,&quot; Joanna said with a hand on her stomach, reaching forward and untying a tie wrap binding most of the cable for the web cam together,&quot;...just gotta untie a cord here aaand... there!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then picked up the web cam as if it was a rat for Quetzalcoatl and muttered,&quot;Large ass jaw, don’t fail me now...&quot; Joanna then unhinged her jaw and slowly lowered in the camera into her throat and all you could see was a dark and fleshy abyss as she kept swallowing more and more of the cord as if it was a really long noodle. The man on the other end then said,&quot;Okay okay! I believe okay?! The name’s Max, damn... I’m so horny that a girl can actually do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, give meh a thec!&quot; Joanna said then she slowly pulled the cord up out of her throat and coughed a bit and sighed,&quot;Ugh, I need some water after that!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then did her best to clean the camera lens with her finger and said,&quot;That better?&quot; Then she set it back down and said,&quot;Not sure how deep my lady depth goes, but if things go well... how about we test that? That is... well... how big are you down there?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man on the other end picked up his webcam and pulled down his pants to reveal an erect 9 inch cock, and Joanna grinned and hissed,&quot;Oh that’s niiice.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then smiled and brought it back up to his face and asked,&quot;What’s your address? I’ll be out there as soon as I can! Hope you don’t mind if I end up staying a night or two if it’s long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem sweetheart, stay as long as you need to, it’s breeding season and I’m ready to have fun,&quot; She hissed then kissed the camera and told him the address of the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, got it! So... see you then?&quot; He asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you’re willing oh great beastly drake~&quot; Joanna hissed seductively and Max nodded and said,&quot;Heh, alright then deep-throat, catch you in a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then logged out and Joanna sighed and flopped back against part of her tail that leaned up against the side of her bed. &quot;Thank God!&quot; She hissed then you sighed and replied loudly,&quot;Ahem!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two of you watched as Joanna’s pregnant stomach became visible again and she sighed,&quot;Apologies, I need to adjust to this more, my goddess. So... I retract my last statement, thank you, Ali-Nathair, my goddess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, and I accept your apology, and give you forgiveness as my acolyte. Now, as a reward I’ll grant you one wish within my power, which can range from as large immortality to as small as earthly items. You’ll have time to ponder, besides you’re a proud mother now and you should respect that. Although I do wish I had at least a small shrine in your dwelling.&quot; You stated and she nodded,&quot;I’ll see what I can do, ugh... I’m starting to crave something... meaty. Fuck, am I actually wanting a rat right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, shoot for larger my dear, keep you and your eggs nice and full,&quot; You replied to her and she nodded and rubbee her stomach.<br />
<br />
Quetzalcoatl then slithered up to you and asked,&quot;Can I be of some assistance in exchange for prey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not now please Quetzalcoatl, I’ll get you something soon! Please don’t ask our goddess for something so small... at least when I could just get it for you.&quot; Joanna hissed then she looked to your pedestal and said,&quot;I think I know what I want to wish for.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave her your attention and said,&quot;As long as it doesn’t reverse your punishment it’s fine with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then nodded to you and said,&quot;I wish....&quot;</p>
