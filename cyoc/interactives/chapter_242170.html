<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Contains explicit merge, slight body horror and anatomical changes.<br/>
<br/>
Also might do other branches related to merging similar to this if feel like it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You see Jeff, I got really curious with your little program and discovered something wonderful, now I can change reality at my will just by talking!” Aubrey mischievously smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff sweated a little getting worried about his childhood friend, she wouldn’t hurt him… right? “That’s cool Aubrey haha… b-but you should return to normal later, you know, it could be dangerous to have that kind of powers for too long” he tried to convince her.<br />
<br />
“Nonsense!” Aubrey made a fist with one of her hands filed with anger, “this world is filled with many horrible people! You have seen them, the ones that bullied me since we were kids, bad teachers, my parents…” she expressed all her frustration and resentment of how people treated her through her whole life. “And the worst part… you never did anything against that” she pierced Jeff with her sight, making him even more scared.<br />
<br />
“Look, Aubrey, this isn’t what it you think-“ <br />
<br />
“Silence” Aubrey spoke, making Jeff feel like if his lips were glued. She then gained her smile back, “I have bigger plans for you, so don’t move”<br />
<br />
Jeff again felt his whole body rigid again, looking at his childhood friend approach him. “I am now a powerful being, one better than a human… so I need a new improved form and you will help me with that!” She laughed while Jeff looked in despair, wondering what evil plan ahead had now.<br />
<br />
“First remove your clothes” Aubrey crossed her arms staring at Jeff, grinning as he undressed against his own will, she did the same without saying a word. “Now you will stand on all fours” Jeff lowered his body, standing like a dog like if he was about to crawl. Aubrey moved really close to him, positioning herself with her legs on the sides of Jeff’s neck and her crotch having his head in front of her.<br />
<br />
“Now we can start with the interesting parts! Your hands will merge with my feet once I step on them, then your arms will fuse with my legs” she said as she slowly steeped on Jeff’s fingers, watching and feeling them combine like their bodies melting to shape a new form, then as she previously said his arms fused with her legs into a single pair of limbs like if it was clay being reshaped. <br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a muffled scream when he feels and watches as his hand merges with Aubrey’s foot, and as his bones and nerves in his hand adjust and fuse with her bones and nerves, Jeff feels a sharp pain in his hand. This torture repeats itself when she steps onto Jeff’s left hand, soon both of Jeff’s hands have literally become Aubrey’s feet.<br />
<br />
Aubrey giggles, wriggling her frontal toes, “that felt really good, I know it did feel good for you too, Jeff,” she says, looking down at Jeff’s hear with a smile, “I can tell how excited you are, I hope you’re enjoying this as much as me hehe” she said as she stretched her frontal legs fused with Jeff’s arms but still she wasn’t fully in control of her lower body… yet.<br />
<br />
“Now my waist will merge with the your shoulders as my ass blends with the rest of your back. My tailbone will connect with your column as the rest of our bones and nerves connect correctly, letting me control all my lower body” Aubrey bit her lips, feeling how her internal anatomy drastically changed but didn’t feel a single drop of pain, instead the process was totally pleasurable, you could even hear how the bones clicked and flesh rearranged to complete her desired form.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t feel the same, instead he felt every single morph in their shared body, being transformed and manipulated against his will, he wanted to scream, yell at her but he just simply couldn’t even with all of his strength due his “friend’s” absolute power. Jeff even wondered if she was really always like that, a devilish woman lacking empathy or was the power that corrupted her, most likely the first one after hearing her tragic story of vengeance and that program was her key to make her plan become true.<br />
<br />
Aubrey now in total control of her lower human-tauric body decided to walk around the room with her new “steed”, she immediately got used to the feeling and was impressed of how fast she could get, she smiled noticing that things were just getting better. Aubrey stopped, feeling the heart of Jeff beating like a race horse in her lower body. “Hehe you’re excited don’t you?” She kept teasing him, knowing that he was everything but excited, just covered in terror and anxiety. “My lower body doesn’t need that, doesn’t even need organs as I have mine in my upper body!” As she spoke the changes occurred, Jeff’s heart, lungs, liver, stomach and other vital organs disappeared in the blink of an eye, with the only exception that Aubrey’s bowels connected with Jeff’s, becoming a large intestinal track that ended in Jeff’s anus, that caused Aubrey’s stomach getting even bigger.<br />
<br />
The nervous connections were finishing to merge, Aubrey could now feel how hard Jeff’s penis turned after she got in control of it, pumped by her lustful desires. At the same time she felt his… HER anus twitch a little of excitement.<br />
<br />
“Now no one can separate you from me! Your entire life depends on me for the rest of your days! Isn’t that excited Jeffy? We’re closer than ever~” she looked down caressing Jeff’s head between her legs, he wanted to cry but Aubrey didn’t even let him do that, just hold the pain the whole situation caused him. “Oh don’t worry, we still have one final change!” She removed her hands from his head.<br />
<br />
“Now for the final part, your head will bend backwards and you will shove it all inside my pussy, my insides will stretch to be able to handle anything” she giggled and moaned just by speaking. Jeff unwillingly obeyed, his head moved backwards ready for his fate, the top of it was being slowly introduced, Aubrey’s wet vagina emitting slimy sounds as his head penetrated her. It almost looked like her vagina was alive by how it swallowed Jeff, she decided to rub her clit to make the experience even better. Jeff was introducing the rest, his head being surrounded by a slimy and warm meat prison until he was fully inside. <br />
<br />
“Oh my~” Aubrey moaned looking down no longer seeing Jeff’s head but rather a bit of his neck inside of her, having a massive bulge below her belly containing Jeff’s complete head. “Now another pussy will appear in my lower body, placed between MY cock and anus, your mouth will merge with my womb and bladder as your throat will connect with the pussy of my lower body, making your eyes, hair, nose and ears disappear as the rest of your head fuses with my vaginal walls.”<br />
<br />
That was the end of Jeff, his head was extended with the reproductive organ of Aubrey, dissolving what was left of his humanity. Now he could no longer see and smell, but Aubrey let him keep his hearing despite not having ears, and he could still taste everything that came from Aubrey’s womb and bladder as his mouth was forced open to fuse with them, while he felt every minuscule change she did to their shared body. Jeff’s transformation finished as his throat became the bridge between the bladder, womb, and the pussy that grew in the lower body, ripping and opening some flesh in order to appear. Despite being merged into that amalgam Jeff was still conscious the whole time, his brain was still intact, trapped inside Aubrey’s new lower body.<br />
<br />
Aubrey smiled patting her crotch as her vaginal lips fully merged with Jeff’s neck. She felt proud of her masterful body craft, just by thinking on it she felt her new pussy getting wet and her new cock getting really hard. “Don’t worry, we have more work left to do hehe~” Aubrey walked around with her improved body, ready to “correct” the world as her vision, while Jeff was reduced to a slave of her body with his identity stolen. “Everyone will think I look normal like this, I can be fully naked outside without people thinking it’s strange and everyone will still remember Jeff, unaware of what happened to him” Aubrey said as she felt a change in the atmosphere, smiling knowing reality was in total control of her.</p>
