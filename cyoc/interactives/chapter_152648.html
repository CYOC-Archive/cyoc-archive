<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She had no choice.  If she didn&#39;t kill him, she&#39;d be the one ending up dead.  She selected the kill option, and reality unfroze.  She didn&#39;t quite expect how different she&#39;d feel as the dark alignment points hit, though.  Her alignment was now -54 and had the word &quot;Dark&quot; in parenthesis next to it.  She suddenly didn&#39;t care about having to kill him at all.  She started to charge a fireball, but...no, the noise and light might attract others.  She&#39;d do this the other way, the way that she was suddenly starting to think of as the fun way.  She smiled at him as she unzipped her sorceress&#39;s robe from the front.  His eyes bulged as her ample breasts spilled out before him.  His lust was evident, but so was his fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t give in, succubus!&quot;  he cried.  <br />
<br />
She only smiled more as she continued to slowly unzip herself, until at last her garment dropped and she stood naked.  &quot;Oh, I think you will.&quot; she said.  She began to prowl closer to her prey.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  Your charms won&#39;t work on me!&quot;  he said, but the growing bulge in his pants was evident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my dear, I haven&#39;t even started using Charm yet.&quot;  <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t seem she&#39;d have to.  As she pressed her breasts into him and batted her eyes, her hand snuck down to massage his bulge, and she knew he just needed to relax and she&#39;d have him.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, dear, I don&#39;t want your soul tonight.  I just want to be fucked.  A girl has needs you know.&quot;  It was a lie of course, but it was a lie that he was growing horny enough to believe.  He tried several protests amidst groans of pleasure as she freed his cock from his pants.  &quot;You&#39;re clearly thinking the with wrong head, dearie,&quot; she said, &quot;but at least your big beautiful head downstairs is thinking straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I can&#39;t.&quot;  he muttered.<br />
<br />
She was growing frustrated.  &quot;Look, this isn&#39;t complicated.  I&#39;m a horny little slut, and you&#39;re a big hard man. So Fuck. Me. Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
At last he gave in, and with a growl he grabbed her and pushed her against the wall.  &quot;You&#39;re mine, whore.&quot;  he said as he thrust inside of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; she cried out as she relished the glorious feeling of manhood penetrating her, &quot;That&#39;s the way!  Give it to me!  FUCK ME!&quot;  He pounded away at her, and for a moment, she just enjoyed the fucking, and let him enjoy it.  He deserved a little pleasure before he died, after all.  Then she started to drain him and his HP dropped.  She chose to convert it to XP instead of MP this time.  When it dropped again, he realized what was happening, and tried to pull away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; she said as her eyes flared with Charm.  &quot;You&#39;re mine.  Now be a good boy and fuck me till I&#39;ve got everything you can give.&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes glazed over and he went at her with renewed vigor.  She moaned in mounting pleasure.  Soon they came together, her first orgasm from sex in human form, his last orgasm ever. He dropped to the ground.  She smiled as her hand went to her pussy.  It was still trembling from her orgasm, and dripping cum.  She squeezed her legs to hold the cum in, and brought her fingers to her lips to taste the bit that had already dripped on her hand.  Delicious.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the body.  It was probably best just to get out of there quickly before she could be associated with it.  If she were spotted she&#39;d just claim he&#39;d had a heart attack while raping her.  She put her clothes back on, took the thief&#39;s gold, and quickly made her escape.<br />
<br />
Once she was a safe distance away, she noticed that she&#39;d leveled Charm and Soul Drain to lv 2.  That gave her 2 uses of Charm per day, and Soul Drain now worked faster and could give more MP.  In addition, killing the level 3 Bandit, plus Soul Draining him, plus the 300XP progress award for the choice, had gotten her to level 4.  She didn&#39;t get the Unworldly Beauty bonus this time.  She thought deeply about what to put her points in to.  She&#39;d wanted to be a sorceress before but...more and more the benefits of charisma and seduction were becoming clear, and she certainly didn&#39;t mind sex anymore.<br />
<br />
At last she made up her mind, and put the points into charisma.  Then she remembered that the Key Choice message had said something about evolving?  She pulled up the help screen and looked it up.  Apparently at level 5 she could choose a special evolutionary path. <br />
 Since she was so dark now, she&#39;d have to choose between the Enthraller and the Devourer? hmm(Note: if you want to see all the options and their descriptions, look up a chapter in another branch called &quot;Species Evolutions?&quot;).<br />
<br />
She wanted to evolve now, so she rushed to the market and bought and XP potion.  It brought her budget back down to the red, but that was fine as long as she had enough to sleep tonight.  She&#39;d make more money with the party tomorrow.<br />
<br />
She downed the potion, enhanced her Charisma again, and chose...</p>
