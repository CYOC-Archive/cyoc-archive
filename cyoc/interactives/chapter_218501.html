<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Maisy could finally tell Rachel that she was the daughter of the devil and that her father was now demanding that either she return with her new partner soon to be wife to the court of the underworld or she return anyhow and her partner ends up dead. <br />
<br />
What most people didn’t understand about heaven and hell is that in the end most people end up in both places.<br />
<br />
Everyone, goes to hell aside from the best of the best people and aside from the worst of the worst people go will end up in heaven. <br />
<br />
The best way, Maisy could explain it in a human way is that Hell was like a prison for sin and everyone sins. <br />
<br />
The more sins one does while on Earth the longer a person stay is and the type of sin one does determines the level of hell a person ends up on. <br />
<br />
The 1st level, which is the largest has the most damned souls but has the highest turn over rate as the souls which have spent their time in hell and now has earned the right to be reborn to try again or go to heaven reside. The deeper one goes down into the 9 levels of Hell the worst a person soul is and the worse the punishment and the longer the stay. <br />
<br />
That lead to a very embarrassing event with one of her older brothers, he had gone to earth to find love in what the humans call the dark ages. He found it and once he revealed who he was, he foolishly gave her time to consider. The women he loved rejected him and called the entire town to face the devil. He had run, but the women had been burned for having courted the devil and ended up in hell where he now ruled over her soul and was in charge of punishing her for her sins.<br />
<br />
Maisy couldn’t remember if that woman&#39;s soul was still there or not, maybe she will ask him next time she saw him. <br />
<br />
“Rachel, there is something I need to talk to you about.” Said Maisy as the two of them stood in the bedroom together. <br />
<br />
“Sure, what is it?” said Rachel as Maisy took a breath and prepared herself.<br />
<br />
Before she could do anything, however, there was a ring of the doorbell.<br />
<br />
“Who is it?” inquired Rachel as she left the bedroom and walked toward the front door of the apartment they shared. <br />
<br />
It was a normal apartment one would expect for a starting couple, a small hallway led back toward the single bedroom with a tiny ass kitchen and a living room/dinning room attached. <br />
<br />
Sitting on the edge of the couch watching Rachel head toward the door, was a small black and white cat which looked at Maisy. It looked like a normal cat, but that was Maisy’s personal cat meaning that the cat was from hell, it wasn’t just a pet but a protector as well but the worst it had done so far was kill a couple of birds when she had gotten loss.<br />
<br />
“Hello, can I help you?” inquired Rachel as she opened the door.<br />
<br />
Standing in the doorway, was a breathtaking beautiful woman in her mid to late-40’s but beautiful enough to make super models and actress jealous and insecure. Her long black hair was slickly smooth and her eyes were dark yet warm as well.  She wore a semi modest blouse with a very deep V cut which would have shown off her impressive rack but it was covered with a thin semi see through mess. Her blue jeans looked normal but hugged her lines in a way to cause others to wish they would come off so that they could see her true body. <br />
<br />
“Hello, is this…” started the women before she noticed Maisy standing behind Rachel. “Maisy how are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Mom?” inquired Maisy, she couldn’t hide her smile. <br />
<br />
“Didn’t your father tell you I was coming by?” inquired her mom<br />
<br />
“No.” said Maisy as the Queen of Hell shook her head in a sign of frustration. <br />
<br />
“That man, can manage so many things but he seams to always forget the small things.” Said her mom before looking at Rachel in more detail. Before offering her hand. “Hello, I am Lily Morgenstern.”<br />
<br />
“Hello, I am so happy to meet you, Mrs. Morgenstern.” Said Rachel as she took Maisy’s mother hand.<br />
<br />
“Please, call me Lily, I heard you are likely to be my next daughter-in-law and all of them call them by first name when among family.” Said Lily Morgenstern with a warm smile.  <br />
<br />
That was true, she did demand that all her sons and daughters in law demand that all of them call them by her first name while outside of the court itself. When the Queen of Hell was in the official court or carrying out courtly business she was to be called her majesty even by her family members. Outside of that her name was Lilith Morningstar and she demanded everyone in her family call her that. <br />
<br />
“Well come on in.” said Rachel as Lilith walked in and almost instantly was embraced by her daughter in a deep and loving hug.<br />
<br />
“Oh…my little devil, I have missed you.” Said Lily as Maisy smiled at her childhood nickname.<br />
<br />
“Little devil?” inquired Rachel somewhat confused as mother and daughter pulled apart. Standing side by side, from Rachel’s point of view they did look related by Lily looked far sexier and better looking then Maisy but that was because Maisy had chosen to look less sexy to find true love while her mother had found it near the dawn the time itself.<br />
<br />
“Oh…this one caused so many issues for me and the staff growing up.” Laughed Lily “Dan, can’t wait to see you, you know you were always his favorite growing up.”<br />
<br />
“Dan?” inquired Rachel<br />
<br />
“My father’s long term business partner and basically family.” Said Maisy, not adding that Dan was a actual Death himself or sometimes call the Grimm Reaper. “Mom why are you here?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you heard your father, it is time to come home and to bring your partner to meet us all.” said Lily <br />
<br />
“I would love to come meet your family Maisy; you always seem to hide things about them.” Stated Rachel.<br />
<br />
“Well, that is because our family has a little bit of a secret we like to hide.” Explained Maisy as Rachel chuckled. “And the court can be a very intimidating place.”<br />
<br />
“Court? what are you guys royalty or something? I am dating a princess of some small country no one has ever heard of?” inquired Rachel with a laugh. “Am I in a hallmark movie or something?”<br />
<br />
“Well, that isn’t totally wrong.” Said Maisy as Rachel’s eyes widened in shock. “Maybe we should sit down.”<br />
<br />
“We need to sit down.” Confirmed Lily</p>
