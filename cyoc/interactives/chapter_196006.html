<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, you sleepily walk into the bathroom while Brooke sleeps in. You undress and sit down on the toilet to pee and check your phone for a minute before you hop into the shower. About halfway through your cleaning, you notice something about you feels just a tad... off. You sleepily examine yourself a little. You feel like you may have lost a bit of weight, but you can&#39;t say for certain. <br />
<br />
You begin cleaning your crotch when the soap bar vanishes from your hands. You look around for it, but cannot find it anywhere. Then you remember exactly where it is and chuckle. You remove the soap from your storage and more carefully clean around it.<br />
<br />
It is weird. You obviously never had a pussy before, but you are certain that this must be how having one feels. You want to try out something and grab one of Brooke&#39;s thinner bottles of product. With a firm grip you slowly move it towards your pussy. You feel the suction force grab it, but manage to hold on to it and only let some of it in.<br />
<br />
You gasp and let go of it as your legs grow weak all of a sudden. &quot;Woah...&quot; You fish it back out and try it again, now expecting the same feeling and preparing for it. Sure enough, the moment you are in range, it gets sucked in until your ha d stops it. The feeling is orgasmic and you hold out for as long as possible as you being yourself fully to orgasm after only 4 seconds of this pass. You power through your load and keep a firm grip on the bottle. Not 10 seconds after your first orgasm, you cum again. Then again only after 7 seconds, then 4, Then the delay vanishes and your cock it just pumping out cum until it runs dry and you are left with only the feeling. <br />
<br />
You notice your hand holding the bottle also is quite gooey now and realize that you not only came from your dick, but also from the pussy portal. The pleasure is melting your mind now, so you let go of the bottle, feeling it land inside your storage and bounce a few times before settling down on the floor. You are now gasping for air as you were so overwhelmed with pleasure that for the whole time, you couldn&#39;t even focus enough to breath normally.<br />
<br />
Your cock is fully limp now and your balls have never felt more spent. And yet your pussy is only begging for more. So you sit down and spread your legs apart. With a hand, you slowly bring a finger to your pussy and slowly stick it inside. You gasp and have to stifle a moan as it feels really good. You begin fingering yourself some more, reawakening your sleeping dick only to blow another empty load rather soon after. You still leak quite a bit from your pussy though.<br />
<br />
You finish up after another orgasm and exit the shower feeling very satisfied as a man, but your pussy is still rather horny. But it too seems to be calming down, although slowly. You towel up and walk back into the bedroom. You quickly sneak a pair of Brooke&#39;s panties before putting on a pair of shorts and a tshirt. <br />
<br />
Once dressed you head to the kitchen for some food. You open the fridge and rummage through it, grabbing a few ingredients. You plan on making a few eggs for both of you and begin cooking. You prepare 3 eggs for each of you, and on a whim, toss the remaining 6 eggs into your storage. You finish the eggs and set out a plate for each of you on the table just as Brooke sleepily walks out of the bedroom, only wrapped in her oversized fluffy robe. The robe is certainly warm, having owned it before giving it to her. But it was just too fluffy for your liking and we&#39;re fine parting with it since she liked it so much. <br />
<br />
It is now your favorite piece of clothing since Brooke only sleeps naked, and is super lazy in the morning. This means that underneath that robe is nothing but her naked body. And the fact that she doesn&#39;t bother tying the belt and lets the front hang open a little bit is why you love it. Brooke begins eating with you and after a few sips of coffee, begins looking at you weirdly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; You ask, noticing her puzzled look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look, better. Like, did you maybe lose some weight? And your skin looks really great today too for some reason... like, not as rough or something. Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, as this isn&#39;t a bad thing or anything. But you just look, better today than usual&quot; says Brooke as nicely as possible. &quot;But I will say, you do look good cleanly shaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause at this. You realize finally what has been bugging you. You facial hair is gone. You never had a huge beard or anything, but the one you have had for some time now is completely gone from your face. You are kind of weirded out by this. You don&#39;t remember shaving at least. &quot;Uh.. thanks&quot; is all you can say. You figure she somehow did it to you in your sleep as a prank since she brought it up so nonchalantly and leave it at that.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, you kiss Brooke on her forehead and get your shoes on for your morning jog. While on your jog, you find that your shorts feel a little bit looser than usual, which means that you must be finally trimming off those few extra pounds you had gained sometime a while back.<br />
<br />
A jogging couple pass you by and you can&#39;t help but notice the girl&#39;s large rack bouncing just a bit within her sports bra. However you then find yourself checking the guy&#39;s crotch out too in order to see if he had a bulge or not. You quickly stop once you catch yourself and desperately try to think of anything else. <br />
<br />
&#39;Why the fuck did you just check out a guy?&#39; This thought is not in your head and you keep thinking back to what you saw. He did have one. And it made you excited a bit. Well, it made your pussy excited at least. You not so much. <br />
<br />
You quickly end your jog early and go back home, having not even broken a sweat today. At home, you ask Brooke where she put the pussy portal and she says it is in the trash in the bedroom. You are glad that she forgot that you took it from her and had just thrown away the empty box. You fish it out and look at it. <br />
<br />
After reading all sides, you find nothing out of the unexpected at least and set it down. You go into the bathroom and bend over in front of the mirror with your leg on the toilet. To your surprise, the pussy portal looks a little different than how it did earlier. It doesn&#39;t look fake at all. You try to find a seam or somewhere to pull it off and actually fail to do so.<br />
<br />
Now with a much bigger concern, you go back to the box and look inside. There is a small packet of paper which you quickly look through. There, right in big bold letters, you find it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Caution! This is not a lite version of the Pussy Portal. Be sure to wear only for at most 12 hours if you only desire it for temporary useage. After spending more than 12 hours of continuous useage, the Pussy Portal will merge with you permanently. Permanent merging may include some side effects such as, cronic monthly moodiness, increase in libido, an varying level of attraction towards the male sex, feminization, and in rare cases even futanari syndrome. Contact your local retailer if you have a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your feel your heart sink. Permanently merged. Meaning that this isn&#39;t a pussy portal anymore. Now it is just your actual pussy, that happens to also have a portal inside it. You have a genuine pussy now. And it is permanent too. And thinking back, you must be having a few of the other side effects as well. This explains why you were checking out that guy earlier. And why you feel thinner and lighter. It is possibly why your facial hair is now gone too.<br />
<br />
You get dressed again and take the box with you. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to go back to find that store for a bit.&quot; You nervously say to Brooke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Good idea, let me get dressed and I&#39;ll go with you. I want my 10$ back. Maybe I can still return it since I harldy used it and am not satisfied.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No need! I mean, we did use it. So probably they won&#39;t want it back.&quot; You quickly say. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way. Well, I&#39;m at least gonna go and try. Just wait a second.&quot; She quickly leaves and 10 minutes later walks out in some casual clothes with her bag. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, listen, I don&#39;t know if we can&#39;t return it. I kind of, well, used it. And now it is uh... stuck&quot; you embarrasingly admit. As expected Brooke laughs at this and calls your bluff. She jokingly puts her hand in your crotch to test your claim but gets sucked inside the portal. <br />
<br />
You feel as if you&#39;re going to vomit as she starts moving around. Then you feel something attach to her and it gets even worse. You can only imagine that this must be how pregnant women feel only without the actual pregnancy. As you have first hand experience being inside the portal, you guess that what&#39;s happening here is that your body basically hooks an umbilical cord up to anyone who enters inside the portal. Possibly intentionally designed to function like this as a safety measure incase someone need to leave someone else inside their portal for an extended period of time or something.<br />
<br />
But in seconds, Brooke escapes your portal storage and appears in front of you wide eyed with the most shocked look on her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; She says slowly. Then &quot;ow&quot; as the cord disconnects with a pinch and retracts back inside the portal. &quot;Oh my god! You are serious. You are using it.&quot; Then her shocked expression begins to crack into a huge smile. &quot;And did you steal my fucking panties too! Haha! Oh my god this is fucking hilarious! Come here, let me see it!&quot; She says and drops to her knees while pulling down your pants as well. &quot;Holy, um... Hey, we have to go see that guy right now. Something isn&#39;t right here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am aware. It merged with me. Let&#39;s go now just in case we have a limited window of time to act.&quot; You say impatiently. Brooke nods and hurries along with you back to the store.</p>
