<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You're not 100% sure what's going on, but the girl obviously needs help, and the man whoever he is is obviously scum. You know the perfect way to end this.<br />
<br />
You remove the Book of Beast from your bag, and open it while watching the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shape!&quot; You whisper while pointing at him, and picturing a rat.<br />
<br />
The spell hits, and in a poof of smoke, the gray book and former clothes of the man fall to the ground, and land on top of a very confused rat. The rat looks around, probaly trying to figure out why everything seems so much bigger. He doesn't seem very smart. Eventually, he runs off, to start his new life as a rat.<br />
<br />
Well the girl is safe not, but there's still one thing you're curious about. You walk over and pick up the book that the man had dropped, and picked it up and opened it.<br />
<br />
It's the Book of Body!<br />
<br />
The spells listed in it are:<br />
<br />
<br />
I. Muscle Growth<br />

The command word for this spell is ‘muscle’ and the spell consumes only a minor amount of energy.<br />

This spell requires only a minor amount of energy to use.<br />
<br />

III. Growth<br />
This spell allows you to increase one’s size. The size you increase one to has no limits, but the spell will require more energy for more extreme changes. The command word is ‘growth’ and to activate the spell speak the command word, and focus on how large you want the target to be while pointing at the target. If no target is selected, then the spell will affect the caster only. This spell requires a mild amount of energy to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
IV. Shrink<br />
This spell allows you to decrease one’s size. The size you decrease one to has no limits, but the spell will require more energy for more extreme changes.

If no target is selected, the spell will affect only the caster. This spell requires a mild amount of energy to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
V. Weight Loss<br />
This spell allows you to cause one to loose weight without affecting their size. As a result, you can make someone who looks quite heavy and muscular light as a feather with this spell. The spell’s command word is ‘loss’ and it requires only a mild amount of energy. To activate the spell, speak the command word, and point at the target, while thinking of the new weight. If no target is selected, you become the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
VI. Weight Gain<br />
This spell is the opposite of weight loss. With this one you can make a target weight more without affecting their size. As a result, you can make someone who looks short and light weigh several tons. The spell’s command word is ‘gain’ and it requires only a mild amount of energy. To activate the spell, speak the command word, point and the target, and think of the new weight. If no target is selected, you become the target.<br />

<br />
<br />
VIII. Shape Body<br />
This spell allows you to shape your own or another’s body. You can make them fatter, thinner, taller, shorter, stout, lanky. It can be used in combination with other spells to add visual effect if there is none, but it is mostly used for minor changes that the other spells are not needed for. The spell’s command word is ‘body’ and little energy is required to cast it. Simply point at the target, speak the command word, and picture how you want to shape the body. If no target is selected, you become the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
IX. Body Alteration<br />
This spell is to used to make a body look drastically different. You can change the color of one’s skin, change how much hair they have, their eyes, give them a horn or horns, tails (though it will always come out monkey like with this spell) , and many things that do and do not belong on a human body. However, it is important to note, that if you use this spell to give someone wings or something similar that they will not be able to fly or gain other supernatural abilities. This spell makes cosmetic changes, it doesn’t alter reality. Though, giving someone claws or a horn could probably still cut someone pretty badly. The spell requires a large amount of energy to cast. The command word is ‘alteration’ and you cast it by speaking the command word, pointing at your target, and picturing the changes you want. A warning, this spell can be used to turn someone into say a huge ball of flesh, and not be lethal. However, being turned into, say a huge ball of flesh, is likely to drive some people insane and make them wish they were dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
X. Body Swap<br />
This spell is quite simple. It allows the caster to either switch bodies with someone, or to make two others switch body. Because of the complication of the two targets being in different areas the spell is a bit different to cast. Instead of pointing at the target, the caster must have a piece of their body, hair, nail clippings, or something to represent them. If the caster only has them from one person, when casting the spell he or she will switch bodies with that person. If the caster has pieces of two individuals then he or she can make those individuals swap bodies. The spell requires a large amount of energy, and the command word is ‘swap’.<br />
<br />

The books stop glowing, and all fall to the ground. You quickly gather them up and turn to face the half-naked girl, who all this time, has just been stareing at you. She finally speaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who... or what, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She probaly hasn't seen to many half raccoon half human creatures in her lifetime.</p>
