<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having fun with the other children, Sam spent the rest of the afternoon playing. When dusk fell, he was invited over to another kid's house. Happy, not caring, he accepted the offer, figuring this would be only time he would ever get to relive his childhood.<br />
<br />
The kid turned out to be named Sam as well and at the kid's home, the kid greeted its mother and asked if Sam could join them for dinner and maybe spend the night.<br />
<br />
Suddenly caught in an awkward situation, Sam hastily explained that his mom was working late and it wouldn't be a problem. Satisfied, he watched as Sam's mother disappeared into the kitchen and then followed his new friend back to their room.<br />
<br />
Entering, Sam discovered something interesting. It turned out his new friend was actually a girl with some Tomboy tendencies. Not really caring, Sam just wanted to enjoy the time he had before he was forced to go back to finding a way to change back. Playing with Sam, the spent a couple hours first in the backyard and then watching t.v.<br />
<br />
When dinner was served, Sam found that he was enjoying himself and suddenly became worried because he didn't want to change back. He was happy and for once he had a true friend. Not the shallow people he met and sometimes hung around with at school, but someone he actually cared about...never mind is she was a girl. Confused and torn between to feelings, Sam suddenly wanted to go home.<br />
<br />
Instead, he swallowed some of the juice Ms. Matterson offered him and asked to be excused when dinner had been complete.<br />
<br />
Afterward, the evening flew by and before Sam knew it, he was lying on Sam's floor under a blanket, listening as the house fell silent. Above and to his right, Sam shifted in her sleep and in the floor, Sam wondered what she would do if he simply disappeared. Troubled by these thoughts, he drifted off to sleep.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Waking early to the sun beaming down on his face, Sam was momentarily confused. And then it hit him. He was nine years old and sleeping over at another kid's house. Pushing the blanket down, he pulled the medallion out from beneath his shirt and looked at it. Blinking he thought, &quot;I'll give it one more shot and if it don't work I guess I'll just grow up again. Maybe I'll be happier this time around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Throwing the blanket back, Sam sat up and wondered whether the other Sam wore boys underwear. Opening a dresser drawer, Sam found shorts and pants suitable for a young boy, but he didn't want that. Closing the drawer he tried the next and then next.<br />
<br />
To his disappointment, Sam wore all boys clothes except for the underwear, which were something suitable for a girl about Sam's age. Looking at the sleeping girl, Sam suddenly wondered how old she was. &quot;I would think she is about eight,&quot; Sam thought as he looked back at the open drawer, once again torn between two different feelings.<br />
<br />
On one hand he wanted to see if the medallion actually changed a person more then once, but on the other hand he didn't want to try it with a pair of girl's underwear. But at the same time he didn't want to run home to get something of his. Confused, he let his mind flip-flop back and forth, weighing the different options. After a bit, Sam shifted in her bed and worried that he might get caught, Sam made up his mind.<br />
<br />
Grabbing an unopened package of underwear, he quietly stole across the bedroom, out into the hallway and down toward the bathroom. Inside, he shut the door and reaching down, he pulled off the shorts he had been wearing yesterday.<br />
<br />
Opening the package of underwear, he breathed in the scent of new linen and then reached in extracted a pair. Unfolding them, he took in the pink color, the white hearts and the Hello Kitty designs. Setting the package of underwear on a nearby shelf, Sam then proceeded to shuck off his shirt.<br />
<br />
Naked, except for the amulet, he turned to a full body mirror hanging on the back of the door, breathed in and out a couple of times and then touched the underwear to the medallion.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened and Sam was torn between relief that he wasn't turning into a girl and disappointment that he couldn't change back. And then he realized his mistake and touched the panties to his skin while he touched them to the amulet.<br />
<br />
The effect was instantaneous. Before Sam's eyes his hair grew out and turned a light shade of golden brown. As this occurred, Sam's height dropped by five inches and he could feel his weight shift as the baby fat of his youth reasserted itself in certain areas. As this happened, his face shifted, eyes took on a hazel color and his skin began to become more smooth.<br />
<br />
But the biggest shock for same was when his prepubescent penis and testicles began to shrink even more then what they were. Before his eyes, they first began to shrink and then to move downward. As his genitals reached the area between his legs, the area down there opened up and his penis and testicles where swallowed. A ticklish feeling announced the arrival of his new reproductive organs and withing minutes the transformation was over and Sam found himself looking into the mirror at an eight year old girl.<br />
<br />
Excited that the amulet worked a second time, he was brought violently back to the here and now as he could hear someone walking down the hall toward the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Scared suddenly, fearing he was about to be caught, he threw back on the shirt...now a bit to big...picked up his shorts and rushed toward the toilet. Silently, he lifted up the seat and sitting down, he placed over his ankles the underwear he was wearing and the shorts he was holding.<br />
<br />
As he finished this, the door opened and Ms. Matterson entered. Seeing Sam sitting on the toilet, she said, &quot;Excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was up yet. Is Sam awake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking your head, Ms. Matterson was just about to leave when she said, &quot;If you need a change of clothes, I'm sure Sam will let you borrow something of hers. You look to be about her age and height, though only an inch shorter,&quot; and then exited the room.<br />
<br />
Sliding off the toilet as soon as Ms. Matterson had left, Sam pulled up the underwear and shorts, thought how weird it felt to have a piece of cotton pressing against the genitals when they were between the legs instead of in front, and the flushing she went to wash her hands and see if the other Sam was awake yet.</p>
