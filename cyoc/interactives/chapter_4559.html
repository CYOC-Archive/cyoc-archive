<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dinner time moved quickly and with little discussion. As Sarah and Lusious strolled together to her study Lynn was approached by one of the diner's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look dear Lynn, tonight you may have sealed the fate of Joyce. I for one am not pleased to see that carring person used as fodder in Lusious' plans. I will find a reason to get you transfered from the house to the barn if she is degraded, do you understand me?&quot; said the woman.<br />
<br />
Lynn was unable to turn around as her shoulders were held tight in the woman's grasp. Rather than fighting with a possible friend she simple gave a nod.<br />
<br />
Then Lynn without turning round walked slowly and thinking about the coming meeting with the two evil people. As she got to the door of the dinning room she said without turning round, &quot;Please meet with me in the morning on my deck for a private breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
The walk was short but her mind was running fast as she considered what was to be asked and answered. As she opened the door to the study she saw Sarah sitting to one side of a fireplace with a roaring fire. Lusious stood to her right and Joyce was sitting in a chair in the corner.<br />
<br />
As Lynn entered she looked about at the room. the walls were covered in old books and computer disc's. The floor was all light hardwood with a red rug in the middle of the floor. A design made of white and gold threads showed an angel dressed in gold and having a bright white circle for a face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in Lynn and have a seat, I have a thousand questions in my mind.&quot; said Lusious.<br />
<br />
As Lynn sat down she looked to one side at Joyce who by now had been sedated into a deep sleep. &quot;Sarah what are Lusious' thoughts for Joyce? She has served you well for a few years no doubt. I was a little rough on her reputation at dinner but she should be offered better than what he did to Mary Jo and now Ken.&quot; said Lynn with a side gaze at lusious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearest Lynn it would seem that our business is completely open to you. I find it had to believe that without any pompting an outsider would consider falling into outr little gold mine. I wonder what you answered the case worker that would offer such information while becoming impartial toward our situation?&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's a large issue to be answered in one statement. Let me see it was many items of info that crossed by path, but mostly were those two bovine security guards this morning as they escorted a handcuffed Ken down the backstairs. To see him so happy in going to his new job in Arizona and the discussion about him as if he were slightly less than human would suggest that Lusious was using him for his sex as he disgarded his body. I would lay a good bet that in Oh say six months we should see him shipped out as an Arabian stallion, right Lusious?&quot; asked Lynn with a big smile.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Lusious were dumbfounded to hear their plans so openly discussed by someone who only yesterday had arrived at the farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want to know what you told the Caseworker to get her off the trail of Mary Jo?&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
Lynn leaned back and with a sigh said, &quot;Oh that was rather simple really! I listened to her rambling on about a cab driver that had a run in with Sir DeVile' in Chicago sometime back. Seems her interest was compounded by Lusious use of and injection into the neck of the cabby. Since then the man has developed a lusty desire to mount nanny goats at Northwestern University. I simply told her that he had worked here to develope his strange trade, but when he used it on an employee named Mary Jo Cooper my boss fired him. The last we saw of him was when he drove away with one of our horse trailers attached to his vehicle. Oh and the trailer had his property in it being poor Mary Jo! Then she asked me why we didn't report the situation to the police? I laughed and asked her if she had told what was going on with the cabby man would any normal uninformed Policeman believe such a story?  Why she'd end up in a mental hospital at best!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynn stopped to see the reaction of the two and then added, &quot;The lady was very greatful for my understanding  and openly informing her of Mary Jo and the evil man there standing next to you. It was her thought to close the case and put out a A.P.B. on my discription of Lusious!&quot; said Lynn now really smiling at Lusious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great I'm hot and Mary Jo Cooper is not what did we gain here?&quot; asked Lusious showing some dark building rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really tell the lady about Lusious?&quot; asked Sarah as she stirred in the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why yes of course I did he was something odd you know, just like the mad man she wanted to hear about. I told her he was from France and stood about five foot three inches. He was very over weight and tipped the scales to about two hundred plus. He was balding and middleaged with a funny handlebar mustach. One trait of his was to scratch his groin when nervous about sex, and loved to watch horses mounting, there what do you think?&quot; asked Lynn.<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled as she looked at Lusious being all of six foot plus and slender as if half starved. &quot;Great that should settle that, Oh but what if anyone else should call or write, how will you handle them?&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, I made a recording of the conversation and printed a complete copy of what she asked and I answered. I even had that interesting description of Lusious if ever I'm asked again!&quot; replied Lynn now beaming with pride as being the worlds fastest liar.<br />
<br />
Sarah got up and pointed at Joyce still slumped in the corner chair. &quot;Lusious take her to Barn Lab seven and give me a new mare for next springs sessions.&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please may I ask for her Please?&quot; asked Lynn. &quot;I think it would set a poor president at the dinner table if so soon another long time worker ends up in the barn. I suggest we let her sleep it off till morning. Then before breakfast you Sarah tell her that Lusious was wanting her for Lab seven but I saved her form a beastial life. If she is at all human she should react very greatful and it should also cover up the descent about Ken. You do understand that everybody generally knows he will be set to Araizona as a horse!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lusious gave an agreeable nod and Sarah smiled, &quot; You think well my dear I see a bright future for you here!&quot; Then as she looked toward Joyce she frowned. &quot;I see less likelyhoed of Joyce remaining as a employee and still think she'd better serve my use as a mare!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Lusious walked out of the room Lynn touched his shoulder. &quot;Lusious I would really like to view what is happening to Ken about now! I mean the thought of such wild changes stirs my blood. If you can change a person from man to beast and back again it would really something to see.&quot; wondered Lynn.<br />
<br />
Lusious smiled and put his boney fingers on her arm, &quot;Please come now and I'll show you more changing people than you could imagine.&quot;</p>
