<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
As Chris undressed before stepping into the shower, his clothes felt oddly tight. He hadn&#39;t realized just how tight his pants were until he undid the button and felt relief. It was then he noticed how his shirt was hugging his college gut, which was looking larger than he remembered. He frowned as he prodded the soft, round form that was his stomach. He must have put on more weight than he realized. It might not hurt to try and work out a little more often, or at all.<br />
He also felt that his body hair looked a little thicker, the sparse coverage of dark hair on his chest looking darker and more mature. He had read somewhere once that it wasn&#39;t unusual for men to continue growing more body hair. their mid-twenties. So, he wasn&#39;t too worried.<br />
He stepped into the shower, adjusted the temperature so the water was somewhere between freezing and scalding, and proceeded to soap up. He couldn&#39;t help but notice that his body felt strange. It was strangely soft in some places, and felt unusually hard in others, like he developed muscles without realizing it. Looking down, his arms did look more jacked than he remembered them being. The hair on them seemed darker and thicker than before, as well. <br />
Chris stuck his head directly under the shower and blasted his face with the water. He must still be tired. This weird Chronivac thing was messing with him. He just needed time to wake up properly. Then he could go to work.<br />
He stopped. Work? Work where? He was a full time student. Still, Chris couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he shouldn&#39;t stay in the shower for too long, or he&#39;d be late and the chief would be mad.<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; Chris muttered as he rubbed his eyes vigorously. He must&#39;ve been more out of it than he thought. Then he caught a glimpse of his hands.<br />
His once-slender fingers now seemed thick and blunt, attached to a pair of equally thick and calloused palms. The thick, dark hair on the backs of his hands and down his meaty arms ran in dark rivulets, soaked from the shower.<br />
Chris slammed open the shower door and stumbled out into the bathroom, ungainly due to the distribution of his new weight. He immediately noticed the sizable yet solid gut hanging just below his impressive if somewhat soft pecs, all of which had a decent layer of dark, wet hair.<br />
Chris slapped his face with his meat hooks that could be called hands in an attempt to snap himself out of this weird hallucination he must be having. That&#39;s when he noticed something else now seemed to be off. He reached back into the shower and shut off the water before grabbing his towel and wiping away the thick fog that had covered the bathroom mirror. He stood in complete disbelief at what he saw.<br />
He was bigger, certainly. No, wider. He wasn&#39;t any taller, but he was certainly wider. There was the jutting gut, the big, round pecs, and the muscular arms and shoulders. There were also his thighs and calves, which also seemed to have become impressively thick with both fat and muscle. Everything was covered in dark hair, still wet from the shower. It carpeted his chest, covered his gut, arms, and legs, and even crawled up his shoulders. He couldn&#39;t see his back, but could guess it might be there as well. As he glanced up and down, he finally laid eyes on his face. His once-thin face was now round, with chubby cheeks and drooping second chin, giving him a friendly look. His new, thick beard stubble kept him from looking too young, though. As he took it all in, Chris noticed a few specks in his stubble. he leaned in close, noting the lines at the corners of his eyes and etched in his forehead, making his skin look rough and weathered. A few of the hairs in his stubble seemed to be white, in contrast to the surrounding dark. As he watched, he noticed the hairs on his chin were changing color, snapping from black to white in front of his eyes. As he leaned back, he saw his forehead looked larger than before. Was his hair receding? Still slicked down from the shower, his hairline seemed to be gradually hiking up. As he leaned back, he saw his brow looked more prominent than before, his eyebrows becoming thicker, his nose had reshaped too, becoming bigger in shape. Chris scowled at the reflection, deep frown lines appearing.<br />
Chris realized he was still holding the towel. He quickly rubbed it in his hair to dry it out. He&#39;d better hurry, the chief would chew his ass if he was late to work.<br />
Why did he keep thinking about work? He should be freaking out right now! Sure, he was freaking out a little bit, but not nearly as much as he should have. He didn&#39;t even know any chief.<br />
Then it struck him. The Chronivac. He&#39;d told it to apply the detective package to him. He&#39;d assumed it was some sort of simulation. But what if it was real?<br />
He heard a sharp beep from the other room, the Chronivac&#39;s timer finishing. And here he was, a detective, not wanting to be late for work.<br />
He pulled the towel away from his head, relieved to see he still had most his hair. He ran a comb through his damp hair, noting his was fairly receded, and thin at the back, but it was still there. There were also numerous specks of grey just in front of his ears, and the stubble on his chin seemed to be mostly white, with flecks of white on his round cheeks.<br />
He finished drying himself off, discovering that his body hair fluffed significantly afterwards and that he did indeed have substantial back hair. Naked and a bit damp, he made his way back to Anthony&#39;s computer and looked over his new stats. He smirked, despite himself. He&#39;d put on over a hundred pounds of fat and muscle.<br />
He again felt the urge to get himself to work, lest he be late. This was problematic as he didn&#39;t actually have a job and so he didn&#39;t know where he could possibly...<br />
Chris then saw a black notepad on the desk next to the computer, an address written and underlined. Chris furrowed his brow, which felt more natural every time he did it. <br />
“Detective office. Should check it out” he said aloud, before immediately pausing. His voice had changed. <br />
He sounded gruff, and incredibly gravelled. Chris also noticed he was talking to himself aloud. Shaking it off he picked up the notepad for a look. <br />
“I need to get going” <br />
Chris glanced out the window at the new dormitories, still under construction. Maybe he could slip over? He was still naked, and he was sure none of his clothes would fit him any more, but maybe...<br />
No! This was crazy! The device was between jobs right now, and he could easily just change himself back.<br />
Wait... If it worked on him, did that mean he&#39;d actually turned Anthony into a suburban dad? Chris had to see that in person. Perhaps he should change himself back and try to find him. It would be hilarious. Or, maybe it would be safer if Chris stayed a detective. If Anthony saw Chris had changed himself into a hefty, middle-aged man as well he might not be as mad.<br />
Either way, he needed clothes. <br />
He crossed the hall to his room and opened the wardrobe and pulled out a pair of jeans that should be just about long enough. He sat on the bed and pulled them over his legs, before standing up to pull them up.<br />
Chris then re opened the wardrobe, picked up an old t-shirt, and shut it. When he looked back in the mirror, he stared at his reflection confused. His ill fitting blue jeans were now a pair of brown tailored slacks. Chris turned to examine them, before shrugging.<br />
“Guess I don’t have to worry about my clothes not fitting...” <br />
He then pulled on the t-shirt, but as he finished pulling it over his head, he looked in the mirror to see he was wearing a worn white dress shirt, untucked, half unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up. Going with it, he tucked his shirt in and did the buttons up, leaving the last one undone. <br />
“Hmmph” Grunted Chris.<br />
Carrying on, Chris knelt down to put on his shoes, to find his socks where now black sheer dress socks, and his sneakers had become leather brown oxfords the second he looked away. He put them on, noticing how they resized to fit his larger feet. He finished tying the laces, before standing up.<br />
He examined the look before giving a half smile. <br />
“A little old school... not bad though”<br />
He took his leather jacket off the hook and pulled it on. However, the second he looked away, it became a worn trench coat. Chris raised a eyebrow. <br />
“Figured that’d show up at some point”<br />
Chris remembered he’d left his wallet and keys and by the computer. When he found them, he realised they had changed too. His phone was now an old flip phone, and his wallet was bigger. It contained a police badge and ID. <br />
Chris looked at the ID, that now read ‘Detective Christopher Greaves’, along with his photo, birthdate, Police id number etc. <br />
Chris stuffed the wallet and cell in his pants pockets, before picking up the notepad. <br />
“Probably need this” <br />
Chris then headed out the door.<br />
“Okay.... what now”</p>
