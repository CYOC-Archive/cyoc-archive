<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner at the Wesleys&#39; wasn&#39;t particularly formal. Considering everyone there was a canine, it limited the menu options a bit. Though no one objected to having roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy. Mrs. Truman also brought snickerdoodles, which caught everyone&#39;s attention a lot. Especially Simon, since he had enjoying being able to eat sweets after his diabetes was cured. He wished he could have chocolate, but that was still poisonous to canines.<br />
<br />
It was still a pleasant meal even if the dining room was a little more crowded than usual what with the Wesleys, Travis, and the Trumans all being there. Technically, Luke wasn&#39;t really a part of the Truman family yet, but Simon was pretty sure it was heading that way. Not that he begrudged his mom for dating him. Luke seemed a pretty upright guy for an uplifted wolf. The main reason it had taken this long to set up this dinner was because he was so dedicated to his job at the APD and had trouble getting some time off. The grey wolf was more often seen in a police uniform than in the polo shirt and khaki pants he was now wearing. But despite his slight workaholic tendencies, Simon liked Luke. He was just as interested in his mom as she was in him and he seemed to be a good match for her. Simon didn&#39;t begrudge him for trying to take the place of his late father and Luke was trying to make an effort to reach out to Simon like he was his own pup.<br />
<br />
Simon&#39;s mom went through a rather drastic change with her conversion. Not just because she was a tawny wolf with similar coloring to Simon&#39;s, but her personality seems to have shifted quite a bit. Now that she didn&#39;t have to worry about her son&#39;s health, she had a new man in her life, and she has been given a second youth, she&#39;s become quite energetic. This could easily be seen in her current appearance. She had her sandy blonde hair in a bouncy perm, which obviously drew some envy from uplifted canines. She was also wearing more casual clothes, namely a tank top that showed a good part of her enhanced cleavage and some tight pants. It made Simon a little uncomfortable with how sexy his mom was dressing, especially since they were now so close in physical age. But if it made her happy, Simon wasn&#39;t going to complain.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wesley was showing a little bit of roundness, but that didn&#39;t stop her from passing the potatoes. &quot;So, Sandra, how have you been adjusting?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, call me Sandy,&quot; said Mrs. Truman, &quot;&#39;Sandra&#39; makes me feel so old.&quot; Simon and Malice exchanged glances at that. &quot;But you know despite all the changes of species and animals becoming people, I&#39;m actually becoming ok with it,&quot; said Mrs. Truman, &quot;After all, it&#39;s given my boy a better chance in life and what more can a mother ask for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don&#39;t mind Mary Alice being with him?&quot; asked Mr. Wesley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course not,&quot; said Mrs. Truman, &quot;She just has the most wonderful sense of humor and she&#39;s very sweet as well. Besides, I&#39;d be a hypocrite to say no to her and Simon considering what me and Luke get up to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke cleared his throat and asked, &quot;Can we please not discuss this at the dinner table?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Mrs. Truman, &quot;Everyone&#39;s going to be doing it after dinner anyways.&quot; This resulted in quite a few spit takes from some of the others, particular Mr. and Mrs. Wesley. Sarah and Malice were trying very hard not to burst out laughing and even Travis was trying to hold back a grin. If Simon&#39;s face wasn&#39;t covered in fur, it would be bright pink right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...you said you weren&#39;t going to embarrass me,&quot; said Simon through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there&#39;s no need to feel any shame,&quot; said his mom, &quot;We&#39;re all adults here, more or less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you&#39;re not suggesting that we all go into the living room afterwards and just mate with our respective partners,&quot; said Mrs. Wesley flatly. Both Sarah and Simon winced at that. While they were looking forward to mating, they&#39;d rather not have the image of their respective parents in their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I&#39;m not THAT loose,&quot; said Mrs. Truman, &quot;I can bring Mary Alice and Simon back to my place and you&#39;ll have the house to yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t that be a relief,&quot; said Mr. Wesley dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;She really isn&#39;t that irresponsible,&quot; said Luke, &quot;She&#39;s just allowing herself to loosen up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, just...don&#39;t bring it up at the dinner table,&quot; said Mrs. Wesley.<br />
<br />
Simon gave a sigh of relief at that. His mother has been acting a little too much like the wild college girl she had been. Hopefully Luke will help mellow her out a bit eventually. He just hoped this evening wouldn&#39;t go without too many problems.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Once supper was over, the Trumans went back to their house with Malice. Malice couldn&#39;t help be a little bouncy with excitement. She had been waiting so long to have a mate of her own and now she was finally going to go all the way with Simon. Of course, she&#39;ll be on the pill so she won&#39;t have pups yet, but that was fine. Just being with Simon would be more than enough.<br />
<br />
Simon and Malice didn&#39;t waste any time dashing upstairs to Simon&#39;s room. Simon was a little shocked this was going so fast. He had never brought a girl up to his room for any reason and now he was going to have sex with her. He never imagined himself in a situation like this before the Animalia Outbreak. But then, he was a skinny guy who had to deal with diabetes, hardly worth any girl&#39;s attention. But after becoming a wolf, he had several girls competing for his attention and the winner was definitely one to be proud of.<br />
<br />
Malice put a lot of effort into just ripping the clothes off of herself and Simon. Simon did like her forward personality, but she didn&#39;t want to scare him off right when they were about to get busy. So Malice took her time with removing her clothes, giving him a sensual little striptease. Malice didn&#39;t really have any shame about being naked. Being born a dog, she never really saw the need to cover herself up and as an Animalian, she mainly complied with being closed so that others would be comfortable around her. Once she was fully in the buff, she posed sexily for Simon. &quot;So, what do you think?&quot; she asked coyly.<br />
<br />
Simon couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of Malice&#39;s body. She had been giving him plenty of chances to check her out but now she was standing there in all her curvy, muscular glory. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what I deserved to get someone like you,&quot; he said honestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were kind, concerned for your mother, wanted to honor your uncle, and you have a great sense of duty,&quot; said Malice, walking up to him, &quot;That&#39;s what I really love about you.&quot; With that, she leaned in and gave him a kiss. Simon was quick to respond. Of course, he and Malice had given each other licks and kisses before, but this was more passionate than usual. Then Simon felt Malice&#39;s fingers hook onto the front of his pants. Well, he was aching to let his rod out so he reached down and undid his pants and pulled down both his pants and underpants to reveal the wolf cock he owned. Malice looked down at it with raised eyebrows. &quot;Wow,&quot; she said, &quot;You&#39;re bigger than I imagined.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon felt rather proud at that. He knew his cock got bigger after his conversion, but he wasn&#39;t sure if it was at a size that would be impressive, considering it wasn&#39;t an easy thing to compare with others. &quot;Well, a big guy like this requires a lot of attention,&quot; he said boastfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it will get it,&quot; said Malice. She gave Simon a few strokes, making Simon moan a little. But then she backed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Aren&#39;t we gonna get started?&quot; asked Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and I can&#39;t waste any more time with foreplay,&quot; said Malice before leaning over the bed, pointing her round ass towards Simon, &quot;I need you in me right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon raised an eyebrow at that. He knew Malice was forward, but he didn&#39;t think she&#39;d be that impatient to get down to business. But then, who was he to complain? He quickly took off the rest of his clothes, allowing her to see his enhanced, muscular form. With that, he walked up to Malice and grasped her tail with his left hand and used his right hand to guide his cock. Once his head was pushing against her lips, he let go and placed his hands on her cheeks. With slow determination, he started pushing inside.<br />
<br />
Malice moaned as she felt herself starting to be penetrated. But it was going too slow for her. She looked back and said, &quot;Stop being gentle and start mating!&quot; With a shrug, Simon pushed himself all the way in. Malice gave a moan of satisfaction as she felt him filling her. As soon as Simon was fully in, he backed out a bit before thrusting again. Malice let out a yip of excitement as Simon started to speed up. This was how canines should be doing it: the male humping the female from behind. Of course, the humans probably had other sexual positions that were just as enjoyable, but this was how she wanted to lose her virginity. She growled with increasing arousal as Simon smacked against her, making her breasts bounce. &quot;Yes, make me howl, make me howl like a bitch,&quot; she growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where my mom can hear it?&quot; said Simon through gritted teeth, too caught up in the pleasure to stop even if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll be howling any minute now. Now make howl. Make me hoooooooowwwwlll!!!&quot; The last part became a real howl as Malice hit the peak of her pleasure and began orgasming. Simon couldn&#39;t resist his instincts any longer. He let out a howl himself as he drove his cock in deep and let out a huge load into Malice. The two canines collapsed on Simon&#39;s bed, panting loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...was awesome...&quot; Simon managed to say at last. He could still feel himself embedded in Malice, his swollen knot keeping them from separating any time soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just what I hoped it would be,&quot; said Malice happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...what do we do while I&#39;m still stuck?&quot; asked Simon, pulling back slightly for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can just cuddle until you&#39;re ready to go again,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can agree to that,&quot; said Simon before leaning in and kissing Malice.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Of course, Sandy and Luke heard Simon and Malice&#39;s howling. They had just went through a round of sex themselves. They didn&#39;t howl with their climax so that her son and his new mate wouldn&#39;t feel rush. &quot;That&#39;s my boy,&quot; said Sandy proudly, &quot;He&#39;s growing up so fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too fast, I hope,&quot; said Luke. He was quite comfortable with lying on Sandy&#39;s bed with Sandy herself lying on top of him, her pussy wrapped tightly around his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to be worried he wouldn&#39;t be able to make it in the real world,&quot; said Sandy, &quot;What with his diabetes taking up most of whatever income he would have, I wasn&#39;t sure he&#39;d have a good life. But now he has good health, a respectable job to look forward to, and a mate who shares his passion. That&#39;s good enough for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t mind him leaving the den now?&quot; asked Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be for a while yet,&quot; said Sandy, &quot;And if you&#39;re worried about me getting Empty Nest Syndrome, there could always be more pups later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke raised an eyebrow, &quot;Right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not until Luke&#39;s ready to leave the house. We have time before we need to be serious about it,&quot; said Sandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we have time for more loving,&quot; said Luke as he felt his energy start to increase.<br />
<br />
Sandy grinned before sitting back. &quot;Of course we do,&quot; she said as she started riding Luke again. There will be time for deeper relationship things later, like proposals, wedding plans, making one of the rooms into a nursery. But that was for later seasons. Sandy was young and vivacious again and she wanted to enjoy it more.</p>
