<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being the goddess of hearth and home, she took personal responsibility for all her guests&#39; satisfaction and she had an unhappy customer. Hospitality falls directly into her realm and since there was a malfunction, on her watch no less, it was a matter of pride that she truly fix this mishap. Despite her intention of walking away with youth to sell, she was now 100% committed to making this right for him.<br />
<br />
She was frantic, she simply couldn&#39;t collect all his youth to return to him. Even if she did, his body still wouldn&#39;t age normally, and using another&#39;s youth wouldn&#39;t last, like her own treatment.<br />
<br />
If she could get past his rejection, she could supplement his youth with some other person&#39;s like the boy from earlier today. If it would last longer than a month, she could send him home with a little extra to combat the inevitable youth that doesn&#39;t &quot;take root&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hebe pondered for a moment what she was trying to fight against... if he were to reclaim his youth immediately, he would still look 18 due to some of the youth being lost in the process, but by next year he would be almost 30 due to his body not being able to reabsorb all his youth back efficiently... if she gave him a drop a day... Hebe glanced at Derrick who had not stopped glaring at her. No that&#39;s not an option.<br />
<br />
With a flash of sudden insight the answer came to her, she can use his body to filter out the impurities that his body wouldn&#39;t accept and then he wouldn&#39;t reject the extra youth from other sources... the idea was so crazy it just might work.<br />
<br />
She raced to the sauna Derrick had just come from and collected the vial of his extracted youth, carefully placing it into the lockup with her existing reserves, She collected the 45 years she collected from the boy before him and supplemented it with most of her supply to make the 60 years Derrick had lost.<br />
<br />
She immediately took it to Derrick and had him drink it. Within a minute the effects began taking hold, His wrinkles quickly began to subside and he seemed to visibly feel better. Reaching 55 his hair began to take back some of its color and began progressing, err. un-receding? <br />
<br />
Derrick was excited to watch youth return to him. &quot;Do you have a mirror, I want to see!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; Hebe said directing him to a non malfunctioning sauna. &quot;See for yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick walked in and Hebe quickly set up the extraction of the 60 years she just provided. Derrick was completely absorbed in his transformation, reaching his late 20&#39;s the hair he had lost was a thick head of stubble. Derrick laughed, he was going to need a haircut so he wouldn&#39;t look weird. It was better than the alternative.<br />
<br />
&quot;As it stands, this will keep you your original age for a few days or so and then each day after that you will be about two years older until you are back to an old man.&quot;, Hebe interrupted.<br />
<br />
Derrick looked at her horrified, &quot;You said you&#39;d fix me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Hebe frowned beginning to feel unappreciated, &quot;No, you told me to fix you, and I told you that the process is permanent! I agreed to figure out what can be done and that might require some acceptance on your part! You signed a waiver and you left the age adjustment up to me! You&#39;re lucky there was a malfunction or you would be just plain out of luck and stuck like this for the rest of your life!&quot; <br />
<br />
Derrick&#39;s body, now a strapping 20 year old following in his family&#39;s robust footsteps, he was ramping up on the hormones and down on the prefrontal cortex development. In an insulted rage he began to lumber forward to attack as Hebe slammed the door shut and locked it. Derrick yelled all the obscenities and pounded on the door. Hebe just watched him and was visibly upset by how unhappy he was.<br />
<br />
A few moments later the youth was fully integrated into Derricks body and mind and he was back to his old young self. The whole experience seemed surreal and he almost hoped that the special part of the water was that it caused weird dreams and this was all in his mind. He came back to the door and knocked on the door. Hebe stared back at him still upset by how he had acted. Derrick apologized for upsetting her, explained how scary this is for him and asked to be let out. <br />
<br />
Hebe shook her head no and turned on the machine walking away as the process will take around 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Derrick immediately panicked not realizing that this was Hebe trying to help.<br />
<br />
Hebe went back to her desk for the duration, the double filtered youth that she will extract from him will have had 2 different bodies trying to hold onto it and should be purer and therefore more potent than the normal youth she extracts, hopefully? Maybe? This whole situation is unsettling, he should have come out 45 not 75. She could still hear him screaming and sobbing in terror, not realizing that she isn&#39;t trying to kill him but help him attain the impossible. Permanent youth.<br />
<br />
She returns to see a broken old man weeping, she opens the extraction receptacle to find...</p>
