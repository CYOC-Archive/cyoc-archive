_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll play along. How about you, Caleb?&quot; Morgan asked his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; He looked forlorn in Andrew&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet. This won&#39;t be so bad. I mean, even if you don&#39;t like our bodies, it&#39;s still an incredible experience to literally be someone else. And it won&#39;t be forever.&quot; Seth enthused. Caleb look unimpressed, but Morgan had to admit the novelty of it was still awing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... do you even want to go in there?&quot; Caleb suddenly asked, stopping Morgan from reaching for the door to knock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was, but what do you have in mind?&quot; Morgan inquired, a bit surprised. Seth and Andrew eyed Caleb with some confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just... I don&#39;t think I can deal with all of this right now. Can we just go somewhere else? I need to process this.&quot; Caleb explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you two ok with that?&quot; Morgan asked Seth and Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll let the others know y&#39;all took off. What do you want us to say again?&quot; Andrew asked, with Seth nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell them it&#39;s me in Seth&#39;s body, and Caleb in Andrew&#39;s.&quot; Morgan said, looking to Caleb for approval. Caleb nodded, but his face seemed to drain of more color as Morgan verbally acknowledged the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, sounds good. Take care. No allergies of mine, but if you could, please make sure to put the medicine next to my bed on my- er, your face.&quot; Seth told Morgan.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Caleb, avoid shellfish in my body. We don&#39;t mix...&quot; Andrew warned. Caleb only nodded solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we get into each others rooms? I just thought about that...&quot; Morgan asked before they split up. Seth pulled out Morgan&#39;s phone, and the 4 of them went to the work of exchanging enough information that they could get into their rooms, phones, and so on. On that note, Morgan and Caleb wandered off. Seth&#39;s room was a floor below and on the far side of the building.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before they got there, and when they entered, Morgan checked to see if anyone was inside. The coast was clear, so the two began to commiserate about their situation.<br />
<br />
Caleb found a full length mirror on the back of the door, partially hidden by some towels. He pulled them down and the two took turns standing in front of the mirror. Caleb stroked his new goatee, and patted down his body again. He was about as thin as his original body, but he was still curious about the shape of his new form. He pulled up his t-shirt, and actually noticed a dark treasure trail leading down, but he wasn&#39;t sure about exploring south yet.<br />
<br />
When Morgan stepped up, he was struck by his new face more than anything. In his body, he had a thick beard that grew in quick. This body was smooth. Even pulled up his t-shirt confirmed that Seth was practically hairless. The other surprise about his stomach was actually the thing that struck him earlier when he first awoke in Seth&#39;s body. Seth was probably underweight, with a stomach that was tight, and really only bulged from organs, and not deposited fat. Similarly, as he traced his new hands (quite small, almost effeminate) along his body, he noticed that all the spots that normally rolled or jiggled with his porkiness was now quite taut. He couldn&#39;t wrap his hands around his arms, but his old hands for sure could.<br />
<br />
It was peculiar for Morgan, that as he explored and examined, he did realize his new penis was beginning to react. Morgan realized that, inherently, there was something sexually exciting about being someone else. Although he was rather vanilla, and still new to sex in general, he imagined this must be the ultimate form of role play. In an even kinkier sense too, because unless he was honest with a sex partner, he&#39;d be lying about his identity.<br />
<br />
Which brought him to a curious thought. He was openly gay in his own body. Well, open in the sense that he didn&#39;t hide it, but wasn&#39;t also explicitly shouting it from the roof tops. Did Seth know that Morgan was gay? Did he switch knowing he would become a gay man? Was Seth gay? And most perplexing... did sexuality follow someone through the Mindweft? Or was it rooted in the body?<br />
<br />
As he turned to Caleb in Andrew&#39;s body, he realized his boner was snaking down his tight joggers. Caleb blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude... either we keep our sexuality, or Seth is gay.&quot; Morgan stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never knew what Andrew identified as, but I think I&#39;m still straight.&quot; Caleb stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Morgan said. He was actually starting to get used to the feeling of Seth&#39;s body. Not as in with his hands, but rather moving around without his old weight, and being a bit shorter too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. What would these guys even do?&quot; Caleb asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, weird shit like the Mindweft I guess.&quot; Morgan offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;True. God, I know I was kind of a nerd in my own body, but I fucking hate this ugly ass goatee... Looks like that guy from Iron Giant but shorter and blonder.&quot; Caleb said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got an idea!&quot; Morgan said, suddenly feeling a way to get revenge without technically violating their agreement with Seth and Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Caleb asked, surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s give these bodies a makeover!&quot; Morgan cackled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh FUCK yeah!&quot; Caleb yelped. &quot;This has got to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb pointed at the goatee, before pulling at some strands of hair as if to yank it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, shall we start with you or me?&quot; Morgan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, me, me, pleeeeaaase!&quot; Caleb cried. &quot;This prick is about to be clean-shaven. Plus I want to see what he&#39;s got to wear.&quot; Caleb said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, let&#39;s head over to his dorm, then we&#39;ll come back here?&quot; Morgan suggested. Caleb nodded, and was moving towards the door before Morgan even finished his sentence.</p>
