<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as the three heroes walked in the main building, Ty closed his eyes and started to concentrate on his lost buddy.<br />
<br />
“This is not good…” he said. “I can’t see where he is. He is either unconscious or he’s very far away from here.”<br />
<br />
“Where was the last place he came to, when he was still in school this afternoon?” Jason asked him.<br />
<br />
“He likes to hang out in the chemistry lab and in the computer room!” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
“Let’s check the computer room first!” Jason ordered. <br />
<br />
Jason, Ty and Peter then ran towards the computer room. When they opened the door, they found only Allen, Scott and Milton there. Milton was the biggest computer geek at school.<br />
<br />
“Kent? No, we didn’t see him in here today!” Milton told the three ChaosRiders.<br />
<br />
Jason, Ty and Peter immediately turned around, and they ran towards the chemistry lab. As soon as they walked in, they found Kent’s baseball cap on the floor. Peter walked around the lab and stopped at one of desks, where Kent’s backpack was resting on the chair.<br />
<br />
“Guys, I think Kent has been taken away, against his will. He would never leave his backpack and his books behind like this!” Ty told the other two.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but who? And why would someone want to kidnap Kent?” Jason wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Let me try to see if I can communicate with Kent using my psychic powers…” Ty said to them, as he closed his eyes and started to concentrate.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Kent was sitting on the floor, bound in the corner with his back against the wall. Randy, Tyrone and Paul had just checked up on him, but he was still unconscious. Just a few minutes after they left him, Kent began to wake up.<br />
<br />
Kent looked around the room, and he noticed that he was in some sort of room with no windows and only one door. There was a wooden table in the middle of the room, and there were some materials sitting on the table. Kent wanted to scream, but he couldn’t say anything, because he was gagged and tied up.<br />
<br />
Kent was scared and he felt a deep sense of panic coming over him. He wanted to get out, but he couldn’t move. He was thirsty, he was hungry, and he felt terrified. Where was he?<br />
<br />
Suddenly he heard a welcome voice ringing inside of his ears.<br />
<br />
“Kent… hey, Kent… Where are you?” he heard Ty say to him.<br />
<br />
“Hhhmmmmm!!” he mumbled. He couldn’t talk, for he was gagged. And Ty quickly realized what was going on.<br />
<br />
“Kent, you need to find out where you are! Just cooperate with your captors, okay?” Ty said to him.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… Hmmmm!!!” Kent tried to reply.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kent felt like something was changing. Ty could still change Kent anyway he wanted to, and Kent felt like the towel that was gagging him was becoming ever more loose. He realized that his head was shrinking! Within seconds, the towel was so loose, that it slowly dropped down and was now hanging from his neck.<br />
<br />
“Ty! Come and get me out of here, Ty! I’m scared!” Kent whispered. <br />
<br />
“Just sit tight, Kent. I’ll allow you to get loose from those ropes. In the meantime, find out where you are!” Ty responded.<br />
<br />
Kent began to wonder what Ty was going to do next. His head had grown back to its normal size, when he suddenly felt his arms and chest expanding! Ty was making Kent’s muscles grow, which seemed rather painful at first. The ropes were feeling ever tighter, as his pectorals, his arms, and his shoulders continued to grow thicker. Eventually, the thick rope began to tear, and the rope suddenly snapped and coiled down his chest, falling on his waist.<br />
<br />
As soon as Kent got up, he turned around. He heard someone unlocking the steel door from the other side. When the door opened, he was shocked to see Paul, Tyrone and Randy, who were staring him in the face.<br />
<br />
“Well, well…” Paul sneered at Kent. “Our little birdie managed to break out of his cage…”<br />
<br />
“What do you want? Where am I? What am I doing here?” Kent demanded from him.<br />
<br />
“You’re at my house” Paul explained. “See those supplies on the table? You got two sticks of dynamite, a battery and some electrical wiring, and several other things. I want you to build a bomb which will go off as soon as you press the ‘Power’ button on this remote! You had better make it work… Or else! You got an hour to put the bomb together for us!”<br />
<br />
Paul and the others then turned around and slammed the steel door shut. Kent immediately turned around and walked up to the wooden table.<br />
<br />
“Kent! You’re going to build their bomb…” Ty said to him. “But I’ll help you make some modifications to it! Just tell me what to change, and I’ll channel my power through you so that you can change the materials in front of you, so that the bomb is harmless! We’re coming to get you!”<br />
<br />
Peter grabbed a phone book, and looked up Paul’s address. He knew Paul from class, and he figured he knew how to find out where he lived. When he got the address, he wrote it down on a sheet of paper, and handed it to Jason.<br />
<br />
“Alright, gang!” Jason cheered. “Let’s go free our buddy from these goons!”<br />
<br />
The three of them ran out of the building and jumped back on their bikes. They immediately started their engines, and the three ChaosRiders quickly rode out of the school’s parking lot!<br />
<br />
“On to Paul’s house, guys!” Jason shouted. Ty and Peter rode right behind him, hoping to rescue their buddy soon enough.</p>
