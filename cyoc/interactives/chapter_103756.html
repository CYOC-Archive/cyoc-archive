<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are here at the high school reunion and it’s the first time you’ve been here in over 4 years. You just got off work at your local tech support and are still in your work clothes, badge and everything. You always were the nerdy tech kid. If there wasn’t something you didn’t know about technology then no one did. You can put together code and make floppy drives play music in your sleep. You always were such a computer geek and were bullied heavily in school.<br />
<br />
Video games were always your thing because you wished the virtual world was real. Mainly, you and your best friend Jeff were both such chocoholics. Jeff was always akin to chocolate and would sometimes fascinate about being chocolate in real life, but you take it a step further. You wish to be made of chocolate every single day your alive. You constantly think about what your life as chocolate would be like if it was real and what kind of powers you’d have. You also are known among most of the people here that you are a chocoholic from your chocolate avatars and characters you post and play online as.<br />
As you stroll into the high school reunion your thoughts on your chocolate fantasy vanish when you see your long term high school harasser as big as a house and making a scene at the reunion. Ugh, who brought that fuck here?” you say in a disgusted voice, trying to keep it to yourself. Brock overhears what you said waddles over to you, still swollen from eating Jeff. “What you say nerd!?” He yells at you. <br />
<br />
Brock is the last person on earth you’d want to be seeing right now. “I said fuck off fatzo. God you gained wait since I last saw your ugly fucking face.” Brocks face turns red as he screams at you “You not only called me fat but UGLY too? I ought to give you a black eye for that you fucking nerd! You didn’t even bother to take off your work clothes!” You stand up to Brock and say “Yeah I called you fat, what you going to do about it you dick?” Brock is fuming mad now and can’t hold his temper down at all as he yells at you again “My dad invented the chronivac and I know you love chocolate more than life. So when I get home, I’ll turn you into my chocolate bitch for the rest of your since your so gay for chocolate you fuckin’ nerd!”<br />
<br />
You laugh at him and say “And you think I won’t like that? Turning me into chocolate would only be giving me what I want. Run home and go cry to daddy… Fatass” You say as he storms off and gets into his car and starts to drive off. You then suddenly grasp the full situation you’re in as you know what a chronivac can do and realize that Brock isn’t going to let you enjoy your fantasy you’ve wanted your whole life since you were 12. But you do know how a chronivac works, and its security vulnerabilities…<br />
<br />
You quickly pull up your phone and open up a remote desktop program and sign into Brocks computer. You’ve been sending him viruses and trolling him for years, and he’s too dumb to ever change his passwords so getting in was as easy as a push of button. Its only seconds before you’ve gotten into this chronivac programs and load up the command console. You smerk with a grin and say “We’ll see how much of a bitch I am when I’m calling the shots, Brock.”<br />
<br />
You see on the chonivac’s menu that Brock already has presets made to make people think they wanted to be chocolate and turn them into his edible bitch boys, and that his last victim was your best friend Jeff. “He did this to Jeff? This program looks like it was run 3 days ago” you say with a bit of concern, you dig into his security camera footage and turn on the webcam to reveal the severed chocolate head of Jeff in a freezer. You nearly drop your phone in disgust at what he did your best pal and become enraged. You’ll make him pay for this dearly. <br />
<br />
You make a profile for yourself and set it up for a chocolate transformation to be designed similar to how Jeff got transformed but make it so that you will grow wings, long hair, elf ears, appear to be the age of 17 and have the body of a male elf, you want to look like your OC you play as online in your favorite MMO. Your profile then creates itself and displays the config menus. “Time to get to work” You say with a grin.<br />
<br />
You then enter that you have the power to turn anything you want into chocolate or candy when you will it and you can merge with or make yourself out of any form of candy or chocolate at will. You set it so that your body will have the properties of whatever you make yourself out of and that you can reshape yourself into anything you want whenever. You then enter into it that any candy you’re touching or standing on acts like part of your body so you can control it and continue to spread from it. You also set it so that you can turn candy into any other type of candy at will and can morph and reshape yourself very quickly. You also set it so that any candy or chocolate you are holding you can manipulate it as if it was your own flesh and will both feel it and be able to control it no matter how big.<br />
<br />
You then go to the setting for size changing and make it so that you can break parts off then reform to grow smaller or merge with chocolate to grow in size. You see that anything bitten off doesn’t grow back but you don’t care about it and instead make it so that you can just grow it back by absorbing more chocolate into you and reshaping the missing parts. You then change the settings for melting so that you can move while molten like a slime and climb up walls and ceilings and can melt into any other candy that’s bigger than you and morph your shape so that you can fit through any hole or crack to squeeze through if you’re molten or elastic.<br />
<br />
The machine then tells you to enter the types of candy you can make yourself out of. You enter chocolate as the default and then start entering other types of candy you can think of, chewing gum, honey, ice cream, licorice, marshmallow, peanut butter, caramel, Candy cane, lollipops, hard candy, soft candy, gummies, crackers, cookies, cakes, pastries, mint, various types of fruit-flavored fillings and snacks, syrup and the list goes on. <br />
<br />
You make it so that your form has the properties of every material your made of and then set it so that your body won’t have an expiration date. You want this to be permanent.<br />
<br />
You then start to enter other properties about the new you. You tell the machine that if you want to, you can break pieces of yourself off that will form into mini you’s that act as a single entity with you if you get chopped up or want to be in pieces, otherwise you stay in the largest piece. <br />
<br />
You set it so that your eyesight still works even when you have no eyes or aren’t even human shaped, you do the same for your sense of hearing, smelling, and taste. You set it so that you can only feel pleasure and make it so that being stretched, warped, twisted, morphed, reshaped, melting and reforming is downright orgasmic and that the pleasure you would sense in your genitals if you were aroused is the feeling your whole body will feel when these things happen.<br />
<br />
 You then set it so you won’t have any genitals by default and set them to go away near end of the transformation, and make it so that you can still shape them into you if you want them and they will function like normal. You set it so that if someone ingests your chocolate seed, they will get infected and turn into your chocolate slave within 10 minutes. You then enter into the program that you can turn people into both chocolate statues, and your chocolate slaves or children at will. You then make it so that your torso, legs, butt, arms, hands and feet will look smooth and effeminate like an elf’s body; you want to be a twink. <br />
<br />
Then set your body to have hair down to your waist and have it look like it is still individual strands but a solid mass attached to the back of your head. You then set your overall feel for your body to appear molded and smooth, you decide to keep your toes and fingers and your nails, your face, your eyes, your nose, your ears, your hair and your wings but your finer details will be smoothed out. A smooth- but sexy ken-doll body is what you want.<br />
<br />
 You also set it so that you are able to speak and set your voice to sound like something more like what a little chocolate boy would sound like. Including yourself and that you are always living candy and make it so that you do not have any internal organs at all, so that you will be solid milk chocolate but still able to bend and move both like a person and like rubber when you move.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you set the machine so that if you are eaten entirely or are destroyed, you will reform in the nearest large quantity of chocolate. And that Brock cannot undo or try to block your changes or transformation at all in any way. <br />
<br />
The machine takes a moment to register all of the changes you entered. It then asks how long you want to take to transform and its stage progression. You set it to take 10 minutes to complete from the moment you push start and feel like the best sex you had in your life and that the turning of your flesh into chocolate makes the area turned feels like your junk does right before orgasm. You also set the flesh to chocolate portion of your transformation to happen exactly like Jeffs with your chocolate erupting from your penis and spraying over you, turning you from the outside, inwards. You also set it to crawl into every whole you have and turn your insides that way as well as spread over your skin and turn you that way. And then the machine asks you to set how long the transformation to last. You set it to “INDEFINITE” and add the note that you are immortal.<br />
<br />
The machine throws a warning up saying that setting the duration to infinite means that any of the changes cannot be undone unless further changes are applied by you and you may not be in the condition needed to change them. You click “OK”.<br />
<br />
The machine then asks you for any further things you want to change about your life. You set the machine to start changing Brocks life. You don’t have that much time left before he gets to his house if he isn’t there already. You then enter that you will go to his house and he will be waiting for you. He will push the start button thinking he’s made you his bitch but in-fact it did nothing as you’ve already set the changes in motion. You will then change into your chocolate fantasy and brock will panic as you change into a winged elf, trying to enter changes to undo what you’ve done, but will only change himself into only be what you want him be even though he thinks he’s getting back at you and his panic will set in as the changes start to happen. Then you enter that he will have no memory of any of this if he sees all of this just as he gets to his room.<br />
<br />
You can see from the webcam that he is in shock… He drops is keys and bags and scrambles over to the computer, tripping over the rug, shoving his face in the webcam and seeing yours on your phone. He reaches for the mouse just smile at him and say with an evil grin “Who’s the bitch now Brock?” right as you press the “START” button.</p>
