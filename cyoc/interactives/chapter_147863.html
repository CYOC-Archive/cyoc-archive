<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beth turned over took the cards glancing at her husband, her now burly son Tyler, and Joey who was stroking the large tent in his pants. She loved the men in her life.  <br />
<br />
When she flipped the card to select the next topic, she saw the words, &quot;Bonus Round&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth turned the next card and read it. &quot;It says that Dad, Arnold, you are at the bottom of the points with only one right.&quot; She continued, &quot;For the next 20 minutes, you will have a chance to earn your way to the top by receiving from all the guys in the room.  If you don&#39;t you will remain on the bottom indefinitely. Also, guys, you&#39;ll be rewarded for your participation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth placed the card.  Waiting for this halftime game to commence. <br />
<br />
Arnold on the other hand hand a strange moment of clarity.  He didn&#39;t normally feed of the fluids of others, he normally wore pants, Joey surely didn&#39;t have that thing between his legs normally and it didn&#39;t make sense for Tyler to look so big and burly. His wife wasn&#39;t normally this under dressed.   Everything was wrong.  He had drank his son&#39;s piss.    That guy they had picked up on campus was doing this to them and he had to stop it.  But if he didn&#39;t do as he was told, what else would happen....<br />
<br />
<br />
Tears welled up in Arnold&#39;s eyes.  The clock was ticking.  He knew if he didn&#39;t do anything, his life was going to be changed again in some horrible and grotesque way.  <br />
<br />
He had to make a choice.  Take the punishment or survive the round.  After a moment&#39;s hesitation he looked to his wife and said, &quot;Sorry honey.&quot; For her part, Beth looked pleased and aroused as if nothing was wrong. <br />
<br />
Arnold looked over at Joey and said, &quot;Son, let me get you off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arnold got up and knelt by Joey.  With tears in his eyes he fished out the massive cock from its confinement.  <br />
<br />
Joey bucked his hips a little at his father&#39;s tentative grasp at his massive pole.  <br />
<br />
Arnold picked up his pace thinking to himself that at least a few minutes had passed since his deliberation and when Beth had stopped reading the card.  At this thought, he glanced at Beth and noticed that she was feeling herself up at the raunchy display between her husband and her eldest son.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, I need you to come for me.&quot; Arnold said in a gruff and desperate voice. Joey nodded in agreement but after what felt like another five minutes of  jerking, nothing seemed to be happening.  <br />
<br />
Arnold began to get worried.  If he wasted his time on Joey, he&#39;d never get to Tyler.  <br />
<br />
He thought about the game so far and how he had drank his son&#39;s piss less than thirty minutes before.   He decided that he was going to have to find a way to appease the teenage God they were all serving now.  He leaned his head forward and put his lips around the head of Joey&#39;s dick.  The mushroom tip was massive and it was was a strain for him to do more with it.  <br />
<br />
Arnold thought about things that Beth had done when she was younger and began to work the cock in his mouth still jerking and teasing it with his hands.   Time was running out. He looked with pleading eyes at Tyler.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Want some help Dad?&quot; Tyler said.  Arnold didn&#39;t nod but he didn&#39;t change his pace.  He was surprised when Tyler came up behind him and ripped the back out of his white briefs. Then, he felt pain as if a hot poker had been thrust in his flesh as the large leaking cock of his older son pushed into his ass.  <br />
<br />
Arnold stifled a scream as Tyler rammed in hard and fast and then pulled back out and then in again working at a breakneck pace.  Arnold tensed but he didn&#39;t stop his work on Joey.  He had to finish this and hold on to himself.  He knew the price for failure would be more than he could bear.  <br />
<br />
After what felt like eons, Joey tensed up and shot a series of spurts deep down his dad&#39;s throat.  He didn&#39;t soften but Arnold knew that he was done.  <br />
<br />
Arnold dropped away from his lap and laid his face and chest on the floor.  Tyler didn&#39;t slow his pace at all.  If anything, he sped up jackhammering in and out of his father. <br />
<br />
Finally, he tensed and cane pumping deep inside his father.  <br />
<br />
Arnold felt disgusting, used, and broken but he felt confident.   He had beat the odds and whatever punishment had been planned for him wasn&#39;t going to happen.  As he lay panting, the oven timer for the pizza went off.  <br />
<br />
Arnold sat up a little dizzily and noticed the disappointed look on Beth&#39;s face.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry honey you lose.&quot; She said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I didn&#39;t. I did exactly what the card said.&quot; Arnold retorted.  <br />
<br />
Beth pointed over at Stephen who was laying on the coucb idly tapping on the computer.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You had to get all the guys off,&quot; Beth said. <br />
<br />
As Arnold watched, Stephen typed the last few things and then pressed enter.  Slowly closing his laptop on his chest, Stephen laid down on the couch and fished out his dick and glared at Arnold.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing this!&quot;Arnold said, but his voice was not his own.   It was higher, and squeakier, and had a slight lisp.  <br />
<br />
Arnold stood up and was immediately off balance.  He was shorter, and his center of gravity was off.  Behind him, his ass cheeks were two perfect fleshy bubbles.  Looking down in front of himself, his torn briefs were gone and in their place was a tiny light blue jock strap.  The polo shirt he had been wearing was now a fluorescent yellow with the image of a baseball catcher on it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Read what the card says Beth.&quot; Arnold commanded in the most authoritative voice he could muster.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, looks like you&#39;re still in last place but now you don&#39;t mind bring on the bottom.  Embrace your role as free cutest, twinkiest powerbottom ever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Arnold felt felt himself go pale. <br />
<br />
But then, he noticed that Stephen still has his dick out.  He clambored onto the couch and straddled the cock reverse cowboy and began to fuck himself on it.  It felt so good he always felt so happy when he had a dick in his boypussy. <br />
<br />
Arnie moaned enjoying the wet, slapping sounds of his writhing hole.   He looked at his boys and said to them, &quot;Joey, thanks for coming for me when I asked and Tyler, I loved getting ridden by that big leaking cock of yours.&quot; He punctuated his sentence with a smack of his lips.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Beth said, &quot;Oh, boys I forgot your rewards for helping. Because you helped Arnie discover his place in the world, you both get rewarded for things that he liked.&quot; From now on Joey, you will be more obedient to your father and Tyler,  because he liked you leaking cock you&#39;re going to leak some more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s reward was more pronounced.   Two dark spots began forming on his chest almost immediately.  Tyler pulled off the flannel shirt to reveal that where two normal nipples once were, two one inch long cocks were now leaking down onto their areolas.  He lightly rubbed one and it began to spurt just a little bit. Eliciting a deep moan from the tall man. <br />
<br />
Arnie noticed his sons condition and he said to Joey, &quot;Go clean your brother up.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
Joey immediately got up and went to Tyler and took the dick that was coated in his father&#39;s fluids and began to lick it clean.   After he efficiently did.that, he licked the dribbles off his chest and then sat down without a word or a complaint.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Arnie felt Stephen empty himself inside him so he hopped off and leaned against the table.  One word to Joey and he was thrusting in and out of him at a measured pace with a blank, contented look on his face.  Over Arnie&#39;s moans, it was possible to hear the sounds of the smoke detector beginning to register the burning pizza that everyone in the game had forgotten.</p>
