<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Alright Adam” Max said through his piss slit, “Since you were just in me, I figure it’s mah turn to get in you. Plus, I know you ain’t much of a bottom, and after what you an Alex were doin to me for the last hour, I can promise ya I ain’t gonna last long the first go around.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me Papa” Adam said, getting on hands and knees and pointing his butt toward Max.<br />
<br />
Brian, Brad, and Luke just chuckled to themselves. They stripped out of the clothes they had worn for the drive and sat on the couch, readying themselves for the show.<br />
<br />
“And Alex, would you be so kind as ta pick me up and shove me inside yer boyfriend?”<br />
<br />
“With pleasure Papa” Alex said, kneeling before the talking cock. Alex placed one hand on Adam’s butt cheek, the other hand wrapped around the shaft of Max’s body and lifted him off the ground. Max’s balls were tight against the shaft of his body, and a steady stream of precum poured from his slit. He really wasn’t going to last long.<br />
<br />
“Oh Gods, I ferget how sensitive I am like this” Max moaned. “Careful not ta squeeze me too hard Alex, else I might shoot before I get in him. Now, make sure ta point me at his hole, I got a lot of pre I’m gunna lube ‘im up with” And Max spit a copious amount of precum right at Adam’s butthole, making Adam gasp. “Yeah, rub it around an inside of him. I got more where that came from.”<br />
<br />
Brad, Brian, and Luke laughed. All three were erect from the show, and from the anticipation of getting a sentient cock inside of them.<br />
<br />
Max spit another glob of pre onto Adam’s hole. Alex brought Max closer, rubbing the head of Max’s body around his boyfriend’s tight and rarely penetrated ring.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, boy, that’s real nice. I don’t know if I can take much mormmmph” Max was cut short as Alex shoved all seven and a half inches inside of his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, oh God, oh God” Adam moaned. “He’s cumming!”<br />
<br />
“I know. I can see it” Alex said. “His balls are contracting as he shoots in you”.<br />
<br />
Adam felt the familiar tingle throughout his body that Max’s first load of cum always caused on these weekends. Max enchanted himself so that the first load he dropped in each of the guys made them, for lack of better terminology, consistently horny for the entirety of their stay. Luckily it was only the first load that did it, otherwise by the end of the weekend the men would be mindless sex addicted husks, only good for fucking and being fucked. No, the load slowly making its way through Adam’s body would make sure he was ready for any of the games Max wanted to play that weekend, and by sometime Monday morning, he would be back to normal.<br />
<br />
“I think he’s finished shooting in you babe” Alex said to the panting Adam.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it feels like it” Adam responded.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to take him out, okay?” Alex asked.<br />
<br />
“Okay, but go slow okay? He’s still rock hard.” Adam said.<br />
<br />
“Ha! I should hope so! He still has four guys to load up!” And with that, Alex grabbed Max by the base of the shaft and began pulling him out of Adam.<br />
<br />
“Uhhhn, ohhh, oh God...” Adam moaned as Max slipped out.<br />
<br />
“My Gaaaaaaaaawd Adam. I ferget how tight that ass of yours is! And Alex, you surprised me there! I was hopin&#39; to get at least a couple a pumps in him before I shot my wad!” Max exclaimed. Adam turned to face his boyfriend holding their mentor by the balls, and both men chuckled. “Alright boys, let’s get the rest of ya filled up. Don’t you worry, each one’ll be just as big as what I shot in Adam here. I supercharged my balls for five rounds of mah libido increasing spunk before ya got here. Alex, Brad, and Brian, if you wouldn’t mind kneelin’ in a line over the back of the couch there and pointin’ yer pretty butts at me, I’ll get ya taken care of. Adam, you’ll have the honors of pumpin’ me in an out of em. Luke, if you would be so kind as to milk the fella I’m fuckin’, that should make em squeeze me real good and speed up the process. Then you get three loads a cum in yer belly before dinner.”<br />
<br />
“Gladly!” Luke exclaimed, sliding off the couch. Brad and Brian both turned to kneel over the back of the couch, presenting themselves. Alex handed Max off to Adam and joined them on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Alright Brad,” Max said. “Yer next. My pre has some magic in it and it’ll loosen ya up. Luke, assume yer position, and Adam, line me up with Brad’s hole.”<br />
<br />
Luke slid up the couch in between Brad’s legs as Adam approached. He grabbed Brad’s eight inch cut cock at the base and gave it a lick.<br />
“Uhn. Tease.” Brad laughed. Luke laughed as well before taking the head into his mouth. Meanwhile Adam was lubing Max up with his own precum.<br />
<br />
“Oh, oh yeah. That’s it boy. Rub me good.” Max moaned. Precum spilled down the shaft. “Alright alright, that should be good. Line me up with Brad’s hole. There we go. And...” Max spit a glob of pre on Brad’s hole, making Brad moan. “Alright, rub me around. Uhhh, there we go. I think that should so it. You ready Brad?”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir” Brad affirmed.<br />
<br />
“Good boy. Alright Adam, shove me in.” Max said. Adam steadied Max’s head with one hand, and with his other wrapped around the base, forced Max inside Brad.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhhhh how I’ve missed this dick” Brad moaned.<br />
<br />
“An I missed yer furry butt” Max said with Brad’s voice. “Hey Adam, it’s Max. I came so quick in ya I didn’t get a chance to use this little trick... ohhh yeah. Sorry, Brad’s massaging me real good and it’s real warm in here. Anyway, I thought if I could communicate with ya I could tell ya how to pump me best so I can get ta cummin in these fellas. Normally I like to make it last, but we got work to do. Alright, now, all the way in.... uhhhn, yeah. Now just hold me here. Brad’s squeezing me real good. Damn yer hole feels nice boy.”<br />
<br />
“You feel pretty great too Papa” Brad replied.<br />
<br />
“Alright, start pumpin me. Slow at first and build up some... uhhn, yeah. Some momentum. Gawd you boys know how to make a dick feel good. Luke, give him everything ya got. I’m sure him clenchin’ me when he cums will be more’n enough to milk a load out of me.” Alex and Brian watched the spectacle, anxious for their turn with their mentor. Brian in particular was enjoying hearing Max’s mannerisms and instructions on how best to use his cock body to fuck Brad coming from Brad’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Adam continued to pump Max in and out of Brad. He varied the speed and the rhythm, he withdrew him almost completely then shoved him back in, and he lightly tickled Max’s balls. Meanwhile Luke, being incredibly turned on by the whole scenario, was giving the blowjob of his life. Moans and grunts were all that came out of Brad, and no one knew it was Brad or Max doing the moaning and grunting.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Ohhh, Ohhhh Luke. That’s it! Oh God I’m close. Oh Luke, I’m gonna... I’m gonna... I’m cumming! Unnnnggggaaaaaaah yeah boy, milk me! I’m gonna fill you right up! Shove me in him Adam! Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck yeah....” Brad’s eyes closed in bliss. Luke slid out from between his legs to sit on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Alright, pull me outta him. I think it’s Brian’s turn” Max instructed with Brad’s voice. In one slow yet fluid motion Adam withdrew Max, who was still hard as a rock. Brad collapsed on the couch, enjoying the post orgasm bliss and the tingly feeling of Max’s spunk traveling throughout his body.<br />
<br />
It was the same with Brian and Alex. Luke between their legs sucking for all he was worth, Adam pumping Max in and out, and Max using the voice of the man he was in to give instructions on the best way to make him cum. Before long Alex was shooting down Luke’s throat and Max was depositing his fourth magical load. Luke slid his lips up and off of Alex’s cock and melted to the floor. He lay on his back in a blissful haze, thanks to the three sizeable loads of cum in his belly. He hadn’t noticed that Adam had withdrawn Max from Alex.<br />
<br />
“What a good boy Luke, assuming the position. I’m bettin’ you boys are hungry, so let’s get you loaded up. Lift yer legs so I can see yer hole. That’s it. Good boy.” Max cooed as Adam knelt to the ground. Adam lined Max up, and like all the others Max spit precum on Luke’s hole. Adam rubbed Max around, smearing the impromptu lube, before sliding Max into the young muscular blonde. <br />
--<br />
Luke laid back panting with Max still firmly planted inside him. All five men had a load of Max’s magical spunk in them, and the erections to show it. Though the long weekend wasn’t all about sex, this insured there would be no cases of limp dick, extended post orgasm recovery, or any of the six men “not being in the mood”.<br />
<br />
Max loved the feeling of his cock body compressed on all sides by Luke’s tight warm hole. He was still erect, of course, but with no one pistoning him in and out of Luke, he was free to enjoy the intimate closeness of being almost completely inside of Luke, his balls snuggled up against Luke’s cheeks. But there were pressing matters. Max concentrated on the reversal spell, and just as fast as he had become his own cock Max felt his body expanding and his point of view rapidly shifted from inside of Luke to looking down on him.<br />
<br />
“Hey Papa” Luke smiled, Max was back and Max’s dick was still in him. Max leaned down and kissed Luke while he withdrew his cock.<br />
“Hey yourself sexy” Max cooed to Luke. Max stood, “And kudos to whoever it was that thought ta corkscrew me around into Luke here. That was somethin’ else!” The men laughed.<br />
<br />
“You should have felt it from my end” Luke said with a wink.<br />
<br />
“I just might before this weekend’s over cutie” Max replied with a wink of his own. “Boys, I’m bettin yer starvin’. Now that I got mah stomach back I know I sure am. Who’s ready for dinner?” <br />
--<br />
Max led his guests to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“What’s with the sheet on the floor?” Adam asked, pointing to the corner.<br />
<br />
“You’ll find out soon enough pup” Max said with a laugh. “I bet yer all starvin’! Before I get you boys some grub, how about a round of shots?” Max gestured to six shots glasses lined up on the counter of the kitchen island. He deliberately grabbed the last one in the line. “Whiskey, just like I know you boys like!”<br />
<br />
The five men each picked up a glass and held it in toast to their mentor. The rims clinked together, “To Max!” they all exclaimed. The bottoms of six shot glasses hit the counter, and the men took their whiskey. <br />
<br />
“Aghhhh. Good stuff!” Max said, wiping his lips with the back of his hand. “Now, one last thing before dinner is served. I’m sure you boys are wondering how this weekend is gonna go. While I could just cast a bunch a spells all weekend long, that tends ta take it out of me. And I wanna enjoy you boys. No sir, this time, I’ve spent the past couple a weeks workin on a plan for this weekend” Max said, and turned to a large kitchen cabinet. He opened the door and began taking small labeled jars out that contained white pills and setting them on the counter. “Sugar pills! I been workin magic into these. Different transformations and different durations.” He picked up one jar with the label “Adam+Alex”. “See, this one here is for yer trail ride tomorrow. Each pill will last ya an hour an a half. Enough time to get up to the lake for a picnic, then enough time to get back down to the cabin. Smart, eh? The best part is I been workin’ on these periodically over the last couple a weeks so I could be fully recharged and ready for ya.” Max picked up the jar labeled “Brad+Brian+Luke”, “And this one is for you fellas while Alex and Adam are off bein all romantic. These’ll do ya for an hour a piece, so you should have no problem getting inside of each other while the lovebirds are out.”<br />
<br />
Sure enough, along with the jars Max had pointed out, there were jars labeled “Thursday Night”, “Friday Night”, “Saturday Afternoon”, “Saturday Night”, “Sunday Afternoon”, and “Sunday Night”. “I figured mornings could be a bit of a free fer all. Y’all want a transformation, I can work something up. Else, you can relax and recover from the night before in yer human skin.” Max said, beaming with how well he had planned this weekend.<br />
<br />
All five men were practically dripping they were so turned on by the surprise planned out for them. “But what about Thursday?” Adam asked. “There’s only one pill in that jar.”<br />
<br />
“That’s cuz you pups already took yer pills. Ground up in the whiskey” Max said with a chuckle. “I’m surprised you hadn’t noticed your fur growin’ in!” The men looked down, and sure enough fur was growing in all up their chests. Adam, Alex, and Brian has already grown sheaths around their cocks. “Now it’s about time for dinner I suppose.” Max said as he walked to the sheet on the floor in the corner. He bent down, and in a quick motion revealed six dog bowls, five black and one red, filled to the brim. “Brad, I knew yer a vegetarian so you get the red bowl. We’ve all got brown rice, carrots, and broccoli. Brad, you got zucchini and spinach as well, and fer us meat eaters a boiled chicken breast all atop the finest kibble money can buy. I got a five gallon jug of water for us, and a doggie door in the back for when ya need to empty yer bladders or pop a squat. It’ll be easier clean up in the morning if’n we all number two in the same spot, but I want you boys to mark up the joint outside. Sometimes I like to put on the dog while I’m up here by myself, and it’s nice to smell you boys even when you’re not here.” <br />
<br />
By now all five men were well on their way to all fours. Adam and Luke sported yellow coats of fur from the neck down. Brian and Alex were covered in short black fur. Brian’s ears had shifted upwards and flopped over, while Alex no longer had hands; he had front paws. Brad sported a deep brown coat of fur that contrasted nicely with what little white human skin he had left. All five men wagged their newly acquired tails.<br />
<br />
“These pills will last 14 hours, so we can have all the fun we want tonight and be back on two legs in time for breakfast. I figured it’s pretty warm this time a year so we wouldn’t need much fur, so a night as a bunch a goofy Labradors would be tha perfect way to loosen y’all up and start this vacation right.”<br />
<br />
Max now stood in front of five mostly formed Labrador Retrievers. They had all given up and fallen to all fours. From the neck down they were all dog, but by some coincidence of magic they retained their human heads for the finale. Max watched as noses turned black, ears migrated to the tops of heads and grew out, flopping over. Noses, mouths, and chins grew outward from their skulls forming muzzles, and long pink tongues stretched out as the men panted their approval of their new temporary bodies.<br />
<br />
“Sit boys” Max commanded. All five dogs obediently sat in synch in front of Max. “Good boys! Once I put mah fur coat on and we finish dinner I’ll show ya where I stashed the jerky. Upstairs we got rope for tug-a-war, bones to chew on, some of those Kong things filled with peanut butter, and our tail holes are extra stretchy to accommodate each others’ knots.” Max said with a wink. He grabbed the “Thursday Night” jar and upended it, sending the last white pill into his palm. “Now you boys have about a half hour on me, so I’ll still be a dog fer a bit after ya change back. I wouldn’t object if’n you wanted to toss a Frisbee or a ball around for me in the mornin’ before I’m back on two legs.”<br />
<br />
With that, Max’s swallowed the little white pill that would turn him into a chocolate lab until early the next morning.<br />
<br />
Max gave a quiet moan as dark brown fur covered his ballsack. The fur kept spread to this inner thighs and around his butt, but Max focused on his cock. The tip grew out, losing definition. His shrunk by about an inch, which made sense since labs were a smaller medium sized breed. Not like when he went Great Dane, that change easily packed on another three inches, if not more. A fold of skin and fur, his sheath, started growing at the base up around his shaft until his cock was completely hidden inside. <br />
<br />
His hands tingled and they contracted and shifted into paws. Fingers shrunk as fingernails grew out in small black points. Brown fur covered his paws and raced up his arms as the muscle mass shifted. Max’s upper arms shrank as his chest barreled out. Three new sets of nipples grew out, and were quickly covered by his growing fur. His toes started shrinking next, feet contracted in and his knees reversed knocking him off his bi-pedal stance. Max fell forward, catching himself on his front paws. Thighs grew wide and powerful while the muscles of his butt thinned. Max moaned again as his spine started stretching out into a foot long tail. Just like with the other men, everything from his neck down was all dog, but his head remained human. The brown fur raced up his neck and around his ears as they grew out and flopped down. It kept growing down his forehead as his nose stretched out into my muzzle. Max’s tongue grew long, flat, and dexterous as his jaw lengthened. His nose turned damp and black, and a flood of new smells, including the aroma of five aroused dogs, washed over him. Max was a pretty laid back guy anyway, but as a lab he felt his cares slip away. He looked at each of the men, now dogs, his pack; sitting in front of him. Tongues hung from their mouths as they panted, waiting for the next command from their mentor, their leader, their alpha. Max felt pure joy radiate throughout his body.<br />
<br />
“Alright pups!” Max barked. “Let’s eat!”</p>
