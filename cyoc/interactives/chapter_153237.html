<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Spider woke up from one of the best nights rests in a long time... I mean the bed was considerably better and the air was a lot cleaner than in his apartment... But usually he&#39;d have more restless nights and wake up early. However the sun was high in the sky as Mr. Spider looked out of the window. Getting out of bed Mr. Spider&#39;s boxers fell to the ground, and then Mr. Spider remembered the details... Yeah That Clownfish villain had messed with his genetics... He turned into a woman... and now the power is running it&#39;s course and for some reason shrank. Her hips scrawny, her chest... a little different than when she was a guy but about the same size..., and going to the bathroom and looking in the mirror... Young... <br />
<br />
Mr. Spider didn&#39;t even try for her old costume, if her boxers didn&#39;t fit no way would the costume itself fit. Instead he just took one of the uniforms in the closet. Was kind of like sweat clothes but more durable, and with a P on the shirt. Miraculous weaving it was that let those things be more or less one size fits all... From an adult woman to a child. That goop made her hair color... notably unnatural, but it wasn&#39;t any longer... or girlish... Well maybe Mr. Spider can convince people that she&#39;s a tomboy... outside of Doctor Doctor who&#39;ll take this secret of theirs to the grave... But first an ability stretch/check. A quick jump, walk across the walls... Great the webs are coming out, but not as strong or concentrated... figures... and as for strength... Well nothing to really test super strength with in this little room so... later in the training room. Regardless Mr. Spider was dressed and ready to barge in on Doctor Doctor and intrigue him enough to study her seemingly unstable body. Run out the door, find her way to Doctor Doctor&#39;s room with minimal interruptions, and barely care about any odd looks she gets from most of the minor heroes around. <br />
<br />
*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!!!* &quot;DOCTOR DOCTOR! I need your help!&quot; Mr. Spider asked with urgency in her little girl voice. <br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor opened the door and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I have a deal to help teach the.&quot; <br />
<br />
A young but slightly more mature voice than Spider&#39;s said &quot;You can do your business Doc, I&#39;m just doing these practice problems right now! Besides we&#39;re what a year or two ahead in the curriculum?&quot; <br />
<br />
Spider leaned her head in and to her fears saw that it was Red 6 the leader of the Magical Girl Squad... Shoot Spider had trained her a bit, can&#39;t let her know that Mr. Spider was now little girl spider. Spider said &quot;Umm... Well I can always come ba-&quot; <br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor sighed and said &quot;Come in Miss, We&#39;ll take care of your inquiries. I can take care of two brats at once.&quot; The Spider went inside and saw Red 6 in her uniform. The standard parts were evident, a frilly dress, stockings, and gloves. All colored Red as the primary color with White hints here and there. Then came the nonstandard parts like the ribbons sewing shut the bottom of the frilly dress along with the ribbons keeping the looser parts of the uniform taught, and making for a nice bow on her hair and around her collar... and thanks to the Purifier Scandal she didn&#39;t even have hints of puberty yet despite being of age. <br />
<br />
Red 6 a little annoyed said &quot;I&#39;m not a Brat!&quot; <br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor said &quot;Yes you are. Now finish your problems while we complete our little friend&#39;s check up shall we?&quot; <br />
<br />
Red 6 asked &quot;You got a code name yet Miss?&quot; Spider shook her head in an attempt to seem nervous and unsure... wasn&#39;t quite an act, but Red 6 did look bigger than Spider so... act like a little girl who would be nervous and unsure here. Doctor Doctor took some blood and was doing some lab work, Red 6 did her problems, and Mr. Spider just twiddled her legs unsure of what exactly she should be doing. Praying that she&#39;ll turn back to normal soon? Red 6 scribbled the last part of her problems and stretched her arms saying &quot;Finished! Say what are you even testing for Doc?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor thought for a second and said &quot;I&#39;ll check your work later... Let&#39;s just say our friend here has somewhat similar powers to Mr. Spider and I&#39;m just comparing DNA... It&#39;s fascinating I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s possible she could eclipse Mr. Spider.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. Spider concerned asked &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor with a grin on his face said &quot;Well, female spiders in general are bigger than the males... I&#39;m curious whether or not that could be the same.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. Spider could only think &quot;...As long as you don&#39;t hope to test this... I need to become a man again and sooner rather than later.&quot; <br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor asked &quot;When does the Magical Girl Squad reconvene?&quot; <br />
<br />
Red 6 stated &quot;After the rest&#39;s middle school today, we&#39;ll meet up at central park and do our patrol and training if nothing happens.&quot; <br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor said &quot;Well, while I&#39;m helping our dear friend here with her problem. I was thinking we could add her in as a temporary member of MGS 626. Think you can handle another Brat you self proclaimed non-brat?&quot; <br />
<br />
Red 6 thought for a moment and said &quot;I mean... She&#39;s younger... Will you let me test her out in the gym to get an idea of what she can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor responded &quot;Go Ahead, She&#39;s all yours. Go ahead and ask Arachne to make her a magical girl uniform... and don&#39;t skimp out on the frills.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. Spider said &quot;I didn&#39;t agree to-&quot; Hyper Instincts kicked in and Mr. Spider jumped as she saw a snare made out of an ornate red ribbon pull away. Then looked and saw Red 6 have some ribbons extending from her and coming towards Mr. Spider. For sure Red 6 got a decent idea of how... energetic Mr. Spider was as a little girl considering she couldn&#39;t get her relatively quick ribbons anywhere near Mr. Spider. <br />
<br />
Red 6 retracted her ribbons and said &quot;Come on Spiderling! It was originally a trick to get you to come without a fuss, but your fast enough...  May have her do an arm wrestle against you to test your strength but...&quot; Red 6 took a breathe as the little encounter had winded her and continued &quot;...feel free to join our team. So are you going with MG Spider or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Spider said &quot;If we&#39;re in New York I think I&#39;d rather distance myself from Mr. Spider. Wouldn&#39;t want anyone thinking I&#39;m his daughter or something right?.. Maybe something like-&quot; <br />
<br />
Red 6 said &quot;Nothing wrong with being somewhat associated with Mr. Spider. Heck I kind of know him. I could probably introduce you two if he ever swings nearby.&quot; she checked her watch and then said &quot;But I think it&#39;s about time we headed to Central Park for our meeting. Their class has ended and we need to get there ASAP... Do you have webs or something?&quot; Mr. Spider knowing her Spider powers were already outed tried to spew out some, but on the look on Red 6&#39;s and Doctor Doctor&#39;s faces told her that those webs wouldn&#39;t really be useful for moving around the city with. &quot;...Well... Your fast and I&#39;m not the best swinger either yet so... let&#39;s run!&quot; Red 6 said as she ran to the park leaving Mr. Spider to run after her.</p>
