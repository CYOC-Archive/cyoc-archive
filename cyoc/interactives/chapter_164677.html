<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">SUNDAY (AM)<br />
<br />
&quot;Ngh... So hot!&quot; Lauren moaned in her sleep, kicking the blankets off of her and Peter in the process. She was completely unaware of her new coat of fur and so was Peter as he slept beside her with his changed arms.<br />
<br />
Soon Peter began to shiver, growing cold in response to his lack of blankets. His eyes began to shutter open as he looked around for the sheets, finding them nowhere to be seen. He rolled over to flick the light on, noticing his arms felt strange and awkward to maneuver. He groans, assuming the worst as he flicked the light switch. The room fills with light, confirming Peter&#39;s fears. <br />
<br />
His arms had changed overnight. He assumed it had happened early that morning, never considering it may have happened last night. As he finally gets over the shock of his changed arms he looks to Lauren, seeing the hairy equine woman that lay before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ngh... why&#39;d you turn the light on?&quot; She asked, before looking over her body. She screamed just a little before covering her mouth with her thankfully hairless hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww fuck.&quot; Lauren exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay though. We should be there tomorrow, just a little further to go.&quot; He said with a hopeful smile. He walked over to the blankets, spreading them over the bed as he turned the lights off, getting back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter... You can just have them all... I&#39;m... too warm.&quot; Lauren said, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Peter replied, gently removing the covers off of Lauren while wrapping himself tight as they both faded off to sleep.<br />
<br />
They awoke the next morning, getting up at sunrise. They stared at each other awkwardly before getting dressed and heading downstairs. They stopped in at the breakfast buffet, stuffing their faces before heading back to reception. They were greeted by the same lady who checked them in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Your car is just out front. Here are your keys. The mechanic dropped them off not half an hour ago.&quot; She said, handing the keys off to Lauren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you see him you&#39;ll have to thank him for us.&quot; She replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be sure too. You kids have a nice trip.&quot; She said as they headed out of the door. <br />
<br />
They approach the car, deciding that it would be better for Lauren to drive, at least while Peter got used to his new arms. After about three hours of driving they passed a road sign, indicating that they were nearly there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only a few more hours! We should get there by the late afternoon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! Let&#39;s just hope the traffic stays like this; I haven&#39;t seen a car in over an hour.&quot; She says.<br />
<br />
Peter begins to take his jersey off, seemingly sweating a little. &quot;Is... Is it hot in here to you?&quot; He asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Yeah, but it&#39;s hot everywhere I go now.&quot; She said, pointing to her coat of fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Well it&#39;s definitely getting warmer in here. He began. Lauren turned the air conditioner down, waiting for his complaining to stop when suddenly her jeans felt tight.<br />
<br />
She wriggled around in them, trying her best to get comfortable, though they still kept getting tighter. <br />
<br />
&quot;P-peter... I think I&#39;m changing!&quot; She yelled as she pulled over to the side of the road, slamming the brakes on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? No, it&#39;s too soon!&quot; He yelled, though in the panic something caught his attention. His arms were growing hair and at a rapid rate. He looked down at his legs and everywhere else he could see <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! My ass... It&#39;s too tight. I need to get out of these clothes!&quot; Lauren yelled as she scrambled from the car. Peter was soon to follow, with all the fur he was growing underneath his clothing he felt hot, as well as an uncontrollable itch. <br />
<br />
Soon the couple was out of the car, frantically grabbing at their clothing as they threw it to the ground. Peter was first undressed, his clothes coming off with ease, as he sat there on the side of the road in nothing but his underwear. Lauren on the other hand struggled with her jeans. She had managed to get them unzipped but even then it already too tight. <br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not coming off!&quot; She moaned over the sounds of tearing fabric. The jeans split straight down the backside, giving view to a strained pair of panties below.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; He moaned as Lauren leant against the car, pushing her ass out while waiting for the inevitable. Her hips grew wider still, pushing the waistband apart, beyond breaking point, the fabric was so stretched it was basically see through. She looked behind her to find her boyfriend, stunned. <br />
<br />
He stood there, covered in fur with a massive erection that bulged from his underwear. She could feel herself growing wet, despite everything that was going on around her.<br />
<br />
Intentionally she spread her legs further, her random grunts of pain transitioned to precise moans of pleasure. She knew it would be long now until she heard it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Riiiip!&quot; It was the sound of Lauren&#39;s jeans finally giving way to her expanding ass. Lauren felt the pressure release, her jeans dropping in tatters around her ankles. Her underwear sharing a similar fate as it to flew off in the chaos.<br />
<br />
Now all she could do was pray. She hoped Peter would take this hint, to go over there and mount her. She longed for his touch. Her heart leapt when she felt his hand on her bare ass. He trailed his finger down her ass crack, slipping it gently into her pussy. It was dripping wet. <br />
<br />
Her body trembled with lust, begging him to go on. Peter was happy to oblige, grasping his equine shaft he directed its head towards Lauren&#39;s opening. Once again it slid in with ease as the couple began their second sexual encounter since their transformation had begun.<br />
<br />
They were lucky traffic was quiet, so no one passed these two people while they had sex on the side of the road. They stood there, naked and furry on the highway in the midday sun. Both of them were working up a sweat. <br />
<br />
Lauren&#39;s donkey jaw hung wide open as she was pounded by Peter&#39;s massive thrusts, with each one he took, the deeper he ended up inside her. Beneath them on the dusty ground was a puddle of sweat and sexual fluid, the result of Lauren&#39;s orgasms, though it was nearing Peter&#39;s time to contribute.<br />
<br />
He grunted wildly as his rhythm became strained and random, before surprisingly he came. Dropping his own human jaw Peter groaned, his eyes rolling back into his head as he exploded. He dug his hooves deep into the ground as he made sure Lauren took as much as she could. <br />
<br />
They remained there together until Peter finally withdrew his dick, the excess semen splattered sloppily on the floor, adding to their mess. They were both still recovering, breathing heavily as they smiled awkwardly to one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... Huff... Getting worse.&quot; Peter said, though Lauren didn&#39;t answer. &quot;I think we should get changed...&quot; Peter said. Lauren nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
They opened the boot of their car and rummaged through their belongings in an attempt to find something more suitable to wear. Peter decided upon a pair of loose shorts and a singlet, while Lauren decided on something a little looser fitting.<br />
<br />
She wore a light blue dress, which sat comfortably over her new ass. Lauren got back into the car with Peter in pursuit as the pair continued their drive in silence for most of the trip.</p>
