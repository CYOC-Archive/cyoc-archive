<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Kyle have begun to mellow out into your new identities. There are times when you act more like Nathan rather than Eugene. And sometimes, you would even forget that you are not the owner of this body. But seeing the app on your phone quickly reminds you of the fact. Well… Other than the sex you and Kyle would usually do whenever the adults are not looking. The real Kyle and Nathan would never do that. <br />
<br />
While you two were cleaning each other in the shower after a steamy session under the bleachers, Kyle asked you about the app. It came out of the blue and you didn&#39;t expect him to ask about it again. He seems happy as Kyle, and you never really thought he&#39;d ask you to use it again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Nathan…&quot; Kyle called. You looked at him and saw his more mature face than yours. A few more years and you&#39;d be like him. &quot;Have you used the app other than the time I used it to become Kyle?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; A simple nope. &quot;I thought of deleting it because I&#39;m quite happy as Nathan now. But the app doesn&#39;t let me. Why do you ask?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just… I got this idea yesterday. Where I use the app to take your picture, and you use it to take mine.&quot; <br />
<br />
You thought of it. That means you&#39;d wake up in his body and he&#39;d wake up in yours. &quot;We&#39;d swap bodies, that&#39;s what you&#39;re getting at. To be honest, I think the role of the leader suits you more. Even back when you&#39;re Finn, you tend to boss others around.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean… It&#39;s not permanent. I was just curious how it feels to be on your skin.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;One day. Let&#39;s see how it&#39;ll go.&quot; <br />
<br />
Right after the shower, you took one flattering picture of Kyle naked in the locker room. Then he took one of yours while your legs were spread apart. Of course, the pictures aren&#39;t saved. Although, you wished they were. <br />
<br />
You went back home after school and had dinner with your family where you bragged about becoming the top ranking scores in your entire grade. The only one you&#39;re competing with is, of course, Kyle. It&#39;s just a simple competition between the two of you. No harm, no foul. Although, you know that you&#39;re the better accountant between the two of you. Right after dinner, you buried yourself in the covers of your bed and went to sleep. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
An annoying alarm. There&#39;s a thin slice of sunlight that perfectly aligns with your eyes. You awoke with a fit. Everything felt strange like you&#39;re drenched in the thickest honey. You look around and see yourself in a different yet familiar room. Directly in front of your bed is a mirror, as you&#39;d expected. You&#39;ve been in this situation before. A mirror, a reflection, and the realization that you&#39;re in a different body. And that body would be none other than Kyle. <br />
<br />
You wobbled out of bed while stumbling after several steps. You&#39;ve already gotten used to the small strides of Nathan. Now you&#39;ve got to be used to Kyle&#39;s longer one. After standing, you inspected your new body in the mirror. The first thing you noticed is the height. You&#39;re taller and that means your point of view is a little bit higher. Other than that, your arms and legs are quite larger and thicker than Nathan&#39;s. There are a few patches of hair that are starting to grow in your armpits. When you took a closer inspection, you realized that they stink. <br />
<br />
Pubescence. That&#39;s what this is. Finn should&#39;ve warned him about this. You remembered your first adolescence and it was bad. Hair was growing everywhere, and deodorants barely made a dent in your BO. It was by luck that it didn&#39;t last long. Your growth spurt ended early, and that&#39;s probably why you&#39;re shorter than most of your colleagues. Now that you&#39;re in Kyle&#39;s growing body. You&#39;re shuddering at the thought of experiencing adolescence again. Then you reminded yourself that this isn&#39;t permanent. Only one day in this body and you&#39;ll see how it&#39;ll go. <br />
<br />
You went downstairs to see no one there. Through Kyle&#39;s memories and what Finn mentioned before, both of Kyle&#39;s parents work far away from here. They leave early and come home late. He barely sees them at all. It&#39;s a downer for Kyle and that&#39;s why he seeks joy from his friends. With no people downstairs, it was your job to make breakfast for yourself. Just a simple bowl of milk and cereal. You ate your fill in the deafening silence of the kitchen. You can&#39;t believe it but you&#39;re missing the nagging voice of Nathan&#39;s mother and your older brother&#39;s encouragement whenever you brag about your high scores in algebra. <br />
<br />
Today is a Saturday. Finn probably knows about your soccer practice this morning. So you won&#39;t get to see him until this afternoon. In the meantime, you learned that the Swap Snap app transferred to Kyle&#39;s phone. His device has a PocketGoblin cover although it&#39;s a different kind of Goblin from Nathan&#39;s. Nothing seemed to change from inside the app so you left it untouched. Other than that, you merely slaved the hours watching porn on the Internet but never squeezed out a release. You&#39;re waiting for Finn to do that. <br />
<br />
At noon, Finn finally messaged you that he&#39;ll be coming here. And he said to never bother with lunch since he&#39;ll be buying from a fast food chain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s my allowance,&quot; You messaged him back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. That&#39;s why I&#39;m nonchalant when spending it.&quot; Finn followed with another message. &quot;I also bought you a bunch of proper underwear. I noticed that you&#39;ve grown fast these past few weeks and your current undergarments aren&#39;t fitting right. I can&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn&#39;s quite right. You really didn&#39;t notice that your crotch as Nathan is growing these past few weeks. Although, you did feel some uncomfortable tightness in them. But nothing too big. <br />
<br />
Finn came earlier than expected. He&#39;s wearing a smile on his face he&#39;s borrowing. It&#39;s kind of weird seeing someone else maneuver the body you&#39;ve grown accustomed to these past few weeks. You dismissed the thought and continued feasting on the burgers he brought. It&#39;s not your favorite, but now that you&#39;re Kyle, it now is. The taste of the meat, vegetables, and sauces seems more vibrant than usual. By the time you realize, you&#39;ve already eaten three burgers with a fourth one coming your way. <br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you&#39;d be hungry for burgers,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How many did you buy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve spent half your allowance,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Asshole! It&#39;s only the first week of the month. I won&#39;t get another dime out of my mom until next month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to get the answer from you. You&#39;re still relying on your mom for money?&quot; You nodded. &quot;We&#39;re pubescent teenagers! Do you know how much you can earn to let perverts see your dick on the internet? I began to do it the day after I became Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
You peered at Kyle&#39;s memories and he was right. He&#39;s earning mad bucks just to share pictures of his own penis on the dark web. No wonder Kyle&#39;s fashion became a lot more varied when Finn moved in. You saw how his wardrobe is filled to the brim just this morning. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you can give back the money you&#39;ve spent, then?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve only eaten half a burger and I&#39;m already full. While you&#39;re eating your sixth one. If there&#39;s anyone that needs to pay, it&#39;s you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Touché,&quot; With the last burger and fries finished, you&#39;ve turned your attention to Finn. In the unfocused eye, you won&#39;t realize that it&#39;s a different person inside him. But notice the diction in his voice, the way he carries himself when he walks, the little mannerisms common people won&#39;t notice – everything about it speaks of Finn. <br />
<br />
Finn crawled underneath the table and unzipped and pulled your pajamas. Judging by the way he looked, it seemed he was a little disappointed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t fapped since this morning?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was waiting for you you,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You wai-&quot; Finn cackled. &quot;You were waiting for me? You know Kyle can cum several times in a day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I want all of it to be released inside of you,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Disappointment averted. It&#39;s also one of the reasons why I want to swap with you anyway. I&#39;m always topping you. I want to be at the bottom instead.&quot; Finn pushed his nose upon your crotch. A tiny fabric separates between your penis and his nose. He inhaled deeply and let the smell muster inside him. &quot;But this is the actual reason why I wanted to swap with you. Kyle&#39;s got one heck of a manly smell down here. And it pisses me off that he&#39;s not flexible enough to smell this absolutely delicious musk. But now that we&#39;re swapped, I could smell this as long as I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the thin barrier separating your dick and his nose, you could still feel the movement of the air as he sniffed your crotch. He could barely breathe amid the heaviness of Kyle&#39;s scent, but it didn&#39;t stop him from smelling you. Rather, it made him do it more. <br />
<br />
You looked down and saw Nathan&#39;s puppy-like face feast on the musk of your crotch. He looks so small and delicate. The memories embedded in your muscles seemed to automatically react to his presence. You pinned him to the floor and feasted on the flesh of his neck. He&#39;s sweaty from soccer practice and that made this feast a lot tastier. Finn wriggled out of your hold and pulled your underwear entirely. You did the same by pulling away his uniform and pants. He&#39;s bare and he looks so vulnerable in the position. His gaping body was an open invitation for you to lick his nipples. But somehow, your mind barred you from it. Licking nipples is something you as Nathan would do. But you&#39;re Kyle. Finn asked you to lean against the wall while he tongued your nipples. He made his way down to your dick, where he led his tongue on your shaft. His mouth is small but he managed to swallow it all. He must be using the skills you&#39;ve acquired from sucking Kyle&#39;s cock for weeks. He knew where to lick directly so he could squeeze most moans out of you. Is this what he felt like when you&#39;re sucking him? Fuck! This is equally as good as getting your mouth filled. <br />
<br />
With a lubed-up dick, you easily plucked him out of your crotch and propped his ass in front of you. By now, Nathan&#39;s ass is properly loosened. You could insert two of your fingers from the get-go. You know the contents of this plump ass better than anyone else. You rubbed the most delicate part of his prostate and doing that alone made him cum on the floor. <br />
<br />
*Fu– ffuck! Ah!! Ah!&quot; Finn moaned in Nathan&#39;s voice. &quot;Warn me next time before you do that, asshole.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Putting two of my fingers inside your asshole is not a warning enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
With his ass properly loosened, you asked Finn to sit down on your throbbing dick. He squatted right in front of you, and slowly slid the shaft right up his bum. Oh, how fucking right it was. His dick feels like it&#39;s being sandwiched between two flaming hot slabs of meat. Oh, how he could feel the ridges of the asshole as it rubbed down his shaft. Fuck! He could even feel the tip rub past the edges of his intestine. Finn slammed his entire dick and rose, before slamming it back. Skin upon skin slapped together. The room is filled with your uncaring moans. You wrapped yourself around his neck and gave him a bullet of kisses. You finally understood why he liked to lather with his saliva. It&#39;s because you&#39;re one hell of a fine meal. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m close,&quot; you whispered to him with crackling undertones. &quot;I&#39;m fucking close.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I– I know. Your dick is throbbing like crazy.&quot; <br />
<br />
You closed your eyes and lost yourself to the screams. Your dick felt like it was going to explode. Your cum spurred forth like the 4th of July. In what little moments your eyes were open, you saw that Finn was cumming as well. Your moans and screams melded into one. It&#39;s a cacophony of pleasures both of you have experienced for the first time. Yo– you could get used to this. Maybe this one day can extend for a few days more? Maybe you can set up a schedule? The thought flowed out of your mind, desperately finding ways to feel this kind of pleasure again. <br />
<br />
You collapsed on Finn. You lay there on the floor with your dick still spouting its last fuel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t sleep, yet. That&#39;s just the first one. By my estimate, you can cum five times more today. Six since you didn&#39;t cum this morning as I expected you to.&quot; <br />
<br />
And so, you did cum six more times in the day. Two on the sofa, three on the bed, and one final one in the shower. The sun had already set by the end of it. And by then, you two were finishing the homework of the other. Despite such personal proximity to one another, it&#39;s best to maintain academic integrity. That means, no cheating. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;re turning back, huh?&quot; Finn asked. <br />
<br />
You had this thought before this afternoon. Should this experience last only for a day, or should it extend for a few days more?</p>
