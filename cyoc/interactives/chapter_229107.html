<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie kept walking, pushing through her tween years.  She got taller and thinner as the last of her baby fat drained out.  As she finally hit her teen years at 13, she felt a tingle in her chest.  She looked down to see that her nipples were making slight indentations in her tank top.  As she walked, her nipples rubbed against her tank top more, feeling more sensitive as they did.  The areas around them started getting more puffy as tissue began forming.  &quot;I&#39;m growing boobies,&quot; said Katie, her mind expanding to explain what puberty is.  The discomfort faded as a training bra appeared under her tank top, comfortably cradling her nascent breasts.<br />
<br />
The beginning of puberty spurred Katie to walk even more, wondering how big she was going to get.  As she continued through her teen years, she gained more height.  Her legs became more shapely as her thighs and hips start filling out.  She could feel her butt growing into a more appealing shape.  Her tank top pulled up more, showing her belly button.  Her training bra became a proper bra as her breasts expanded, putting her into the upper B&#39;s.  Katie&#39;s face got prettier as her lips became fuller and her face started losing its roundness.  Her hair grew longer before a band put it into a ponytail.  At 16, Katie was becoming a looker and she knew it.  &quot;Sweet sixteen and ready to drive,&quot; she said proudly, her voice not sounding as high-pitched as before.<br />
<br />
16 looked good, but there wasn&#39;t quite enough freedom for Katie.  She pushed onward, going through the last of her high school years.  She gained a little more height as her legs grew even more shapely.  She could feel her hips and rear growing out to a childbearing form and a tingle through her groin told her she was fully ready to have children of her own.  Her tank top fully slid up to reveal her flat stomach as it merged with her bra to become a sports bra. <br />
 Her breasts swelled up to C cups as her cleavage became more displayed.  Lipstick and earrings appeared as she pushed past what would have been her high school graduation.  &quot;I&#39;m a legal adult,&quot; said Katie proudly, her voice dropping into a lovely tenor.  At 18, she was now free to pursue adult interests.<br />
<br />
18 may be the age where adult access is unlocked, but 21 is where the fun really starts.  Katie pushed herself to reach that.  Puberty had a last few gifts to give to her before it finished.  Another two inches of height finished her growth.  Her butt, no, her ass was now a perfect peach that any guy would look at.  Though plenty of them would also be watching her tits especially as they swelled into the D class.  Wilder thoughts entered Katie&#39;s mind as new possibilities open.  &quot;I&#39;m going to party hard tonight,&quot; said the 21-year-old college girl.<br />
<br />
Though Katie was a fully grown woman with a sexy figure, something intrigued her.  After all her walking, her muscles weren&#39;t nearly as big as she expected them to be.  She was hardly out of shape, but she would have thought all her walking would be reflected more.  &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can work on that,&quot; she said as she kept walking.  As she walked, she gained more memories of fitness courses and knowledge about physical regiments.  The changes soon became noticeable.  Her shapely legs grew more toned as the years of walking became physically present.  Her arms also thickened as years of workouts were added on.  Her exposed midriff rippled before her abs pushed out, becoming more defined until a hard six-pack was formed.  Katie felt a rush of power as she became a female bodybuilder at 25.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!  Check me out!  I&#39;m so fucking buff!&quot; Katie said as she flexed while continuing her walk.  &quot;I look like some female body builder in the magazine.  Oooo....  I can&#39;t wait for Kellie to see me.  She be so mad jealous!&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment she said that, a small nagging thought came to Katie&#39;s attention.  Her mom was bound to be waiting for her after she finished in the arcade.  Of course, Katie was now way too old to possibly be her daughter.  More likely, she&#39;ll be her sister, her younger sister.  The thought rankled Katie a little over her former mother holding seniority over her.  Maybe just a little more to meet her mother&#39;s age.  A few more years meant more muscles being built.  Her legs thickened even more, yet she retained enough to keep them from looking grotesque.  Her arms grew even more bigger, a very considerable amount of strength being added.  Her abs didn&#39;t look just sculpted, they looked carved.  She had been able to build up a legendary 8-pack to the envy of both men and women.  At 30, no one was going to be pushing Katie around.  &quot;Wait until &#39;Mom&#39; sees her twin,&quot; she said smugly.<br />
<br />
But then a thought occurred to her.  Yes, she is the same age as her mother, but why stop there.  Why be a twin when she can be older then her, more dominant then her.  She can be the one in charge for once and would tell her own mother on what to do.  That would put her in her place.  It will be like Kellie&#39;s own mother telling her what to do.  Katie&#39;s Grandmother...<br />
<br />
Just thinking about that, made her remember about her grandmother, Judy.  Katie never had much of memories of her, but from what Kellie told her, she was a kind and lovely woman, giving Kel the future she never had.  What she knew, she was diagnosed with breast cancer before Kellie had her daughter.  She fought hard just so she can see Katie being born into the world, but it wasn&#39;t in the cards as she passed away a week before the birth.  And last week was the tenth anniversary.  Katie felt sorry as she never had a grandmother to look up to.  But the person who was hurt the most of Kellie as Judy was the only family she had cause of some private family history she doesn&#39;t know about.  And every year when visiting Judy&#39;s grave, Kellie wished she that her mother would return to spend time with them.<br />
<br />
Katie thought of that while walking on that tredmill and an idea struck her.  Kellie misses her own grandmother, why not be the replacement for Judy?  After all, she never knew her own grandmother and the thought of becoming one would be an interesting thing to see.  Not to mention that Kellie would have a grandmother again to be with.  But at what cost?  She walked through her thirties and already have the sculpted body for people to envy about.  If she keeps walking, she will loose what she gained in a matter of minutes.  Will she sacrifice her own body just for Kellie to have a grandmother again?<br />
<br />
Debating her choices, Katie said to herself, &quot;Fuck it.  Let&#39;s give mom the grandmother she lost.  It&#39;s not like I got anything better to do.  Goodbye muscular body, hello love handles and wrinkles.&quot;  And with that, she continued to walk on the treadmill as the forest continues to move forwards on the screen.  Looking at the counter, she watches with satisfaction as she could see her age racing through her thirties.  At the same time, her body was passing her prime as father time was slowly stripping her of her Adonis like body.<br />
<br />
Her breasts soon grew out into a pair of melon size DDs but they were slowly dipping down as if the air they were starting to slowly sag.   Her sculpted abs started to fade away as a small paunch poke out while her sides were gaining a muffin tuff, spilling out the waist band of her gym shorts.  And muscular arms and legs started to soften up as while strong, was showing age.  Her beautiful face was also aging as well as faint lines appeared around her eyes and mouth before they deepen into laugh lines while dark circles appeared under her eyes.  The band of her pony tail snapped as her luscious hair cascaded down to the mid back before reverting itself up to her head, restyling into a bob cut that frames her face.  As the hair started to get duller, a few gray stands started to appear on her head before on the top to form a line.  Reaching the back of her head, it looked like Katie has a gray streak on top of her head that, while makes her old, at the same time beautiful.<br />
<br />
As Katie&#39;s body was aging, her attire was altering to match it.  The bottom hem of her sport bra grew downwards to cover her stomach as the shoulder straps thinned until they were non existence, giving her a strapless green top with ample cleavage.  Her gym shorts grew down her legs and the fabric became Demin, with a zipper and button appearing and a belt looking round her waistline, creating a pair of blue jeans.  The laces of her trainers untie themselves as the laces slithered out and rested on the moving treadmill, vanishing away once they reached the end of it.  The shoes themselves grew upwards to the mid thighs and covered the pants as they turned black with a zipper on the side, creating a pair of cozy boots.  A red business vest was magically woven from existence as the fabric went up her arms and down her body until it stopped below her top, making her look professional.  Make up was automatically applied on her face to cover up her laugh lines as she plucked her lips and the color changed to cherry red.  Her fit bit watch soon turned into a Rolex watch on one arm while a few bracelets appeared on the other.  A silver necklace wrapped around her neck with a green gemstone in the front nestled between her huge boobs.  A guchi bag when magically appeared on her shoulder strap and it was automatically filled with personal items like a wallet with cash, make up back, a collection of keys, and other assortments of things a woman needs.<br />
 And to top it all off, a golden wedding ring with a green diamond appeared on her index finger, signifying that she was married.  After some walking, what was a once 8-year-old girl with a future ahead of her turned into a middle age 40 year old professional woman.  But she wasn&#39;t satisfied with this as she was still old enough to be an older sister for Kellie.  She wanted to be the mother of Kellie so she continued to walk on the treadmill to reach that desired target.<br />
<br />
Going through her forties, Katie felt a little warm and started to fan herself with the color of her green top.  &quot;Goodness...  It&#39;s getting a little hot in here.&quot; she said as her tone and body language keeps changing as she grew older.  &quot;Would it kill for this arcade to have a fan to cool me off?&quot;  Just as she asked that, a built in fan was activated and blew cold air on her face and body, keeping her from burning off.  Katie felt that and said, &quot;Ah...  Much better.  A lady my age should be careful.  These hot flashes can cause a gal like me to pass out.&quot;  Katie soon realized what she said.  Turns out, she was getting to the age where she was going though early menopause in her late forties.  Meaning she&#39;s experiencing old age at an early age.  She would have stopped the treadmill after feeling that.  But if she would do that, she won&#39;t get to the age where she would be suited as a mother for Kellie.  So she continued to walk as she said, &quot;Oh my...  This is something I need to get use to.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she entered her fifties, she could feel her strong and athletic body eroding away.  Her beasts have become E cup as gravity took over and caused them to lower down to her stomach.  Speaking of her stomach, it started to jut forward, pulling bottom of her green strapless top upwards to reveal her gut while the belt and button popped to let the stomach spilled forward.  Her rear was soon inflating like a balloon as it looked like a dump truck while the fatty deposit on the hips were spilling out.  The arms lost most of it&#39;s tone and were getting flabby, looking like Bingo biceps.  Even her legs were joining the increasing waistline, as her thighs were growing heavy cellulite and causing her jeans to rip and tear.  Her face was showing old age as well as all that beauty was sapping away.  The laugh lines deepened into wrinkles as they dominate around her eyes and mouth while some appeared on her forehead.  Her cheeks started to get puffy as a double chin was forming at the bottom of her face.  Her bob cut hair remained the same, but gray streak on the top of her head was spreading to the sides as she loosing more brown in the pigment department.  In the end result, what was once a female body builder in her thirties was now a fat senior citizen in the 50s, clearly the exact opposite form what Katie was was.<br />
<br />
But the body was one part of the change as her clothes were altering to match her body.  Katie&#39;s jeans were on the verge of break until one loud rip and the exploded off her legs, revealing the fatty deposits and veins poppind out of it.  The shreds soon disappeared entirely as it didn&#39;t exist as she was mostly half naked with her underwear being the only thing keeping her indecent.  But that was about to change as the bottom hem of her top was descending back down.  It soon covered her panties and then stopped right at the knees, covering her up nice and snug.  The top soon turned into soft fabric as plants grew on the surface to give her some kind of Mumu dress.  Her red business vest soon grew down to her sides with the fabric becoming knitted wool and the color changing to dark green, creating a handmade jacket out of scratch.  Her boots descended downwards and opened up to reveal her worn feet, coming a pair of comfy shoots with heels rising from the back.  A pair of pantyhose soon materialized from her feet and extended up to into her dress, covering her fat veiny legs.  Most of the jewelry remained the same, but her necklace soon changed into the pearl variety.  Pretty soon, she become a senior citizen in her fifties with most of your youth drained out of her.<br />
<br />
As Katie was fast approaching her sixties, she could feel some pain in her joints and groaned a little.  &quot;Ow...  My legs...  They are starting to hurt.  It&#39;s like I&#39;ve been walking forever.&quot; she said jokingly, as her voice was starting to get  rougher then ever.  What was really happening is that the more she aged, the more her own body was breaking down.  Her legs were starting to get stiff after all the walking on the treadmill as the knees were weakening.  Not only that, but all that weight she was gaining was causing her back to crack and slouched forward.  No doubt, she was going to be needing a crane or walker soon as she was going to collapsed.  But she knew that he must venture onward if she were to get to the age of Kellie&#39;s mother.  So through the pain, she kept on walking as she entered her sixties.<br />
<br />
While her body remained the same, she was still gaining more weight as her breasts keep on drooping, her belly keeps on expanding, and her body weakening.  And the more Katie walked, her more painful it has become.  So much so to the point where she could feel her knees about to buckle.  Groaning from the pain, she said, &quot;Just...a little more...  Knees, don&#39;t fail me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking up to the counter, she could see that she was already in her mid sixties and was slowly increasing.  But as she was looking at it she knees soon gave way and she soon tripped, this in turn lead to her accidently hitting the stop button and the treadmill slowed to a stop, ending the journey.<br />
<br />
Katie groaned and knew that she has reached her walking limit.  Looking, up, she could see her age counter reached senior citizen status as she was now 65-years-old, the perfect age to be Kellie&#39;s mother.  Looking at it, she sighed and said in a raspy voice, &quot;Well, that will do it.  My legs are too tired to walk and my back is killing me.&quot;  Stepping off from the treadmill, she knew that she was feeling stiff and can barely walk anymore.  But as she was getting off, she noticed a walker next to the treadmill.  She looked on and wondered how it get there.  &quot;Strange...  I never seen that walker before.  How did it get there?&quot;  Feeling her knees aching and her bad back, Katie decided to take it so that she won&#39;t have to collapse so easily.  Slowly walking, she got a hold of the walker and felt comfortable.  &quot;Now that&#39;s so much better.  I swear, one more step and I&#39;ll trip and fall.&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon wondered who her body got weak from all the walking until she turned to an arcade cabinet with a screen off.  That&#39;s when she saw something that shocked her the most.  What she saw on the glass reflection was the exact opposite of the Adonis like body builder she once was at thirty.  All of her muscles, abs, and build were long gone and replaced with a fat slouched old lady wearing a mumu and flats.  Her face was worse for wares as well since she has deep wrinkles, puffy cheeks, and a clearly visible double chin.  She could even see a pair of glasses appearing on her face as her eyesight was starting to get weak.  And to make matters worse, her bob cut was all gray with not a single brown strand in sight.  But there is a white streak at the top of her head like before as if it is genetics that her hair changes as she got older.  All and all, Katie looks worse for wear when she saw the end results of walking so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodness me!&quot; she said in shock, &quot;I really must&#39;ve let myself go after pushing thirty huh?  Guess this is what happens when you have a daughter.  It really wears you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as she said that, that thought came right into her head.  Apparently, Katie&#39;s memories and reality were altering completely.  She is no longer thinking herself as the daughter for her mother.  But now, Katie things that Kellie is really her daughter and she is the mother.  Memories were soon pouring into her head as decades of her life wizzed on my.  Her early high school years, dropping out of college, becoming a fitness model, marrying a hot guy, giving birth to Kellie, the divorce, the lack of exercise that lead to her aged body.  Everything going in her head to catch up with her body.  Katie was confused at first, but slowly she was excepting them as her own.<br />
<br />
With a warm smile on her worn face, Katie said, &quot;You know what?  I think it&#39;s for the best.  After all, I need to be very supportive to my own daughter and would sacrifice my own lively hood to make her happy.&quot;  With that, she turned with her walker and slowly walked past all the arcade games just to reach the exit.  &quot;Though...  It would kill bit I can walk better again.  Just the idea on walking with weak knees and a hunched back is really killing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon left the arcade, wondering what to do with her new old life.</p>
