<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BACKTRACKING A BIT...<br />
Eric Anderson and Cassie O&#39;Sullivan laid in each other&#39;s furry arms after a wonderful session of sexual love making.<br />
The newly created werewolf was finding himself rapidly becoming more and more attracted to the she-wolf that inducted him into were society, as well as the 14 year old Freshman underneath all that fur.<br />
Yet, as they were resting, Cassie did have a few questions for her new beau.<br />
&quot;So, I&#39;m not a rebound, and you&#39;re not the type of guy who rebounds to begin with, but just so I&#39;m clear on this once and for all, what was the deal between you and Julie Stovall to begin with?&quot; asked Cassie, turning on her side to look Eric directly in his lupine eyes.<br />
&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; admitted Eric. &quot;I just moved to Moon Lake before the start of the new school year. Didn&#39;t have any classes with Julie, but each grade shares the same lunch period. She introduced herself during a Freshman lunch break about three weeks into the school year, and we seemed to hit it off, friendship wise at least. Whether or not anything could of or would have developed beyond that will forever remain unanswered questions.&quot;<br />
&quot;Because about that time is when the rogue werevixen Yvette Smith killed your father,&quot; realized Cassie, sitting up now.<br />
&quot;Yeah. She swears it was an accident. All she wanted was to take <i>her fox</i> and go run off into the woods somewhere to spend the rest of their lives together. But when Yvette turned my father, the life/mate bond she was hoping would form between them actually linked my parents in ways no one could have foreseen, especially considering part of the reason we moved to Moon Lake to begin with was to get a fresh start and hopefully overcome some of the... problems they were having.&quot;<br />
Cassie saw a tear trying to escape Eric&#39;s eye, so she held open her arms, but Eric shook her off. &quot;I appreciate the offer, but I have to finish this. Dad died defending his house and the ones he loved from her. But losing him took a traumatic toll on all of us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; said Cassie. &quot;Even after all this time, mom still isn&#39;t quite right in some respects without my dad around.&quot;<br />
&quot;The funeral, Yvette&#39;s trial, therapy, grief counseling, trying to move on past all that. I never meant to, but even if there was anything there to begin with, I just lost interest in Julie; especially since she couldn&#39;t understand why I wanted to become a police officer, let alone a werewolf. I sincerely hope she gets better. A part of me will always care for her, and hopes that someday we might be friends again. I don&#39;t know how or why she thinks I should be a were-merman, let alone that I&#39;m <i>hers</i>. The fact that she now doesn&#39;t see me as is and demands to know where the aquatic Eric is doesn&#39;t sound good. But as far as life, let alone any possibility of love is concerned, I&#39;ve moved on,&quot; admitted Eric, while taking Cassie&#39;s paw in his.<br />
&quot;Eric, just so there are no secrets between us. You obviously know I&#39;m not a virgin,&quot; began Cassie, moving her free hand to hold paws with him. &quot;There were other guys, including Ben Twist for awhile. But it was just recreational were sex. Yet with you, it&#39;s different. Being with you actually MEANS something. Saying &#39;I love you&#39; actually means something to me now. When I said that sentence to you, that was the first time I ever said them to anyone I wasn&#39;t already related to somehow. I DO love you Eric Anderson. Whether it&#39;s because of what my mom said about a bond forming between us because I&#39;m the one who turned you, or because Ben was a more successful matchmaker than he realized, I love YOU Eric!&quot; repeated Cassie, before kissing him.<br />
<br />
Eric wrapped his arms around Cassie and eagerly returned the kiss. Which lead to another kiss.<br />
And another. And another...<br />
When they finally stopped to breathe again, Eric looked at Cassie, and with all the sincerity in his lupine voice he could muster said, &quot;Since it&#39;s part of your mom&#39;s conditions, you know I can&#39;t <i>officially</i> ask you this until after we graduate high school, but when the time DOES come, how would you feel about being married to a police officer?&quot;<br />
Cassie smiled at him as she began to cry tears of joy. &quot;Well, you will become a cop before I can complete medical school and am licensed to practice in Washington state, let alone in Moon Lake. So if you don&#39;t mind waiting until after that before mom&#39;s conditions would allow us to have children...&quot;<br />
Eric started wiping the tears off Cassie&#39;s muzzle as he said, &quot;As long as I can still be with you, does it matter when?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just as long as you&#39;re right here,&quot; replied Cassie, wrapping her arms around him and pulling Eric closer.<br />
<br />
Their fur meshed against each other as their muzzles locked into another round of passionate kissing.<br />
Eric laid Cassie down on her back and started moving his now erect and quite eager lupine penis towards her again when Cassie politely said &quot;No. If I&#39;m going to be your she-wolf and you&#39;re my future, then you need to claim me <i>properly</i>.&quot;<br />
With that, she turned around and got on all fours while raising her tail high into the air. &quot;Mount me my dashing wolf. Claim your mate and let&#39;s howl to the world that we belong to each other forever!&quot;<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; growled Eric as he rose up and drove his red rocket deep into his she-wolf, grabbing her waist with his front paws while using his back legs to increase the force of each thrust deeper into Cassie.<br />
&quot;Oh yes my Eric. YES!&quot; she screamed, howling in pleasure.<br />
&quot;Oh... C-Cassie!&quot; said Eric with a sensual shudder, before joining her call into the night.<br />
Every werewolf within hearing range of them became aware that there was now a new mated couple amongst the packs of Moon Lake, and not just in the momentarily throes of passion.<br />
Cassie and Eric howled together as their bodies stayed united long after the echoes of their last orgasm faded into history.<br />
Finally, emotionally as well as physically spent for the moment, Cassie O&#39;Sullivan and Eric Anderson laid down where they were, his cock still deep within his lover&#39;s cunt even as they shuddered in the afterglow of their union.<br />
Eric wrapped his arms around Cassie, his dark fur in contrast to her reddish pelt. He moved his head to nuzzle her ears as he said, &quot;I love you Cassie Anderson,&quot; unaware of the unintentional(?) slip.<br />
&quot;I love you my darling Eric,&quot; she replied, taking his paws in hers before moving his hands up so Eric could cup and fondle her breasts.<br />
Then they fell asleep together, happy and in love.<br />

AFTERWARD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES<br />
The Eric Anderson of Earth-3 is closer to the truth than he realized. It was the traumatic shock of his father&#39;s death that broke the bonds that were starting to form between him and the Julie Stovall of this world.<br />
Thus, his eyes never started turning blue as an indication that they were destined soul mates, although the desires of Julie&#39;s heart continued without Eric until they reached the point at the start of the Earth-3 story thread and events progressed to where they are now.</p>
