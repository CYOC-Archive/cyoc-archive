<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary was in awe of the beast of a man who had thundered into the recently recreated office. In short, Coach Eli had transformed into likely the most masculine specimen to walk the Earth, which was saying something considering he had been no slouch in the category of manliness before (of course all thanks to Gary’s chronivac tampering).<br />
<br />
Dressed in pristinely kept athletic shorts, a white polo, and ball cap, Eli stood head and shoulders above the average person, and certainly competed in height with even the tallest of people. This alone would have been intimidating enough, but Eli now sported the body of a god, complete with shredded and perfectly symmetrical muscle on muscle. Every sinew could be seen in near precise clarity through his outfit, from the largest muscle group to the tiniest little fiber. Eli’s sculpted body was a work of anatomical art. Gary couldn’t help but stare slack jawed as he slowly took in the man before him… <br />
<br />
From the massive boats for feet rose football sized calves and diamond cut thighs, which together formed the most spectacularly large set of wheels known to man. And boy did Eli’s wheels go on for days before they finally reached his narrow and shredded waist. Eight flawlessly sculpted abdominals adorned his stomach, which, so full with mass bloated outwards from his core. These abs of the gods only set to accentuate the breadth by which Eli’s barn door back spread outwards behind him, which acted to support his meaty pecs. Tantalizing nipples sat low on Eli’s chest, and wiry hair sprouted up from the muscular cleavage. Even with all this masculine beauty, what sort of physique would be complete without mention of arms? Eli’s certainly did not shrink away from the limelight; ham hock forearms hung heavily beneath cannon ball bis, horseshoe tris, and massive cannon shot shoulders.  <br />
<br />
As if his immaculate body wasn’t enough, Eli’s visage was that of virile perfection. Gary couldn’t tell exactly how, but something was different with Eli’s face that just made it more beautiful. Striking. Perfect. An exquisitely maintained beard covered his square jaw, granite cheek bones, and full lips. Heavy brows and a strong nose framed deep, sparkling eyes. Even the coach’s forehead lines, which most people would’ve prefer without, only seemed to accentuate his handsome yet mature attraction. Gary could recall all of these traits from before, and yet something about them was more alluring. It was like everything that made Eli “Eli” had been concentrated and refined. Truly, the coach now exemplified a new standard of masculinity.<br />
<br />
Eli grinned cockily at the lesser man before him. He knew the effect he had on people, and that effect was not lost on the visibly shaking Gary. So weak in the knees was he that even the slightest of additional stimuli would likely floor the poor guy. And Eli knew exactly the stimulus to push Gary over the edge.<br />
<br />
Using both hands, Eli roughly readjusted his manhood through his shorts. Even through his jock could the outline of his bully club of a dick and bloated low hanging nutsack be seen. Despite all his underwear being specially tailored to fit his immense equipment, they always struggled to contain the virile coach’s cock and balls in any modest or dignified manner. Despite all the “problems” this sometimes caused, Eli thought it was a worthy price to pay for being as well-endowed as he was. <br />
<br />
Whatever the case, this lewd gesture was the final straw for Gary, who’s legs gave up the fight with gravity after the last of his blood traveled southward from one head to the other. With a less than manly yelp, Gary collapsed to the ground, moaning and convulsing in the throes of the most spectacular orgasm he had ever experienced. Gary writhed on the ground for several very long seconds before finally succumbing to the overstimulation. With one last groan, his eyes rolled up into his head and he was out like a light.<br />
Eli chuckled to himself. Gary’s little performance had been quite the spectacle, and had caused his own dick to begin to harden. The beast lurched in excitement, and expelled a healthy sized dose of pre which quickly soaked through his jockstrap and into his shorts. For a brief moment, Eli considered whether he had taken things too far. He had just singlehandedly derailed the rational thoughts of another human being, instead replacing them with only carnal desire. All with a simple hoist of his prodigious horse cock.  <br />
<br />
The universe Eli had written for himself with the “silly” chronivac app Gary had sent him was ripe with opportunity. In this reality, he had achieved everything he had ever desired, plus some. By the time he had turned 16, Eli had grown to limits most men couldn’t even biologically achieve by age 30: he was comparable in size to the largest pro bodybuilders, would routinely go from clean shaven to five o’clock shadow before noon, and was packing enough heat to put the average pornstar to shame. And these accelerated traits followed him as he got older, Eli made sure of that in his reprogramming. Eli had continued to grow and mature through his college years, and even beyond into his 30’s. Now that he was 40 (not accounting for Gary’s tampering with his age), Eli was a man of many talents and accolades. Mr. Olympia by 18. AVN male performer of the year by 20. 8 consecutive Super Bowl rings by 29.  Numerous photoshoots, guest appearances, and interviews. An endless number of sexual partners to please him (and for him to please). The list went on and on, Eli finally retiring from the several careers he had taken to train the next generation as the athletic director and head football coach at a university. With his new updated memories playing in his head next to his old ones, Eli reassured himself: he most certainly had not taken things too far.<br />
<br />
Focusing himself back to the present, Eli glanced down at his student and friend who stirred slightly from the heap on the floor. Though he could in no way compare to his overwhelming masculinity, Gary was certainly no slouch of a man. His 300 plus pound frame and youthful good looks were well superior to that of the average male. The coach absentmindedly adjusted himself again with one huge mitt. Eli considered propositioning the young man for some “extracurricular” learning when he finally came to. After all, Eli was very grateful to Gary for sending the chronivac his way. Without it, he’d never have accomplished all he had, and what better way to repay the man than to give him the full Eli experience?<br />
With that thought in mind, Eli pumped another hefty dollop of pre into his pants. Gary groaned, one hand massaging his eyes, the other rubbing at his damp groin.</p>
