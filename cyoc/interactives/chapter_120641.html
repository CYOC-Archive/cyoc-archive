<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the bullies left, another person comes into the locker rooms and opens his locker. Only to find a human standing there as he just stares at him. &quot;Uh... Hi?&quot; Cory says sheepishly. &quot;Hi...&quot; he replies back and continues, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you were in here before right? Care to explain why you are in my locker?&quot; Jaysen then helps Cory out of his locker and sits down at one of the benches as Cory tells his story, though he won&#39;t believe him but tries to. It started with a Chronivac the got and used it on himself to become a doll for thirty minutes, but lasted longer due to the power outage. He was then found by his neighbor and was taken to her house. By the time he became normal, he was no longer a doll and escaped through the window. He then finds out he has the abilities the Chronivac has that protected him, in other words, shapeshifting. Now, he was being chased by bullies and had no choice but to become a shoe and one of the bullies tossed him into the locker, Jaysen&#39;s locker.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; he crosses his arms, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t believe we have met properly!&quot; he then notices. &quot;The name is Jaysen,&quot; he extends his hand to him as he reaches. &quot;Cory. And I think I saw you before, you&#39;re part of that new fencing club that you and your friend made right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. I did. Also, I do believe your story about the Chronivac, I have one at home too. Surprised that you now have the abilities of the Chronivac and shift yourself in anyway you want to.&quot;<br />
Cory looks down at the floor, &quot;Thanks. To be honest, I am scared that I might be abused if you use my new ability, now that I told you.&quot; Jaysen puts a hand on his shoulder, &quot;It&#39;s alright. You&#39;re safe with me. I won&#39;t use your Chronivac for my own needs. However, you might need to hide. I think your bullies might be somewhere near the locker room door and I think it is almost for practice. You might need to change into something else.&quot; He then points to his wrists and asks, &quot;Think you can be a jade bracelet for me for a moment until sports practice ends. I&#39;ll ensure your safety. I promise.&quot; Cory nods and thinks on what he needs to be as his arms and legs starts to touch each other and meld as he arcs his back and smooths away becoming a bracelet that Jaysen specified, as clatters on the bench. Jaysen then picks him up and puts him through his right arm.<br />
Cory- &lt;Hello? Can you hear me?&gt;<br />
Jaysen- &lt;I can hear you. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be okay. I always keep my promise.&gt;<br />
Cory- &lt;Thank you.&gt;<br />
Jaysen- &lt;That&#39;s what friends are for.&gt;<br />
<br />
Finally, some of the different sports players show up, mostly the football and basketball players as Jaysen sets up his fencing equipment. One of the bullies in the football team comes up to him, &quot;Hey, have you seen Cory around?&quot; Jaysen looks at him bemused and lies, &quot;No, I haven&#39;t and if you&#39;re gonna harass me, you&#39;re going to have a bad time buddy.&quot; Several of the football players looked at the bully and lets out oohs and aahs as he bit his lip. Just then, Jaysen&#39;s fencing team shows up backing him as the bully retreated back to his group. &quot;Pff...! Football idiots.&quot; his best friend, Kevin, remarks as another one replies in a small tone for the others in the other team across from them to hear, &quot;Aw don&#39;t worry about it Kev, they have footballs for brains too.&quot; the others chuckle as the other football players look at what they&#39;re giggling at and growls. Jaysen then stops them, &quot;Alright you guys, enough with the chatter and get geared up. Our third match starts in a few days so we need to start practicing!&quot; his team acknowledges and one of them points out to Cory on his arm. &quot;Hey, when did you get that bracelet?&quot; Jaysen looks at Cory on his arm and back to his teammate and other friend, Rojas, that noticed it.<br />
Jaysen- &lt;Don&#39;t worry, I trust them.&gt;<br />
Cory- &lt;Okay..&gt;<br />
&quot;I got this just yesterday and put it in my backpack so I can wear it later.&quot; he says and winks to him in morse code, [Not the right place to talk about it. I&#39;ll explain after practice with Kayne and the others.]  Rojas gets in on the lie and wink to confirm it.<br />
<br />
After practice and putting on their normal clothes after a shower, Jaysen makes sure the other sports team and Cory&#39;s bullies leave the scene as his fencing team finishes changing. With the coasts clear, Jaysen then tells Cory it is safe to revert back to normal. The fencing team then watches his bracelet soon become human as Cory now stands beside Jaysen blushing and embarrassed. &quot;Hi..&quot; Jaysen then summarizes his story to the others as they then get the picture of how he got the bracelet. Rojas then talks, &quot;I see. So he got that ability from the Chronivac from a blackout?&quot; Cory and Jaysen nods. &quot;Right now, he needs us to protect him from the bullies like Charles and the others in the football team. He then draws a line in the sand, &quot;And no one uses his Chronivac abilities for abusive ways, understood?&quot; His fencing team nods in agreement as they walk out of the school going their separate ways. Jaysen and Cory then walks side by side as he asks him a question, &quot;Hey, want to join the fencing team?&quot; Cory looks at him, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;You heard me, I won&#39;t force you, but I feel like you can be a good fencer. And not by your Chronivac abilities.&quot; Cory then thinks about it and asks him, &quot;If I say no, will you still protect me as a friend?&quot; Jaysen nods, &quot;I always do. Even if you don&#39;t accept my invitation to the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
They soon reach Cory&#39;s house. &quot;Well, I do not know, but I will give you my answer tomorrow after school.&quot; Jaysen nods again and they both parted ways. The next day...</p>
