<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sorry, Alpha,&quot; one of the Betas was saying, while the other one choked back a fit of laughter. &quot;He&#39;s just so funny-lookin&#39; like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah!&quot;, the other one finally spat out. &quot;He&#39;s like, half-rabbit, half-wolf... and half-human!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk turned to me, a look on his muzzle that said &quot;This is what I have to put up with all the time.&quot; As taunting as he could still be, I could tell how happy he was to have another transformed human in the pack.<br />
<br />
The four of us had been out hunting all night, returning back to the den only when the first glimmers of dawn started to lift the blackness out of the sky. I&#39;d let my new set of predatory instincts take over, but I was still a beginner and didn&#39;t have much to contribute to the hunt when they weren&#39;t sending the prey straight toward me. I helped, though, with every small animal they decided to corner - thankful in the back of my mind that none of those targets were rabbits - and they always let me take a bite or two of the carcass once they&#39;d caught it.<br />
<br />
With every chunk of flesh I swallowed, I felt the changes progressing a little further, seemingly radiating out from my filled-up gut. Every inch of my body tingled with the cruel reminder of what I&#39;d lost, what I was <i>still</i> losing bit by bit as the magic did its work, what I wanted desperately to stop from happening to me. Sharp claws grew out of my paws, my fluffy white fur darkened into gray, and I got just a bit bigger each time. But the transformation from were-rabbit to werewolf was far from finished, which is why the Betas were trying not to laugh at the awkward mixture between the two that my body had become.<br />
<br />
Sunrise was their cue to go to sleep. I assumed I would have to curl up with them and do the same, but Dirk grabbed me by the tail and pulled me aside. &quot;Now that the pups have gone to bed, Omega,&quot; he said in a quiet but still forceful growl, &quot;it&#39;s time we had some real fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
I knew that his idea of fun was going to be my idea of torture. And I didn&#39;t have to ask what it was, either. My sense of smell, already incredibly heightened by the change into a rabbit, had become exponentially more powerful when my wolf snout grew in. That made it impossible to ignore the overpowering scent of Dirk&#39;s pheromones that wafted off his emerging red rocket, and his whole body, as he pulled me closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been looking forward to this all night,&quot; Dirk snarled as he stuck his thick wet nose into my crotch, his front paws clutching my shoulders so I couldn&#39;t squirm out of his grasp. &quot;It&#39;s been so frustrating, all these full moons, with only a couple other males for company. Finally, I have a bitch I can make my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
A very canine-sounding whimper came out of me involuntarily at those words. My hermaphroditic biology was not one of the parts of my body that had changed during the long hours of hunting. And as much as I was dreading what was about to happen, my vagina wasn&#39;t listening. It trembled with anticipation. My cock, which still looked more rabbit-y than canine, was betraying me, too. It popped out of its sheath in excitement, apparently not realizing that it wouldn&#39;t get to do any penetrating anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Dirk was eager - he wasted no time sticking it in. I heard myself yelp as the huge canine cock started to work its way into me. My features were gradually changing all around from rabbit to wolf, but I hadn&#39;t gotten much bigger in the process yet. It felt like that thing could rip me in half! There was more pain than pleasure in it, and for a moment I completely forgot the submissive role I&#39;d been forced into. &quot;No! Stop!&quot;, I cried out - then clapped a paw to my mouth, knowing I had just made things worse for myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to stop?&quot; Dirk had a menacing smirk on his muzzle. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; He started to pull out, and I felt the tearing pain and exhausting pleasure of his oversized member all over again as it slid back out of my tight opening. I struggled to breathe as the sensation rippled through me, every part of my body desperately wanting this except my brain. &quot;You know, your scent speaks a lot louder than your words, Omega,&quot; he said tauntingly. &quot;You might be awfully small for me, but deep down I can tell that you&#39;re ready for it. You need this. It might help you change a little faster, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next thrust inward came a moment later. This time it was easier to take. Physically, I mean - it was just as torturous mentally as the first one. I felt my innards reshaping themselves around his demanding penis, and that was <i>not</i> a metaphor. The transformation magic must have been helping out along the way, making my internal plumbing compatible with his cock before he could do any real damage in there. I struggled to concentrate as the pain was replaced with mind-blowing goodness that ran deeper and deeper into my guts. But I had a guess at what he was aiming for. He wasn&#39;t just fucking my brains out, he was carving a path to the very core of my new being, the spot where the Easter eggs were supposed to come from. He was going to hollow me out and fill me with his seed, as deep as it would go.<br />
<br />
If I&#39;d been in my right mind, I would have been pulling myself across the forest floor on my paws, trying to get away, get him out of me, before he could finish. But there was no way to escape. His huge, muscle-bound body was firmly laid on top of mine, the fur on his pectoral muscles pressing against the back of my head, rubbing against the ears that were no longer as long and floppy as they&#39;d been an hour ago. His front paws started to grab at my face, feeling my expressions of agony and ecstasy like a blind man reading Braille. An irresistible urge ran through me and escaped from my mouth as a high-pitched moaning - no, I realized, I was howling. And so was he, about an octave lower.<br />
<br />
All the while, his full weight crushed me against the ground and pressed me down until I could taste the dirt. I&#39;m sure he would have popped me like a grape if I hadn&#39;t been gradually getting bigger with every pump of his big red cock. But I was still no match for the size of him.<br />
<br />
Then a thundering roar came from him that shook me as I lay underneath. I could feel the sheer force of his orgasm as he painted my new, much larger vagina with white. He didn&#39;t wait for me to cum, of course. He didn&#39;t care if I was enjoying myself or not. My own penis was still crushed between my stomach and the ground, throbbing with every rough motion I was subjected to, but not getting much stimulation of its own. It hadn&#39;t grown along with the rest of me, either. As the heavy, growling breaths above me started to slow down and relax, I felt my cock give out a pathetic little dribble, then start to shrink back into my body all dissatisfied.<br />
<br />
I thought maybe now I could try to get away, but after the slightest struggle, I felt that he was still lodged firmly inside of me. &quot;Sorry, Omega,&quot; Dirk said, still panting. &quot;I&#39;ve got my knot in you. Guarantees that my seed will have plenty of time to get all the way inside, and not just drip out the hole as soon as I pull out. Just another thing that sets us wolves apart from the... inferior species.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was trapped, physically, just as much as I was forced into being a part of their wolf pack. The dread hung over me, and yet I felt like I had to break the awkward silence as we remained stuck together, both of our heart rates slowly coming back down. &quot;So, uh... Alpha,&quot; I started, as meekly as possible, &quot;I guess you must have been pretty surprised to find me, of all people, turning into a rabbit, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk responded with a hearty, barking laugh. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Omega. You&#39;ll find out before long that our sense of smell is just as strong when we&#39;re back in our human shapes. I knew exactly what was happening to you the moment you scurried into the office on Monday morning. You absolutely <i>reeked</i> of rabbit cum, and I could tell it was yours. And judging by the fear signals you were giving off, I knew it had to be your first time. That&#39;s when I decided to put this whole plan into action.&quot;<br />
<br />
I froze. No. Did he mean...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... oh, my... that night when I was explaining the idea to the Betas. I was just about to tell them how I knew one of our targets personally, when I smelled you and your lover hiding in the bushes.&quot; He sat up a bit, feeling me twitch nervously underneath him. &quot;Ha! Don&#39;t tell me you seriously thought I couldn&#39;t detect you at such a close range!&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt him shifting position a little inside of me, as if to scrape the last little bit of pleasure off of my inner walls. &quot;Of course, I couldn&#39;t just attack the two of you then and there,&quot; he continued. &quot;What would be the fun in that? I could tell that you craved the adventure, that somewhere deep down you <i>wanted</i> the chase. You were begging me to track you down somehow. And yes, I could have just looked up your address in the payroll system, but <i>I</i> wanted the thrill of the chase, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughed to himself again. &quot;I have to thank you, by the way, Omega. You set it up perfectly for us. That damned rabbit, he&#39;s always known how to mask his scent whenever he feels threatened. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s something to do with the magic, but whenever we spotted him, we&#39;d always lose the trail as soon as he got out of our sight. And yesterday, when we finally found the right house and saw that little morsel chewing on your dandelions, he was off like a shot into the bushes. I thought for sure we&#39;d lost him again. But then I smelled <i>you</i> all over him, and that led us right to the target! That&#39;s when I knew it had to be deliberate. You marked him just for us. You made sure there was no way for him to hide.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Dirk&#39;s penis slowly deflated and popped back out of me, I was left totally numb. My brief moment of absolute bliss with E.B., and the long, passionate kiss that had sealed our love, was the very thing that had betrayed him. And even worse than that, I had completely failed at the one thing a were-rabbit was supposed to be perfectly skilled at - cleverness in the face of danger. At every turn, Dirk had outsmarted both of us. Before I even knew any of this magical stuff existed, he was already several steps ahead. Maybe it was for the best that I&#39;d ended up this way...<br />
<br />
I must have passed out not long after that, sleeping through most of the daylight hours and only waking up as darkness started to fall again. And when I came to, I saw that there wasn&#39;t much rabbit left on my body. The dark gray fur had all but taken over, with only a few patches of white left.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve truly become a member of the pack now,&quot; Dirk explained when he saw me looking myself over. &quot;All the way down in your soul, you&#39;ve accepted the changes that the magic has thrown at you, without an ounce of resistance from that whimpering little bunny part of you. And I&#39;m proud to say that the Betas and I can finally put our full trust in you, as a loyal werewolf to the cause. You&#39;ll get to join us when we get rid of that stupid rabbit once and for all! And I&#39;m sure that when we kill that bunny, the surge of transformative magic will wipe off those last few bits of white fuzz on you, too. But we&#39;ve only got a few hours left until Easter Sunday begins. Which means it&#39;s finally time for us to bring you to our ritual grounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
My head hung low as the other three wolves, all of them still much larger than me even though I had grown quite a bit, marched in formation around me. This was it, I thought, the last humiliation before my fate is sealed. And yet, at the same time, something in my brain was beckoning to me, telling me it wouldn&#39;t be so bad if I just gave in and embraced what I was offered. A powerful new form, vicious and strong - an apex predator in these majestic woods. A sense of camaraderie with my three new friends, who I could learn to love just as quickly as I&#39;d loved that rabbit. The wolf inside me - not the one who&#39;d literally been inside me earlier, the one that had penetrated my <i>mind</i> - promised all of these things and more. A full stomach. A full vagina. A full heart. And I just didn&#39;t have the strength to say no to it anymore.<br />
<br />
The wolves all suddenly stopped in their tracks. I looked up from my changing front paws. And there was the sight I&#39;d been dreading all along, the sight that I was still entirely unprepared to see in front of me. E.B. was tied tightly against the trunk of a tree, his arms forcibly stretched out from his sides, every part of him entangled in the ropes. I could see all over him the marks of torture - he&#39;d been scraped and cut and bitten in so many places that the spots of blood had stained half of his white fur with red, while other clumps of it had fallen away to reveal the bare, bruised skin underneath. His muzzle was curled up in agony, his eyes shut tight, his ears halfway torn off. The outline of his ribcage poked out through the fur of his chest, showing clearly that he&#39;d had nothing to eat in days.<br />
<br />
I thought he must be dead already. But at the sound of our approach, he weakly started to move his head and slowly opened his eyes. And then he saw me, recognizing me in an instant even though my appearance had dramatically changed. And the look of despair, of utter betrayal, on his mangled, bloody face when he realized what I had done... It created a feeling in me that I&#39;d never felt before.<br />
<br />
The feeling was...</p>
