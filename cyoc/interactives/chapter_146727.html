<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tilting their heads and nodding in agreement, Kairos and Orveus strafe in opposite directions until both surround Kenos from both sides. The tome the reptilian mage holds begins to shake, before it&#39;s pages fly open in his scaled hands.<br />
<br />
Rearing his claws back, Orveus roars in glee as he lunges for the mage&#39;s throat. His deadly claws freeze mere inches from the magic wielder&#39;s robed form before they can even touch him.<br />
<br />
Lifting the werewolf with his magic, the lizardman grunts with effort as he turns to Kairos and tosses the lupine at him. Narrowly sidestepping his friend&#39;s large form, the impact of the werewolf&#39;s muscular body causes the entire grove to tremble.<br />
<br />
The grey scaled reptilian frowns as Kairos charges for him. Before he can attempt to freeze the human&#39;s weapon, stars fill his vision, a loud ringing filling his ears as his muzzle met the front of the iron shield. Recoiling from the blow, tranquil rage fills Kenos’ eyes as blood trickles from his nostrils. <br />
<br />
The tome flies from his grasp and floats above him, it&#39;s seemingly endless pages flipping in an almost hypnotic motion. His eyes shut his hands rise to his forehead, the lizardman&#39;s middle and index fingers forming into a diamond-like shape.<br />
<br />
“<i>Unleash your third eye.</i>” An orb of purple light forms from within the diamond, bearing resemblance to a pupil. Seeing it as an opportunity to attack, Kairos thrusts his blade forward.<br />
<br />
Holding Kairos’ sword in place, the blade lies mere inches from impaling the tome wielder&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
Yet the human notices that only <i>the sword</i> itself had been frozen, the effect transferring to his arm. Releasing his grip from it&#39;s handle, the red clothed warrior rolls behind the mage, gets to his feet, and drives the edge of his shield into the grey reptile&#39;s ribs.<br />
<br />
The floating blade clatters against the ground at the shield&#39;s impact. Pushing Kairos away with a burst of energy, the lizard mage&#39;s knees buckle from the blow. Clutching his side in pain, the sight of blood dripping from his maw snaps him out of the daze before he regains enough composure to narrowly avoid another swing from the swordsman.<br />
<br />
A muffled hiss slips from the lizard&#39;s maw as he faceplants to the ground, the tome slipping from his grip and falling beside him. The sound of tearing cloth echoed throughout the silence of the night.<br />
<br />
Quickly hopping to his feet, Kenos’ eyes widen in horror as his torn robe slides down to his clawed feet, leaving him in an embarrassingly loose loincloth. However, that was the least of his problems.<br />
<br />
Countless diamond shaped runes were etched into the lizard&#39;s bare scales, their black color easily made out among the grey. Such a contrasting color seemed to imply his scales had been cut or even burned to have formed such markings. Despite this, the sight paled in comparison to the lizardman&#39;s horrifically malnourished form, his body thin and frail, as if his natural growth had been stunted. The moonlight reflecting off his grey scales gave him a horrifying resemblance to a skeleton.<br />
<br />
Both Kairos and Orveus’ eyes stare in horror. Kenos immediately retrieves his tome, holding it close with one hand while the other hand lay outstretched. Overcome by pity, the werewolf&#39;s guard falters.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re truly nothing more than a child. That tome, those runes, they <i>reek</i> of death.” The reptile&#39;s posture remains still despite his body being exposed to the frigid night air. Shaking his head, he spits at the duo.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t need your pity. I chose this path long ago, nothing will change that.” Glaring into each other&#39;s eyes, Orveus sighs as he spots a tinge of regret from within the lizard.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t want to do this, do you? You never did. Whoever did this to you, we can--”<br />
<br />
A scream of rage causes both warriors to flinch, a horrid mix of both pain and anger coming from the lizardman&#39;s jaws. Clasping his head, the hand with his tome stretches out, the pages flipping wildly. The runes on his body glow a deep lavender, the light shining from them illuminating the grove. Kenos’ slit eyes flash a dark purple as a large ball of energy forms atop the tome, the magic orb <i>crackling</i> with death.<br />
<br />
The differing shades of purple hypnotize Kairos, breaking out of the trance as Orveus lightly nudges him with an elbow. Bringing his muzzle to the human&#39;s ear, the swordsman&#39;s blue eyes widen.<br />
<br />
Pulling his head back, a nod from his companion reassures Kairos. The pair glance back at the grey lizardman, the orb continuing to grow. Whispering a silent prayer, Kairos brandishes his sword as Orveus charges forward. <br />
<br />
“<i>No matter how distorted it is</i>,”<br />
<br />
With every step, Orveus gets closer to the mage. The small reptile&#39;s voice echoed inside his mind, it&#39;s tone broken.<br />
<br />
“<i>No matter how putrid it is</i>,”<br />
<br />
Hiding behind a few trees, Kairos grins as Kenos’ attention fully lay on the charging beast before him. Strafing, his unsuspecting target lay mere yards away.<br />
<br />
“<i>No matter how stagnated it is</i>,”<br />
<br />
Thick beads of sweat drip down the lizard&#39;s brow, his breath quickening as the large canine closed the distance between them. Victory smiles upon him as the incantation finishes.<br />
<br />
“<i>This happiness will never falter</i>.”<br />
<br />
A howl from Orveus chills Kairos to the bone, the entire grove illuminating as the magic crashes directly into the wolfman&#39;s barrelled chest. Crashing into the far end of the grove, his body goes limp. <br />
<br />
The following silence is drowned out by a scream from Kenos, his reptilian eyes wide in shock, in <i>fear</i>.<br />
<br />
Glancing to his stomach, his breaths grow short and quick. The bloodied tip of a blade poked out from his stomach, the deep crimson liquid trickling from it&#39;s edge and down his lower abdomen. <br />
<br />
Hyperventilating, the tome slips from Kenos’ grasp, landing perfectly on it&#39;s binding before falling to its back, the eye symbol emphasized by the light of the moon.<br />
<br />
The runes on Kenos&#39; body return to their blackened color as the glow from his eyes fade. A single tear dripping from his left eye. Retching up blood, the lizard falls to his face as Kairos withdraws his blade from the mage&#39;s stomach. <br />
<br />
Unable to bear the sight of Kenos in his dying moments, Kairos averts his gaze to Orveus, the recovering werewolf giving a thumbs up and a solemn grin.<br />
<br />
Walking over to his companion to check for wounds, Kairos tenses up as an odd feeling washes over him. His face twists in puzzlement at Orveus’ look of horror. Spinning around, the expression spreads across his own face.<br />
<br />
Kenos&#39; stood, one hand futilely clutching his stab wound while the other was in front of his face, a pained look in his eyes as a deep blue energy formed within his hand.<br />
<br />
“<i>Serpent&#39;s Kiss</i>.”<br />
<br />
Time was a blur as Kairos suddenly lay on his rump, eyes wide and mouth agape as his eyes were graced by the sight of Orveus’ abdomen being impaled by a beam of blue energy. No howl of pain escaped his maw as he was flung back towards the spot his human companion lay.<br />
<br />
Narrowly diving out of the way of the werewolf&#39;s huge body, Kairos glares at Kenos one last time. The lizardman&#39;s purple eyes grow dull, his mouth forming into a slight smile before his limp body crumples to the ground.<br />
<br />
Rasping, the blonde haired swordsman jumps to his feet, falling to his knees as he stumbles to Orveus’ side. Placing his ear on the wolfman&#39;s chest, Kairos sighs as he sees his stomach rise and fall and the sound of a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
The warmth of the wolfman&#39;s furred and muscular chest against his face felt oddly... <i>comforting</i>. A gasp slips from the human&#39;s mouth as a clawed hand pats the back of his head, claws playing with his hair curtains. <br />
<br />
Stumbling back in embarrassment, Orveus chuckles at the human&#39;s red face and flood of curses. However, his laughter died as quickly as it came, his gaze having fallen to the limp body of Kenos. <br />
<br />
Silence fell across the grove.<br />
<br />
“It’s almost as if he craved death. He would&#39;ve survived the blade wound had he not channelled his life force.” Kairos’ head tilts at his friend&#39;s statement, before his expression shifts into worry.<br />
<br />
“Orveus, do you feel alright? You&#39;ve taken two different magic spells, and both looked incredibly potent, especially if he was powering the last with his life force.” Orveus gives a sly grin. <br />
<br />
“You worry too much, Kairos. Werewolves are much more resistant than humans against magic. Still sure you don&#39;t want me to-- Guh!”<br />
<br />
Kairos rushes to the werewolf&#39;s side once again as he clutches his stomach. A loud gurgle resounds from it, accompanied by a loud belch from the wolfman&#39;s muzzle. Patting his gut, Orveus gives a hearty chortle. “I guess I&#39;m just very hungry!”<br />
<br />
Rolling his eyes, Kairos steps back in annoyance. “Orveus, you <i>better</i> not be playing around at a time like this. If you were starving to death you wouldn&#39;t be burping up a storm.” Orveus opens his mouth to retort, yet all that comes out is another burp.<br />
<br />
Sweat drips down Kairos’ brow as the werewolf&#39;s large stomach vibrates, the volume of the gurgles increasing with his friend&#39;s belching. The red clothed human shouts as the canine&#39;s belly begins to expand with every belch, inflating like a balloon.<br />
<br />
Orveus was unable to utter a word, the only sound coming from his mouth being a spine chilling mix of gurgles and belches. <br />
<br />
Kairos’ eyes snap shut as Orveus stomach stretches to it&#39;s limit, the sound of tearing flesh echoing throughout the woods.<br />
<br />
“<b><i>ORVEUS</i></b>!” Kairos cries, raising his shield to shield his vision as a loud, wet popping noise drowns out a final agonized howl from the werewolf.<br />
<br />
Flung back, the human&#39;s head crashes against a tree trunk. Blankly staring into the sky, drops of blood rain from the sky, dousing him in the remains of Orveus.<br />
<br />
Unable to comprehend, Kairos’ mind recedes into unconsciousness, the howling echoing throughout his mind.</p>
