<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide to mess with Emily&#39;s drawer some more. You had enjoyed the sex, but you wanted to see if you could push her more.<br />
<br />
You opened up her priorities. Just as expected, her physiological needs were at the front. You didn&#39;t really want to mess with those... Sex drive was in there. You wondered what it would be like if she valued sex more than food. Or warmth. If anything, she&#39;d just seek it out. Maybe even become a prostitute just so she can get as much sex as possible. You shuddered at the power this represented. Inside her sex drive was a desire to dominate, a desire to orgasm, a desire to give pleasure. You cheekily take out her desire to orgasm, wondering what effect that could have. Then you quickly shut this folder, wary of what kind of damage it could cause.<br />
<br />
Next up was &quot;safety needs&quot;. You looked through, her need for financial security was pretty high. Apparently the experience of being unemployed for as long as she has has kicked it up the chain. You mom is in there, she values being near her and trusts her. Your even in there, apparently she feels safer with you and values having you around if she&#39;s scared or worried. That kind of shocked you, but you were a big guy... you decide to put yourself above her need for financial security, curious what the effect would be.<br />
<br />
Next up was her love and belonging needs. Her friend Jackie was up top, no surprise, her old school was high up, your mom was there. You apparently factored below her old work friends but above her recreational basketball team. Maddy made it above you. That kind of stung. You figured you would have been at least next to Mom, considering how much you hung out. Feeling scorned, you move yourself up to the very top.<br />
<br />
There was also &quot;Esteem Needs&quot;. You open it. Your sister apparently desired self-dignity and independence above all else. They were well above her desire to be accepted by her peer group. That made sense considering her tomboyish and independent spirit. You were way at the back. Apparently she didn&#39;t value respect from you particularly highly. Still feeling stung by earlier, you stick her need to have your respect above her self-dignity.<br />
<br />
There was also &quot;self-actualization needs&quot;. You peeped through but decided against changing anything. These were some pretty heady goals... &quot;be the star player in my team&quot; &quot;play in the WNBA&quot; &quot;have a family&quot; and so on. You didn&#39;t want to change these around.<br />
<br />
You closed the drawer and then laid back in bed.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long before you heard a knock on your door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can I come in?&quot; A quiet voice asked.<br />
<br />
It was Emily. You weren&#39;t actually expecting her until at least tomorrow. It was pretty late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot; You say meekly under your comfy covers.<br />
<br />
Emily walked in with some trepidation. You could see her hand reach for your light, but she withdrew it. Concerned with how you might react to the light suddenly coming on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you asleep?&quot; She asked, &quot;Did I wake you up, bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, it&#39;s alright.&quot; You said sitting up and yawning. You put your bedside lamp on.<br />
<br />
Emily looked a little scared and wild-eyed. She was wearing a nighty and some boyish pajama shorts. Her hair was messed up, but in a loose bun. She overall looked cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure... I just want to be close with you.&quot; She said, &quot;You didn&#39;t freak out when I gave you a blowjob right? You still like me, right? You aren&#39;t like other guys... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Apparently you had made your big sister a bit of a nervous wreck with your modifications. Now she needed your respect, she felt safest around you, and she felt most loved and respected by you. This was a bit concerning, you didn&#39;t intend to make her feel scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, it was really nice actually.&quot; You said, &quot;Do you need a hug or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.<br />
<br />
You got up and hugged her. She melted in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I love you, right?&quot; She asked, &quot;I feel like we don&#39;t say it enough. I used to say I love you when we were kids...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, I guess we just didn&#39;t need to say it anymore.&quot; You answer, &quot;But if you&#39;d like to hear it I love you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat on her bed. Clearly whatever tension or worry had completely gone from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you mind if I sleep in your room tonight?&quot; She asked, suddenly, &quot;I&#39;ll sleep on the floor if it&#39;s too weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, you already sucked my dick we can share a bed if you need to.&quot; You said.<br />
<br />
She nodded and laid down. You sat down next to her, you decided to spoon her. You turn off the light.<br />
<br />
The feeling of your sister&#39;s pert ass against your dick caused it to engorge. She started to grind against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, does my little bro need some more?&quot; She asked giggling.<br />
<br />
You gulped, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll never turn one of your blowjobs down.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed and you quickly pulled down your pants. She immediately went to work on you, not even taking off her own clothes. Your modification to her sex drive made it so that she no longer derived sexual gratification from orgasming, only through domination or through giving others pleasure.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t as masterful as before, but she was clearly FAR more into it. She worked her tongue around your head. She cupped your balls gently. She looked up at you and grinned.<br />
<br />
You were soon spent again. She eagerly swallowed every drop, once more. This apparently made her quiver herself, and she lay back next to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me know if you need another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure thing.&quot; You answer.<br />
<br />
She fell asleep quickly, leaving you awake.</p>
