<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stare at Agatha for awhile in silent frustration as you mull the offer over.  It doesn&#39;t seem fair, but, really, what choice do you have?  Risks to others aside, the embarrassment alone of being seen as you are would be too much for you to leave.  Maybe if you play your cards right, she&#39;ll reward you for helping her, and this whole thing won&#39;t end up being as permanent as she&#39;s implied.  The more you think about it, the more it appears to be the right decision.  The other woman seems to have come to a similar conclusion, as she answers just before you,<br />
<br />
“Fine, witch, I&#39;ll take your offer,” she says with a hint of defiance.<br />
<br />
“I will as well,” you add.  “What do we need to do?”<br />
<br />
Agatha smiles and seems to let out a breath that she didn&#39;t realize she was holding before catching herself, regaining her formal air and answering, <br />
<br />
“This part is simple.  Each of you just need to take my hand.”  She gets up and walks over to stand between the two of you, offering a hand to each.  You take it hesitantly, holding in one hand and placing the other on top.  She seems satisfied with this, so you wait for further instruction.  To your right, you see the woman struggling to hold the hand between two hooves, but once she&#39;s seemed to manage, Agatha continues.<br />
<br />
“Do you offer yourselves to me, mind, body, and soul?  Do you pledge yourselves freely to my service and will, so long as I will have you?”<br />
<br />
The answer pops into your head like a forgotten memory, as if you knew the words on instinct.  The two of you answer in unison, “My mind is yours, my body is yours, my soul is yours.  I offer myself humbly and fully.  May my will be bound to yours.”<br />
<br />
With a tone of finality, Agatha concludes, “Then this contract is accepted.  I take you now into my servitude.  Your past life is behind you, and I accept is as an offering.  You are recreated, my favored servants.”<br />
<br />
With these final words you feel a jolt run through you.  You become dizzy and almost black out, slumping in your chair.  All thought escapes you, and you&#39;re briefly locked in a trance.  Almost as soon as it came, it&#39;s gone again, and you jolt back up in your seat, your head swimming as you struggle to collect your thoughts.<br />
<br />
Agatha beams at the pair of you and claps her hand together at her chest.  “And that&#39;s it!  Not too bad, I hope.  Of course, now that you&#39;re in my service, I suppose we should get to know each other a bit.  Let&#39;s start with your names.”  She waits for an answer.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m-” you start before cutting off in confusion.  “My name is...”<br />
<br />
Blank.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t remember.  Your first and last names are both just... <i>gone</i>.  In fact, as you rack your brain, you can&#39;t seem to recall any specific things about yourself.  Your hometown, your family, your school, your job.  You have faint memories, but they all haze together with no details at all.  You can remember coming here on a walk from home, but not from where specifically.  You look over at your co-servant and see her eyes wide in alarm, her mouth moving silently as she seems to go through the same crisis.<br />
<br />
“I apologize, that may have been a bit cruel,” Agatha interrupts.  “I just wanted to make you aware of some of the mental changes.  I need you both to understand how all of this will work.  Consider it introductory training.  Don&#39;t worry, you will receive names in time.  For now, Boy and Girl will suffice.  Now, if you would, <i>stand up</i>.”<br />
<br />
The the last words echo strangely loudly in your head, and the two of you bolt up immediately.<br />
<br />
“That was a command phrase.  I don&#39;t enjoy using them, and I expect not to need them often, but be aware that they are at my disposal and that I will not be happy if they&#39;re required unduly.  Now, I have enough dealings with animals through my drones, and I&#39;ve always thought pets belong outside, so I suppose a few changes are in order.  Luckily even with mediums, one&#39;s own thralls are very easy to magically alter.  Let&#39;s start with you,”  She says, turning to face you.<br />
<br />
Agatha stands a few feet in front of you.  She taps a finger on her chin as she considers you for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Well, I suppose we don&#39;t have to do anything too crazy yet.  Let&#39;s just get rid of these beastly bits first,” she says, stretching her hands forward in preparation.  She places her palms together, one in front and one behind, then slowly begins to separate them.  As she does, you feel a faint pulling sensation on your trunk and ears.  Soon, your trunk is completely extended straight out from your face and your ears are flat back against your head.  With no more room for them to go, you feel like your head is being pulled in two different directions.  However, Agatha&#39;s hands don&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
Instead, she seems to begin spreading them with more gusto, a glint showing in her eye as she smirks.  The tugs get more intense, and you feel the rubber of your facial features begin to stretch.  Agatha&#39;s hands close into fists, and she seems to strain to pull them further apart.  Your rubbery head feels distorted by the pull and you can&#39;t keep your eyes open with the intensity of the sensation.  Just when it feels like you can&#39;t take anymore, you hear 3 loud pops that reverberate throughout your head.<br />
<br />
As the forces release you, you manage to stay up right, slouching over and panting heavily as you try to regain your composure.  Your breathing feels a bit funny, but you can&#39;t quite place why.  You open your eyes to look back at Agatha to find a very familiar trunk and two over-sized ears floating in the air beside her.<br />
<br />
“There, aren&#39;t you glad to be rid of these?”  Agatha asks  with a smile, her voice sounding a bit muffled even though you&#39;re just a few feet apart.   “I bet they&#39;re a weight off your shoulders.  Well, I don&#39;t really have a use for them either, so...”  She flicks her hands again and the parts are suddenly gone.<br />
<br />
You cross your eyes to confirm your expectations as you find nothing there.  No trunk, no nose, just the very edge of your upper cheeks.  You move a hand up to the side of your head to find smooth, latex skin in the space your ears should occupy.  You move it around to the front of your face to feel the skin in the now flat area in the middle.  It feels similar to your upper cheeks, like they just continue together.  You run a finger up to the point in between your eyes, weirded out by the sensation.<br />
<br />
Agatha chuckles at your examinations.  “You know, for a moment I thought about finishing the job and just taking everything up there, but I still need to give the two of you a tour of the grounds, and I don&#39;t think that would help.  We&#39;ll have to table that one for later.”<br />
<br />
She turns to face the woman.  “Now, what to do with you?”  The woman is visibly apprehensive as Agatha considers her, but she manages to hold herself together.<br />
<br />
“Obviously I can&#39;t just take those hooves away without having to wait on you to crawl everywhere.  I guess I&#39;ll just have to give you normal human parts again.”<br />
<br />
The woman lets out a sigh of relief as Agatha waves her hands for another spell.  The woman&#39;s hooves and ears immediately start changing color to match the rest of her skin.  The hooves at the ends of her legs begin changing first, slowly shifting and elongating, the ends separating into five distinct toes followed by finer details as their form settles into a normal pair of human female feet, albeit with a latex sheen.  The hooves on her arms begin changing next, stretching and flattening out into thick palms.  Then continuing to elongate.  You realize that the change is no different than what you just saw as they begin to shift into the same shape, toes separating and so on until she has a matching pair of feet where her hands should be.<br />
<br />
The woman looks down in shock as she turns the soles up to examine them, then back up at Agatha.  Agatha giggles at the reaction, her demeanor completely different than the cool elegance she&#39;s put on up to this point. <br />
<br />
“What?  I said I would change them back to human parts, and I did!  Donkey feet back into totally normal human feet!  Well aside from the latex, but you&#39;ll just have to get used to that while you&#39;re here.  Now, when I was younger, there was a girl in my class at the academy that always had her servants&#39; bodies altered to the current fashions, and I was so jealous.  I know just what to do with the ears!”<br />
<br />
She waves her hands again and the woman&#39;s ears begin changing in kind.  Their shape changes to take on more human features, but the length only reduces slightly.  In much quicker fashion than her feet, the woman soon has a very long pair of elven-looking ears sticking out from the sides of her head.  Agatha lowers her arms, examining her work with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Cute! I always wanted – er, um...”  Agatha catches herself with a blush, clearing her throat as she looks down to fidgeting with her dress for a moment.  When she raises her head, she has the same cool expression and raised posture that she first greeted you with.<br />
<br />
“Well.  Now that that&#39;s taken care of.  I&#39;ll show you around and explain some of what I&#39;ll have you be doing for me.  Please follow.” <br />
<br />
You and the other woman give each other a look of confusion at the strange shift in demeanor.  The look quickly turned into ogling each others new changes and awkwardly turning away in embarrassment.  You both quickly follow Agatha&#39;s lead in silence.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Agatha&#39;s tour is brief and informative, going over a few rules and showing all the basic necessities.  She instructs you on how to use some of the magical parts of the house, like the kitchen and cupboards, and a closet that would provide toiletries or cleaning supplies according to your needs, though the house keeps itself more or less clean.  She goes over which rooms she plans to convert into work spaces once some preparations have been made.  She implies that you would be a part of those preparations, but doesn&#39;t go into detail.  <br />
<br />
Finally, she shows the two of you to your rooms in the servants&#39; quarters.  Each room is small but has a bed, small closet, and half-bath.  They aren&#39;t as ornately decorated as the rest of the estate, but it&#39;s still a bit nicer than you expected. <br />
<br />
After instructing which room is whose, Agatha turns to the two of you with a sigh.  “Well, I think that&#39;s enough for now.  I&#39;ll have more instruction for the two of you once I have specific tasks, but that can wait until tomorrow.  I know this evening has been full for all of us, and I&#39;m sure you can use some rest.  I have something to work on in my study.  You&#39;re welcome to do as you please, but I will not be disturbed.  Oh, and before I go, <i>once I leave, place all of your personal belongings in the hamper at the end of the hall.  You will forget about them after discarding them.  You can keep your clothes for now.</i>”<br />
<br />
The words reverberate in your head again.  And as she turns to leave, the two of you immediately obey, emptying your pockets of whatever you had.  The woman struggles a bit with her feet, but luckily, she didn&#39;t have much to wrestle out.  After you shut the lid on the hamper, you snap back to your senses, forgetting what you were just doing.  You open the hamper in confusion to find it empty.  With a shake of your head you walk back to the door to your room, the woman following likewise.<br />
<br />
For the first time since you got here, the two of you are alone.  She breaks the silence first.<br />
<br />
“So this is a lot to take in, huh?”  You nod in agreement.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s scary,” she continues, “I can&#39;t seem to remember anything about myself.  I still know, you know... like, what foods I like, or that I like running, but I can&#39;t think of specific places I&#39;ve ran, or even where I had lunch today.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” you agree.  “I have these vague memories, but it&#39;s like trying to remember a dream from years ago.  It&#39;s more impressions than anything.”<br />
<br />
Your voice is surprisingly normal, if a bit stuffy sounding.  You&#39;ve had some time to get used to the muffled quality of all the noise around you and understanding speech is already not too difficult.<br />
<br />
The silence returns again as you both struggle to navigate this situation you&#39;ve been thrust into.  After a few moments...</p>
