<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark waited a bit for Aidan to speak, but when nothing came he sighed and continued with his plan. “Well, now that you are fully encased I want said cloth encasement to merge with your skin, but you will still feel the rough and itchy inside of it. It will encase your nose and open up inside your nostrils. It will also cover the inside of your mouth back to your throat and open up from there. Both will also merge with the skin inside. When the cloth is merged you will grow a tail out of your spine, at least as long as your legs are. And your back will turn to keep you down on all fours, making you a quadruped being. Further your ears will move up your head and become triangular shaped. Beside that your face will push out in a snout on which will grew out whiskers.”<br />
<br />
That brought Aidan back to his senses. “You change me into some kind of cat? What am I, your pet to keep around?” he asked in an angry, but muffled voice. He could feel the cloth growing tighter around him before it merged with his skin, even when he felt it still as a separate thing due to its rough, itchy nature against him. When it pressed itself to the inside of his nostrils he wanted to protest again, but that was all what the cloth needed to enter his mouth, covering each tooth and his tongue until it reached his throat, making the gagging even more intensive. A strong pull on his back brought his new tail in, which grew to a length of nearly one and a half of his legs. With a loud crack and a scream of pain his back bend itself to keep him down on all fours. His ears had been flattened against his head due the cloth, but now reemerged on top of his head, but instead of round they turned triangular. Aidan could see his face pushing outwards, his mouth and nose now merged into a snout, were all of the sudden long whiskers were sprouting out. Aidan was still gagging at the taste of cloth inside his mouth, even after it had merged with everything inside.<br />
<br />
Mark had waited with his responding to Aidans question until this wave of changes had been finished, smiling down at him. “Well yes, I turn you into some kind of cat to keep me company as my pet, but there is also another aspect of what you will be. We should continue I guess. Any cat has paws, so your hands and feet will turn into some now. You will gain sensitive paw pads on the underside and retractable claws on the ends of all four of them. Then in your mouth will grew sharp cat-teeth in-place of your old ones and your nose will reshape into a more fitting one for a cat. Finally out of the soft skin will grew a fluffy fur coat, but to make it a better pattern the black and white will mix a bit more, making it look like a black and white stripped tiger cat.”<br />
<br />
Aidan couldn´t believe what he was hearing. Mark wanted him as a cat pet? Why would he think Aidan would let himself be turned into a pet? He was giving him weapons, so to speak of, when his claws grow out of his newly formed paws. The only problem would be to change himself back, but he would find a way to do so. Through the paw-pads he could already distinguish individual parts of fabric from his carpet. His teeth started to sharpen into pointed cat-teeth, another weapon he could use against Mark. While his nose reformed into a small snout, he could suddenly smell the sock-odor in a new extreme, which let the gag-reflex return full on. Beside the itch he could feel his whole new skin crawling when the fur grew in. When it had finished growing Aidan looked like an ordinary white cat with black stripes all over his body. The only thing out of ordinary was his size, as he was still far to big for a house cat.<br />
<br />
Mark grinned down at Aidan, seeing the fire in his sky blue eyes. He knew Aidan was up to something, most likely a plan to take revenge on him. Good that he had planned beforehand and hadn´t given Aidan his movement back. “Now that you are fully a cat, at least with your body, lets assign your forms. The first form will be what you are right now, a big tiger cat. You will need to gain more muscles, because in that form I want to use you like a mount to get around. Nobody will think that is unusual, in fact to everyone outside its completely normal that I have a tiger cat to ride on.”<br />
Aidan could feel his body swelling with muscles and was happy with them. More strength meant more pain for Mark when he could finally move again.<br />
<br />
Mark then got up and took Aidans discarded jeans and shirt from the floor to throw them over Aidans back after removing his wallet. Next he got Aidans school bag and also dropped it on Aidans back. “I think your old jeans and shirt will make a fine saddle for your mount-form, and your school bag can divide into saddlebags on both sides of it, giving me room to store something on you. This saddlebags will be able to hold more then they look like, even whole furniture, but will only weight about ten kilos at max. And from the back of your collar will grow something similar to reins to hold on. But even when someone pulls on them he won´t strangle you with it.”<br />
Aidan could feel his former clothes turn a bit heavier on his back, the jeans-legs merging under his stomach to keep the new saddle in position. He also felt a small pull on his collar as the reins grew out of it, still connected. He asked irritated to throw Mark off of his plans: “Are you finished yet?”</p>
