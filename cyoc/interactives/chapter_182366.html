<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the dizziness passed, Jeff opened his eyes.  The fact he had eyes at all told him that she was currently not his own penis.  Leaning down and looking between his hind legs legs, sure enough, there&#39;s his sheath.  He coaxed his penis out of his sheath and felt it.  And it felt... normal.  The same doggy dick he&#39;s had his whole life.  But he was certain that within his male sex, was a copy of his conciousness.  Which means, he himself had become the host.<br />
<br />
By all accounts, he should&#39;ve been disappointed.  He had wanted to become his own penis, but from his perspective, he didn&#39;t get to.  And yet, he was okay with this.  Somehow, he found himself no longer interested in being a penis.  It was as though all interest had been drained from him. In fact, he found it strange that he wanted to be a penis in the first place.  All the more strange that he now had someone living as HIS penis, especially a copy of himself!<br />
<br />
Strange or not, the person in his penis did want to be a penis.  He wasn&#39;t sure if his penis was enjoying himself, but either way, it was only temporary.  As soon as his conciousnesses are merged back together, he&#39;ll know whether this was an enjoyable experience or not.  For better or worse.<br />
<br />
For now, though, Jeff returned to the Chronivac&#39;s settings.  If he ever wanted to do another transformation like this one, he wanted to know more about its failsafes.  If he had made himself unaware that his penis was a person, what would happen if he then tried sending another copy of his conciousness to his unknowingly occupied penis?<br />
<br />
Before he could do his research, though, he heard a shout from the young girl of the family.  &quot;Mom&#39;s home!  I&#39;m gonna tell her what you&#39;re doing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff panicked.  Though the Chronivac was legally his, the computer belonged to his owners.  They may treat him like part of the family, but they might be mad if they found out about the Chronivac, especially if they found out he put a copy of his conciousness into his own penis!<br />
<br />
First thing&#39;s first, uninstall the Chronivac!  Upon attempting this, a notice came up: &quot;Failsafe: Chronivac is set to undo transformation(s) after a set time limit.  If Chronivac is uninstalled, it cannot automatically perform this function.&quot;  Not paying attention to the transformation details in between (he already knew what they were, or so he thought), he quickly looked over the three options below: &quot;Undo transformation(s) now&quot;, &quot;Undo transformation(s) manually later&quot;, or &quot;Cancel&quot;.  He wasn&#39;t willing to rob his penis of his experience so quickly, so he chose to undo the transformation manually later.<br />
<br />
Another question popped up: &quot;Do you want to save a backup copy of the transformation log?  This can be used to easily review and alter all transformations up to this point.  Transformations can still be altered manually, regardless.&quot;  Jeff decided he&#39;d better not.  Don&#39;t wanna risk his owners finding that on their computer, either.<br />
<br />
With the Chronivac uninstalled, he unplugged the emitter, and hid both it and the installation disc under his shirt, letting them rest on his lower back, and holding his shirt tight so they didn&#39;t slip out.  He then exited the family&#39;s computer room, trying to hide his tail tucked between his legs.<br />
<br />
He cautiously walked up to the mother, as the young girl of the family finished her snitching.  The mother turned towards him.  &quot;Jeff, what&#39;s this I hear about you messing with our computer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff drooped his ears a little.  &quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am.  I was looking at this thing online.  It&#39;s called the Chronivac.  It supposedly has the power to alter reality to the user&#39;s wishes!  Neat, huh?&quot;  Jeff feined a tail wag.<br />
<br />
The mother gave a skeptical look, before smiling and shaking her head.  &quot;Sounds like science fiction to me.  Just make sure you don&#39;t download anything suspicious to our computer, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mother walked away, towards her bedroom.  The daughter looked at Jeff a moment, before giving a &quot;hmph&quot; and walking off.  Jeff nervously gave a tug at his dog collar.  It felt weird telling a white lie like that, but at least it wasn&#39;t a complete lie.  He&#39;s also glad that nobody questioned why he was holding his shirt the way he did.  A part of him wished he had pants like his owners, but he was definitely glad to at least have a shirt.  Still, he needed to hide the Chronivac emitter and installation disc, and fast.<br />
<br />
Jeff trotted through the kitchen and out the back door.  At the back corner of the yard, between the fence and shed, was a spot of disturbed land.  Using his forepaws to dig through it, he came upon a plastic container.  His owners had given it to him to keep his belongings in.  Pulling the emitter and installation disc with one handpaw, he opened the container&#39;s lid with the other, and placed them inside, along with his bone and his video games.  After closing the lid, he turned and buried the container back underground.  There, that&#39;ll keep the Chronivac safe until he&#39;s able to use it, again.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, tomorrow is Saturday.  That means the daughter is likely to be home all day.  It isn&#39;t safe to use the Chronivac while she&#39;s around.  Jeff will have to wait until Sunday to retrieve his other conciousness from his penis.  Coaxing his penis out once again, he gave it a pat.  &quot;I know you can&#39;t hear me, but you know you can trust me.  I will get you out as soon as I can, I promise.  For now, I hope you like being my penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Letting his penis retract, Jeff started making his way back to the house, stopping to poop along the way.  Though he knew very well the purpose of the owners&#39; toilet, it was too awkward for his lower body to use, so he had settled for sticking with the yard.  He didn&#39;t mind pooping out in the open, and his owners were okay with him doing it, so long as he didn&#39;t poop where they&#39;d step in it.</p>
