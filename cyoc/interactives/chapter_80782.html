<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;On the farm I usually worked with cows.&quot; - Emily started. - &quot;And I always liked them. They always seemed so cute and friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman nodded and Emily continued:<br />
<br />
&quot;And their... Udders...&quot; - Emily's face could effectively be used as a red traffic light now.<br />
<br />
The shop proprietor smiled softly. &quot;Don't be shy, my dear. Every kind of animal has its own beauty. Even aardvarks.&quot; - The woman chuckled and Emily couldn't hep but giggle, imagining an aardvark asking her to &quot;draw it like your French girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman smiled as Emily felt more at ease. Excusing herself, she went to one of the shelves and brought back a big cowbell on a yellow ribbon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Emily, dear, please listen to me very carefully.&quot; - Emily nodded and the woman continued. - &quot;This cowbell will help you transform - physically and mentally. Just imagine the cow form you wish to attain and ring the bell. If you want to change it or revert to human, just ring the bell again. Is it clear?&quot; - Emily nodded again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've put several safety spells on it. First of all, any transformation will last no longer than 24 hours. Second, while you can go in heat (if you wish to) you cannot get pregnant in your cow form. And finally, if the bell is removed, you will immediately revert into your human form. Is it clear Emily?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; - Emily nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; - the woman smiled. - &quot;Now go and have fun with it. Promise?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily smiled and looked the woman straight in the eye. &quot;Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The first day on the farm was mostly orientation and getting familiar with each other. Emily was the only one assigned to cows and she was given the quarters near the barns - perfect! Emily went to see the cows and milked them so that they would start getting used to her.<br />
<br />
Early on the second day Emily went to the barn carrying a small stash. The cows greeted her with loud moos: it was time to milk them and lead them to the pasture. The girl milked them and, ensuring that nobody was around, quickly stripped naked, folded her clothes, put them to the stash and got the cowbell from it. Looking at the cows, Emily put the bell on, imagined her cow form, making sure not to forget the mental part, and rang the bell.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately Emily felt her skin tingling and coarsening, her new fur growing. The pattern was a typical for a Holstein cow, white with black spots. Her human hair disappeared, in their place grew the same coarse white fur, though it was longer, forming a kind of boyish fuzzy haircut on her head.<br />
<br />
Feeling a tingling in her chest, the girl looked down and squealed with joy. Her modest B-cup chest was swelling before her eyes, quickly surpassing cup sizes. Her nipples started to darken and swell, becoming dark pink, thick and long, like a cow's teats. Veins started to show on her breasts as Emily felt them filling with milk. Her breasts changed their form, from round and perky to more drooping, like a cow's udder. Cupping their new mammaries, Emily moaned: having filled with milk, they became very sensitive.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the four nubs on her belly already began to poke out below her navel. Her udder quickly swelled and filled with milk, as it grew even more sensitive than her breasts. Soon it was as large as a cow's udder.<br />
<br />
Deep into pleasure from her breasts and udder, Emily barely noticed her pelvis cracking and getting wider, her ass widening and flattening as her legs spread, accommodating for her new girth. Her spine extended into a long tail with black hairy tuft on top.<br />
<br />
Emily winced and was forced to sit down as her legs shifted and grew longer, her toes fusing and hardening into cloven hooves. She watched in awe as her fingers twitched, her fingers merging, her thumbs thickening, nails darkening, her hands becoming wide three-digited palms.<br />
<br />
The girl moaned as her body ripened - first with muscles, then with fat, her arms, legs and back becoming stronger to accommodate her new body, her thighs as thick as a young tree's trunk, her once trim belly distending with fat, her arms and neck thickening and becoming softer. Her digestive system became more like a cow's, adapting to her new ration.<br />
<br />
Emily felt the changes reaching her face as her ears grew, becoming large, oval and drooping, like a cow's. Her nose darkened and pushed out along with her lower jaw, her face shifting into cow-like muzzle, accommodating her changing teeth as they grew larger and more square - perfect for chewing grass and cud. <br />
<br />
The final change started as Emily's mind began shifting. Her affection to cows grew even stronger, to the point where she considered them her family. As her mind simplified, Emily began to feel at ease about being nude: she was a cow, after all... Emily didn't even notice how she stopped identifying herself as a human and started to think about herself as a cow. Memories of her human life were fading, leaving her only essential things. Despite she still felt dominant to other cows, her mind became more submissive to other humans. Emily felt the need to obey other farmhands and the farm owner. <br />
<br />
As the transformation completed, Emily happily mooed, the cows around her mooed back, greeting her. Remembering her duties, the cow-girl released the cows to the pasture. Before going after them Emily made sure to thoroughly milk herself, as her breasts and udder were filled to the brim. As soon as Emily stepped at green grass of the pasture, she lowered herself on her hands and knees and began grazing herself, her breasts and udder almost brushing the grass.<br />
<br />
Emily was with the cows all day, having a lot of fun. She grazed with them and looked after them at the pasture, straightening them with quick angry moos if needed. In the evening she lead them back into their barns and milked them and herself. No one visited them during the day and Emily was happy about that: despite not having lost the gift of speech completely, this Emily didn't like complex human words. Moos were so much better.<br />
<br />
All cows were milked and Emily let out a sad moo: she had to revert back. She took off the bell and all her cow features just disappeared within a second. Emily rubbed her eyes as her human consciousness returned to her. It was a strange feeling, kinda like awakening. In a hurry Emily put on her clothes and went home, thinking about what could she do tomorrow.</p>
