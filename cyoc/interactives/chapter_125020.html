<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   With Issac now much lighter, the now group of three had mage much more progress than they would&#39;ve done had Issac not left the statues behind. While Issac did feel guilty for leaving the cloud village unprotected against the Cloud Kings men would apparently  be arriving with the next few days to collect taxes, Issac knew he didn&#39;t want to waste any time. What horrors could already be crawling out of the Corruption&#39;s source back on the human world while he spent his time running around a cloud land?<br />
<br />
             The three had traveled about four miles within three days, not wanting to attract any unwanted attention by stopping by any other cloud villages. While they walked, mostly through rolling white fields and large dark gray forests that always rained from inside, Issac got time to learn about three strange biology of this realm. Most of the flora and fauna were alike to ones back on his plane but expected almost entirely made of cloud and mist. Not a single piece of non cloud material was here save for Issac and Issac, and at first they had concerns about food and hunger but were surprised at how filling and tasty the meat of a cloud rabbit Marry had caught was, it was sweet and tasted almost like chocolate in a way though Issac admittedly did not like chocolate all that much. Ilvir seemed to love it.<br />
<br />
        Ilvir. Now that was a concern. The entire journey so far had been fine save for Ilvir who was uncharacteristically quiet. He rarely spoke at all and Issac even using his mental link worth his down could never tell his emotional state. All Issac knew was the looks he gave Marry, not looks of lust or even malice, but looks like Ilvir saw something that was... incomplete. Marry paid no mind, not blinking an eye  when Ilvir masturbated right in front of her, even when he penetrated his asshole with his fingers or an entire fist, Marry would only give a soft smile or continue to converse with them, as if she herself didn&#39;t even register the lewd sexual acts in front of her. <br />
<br />
  Issac had tried to stop Ilvir from doing such uncouth acts in front of their guide and while he promised not to several times by now, Issac was still worried. Atleast he hoped he was worried as they made their way through a particularly large rain forest, water almost constantly dripping all over them as the cloud trees themselves stormed, occasional streaks of lightning radiating across their leaves.<br />
<br />
  The three were taking a short break, sat under the leaves of a raining tree that actually did nothing to keep them from getting wet in retrospect.<br />
<br />
   &quot;So Marry, I thank you for bringing us so far but where now?&quot; Issac said, somewhat irritably as his soaked fur clung to his body.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Well, we have made some progress so far but... I do not mean to be rude but your slow body, even after shrinking is still slowing our journey down quite a bit, if we want to head towards the Cloud Kings&#39;s castle we need to find some what of moving you faster.&quot; Marry explained, chewing onto a chunk of cloud rabbit as she spoke, still wearing her armor save for her helmet which rested by her side, allowing for her light gray hair to billow down to her shoulders, the rain seemingly not affecting it.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Alas, you don&#39;t need to tell me that, I&#39;ve been dealing with this heavy body of mine for a while now, however like I said back when I... ahem, almost tried to stab you, I apologize for that, anyway, whatever I absorb whether it be by using my dagger or directly assimilating it I can take on its properties. Which by that logic means, if I can absorb several creatures from this plane, I might be able to become lighter than before.&quot; Issac explained somewhat awkwardly, not exactly comfortable telling a woman how he planned to lose weight by literally absorbing people into his body.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I see... yes, you did mention that earlier. You say any animal right?&quot; Marry asked.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Yes, this plane&#39;s inhabitants seem to be pretty lightweight, if there is some magical element to their weightless bodies I could probably take advantage of that.&quot; Issac answered. <br />
<br />
      &quot;Yes, making my Master faster would definitely have its uses...&quot; Ilvir chimed in for the first time, drooling at what Issac assumed was his own lustful fantasies.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yes... a bigger, faster Issac.... oh yes...&quot; the stone golem  quietly, moaning, both of his granite cocks hardening, as he starting tugging them impatiently.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Ilvir control yourself now... not in front of Marry.&quot; Issac said.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Is Ilvir alright?&quot; Marry asked with concern, once again showing no reaction to Ilvir&#39;s lustful state.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Marry... I had assumed you know what lust is do you not? Ilvir&#39;S been acting like this for the entire journey so far, don&#39;t you feel the slightest uncomfort at Ilvir?&quot; Issac asked, confused.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Oh is this lust? Interesting, but I currently have no interest.&quot; the cloud woman said, softly smiling. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Currently? I&#39;m sorry can you explain?&quot; Issac asked, eyeing Ilvir from the corner of his vision, watching him jerk off both of his cocks with a lustful fervor, seemingly unaware of anything around him.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Well, it may be hard to explain. After all our bodies being from different planes have obvious differences, not just on the physical, but also the biological as well.&quot; Marry explained.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I see... if you wouldn&#39;t mind, please tell me more.&quot; Issac asked.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Why tell when I can show?&quot; Marry said with a mischievous grin. Standing up she started taking all her armor, every single last piece, taking several minutes as every inch of her body was being revealed to Issac who was now through his fur, stone, and scales was blushing furiously, covering his eyes as to not see. <br />
<br />
  When Marry finished taking off her armor she said &quot;Issac just look already, I really don&#39;t mind.&quot; Marry said. <br />
<br />
     Taking a deep breath and doing his best to control his arousal, Issac uncovered his eyes and looked at the now naked Marry.<br />
<br />
   Marry herself was quite the looker, even more so naked, her cloud white skin matched perfectly with her curves, showing off every inch of her feminine features, every part of her glorious naked body was elegant and beautiful, had she been human, Marry surely would&#39;ve been one of the fairest maidens in the material world. Yet almost immediately, Issac noticed two distinct features. <br />
<br />
         Not on a single part of her body showed a female organ whatsoever. While she had breasts, no nipples could be seen and between her legs was nothing but a light gray patch where her female genitalia should be.<br />
<br />
   &quot;What... how do your people reproduce then? Issac asked, stunned but also trying to keep his arousal in check. Ilvir was still masturbating Andean now looking at every inch of Marty&#39;s body, admiring it as he continued to jerk off.<br />
<br />
        &quot;Most likely the same way yours do if you are indeed looking for my vagina like I believe you are.&quot; Marry said. &quot;You see, us cloud folk mature differently from how your people do. as we grow older, we change color, the youngest being a pure white and slowly transitioning into a deep gray as we age. When we reach the ends of our lifespan, we explode into rain and mist, our essence scattering into the ground to support new life. However, midway we develop our respective sexual organs and afterwards after maturing we become capable of reproduction. Before that we however do not have any feelings of romance, love, or lust. We have every other emotion you can imagine, but before our sexual maturing we cannot feel nor care about sexual pleasure in the slightest. Not even magic can change that. The grey spot between my legs signifies that soon I will develop my vagina and soon feel the emotions that plague Ilvir right now, before that though, I could care less about any lewd acts that you both do.&quot; Marry explained.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I see... now please put your armor back on...&quot; said Issac, trying not to look directly at Marry.<br />
<br />
  Marry gave a soft giggle, before redressing, taking another few minutes before she completely  strapped her armor back on, sitting back now on the soft cloud.<br />
<br />
        &quot;So then...if you are so close to maturing why come along with us?&quot; Issac asked after her silver cloudy armor was back on.<br />
<br />
 Marry&#39;s face grew serious for a moment and her face became stern as she spoke &quot;Whenever a woman matures in one of the towns or villages, the King is immediately notified and forces the women to come to his castle so he can have his way with them. He does it both for pleasure and for domination. He is already aware of my status as almost being fully matured and would no doubt send his mend to come for me once I do mature.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I see, so you don&#39;t want to experience such pain that your fellow sisters and women have faced before?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Exactly, coming along with you gives me a chance for revenge for everyone.&quot; Marry said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;That is a noble cause Marry, but I hope you do not try and do anything reckless, you may have been taught the basics of combat but only briefly. Do not try to rush in alone.&quot; Issac warned.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I know, but because of that I also wish to hurry soon, according to the Elder, I will fully mature within the next seven days, should the Cloud King&#39;s men come for me and see me missing, my entire village will be punished no doubt.&quot;<br />
<br />
      &quot;I had assumed so, then that means time is of the essence.&quot; Issac said.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Yes, it is, now speaking of which, we need to capture some creatures for you. How on earth will you fight a sky dragon if you move slower than a flail snail?&quot; Marry said, standing up.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Very well, let&#39;s go hunting then. Where to?&quot; Ilvir said, standing up, shaking his fur, spraying water everywhere.<br />
<br />
     &quot;It&#39;ll sadly be a bit of a detour, but north west of here lies the Cumulus Mountains, there packs of viscous pegasi are said to roam that region. They are renowned for their magical abilities to summon tornados and are said to be able to fly almost as fast as an air dragon!&quot;  <br />
<br />
  &quot;Interesting... I can&#39;t wait to see them up close then. Ilvir when you are done masturbating, be sure to lick up every drop of your semen, I&#39;d rather not see the result of mixing your corruption with this place.&quot; Issac said to Ilvir, who nodded as he continued to fap heavily. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Of corse my Master, just let me- HHNNGGGG!!!&quot; he screamed as he shot two loads of purple glowing semen all over his storm body in orgasm. <br />
<br />
  Issac sighed and started following Marry to their new destination.</p>
