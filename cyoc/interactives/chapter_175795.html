<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay think Tim.&quot; He muttered to himself. &quot;Put it together. There has to be a reason this happened today. So, what&#39;s different about today than yesterday.... oh shit.&quot; He thought, suddenly realizing the one item that seemed to coincide with the role swaps. &quot;The watch!&quot; He realized.<br />
<br />
He clenched his fist, and had an audible sigh of relief. During the confusion he didn&#39;t even realize he had been holding onto it, and luckily kept doing so. He quickly wrapped it around his wrist and looked it over. It seemed like a normal watch, but the large button on the side was definitely what he pressed exactly before he swapped roles with Rex.<br />
<br />
He glanced up again and saw Jennifer happily crawling down the street. Her ass giggled as she walked, and only stopped to start sniffing a fire hydrant. Tim blushed, getting secondhand embarrassment for her. Not just for her, but for himself wearing freaking women&#39;s yoga pants.<br />
&quot;Geez, thank God you think you&#39;re Rex... I would NEVER here the end of this.&quot; He mumbled under his breath.<br />
<br />
Jennifer finished sniffing, Lifted her leg, and started to pee on the hydrant. Despite being obviously still female, the pee somehow traveled and behaved as if a male dog was doing the deed. She then began to walk and Tim found himself being lurched forward alongside her.<br />
&quot;Damn, usually I can hold Rex back a bit, and I can definitely out bench Jennifer.&quot; He thought. &quot;I wonder if this thing changes some of that stuff?&quot; He wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Dammit focus Tim!&quot; He angrily thought, slapping his forehead. &quot;Your wife has the role of a freaking dog and you&#39;re thinking about how much you can lift!&quot; <br />
<br />
As he walked along, he began to stop paying attention to his surroundings. He stared deeply at the watch. It was currently set to 9 o&#39;clock, which was off but frankly he was a little scared to be fiddling with it any more than he had to. If Jennifer hadn&#39;t accidentally used the watch, he could have been the one to be trapped in the life of a dog after all.<br />
<br />
He nearly face planted as Jennifer tried to run across the street. Tim barely managed to hold her back.<br />
&quot;Woah, Jen st- I mean, down... boy.&quot; He corrected, which helped Jennifer calm down slightly but she was still wagging her ass.<br />
<br />
Tim looked across to see his neighbor Carla mowing the lawn. She was an older lady than Tim was, but wasn&#39;t old yet. She was graying, but she was one of the nicest, toughest ladies he knew. She had been a knockout a decade ago but her breasts were sagging along with her ass as the wrinkles began to creep up. But she was raised on a farm, so it&#39;d take a lot more than age to stop her.<br />
<br />
The lawnmower kept stuttering, causing Carla to be yelling something at it as she fiddled with it. Tim sighed, realizing he had distracted himself once more.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re stalling dammit.&quot; He muttered. &quot;Just hit the button and fix Jen.&quot; He said under the sounds of a sputtering lawnmower.<br />
<br />
He hit the side button then closed his eyes in fear. He opened them once more to find that he hadn&#39;t at least gotten mixed up this time, as he still was wearing Jennifer&#39;s clothing. However, his relief soon turned to a mix of horror, confusion, and curiosity. Standing in front of him, tied to the end of his leash, was a robotic monster.<br />
<br />
It was shaped generally like a dog, with a chain tail and everything, but was made of machine parts. Upon closer inspection, it looked like it was made out of a lawnmower. It looked like someone had taken apart a lawnmower and haphazardly sculpted it into the shape of a dog. The machine turned around and looked up at him, despite not having eyes, and shook its chain tail.<br />
&quot;BaRk bArK.&quot; It said, although it sounded like a lawnmower revving up in the tone of a dogs bark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-if you&#39;re the lawnmower then...&quot; He stammered just before bolting across the street.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to look, so he held his head down, but as he got to Carla, his suspicions were confirmed. His wife had swapped life roles with a lawnmower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, howdy neighbor.&quot; Carla greeted, though Tim could only give a generic &#39;hey&#39; as his eyes were fixated on his wife.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was fully naked, her hair completely shaved making her almost hairless, except for some body hair on the side which was cut in a way to spell out the brand of lawnmower. She was staring forward, no emotion in her at all. Her hands were on the ground under her while her breasts dangled just above the grass. Her legs were being held in the sky, where her feet reached just about where Carla was, almost like a handle, and her ass was slightly up in the air too, as if to be where the controls for the mower was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to bother you I was just checking out... your lawnmower.&quot; Tim added.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, this old thing? It&#39;s starting to fall apart on me.&quot; She grumbled, slapping Jennifer&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
Tim wanted to protest, but he knew he&#39;d sound delusional too Carla.<br />
&quot;So, uh, what&#39;ll you do?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feh, I don&#39;t know yet.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Tim&#39;s mouth really dropped. Carla took her fingers and stuck them straight into Jennifer&#39;s pussy, yet Jennifer still made no sound. Carla moved it back towards her clit, then began to rub and flick at it as if it was a starter of some kind. Then, Jennifer&#39;s teeth began to chatter. They began to sound so fast that if someone normal was doing it you&#39;d think they were dying of frostbite. Jennifer also began to grumble, as if imitating a lawnmower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there we go.&quot; Clara chuckled, slapping Jennifer&#39;s ass once more. <br />
<br />
She began to walk, and Jennifer&#39;s walked with her hands with her head down. Jennifer&#39;s chattering teeth began to bite the grass, and was surprisingly effective at it. Tim couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing. His wife was a freaking lawnmower and it was all his fault. He had to do something, but could he even trust himself with the watch? He could wait to experiment but what if Carla did something like throw out Jennifer? What was he to do?!</p>
