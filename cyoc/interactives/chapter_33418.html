<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Matthew walked into the immaculately clean foyer of 1313 Forandring Street, a 
building that displayed a simple turquoise 'T' outside as well as the polished white tiled 
floor inside.
<br>He looked around the empty benches as he approached the abandoned front desk.
<br> " uh... hello?" Matthew said to the empty room. Suddenly a square of wall behind the 
desk lit up like a screen, displaying the same 'T' as a cool but cheerful female voice piped 
up.
<br> " Hello, and welcome to TAG science facility 01138, may I help you?"</p>

<p>
The startled boy looked around as the voice had seemingly come out the walls. He held up 
the newspaper ad.
<br> " I'm... uh... here for the test subject... thing."
<br> " Ah of course, the new guinea pig!" The strange mechanical voice giggled, "Dr. 
Green has been waiting for you, please follow the marked path." With that a series of blue 
lights appeared on the floor leading off down a corridor that Matthew hadn't noticed 
before.</p>

<p>
"Don't I need to sign something or fill out personal information?"
<br> "Dr. Green has a consent form you need to sign but I have just gathered your 
personal information from government databanks and personal accounts." The screen 
flickered and began running through what looked like a list as the woman recited the 
information:
<br> <i> ".... Matthew Moran, 19. Born in Manchester family moved to Peculiar when he 
was 11, accent has almost disappeared. 
<br> Taking Graphic Design at Peculiar college of Art and Design, maintains a 85 average.
<br> Listing personal statistics:
<br> height: 5" 10'
<br> Caucasian 
<br> eyes: brown
<br> hair: black
<br> Has had three serious relationships in the last five years, currently single... and 
unemployed..."</i> </p>

<p>
Matthew blush deeply, rather taken aback by how much this woman knows about you " 
Unemployed, well, that's why I'm here I guess." He managed to mumble.
<br> She gave another light giggle as the screen powered down, becoming part of the 
wall, " Please follow the marked path Mr. Moran, don't keep Dr.Green waiting." </p>

<p>
As the mysterious woman finished the young man began following the blue lights down 
the corridor. He looked around for something like speakers but there was absolutely 
nothing distinguishable in the corridor. Long featureless tiles polished to near reflection, 
but that was it, even the blue lights shone as if from up out of the ground.
<br>Eventualy the line of lights ended at a dark rectangle about the size of a door, and of 
course it slid open revealing what looked like a typical examination room. Matthew looked 
around curiously when a voice suddenly came from his left,
<br>" Hello Matthew, Gina said you'd be here by now."
<br> Matthew whipped around and looked on the man who just came in the side door. He 
was short with a mess of peppered grey hair that looked like it had never been combed, 
the man seemed to have something about him though, a certain 'trustworthiness' about 
him. Through his stubble he wore a warm smile, pushing up his glasses he shrugged on a 
clean lab coat and continued with the slightest hint of a Scottish accent.
<br>"Sorry to startle you, boy. I was just saying how Gina told me you'd find your way 
here." He extended his hand and Matthew shook it, still feeling completely disoriented,
<br>"Yeah, um... Gina is uh your receptionist?" He asked referring to the strange voice 
from the empty waiting room. At this Dr. Green let out a deep chuckle and patted the 
young man on the shoulder,</p>

<p>
"Oh no, boy. Gina is the computer that runs this facility, our receptionist quit a couple 
weeks ago and she's been filling in as best she can. She didn't frighten you did she?"</p>

<p>
"No it just freaked me out a bit. The voice coming out of the walls I mean." Matthew said 
with a nervous chuckle.</p>
<p>
"Well no need to worry," the kindly old doctor said, producing a clipboard from a drawer, 
"She's really very nice.Now if you can just sign these then we can get started."</p>

<p>
Matthew took the clipboard and gave the paper a quick once over. It looked like the 
typical release form like the one his friend had told him about when he had gone and 
tested sleeping pills for some big pharmaceuticals company the other week. Actually 
that's why Matthew was here right now, because his friend had gone on about how easy 
this was.
<br> Without reading it fully (who does?) he scribbled his signature across the bottom 
and handed it back to the doctor whose kind face widened in a smile.
<br>" So what do I do?" Matthew asked, still quite a bit nervous. In answer the doctor 
pulled a small red pill out of his lab pocket,
<br>"Take the red pill, and see how deep the rabbit hole goes." The doctor let out a deep 
laugh and wiped a tear from his eye,
<br>"Sorry, just take this, I'll jot a few notes down and then you can pick up your check." 
He offered the pill to Matthew.</p>

<p>
After considering the pill for a second Matthew gingerly took it from the doctor and 
swallowed it, washing it down with a glass of water the doctor had offered.
<br>"So what does it do?"
<br> Dr. Green smiled, "Well we're about to find out."</p>

<p>
The glass smashed on the floor, Matthew hadn't noticed he had dropped it but there it was 
on the clean white tiles, smashed to bits. Matthew continued to watch as the pieces of 
glass became liquid and flowed together into a puddle of water, a spreading puddle of 
water. Without warning the young man fell down into the icy depths of the glass, bubbles 
spewed from his mouth as opera played somewhere in the distance as Matthew was 
dragged down. Down to the black depths of wherever he was.
<br><i> White. Nothing. Matthew hung floating in a vast sea of white. He tried to move 
but found he just didn't want to. His body felt weird, tingly. Like it was rippling and 
contorting, it didn't hurt though; it felt like someone was rubbing warm vaseline all over 
him. Then he was falling, or something was rushing up at him with tremendous speed and 
a sound of thunder that reverberated through his entire body.</p>

<p> 
His feet made contact with solid ground as thunder gave way to pulsing club music, it 
blasted through the writhing, dancing bodies as neon colours wove a tapestry across his 
vision. Only he wasn't a 'he' anymore, or anything for that matter, nothing existed but the 
club and the dancing. Matthew felt his hips gyrate to the beat and tight clothes hug his 
altered form, his body was drastically changed but as the music flowed through him all he 
cared about was dancing. He was free, he was himself and no one could take that away 
from him.</p>

<p>
Light, the sound of thunder reverberated again and soon became the animalistic noises of 
passionate love. He looked on from every angle at once at two bodies writhing and 
humping in ecstasy on the bed. Two sets of male moans rose from the scene as Matthew 
found his own lust rise with theirs until he could take no more of it.</p>

<p>
Light, thunder, running. Matthew thrust himself through the woods with speed and agility 
he had never known before. His sleek, toned legs pumped and hurdled him through the 
underbrush, over the river. The sense of peace and freedom returned with vigor and he 
never wanted to leave, he always wanted to feel the wind pass over his beautiful, elegant 
naked form. He was servant and master of these woods, his home.</p>

<p>
Light, thunder that became cries of agony as Matthew felt his awareness fracture, taking 
in every angle of a dark desolate alleyway as a giant of a man took advantage of the 
screaming woman, pounding into her with terrible force. He found he could not turn away, 
forced to watch this disgusting scene he found his arousal again growing, watching the 
woman, helpless and innocent. Yet he was disgusted at the actions of the man, who would 
deflower such a picture of grace.
<br> Though these thoughts were pushed from his mind as lust and arousal took a front 
seat until finally his body exploded into light and he became a being of sheer bliss. 
Colours thundered through him and around him. The heavens opened up and choirs of 
angels sung his name with joy, for he was born again.</i></p>

<p>
Light. No. Fluorescent light. Someone was calling his name. Matthew blinked as he felt his 
back rest on the cold, tiled floor. The broken glass lay beside him and the worried face of 
Dr. Green hung overhead, the lights illuminating him from behind like an angel.
<br> "Thank god you're okay, son."
<br> Matthew groaned weakly and rubbed his head, "How long have I been out?"</p>
<p>
<br> "Matthew... you've only just fallen down." Matthew twisted around and looked at the 
clock on the wall in alarm, sure enough, though it had felt like an eternity, what had 
happened to him had been about two seconds.</p>
<p>
Dr. Green helped Matthew to his feet and led him to the door, "I know it would be best to 
talk now, when whatever happened is fresh in your mind but you're in no state. Go home, 
get some rest and come back tomorrow. I won't give you anymore pills."
<br> He smiled at the doctor and mumbled a 'sorry, thank you, see you tomorrow.'</p>

<p>
Matthew wandered down the hall to the foyer and found a check waiting on the still empty 
desk. After mumbling a response when the computer 'Gina' wished him a pleasant day, he 
wandered back to his tiny apartment a couple blocks down the road.
<br> Closing and locking the door behind him he heads straight to the bed and collapses 
in it, not even taking off his shoes.
<br> He tried to remember what had happened after he took the pill, but all he could 
recall were fast moving shapes and bright colours, eventually he stopped caring and 
drifted into a deep sleep.</p></p>
