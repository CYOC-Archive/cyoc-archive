<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angelica decided to go with Jane, to help her reveal the truth to her family. The plan was to enter wile she was in her true form, but with the demoness still in her human guise. Then, they will explain the truth, with Jane changing back to being Janith at a key moment.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a foolproof plan, but it was the better plan for that kind of situation.<br />
<br />
Alas, things rarely goes according to plan. When they entered, Janith&#39;s older daughter was here, crying. The base of her back now harboring a long tail, ending in a white heart-shaped spatula, and littles white horns poking out of her forehead.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t the strangest part of the scene. The only one to be with the girl, in the middle of the room, was her boyfriend, hugging her, trying to soothes her fears. &quot;Shh… Don&#39;t cry Julie, don&#39;t cry. I&#39;m not going to abandon you, I promise, I&#39;m not. You&#39;re not at fault. I don&#39;t know what happened, but it&#39;s not your fault, it can&#39;t. How can the girl that made ME believe in god, made me go to church, be a demoness? It&#39;s thanks to you that I want to help and protect others, Julie. Without you, I would still be a bully, finding morbid happiness in the suffering of others.&quot; Confessed the boy. &quot;So I don&#39;t care what you look like, don&#39;t care about what others will say! Your still the one that make me see the light, my little angel. And I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But… But… But I… was about to eat your soul! I was about to, I sensed it! You almost become a soulless monster!&quot; Retorted Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe…&quot; Acknowledged her boyfriend. &quot;But you stopped yourself on your own will. I know what happened only thanks to your honesty, because you refused to hide it from me. It&#39;s enough to prove you&#39;re not the monster you&#39;re thinking.&quot; They were now both crying, shedding pristine tears.<br />
<br />
William, however, was devoured by fear. As surrealist as it might seems, to him she wasn&#39;t Julie anymore. Either his daughter&#39;s soul got eaten by the hellish monster now inhabiting her body, or a demon truly corrupted Julie to the core. So he stayed as far away from his own daughter as he was able without loosing her from his sight, using his arms as barriers, to prevent the remaining kids to approach that dreadful thing.<br />
<br />
He was so convinced it was the truth that, for him, the lovely exchange between the two teenagers was only lies, at least on the demoness part. But he wouldn&#39;t discard the possibility for the boy to be another demons, only playing the part of the trusting lover.<br />
	<br />
Seeing all that was breaking Janith heart. She was about to go hug her distressed daughter and blurt out the truth. But without a word, Angelica stopped her, blocking Jane with her wing, before shaking her head a way that clearly said &quot;no&quot;.<br />
<br />
The angel then calmly approached Julie, a sincere smile on her mouth. &quot;Your boyfriend said the truth, you know. You didn&#39;t do anything wrong, and your not responsible for your family&#39;s legacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie was about to ask what the angelic figure mean by &#39;family&#39;s legacy&#39;, but didn&#39;t get the time. Angelica was now going in William&#39;s direction, a far more severe expression on her face. &quot;Speaking of legacy&quot; she said, facing the now panicking father. &quot;I was expecting much better from a man able to show the divine light to a demoness. Or did your ignorance of her true nature was the only reason you were able to convert your wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seemingly obvious to the fact that, upon earing what she just said, everyone around her gasped, the Angel continued. &quot;I can&#39;t blame you for envisaging Julia got either possessed or corrupted, I can&#39;t. But what I can blame you for, is not envisaging she might be the daughter you love, regardless of the few demonic attributes she manifested! You SHOULD have envisaged that, and let her a chance, even if she didn&#39;t happen to be half-succubus! After all, that wouldn&#39;t be the first time a demon modified the body of an unknowing victim!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t blame this on the fact your wife hide her true nature to you.&quot; Angelica added. &quot;True, she shouldn&#39;t have done that. But your reaction was still very wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Willy…&quot; Finally spoke Jane, wile crying. &quot;You can hate me for lying to you all these years. You can hate me for loving you from all my heart. You can hate me from tonight debacle. But please, don&#39;t hate Julie for something that&#39;s not her fault, don&#39;t hate her for what she is. Our daughter didn&#39;t choose to have a succubus for mother.&quot; The heart-broken demoness was slowly turning back to her true self, not even trying to maintain her human guise anymore.<br />
<br />
William&#39;s heart was torn. On one side, that thing was a succubus, a man eating demoness. But on the other side, that crying mess… The only time his wife that much of a wreck, when… And now this thing, the way it was acting… It was like…<br />
And then he realized that, somehow, it truly was the love of his life. It wasn&#39;t a possessed or a corrupted Jane, no. He truly was this demoness husband.<br />
<br />
But even knowing that it really was his kind and loving wife, she still was a succubus. He loved her as much as ever, but he feared what she was just as much. &quot;I… Don&#39;t know what to think.&quot; He finally confessed. &quot;I know it&#39;s truly you inside this hellish body. You, the heart-strong but kind wife I know as Jane, who wouldn&#39;t do anything bad to me. I KNOW all that. But at the same time, you&#39;re a demoness. A succubus even, you said so yourself! And… And quite frankly, I fear WHAT you are as much as I love WHO you are.&quot; All that to finally conclude &quot;I… Digesting all that… I will need time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take all the time you need, Willy.&quot; Answered Janith. &quot;And don&#39;t hesitate to ask about anything you wish to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, but it can wait tomorrow. It&#39;s late, we should all go to bed.&quot; Said an exhausted William.<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on, Janith and Julie should stay in their demonic form when at home.&quot; Intervened Angelica. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I casted a perception filter on this house, no one beside who is currently inside can see they aren&#39;t their human self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even KNOW how to change back!&quot; remarked an exasperated Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow I will give you lessons on our powers, Julie.&quot; Assured the demonic mother, before saying to her husband. &quot;You can have our bed Willy, demons don&#39;t need much to sleep comfortably.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t accept that, Jane! Or is it Janith? Anyway, YOU should have the bed. As a gentleman and your husband, it&#39;s ME who&#39;s going to sleep on the couch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Err… Since we&#39;re speaking slipping arrangement, do you have a guest-room or something? I&#39;m don&#39;t know how I can hope to go back home this late.&quot; Asked Julie&#39;s boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Janith answered &quot;If you&#39;re fine with sharing with my husband, you can use my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!? NO!&quot; Protested said husband.<br />
<br />
Seeing that they weren&#39;t going anywhere, Angelica choose to take care of the sleeping arrangements herself. &quot;Since you can&#39;t decide who sleep were by yourself, I&#39;m deciding this for you. Janith and William, go put the kids in their beds, then go to your own. I don&#39;t care if that make any of you uncomfortable, you should have ended the thing by yourself.&quot; Then, turning to the boyfriend, she added &quot;And since no one is going to use it tonight, you can sleep on the sofa. But you should call your parents before, to reassure them, let them know you&#39;re fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;<br />
<br />
When she knew with certainty that everyone was sleeping, Angelica cautiously observed the tube in which she discretely collected a fews of Julie&#39;s tears. The half-demoness got the purest soul to walk on earth since long. The tears would help her know how pure exactly. But if they were as pure as the angel believed, then…</p>
