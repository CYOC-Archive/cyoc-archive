<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiff's eyes opened wide as she felt the gun press into her side but when she saw what it was she smiled.  &quot;Come on Katie, that ray gun granted my wish.  That wish hasn't changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled back, feeling her heart racing and her mind begin to fill lust as she saw what her mother was doing to her brother.  She had a powerful urge to strip off her clothes and join in but she was able to resist it.  &quot;I know, but this is for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie twisted the gun around and shot herself the blast knocked the two of them apart.  Tiff was thrown against the wall and slumped from the force of the blow.  As she was trying to get her bearings, Tiff heard two more shots fire off and hit Katie's brother and mom.  Tiff felt her connection to the two break and her strength diminished so that she felt like she had just run a mile as hard as she could.  Panting she looked at her former slaves and Justin completing his transformation into a German Shepard.  Justin was sniffing Suzy as her skin lightened back to its original color and she began to shrink until she was a little 7 year old girl.  Tiffany was interested to see that the girl's eyes and hair had changed so that they were both green.  Suzy was staring at her with fear her little hands balled up and her eyes beginning to water.  Tiff thought she might be able to make use of the two still but she needed to get that ray gun away from Katie first.  When Tiff looked over to Katie she watched in fascination.<br />
<br />
Katie's glasses fell off her face as she was on her hands and knees, shaking wildly.  She began panting and moaning, bringing Tiff to a state of excitement.  Apparently Katie's gamble didn't pay off, Tiff thought to herself, Katie must've been affected by my power and now she will be a demon like me anyways.  It takes all the fun out of taking her, Tiff pouted.<br />
<br />
Katie's ear began to grow out in points and her eyes changed from brown to a soothing blueish green, and her cute, innocent face shifted so that her eyes had a slight slant to them and her lips became full and red.  Katie's raven hair began to grow till it covered her beautiful face and touched the ground.  Then Katie's shirt began to bulge under new pressure and began to rip along the sides as she developed a full size D breasts.  Tiff was enraptured by the beauty that Katie now possessed and the sounds she was making with the sweet sound of cloth tearing.  Tiff got behind Katie and put out her finger to trace it across Katie's full ass.  Tiff cried out in pain and pulled back her hand, feeling as though she had just stuck her finger into an electrical socket.<br />
<br />
Katie, finished with her changes, stood in front of Tiff, her clothes falling off her gorgeous body, which glowed with its own inner light.  What remained of her shirt was torn to shreds as white bird wings sprang from her back.  Tiff gave a scream of the damned at the sight of Katie as an angel, a literal avatar of the light, of good, of love.  Everything she stood against.  Katie's very proximity even sapped her strength even further.  She was to weak to kill Katie or to force her to her will.  Tiff was even to weak now to run away.  Tiff noticed however that the same was true of Katie.  Fresh into her change, she would still be weak and would be susceptible to Tiff's influence.  The only way she would survive would be to trick Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's over Tiffany.&quot; Katie said, &quot;You won't have my brother and mother, and in this form you can not have me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you so smart?  But tell me this, how do you plan on surviving?  It won't be long till our dual natures kill us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie froze as she realized that Tiff was right.  She lost her balance and sprawled out on the floor.  Katie was too weak to survive the loss of her strength.  &quot;I don't know Tiff.  I made this form, using a part of what you gave me.  The lust, the fear, the greed, the sin, reversed it to make this angel.  It was the only way I could think to defeat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiff fell to the floor as well but she posed for Katie so that she would get a view of her legs and breasts.  &quot;I guess that means we're playing by rules then.  A final matching of our powers then, whoever is the strongest will turn the other into a match of them.  We may both be dying, but I don't plan on going with you when you croak under my dark powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie began to crawl toward Tiff.  Every move she made toward her only increased her weakness and a horrible migraine began to pound in her head.  Katie didn't like this plan at all but she had tried her best and there was nothing more she could do.  She didn't want to die and if she had to become a monster to survive then at least she had tried to be a hero.<br />
<br />
Tiff bared her fangs and lunged at Katie and weak as she was Katie was barely able to hold her off.  As both struggled for survival in that moment, Tiff's breasts began to drip black fluid onto Katie's face.  Katie focused her energy into her hands and a golden glow began to work its way from her hands up Tiff's arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Katie, have a drink.&quot;</p>
