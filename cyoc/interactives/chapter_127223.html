<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie woke early the next morning. At peace with the realization that she could never go back to how things were. Still she felt their was unfinished work to be done. Making her way downstairs Katie could see Lisa drinking coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning mom,&quot; she said giving her a hug. Lisa smiled as she looked at her niece. &quot;Morning kid your up early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she pulled up a chair. &quot;Yeah I guess,&quot; she said. &quot;Kind of want to get a early start to the day.&quot; Lisa grinned, enjoying the fact her niece wanted to embrace the day. &quot;Good to hear that,&quot; she said. &quot;Kind of doing the same. I&#39;m meeting up with Jason later for lunch. Kellie said she would babysit so taking advamtage of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie paused as she looked at her aunt. &quot;Mom can i ask you a question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure kiddo you can ask me anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she looked at her aunt. &quot;Do you ever regret taking me in,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean you were so young, only 19, barely an adult yourself. Do you ever wonder what your life would of been like if you didn&#39;t have this responsibility?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa gave her niece a sincere look, taking her nieces hand in her own. &quot; Well thats a tough question but I&#39;m guessing you want an honest answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded. Lisa was always honest with her, part of the reason she respected and loved her so much.<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed before smiling. &quot;Ive always been straight with you Katie since day one,&quot; she said. &quot;At first yeah it was hard and I didn&#39;t want the responsibilty. My sister was dead and I was left with an infant. Everything seemed so unfair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now,&quot; Katie asked anxiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t even think of life without you Katie,&quot; she said. &quot;Yeah things haven&#39;t been easy, yeah I worry about whether im doing as well as your mom would&#39;ve, but I wouldnt trade this for anything. I love you more than I&#39;ve loved anything in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as Lisa wiped a tear from her eye. Before either could say anything else they found themselves hugging eachother crying silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too Lisa,&quot; Katie said. &quot;And I think mom would be proud of how you raised me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks kid,&quot; Lisa sniffed.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she began to walk towards the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey where you going?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
Katie turned to face her aunt, still smiling. &quot;Gotta see Kellie real quick,&quot; she said. &quot;Be back soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well put some shoes on or something your still in your p.j&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie bounded out the door barefoot. The morning dew soaked her feet as she ran towards Kellies. Happy she had made the right choice with Lisa she now needed to talk with Kellie. Standing on their front porch Katie knocked furiously. Maggie now answered the door, still dressed in a robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie your here early,&quot; Maggie stated in surprise. &quot;Let me go check to see if Kellie is up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maggie turned and began to call for her daughter. Soon Katie could see Kellie approach. The girl was dressed in a pair of sweat shorts topped with a t-shirt and robe. Katie suppressed a giggle as she looked at Kellies morning hair. &quot;Nice hair Kel,&quot; Katie giggled. &quot;Mind if we talk in private.&quot; Kellie nodded as the two made their way outside. <br />
<br />
As the two now sat down Kellie tucked her legs under her and gazed at her girlfriend. &quot;Everything okay Kat it&#39;s kinda early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she lovingly gazed at her girlfriend. &quot;Yeah everythings fine,&quot; she said. &quot;Just had a bad dream. Wanted to talk with you about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie placed her hand on her girlfriend and smiled. &quot;Well go ahead whats on your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie now began to formulate how to talk with Kellie about the other reality. Kellie had knowledge of it now but considered it to be a wish they did together, which they reversed. Kellies thoughts on this right now were the most important thing in the world to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kellie do you remember when I became seven and you were my mom,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea I remember,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;You were adorable at that age by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie giggled as she playfully slugged her girlfriend in the arm. &quot;Oh thanks,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it alot lately. I was wondering what you thought. I kind of had a different perspective on things than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie paused as she looked out at the street. &quot;Well being your mom was great,&quot; she said. &quot;You were an angel even if I was a bit over protective and having your aunt as my kid sister made things even better but....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed sadly as she looked at Katie. &quot;I wasn&#39;t me,&quot; she said. &quot;My parents. At least the ones in that reality never accepted me as a lesbian. They disowned me. I was alone and the guy that was you dad in that reality held it over my head that you were is daughter. I was miserable and alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Katie whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault. In fact I&#39;m glad i did it. It makes me appreciate my folks that much more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never realized just how bad things were for you Kel,&quot; Katie said. &quot;When i was your daughter I thought you the best. You always looked over me and made me feel safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw thanks Kat,&quot; Kellie blushed. &quot;Guess I did a  good job as a mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you ever wish you could live that life Kellie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kellie said tensely. &quot;As much as I loved being your mom. As much as I loved having Lisa as a sister. It was a miserable, lonely, life. After you would go to bed I would cry myself to sleep. I&#39;m so glad we changed back after a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie grinned as she looked at her girlfriend. While Kellie now saw their former reality as nothing more than a wish they made it made Katie confident that she had made the right decision. &quot;I&#39;m glad we did too, &quot; she said. &quot;That whole world kind of scares me. It bugs me how real it seemed. Guess I haven&#39;t gotten over it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie leaned over and gently kissed Katie on the cheek. &quot;It was a bad dream thats all,&quot; Kellie said in an almost motherly tone. &quot;Things are back the way they should be. We&#39;re together and nothing is going to change that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she leaned into her girlfriend. &quot;I love you Kel,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I really, truly, love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls lingered like that for sometime staring out at the street in only their p.j&#39;s. Maggie yelling for Kellie to come inside broke their embrace. &quot;I gotta get going,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;But hey if you want to hangout later come by. Maybe we could have some fun with the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and nodded. &quot;Sounds like a great plan,&quot; she said. &quot;Besides it&#39;ll give you a chamce to fix your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie laughed as she pushed her girlfriend. &quot;Your a jerk but I love you,&quot; she giggled. Both girls waved goodbye as they went into their homes. The day ahead was certainly full of possiblities.</p>
