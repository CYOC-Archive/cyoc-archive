<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke groaned as he woke up the next morning, the events of the previous day only slowly coming back to him. It all seemed unreal, like a dream or a nightmare. However, once he let his gaze wander through the room, he was fully awake in an instant.<br />
There, on his coffee table, was Matt; sleeping, curled up and completely naked.<br />
That meant everything did really happen! Luke needed a smoke badly as this realization settled in.<br />
While he was already searching for his pack of cigarettes, he stopped in his track. Wasn&#39;t smoking what started this all yesterday? And didn&#39;t Matt start behaving strangely and ... changing when he had a smoke in his room yesterday?  Luke rubbed his temples. He didn&#39;t know how exactly, but it seemed to be connected. Even though it was killing him, he retracted his hand and woke up Matt instead by shaking his shoulder.<br />
<br />
When Matt woke up, the first thing he noticed was the disgusting taste of ash, cold tobacco and cigarette stumps in his mouth, which he quickly swallowed before even thinking about it.<br />
&quot;What... happend?&quot; he asked, although yesterday&#39;s events were clearly present to him.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why or how, but you kind of... changed yesterday? Do you remember?&quot; Luke answered, distracting himself from the desire to smoke.<br />
Matt just nodded.<br />
&quot;I think I have a theory.&quot; Luke continued. &quot;Since we met, everytime I had the need to smoke you behaved like you were my ashtray. And then you even... Turned into one. And it seemed so normal right then!&quot; Luke shook his head.<br />
&quot;But no worries. I&#39;m just suppressing my need for a cigarette until you&#39;re gone, so whatever happened won&#39;t happen again&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Good!&quot; Matt exclaimed, although he didn&#39;t really feel like it. The experience of being used, even in a objectively humiliating way had been... Intense. Erotic even. Just thinking about it, Matt realized he was getting hard. While he was sitting on Luke&#39;s coffee table. Completely naked.<br />
Matt blushed deeply and mubled something about morning wood while diving for his boxers.<br />
&quot;Sorry about that&quot;, he added. &quot;Well, eh, good thing you can go a bit without a cigarette, I guess&quot; he tried to relax the situation.<br />
<br />
Luke was also pretty embarassed by the situation. He didn&#39;t exactly plan on having some guy, naked, with morning wood on his table, so he gladly took the opportunity.<br />
&quot;Ya, no worries, I will manage. To be honest, right now, way more than I need a smoke, I need to piss!&quot; he sayed, and laughed.<br />
His laughter died a moment later when he thought about what he said, leading to a moment of uncomfortable silence between the two.<br />
&quot;But of course... I mean, I wouldn&#39;t even consider, you know...&quot; <br />
Now it was Luke&#39;s turn to blush. That was getting ridiculous. There was no magic curse or anything that would suddenly cause him to do something as perverted as pee on another person. Ew! Just the thought disgusted him. The thought of doing something like that to another man, of course, he mused, as he lazily watched new stains appear on the carpet and noticed some new smells mix into the stale air. He was pretty much into watersports, but girls only. He wasn&#39;t some kind of fag, to be sure. That&#39;s why he couldn&#39;t stay in his dorm room after all - he had been asked to leave because his rooms were dirty and stinking - that&#39;s why he was living in a small flat.<br />
&quot;At least not to a *guy*&quot;, he added to his previous sentence, as the surroundings subtly shifted around them, rearranging to a cheap and somewhat dirty flat.<br />
<br />
Neither the changing surroundings nor the slight change in Luke&#39;s behavior escaped Matt. He had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen if he didn&#39;t escape the situation right now, but...<br />
His erection was throbbing in his boxers. He had never felt so aroused in his life. He was craving to be used, even abused. He could not just run away now, he needed this.<br />
&quot;You can use me if you like, really. It&#39;s not that big of a deal.&quot; He croaked, and as he saw Luke hesitating, he added &quot;Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke shrugged. He did have to piss badly and it was undeniable that Matt was far more conveniently placed than his bathroom. Also, he didn&#39;t seem to mind.<br />
Luke got up and flopped his dick out. &quot;Ok I guess&quot; he said to Matt and shoved the other man to his knees roughly. It felt relieving as he started to piss a strong stream of yellow liquid, soaking both Matt and his carpet.<br />
<br />
Matt felt blissful as the stream of urine hit him full front. He was was drenched in a few moments, but he felt just so good! His cock felt like it was gonna burst a sense of purpose filled him. He opened his mouth, gurgling trying to gulp down as much of the acrid tasting liquid as he could. This was what Luke needed now, an urinal. So Matt needed to be an urinal, and he was enjoying every second of it.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the stream subsided and Luke sighed. The urinal... No, Matt was still kneeling in the puddle of piss in his filthy flat, but it didn&#39;t really seem particularly out of the ordinary for Luke. He lit a smoke while thinking about what to do today, occasionally dropping ash into the urinal.</p>
