<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>trying to avoid &#39;exposing&#39; Jeff&#39;s condition to anyone too soon, as that fear of being discovered is part of the titillation, right? Excuse the pun :) Got some ideas where I want to go with this, but I probably won&#39;t write it that way too quickly. If you want to go that path though, have fun!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wetness engulfed him, in a rush of cold surprise. Hitting the water feet first in his haste to get in, he lingered underwater for a moment or two before breaking the surface to look around. The pool was a good size, and nearer the shallow end, three of Tim Ferguson&#39;s friends were goofing around. There had been a couple of other people when he went into the pool shed to change, but they had exited the pool in the meanwhile, leaving just the kids. A couple of adults were leaning on the other side of the pool fence, chatting and laughing -- but not at him, just with each other -- drinks in hand, largely ignoring what was going on. Best of all, apparently his mom had departed to go back to socialising, convinced her lesson in etiquette and manners had been sufficiently humbling.<br />
<br />
Breathing a sigh of relief, Jeff swam along to the deeper end of the pool. He felt refreshed after being forced to overheat wearing excess clothes to hide his involuntary change, and a bit calmer now that he had avoided most of the danger. The water surrounding his mostly-naked body was welcome, but as he leaned against the back edge of the pool, an overhanging tree creating just the right amount of shade, he realised something was a bit ... off. The water flowing around his crotch felt different from what he was used to, the spongy breast-flesh fluttering and rippling from the currents in a way that was both alien and very pleasant. It wasn&#39;t that though, because he could feel the swimsuit&#39;s front material pressing tighter to the left side, and the unexpected sensation of open water against his sensitive lower female nipple. Peering down at himself through the distortion of the moving water, with growing alarm Jeff understood what had happened.<br />
<br />
Either during his jump in, or swimming to the deep end, the narrow strip of material had come loose. It had slipped off where it was precariously balanced, sliding down to nestle in his groin next to his left thigh. The entire crotch-breast was exposed underwater, freed from what little protection the swimsuit was giving it, and Jeff stared in horror at the potentially humiliating wardrobe malfunction. He basically WAS naked, with the one saving grace being it was hard for anybody else to tell right at that moment. He had to fix this! He had to adjust the swimsuit before another person had even a chance to suspect anything!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff!&quot; Brianna appeared without warning, having approached unnoticed in his moment of terrified introspection. She was dumping a couple of towels on the grass close to them, before she sat on the edge a few feet away, her feet dangling in the water. She was in a red two-piece identical to the one he was wearing, and with her cute girl-next-door vibe, friendly attitude, and fit appearance, she made for quite the attractive image to his teenage male brain. Jeff wanted to admire his crush, and impress her.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, his heart was in his mouth, and his mind was in a state of panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey Brianna,&quot; he stuttered.<br />
<br />
She slipped into the water, flinching for a second at the change in temperature, before leaning against the poolside too, and smiled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s my bikini fit?&quot; She giggled for a second and bit her lip. &quot;I know your mom was just being strict like a mom would, but I thought it might be fun to suggest it. I guess you don&#39;t need the top, but the bottom? Most guys our age wouldn&#39;t have the balls to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff cringed internally, the joking comment hitting far closer to home than she realised. He literally had no balls. No cock either, for that matter. With the source of his masculinity gone -- just temporarily, of course, right? he reminded himself -- was he even considered a boy? What gender did having a crotch-breast make him? What would she think if she saw him naked right now?<br />
<br />
Brianna leaned forward a little, playfully trying to get a better look through the churning water, but Jeff&#39;s fear made him think and act quickly. He crossed his arms underwater in front of his crotch, blocking the view.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry, I-I-I&#39;m really self-conscious.&quot; Jeff stammered, super nervous. He was trying desperately not to freak out about coming so close to disaster. &quot;I- ... I don&#39;t want anyone to s-see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Straight away, she backed off, and her teasing look instantly became apologetic. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to make you uncomfortable. I won&#39;t peek, I promise.&quot; She smiled again, seeming to understand. &quot;I won&#39;t force you to expose yourself wearing that -- we can just chill out here for now, if you want. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re self conscious though,&quot; she went on, &quot;because, if you don&#39;t mind a compliment, I thought you looked just fine before. I&#39;m actually glad you came, it&#39;s just kids and old people as far as the eye can see out there.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Having somebody my age to talk to is awesome, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he agreed. <br />
<br />
Changing the topic, Brianna began to ask and chat about things they might have in common -- music, favourite TV shows and movies, and so on. Jeff began to relax a little bit. He had already thought she was cool, and her kind treatment of him when he was (unbeknownst to her) in such a terrible spot was only making his crush grow stronger. Though, he badly wanted to reach down and adjust the skimpy material so it was at least providing some coverage, he knew he couldn&#39;t do so without appearing very suspicious.<br />
<br />
Instead, he just tried to act natural. He kept his answers to their conversation as normal as possible, and tried to focus on her, but it was difficult. The shifting water was like an invisible grip that kept shimmying his crotch-breast up and down, left and right. It was very distracting, but even more so how it seemed to caress and brush the super-responsive nub of his teat, as if the pool itself was trying to mess with him by playing tricks on his body.<br />
<br />
It was around half an hour later that their casual conversation was interrupted by the three kids finally getting out of the pool. Two things happened after this, almost simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Brianna suggested they get out of the pool too, get dressed, and do something else, as they were starting to get to the waterlogged prune stage. She pulled herself up the side and went for their towels, giving Jeff a wonderful view of her dripping wet bikini-clad body.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a tingle in his lower nipple, the constant stimulation of the water and the view of Brianna finally getting to him. With a tiny pulse, the crotch-breast grew very slightly heavier, thicker, fatter -- Jeff wasn&#39;t sure how he felt such a small change, but he could tell it happened. He was becoming &#39;erect&#39;, and inside the mammary, the reservoir of milk had grown in volume just a little more. It wasn&#39;t going to be a problem like his bladder would, but if he stayed turned on for too long? If he let the problem get out of hand?<br />
<br />
For now, Jeff had a more simple problem: getting out of the pool. At least there was nobody around but Brianna, and she had shown she was considerate of him -- he just had to be very careful about how he climbed out. She was handing him a towel, and ...</p>
