<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A window popped up.<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN MATCHED WITH DYLAN.<br />
ITEM REQUESTED: SPEEDO.<br />
DURATION: 4 HRS.<br />
<br />
Matt read it over and over. He got up from the computer. This couldn’t be real, could it? Then, as he looked around the room, he saw it change and flicker. The room was darkening, getting smaller. His bedroom was changing into what looked like the sauna at the tri-leisure centre downtown. It was dark, and the pleasant scent of wood filled Matt’s senses.<br />
<br />
“Over here man.” A voice called. Matt spun around to see a man who looked to be 20-ish. <br />
<br />
“Glad you’re here,” said the man. “The swim meet starts in 10 minutes and I forgot my suit at home like an idiot. If I miss another practice coach is gonna kill me.”<br />
<br />
Barely processing this information, Matt replied “are you Dylan?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah man.” Said Dylan. He got up and walked over to Matt. Dylan was very fit, a champion swimmer for his college team. He had cute dimples and short blonde hair. Matt gulped.<br />
<br />
“You’re really helping me out man, thanks.” Dylan said, as he began to stroke the back of Matt’s head. “You’re definitely the cutest guy I’ve ordered so far. I’m glad I shaved this morning. You’re gonna love it.”<br />
<br />
Matt was going to say something, but Dylan leaned in and kissed him. Softly at first, then hard. As their tounges met, Matt became aware that he was suddenly naked. His clothes had disappeared. Now his face was moving down Dylan’s shredded, hairless chest, his head being pushed by Dylan’s hand. The towel fell away, and Matt was face to face with Dylan’s cock. Dylan had shaved this morning. Matt looked up, to see Dylan’s angular face smile at him. Looking back, Matt opened his mouth and began to suck Dylan’s cock.<br />
<br />
Dylan watched Matt greedily deep throat his 10 inch dick, thinking to himself how much he loved the chronivac he downloaded last week. Matt started to suck slower and longer, placing his hands around Dylan’s fatless waist for support. His hands began to move around the hips towards Dylan’s ass cheeks. Matt moved his legs forward to better support himself. He was too distracted, but his body was lightening. With strength Matt did not previously possess, he was slowly curling his legs and torso between Dylan’s legs. <br />
<br />
Matt’s hands continued exploring Dylan’s body, now cupping his ass cheeks. Dylan was so hot, if only he could feel more of his body, Matt thought. And then, through the magic of the chronivac, Matt did just that. His hands began to stretch, cupping Dylan’s sculpted ass cheeks first softly, then more firmly, pulling them up slightly. His arms began to tighten around Dylan’s waist as crunching sounds filled the air. Matt’s arms were slowly squishing against Dylan’s hips, his bones dissolving. <br />
<br />
Matt moaned with pleasure as he sucked Dylan’s cock, and Dylan looked down to watch the cute guy’s body begin to shrink to fit around his crotch. Matt’s legs were pulling up towards Dylan’s ass, his own lifting up from the ground. If not for the chronivac, the maneuver Matt was pulling off would have taken core strength even Dylan did not possess. The shrinking legs and torso rubbed against Dylan’s thighs as they moved upward, reaching the flattening remains of Matt’s hands. Matt’s feet began to press against the flattened hands, and then sink into them, merging. Matt was so focused on the rhythmic sucking motions his head was making he didn’t notice. As Matt’s feet disappeared into the increasingly spandex-like material covering Dylan’s ass, his shrinking legs and torso were pulling up and tightening between Dylan’s ass cheeks and thighs. Matt’s neck sunk into his torso as his upper body condensed into itself, shrinking and stretching underneath Dylan’s torso. Matt was oblivious, only comprehending that he could now more comfortably fit Dylan’s cock into his mouth as his head began to subtly distort. Matt’s mouth opened wider, welcoming Dylan’s balls inside as well. <br />
<br />
Matt now began to squeeze what was left of his arms against Dylan’s waist, flattening them into perfect spandex. His head was losing definition, his hair having pulled into his head as it deformed, stretching out along with his shoulders around Dylan’s v-shaped torso. As Dylan watched, he could start to see the outline of his cock showing through the back of Matt’s head.<br />
<br />
“Almost there man…” Dylan said, as he closed his eyes with pleasure. “I’m gonna come.”<br />
<br />
The flattening pouch pulled in and out as it tightened around Dylan’s rigid cock. The Lycra of the speedo was evening as it lost all dimension and took the shape of Dylan’s torso. With all the strength he had left, Matt took all of Dylan’s package in his mouth as his tounge flattened against Dylan’s sweaty testicles, merging with his Lycra pouch mouth. Matt felt the balls tighten, and then Dylan released his spunk into Matt. Matt absorbed the cum, as he did shivering one final time as his body took on the smell of Dylan’s. He was Dylan’s now. He lived only to be wrapped around Dylans’s torso, with Dylan’s cock in his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Shit,” said Dylan. “You were the best one yet. I’m gonna call you back after practice.” After collecting himself, he left the sauna and walked over to his locker to towel off before practice. He stopped to admire his new red speedo in the mirror. It was tight in all the right places, clinging perfectly to his v-shaped hips and ass, slightly looser in the crotch so his teammates wouldn’t completely see his cock through the material. The pocket his cock was resting in was so breathable and comfortable too. There really was nothing like living clothing. Dylan proudly walked out of the change rooms towards the lane pool. He would have to book Matt again some time soon.</p>
