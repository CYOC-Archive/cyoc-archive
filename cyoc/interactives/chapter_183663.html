<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the morning, Tim could feel his wife’s erection pressing against his butt cheeks. His own penis was hard as well, and leaking a bit of precum. He ate it as his wife began to stir awake.<br />
<br />
“Good morning babe,” said Tim.<br />
<br />
“Good morning,” said Mr. Tucker’s body next to him.<br />
<br />
Tim said that he would be right back. He went to cook Heather and himself breakfast in bed. Even though it wasn’t Heather who allowed him to experiment with his sexuality, Tim felt subconsciously grateful to her for it.<br />
<br />
Tim came back with a tray of food which he set down at the ottoman at the end of the bed. He wondered for a second what it would be like if Heather were aware of her current situation; being in Mr. Tucker’s body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Heather looked confused. She shot up from the bed, wearing only lace panties. Her huge cock and balls and middle aged man ass were on full display in properly fitting panties. But the look on her face wasn’t the same ass before, it was confused and concerned...had the watch given her awareness of her situation??<br />
<br />
“Tim! You fucker. I don’t know how you did this but get me out of this man’s body or I swear to god we’ll never share a bed again!! Why did you do it, perv? Was this to live out some sick little faggot fantasy? Having me be a man for an entire day and not know it!” Yelled Heather from Mr. Tucker’s body.<br />
<br />
Tim was crushed. So this is how Heather would react to being aware. He could use the power of the watch to make her unaware again. Something didn’t sit right with that option. He didn’t want to be with Heather if this is the kind of limited perspective she had. Would she really not have changed Tim for a day if she had had this kind of ability? Or was it just the fact that Tim changed her into a man that bothered her so much? Tim knew the latter was true. He was hurt and let down. <br />
<br />
“I think we need a divorce,” said Tim.<br />
<br />
“You read my mind,” said Heather, “Just put me back into my proper body.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” lied Tim.<br />
<br />
“Don’t fuck with me Tim, I’m like twice your size in this body!” She threatened.<br />
<br />
Tim got up and started to quickly leave the house. He wanted to leave Heather in Mr. Tucker’s body to teach her a lesson about what it’s like to be a man who likes men and she would see how her own bigotry hurts people. Sure, the rest of the world would still see her as a woman, despite her body being that of a middle aged Italian man, but she would always see her new body and how men would sexually interact with it.<br />
<br />
Tim was out the front door and about to pass the threshold into the lawn, when Heather grabbed dove and grabbed his ankle, knocking them both down to the ground, and screaming, “You’re not gonna leave me trapped as this fucking middle aged man!”<br />
<br />
By now the neighborhood was watching. Heather was just in her panties, though Tim was fully dressed. Her junk was flopping all around as she started to beat on her husband. The police were called shortly and the neighborhood unanimously agreed that Heather was the aggressor. When the police asked about extenuating circumstances, like if Tim had cheated on Heather, Heather went off about how Tim had put her into a man’s body and that this wasn’t her original body. They laughed and thought she was crazy, but carted her away for assault against her husband.<br />
<br />
A week later, Tim had started his new job under Mr. Tucker, who was still unaware that he was in the body of Heather. He had also met with a divorce attorney and started the process of filing.<br />
<br />
It was now the weekend, and Tim wondered what kind of trouble he could cause with the watch. He saw a young couple walking and thought to swap roles with the young woman.<br />
<br />
Instantly Tim was holding hands with the young man who was now his boyfriend. The woman whose role Tim had stolen was wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and boxer shorts. These clothes were so neutral that they didn’t stand out after the role swap.<br />
<br />
Through talking with this man that was his new boyfriend, Tim discovered that this man was 18, and that his new role was also 18. Oops, younger than Tim had reckoned from across the way. They were out of high school but about to take a skip year due to covid. His name was Ryan and he was 5’10”, skinny, with brown hair, green eyes, and some fuzz on his face. Tim thought that Ryan was cuter than he reckoned from a distance as well. <br />
<br />
“So you’ll go with me Ava?” Ryan asked about dinner with his dad.<br />
<br />
“Of course babe,” said Tim, kissing Ryan. They started making out. Ryan was a way more adventurous kisser than Heather was. This was nice, but eventually they needed to come up for air. <br />
<br />
The two love birds went off to Ryan’s house. Ryan’s parents were divorced and they didn’t hear from his mother, so the dinner was just Ava (Tim), Ryan, and Kenny. Kenny was a nice enough dad, and treated Tim well as Ryan’s girlfriend. There was just one thing. Kenny was so fucking hot. What was Tim to do?</p>
