<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike and Sei wandered over to the outside garden. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure it came from over here!&quot; Mike said as he and Sei arrived at the area.<br />
<br />
They scanned the garden. Over in his corner, Jonny prayed that the two would rescue him. He waited in silence, since that was all he could do, for the two of his brother&#39;s friends to notice him. The gargoyle in front of him was back in its original place but now it&#39;s face seemed to be carved in the middle of laughing, as if he was endlessly mocking Johnny. The thing may have been ugly but at least it could move.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that over there?&quot; Sei asked.<br />
<br />
Mike and Sei had spotted the strange figure tucked away in the corner of the garden. Mike shrugged and the two boys went to investigate. What they saw was the statue of a naked boy in front of a stone gargoyle perched in the corner of the garden. <br />
<br />
The boy was young looking, had a smooth stone bubble butt and seemed to be carved in an odd pose. In fact mike was almost a sure the statue was carved intentionally to seem as if it was trying to run away from the gargoyle.<br />
<br />
Sei suddenly started laughing. Mike looked over at him and frowned &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sri pointed to Johnny&#39;s crotch. &quot;Looks like this statue didn&#39;t get great equipment from his sculptor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike smiled and looked down, then he also broke out into laughter. The statue&#39;s junk was definitely on the smaller side. <br />
<br />
Johnny wasn&#39;t sure what to think. He was terrified and wanted to be released from his petrifi action but at the same time now he was feeling even more humiliated than ever. As if being turned to stone butt naked wasn&#39;t bad enough? He couldn&#39;t move his eyes but he could easily Sei and Mike in front of him, observing him. He tried to move his lips, or vibrate his vocal cords. He wanted to speak and demand help or at least defend himself (he was sure his dick was a sizable five to six inches) but it was no use. He was solid stone. All he could do was wait and hope.<br />
<br />
Mile was still laughing when he looked closer at the statue&#39;s face. What he saw made him begin to choke on his laughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sei asked, wiping a tear from his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Johnny!&quot; Mike said gasping in horrible surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Sei demanded. His laughter was cut short when he paid attention to the details of the face. &quot;Oh my god...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough it was Johnny. His whole body was turned away from the gargoyle, but his face and head were still looking back at it. His expression was contorted in horror and his lips and eyes looked as if they had been pleading to the very last moment of him turning into stone. Now he just looked like a scared statue boy, begging for release. Sei couldn&#39;t believe it. Everything from the smooth bubble but to the small junk which looked like clay glued on to the statue&#39;s crotch all belonged to Johnny. <br />
<br />
Mike stared at Johnny, noticing how every inch of his skin was somehow turned into stone. &quot;What do you think happened to him?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sei still couldn&#39;t fully believe it. He tapped Johnny&#39;s stomach which showed faint muscles to see if maybe Johnny was just covered in some paint and pretending. But sure enough johnny&#39;s abs were literally rock hard and Sei knew that wasn&#39;t from his small time exercising. &quot;He&#39;s been turned to stone...&quot; Sei finally said, coming to terms with it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah good job Sherlock! But how?&quot; Mike shouted.<br />
<br />
Sei shrugged, &quot;Maybe he saw Medusa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny was still there, watching and listening in stoned silence. This was not how he wanted the rescue to happen. They should be arguing about how change me back, thought Johnny, not about how I ended up this way!<br />
<br />
Mike out a finger on his chin. The medusa theory as crazy as it sounded did make sense. Jonny was posed running away and looked to be really terrified of whatever he was looking at. Maybe medusa has somehow walked out of fiction and right into reality just to mess with and petrify poor Johnny. &quot;Maybe.&quot; Mike answered Sei&#39;s proposed cause for Johnny&#39;s hard problem. &quot;But either way we need to help him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sei grimaced &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike glared at his friend. Jonny may have been annoying at times and typically got into odd kinds of trouble, but he was still a human person...or at least he was,before getting his ass statuefied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because we can&#39;t just leave him here as a human garden statue all day. Plus you know how freaked Ryan would be if we left his little brother all alone petrified in cold stone!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sei sighed, &quot;Alrigt find, but first we need find out how to un-petrify him or change him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; Mike nodded. &quot;And to do that we have to know exactly how he was turned into stone in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny inwardly cheered. Finally they were piecing it together and on the right track! But he nervously kept close attention on the gargoyle. It was still perched still and unmoving, unprovoked so far. But if for some reason old ugly stone face decided to wake up again...it may mean a tragic and stiff end to a failed rescue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well if it was medusa...&quot; Sei continued off his own crazy theory. &quot;Then we couldn&#39;t change him back anyway. Right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Mike admitted. &quot;I thought if we cut off her head everyone she petrified changes back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s this thing.&quot; Mile pulled at an odd thing in the ground. It was a rusty old screw. He stared at it in the palm of his hand the looked back at Johnny. Nothing.<br />
<br />
Johnny did try to move. Just in case by some miracle they were actually right about the strange object in the ground causing this, but no...he was still stiff and his body was still extremely heavy. He was still totally immobile, still just a sculpture, still just a Johnny statue.<br />
<br />
Mike frowned and looked at Johnny&#39;s face. What has he seen? He turned around to follow Johnny&#39;s face and noticed that Johnny had been staring directly at the gargoyle. He snapped his fingers, &quot;Of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Sei asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gargoyle. It was the gargoyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Sei repeated, not following.<br />
<br />
Mike turned to his friend, &quot;The gargoyle must&#39;ve changed Johnny to a statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sei pursed his lips, &quot;Well it is an ugly thing. Kinda looks mean too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike cycles &quot;Definitely, but how are we gonna make it change Johnny back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny knew it was over. As soon as Sei said those words he felt defeat ache in the out of his stone cold stomach. They wouldn&#39;t be allowed to go on with saying that. It looked like Johnny would be getting company.<br />
<br />
Sure enough Johnny was right. The gargoyle sprang to life and roared with anger as it grew to its full 7 font height. Mike and Sei screamed and actually grabbed each other from fear. A sight that Johnny would&#39;ve laughed at under different circumstances and providing he actually could laugh, which currently he couldn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
&quot;You dare insult me!&quot; The gargoyle sounded like a dragon hissing with rage. It spoke with an uncomfortable effect like the signs was being made from grinding stones. &quot;Now you will join your statue friend for sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
The petrifying liquid oozed out. It was two boys so the gargoyle was sure to make it a large dose. It instantly covered Mike and Sei head to foot. But they still had time to turn around and try to run away, just like Johnny had. Sei spun around and dashed to Johnny&#39;s right while Mike stumbled to Johnny&#39;s left. But the liquid took effect and it was still spurting out from the gargoyle. Their feet were encased and their legs quickly turned to stone. Some of it landed on Sei&#39;s back and butt, melting his clothes away. <br />
<br />
In an awkward move for decency, Sei turned his torso around tried to use his right arm to cover his butt. The liquid covered it turning it to stone before his very eyes and he took afraid of touching it for fear of having the liquid spread faster. Mike had his arms raised in a confusing chaotic way, as he desperately tried to shield himself from the odd statue making goo. But his arms and everything else quickly petrified, leaving him standing perfectly still, waiting for his head to harden too.<br />
<br />
Sei was in the exact same position. The liquid stopped spurting but it drizzle down their faces from the tops of their heads and continued crawling upwards onto their necks and up their chins. They were both now fully screaming in pain, horror and for help as the liquid quickly covered their faces as well, freezing then with similar looks of horror that matched Johnny&#39;s. All Johnny could do was watch and listen, as muffled gurgling and groans came from the shiny faces of Sei and Mike.<br />
<br />
Eventually the liquid hardened and changed color just like it had on the rest of their bodies, and their faces went from shimmering silvery fluids to smooth perfectly carved stone. And their sounds stopped, and they were all silent.<br />
The three boys were now all petrified, forming statues that depicted young men running from the monstrous gargoyle. Sei was awkwardly posed running away, yet turning around to cover his ass, which he failed to do as his right arm was too far to offer any real protection of coverage. Mike was hunched over and cowering, arms uselessly still in front of him, body also turned away as he tried to run. They were both now totally naked just like Johnny, their manhood was stone and smooth, and Sei and Mike at least had solace that their proud 7 inch dicks looked damn good sculpted on their groins. <br />
<br />
Johnny was the same he had been, frozen while trying to run, junk still on the &quot;smaller side.&quot; He was absolutely crushed. Everything was now still and eerily quiet in the garden. All hopes fell to Ryan now. But chances of him succeeding on his own and not being turned into a naked statue like the others were slim. The only solace Johnny had was that he wasn&#39;t alone and that Sei and Mike now experienced the same stiff immobility and torture that being turned to a stone statue actually was. <br />
<br />
The gargoyle hissed and settled back on its perch. He chuckled an evil drago like laugh that gave Johnny the wish to shiver, but he couldn&#39;t move to do so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha! Now you three are the ugly ones now!&quot; The gargoyle bragged. <br />
<br />
Mike and Sei inwardly frowned, they couldn&#39;t actually express this, as the garfoyle&#39;s definition of odd certainly was odd. Because even though they were terrified and their faces were carved to resemble this, they still knew that they both at least looked great. Sure they were ultimately humiliated at being encased in stone and stripped butt naked, but they had good looking bodies that they both worked hard on in the gym. Mike and Sei each had nice pecs and six packs which reflected perfectly in the solid stone of their bodies. And even Sei had to admit that little Johnny looked pretty good too. Smaller in every way, but cute. Still the utter defeat and awful fate the boys were facing made the gargoyle the clear winner here, despite looks of any kind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps we can be made an large sculpture together. I already know what it could be titled,&quot; the gargoyle mocked as he creaked and went still again, &quot;Three Flee the Gargoyle.&quot; With that final naming of the event so perfectly captured in sculpture, the gargoyle fell silent and totally still, staring on over his captured boys and watching for any further sign of trouble. <br />
<br />
The boys formed a sort of semi-circle around the gargoyle. If not garden decorations or boy sculptures, at the very least Mike, Sei and Johnny now served as motionless warning signs for all eternity, hinting at the danger to come to any who dared approach the gargoyle. The stiff and solid stone figures of Mike, Sei and Johnny we&#39;d left to their own thoughts now. But all of them were thinking the same thing. Someone had to save them! Or else this was it for the boys.</p>
