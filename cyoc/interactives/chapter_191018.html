<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she entered the room, she found that her room turned into a nursery at some sorts. Even though the walls stayed the same, the master bed was replaced with two cribs that have door panels on the front so it could be opened easily. Next to the cribs was a changing table with a stepping stool, which had a few sets of diapers underneath. There were also a bunch of toys that were scattered around the bedroom floor, even though there was a toy chest nearby. Megan also looked around the closet where she saw a bunch of toddler sized shirts inside. She grabbed one of them that was purple with a cartoon bear sniffing a flower and put it on.<br />
<br />
The drawer on the right side of her crib was still there, but it was still too tall for her to get the phone above. Megan then gets the stool from the changing table, where she grabbed the phone and went down to the bathroom. As she went back, Zion was a bit tangled from the toilet paper that he was playing with before. “Okay sweetie, just a couple pictures and then mommy will help you to get the toilet paper off.” She then used her camera app and took a few pictures of Zion as he was twirling a bit and waddled around the bathroom. She later posted the pictures on Instagram where she tagged a couple of her friends, along with Edward.<br />
<br />
Just as she promised, Megan immediately got the toilet paper off from Zion and she had him step on the stool where she helped him get his toothbrush and have clean his teeth with his grapefruit flavored toothpaste. He brushed them for a little while before she helped him gurgle the remaining gunk out of his mouth, as he washed it down with mouthwash made for kids and some water. “Okay, now we can have breakfast.” Zion was excited to hear this as he was still hungry. Both made it out of the bathroom where they went downstairs, and she opened the babyproof fence that guarded the stairs between the two hallways.<br />
<br />
As Zion heard a familiar sound coming from the TV, he rushed to see that one of his favorite shows, The Gigglypets, was on. The television screen then showed the main characters, which had Alanna the Purple Koala, Benny the Bunny, and Louis the Big Cuddly Hamster, who were finding the lost cake in their local town. Edward and Zion seem to enjoy the show, as it had brightly colorful visuals and easy listening music in the background. The character designs were also adorable looking and seem to be very marketable towards toddlers. <br />
After looking at the television for a short period, Megan started to make breakfast. She got the eggs and pancake mix out of the fridge, where she brought them to the stove. For a little bit, she was busy preparing the food before putting the pancake batter and eggs on top of the stove. She also put some bacon in there, since she knows that Edward might like some. During this time, she also prepared a few bottles of formula and put them in the microwave for a minute before breakfast was done. <br />
<br />
“Okay guys, breakfast is ready.” She announced to her husband and son that were currently watching the TV. They were enticed with the smell that was roaming near the kitchen. Both of them waddled happily towards the kitchen table as she carefully put the food and formula there. Since the family were all toddlers now, the highchair and other chairs were replaced with ones that they could sit on without much difficulty. It came with little holding seats so that they wouldn’t fall down as they were eating. <br />
<br />
The family was then chowing down on the food, as well as drinking some formula from their bottles. Zion was so used to drinking formula, but the creamy taste of it had Megan and Edward enjoy it so much. “Wow, I never knew that having formula was so good.” Megan kept sucking it down from the bottle. “Yeah, it tastes delicious.” Edward said as there was some formula dripping from his mouth, where as Megan used a napkin to dry it. “So you guys never had formula before?” Zion wondered as he was still drinking from his bottle. “Well no, we just didn’t had it for a while.” Megan answered back to her son. <br />
<br />
They continued to eat the delicious pancakes and eggs, with Megan helping her son cut the food with their utensils. After a while, the family was done eating breakfast and they went to watch some TV as Zion was playing with his rocking horse nearby. Megan and Edward enjoyed this sensation of being toddlers again, as Megan played with some of the toys on the floor while the TV was on. Although she was keeping up a list on what stuff she should buy, since she thinks that Zion needs a new crib. The one that she had for Zion was one that she got from one of her work friends after her daughter aged out from the crib. It was still sturdy, despite it being fairly old. It was surprising that Zion didn’t get a new crib like what her and Edward have in their newly transformed bedroom. <br />
<br />
When a commercial break came on from the Gigglypets marathon, it shown a toddler wearing a retail uniform and a diaper underneath speaking next to a warehouse background. “We know that this new change seems rather something that we never experienced before, but we’re here to help.” Megan looked at the TV screen before it transitioned to a store that was stocked with a bunch of stuff for babies, along with video games and toys for older children. “Here at the new Kids R’ Us, we’re here to help whatever you want or need.” It then pans to a bunch of children toddling around the store, looking for the stuff that they need. “We got binkies, diapers, toys, games, and everything else we need.” Zion was interested with the stuff that was shown on the screen, as he looked from sitting on the rocking horse still. <br />
<br />
“Mommy, can we go there?” Zion asked happily to her, as Megan thought it would be a good idea to get a new crib for him there. “Sure, sweetie.” She responded confidently as Zion cheered and clapped happily. “So come on down for Kids R’ Us for a fun time.” The commercial then cut to the store’s logo, which looked like a rebranded merger from both Toys R’ Us and Babies R’ Us. Megan then tried to finish her shopping list for stuff that she would buy today on her phone before toddling upstairs to get pants for the family.</p>
