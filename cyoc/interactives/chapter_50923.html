<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin did get his rematch against Jenny, ten times, on the eleventh time he had <br />
memorized her play style enough that he was able to score a win and then some there <br />
after, forcing Jenny to readjust her strategy as her character again fell off the platform off <br />
screen scoring as a win to Kevin.  After that, the four pups played in a four way free for all, <br />
with Kaylee sitting back and watching happily.  The best part was of course, of all of this, <br />
was that she'd have something to relate to with her pups. She knew that they were too <br />
young for some of the shows she had used to watch as Kyle, and now having different <br />
tastes in what was desirable she found that she didn't care as much for the shows that <br />
were based greatly on physical appeal. 'Oh well, not that a big loss, not when I've got <br />
Master waiting for me each night.' Kaylee thought. <br />
<br />
Kaylee giggled when they decided to have a three against one tournament with all the <br />
brown-red furred pups against the black furred pup Jenny and proclaimed Smash Queen. <br />
To be fair, Jenny proved as tough as nails and had quickly figured out which characters had <br />
the biggest unfair advantage. <br />
<br />
Mr. P said, &quot;I just don't get it, how can you find something like this entertaining? Books are <br />
better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it's an acquired taste.&quot; Kaylee said simply not feeling like a debate right now. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so.&quot; Mr. P. said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only for today...&quot; Kaylee responded. <br />
<br />
Mr. P this time said nothing. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Remember we work in pairs here!&quot; Cobalt shouted, &quot;We're here on our own until the glass <br />
pups come back for us so if one of us gets hurt we have to look after them, and stay out of <br />
the surf, or you're likely to get bitten by a sea snake or step on a rock fish or something <br />
else nasty lethal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Opal shouted also, &quot;If your partner is hurt and can be moved bring them back here with <br />
us! If they can't be moved call for help! If no help comes soon then come back here!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Garnet you're with Amber, find out how big this island really is!  Lazuli, you're with <br />
Amethyst, now don't give me that look!  Coral with Touramline! Ruby with Emerald! Jasper <br />
you're with Goldie and examine the animals if there are any and keep track but don't do <br />
anything stupid! Topaz and Cornelian you two scout out the plant life don't eat anything <br />
until showing it to the others!  Now let's move!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt looked at Opal, &quot;How'd I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lovely.&quot; Opal licked her cheek. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
As Garnet and Amber circled the island, Garnet began huffing and puffing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can gather this information already,&quot; Garnet said, &quot;This island's big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! I'd most decidedly say that! We're like Columbus setting foot on North America!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Columbus never technically -landed- on North-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except we don't have any indigenous people to greet us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is a GOOD thing Amber! I'd rather we didn't have to deal with nice friendly <br />
people who'd turn out to be blood thirsty cannibals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on! This island's in the middle of nowhere, if they ate each other, they'd all die <br />
out! Just like the Atlantians!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber did you stay awake through a history class in your life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I usually took another class and I had my friends do my notes for me, why do you ask?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.. never mind...&quot; <br />
<br />
Amber let it drop, &quot;It sure is beautiful here isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don't mind not having running toilets, and no refrigerator.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh don't spoil the mood Garnet, sure it's not good to not have those things, but look at <br />
this place, a natural pristine place and here we are naked and one with nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you're planning to give up sleeping under a roof and everything else related to <br />
civilization it's not 'one with nature' in the literal sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh lighten up Garnet.&quot; <br />
<br />
A sing song voice echoed through the trees, &quot;Oh the hill~ are alive with the sound of <br />
music~!&quot; <br />
<br />
They looked at each other and said, &quot;Amethyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In the People's Republic of China, the wolf pups were in a small store trying on a selection <br />
of cheongsam. Or rather, they were of the -reflections- of the cheongsam at least. <br />
<br />
&quot;So many gray suits and gray dresses, and they all look the same, how droll.&quot; Abbey <br />
commented, the hypocrisy with her mothers completely going over her head. <br />
<br />
Alice looked at her cousins/half-sisters, &quot;I think become like me has done wonders for <br />
your vocabulary as well as your writing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know! I didn't even realize it before! It's so cool!&quot; Abbey nodded happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone is crowded.&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;I'm glade that they're just all reflections, I <br />
wouldn't be able to breath in that mess.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We do not breath at all in the outside world. So that is a moot point.&quot; Alice said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, still getting used to some of this.&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Abbey suggested, &quot;Why don't we go outside and see if there's anyone who can do <br />
our hair up in here after we bring them in?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
Martha said very quick with her two heads, &quot;That would NOT be a good idea Mistress <br />
Abbey! China is... a very strict country... if we look like we don't belong, we'll get in <br />
trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's too bad.&quot; Abbey lamented ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which do you think looks better? Imperial Purple or Imperial Yellow?&quot; Samantha held up <br />
the two child sized cheongsam.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would chose the purple dress,&quot; Alice said, &quot;It adds a nice contrast to your fur cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Kay.&quot; Samantha responded.<br />
<br />
Martha thought amused on weather or not she'd have enough arms to carry all the dresses <br />
back to the manor. Or rather, the manor's reflection. 'It's strange, they're all just <br />
reflections, but they're real as far as Mistress Alice and her cousins are concerned. <br />
Incredible. It's almost a pity they can't wear them in the real world. Then again, we're all <br />
naked and free in that reality... ' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen sat down next to Kaylee as the pups played. Jensen put an arm around Kaylee, she <br />
didn't resist, after all, she had been created to be submissive to his wishes. He leaned over <br />
to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a favor to ask of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I created you from Kyle, you were made to merely submit to my wills and desires <br />
and adore me and nothing else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I DO adore you Master, and live to see you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you became more than that... you took on a life all your own... you think, you feel, <br />
you are. ... Kaylee, what I want is very simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then ask it of me Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me Master anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-master, I mean, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... I love you. You're my mate and my Alpha Female, you are not my property... &quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee looked at Jensen with eyes that grew larger and larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;And since I love you, I can't think of you as a servant... please, call me Jen', Jesen, Dear, <br />
Dearest, Hansom, Big Bad Wolf... but not Master... you're not my slave, not anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee felt something in her brain break, then with tears in her eyes she hugged him <br />
exclaiming, &quot;I LOVE YOU TOO!&quot;  The two giant wolves twisted around each other on the <br />
coach, kissing as passionately as they could with her muzzles. <br />
<br />
The pups didn't notice as they played their video game. Mr. P covered his eyes and let out <br />
a small howl. <br />
<br />
Neither Kyle nor Jennifer, or later Kaylee or Jensen had ever felt so whole as they did in <br />
that moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you still share me with the triplets?&quot; Jensen asked a bit later.<br />
<br />
&quot;They love you as much as I do M-m..dear..it would be wrong if I didn't...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, I know.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
Mary walked down the street reading War and Peace on occasion. Thinking she was a tiny <br />
bit more cultured than people who walked and text at the same time, she had only -<br />
nearly- walked into a street lamp after all. Most of her classmates thought she was <br />
bonkers for wanting to read a book that long that wasn't a class assignment, but she <br />
ignored it. 'Mark Twain said a classic was what everyone wants to have read but no one <br />
wants to read, well, here I am reading Mr. Twain.'<br />
<br />
'So many characters.. but he handles them all so well.' It was a good thing Leo Tolstory <br />
was such a good writer, otherwise  Mary thought that for the average writer with this many <br />
characters would eventually cause the story to slow down to a crawl and possible result in <br />
some characters being lost in the fold for no good reason. 'And my cousin said anime <br />
shows tended to have oversized casts.' <br />
<br />
Mary was so caught in the whitewash of the Russian winter that she took a wrong turn, <br />
then took one more wrong turn, and ended up in a neck of the neighborhood she really <br />
shouldn't have been in. <br />
<br />
That was when she bumped into the man wearing the trench coat and and big brim hat. <br />
She stepped back some and realized she was in a side road between buildings with a <br />
mural to world peace on one wall and a abstract tile mosaic on the other.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh excuse me.&quot; She said and took a step to walk around the man when he stepped in her <br />
way. <br />
<br />
&quot;M-my, a-arn't you pretty.&quot; His hands were gloved, but the way he moved suggested he <br />
wasn't exactly young.<br />
<br />
Mary remembered the pepper spray she had in her back pocket and reached one hand <br />
halfway there casually just in case however. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to be pretty too... &quot; Said the man holding his hat down. &quot;And I used to attract all <br />
sorts of pretties. I only made'em be useful.  But nobody saw it that way...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; mary put her book down and took a step back. <br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't fair after either. I served my time. They had no right. But that one stupid she-<br />
cop outside the parole board!  Long curly hair, mammies like melons, she expected <br />
anyone to take her serious?  I told her what I thought of a slut like her.. she had no right <br />
dammit! No right! Everything would have been perfect if not for her!&quot; <br />
<br />
Now Mary did grab the pepper stray in her back pocket and got ready to run right after <br />
take a few steps back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid beotch, she said I'd never do what I did ever again. She some crap about me <br />
looking like I did on the inside! Stupid beotch!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wind blew hard, the hat went off his head before he could grab it. And Mary saw it, the <br />
face of a winkled old man, with skin redder than the worst sunburn, and a pair of horns <br />
sticking out of his forehead like knifes.  <br />
<br />
Mary heard herself scream, then she sprayed the pepper spray in his face, and turned and <br />
ran. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare little beotch!&quot; <br />
<br />
He heard the monster shout. <br />
<br />
Mary felt herself trip on something and fall down, she knew there hadn't been anything in <br />
her path. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Mary said turning around for whatever reason ready to give the maniac a second <br />
spray of need be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say Dare and be my slut! Say Transform and I'll fix you good!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're the one who shouldn't be able to have kittens!&quot; Mary retorted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a bit and say nothin' and you can be both! Just wait just a little bit longer...&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary remembered, all the rumors, all the sightings, all the stories of friends of a friend... <br />
it couldn't be. But she remembered when talking with her friends once she said she'd <br />
rather be a freak then turned into some puppet!   <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;PST! You're such a beotch! Now you can be a kitty, a widdle kitty girl! A little widdle kitty <br />
girl! You can be just the right 'size' for me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The maniac retrieved his hat. Mary suddenly felt herself shrinking, or rather her clothes <br />
getting bigger. No, more than that, she saw her chest under neath her bra and blouse <br />
begin to dissolve faster than the rest of her, she felt something push between the two <br />
sides of her rear and out of her spine and it hurt! She finally had the wits to stand up in <br />
the mist of this abject insanity her skirt falling down she stood, her blouse quickly <br />
becoming a one piece dress in comparison. She felt her ears move to the corners of her <br />
head and her face push out like grabbed by some invisible hand as her body become like <br />
clay.  Her senses exploded in force as she realized just how horrible this monster stank!  <br />
Reddish gold fur began to cover her body at an alarming fate as she felt her feet mutate <br />
and warp, her bra falling useless around her ankles her shoes and shocks no longer the <br />
right shape for her feet.  she kicked them off and tried to run but trip again... this time, it <br />
was on her own tail. Her tail!  Her hair... was that HER HAIR falling OUT!? <br />
<br />
The monster took her shoulder, &quot;That right, nice and pretty, no gonna give me any trouble <br />
now are ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now feeling fear the likes of which Mary screamed, she felt something push out of her <br />
fingers, and clawed at the monster's face. He screamed, cursed and snarled. &quot;Cat-beotch! <br />
Teach you manners!&quot; <br />
<br />
Now that she had a different angle, she saw the clopping of hooves underneath his long <br />
jacket and the snakeish movements of a spade pointed tail.  He took hold of both her <br />
wrists.<br />
<br />
A black mass of something came down screaming and hissing onto his face, doing even <br />
worse than she had. He let go of her, she ran, she just ran, her blouse the only thing now <br />
covering her. <br />
<br />
The maniac -tore- the black cat away from his face and bits of flesh too and chased after <br />
her, holding onto his hat all caution or reason thrown to the winds. <br />
<br />
Mary ran, and ran until she was back along people and kept running, the monster <br />
followed, she ran across the street, the monster followed... and the bush was not able to <br />
stop in time. <br />
<br />
The black coated monster went sailing, half his bone broken on the first impact, then the <br />
rest broken on the second. He died on the way to the emergency. <br />
<br />
Mary backed away from all of this with wide eyes... everyone was concerned over the man <br />
who had just been hit by a bus, not the little girl backing away from the crowd. The fact <br />
she had fur and a tail didn't seem to register with anyone as 'wrong' let alone she was <br />
wearing a teenager's blouse as a dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay, relatively speaking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary turned and yelped, it was the black cat from the alley.<br />
<br />
&quot;You-you, you spoke?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can understand me?! I'm just meowing! I guess it must be like Trevor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind. Miss is anything broken? Are you hurt anywhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... no I... don't think so but... what just happened to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were Transformed by the Game, the curse of Glendale, heard of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it was a myth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to cold hard reality. Miss, I know this is all very confusing and horrid but... right <br />
now I... I need you. Or rather, a friend of mine does. Oh and I think this is yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cat dragged foreword a book and a small carry bag, now rather like a child's purse to <br />
Mary. <br />
<br />
Mary took the items and looked at the black cat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Judas. My human is Father Michael. I hate to say this but we really do need <br />
you. You now have the power of the game for one turn now that it's been given to you... <br />
and, we really need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was too much for Mary and she knelt down then had to side sideways a bit due to her <br />
tail poking her.  &quot;I wanna go home...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can appreciate that, but -please- a lot of innocent people are going to depend on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is why some bad TV show! You just HAPPENED to come by and help me when I run <br />
into that ... that thing for the first time in my life? The first time I run into something from <br />
this 'game?' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you? Or did you just run into something you couldn't ignore before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her current state made Mary think about a girl with a cat ears and tail that looked very <br />
reality came out of a pet store looking in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;But still! How do I know you didn't lure that man to me or something so I'd help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would be the logic in that if he had a turn and was a friend of mine, why would I <br />
ask him to change you if it was only to ask for your help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary had to admit that made some sense. <br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;So this game, how does it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judas laid it down, the five person limit, the one minute time limit, the limit of being in <br />
Glendale, and all the other research his Master had done on the game, giving the girl a <br />
very clear picture of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it cute seeing her meowing to that cat?&quot;  Said a happy couple as they passed by.<br />
<br />
&quot;What-&quot; Mary exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you speak to humans you're speaking your own language, when you speak to me <br />
you're speaking felidae.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feli-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat-speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I understand that this a lot to take in. But seriously, my friends are going to need <br />
your help! Someone has... for lack of a better word been trying to 'win' the game as it were <br />
rather than just it for petty spite like it was created for and from what I've been told has <br />
already caused a lot of damage... Please. Help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... How do I know I can trust a cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I give you my word as a Christian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're joking!&quot;<br />
<br />
Judas groaned, &quot;Why does everyone say that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I ask why you have your philosophical view of the universe? Look... my friends need <br />
you, you now have a power that encourages those who have it use it for selfish and small <br />
things... but it doesn't need to be that way. ... Now please... will you help me help my <br />
friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary sat still for several minutes, the sun feeling very odd against her fur. Finally she <br />
sighed, &quot;Fine, okay, the world's already gone mad so why don't I go all the way down the <br />
rabbit hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise there are no rabbits involved in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... never mind... can we go now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, you have no idea how much help you can be with the turn you now hold... I <br />
would never ask this of someone normally and I'd leave you be, but there is a lot at stake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you wouldn't helped me back there if I didn't have a 'turn'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have helped you anyway, that's what being a good Christian IS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my mom and dad? What are they going to say when they see me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's possible they're already redecorating your room to suit your new age and taking out <br />
your old stuffed toys and your friends will be suddenly thinking about getting you dolls <br />
rather than CeeDee's for your birthday. All depending on the game's attitude. Assuming <br />
they haven't forgotten you entirely if the game chose to just be sadistic. On the plus side it <br />
means no one is going to call for the zoo when they see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's impossible!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So is technically according to the laws of science what just happened to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Mary sighed and looked at Judas, &quot;Lead the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mary, just, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judas lead the little girl to Father  Mike's church. Mary couldn't believe how little attention <br />
people were giving her besides the idea of a girl her age not being accompanied by <br />
anyone. She had her tail stepped on twice before she realized she could conscious control <br />
it. <br />
<br />
 The Father, who Mary was surprised had a monkey's tail (and what was more surprising <br />
what that she hadn't thought about how weird it was he had a monkey's tail before). The <br />
man took one look at her, and knelt down and said, &quot;I'm here to help. Tell me how it <br />
happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to call some friends, make yourself conformable, I'll be right back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Father Mike left to the back of the church.  Mary looked at the baptismal fountain, and <br />
feeling curious suddenly, climbed up over the edge and looked down, she startled at what <br />
she saw and almost fell in. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I-I'm... &quot; She looked herself now with her head on straight, &quot;I'm a lion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would explain why you're now 'baled.'&quot; Judas said calmly coming up the other side, <br />
&quot;Only male lions have manes, and you are decidedly still a girl, and thus wouldn't logically <br />
have a 'mane' or 'hair.' Just fur.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just can believe I didn't do anything to depend myself WHILE he was playing that horrid <br />
'game.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father Mike seems to think that the game twists fate so a exchange can't be interrupted <br />
until the victim gives their answer. Of course there's no way to know for sure. And it's just <br />
possible it's just a dulling of the senses... and before you ask, I didn't think you were <br />
going to need my help until after he said the words of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary's parents had expected her to be out all day, and Mary told herself this entire mess <br />
would be cleaned up before she got home anyway so she felt no need to call them about <br />
all this yet..<br />
<br />
Father Mike returned with a pink set of overalls Mary's new size and a white t-shirt with a <br />
glitter unicorn on the front also her new size. Sadly, no shoes or socks could fit her new <br />
paws. When Mary said with stereotypical suspicion on where the clothes had come from, <br />
Father Mike said with a trace of indignation that it was from the charity donation bin.  <br />
Mary in a low voice apologized which Father Mike accepted gracefully. <br />
<br />
Naturally a hole needed to be cut for her tail, and sadly there were no undies in the <br />
donation bin, still, it felt better than going around naked.. or that was what Mary told <br />
herself as the heat of her fur and the clothes she was wearing built up. <br />
<br />
A while later a fifty year old African woman dressed like a fortune teller, a orangoutang <br />
wearing a crucifix, and a tom tabby with bandages around one beg being carried by the <br />
woman entered the church. <br />
<br />
The elder woman knelt down and looked Mary on eye level, &quot;Hello Mary... I am Madam <br />
Serenity, this is Trevor, and this is Paul, we have a lot to talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary only nodded.</p>
