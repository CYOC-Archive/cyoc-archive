<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Entering the changing room, with Brianna tugging him along, her hand firmly gripping his as she quietly giggled, Jeff could hardly believe what was going on. It was a surreal mix of two things -- first, the fact that his secret, a transformation he thought completely embarrassing and shameful, had been exposed to the girl he had a massive crush on. Second, that the very same girl was more than okay with it, to the point she was laughing and didn&#39;t seem to have a care in the world, while she took him shopping for a way to better disguise it.<br />
<br />
It made him feel very conflicting emotions, but one thing was certain -- he was becoming more and more relieved she knew. Though still flighty and a bit touchy, overall Jeff was glad, if a bit bewildered, that Brianna was being so damn cool about the way everything had played out.<br />
<br />
With the door closed, she let go his hand, folding her arms, and squinted thoughtfully. &quot;Okay, so, you only really need one cup, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; he agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then all we have to worry about is your cup size, but we can&#39;t find that out the traditional way of torso measurement around the bust, because, well ... it&#39;s between your legs instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Brianna,&quot; he coloured red, the sting of his freakdom coming roaring back, &quot;I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hey, big boy,&quot; her teasing interruption was gentle, and her grin softened, along with her voice. &quot;You&#39;re in safe hands with me. Nobody&#39;s gonna bother us here. You said you trust me, so trust me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Jeff nodded, still jumpy. &quot;So, uh, you need to ... see it? To compare?&quot; Getting brave, he reached for his pants zip, hesitating only a moment, and she nodded back, encouraging him to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Brianna&#39;s reply was simple and sweet. &quot;And I might have to ... touch a little -- if you&#39;re okay with that? Just say if it gets weird, &#39;kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Taking a deep breath, he unzipped, and slid the pants down his thighs.<br />
<br />
There it was, held in place by the ill-fitting makeshift holster he had crafted from his mom&#39;s bra.<br />
<br />
Crouching, she placed herself in front of him and came a little closer. Jeff could only watch, eyes wide, nervous but also weirdly jittery, as she examined it. He could feel her touching the edge of the cup, where it squeezed the breast-flesh a bit too tightly, some of it spilling out the side. Her finger traced up the edge, along the seam, repressing the enjoyable twinkle her light brushing of tissue and thigh sent across his nerves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering,&quot; she glanced up to make eye contact, &quot;how you pee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh ... go ... through the nipple.&quot; Brief images of his dramatic experiences relieving himself flashed through his mind from the previous weekend, and he shrugged, sheepish. &quot;It holds a lot more than I used to, um, before ... all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That has to be weird for you.&quot; It wasn&#39;t preachy or judging, just an honest thought. Looking back down, Brianna began to loosen the cup, pulling it carefully so she could remove it. The strap came free from around his waist, and she extracted the cup. Jeff felt his breast shake a moment, quivering as the pressure was released, and he shivered along with it, the uncaging motion and open air oddly pleasing to his senses. &quot;It must feel different without your penis. It&#39;s funny, I still think of you as completely a boy anyways, but this does make me wonder about something ... else.&quot; She was focused back on his crotch, seeming to be fascinated by studying it naked, close enough that he could feel her breath on the skin. &quot;Can- ... can you still play with it? Like, what happens when you get turned on? Does it- ... how do you-&quot;<br />
<br />
There was nothing but pure innocent curiosity in her voice, but before Jeff could answer, his body did it for him. The image of this beautiful girl kneeling in front of him was more than enough. With a tiny pulse, the nipple stiffened, and the breast expanded with a trembling throb, ever-so-slightly. Like a flower growing to the sun, it pushed outward in the faintest movement toward the warmth of Brianna&#39;s exhalation.<br />
<br />
Faint, but totally obvious to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; She whispered it. &quot;That was it, right? That&#39;s what happens when you- ... I mean, instead of you ... getting an erection? Oh, um,&quot; she sat back, seeming to realise just how up-close she was getting to his very-intimate part, and how intrusive her commentary on his body was. &quot;I&#39;m doing it again. Getting too personal, scaring you, and here I am just butting in with these insensitive questions-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It IS embarrassing, b-but,&quot; Jeff mumbled, his mouth dry and his head spinning, and he stammered, repeating the same words back to her again, &quot;I- ... I trust you, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I trust you too.&quot; She nodded, face lightly flushed, and her eyes took on that caring shine that made Jeff&#39;s heart skip a beat. The apologetic look eased into her normal friendly attitude. &quot;I think you&#39;re definitely a DD cup. I&#39;ll go grab you a couple of different ones to try on, see what you like, okay? I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Brianna slipped out of the changing room, and Jeff was left there, momentarily alone. He couldn&#39;t believe how CLOSE she was to him just then! Was she for real? She&#39;d basically caused him to get a &#39;hardon&#39; right in front of her face, and it hadn&#39;t fazed her in the slightest. He didn&#39;t want to forget that image, of her tilting her body in to watch, the delicious texture of her lips just inches away. How he wondered what it would be like if she had just leaned in a little more, opened her mouth, and-<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Starting in surprise, Jeff hid his shock well, downplaying the subtle swelling arousal between his thighs with a frightened mastery. Brianna was crouching again, a small selection of different bras in hand, and he ignored the excited tingling in the nipple, the way his areola was prickling hotly, wanting so badly to be touched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;m gonna fit them on you one by one. If anything stands out, tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jeff rasped, biting his lip hard, and praying that his crotch wasn&#39;t about to betray him further.<br />
<br />
The first went on with a light push, followed by a second, third, fourth, in procession. The materials felt okay, but the cut of each was different, the way they sat always a little heavy or scratchy. Jeff concentrated on the sensation of the garments on his skin, and though none of them were bad, per se, they were all just ... eh. Something was missing, or they all had a small but clear downside for whatever reason. Black, purple, dark green, navy blue -- nothing seemed to be quite right.<br />
<br />
Until the last.<br />
<br />
Brianna pressed the sixth bra over his breast, and it slotted into place perfectly and with minimum effort. A pale feminine pink with intricate frilly lace trim, the bra fit around his shape like a custom-made glove. Super soft and very comfortable, the fabric was a dream, like wearing silk, and the nipple nestled into the cup snugly, tucked in as if it belonged there. Not only that, but the support was warm and cozy all over, cradling the breast&#39;s weight so well he wanted to just close his eyes and drink in the way it kissed every square inch of his skin. Quite simply, it was made for him, and he HAD to have it in his life-- without meaning to, Jeff drew in a sharp gasp of appreciation, and at the sound, Brianna perked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like that one? It&#39;s pretty!&quot; She nodded, agreeing with his reaction. &quot;It looks great on you! Amazing quality, but it&#39;s a designer brand. See the price?&quot; Brianna held up the ticket and Jeff quailed when he saw the number.<br />
<br />
No! It was more than he had cash spare to waste on something like this. He couldn&#39;t use any type of card or his parents would certainly find out, but ... this bra- ... it was perfect! Brianna was right, the quality was amazing, and just a second&#39;s worth of knowing how it felt had given him a whole new perspective on comfort. He couldn&#39;t imagine spending even another five days trying to deal with his mom&#39;s cup. But how could he-<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just gonna guess here,&quot; she interrupted his train of thought, &quot;but you don&#39;t have enough, do you? Tell you what, we&#39;ll split the cost, and you can owe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... Brianna, I can&#39;t ask you to do that! I don&#39;t have enough money -- how can I pay you back?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you can.&quot; She smiled shyly up at him, and gave Jeff&#39;s breast the smallest, lightest squeeze through the exquisite excellence of the lacy pink bra. &quot;You can come over again soon, and give me a rematch at ping-pong.&quot;</p>
