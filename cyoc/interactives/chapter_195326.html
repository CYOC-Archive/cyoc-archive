<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">4 months had passed since the brothers’ exchange, it was 2 days past Christmas and Ethan had convinced Eric to wake up bright and early to help clear up the decorations. Eric of course protested a bit, but Ethan insisted, it would be good for his little brother to get used to waking up early again, since school would start in about a week. There wasn’t much to pack, just a bit of tinsel stuck onto the walls with tape and papier-mâché baubles and star propped onto the plastic tree; it was easier that way, fewer things for Eduardo to break.<br />
<br />
Their father had behaved himself recently, or rather people’s shopping had kept him busy making deliveries throughout winter break, and on Christmas day he had drunk himself into a stupor, taking the opportunity before he’d have to go back to work; it was the best present he could have ever given the boys. Meanwhile Ethan had bought Eric some new clothes, as a way to prepare him for the upcoming growth spurt, they were just a couple of sizes bigger but most importantly they were really new, no hand-me-downs or thrift store items.<br />
<br />
“It’s aspirational” Ethan had said, when Eric tried on the loose apparel. Eric in return, gave his big brother a handmade card and matching friendship bracelets that one of the girls in his class had showed him how to make.<br />
<br />
After getting pantsed, Eric became really popular. Eyes seemingly track him down as soon as he walks into a room and people who had never took notice before greet him like they were life long friends.<br />
<br />
Of course to keep people non-the-wiser about the brothers’ change in size, Ethan used his sewing skills, built up from mending worn out clothing over the years, to makeshift a fake penis for Eric and lemon sized testicles for himself. He even sewed an extra pair of fake balls straight into his red Speedos to prevent them from falling out. He forgoes changing into his swim gear in the locker rooms, instead choosing to wear them throughout the day, like underwear, on swim practice days. In turn, he encouraged Eric to wear a belt tightly to prevent anymore accidental reveals via getting pantsed. It appeared that their precautious steps worked to alleviate any questions from their peers.<br />
<br />
Some nights, Ethan could hear Eric moaning and groaning from outside his bedroom door, no doubt his kid brother was becoming a man. At one point Ethan had leaned his ear against that same door, he let his hand wander down his pajama pants, only to squish soft flaccid flesh.<br />
<br />
‘It doesn’t matter how tiny his dick and frame is, your little brother is more of a man, a male, than you are’ Words running through Ethan’s head would usually bother any other teenager, but it gave him an odd sense of relief.<br />
<br />
Eric really hadn’t shown much signs of any physical change, but the constant masturbation gives Ethan hope that this will all be worth it. It had been stressing him out more the longer there was no visual change and while he’s become accustomed to being ‘Limp-dick Ethan’, jerking off used to be a way for him to combat his insomnia. Now that option is pretty much gone, Ethan finds himself feeling a little irritable at times and the stress had caused acne to show up more frequently.<br />
<br />
So there he was in front of the bathroom mirror, getting ready for the day and dabbing oxy10 on a few red angry spots forming across his forehead and ever so slowly pulling off a pore strip from his nose.<br />
<br />
“Ew” Eric said, looking at the residue left on the strip.<br />
<br />
“I know” Ethan nods, “It’s kind of satisfying though”.<br />
<br />
Ethan observed his face in the mirror, was he just imagining things or did his jaw line appear sharper, stronger somehow? His cheeks also seemed to have lost some buccal fat; he could pass for a guy in his mid 20’s. He sighed as he feels more pimples had formed underneath his beard, he hadn’t been shaving or waxing during the break and was sort of letting everything grow out until he absolutely had to for the next swim event. It was winter after all, and the extra body hair did keep him just a little bit warmer.<br />
<br />
Ethan thought it to be ironic, after swearing to let himself be more vain before the exchange months ago, he started getting a bit of a flare up not long after, thankfully he’s experienced bad acne flare ups in the past and has the tools to combat it.<br />
<br />
Eric sat down on the toilet seat to pee, he lifts hefty balls up to the side and pushed the skin curtain and fat pad away into the body so that his penis head would show and the urine could come out properly.<br />
<br />
“So that’s how you do it” Ethan muttered, catching a glimpse of his little brother’s reflection in the mirror, relieving himself, from the corner of his eye.<br />
<br />
Eric let out a deep sigh “Are you mocking me?”<br />
<br />
“What? No, it’s just… when I had it I sorta let it drip down my balls”.<br />
<br />
“I miss having your dick” Eric exclaimed abruptly, shaking off the last bit of piss from the tip.<br />
<br />
‘I missed having yours too’ Ethan thought, though he kept it to himself.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The boys were cleaning up the living room and open kitchen. Ethan was pulling down the tinsels from the walls while Eric went to look for boxes to keep the decorations in, searching through the storage room under the staircase.<br />
<br />
“Ethan! Come here!” Eric beckons.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” asked Ethan, he hurried to the storage room, hitting his head on the doorframe “Ouch!”<br />
<br />
“You okay?!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, what’s up? What happened?”<br />
<br />
“Look what I found” Eric pulls up a thick photo album from one of the boxes.<br />
<br />
“I was worried you got hurt or something…”<br />
<br />
“You worry too much” Eric rolled his eyes, opening the album and flicking through it. Ethan kneels down to join him.<br />
<br />
The series of pictures adorning yellowed pages brought a pang of nostalgia and hurt to Ethan’s chest. He knew who these people were, but the smiling faces made them foreign. Ethan looked to Eric, who showed no change in expression, he was probably too young to remember what life was like before the divorce, before the arguing and drinking.<br />
<br />
Ethan wanted to look away, but he couldn’t help himself somehow, like a deer in headlights, the brothers kept going through the pages.<br />
<br />
“How old were you here?” Eric pointed at a naked photograph of Ethan at the beach. The older of the boys rubbed his chin and twirled his short beard for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
“I think… 5?” Ethan answered. He couldn’t help but stare at the image, even at that age the flaccid thing between his legs must have been a little over 2 and a half inches, it was nothing like Eric’s acorn dick.<br />
<br />
Eric snapped the book shut. Startling Ethan, he turns his gaze to his little brother. Eric looks back at him sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Sorry” Eric said quietly “It’s just… it’s…bigger than…” his voice quivers.<br />
<br />
Ethan places a hand on Eric’s shoulder “Don’t give up I’m sure it’ll happen soon”. He said before getting up and turning to leave; He hits his head on the doorframe yet again.<br />
<br />
Eric scoffs “Seems to me like you’re the one going through puberty…” his voice trailed off.<br />
<br />
The two brothers quickly looked at each other.<br />
<br />
Instinctively Ethan closes the storage room door and pulls down his pants; Eric gets up on his feet and does the same.<br />
<br />
“Does it look any different to you?” Ethan asked, lifting his schlong left right and all over the place.<br />
<br />
“I..I.. I don’t know! I just thought it looked bigger every time I saw it ‘cause…I… I was jealous” Eric stammered “You’re the one it’s on, didn’t you notice anything?!”<br />
<br />
Both of them went from looking at Ethan’s junk to Eric’s and back and forth. There was definitely no change in Eric, but they couldn’t be sure with Ethan’s package.<br />
<br />
“My room, now” Ethan demanded.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
They had practically sprinted to Ethan’s room; Eric locked the door while Ethan went through his tool box looking for his trusty measuring tape. He held the tape to the top of his head and let it roll down.<br />
<br />
“What does it say?” Ethan asked.<br />
<br />
“You’re like 6’4 now!” Eric gasped.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s eyebrows went up, how did he not connect the dots? He was taller, clumsier, his jaw was more defined and he had pimples popping up across his face. Those were classic signs. Ethan walked over to his full length mirror and stepped out of his pants. He lifted his dick and cupped the testicles underneath. Now that he took a much closer look, the balls were the size of small chicken eggs, they did appear to have grown but so did his hands and the rest of his body, which might have explained how clueless he was to the changes.<br />
<br />
Ethan measured his flaccid cock, length wise it was about 7 inches and the girth had grown to 6 inches, knowing he used to be a grower, Ethan could only imagine how big he’d be if he could get hard. He had experienced the growth spurt that Eric would have gone through had he kept his testicles.<br />
<br />
“Was this your plan all along?!” Eric yelled with clenched fists.<br />
<br />
“N... No!” Ethan stated “How could I have known?”<br />
<br />
“You’re the one who bought the ring!” Eric glared at his older brother in fury “You just HAD to be the biggest guy!” He stepped forward and started hitting his brother’s abs “Give it back, give me my growth back!”<br />
<br />
“Eric stop… Stop!” Ethan grabbed his little brother’s wrists and kneeled down so that they were eye level.<br />
<br />
“I trusted you!” Eric cried.<br />
<br />
“I’ll fix this, I swear I’ll fix this!”<br />
<br />
“How?!”<br />
<br />
Ethan paused for a bit, before getting up and looking through his toolbox once more. He fished out the magic ring and put it on.<br />
<br />
“Give me your shirt and put that on” Ethan ordered, one hand outstretched and the other pointing to his pants lying on the floor. Eric still sobbing took a minute but complied. Ethan put the boy’s shirt over his head and let it rest around his shoulders like a scarf. Eric was struggling to keep the pants on, so Ethan took off his friendship bracelet and tied it to his little brother&#39;s free wrist.<br />
<br />
‘Maybe I could transfer percentages of body parts?’ Ethan thought, he focused on his little brother’s tiny penis and repeated a line in his head ‘Transfer 50% of my physique to Eric’. Alas nothing happened ‘I guess that’s just not how it works’. Ethan sighed which made Eric stop crying, his eyes suddenly filled with heated determination.<br />
<br />
Eric snatched the ring from Ethan’s hand and wore it himself. Before Ethan could react the brothers felt that very familiar warm feeling invading their crotches. Eric had switched their packages, he now had the 7 inch monster and small chicken egg balls, whereas Ethan carried large lemon sack testicles under an acorn, hidden behind fleshy curtains.<br />
<br />
“Eric, I…” Ethan was about to tell him that his monster cock had become impotent but stopped himself when he saw it rising and thickening. ‘See?’ his intrusive thoughts crept in ‘Your little brother is a REAL MAN’.<br />
<br />
“I’m taking this!” Eric exclaimed, brows furrowed, fists clenched and legs apart in some sort of power stance.<br />
<br />
“Yes”.<br />
<br />
“Did you hear me? I’m… Wait… What?” Eric’s angry expression morphed to that of bewilderment.<br />
<br />
“Take it” Ethan continued “It’s… yours”.<br />
<br />
“You mean… You’re not mad?”<br />
<br />
“Ha… Mad? Don’t be silly, I fucked up in the first place” Ethan grabbed his crotch “I deserve this”.<br />
<br />
Eric may seem to have calmed down, but one could not say the same about his appendage, the massive dick kept growing and when it stopped, both boys could not take their eyes away from it. Picking up the measuring tape, Ethan kneeled in front of Eric. This was a strangely familiar scene and it was messed up that it was with his little brother but when would he ever get a chance like this again?<br />
<br />
“May I?” Ethan asked, holding the tape up and looking intently into his younger brother’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“… Sure”.<br />
<br />
The gigantic dong twitched as Ethan gingerly lifted it up with two fingers at first and then tried to wrap his hand around it. The tips of his fingers could no longer meet this truly was no longer his cock. Ethan laid the tape across the length of Eric’s meat and his eyes almost bulged out of his head.<br />
<br />
“It’s 14 inches”.<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…”<br />
<br />
The teenager proceeded to wrap the measuring tape around the thickest part of the humongous penis and his jaw dropped, this shouldn’t be humanly possible, but there it was right in front of his face.<br />
<br />
“It’s 9.5 inches wide” Ethan slumped back, eyes locked onto the monster, mouth drooling. He thought back to that moment 4 months ago when he had his lips around the tip, right in this very room. He couldn’t get hard back then, but it is erect now and he wondered what else had changed? Did it still taste salty all around except for the sweet piss slit? Would it still be possible to get all of it in his mouth?<br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for?” Eric asked, snapping Ethan out of his trance.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“… Suck it”<br />
<br />
“Ah… N… No!” Ethan fell backwards, propped up by his palms.<br />
<br />
“You looked like you wanted to, was I wrong?”<br />
<br />
“You’re my brother! I can’t!”<br />
<br />
“You’re right…” Eric’s eyes shifted to the left for a second “But we should jerk off together”.<br />
<br />
“What are you even saying?!”<br />
<br />
“You jizzed in front of me, it’s only fair!” Eric exclaimed, calling back to the night they initially switched back “Besides” He added “You’re hard right now”.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked down at his crotch and surely enough, there was an erect thin, tiny penis poking out. It had been such a long time since he’s been able to get hard, he could feel the pent up tension within his balls; he needed to cum soon. He took a moment to breathe.<br />
<br />
“Okay” Ethan pinched two fingers between his tiny dick “I owe you, but… just this once”.<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and eagerly clamped both hands onto his colossal schlong. He looked ridiculous, a caricature of a boy. He still had scrawny limbs and was only 4’6, but that thing between his legs would be the envy of any full-grown man.<br />
<br />
Ethan watched as his kid brother stroked the big man meat, ‘It really was wasted on me’ Ethan pondered as he too began twirling his own pathetic dicklet between two fingers ‘I took it for granted, I never really appreciated it, didn’t even notice when things were changing. I deserved this, I should be devastated…’ It came and it came quick, Ethan shut his eyes tight and collapsed to the floor as geysers of cum shot out of the tiny spigot, his fully developed testicles providing more than he bargained for, it was ecstasy. Ethan’s legs spread out and his back pressed against the soiled carpet as he kept on relentlessly shooting, bathing himself in a puddle of sweat and cum ‘I should be devastated, but I’m so happy right now!’ <br />
<br />
Eric kept stroking as he observed his older brother lying on the floor panting in a mess of his own making. There had not been a time when he saw Ethan as anything other than a man’s man. He was smart and had a good charming personality to match his incredibly masculine physique. Now here was the man he respected all his life, at his feet, cumming profusely out of a pathetic dick that is literally smaller than a 5 year old; according to the picture they found in the storage room. It was a sad sight, but if that blithe look on Ethan’s face was any indication, he was content.<br />
<br />
It brought out something within Eric that he never knew was in him and he wanted to see how far he could push it.<br />
<br />
Eric approached his brother and stood over Ethan’s body. The teenager was still shooting a bit of cum and it hit Eric’s calves, drizzling down to the ankles. Eric towered his massive cock above Ethan’s face.<br />
<br />
“Last chance” Eric proclaimed. Slowly stroking up and down the shaft with one hand, and using the palm of the other to rub against the massive cock head. Ethan stared blankly as a pearl of precum seeped out from the slit and dropped down to the middle of his face. The smell, the heat, the tension was insane, but he couldn’t do it. He practically raised his little brother as if he was his own son and he just couldn’t cross that line, not any more than they already had.<br />
<br />
Seeing Ethan’s pleading face, Eric came back to his senses and ejaculated as he walked to the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
“I…I’m sorry!” Eric said in a panic.<br />
<br />
“Eric, it’s okay” though exhausted, Ethan managed to sit up on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me…”<br />
<br />
“Nothing’s wrong, this… This whole thing isn’t exactly normal to begin with”.<br />
<br />
“I’ll give you back your-“<br />
<br />
“No”.<br />
<br />
“No?”<br />
<br />
“No, Eric… I was serious. You keep it, it’s yours now”.<br />
<br />
Eric’s eyes lit up like he was the luckiest boy in the world. He then lifted up his hand with the ring on it.<br />
<br />
“No take backs?” Eric asked.<br />
<br />
“No take backs” Ethan chuckled.<br />
<br />
Eric ran to his brother and tried to give him a hug, but incidentally his still hard gigantean schlong reached him first and slapped him straight across the face, pushing him back onto the floor. Eric covered his mouth with both hands as Ethan lay frazzled for a few minutes before speaking.<br />
<br />
“We still have to pack up those Christmas decorations…”</p>
