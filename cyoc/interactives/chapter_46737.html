<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Forgetting that the light works so that only the user realizes that any changes have taken place, you return to your room, hide the light so that your little brother, now your little sister, cannot find it again and go back to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning you wake up, wondering if the whole gender changing flashlight thing was part of strange dream. Absent mindedly, you reach a hand under your tank top to rub your breasts, the cool air of your room making your nipples poke up against the thin fabric.<br />
<br />
Dismissing it all as an odd dream, which you blame on your difficulties at finding any really well fitting clothing at the mall yesterday, you decide to get dressed. As you walk across your room to your dresser, you take off the tank top, your breasts moving with each step you take.<br />
<br />
First things first, you find a bra and put it on, struggling to adjust the shoulder straps to fit more comfortably. Of course, there is only so much that you can do, since you have yet to find a bra that actually fits across your wide chest and broad shoulders. Next you find a clean pair of boxers and a pair of blue jeans and put them on. Lastly, you get a gray t-shirt and put it on, frowning at the way it falls over your breasts.<br />
<br />
Though you are not entirely upset at having breasts, you do have to admit that they make it hard to find clothing that fits you right.<br />
<br />
You hear footsteps hurrying down the hall towards your hall and you turn, expecting to see your little brother, coming to pester you about playing pokemon with him. Instead you see a little girl, her long hair messy as though she had just gotten out of bed.<br />
<br />
It takes you a moment to realize that the little girl used to be your brother, that you had changed him the previous night because he was pestering you. She stares at you, her eyes wide, finally she speaks, looking very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is your chest all funny looking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unaware that she had used the light on you during the night, you roll your eyes, &quot;Very funny, now leave me alone for a bit and I'll play pokemon with you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
You want to have a bit of time to think about if you do want to use the light more, and playing pokemon later is a small price to pay for the time alone.<br />
<br />
She continues to stare at your chest, making you uncomfortable, but she nods, &quot;Okay, but because you were mean to me you can't use my legendary or shiny cards. And why are you wearing a shirt that makes your chest look all lumpy, I really want to know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit pestering me or I won't play with you,&quot; crossing your arms under your breasts you frown at her until she leaves.<br />
<br />
Once she is out of your room, you sit down to think about her strange comments. It was like she had forgotten that you had breasts since before she was even born. For a second you fear that she might have used the light on you, but you dismiss it as nonsense, you are sure you would know if you had not had breasts last night, and your memories of them go too far back and are too detailed to be fake or some sort of mind trick.<br />
<br />
You can remember back when your breasts first started budding. You were an early bloomer and when you were ten, what was happening was noticeable. By the time your parents took you to the doctor's your nipples had already grown larger and darker, and were getting sensitive. The doctor recognized it right away as being nothing more than normal, healthy breast development. He had said that it was a bit unusual for it to happen in a boy so young, but that you might be able to get hormone treatments to delay further growth until you were a bit older if your parents feared it would get you unwanted attention. They declined and from there everything had progressed as normal.<br />
<br />
At first you thought little of it, the way your nipples would poke up against your shirts was annoying as was the way your chest would get a bit tender from time to time, but you dealt with it. There was little growth from that point on, by the time you were sixteen they were hardly an a-cup and you had no reason to even think about wearing bras. Like most of the boys your age, you were very interested in girls and their breasts, and from time to time, when you were alone in your room, you would play with them, as little as they were. It was a disappointment to discover that unlike the imaginings of your peers they were not super sensitive and touching them, even playing with your nipples was not an intense, mindblowing rush of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Then puberty hit and it hit hard, like the rest of the guys you got taller, your voice began to break and your body hair began to grow in greater profusion. In addition to that, you breasts began to grow at a much quicker rate, which was no fun at all. They were constantly tender and the way they bounced when you ran gave you a lot of trouble when you went out for sports. Your mother came to the rescue, buying you your first sports bra, which was a real lifesaver.<br />
<br />
By the time you were seventeen you were a full a-cup and still growing. This growth continued for just over a year, finally stopping when you were a full b-cup.<br />
<br />
With such detailed memories, you are certain that the light could have not been used on you, though the thought does have you wondering about what you could do to yourself with it.<br />
<br />
Your first thought it to use it to make your breasts vanish, leaving you with a normal, masculine chest, but you decide against it, for the time being at least. After having breasts for so long, you feel that to have their familiar weight suddenly gone would be uncomfortable. Instead you begin to think of its power to alter reality as it works its changes. You do like having breasts, but you have wondered what it would be like to be able to wear something that shows them off, like what you did to Gene at the mall yesterday, though perhaps not as extreme.<br />
<br />
Taking the light from where you hid it, you check to make sure your door is locked, then you pull your shirt off, toss it on your bed, unclasp your bra and set the light to a medium pink setting. A quick check and you see that the light neither enlarges nor shrinks your breasts at this setting, then you sweep it over your shoulders, feeling them narrow.<br />
<br />
Something catches your eye and you stop for a moment to look around your room. A mirror had appeared over your dresser, and you move closer to it to get a better look at yourself.<br />
<br />
What you see makes you frown, with narrow shoulders and b-cup breasts, your hairy, muscular, masculine arms look ridiculous. The light quickly fixes that, turning your arms slender and feminine. Looking at your delicate little hands you see that your nails are done in what you recognize as being a French manicure, though before this moment you are sure that you never knew of such things. All in all, it is an improvement, but not much of one. Your stomach, though you were always proud of your washboard abs, does not really fit with your new look, and you want to be sure that you can wear shirts that actually look good on you. Figuring it to be a small sacrifice, you shine the light on your stomach, then use the mirror to sweep it across your back, just to be sure that you are not missing anything.<br />
<br />
Now when you look in the mirror you like what you see slightly better, your lower body is still the same as ever, but your upper body it a gorgeous female torso. The problem you see now is your face, you obviously need a shave and to see your head, the same as ever on such a lovely body looks quite comical.<br />
<br />
Figuring that if you have come this far, you might as well take things a step further, you close your eyes and shine the light on your neck and head. You can actually feel your hair growing, stopping when it reaches the middle of your back.<br />
<br />
When you open your eyes, you smile at what you see, a gorgeous brunette is staring back at you, soft features, full lips and lush eyelashes. Pushing your hair back you see that you have pierced ears.<br />
<br />
Then you look down at your dresser any your eyes go wide. You have an assortment of brushes, combs and haircare products, as well as various kinds of makeup, all of which you somehow know how to apply perfectly, and what looks like a jewelry box.<br />
<br />
Curious, you open it up and find that it is indeed a jewelry box. This fascinates you, and you pick out a simple pair of small gold hoop earrings and put them through the holes in your ears. You like what you see in the mirror and you decide to put on a necklace and bracelet, a simple gold chain around your neck, with a stylized gold heart on it to hang down above your breasts, the bracelet is a charm bracelet, and you somehow know that each charm has a special meaning to you, that you first started collecting those charms back in high school.<br />
<br />
Then you turn back to your bed, and instead of seeing the gray t-shirt you threw there, you see a pink blouse. Quickly you put it on and admire the low cut neckline, not too low, but just enough to tease.<br />
<br />
For a time you amuse yourself by looking through your closet, looking at all of the blouses you now own, but then you start to feel that you can do better. Though the pants you now own are all slightly more stylish than your old taste in clothing, you feel that having a masculine lower body really does not suit such a gorgeous female upper body.<br />
<br />
Knowing what you want to do, you strip off your pants and boxers. Sitting down on your bed, you start at your feet, watching as they grow smaller. You see at least half a dozen shoes of all different styles appear in your closet. Then you bring the light further up, watching as the hair on your legs thins as your legs grow slender. At your hips and thighs you take things very slowly, wanting wide hips and proper curves, but not wanting to risk your manhood in the process. using your hand to shield your manhood you bring the light as close to it as you dare, the coarse hair around it thinning slightly.<br />
<br />
Then, smiling wickedly, you stand up and decide to add a finishing touch. Switching the light to its strongest blue setting you shine it on your cock and balls, watching them increase in size until your cock is seven inches long, flaccid, with a girth to match and your balls have grown to a size proportionate to such a member.<br />
<br />
The mirror that was once over your dresser has moved to the wall next to it, and grown to a full length mirror, allowing you to look yourself over from head to toe.<br />
<br />
What you see you like very much, a perfect female body, with your thickly veined member hanging down, surrounded by a triangle of this pubic hair. Other than your cock and balls you are a perfect woman.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, you pick up your boxers, which have become briefs, and slip them on. Getting them to sit comfortably on your wide hips is a bit of a challenge, but you manage, then you put on a pair of tight fitting pants that leave nothing to the imagination. it is a bit uncomfortable to cram your massive endowments into pants designed for a woman, but you like what you see, not only do they show off your sexy body, the bulge in the crotch leaves no doubt that you are still a man where it counts.<br />
<br />
At last satisfied, you look around your room, marveling at what you see. it is far cleaner, you closet is full of very stylish clothing, but at the same time there are many familiar items. You laptop is on your desk, the same as ever, as are all of the books you like to read, your taste in literature unchanged by your new body, all of the books are either hard science fiction or alternate history. Your television, X-Box360 and videogames are all still there, the same as ever, first person shooters and numerous Call of Duty titles.<br />
<br />
Aside from the clothing in your closet and the makeup and jewelry on your dresser, your room is more like a typical guy's room than a typical girl's room.<br />
<br />
Done for now with your changes, you try to decide what to do next.</p>
