<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He knew from the moment he heard about the ring&#39;s powers who he wanted to become. There was a man he would always pass on the streets who seemed like the happiest person on the face of the earth. While not a herculean figure of masculinity, he had his own style about him. His clothes were always fashionable, he had a sharp face, he was just overall attractive. He would always see him at a local cafe having a coffee with another guy and just look thrilled to bits. As soon as the person bought the ring, he knew that he wanted to live this guy&#39;s life. He knew the man was gay, hell, everyone knew it, but he didn&#39;t care. He just wanted to know what it was like to BE him, be as attractive as him, get as much attention from anyone as him. His plan was simple, go to the cafe and use the ring on the man while he&#39;s having coffee. They&#39;ll occupy the same body but neither of them will be any the wise.<br />
<br />
The next morning, he got up and went to the cafe. There was the man. Sitting with an equally as attractive man. He stared him directly in his eyes and said &quot;Assimilate&quot;. Nothing happened at first. Figures. The ring was a shame, but then he felt a churning in his gut. Quickly, he rushed to the restroom and locked the door. It felt like everything in his body was on fire. He stripped down and watched as his body changed shape. His thick layer of fat completely melted away, leaving behind a lithe body. All the hair on his body came off in clumps, leaving behind a nice smooth surface that showed a little muscle. His skin tone darkened a few shades to give him an East Asian sort of skin tone. He looked in the mirror and looked at it confused. Was that him? He couldn&#39;t recognize anything. A tugging in his crotch pulled his attention there. He looked as his previously four inch penis extended to a nice 7 inches, and his testicles swelled to boot. Staring at himself in the mirror only made it harder. Surely his old self wasn&#39;t gay, but he couldn&#39;t help but to stare in desire at what his body was becoming. He couldn&#39;t help it anymore, and he jerked off, looking in the mirror. His old memories were there, but they were fading fast. He just wanted to cum once before the transformation was over and he forgot who he used to be, and his new self came back into being. Piercings started to come into existence, two in his left ear, one under his lip, and both of his nipples. He couldn&#39;t help but play with them as he drew closer and closer. A tramp stamp drew itself on his back, and it felt amazing. His hair shaved itself on the sides, and grew longer on top, turning from a brown to a jet black. It thickened up, covering his previously embarrassing premature bald spot. Finally, his face reshaped itself as he came, and the physical transformation was over. Staring back at him was the same person who was only seconds outside on a date.... Person... C... Cameron? Yeah. That was his name, Cameron. Everything was coming back as his old memories finally disappeared into the wind with his old body. Did he really just forget his own name? Also, did he really need to strip down and jerk off right in the bathroom, when he knew for a fact that he was going to get plowed by the guy outside later? Oh well. It didn&#39;t matter. He put on his clothes, and went back outside. While walking out, remembered his entire life story. Being raised by a single mother, having numerous step dads, trying to come to terms with his sexuality in a strict household, going to Japan to visit family... Basic stuff, pretty much. He wasn&#39;t sure why he was remembering it there, though. Finally, got back to his table, and sat down across from a gorgeous blond guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, Needed to fix my hair.&quot; Cameron giggled sitting across from the guy... His boyfriend, Lance. He&#39;d been with him for the past three years, and in those years he&#39;s been the single greatest person he had ever met. No wonder he was in love with him. Lance kissed him, and ruffled his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looked great.&quot; He joked. Then he eyed the ring. &quot;Nice ring, babe.&quot; He said, taking his hand lightly. Cameron looked at it for a second, then remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, it&#39;s supposed to let you control bodies or something stupid. I don&#39;t really buy into it. It&#39;s really pretty, though.&quot; He showed off the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. It is really pretty, just like you.&quot; Lance flirted, and Cameron was putty in his arms. <br />
<br />
Yeah, He had a good life.</p>
