<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both men readied and stretched right in front of Rebecca, giving her quite the astonishing view of both bodies - of Stepp&#39;s rippling young muscular physique and Zach&#39;s somewhat more aged bodybuilder physique. She found herself staring and needing to look down at the ground to keep herself from being too obvious. She watched as Zach looked at Stepp and smirked, &quot;You ready to go, pretty boy?&quot; He&#39;d pretty much finished his stretching, and Stepp looked back over with a matching arrogant smile;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, and glad to hear you think I&#39;m pretty.&quot; He ran a hand through his hair and Zach rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
The first weight they were going to do was going to be 315, basically a starter to see where the strength levels were right there. For Rebecca it was a very heavy weight, and she could not imagine herself lifting that much. Yet she watched as the men assumed position and got ready to go.<br />
<br />
The first set between the two was an astonishing match, and she saw Stepp very easily kept a pace with Zach, whose muscular size and skill was easily coming into play. Rebecca watched the muscles pulse and flex and pump as they got to 10 reps, making Rebecca wonder what she&#39;d signed on to watch. She looked between the two of them as they looked over at one another.<br />
<br />
A wordless agreement; this weight wasn&#39;t enough to settle it.<br />
<br />
Stepp advocated, &quot;Three Hundred and Sixty Five!&quot;<br />
<br />
And Zach for his part immediately nodded, traps flaring and sweat crowning his muscular body in a glorious sheen, &quot;Oh yeah, definitely. Let&#39;s see how well you do this time!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that the next set began, both men by now sweating rivers and jaws clamped tight as they hit their set. Rebecca almost lost track of time watching as Stepp and Zach engaged in their competition. It was...it was almost like sex in a way. Watching their rippling muscles and powerful forms, straining as they pumped their hips into the weight as it went up and down...<br />
<br />
She had well and truly lost track of time by the time they settled on a new weight, this time going all the way to 405. Rebecca found herself thinking, this was probably it. Whoever won out at this huge weight was probably going to be the one to decisively &quot;win&quot;. And for all that she saw this as Zach&#39;s battle, she decided to intervene as best she could...well, that and she wanted to see what would happen. She did feel a spark of attraction - both to Zach and to Stepp.<br />
<br />
Her fantasy now was having both of them in one bed, fooling around with each other and her.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even think twice as she unleashed her power of age upon Stepp as he underwent his set alongside Zach. And if anything, Rebecca&#39;s interest in Stepp was more than rewarded;<br />
<br />
Stepp aged as he went through the exercise right there alongside Zach, his whole body almost seeming to tremble and then bulk and shred in sudden, incredible amounts, at varying points he took to looking more like a mass monstrosity before suddenly toning up, every bounce of the weight on the ground seeming to change Stepp. His biceps swelled well over the range of eighteen inches, becoming around 22 inches in size and scope, assisted in size by the tricep. Shoulders broadened and strengthened, complimented by a huge, wide and strong back, lats pushing out. His legs exploded with size, resembling tree trunks that almost tore his gym shorts asunder.<br />
<br />
His chest and traps were so large his shirt almost lost the battle with him entirely, and even though it stayed on, it was so tight Rebecca swore she could see his abs right through it, which seemed to evolve into a turtle shell shaped form identified by many as coming with steroid use. His neck became brawny and strong, jawline turning thicker and meatier.<br />
<br />
He however was so into the moment he hardly even noticed his change or more importantly, how he aged.<br />
<br />
Stepp&#39;s face and body underwent the rigors of age surprisingly well, his handsome face still remaining attractive, though not quite so boyish. His face more resembled that of a handsome older man, replete with a somewhat receded hairline and light wrinkles on his face. Even his body&#39;s skin looked more weathered and scarred and tough from the effects of age. Never would he be as soft or smooth again. His hair being blond naturally hid the emergence of gray hairs well.<br />
<br />
Rebecca realized she should stop, and did so - leaving Stepp at the age of 47. And indeed, while aging gave him a sort of strength in the heat of the moment from the tremendous muscles he gained, he did lose something in the form of stamina.<br />
<br />
As a result, Stepp only completed 10 reps before having to stop, whereas Zach completed 12.<br />
<br />
Even so, Stepp was nothing if not a genial loser, chuckling outloud and fistbumping Zach once the weights were down, &quot;Damn, man, and here I thought I had it for ah, for certain.&quot; He tried to clear his throat and sighed, hoping he wasn&#39;t coming down with something. Somehow it seemed Stepp had not noticed yet that something had happened to him.<br />
<br />
Zach responded, &quot;Yeah, you were a tough one, Stepp. Great match, and damn but you&#39;re in great shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepp stretched a bit and felt an ache in his back and sighed, &quot;I&#39;m...gonna head off and foam roll. Hope we can do that again sometime soon, Zach!&quot; And with that Stepp walked off.<br />
<br />
Rebecca for her part wondered if she changed him a little too much, but figured he was doing good enough with this, and besides, he was huge now, and looked just as good if in a different way. She looked at Zach, who seemed to be realizing what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did something---? Wow, I guess what happened to me happened to him now. What a weird thing...&quot; He looked back at Rebecca, feeling rather concerned for Stepp, but not wanting to come off as weird or crazy if he pointed that out now too. He crossed his arms, &quot;We gotta find out what&#39;s causing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the two of them headed off...</p>
