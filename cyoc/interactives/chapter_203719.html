<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rusty, RK and Tex stood in the warehouse, surrounded by various sex dolls. They’d gone over their plans ad nauseum, but RK would keep interrupting them, telling them it wouldn’t work.<br />
<br />
“Look, this guy is a wild card.” RK explained. “He’s either a bored office worker with a mean streak or a murderous cartel leader with a twisted sense of humor. He can turn himself into a dragon and cast spells from above and we wouldn’t even know.”<br />
<br />
“Not even going to talk about Arcane?”<br />
<br />
“Our timeline’s Arcane is a woman.” RK said. “She might target us, but she’s hunting Time right now for personal reasons.”<br />
<br />
“Her Book has spells that solve most of our problems.” Rusty said. “Can we contact her? Make her an offer?”<br />
<br />
“No.” RK said flatly.<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“Like I explained to Troy-.”<br />
<br />
“Who?” Rusty asked and pointed at Troy, who trotted up to them when he heard his name, tongue lolling happily. “The dog?”<br />
<br />
Tex and RK glanced at each other.<br />
<br />
“Was that a significant glance?” Rusty demanded. “Did you two just share a significant glance? Did…oh shit, is that a person?”<br />
<br />
“Erm…” Tex refused to look at Rusty.<br />
<br />
“Are you shitting me? I was rubbing his belly and he got a boner and I shook it off as a dog thing.” Rusty’s voice rose. “Who-”<br />
<br />
“Your boyfriend. He’s your former boyfriend.” RK said. “We’re really sorry but you don’t remember him anyways, so what’s it matter?”<br />
<br />
Rusty growled. “YOU TURNED MY BOYFRIEND INTO A DOG?!”<br />
<br />
“We’re really sorry.” Tex said.<br />
<br />
“How can you even get angry over something you don’t even remember?” RK muttered.<br />
<br />
“Because I was hit by Paradox, moron!” Rusty shouted. “I know how it feels! This is horrible! You aren’t planning on leaving him like that, right?”<br />
<br />
“It’s…complicated.” Tex sighed. “He was the owner of the Book of Beast.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, he was the bad guy.” Rusty deflated.<br />
<br />
“No. He saved the town, killed Transmutation.” RK shrugged. “He was just kinda uninterested in collateral damage or cleaning it up, so we punished him.”<br />
<br />
“It’s unethical. Immoral. This is not how we do things.” Rusty snarled. “Turn him back.”<br />
<br />
“We can’t.” Tex said sadly. “At least, not how he used to be. Taking people out of reality is easy. We can bring him back, make him Daryl’s new farmhand and our part-time security guard. Daryl will probably make a move on him but at least the relationship will happen naturally. That’s the easiest to do without provoking Paradox. But…”<br />
<br />
“He won’t be the same Troy as before.” Rusty grimaced. “Do it.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“At least he’ll be a happy person and not a happy dog.” Rusty shrugged. “And if he beat Transmutation, we could really use his input here.”<br />
<br />
“He is, as they say in the police shows, a loose cannon.” RK objected. “Also, he keeps turning me into a skunk.”<br />
<br />
Rusty eyed him. “To be fair, you would make a cute skunk.”<br />
<br />
RK shifted uncomfortably. “Stop talking.”<br />
<br />
Tex shoo’d Troy into the office and pointed at him. “Half.”<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Troy-if that was his name-was pulling weeds in Daryl’s backyard garden. His back had started to ache. He stood and stretched his thick muscles and rolled his head on his shoulders. Sweat glistened and slicked his short fur coat. The rottweiler felt a twinge of pain on his forehead and gingerly rubbed the wound.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, keep it up big guy!” Daryl was sitting on his porch, beer in hand, watching him. <br />
<br />
The hog was a rather handsome specimen of his species, thickly marbled in fat and muscle, bearded, piebald coloration to his hide. His eyes were a pretty blue color that made Troy’s heart do little flips in his chest whenever Daryl looked at him the way he was doing right now. His camo shorts were tented.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled at his….friend happily. He adjusted his jockstrap-a camo thing Daryl had worn when he was younger-around his own straining erection and straightened his flat topped military cap, and resumed weeding, his glorious Rottweiler ass waving in the air. He heard a happy snort behind him, knowing the hog was enjoying what he saw and smelled.<br />
<br />
Two days ago, Daryl had found him naked and shivering with a head wound on his front lawn. No idea how he got there and no memory of who he was, except for the spiked collar around his neck that had Troy’s name and Daryl’s name, address and phone number. He’d read it a million times. Troy: Property of Daryl.<br />
<br />
Daryl had figured someone had robbed him and dumped him right after he’d gotten the treatment. He’d told Troy to ignore the property part, that was weird slave shit, apparently reality became malleable right after the treatment. He was a dog….so, dogs needed owners. Troy tried hard not to question the logic, it made his scar hurt.<br />
<br />
Troy finished weeding fifteen minutes later. He rubbed his hands together to clean the dirt off and then sauntered happily over to Daryl, grinning.<br />
<br />
“Good boy!” Daryl grinned lewdly, eyeing Troy’s erection as it jumped at those words and licking his lips. “Wanna beer or somethin’? It’s 90 degrees out.”<br />
<br />
Troy reached down and gently took the half-drank bottle from Daryl’s hands and drained it. Daryl smiled, tiny stubs of tusks poking out from his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Be a good boy and help me bail hay?” Daryl asked, watching Troy’s cock twitch in the jock. “Man, those words never fail to get you off, do they?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, never do.” Troy bent down to pick up some trash, ass in front of Daryl’s face and smirked when the hog practically buried his snout in his rear. “And somehow my ass never fails to get you off.”<br />
<br />
The hog slapped Troy’s ass. “Boy, you better not go wandering off the second you get your memories back.”<br />
<br />
Troy laughed. “I’ll give you my two weeks notice as a courtesy.”<br />
<br />
“That’s the way of things, isn’t it?” The hog sighed. “Let’s make hay while the sun is shining, eh?”<br />
<br />
And they did. Literally.<br />
<br />
Troy helped milk the cows, feed the pigs (which he saw as something of cannibalism), gather eggs from the coop. Daryl had a massive farm, actually, and was glad for all the help Troy could give him. And Troy had freakish amounts of stamina.<br />
<br />
Daryl cut out early to make dinner. He always made big dinners. And breakfasts. And lunches. Troy knew that the constant beer and food would eventually damage his own waistline if he weren’t working as much, but the hog…well, he wasn’t stupid and he was the one feeding him, so Troy suspected he wouldn’t mind if Troy gained a pound or twelve.<br />
<br />
He sighed, admired his tightly defined abs while he still had them, and shoveled manure in the horse stalls. By the time he was done, the sun was setting in the sky and he was soaked in sweat.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The big bearded hog was on his front porch, drinking beer and watching the game when Troy finished all his chores. He wore a camo baseball hat and overalls and not much else. Troy climbed up his stairs and stood awkwardly, waiting for Daryl to look away from the game. Daryl kept staring at the screen, taking sips of beer every few minutes. <br />
<br />
Troy finally cleared his throat and the hog took notice of him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Troy, didn’t see you there. Pull up a squat.” The hog patted the cushion next to his large and hairy body.<br />
<br />
Troy plopped onto the dingy couch next to him and tipped towards Daryl unintentionally. His couch clearly had a divot where he sat. Daryl didn’t mind, throwing a hock around Troy’s neck and pulling him close, snuffling him.<br />
<br />
“Be a good boy and beer me?” Daryl asked.<br />
<br />
“Beer?” Troy adjusted himself.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s an alcoholic beverage made of fermented wheat in a bottle” Daryl pointed at a bucket full of ice and bottles. “Just pop off the cap and tip it in my mouth.”<br />
<br />
“Uh.” Troy shrugged, “Sure, I guess.”<br />
<br />
He pulled out a bottle and popped the cap with his claw. Daryl leaned forward. Troy stuck the bottle upside down in his mouth. The hog chugged it, some beer dropping from his maw and running down his chest. He finished and burped.<br />
<br />
“Ah man, again.” Daryl demanded.<br />
<br />
Troy shrugged and stuck another bottle in the pig’s mouth, watching his Adam’s apple bob as he drunk it, spilling less this time. His cock twitched. It was kinda cute, like bottle feeding a big redneck baby.<br />
<br />
Daryl whirled a finger. Troy dug out another bottle and upended it in the hog’s mouth. His hand cupped the back of the hog’s head and he tipped it back. The liquid vanished down the hog’s throat. Daryl burped again and oinked happily, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. His piggy eyes noted the growing tent in Troy’s pants.<br />
<br />
“Alright, your turn bud.” The hog dug reached down beside him and came up with a beer bottle.<br />
<br />
“Wait, I-” Troy protested and choked as the hog shoved the bottle in his mouth.<br />
<br />
The sour liquid threatened to drown him. It began to spill over his mouth. He panicked, but the hog was there.<br />
<br />
“Be a good boy. Relax, let it down your throat.” Daryl advised. “Careful bud, don’t choke.”<br />
<br />
Troy took his advice, draining the beer straight down his gullet. Daryl pulled the empty bottle away and Troy burped gratefully. The hog rubbed his thigh, hooflets brushing against his cock.<br />
<br />
“There ya go Bud!” The hog nodded in approval and brought another beer out. “Here comes the next!”<br />
<br />
The hog shoved the bottle in his mouth and held Troy steady, liquid draining bit by bit into his gullet. Troy managed to spill less and even began to chug, the hog tipping the bottle a bit for him. Empty. The hog tossed the empty into the trash.<br />
<br />
“Final one. How’re ya feeling, Bud?” Daryl asked.<br />
<br />
“Um-urp! Oka-” Troy began but the hog shoved the bottle in his mouth.<br />
<br />
This one went down much easier than the other two, Troy chugging happily. The hog rubbed his cock through his pants. The liquid emptied and Daryl tossed the empty and Troy burped, rubbing his bloated gut. He was feeling a bit buzzed now, dizzy.<br />
<br />
“Alright, took ‘em like a champ!” Daryl patted Troy’s tight belly. “Good boy!”<br />
<br />
Troy’s cock jumped.<br />
<br />
“Watch the game with me?” The hog’s blue eyes pleaded.<br />
<br />
“Shower?”<br />
<br />
“You can run a little late, they won’t mind.” The hog leaned over and sniffed him. “And I like you like this. Please?”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and nuzzled into the crook of the hog’s shoulder, giving a sniff of his own. The hog leaned down and tentatively gave him a kiss. Troy kissed back, enjoying the taste of beer and the feel of those tusks. The hog rubbed Tory’s thigh and ran his hooflets across Troy’s straining cock.<br />
<br />
“Ya make me so happy Troy.” Daryl whispered. “Such a good boy.”<br />
<br />
Troy eyed the hog’s straining pants and licked his chops.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want a bone?&quot; The hog whispered.<br />
<br />
Troy nodded. <br />
<br />
Daryl unzipped his shorts, letting his long porcine cock unfurl. Troy’s mouth watered. Daryl hand pressed on the back of Troy&#39;s head, gentle but insistent, and he found himself being pushed down towards that porcine length. Troy flinched.<br />
<br />
&quot;It ain&#39;t gonna suck itself.&quot; Daryl whispered. &quot;Be a good boy and relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hand pressed down again. Troy relaxed, head descending past the curve of the hog&#39;s belly. The tip of Daryl&#39;s penis drooled precum inches away from his nose. He lapped at it, savoring the sweet taste.<br />
<br />
Troy took the tip of Daryl’s hog in his mouth. The hand pressed him down further, forcing more and more of his throbbing length down the eager Rottweiler&#39;s throat until his nose bumped the hog&#39;s musky pubes. Troy took big whiffs, tongue rolling the cock around in his mouth and suckled on it.<br />
<br />
“Good boy.” Daryl moaned, rubbing Troy’s ears. “Such a good boy.”<br />
<br />
Troy’s paws moved, cupping and teasing the hog’s enormous testicles, feeling their weight. The hog’s hand pressed him down harder and the other slowly moved across Troy’s body, clenching and squeezing his enormous muscles. Troy moaned happily, nub wriggling. The hog&#39;s finger&#39;s circled his rear entrance, then slipped inside his hole, rubbing something in Troy that made his cock hard.<br />
<br />
Daryl’s breath quickened as Troy bobbed faster and faster, increasing the suction. The hog&#39;s hips bucked, slamming Troy’s muzzle into the hog’s pelvis bone. Over and over, each buck more insistent, holding Troy in place. Troy could feel Daryl getting close, the hog&#39;s penis throbbing, balls tensing.<br />
<br />
Daryl squeeled happily and unloaded in Troy&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Troy swallowed, but the Daryl&#39;s hand kept him pressed under the hog’s gut. The cock spasmed again. Daryl soothed him, encouraged him, called him a good boy. Troy was a whimpering mess when the final shot of cum trickled down his throat twenty minutes later.<br />
<br />
Daryl&#39;s grip loosened and the hog finally let him go. Troy gasped for air and stood up. His cock bobbed in front of Daryl’s bearded face, drooling precum.<br />
<br />
“Be a good boy and let me taste you.” Daryl said, reaching out, taking Troy’s cock in his mouth and sucking.<br />
<br />
Daryl had mastered cock sucking. Troy moaned, enjoying the feeling of his cock sliding between Daryl’s blunt tusks and down into the hog’s eager throat. Daryl stared up at him the whole time as he bobbed and sucked, watching him twitch and moan. Seeing his handsome hog looking up at him with his pretty blue eyes while Troy’s dick was in his mouth was too much.<br />
<br />
“Daryl I-I can’t-!” Tory gasped, hips thrusting involuntarily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be a good boy and cum for me.&quot; The hog murmured around Troy&#39;s rigid shaft  and bobbed faster. <br />
<br />
Troy came into Daryl&#39;s mouth hard, spilling what felt like a whole lifetime’s worth of seed into the greedy hog’s mouth. He panted happily as the hog cleaned up, slurping all the cum he could off the dog&#39;s dick. Troy fell back on the couch and shared a beer.<br />
<br />
They fell asleep together watching replays of a college football game.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next night, Troy did his rounds of the Warehouse, tags jangling happily on his collar. The owners were waiting for someone, but they wanted him to come to the meeting. It had rained recently, the night air filled with the sound of  crickets and the smell of cool petrichor filling his nose. He took a deep breath and entered.<br />
<br />
Standing around a table with a large, leather-bound book on it were three people. Troy recognized Tex, the enormously muscular but kindly bull who owned the warehouse dressed in a plaid button down and blue jeans. Next was a very twunky skunk wearing chic clothes that smelled absolutely amazing. Troy could eat his ass with a spoon, as Daryl was want to say about Troy. Finally, there was a Police Dog-a member of the Anthro K-9 Unit. He was a rather naughty-looking Doberman, muscled up and covered in tats. Troy guessed he was an undercover cop. He wasn’t in uniform, but he’d smelled him around here a few times. Handsome, but not really Troy’s type. Muscles were a dime-a-dozen nowadays.<br />
<br />
“Troy. Thank you for coming.” Tex nodded.<br />
<br />
“Weren’t you waiting for someone?” Troy asked, cocking his head.<br />
<br />
“You.” The police dog shrugged. “My name is Rusty. You were supposed to talk with us last night but you were…occupied. Or so I heard.”<br />
<br />
Troy flushed. “Yes. Daryl and I are…together.”<br />
<br />
“Are you happy with him?” The Police Dog probed. “He’s not taking advantage of a head injury victim, is he?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Troy blushed. “I know that he isn’t…traditionally handsome. But he saved my life and…”<br />
<br />
The police dog held up his hand. “I had some pictures. We’ve discovered your identity.”<br />
<br />
“Pictures?”<br />
<br />
“Do you want to see them?”<br />
<br />
“Will…” Troy chose his words carefully. “Will they miss me?”<br />
<br />
“They don’t know you anymore either. You had a fiance but someone attacked you both during the unstable period that follows undergoing The Treatment.”<br />
<br />
Troy stared into the dog’s eyes, sensing pain. He detected a searching look there. “You’re my real boyfriend, then?”<br />
<br />
The Doberman stared back. “How did you…?”<br />
<br />
“I guessed. You’re the police dog who took my statement that day. Rusty.” Troy nodded to himself. “I was wondering why you kept asking me if my memories had returned. More importantly, you introduced yourself with your first name. That’s unprofessional. You’d only do that if I knew who you were.”<br />
<br />
Rusty sighed. “You want to stay with Daryl then, babe?”<br />
<br />
“He needs me, Rusty, he’s all alone on that farm.” Troy said. “And…I think I’m falling in love with him.”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded. “I accept your decision. I can’t remember our relationship at all either. I&#39;m, uh, with Tex now anyways.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Troy raised a brow. &quot;I assumed you&#39;d be with the skunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m a skunk because Rusty is a vindictive dick.&quot; RK cleared his throat. “We need to give you the run down on what’s happening.”<br />
<br />
Troy listened. At times he was shocked, but he listened. He listened to their plan to take out Myth. Then he came up with a better plan.</p>
