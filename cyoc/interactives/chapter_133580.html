<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle yawned as he got out of bed. The events of yesterday seemed like a dream to him. There was no way his sister had turned into a dog. Stuff like that didn&#39;t happen in real life, but the transformation was so vivid in his mind. He wanted to see it again. He wanted to see Ally become a dog again. He knew any normal person would be terrified of the power contained in the coin, but he was intoxicated by it. He had to use the trigger, at least one more time.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ally was still trying to sort out the events of yesterday. She had managed to fall asleep naked in the living room. Even stranger, she couldn&#39;t remember how she got there. Any sane person would investigate further, but a small part of her didn&#39;t care. No, that wasn&#39;t it. A small part of her enjoyed waking up there. It was as if that was what she was supposed to do. As if she was a Good...<br />
<br />
She shook her head, losing that train of thought. It didn&#39;t matter right now. She needed to get breakfast. Kyle was already waiting in the kitchen. He smiled unnaturally at her. He suddenly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ally, you&#39;re a Good Dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ally froze in her tracks. She was a good dog? A good dog? A.. Good... Dog. The trigger finally sank in. &quot;Woof!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ally needed to take off her clothes. Dogs weren&#39;t supposed to wear clothes. She stripped as fast as she could, throwing the clothes to a corner of the room. She could already feel dog fur growing on every inch of her body. She was able to rip off her bra with one of her claws, as her fingers started fusing together. She fell forward, landing on all fours. She was momentarily grateful that she wasn&#39;t wearing shoes, as her feet curled out into hind paws, before forgetting the concept of shoes entirely. The fur had grown thick around every inch of her body and her breasts turned into a bitch&#39;s tiny nipples. She howled as her face pushed out into a muzzle.<br />
&quot;rrr... Wroof! Wroof!&quot; <br />
The transformation had completed. Ally had turned back into a German Shepherd. She panted mindlessly, happily staring up at her Master. He moved over to a pile of fabric on the floor. Ally didn&#39;t see what was so interesting about it. She was much more important than it. She ran up and tackled her owner, happily licking him on the face. She wanted to play!<br />
<br />
Kyle had a hard time keeping his boner down. He was well aware of the uncomfortable intersection of incest and bestiality. However, it wasn&#39;t like that. He didn&#39;t want to have sex with his sister, and he didn&#39;t want to have sex with a dog. Rather, he was aroused by the link between the two. Seeing the normally uptight Ally, become a mindless animal was fascinating to him. It was the ultimate form of liberation he could think of. His mind was racing with the endless scenarios and possibilities in front of him.<br />
<br />
Trying to calm himself down, he walked over to his sister&#39;s discarded clothes. It surprised him that she had managed the forethought to take them off during her transformation. He dimly noted that none of them were ripped, before he was suddenly tackled. He giggled as the dog licked his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Down, Ally. Down. Get off of me.&quot; Kyle lightly pushed her off, causing her to whine softly. Ally tried getting back on top, but a quick. &quot;Stay.&quot; caused her to stop in her tracks.<br />
<br />
Kyle stood up and smiled. For all intents and purposes, Ally was now a well-trained German Shepherd. It was good to know that she would obey commands in this form. Ally, who was bored of waiting, started rubbing herself on her Master&#39;s leg. Well, she obeyed commands about as well as a dog, though Kyle. He gave her a quick pet, causing Ally to quickly pant.<br />
<br />
Acting on a hunch, he stopped petting her, and issued a command. &quot;Ally, Barbie Doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dog froze, and robotically walked over to her discarded clothes. As her paws started changing back into human hands, she unconsciously started putting back on her clothes. She changed at a rapid pace, not bothering to be modest. By the time the last of the fur had receded, she was fully clothed.<br />
<br />
Ally blinked twice, confused. Had she fallen asleep?<br />
&quot;Is everything okay Ally?&quot; her brother asked, concerned.<br />
She must have spaced out for a second. She must have been more tired than she thought.<br />
&quot;Everything&#39;s fine, just...&quot; The tag of her shirt was scratching her. &quot;I must have put my shirt on backwards this morning.&quot; <br />
She could have sworn she put it on right when she woke up, but she wasn&#39;t going to question it. It was such a minor detail, it could have easily slipped her mind.<br />
<br />
Kyle breathed a small sigh of relief. If he used the &#39;Barbie Doll&#39; trigger while Ally was awake, she would change back into her clothes as if nothing had happened. In her rush though, she put her shirt on backwards.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that for?&quot; asked his sister testily. <br />
&quot;Oh, nothing. Just thinking about my clumsy sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ally rolled her eyes at the insult, and poured some cereal. For some reason, she could remember a different way of eating it. She shook her head, dismissing the odd thought, before getting a spoon like a normal person. She frowned. She had been acting kind of clumsy lately. She shrugged, not worrying about it while she ate her breakfast.<br />
<br />
Kyle was relieved there weren&#39;t any side effects. People would get suspicious if Ally started acting like a dog without him around. But still, it was time for bigger and brighter things. Since he had already finished his breakfast, he headed to his room to grab the hypnosis coin. He was already excited by the possibilities.</p>
