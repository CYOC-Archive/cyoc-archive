<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick thought, “I don’t want to have problems buying clothes. Let’s go for buff.” He clicked the correct button and the machine beeped. <br />
<br />
FOR BEST RESULTS, OTHER RELATED CHANGES MAY APPLY. CONTINUE (Y/N)?<br />
<br />
Patrick was normally a pretty analytical and cautious guy but the idea of becoming more athletic had subsumed his entire mind and he blindly tapped the Y button. <br />
<br />
The machine beeped again. COMMENCING PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION. DURATION: 17 MINUTES<br />
<br />
Patrick set the machine down and a beam of blue light emitted from the end, enveloping the skinny teen in its glow. Patrick felt uncomfortably warm and stripped off his shirt and pants, leaving himself only in his tighty whities and socks. <br />
<br />
Slowly, gently, Patrick’s body began to fill out. His flat chest inflated as two pectoral muscles asserted themselves. In the next minute, he thrilled to see his flat skinny stomach cobble over with a 6-pack of abs. The next minute felt his back and lats expand, giving him a classic V-shaped torso. After that, the sensation moved to his legs and he felt his thighs touch as the quads expanded in both length and muscularity, then a pulling feeling as his calves grew. Next were his arms, bulking up with surprisingly big biceps and triceps, followed by his stick-thin wrist and forearm getting meatier and veiny. The final piece of him was his neck, which thickened and grew longer as sizable traps asserted themselves. <br />
<br />
Patrick stared at himself in the mirror as the blue light faded. Looking back at him was a tall, buff, near-perfect version of himself. <br />
<br />
The machine beeped. Patrick looked over and was confused. Only seven minutes in, but the timer was still counting down. The emitter now radiated a soft green light. <br />
<br />
Patrick opened his eyes wide as his jaw became more pronounced, which a slight cleft. His cheekbones raised as his ears jutted out just slightly from his head. His eyes changed from brown to hazel green, and he gasped as his nose, which he had broken years ago falling out of a tree, straightened itself with a painful snap. A slight pressure in his head made him realize his brow ridge had become more prominent, giving him a more masculine cast to his face. He felt warm again as his body tanned, and a tugging sensation as his hair rearranged itself into a slightly longer style. And he noted with some alarm that his body hair had grown out, with a considerable amount of leg hair, a treasure trail, some chest hair, the beginnings of forearm hair, and beard stubble appearing as though conjured. And there was a very pleasurable feeling in his crotch as his former five-inch penis—perfectly respectable for a mid-teenager—was replaced with a nine-inch rod. <br />
<br />
The green glow faded and the machine beeped. Looking back from the mirror was an absolute heartbreaker of a teenager, who looked slightly older than his age, with model-like proportions and aesthetics.<br />
<br />
Patrick looked at the machine. 6 minutes left on the countdown timer as the display changed to COMMENCING MENTAL TRANSFORMATION. The green light changed to an orangey yellow. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Patrick felt the weight of his crippling social anxiety lift, replaced with the cocky confidence of an athlete who just knows how to act around anyone. Knowledge of sports, both how to play them and of professional and college competitions, pervaded his head; he would never again be left out of manly conversations. His hand-eye coordination improved with a click and he started tossing a ball out of nervous energy, catching it deftly each time. Knowledge of how to flirt appropriately entered his head and he noted with some bemusement that it included both genders. Even his sense of humor changed, as he chuckled at the idea of being a little prankster.<br />
<br />
The yellowish glow subsided and the machine beeped. Patrick was thrilled. This was beyond his wildest dreams. A tall, handsome young man who could easily have passed for 19 or even 21 looked back from the mirror. <br />
<br />
Puzzled, Patrick looked at the timer, which still had two minutes to go. A red light transmitted from the machine, consuming the whole room, and Patrick felt a dull ache in his head. He tried to grab his head but he found he couldn’t move. There was an audible pop as the trophy he had just won in math club disappeared. He had won it for a complex geometric proof, but when he tried to think through it he couldn’t remember what he had done. The pressure increased as Patrick’s IQ drained out of his head and his room adjusted to that of a jock. The academic trophies and certificates disappeared, replaced by trophies with figures doing a surprising number of sports: football, basketball, baseball, swimming, track, wrestling, even shooting sports. Panicking, Patrick tried to clutch onto knowledge of higher concepts. He looked over at his bookshelf, desperate to remember Proust and Kierkegaard and Shakespeare, only to find his mind disinterested as the books disappeared. The maps on his walls of fantasy lands like Middle-Earth were replaced with sports heroes and busty girls. His knowledge of Spanish, French, Latin, and Japanese disappeared as he became firmly monolingual. The glow of intelligence behind his eyes faded to a dullness as the red light faded. <br />
<br />
The machine beeped and the display changed. Patrick just stared as the last vestiges of his old self flew away. The process, combined with the amount of testosterone required to keep his body in such perfect condition, gave him a sense of euphoria and a cocky, dumb grin spread across his face as the display changed for the last time. <br />
