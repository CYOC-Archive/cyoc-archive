<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rose’s heart beat was a mile a minute, so much so that in her medical student mind she thought she had to be nearing the danger point. She knew that a heart could only beat so fast before it became dangerous. Then suddenly she had something much worse to worry about as she found she had trouble breathing. Unlike a few hours ago when it happened to Amanda she knew what was happening, taking one last breath of air she dove her head down. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright, take a breath you have gills now.” Said the green mermaid as Rose held her breath still but soon exhaled, bubbles and inhaled sea water. She felt the water rush into her mouth, down her throat into her lungs and then out her sides. She blinked as she reached for her neck but felt it still smooth.<br />
<br />
“Your gills are at your side.” Explained the mermaid, as Rose moved her hand down and touched the slits on her side, there where five of them going from largest to smallest started just below her breasts and moving downward.  “Some mermaids have it at the neck some on the side.”<br />
<br />
Rose took a moment breathing in the sea, she tried to steady her heart beat but it was still going so fast. Then she winced a bit as her wrists started to hurt, she turned and looked at them as a new extension grew out of her wrist moving downward in a curve before stopping about even with the elbow. Then connecting the elbow with this new part of her a red membrane began to grow. She had arm fins.<br />
Then her chest began to hurt and her heart rate shot up, she had already accepted monster hood but she didn’t want to become a male. She feared that the most. She didn’t have to worry.<br />
<br />
She looked down at her breasts, of all her friends she had the smallest bust at an A cup however she did have the smallest frame, so it evened out. Here her breasts where actually going up, they were still A but now looked larger on her frame. With that horror seemed to have passed she felt the change rush down to her legs. She watched as her legs where pulled together and stretched out growing longer, almost a foot or more was added to her length just from the tail. She thought for a moment she was becoming an eel until her feet snapped to either side and a fin began to form. It wasn’t a shark fin like Amanda’s but while classic looking it seemed slightly narrower, as in it formed a sharp V instead of a more rounded broad fin. <br />
<br />
It was then the color began to come in, it was a bright red, with some lighter reds and pinks mixed in but the bulk was red. The membrane around the tail and on her arms turned into a pink, and while she couldn’t see it her natural red hair lightened turning into a pink color. The scales stopped around her hips forming a slight V formation like the classic mermaids all seemed to have. She had some scales around her gills and under her breasts but other then that her top half almost stayed the same. <br />
<br />
“I think you are done.” Said the mermaid who had been watching her transform. “Let’s get you a top before you go see your friends.”<br />
Unlike Amanda, Rose had no back fin and was able to use any top, in this case a seaweed top with some pink and red shells. It went with her tail color, the mermaid said. <br />
<br />
“Are you doing ok?” inquired Amanda<br />
<br />
“I think so.” answered Rose as ran her hands over her new tail. “This is just strange.”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Answered Amanda<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry you will get used to it.” Answered the mermaid. “Now lets go talk to your friends and get the next one transformed.”<br />
Rose gulped a deep breath of water and turned and headed around the L shaped corner and came into the view of her friends.<br />
<br />
“Rose?” inquired her best friend Taylor<br />
<br />
“Yes, this is just so strange.” Answered Taylor through the underwater microphone. <br />
<br />
“You will get used to it.” Answered the doctor “All of you will.”<br />
<br />
“Who is next?” inquired Rose as Taylor raised her hand and headed toward the same chamber Rose had just been in.  Rose, Amanda and the mermaid nurse all swam around the corner and watched, there was a splash as a nude Taylor jumped into the water. She surfaced and the transformation began.<br />
<br />
Unlike Rose’s which seamed to start at the top and work its way down, Taylor’s started at her feet and worked it way up. Her ankles snapped together load enough for them to hear, as her feet snapped 90 degrees and began to turn into a large broad fin. Also, different then either of their changes Taylor’s fin changed color before the scales came in, turning into a pattern of black and white which ran up her forming tail.<br />
<br />
“My God, we got a rare one.” Announced the Mermaid nurse as both Amanda and Rose recognized the pattern. It was the black and white pattern of a killer whale. The pattern didn’t stop at Taylor’s hips but kept going and started to form at her hands as well. A large back fin began to grow as the pattern covered her chest, white flesh forming almost a heart shape over her breast before thinning out and running to under her chin. Her face was mostly black expect for large circles around her eyes which where white. Her brown hair remained short but quickly turned to white. No scales formed instead her flesh remained that, flesh.<br />
<br />
“What…am I?” inquired Taylor as she looked at herself <br />
<br />
“A whale mermaid. It is extremely rare, only 1 in every 100,000 mermaids are like you.” Answered the Nurse with amazement in her voice. “It is hard to explain, while we call it a whale mermaid, you have gills and can breathe underwater it is just instead of scales you have flesh and unlike other mermaids you can still breath air.”<br />
<br />
“I can?” said Taylor in amazement as she kicked to the surface and after a moment she swam back down. “I can…wow…I can still talk to my family and…”<br />
<br />
She stopped when she saw the looks on Rose’s and Amanda’s face, neither of them would be able to speak to their families outside of speakers. Taylor had something they didn’t.<br />
<br />
“Now lets get you a top, three down…three to go.” Said the Mermaid nurse.</p>
