<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let me see if I can figure &#39;me&#39;&quot; out for a bit. Hasn&#39;t even been a hour yet, in fact its been 17 minutes, 32 seconds in cou... argh!&quot; cried Rick in frustration. &quot;Yeah, just give me sometime to figure things out. In the mean time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily came up with an idea. &quot;You know, I could explore &#39;you&#39; while you get your bearings, but I really want to try out some more alien forms. Think you can leave the settings and I just press the button?&quot; asked to a camera. She had both sets of arms in a clasped, begging motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... sure. I think I&#39;m really good at multi tasking now but that should help with me taking things in. And you can change the settings if you want... but not yet! Maybe we should take...things... slowww...&quot; Rick trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rick, you okay?&quot; a concerned  Emily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I just discovered my sensors! And I&#39;m sensing...alot. Go have fun!&quot; The tone of voice Rick gave was like a mother (completely with female voice) shooing a kid away.<br />
<br />
Emily shrugged, and took her seat, and pressed the button. The flash came again with a slight disorientation.<br />
<br />
She found found the limb near the screen was now grey, and her vantage point was now closer to the ground. She had an idea of what she became, but rather than spend more time looking at her limb and down at herself, she walked... or waddled to the mirrors to get a better view.<br />
<br />
She was a stereotypical grey alien. She was... wait how could she tell what her height was? &quot;Hey Rick, do these mirrors have statistics or so... woah my voice.&quot; Emily noticed the words came out, but it was so monotone and nearly robotic, with a hint of leaning towards a male. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m trying to concentrate here! I think I have gas... wait not that kind of gas! Anyways... there you go.&quot; responded Rick, and suddenly some data popped up on the mirrors... and with options. Looks like Rick is starting to think ahead in case Emily asked more questions.<br />
<br />
Back to the grey alien. The screen confirmed her to be about 3 foot tall, and her proportions definitely fit the grey description. Her arms almost went down to her knees, and she still had the long thumbs and two fingers with no nails. However, her fingers were bulbous at the tips, seeming like they may have more subtle function, or just being very unwieldy. Her legs were humanoid again, but very short to add reason to the small height. Her feet were oddly big, and would be comparable to clown shoes if weren&#39;t for the small surface area but large and long 3 toes. Thinking about it, her legs did look odd to her torso and was probably the reason why she waddled instead of walking earlier, but she continued taking in the rest of her form.<br />
<br />
Her torso was a mix between being inhumanly emaciated with a belly sticking out, not in the fat way, but it just happened to be there. And she was also naked, although she seemed to have no identifiable genitals, just empty spaces where in the groin and chest area. Looking behind her, she did have the barest forms to have a buttocks, but some quick exploration revealed she didn&#39;t have a hole back there either. She seemed to be both genderless and defying normal biology. Well, Earth biology.<br />
<br />
Next she finally took in her head. The thing was huge, making up for a third her height. Comparing to an upside down tear drop or possibly even a light bulb came close to describing its shape, down to an incredibly pointy chin. She seemed to barely have a mouth with no identifiable lips, and two slight holes to make for an area of a nose. Her eyes were massive, black soulless orbs. She could sense motion when she tested moving them around, but otherwise couldn&#39;t really tell where they were looking other then being pretty sure when she was looking forward. She didn&#39;t seem to have ears, although she seemed to be &quot;hearing&quot; the usual sounds coming from the ship. And then just the huge upper round shape of her head. She couldn&#39;t even user her relatively long arms to reach the top of it. She wondered if she had a huge brain to go with it?<br />
<br />
She decided to do have some fun toying with the body and testing some things. Her sight did seem to be affected, at least for the wideness of vision and sharpness. She had a clumsy gait and maybe felt this body was the result more relying in intelligence than flesh. She tried being expressive with her face, but there was little she could do with a lack of features other then playing with her eyelids and doing her best with her detail-less mouth. She even tried rubbing herself, anywhere, to see if she could feel pleasure, but nothing came other then she did seem to have a more sensitive touch, in a non-sexual manner. Still, it was a blast to do this-and-that in front of the mirrors, and where she lacked in expressiveness in her face, she learned to make up with in body language, including make 2 middle finger motions. She even had fun talking in her monotone, near-robotic voice.<br />
<br />
She decided to mess with the mirror&#39;s data options too, and found how it could tell her alot about her biology, but what stood out the most was she did seem to have psychic abilities and brain activity should make her a genius to humans, she didn&#39;t feel like it at the moment. Maybe like Rick seemed to need to figure out being a ship, she would need to figure out her alien forms? Even the milf alien she was previously didn&#39;t make her a pro at the new proportions and heels.<br />
<br />
Sometime passed and Emily decided to check on Rick. &quot;Hey Rick, how&#39;s it going? Status Report?&quot; cold questioned Emily, not like she could do much about the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Status Report Captain: Integration with Rick&#39;s system is currently progressing and...woah. &quot; Responded rick, sounding like a typical, female AI voice right up until the last moment. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m getting use to...me. I practiced looking at you while doing anything else so I&#39;m getting alot better at looking through the cameras, sometimes multiple at once. I&#39;m trying to figure out movement as the ship but my processor... ship brain is kind of making me go through procedures so we don&#39;t warp travel into the sun on accident. That, and I think I&#39;m starting to THINK like a computer. This is so weird.&quot; Explained Rick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Need any help from me?&quot; asked a concerned Emily, well concerned in her body language if not her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Negative, Rick will proceed with...I&#39;ll be fine and take it easy. Just have fun. The Truth Is Out there.&quot; Responded Rick, with the last message as an obvious pop culture nod to Emily&#39;s current Grey Alien form.<br />
<br />
So she went back to the chair, noticing it lowered for her current height to get back in and lifted back up to the proper height, and she pressed the button for another change. <br />
<br />
She was a white haired, black woman in scandalous, Egyptian themed clothing. As in the literal color black. If it wasn&#39;t for her alluring eyes, her hair, and her clothing, it was hard to tell any details about herself outside of being what seemed to be a living silhouette. With the usual fun in the mirrors, she definitely confirmed having some curves, but was hard to tell by sight alone. <br />
<br />
Sometime passed, and she went to press the button again.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t see, but she could SEE. She didn&#39;t need to mirrors this time to take in her body, but she could tell it didn&#39;t come with eyeballs, just a very &quot;alien&quot; sense of perception. Although she felt more comfortable on all fours, she seemed to be a black, exoskeleton clad humanoid with a very lethal tail and claws on all limbs. With a penile shaped head, and she discovered to be a mouth within her mouth, it was very alien indeed. The form left no room for expression in the face, just designed to be a killing machine, but as before, she had her silly fun experiencing the form and even signaled to Rick when he stopped to worry about her, as she could only make screeches in this form.<br />
<br />
Barely able sit in the chair with her tail, she pressed the button.<br />
<br />
She was now covered in tentacles with eyeballs and no real other perceivable limbs other than she could sit in the captain&#39;s chair still with a slight humanoid shape. This one was a real doozy, and felt more like an eldritch abomination than anything humanoid. <br />
<br />
She pressed the button.<br />
<br />
She was sky-blue colored, tentacled-haired woman with with an attractive gymnast build, in a latex outfit that seemed more for stripping than anything else.<br />
<br />
She press the button. <br />
<br />
She was something like cattle as she closely put to it, including being more comfortable on four limbs again. The major difference was she was more leathery like an elephant, and her head was slug-shaped with bulbous eyes at the end of it, luckily not with stalks. Oh and she was very male. Her penis and balls may have looked very alien, but it was obvious it was a very large penis.<br />
<br />
She pressed the button.<br />
<br />
Now she seemed to be an actual slug, slightly smaller than a human in size and with enough &quot;arms&quot; to still interact with the screen and mirrors. It seemed at the very least that no matter how exotic her forms got, it did try to match her up with the ship, chair, and usability of the screen. She also had fun being an hermaphrodite and even capable of having sex with herself. She hoped Rick enjoyed the show...</p>
