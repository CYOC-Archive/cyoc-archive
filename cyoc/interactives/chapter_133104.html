<br />
So you&#39;d been turned into a cat girl maid, seen a guy turned into a cat girl maid, had your personality rewritten several times as part of your job, just found out a friend of yours was now working at a rival transformation zapping cafe, got into a fight with a fox woman, AND found out your mother could change into a super powered little girl and kept hoping you&#39;d become a super powered little girl too, and now that you&#39;d become a cat girl maid, you&#39;d failed to live up to her hopes and dreams.<br />
<br />
All this happening in the span of one day was overwhelming, you imagined it was the magic of your contract that was keeping you from going stark raving mad at all these revelations.<br />
<br />
It was Tuesday, and the second day of work. Was actually less crazy was how Phyllis had actually asked to sleep over like they were a couple of teenage girls. But given everything else... you just went along with it. At least mom didn&#39;t seem to mind.<br />
<br />
... You had failed your mother, not able to live up to what she&#39;d secretly wanted for you for decades... As a daughter, and as a proper cat girl maid you felt awful, yeah, you were pretty sure the mental enchantments were actually keeping you sane.<br />
<br />
What would your father think? Late that night, you&#39;d asked,<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, does dad know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he does, oh,&quot; She looked at your cat ears and tail. &quot;You mean about me being a Magical Girl? Very much yes! I didn&#39;t want to marry him and keep that from him. I figured that if I kept it from him, he&#39;d find out in a way that I didn&#39;t have control over. He was just relieved I wasn&#39;t part of a cult or something! ... And no, I haven&#39;t called him and told him about... what happened... I imagine that if this enchantment works the way it was supposed to, he may or may not even notice your change... I&#39;ll leave it for you to tell him.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were happy that dad was out of town that night, but that wasn&#39;t going to last very long AT ALL....<br />
<br />
You mother was upset enough at your new career move.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t feel like explaining to your mother that Nora had told you that she hadn&#39;t aged a day since taking on the job at the cafe, and combined with the promise of lifetime job security, you were looking at a very long career. At least your contract promised the legally obliged vacation time (even if you&#39;d still be legally &#39;employed&#39; in that time, so you&#39;d still be a cat girl maid and... you were fine with that, you wondered how you&#39;d like in a black swim suit with white lace ).<br />
<br />
One of the crazier things was how Phyllis had no trouble putting on or off her dress, or putting on a night gown, or anything that might have hinted that she hadn&#39;t been male that morning. And your clothes had morphed into French lace as soon as you put them on, and STAYED that way when you took them off.<br />
<br />
You actually felt somewhat uncomfortable with Phyllis in your room, given what you knew, but what she remarked on after watching the anime.<br />
<br />
She admitted, &quot;Ya know ... I&#39;m not getting anything from the ladies in the anime, I can tell they&#39;re good looking and everything but I just... don&#39;t feel anything special. The guys on the other hand... they suddenly seem... a lot more interesting.&quot; Phyllis admitted, she didn&#39;t sound scared or confused, more like she was just making an observation.<br />
<br />
You found Mom was already gone when you woke up. You hoped she didn&#39;t do anything foolish to Madam Rikku Minazuki, as one of her loyal maids, you natural felt concern for her safety.<br />
<br />
After washing, and making sure you were perfectly presentable, came a modest breakfast. Since she&#39;d slept over, Phyllis offered to give you a ride down to work.<br />
<br />
It had been late last night, and the last thing on your mind, but now you asked,<br />
&quot;Phyllis, did your car have a hole for tails before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... now that you ask, no, it didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t really think about it before. I guess it has to do with making me being a cat girl maid be normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then realized you were very very VERY GRATEFUL that your mother HADN&#39;T seen your stitched up claw marks on your back from your fight with Frisky, the last thing you needed was your mother thinking your job was dangerous! Hopefully they&#39;d heal soon enough and mother wouldn&#39;t notice. At least Frisky was going to sporting marks on her face for a while... you wondered... would that LESSEN her presentation as a lovely lady of her establishment, or would it add to a &#39;bad girl&#39; persona? Presentation was important, and even if she brow beat Luan/Fifi for just saying high to you, you didn&#39;t want to ruin someone else&#39;s presentation, it wasn&#39;t proper for a maid to do.<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Madam Rikku Minazuki hoped that Phyllis and Beverly enjoyed the &#39;welcome to the family&#39; treat baskets she&#39;d made them last night... After the incredibly rough first day that Beverly had, she didn&#39;t want the girl thinking every day was going to be like that. First impressions were everything, which as a cat girl maid herself, she knew very well.<br />
<br />
As assistant manager, Nora had shown up soon after her, counting in drawers and flipping signs and getting the kitchen ready and running the daily bug check on the Persona spells. This meant she had to go through each persona before marking them off as working properly.<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t expected an angry little girl in a black dress covered with constellation diamond and a little hammer to come barging into her office.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Madam Rikku! She wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer!&quot; Nora said, the blue haired cat girl bowing repeatedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Lady Libra! Bringer of Balance, and the solemn judge of the Constellation Collaborative! Are you the owner of this place and its maids?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nora, go back to getting the shop ready for opening, and be sure to give Phyllis and Beverly their gift packages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes miss!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s in those?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy, muffins, paper grass, an exotic butter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lady Libra scanned them to ensure that they were completely mundane, magically speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot; Madam Rikku! Are you sure you&#39;ll be fine?&quot; Nora asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Nora, there&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Madam.&quot; Nora bowed and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Madam Rikku kept her calm face as best she could facing an angry ten year old with super powers. &quot;I am the owner of this cafe... but I am the EMPLOYER of the ladies who work here, not their &#39;owner&#39;, they aren&#39;t slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you call a magical bind contract that changes their bodies and mind then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They consented to the contract of their own free without force, and it&#39;s seriously cuts down on training time, and keeps things from being uncomfortable for them and customers and keeps me from having to turn down employees. I am completely certified.&quot; Madam Rikku pointed at the various certificates on the walls.<br />
<br />
Lady Libra glanced around as Madam Rikku read aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magical Trickster License, Business Owner License, Reality Distortion License, Magical Shop Owner License, Business&#39; state tax and federal tax ID numbers, Consensual Physical Transformation License, Consensual Mental Transformation License, A seal of approval from the FDA, My Small Business Owners Guild Membership Card and an up to date certificate that guaranteed I am not selling nor treating my employees as slaves, sexual or otherwise, and that all my employees have signed their contracts of their own free will and had not been coerced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lady Libra frowned and glared at Rikku.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re Beverly&#39;s sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m her mother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Well, I knew Beverly had something unusual about her with her remembering one of my employees used to be male before she&#39;d signed her contract. I assure you that I look after all my employees and ensure their safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then! I&#39;d like to say that your &#39;maids&#39; pretending to be magical girls is a very poor joke!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rikku sighed, feeling a headache coming on, she really didn&#39;t want to deal with this, but she had to.<br />
<br />
&quot;My maids becoming temporarily magical girls falls under the Cosplay Protection Act, and that the title of &#39;magical girl&#39; in of itself is public domain I might add. And we include a disclaimer that we are not associated with the Magical Girls International. And aren&#39;t you slightly stepping your bounds as a RETIRED magical girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think I&#39;m retired?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re a mother for starters. Most magical girls die in battle, or live for centuries. But you&#39;ve been mortal long enough to have a family. And realistically... if I really was an illegal cursed shop owner or a trafficker, you wouldn&#39;t be here without back up, or were insanely powerful, or you had allies hidden and the place is bugged, but I know my own home enough to know that isn&#39;t the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lady Libra noticed as she stood up, Rikku had green eyes, hair, and fur on her ears and tail that all matched the colour of her dress. Rikku pushed up on her glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see... I&#39;m a Cat Girl Maid myself... I didn&#39;t know magic when I was turned into one, but I learned. And I want to do some good with my talents and what I&#39;ve become. If you want to rattle some cages, you can try across the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Across the street?&quot; Lady Libra asked somewhat confused.<br />
<br />
Madam Rikku Minazuki sighed, adjusting her glasses, “I won’t cast baseless accusations on my competition, lest such be returned in kind. However, a close friend of mine who works for Oversight has expressed concern about the validity of the certifications of the owner of the Inu Cafe across the way...” She turned her back of the slowly deescalating Magical Girl, “I only wish I’d managed to gather real evidence or had the help of a private magician before so many youngsters were made loyal to someone about whom such heavy doubts exist. After all, if they’re wrong, the girls have awful rumours spread about their mistress and that can have mental health effects that may lead them to discard their sense of self to ensure their happiness. And if they’re true...”<br />
<br />
“Best case, some cut corners in the legalese and the worse case it may be as far as coercion or even kidnapping.” <br />
<br />
Madam Rikku gave a solemn nod when Libra had finished speaking, glad she understood the gravity of the situation. “I was going to actually make an appeal to your MGA after business hours today. My dear Nora informed me that one of your daughter’s friends had actually started working there, and I felt that I should resolve the doubts before they reach Beverly’s cute fluffy new ears.” That Madam Rikku’s expression didn’t become dreamy when she said ‘cute, fluffy’ told Libra that it was probably an unintentional addition to the sentence.<br />
<br />
“So. What do we do, then?”</p>
