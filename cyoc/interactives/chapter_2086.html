<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben, Jeff, David, and Mark arrive on The Farm one day. It didn't matter what day. All time blurred to them. They were taken off the truck, inspected by the farmer, and led to an empty stable. By day they would plow the fields with a yolk strapped to their backs. At night they would eat their dinner of oats and carrots, bray to each other, and sleep. Once a week, another farmer would come to The Farm and have them mate with female asses. They did so willingly. It was a simple life, but they were happy. Why shouldn't they be? They had known nothing else. 
<br />

<br />
The Men monitored their mules. All of them. Every man and women who had ever been changed by the Pleasure Island Night Club was watched. These three jackasses were monitored closer than the rest though. For two months nothing happened. One day though, The Men were distracted by something. This thing occupied them. It destroyed them. The Men were no more. Then something happened.
<br />

<br />
The donkey felt its ears twitch. A fly probably. It was night and the donkey was tired. The twitching ears persisted. The donkey flicked its tail to rid itself of the fly. Nothing happened. The donkey tried again. Again, nothing. He opened his eyes. There was no fly. There was something wrong however. Ben looked around. All seemed quiet. His ear twitched again. He turned his head to swat his ear with his tail when he noticed something. No tail. No fur. Just pink skin. Pink HUMAN skin. Now he remembered. Or he remebered some stuff. The last thing he DID remember was being led out of a room ON ALL FOURS! He had been a donkey! He looked around. He was standing naked in a stable. His remembered flashes from the past (day? week? month? year?). He remembered eating hay. Blech! Jeff and David and some guy named Mark. He stopped remembering when he saw the two jackasses in the stables in front of him. They were changing. Their hooves were getting lighter and pink. They pushed out into webbing, and the webbing melted into fingers and toes. The bodies of the two young mules began to shift. As they did so, the animals awoke.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Heeeaww, AAWWW Eeeeauughh!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ben looked to the stall next to him. Mark was getting his human mind back. He was braying excitedly. Jeff and David's bodies shrank somewhat in size. The stomachs became less rounded and more flat. Jeff's transformation was faster. His four legs grew shorter and stubbier. They became the arms and legs of a normal man. Hair still covered his body, but that was changing. His teeth got smaller and smaller, as did his lips and face. His muzzle shortened as it fell into the face that he lost so long ago. His nose shrank back inbetween his eyes. The brown cross on his back grew into the hair on top of his head. The grey hair on his entire body seemed to be pressed back into the form of a human male. It grew fainter and fainter until it was finally the same pink skin he had always had. As the hair on his back receded, his tail grew shorter. In a matter of seconds, it was pulled into his body until it was a bump above his bare butt. After that, it was nothing. And at long last, the ears that marked Pinochio's doom shrank and became more rounded until they were normal.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hee-haw, eeeeeauughhllll raawight! All right! I'm back!&quot;
<br />

<br />
David was also celebrating. His hair disappeared into his naked body until he was back to his old self. Unfortunately, Mark was still an ass. He was braying sadly.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey guys, Mark hasn't changed back.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Why did we change back?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Amid all the confusion, there was an awkward silence. Jeff snickered.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey guys, could you...uh, cover up?&quot;
<br />

<br />
David and Ben looked down. Ever guy in the room quickly covered his crotch with his hands.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well, this is awkward.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, you could've used that donkey dong.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Up yours, I alread had one.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Everyone laughed, even poor Mark. It was good to laugh again. But now the real story begins.</p>
