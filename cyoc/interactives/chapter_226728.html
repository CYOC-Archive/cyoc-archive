<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Is the coast clear, bro?” Luke whispered to his younger brother, Aiden, as the pair slunk into their next door neigbor’s backyard late at night.<br />
<br />
Luke had asked his twelve-year-old brother to be the role of lookout, but he hadn’t the faintest idea why. “Yeah… umm… lights are out, Mr. Sandez isn’t there. But… what are we doing, Luke? You’re… not trying to steal something, are ya?”<br />
<br />
“Just hush, I’m not taking anything.” Luke shook his head, shining his flashlight towards an old doghouse at the far end corner of the yard. “Well… not really...”<br />
<br />
“You said it was for your TikTok, right?” Aiden asked his nineteen-year-old brother, still nervous about what they were getting involved with. “Do you want me to take a video of you?”<br />
<br />
“No. Not yet. I’m just getting the ingredients for one. Can you shine the flashlight at the doghouse for me?”<br />
<br />
Aiden nodded, ever-ready to help Luke with his hair-brained endeavors, he focused the dim beam of light just like his brother asked. Luke was a wannabe TikTok star, just another nameless kid on and app full of millions of people vying for attention. Aiden knew his brother wanted it really bad though – more than anyone else. He was a born entertainer – always theatric and cracking jokes. He’d talk about it day and night, discussing social media trends with him, trying to get that one viral video that would send him rocketing into internet stardom. Over time, his ideas got weirder and weirder, Luke clearly trying to shock his audience with crazy ideas that even Aiden was starting to get worried about. Still, he followed his brother along every time – happy to spend time with him; happy to see him happy.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Buster. Com’ere!” Luke knocked on the doghouse with a hushed call, watching their neighbor’s Doberman lazily strut out to greet his visitors. Buster was supposed to be a guard dog – a shimmering coat of sleek canine muscles making it clear he was bred to intimidate, but he was more than happy to greet friendly visitors with a flurry of licks and a wagging tail despite his imposing form. Aiden knew Luke really loved dogs and he’d seen his big brother reach his hand through the fence to pet Buster practically every time they walked by the yard.<br />
<br />
“H-hey, calm down, boy!” Luke chuckled trying to push the dog away as he fished out a treat from a bag he was carrying on his hip. “Play nice and you’ll get a treat.”<br />
<br />
The nineteen-year-old boy managed to find what he was looking for, pulling out a hot dog from his bag and holding it up in front of Buster. Instantly the dog was transfixed on the food, sitting down on his haunches, begging Luke for the treat. The Doberman didn’t have to wait long. Luke knelt down and set the treat on the ground, letting the dog snap up the sausage in his maw. The boy gently pushed the hound against his doghouse, pinning him between the wooden walls and his shoulder as the dog ate.<br />
<br />
“Luke. What are you doing?” Aiden looked on with concern, still dutifully shining the flashlight at his brother and the dog as Aiden started to stroke Buster along his belly, reaching back further and further into his hand grazed along the canine’s sheath.<br />
<br />
Luke didn’t respond to Aiden, focusing on the task at hand as the dog started to squirm. “Shh- shh… it’s okay boy. Not gonna hurt ya...” Luke reassured the dog as gently grasped that fuzzy holster of dog flesh, tugging it forward and back, forward and back, until some moisture started to build on the fuzzy tip, shining under the light of the flashlight. Pink started to show as Luke tugged the sheath back, the dog’s erection coming to life under the boy’s attention as shimmering droplets of pre began to drip from the tapered tip. The dog stopped struggling, panting in pleasure as his flanks started to piston against Luke’s grasp, his hefty canine balls jostling underneath him, inflating slightly, ready to bless Luke with a fresh load of puppy batter. As that cock grew to its full eight-inches in length, dripping and ready to explode, the boy jerking him off fished out another hot dog from his bag, bun-and-all, holding it up just an inch away from the drooling tip of Buster cock, waiting for the dog to release.<br />
<br />
Aiden just stood their wide-eyed, petrified, not sure what to do or even what to think. This was wrong - so wrong, but he knew when his brother had an idea, no one could talk him out of it.<br />
<br />
Buster panted in bliss with his tail wagging excitedly behind him.  His dog cock steamed in the cool night air as his meaty tip pressed against the hot dog Luke was holding underneath him. Then, he howled. In an instant, a jet of thick doggy splooge shot out of his dick, covering the sausage below in a gooey glaze of canine jizz. Aiden jerked Buster off with his other hand, milking the Doberman for every drop of sperm until those jets of cum trickled down into watery drips.<br />
<br />
Luke pulled back, holding the cum-covered hot dog with care as he made his way back towards Aiden, walking by him back towards their apartment. “’The cursed hot-dog’. How’s that for a video title?” Luke chuckled, his face blushing a bit, “I know it’s weird, but just roll with it. I know this is gonna be the one.”<br />
<br />
Aiden just stood there as his brother passed him. He wanted to say that this was too much – that if this is what he was doing for his videos now – he’d gone too far… but he couldn’t form the words. How turned to follow behind his brother, just hoping that it wouldn’t go any farther than this.<br />
<br />
Aiden got back to their apartment shortly behind Luke, that cum-covered hot dog sitting on a white paper plater on the kitchen table. It looked a little like mayonnaise, the goo thick and slightly off-white, dripping off the tip of the meat, staining the bun below it.<br />
<br />
“Here. We’ve gotta do the video quick.” Luke stepped out from behind Aiden, patting his younger brother on the shoulder while handing him his phone.<br />
<br />
“Luke. You aren’t gonna…” Aiden’s voice jittered, gulping before starting again. “Do you really wanna have people see you eat that…?”<br />
<br />
“Listen, I’ve been looking through TikTok and that OneWithNature trend is really taking off. Videos are getting millions of views – thousands of ad dollars.” Luke explained, listing off a litany of research he did of the topic of eating a dog-cum hot dog on video as he sat down at the table. “This is gonna be it… I can feel it. After this – no more weird videos. After this, I can quit my job at Walmart and make a living as a content creator. But this is as bad as it gets. I promise.”<br />
<br />
Aiden still is having trouble being convinced, looking at his older brother with a queasy look before finally relenting. He held up the phone towards Luke and pressed play, giving his brother the signal to turn on his ‘TikTok’ voice.<br />
<br />
“Hey! LitLuke Naysh comin’ at you with the… WEIRDEST thing I’ve ever done!” Luke declares in the most obnoxious voice imaginable, holding the plate out in front of him for the camera to get a close-up of the hot dog. “This… well, you see when a dog loves a glizzy– you get the ultimate condiment! Now ‘cause of TOS, we’re keeping it on the down-low… but I think ya’ll know what this white stuff is! So – let’s try it - see if this is the thing to take to your 4th of July Cookout!”<br />
<br />
Aiden gagged a little behind the phone, but managed to hold it steady as Luke picked up the bun and held it towards his mouth. There was a moment of hesitation as the salty, metallic smell of dog semen finally hit Luke’s nostrils. Aiden hoped his big brother would come to his senses and put the hot dog down, but unfortunately for him, when Luke had his mind set on something. He was going to do it.<br />
<br />
Opening his mouth wide, Luke quickly thrust the cursed glizzy into his mouth, flecks of dog jizz dripping off the sausage and landing on his tongue. Luke shivered, but didn’t quit, shoving an inch-and-a-half of hot dog in his mouth before biting down, dropping the rest of the hotdog back down on the plate as he desperately chewed the gross piece of food – trying to swallow it as quickly as possible to get it over with fast.<br />
<br />
Aiden could hardly look. A sheen of dog cum covered his brother’s lips as a string of drool started to ooze from his mouth. His chewing slowed, Luke turning his gaze away from the camera and back down towards the half-eaten hot dog… like something he didn’t even expect was happening.<br />
<br />
“Wh-whoa… LitLuke Naysh…” Luke addressed his viewers, his façade as an annoying internet personality faltering. His tongue flicks out, wiping the crumbs of bread and slimy dog cum from his lips, but his tongue didn’t go back inside.<br />
<br />
Luke was starting to pant, his head bobbing up and down a little as his cum-covered tongue hung out of his lips. “It’s like… the God Glizzy…” Luke murmured, looking at the camera with a goofy smile.<br />
<br />
“For real. The GOAT glizzy…” Luke repeated, trying his best to milk his reaction for the audience, taking long pauses in between like he was trying to think really hard about something. Luke had a look of euphoria plastered on his panting face. He did it. He did the thing that was going to make him big. But behind the camera, Aiden looked on in horror, seeing the changes his brother wasn’t unaware of.<br />
<br />
“Forget pink sauce. Dog sauce is gonna be the new thing…” Luke joked as his ears started to stretch into pointed black-fuzzed tips, migrating higher up his head as tawny black fur infected his human skin. His hand perched on the table snapped and cracked, joints popping as bone and cartilage pulled back, shortening his fingers into a dog’s paw. Luke was unaware, looking giddily into the camera as his jeans parted, a short, dark-fuzzed Doberman tail started to peak out from his underwear.<br />
<br />
He did it! It all felt so good! He was gonna be a star! He was a good boy!<br />
<br />
“Best hot dog evuurrrrr…” His voice trailed out in a howl as his vocal cords shifted, silencing his human voice for good as Luke punctuated his point with an excited bark. He leaned his weight forward on his paws, balancing himself on the table as his spine cracked horrifically, shifting him to a quadrupedal stance, assuring his audience he’d never walk on two legs again.<br />
<br />
Aiden stood their wide-eyed, not even flinching as the brother he looked up to was replaced with a handsome Doberman Pinscher. This couldn’t be happening for real. Luke looked so happy and calm, oblivious to what was happening to him even though he was losing his humanity! It wasn’t real… how could it possibly be real?<br />
<br />
The last of Luke’s face vanished underneath a layer of dog fur as his mouth and nose joined into a sharp-looking muzzle, his tongue still happily lolling out as a string of cummy drool dribbled onto the half-eaten hot dog below him. His jeans became too loose, slipping down his rear legs just to reveal that his underside too was ravaged by the changes. His feet were replaced with digitigrade paws, muscular canine haunches taking the place of his thighs as two heavy dark-fuzzed tennis balls sank into Luke’s new bestial scrotum. A fuzzy sheath just like the one he&#39;d been jerking off half-an-hour ago was now glued onto his lower belly, a tapered tip of pink canine love proudly peeking out, drooling out dog lube onto the linoleum kitchen floor.<br />
<br />
“L-luke…” The younger boy stammered behind the phone’s screen as he ended the video, pointing down at Luke. “Y-you’re…”<br />
<br />
The panting dog that had been his brother just moments ago finally looked down. His panting stopped. His wagging tail stopped. The goofy dog smile on his face shifting into a clear expression of confusion. Luke lost his balance, sliding off the table and landing on all fours for the first time, the dog’s mouth agape as he arched his head back to look at his body.<br />
<br />
“You’re a dog…” Aiden shivered, on the brink of tears as he watched his brother come to the realization of what he’s become.<br />
<br />
But then, instead of the breakdown Aiden was expecting, his tail started to wag again. Luke looked up to his brother like a little kid in candy store, strutting in front of Luke like a stud at the Westminster Dog Show as he sat on his haunches and looked up at Aiden with that same panting smile as before.<br />
<br />
“Luke, you’re a dog! THAT’S NOT A GOOD THING IF YOU DIDN&#39;T KNOW!” Aiden shouted at Luke in exasperation, only to elicit an excited bark from the new dog. Luke’s tail wagged even faster, his pink prick slipping further from his sheath as he registered the words “Good” and “Dog” from Aiden.<br />
<br />
Luke hopped up on his hind legs, propping himself up against Aiden as his heavy weight slammed his young brother against the wall behind him. Despite losing some height, Luke was even heavier than he was as a human, his slick canine muscles flexing as he greeted Aiden like his owner just coming back from work, attacking him with a flurry of licks and excited yips. Happy to be a dog.<br />
<br />
“LUKE, STOP!” Aiden gasped as he stood there trapped between a dog and the hard place, his butt getting repeated slammed against the wall as Luke’s loins smash against his belly, that half-out “hot dog” of his kissing Aiden’s belly with slimy spurts of canine love. “YOU’RE A DOG FOR GOD’S SAKES! A DOG…! A DOG…. A dog…”<br />
<br />
Aiden’s voice trails off to a whimper as Luke slammed his little brother repeatedly like a jackhammer, humping his belly with alacrity, increasing his pace every time Aiden called him what he really was now. The former boy was getting off to just hearing that he was an animal. A dog. A dog… a dog…<br />
<br />
Luke howled as cum splattered all over Aiden’s T-shirt, his huge doggy balls happy to treat Luke’s new owner to a hefty load of his puppy love. By the time it was all over, Aiden crumpled do the kitchen floor in a mess of sweat and dog juices. Luke plopped down right on top of him for the night. Satisfied that he was very much a good dog.<br />
<br />
___________________________<br />
<br />
169 million views after a single week.<br />
<br />
Aiden couldn’t believe the number was real, but the royalty checks from dog food advertisements on the video confirmed that Luke was right. That video really was “the one”.<br />
<br />
When he read the number of to Luke, the new Doberman seemed to understand it, as if he’d still retained his social media prowess even after losing his humanity.<br />
<br />
Aiden took control of the LitLuke TikTok account after his brother changed, but Luke was still the star of it. It turned out making viral ‘funny animal’ videos was a lot easier if the animal knew what it was supposed to do. Soon the LitLuke channel was uploading videos daily, ‘Dog climbs on roof’, ‘Dog sings along to Taylor Swift’.<br />
<br />
Luke never lost his acting chops, racking up millions upon millions of views even after the viral video of him turning into a dog. Aiden came to realize that almost all those ‘funny animal’ videos on the internet came from people turned into animals. It was unnerving that so many people choose to change – chose to turn into all sorts of cats, dogs, horses, rats, ferrets, otters, - what have you - giving away their human selves just to live the life of a pet.<br />
<br />

<br />
“Luke. Dinner.” Aiden gave an unenthusiastic call to his brother, beckoning into the kitchen as the excited dog dove into a bowl full of kibble. Luke took to being a dog better than Aiden did to being a dog owner. Taking his former brother for walks… feeding him… treating him like a pet. It was just something the young boy just couldn’t get used to…<br />
<br />
Aiden slunk out of the kitchen, plopping onto the living room couch as he scrolled through Netflix for something to take his mind off this. As he did, Luke sauntered into right after finishing his meal, his new collar jingling and his tail wagging as the big Doberman hopped up on the couch, covering his owner in his huge, muscular doggy body.<br />
<br />
“Luke. Stop.” Aiden whimpered, his voice muffled under his brother’s fur, but that was enough to get Luke to get up and pull away, the dog looking at him with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Aiden just lay there for a few moments, realizing his brother heard him – realizing his brother was obeying him like a pet dog would. He wasn’t used to that. Luke really was playing the role of pet.<br />
<br />
The boy sat up, looking at his new dog sadly, wishing he had his brother back… but he knew that wasn’t going to happen. Luke wanted this, and when he had his mind set on something – there just wasn’t any changing it. And as long as Luke was happy, he was happy just be with him.<br />
<br />
“O-okay.” Aiden gave in as he opened his arms wide as if asking for a hug. Luke couldn’t hug Aiden like his owner wanted, so he did what he could, pouncing back atop the boy, gripping him in his forepaws, spooning Aiden with his huge canine body. Aiden gasped out another muffled huff as he felt doggy fur wrap around him, the boy shivering as the dog’s heat radiated against him. It felt good.<br />
<br />
No, he wasn’t his brother anymore. He was his dog.<br />
<br />
Aiden lifted an arm around the dog that was spooning him and hugged him back.<br />
<br />
“Good dog.”</p>
