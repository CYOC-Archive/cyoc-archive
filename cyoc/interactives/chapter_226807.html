<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi looked at herself in the mirror, she looked at her hair, her eyes, her body, everything. Ever since she came home today she couldn&#39;t help but wonder what part of her was wrong that Steven wouldn&#39;t even hesitate to reject her.<br />
<br />
After thinking about it for a couple of minutes it was clear to her, so Naomi decisively took the wand and waved it strongly in front of her, if Steven didn&#39;t like what she was now, then she just had to change everything.<br />
<br />
Yukiko immediately appeared in front of her, fluttered a little and said<br />
<br />
—Wow, that was fast, the first wish usually takes a little more thought, but from what I see you are very determined<br />
<br />
—Yes, I am very sure. Yukiko, please change my body to one that Steven can&#39;t reject, make it completely irresistible to him. I don&#39;t care what shape you give me as long as you let me make him mine it it will be fine<br />
<br />
—Mmm, are you sure you don&#39;t care what form you take? We could talk a little about that...<br />
<br />
—I&#39;m sure, please Yukiko, do it.<br />
<br />
—Okay, here I go...<br />
<br />
Then Yukiko moved her own small wand, it emitted a light quite strong for her small size, then that light detached itself from her wand and like a small orb it approached Naomi&#39;s chest and embedded itself inside her.<br />
<br />
Naomi could only be excited to finally have what it takes to win Steven&#39;s heart, she then began searching all over her body to see what changes would occur.<br />
<br />
At the beginning she didn&#39;t feel or see anything, she was about to complain to Yukiko who was looking at her a little worried, but suddenly she felt something, a vertigo flooded her out of nowhere, everything around her started to spin a little, she felt like she was losing a little balance, at the same time she felt as if everything was getting smaller around him and she also felt further from the ground. For about five minutes she stayed like that until everything became stable again. To check what she had changed she turned to look again at the full-length mirror that she had in front of her, however, when she turned around she found that her head could no longer be reflected in it, Naomi was bigger than the mirror! <br />
<br />
Without any way to measure herself, she could only estimate something close to 2 meters, maybe 190cm or 195cm. Compared to her former height it was a gigantic change, and Naomi already had an idea why Steven hadn&#39;t accepted her in the first place, she was too short! But really all she was missing was her height?<br />
<br />
She was thinking about that when she felt a strange sensation in her body, she felt something similar to being inflated, she turned to look at her arms and they seemed harder, stronger.<br />
<br />
Before she could tear all of her clothes into oblivion, Naomi decided to take everything off of her, this way she could also observe her changes in detail.<br />
<br />
Going back to what she could see on his body, Naomi could tell that it was her muscles growing, she was getting very strong, maybe not as strong as a box fighter but looking in the mirror she could say that she looked like a clothing model... But a male clothing model, does Steven like somewhat more masculine girls? It was definitely a quality that normal Naomi didn&#39;t have, but a small bad feeling began to form.<br />
<br />
Her muscles continued to grow until her entire body had grown, she was hard all over, very strong, even a shy six pack had appeared on her abdomen, even her neck began to get bigger and bigger, thicker. It wasn&#39;t until Naomi saw an Adam&#39;s apple appear in her throat that she didn&#39;t realize what was happening, she was transforming into a man!<br />
<br />
She let out a small moan of surprise that was muffled by Naomi herself to avoid waking everyone up, but without a doubt the voice she heard was a deep man&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Naomi couldn&#39;t believe it, Steven was gay! That was why he had rejected her so quickly. She turned to look at Yukiko immediately but as soon as they exchanged glances Yukiko quickly said<br />
<br />
—I tried to warn you! But you seemed very sure so I didn&#39;t insist... Sorry! It&#39;s my first job! Please do not hate me!<br />
<br />
Before Naomi could wish herself back to normal, Yukiko ran away from her, leaving her alone.<br />
<br />
Shocked, Naomi continued to look in the mirror for new changes. She turned to look at her hands, now they were big and thick, masculine, out of the corner of her eye she also looked at how her small and tender feet grew proportionally to her new size, perhaps double or a little more than the original size. She felt her feminine curves become less and less pronounced and her hair slowly returned to her head.<br />
<br />
She was at it when she felt a strange sensation in her crotch.<br />
<br />
—No, no, no, no, please!<br />
<br />
He quickly checked what the situation was down there. Helpless, Naomi only watch as her vagina transformed into a protuberance that increasingly resembled a penis, growing to levels that Naomi did not consider healthy. Just seeing it in her mirror felt inappropriate, Naomi didn&#39;t know what to feel not only to see it but to know that that thing was now part of her.<br />
<br />
At this point she looked somewhat comical, he was like a muscular man with a snake between his legs, but his breasts and his tender woman&#39;s face were still there. Naomi was just thinking about laughing so as not to cry when she felt a tingling in her breasts and on his cheeks.<br />
<br />
As best she could, she sat on the floor to watch what she thought would be the last part of her transformation and she got as close to the mirror as she could. She saw how what was once her great pride, her D cup breasts, the largest in her family, shrank until they were forgotten, her nipples also shrank and became slightly less sensitive, even so, compared to what her male friends had told her, they were still quite sensitive. Also, although his breasts could no longer be called female breasts, his pecs protruded a little, this time hard and firm. Making him a complete man.<br />
<br />
Something that caught her by surprise was feeling how she rose a little higher in her place, sitting in her place she inspected a little and discovered that her buttocks had grown and were even a little bigger and juicier than when she was a woman.<br />
<br />
Finally Naomi looked at her face, she saw how little by little her feminine features were disappearing, her chin became more square, her nose a little bigger but not too much, her cheekbones moved a little bit. Her small imperfections were also disappearing, her eyes changed to a bright green color and she saw how her hair, which although it was already dark, took on inhumanly black tones, completely black. Naomi admitted that her new face was extremely attractive, although she would have preferred to see this face on her partner, not on herself.<br />
<br />
Defeated, Naomi waited for some other change but she felt nothing more. She stood up and began to look at herself again, she, now he, was extremely attractive in every way, he would surely be hired for any role in a movie or as a model in any magazine.<br />
<br />
Still, Naomi didn&#39;t know what to do, he looked at her clothes on the floor, no joke they wouldn&#39;t fit again. Naomi looked around her room, everything looked so small now...<br />
<br />
Then Naomi felt a sensation of vertigo again, the change was not over....</p>
