<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason was so absorbed in his problem he didn&#39;t hear the front door open and close, or the fact he was standing in the bathroom, with the door open in full view of part of the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good, you&#39;re home. I wanted to ask if yo... HOLY SHIT!&quot; The yell snapped Jason out of his thoughts and he turned to see his roommate David staring right at him with a mix of fear and awe. David and Jason shared certain fetishes, actually they had met on a furry website, discovered they lived in the same city and decided to become roommates after a while. Also, after a night of too many beers they figured out they were both bi. They fooled around occasionally, but only when one or the other wasn&#39;t dating someone. Friends, roommates with benefits.<br />
<br />
And right now David was looking at him like the Holy Grail. &quot;Dude?! What the fuck happened to you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it down..&quot; Jason hissed. The walls in their apartment building weren&#39;t the thickest things in the world. &quot;Would you believe a witch&#39;s curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d believe anything right now.&quot; David came closer. Were Jason was slim, David was more buff, and the way he was dressed right now he had come from the gym. Actually, Jason could smell the musky odor of David&#39;s sweat, it wasn&#39;t that David was dirty, this new nose he was growing was just stronger than his old one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Witch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lena. She found my stash of furry porn and um.. got a little upset.&quot; Jason motioned to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;No shit... Can I touch it?&quot; David was looking at Jason&#39;s swollen dog cock. He hadn&#39;t realized it went rigid again, ready for another go. He wanted to say no, he knew touching could lead to fooling around and that would just make his problem worse. Instead he found himself nodding as he leaned back against the bathroom sink. Why was he agreeing? It was like he couldn&#39;t stop himself.<br />
<br />
David reached out and placed his hand on Jason&#39;s cock. &quot;So. That&#39;s what it feels like.&quot; Jason knew David wouldn&#39;t be able to resist, and when the stroking started he just braced himself. He tried to break free, tried to move his arm to push David away, to tell him no. But all that came out was a low, deep moan.<br />
<br />
Then David was getting on his knees, opening his mouth. There was no way a whole foot of canine cock was going to fit in David&#39;s mouth, but soon he was taking as much of it as he could, his lips pressed up against the small bulge that would become Jason&#39;s knot soon if David didn&#39;t stop. But he was good with his tongue, and soon had Jason leaning back and practically panting.<br />
<br />
It was like being in a movie, where you wanted to yell at the character on screen for doing something obviously stupid but of course your yelling would change anything. Except the yelling was inside Jason&#39;s mind, and his body was the character on the screen. Stop! You&#39;re going to make it worse! And Jason just grabbed the back of David&#39;s head with his hand, giving little thrusts to help him along, his knot plumping up.<br />
<br />
Jason resisted the instinctual urge to shove that not in David&#39;s mouth, tying him like he would a bitch in heat. Instead he moaned deep and low as his seed flooded David&#39;s mouth, he drank down every last bit. Then control returned to Jason and all he could say was, &quot;Shit, shit, shit... Cumming makes the changes worse!&quot; It was like control of his own body was suddenly restored.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! Why didn&#39;t you stop me?&quot; David looked guilty up at Jason then sprung to his feet. &quot;I.. I thought you were enjoying that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did... I just couldn&#39;t stop myself, it was like auto-pilot.&quot; David pushed off the sink as he felt a sudden tingling at the base of his spine. He knew exactly what that was. A nub appeared above his ass, and quickly grew long and whip like, fluffy black fur growing up and down the length of his new tail in a blink. Below his waist more of the black fur was growing in, spreading from the patch around his sheath and balls. As it flowed down his legs he lost his balance and David luckily caught him before he could smash his head on the toilet.<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s legs were twisting and bending, his feet reshaping into massive paws. And David was getting off on it judging by the tent pushing out the front of his sweatpants. He felt his muzzle pushing out a bit more, a blurry lump in the middle of his field of vision. Lastly, the patch of fur in the middle of his chest spread, a line growing down his stomach to meet this furry lower half. He sighed as he felt the changes stop and shook himself, getting his balance on his own two feet.. paws. It was a weird sensation standing on paws, but not uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit..&quot; David breathed out, looking Jason up and down. &quot;How many?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was number three..&quot; Jason sighed experimenting walking on his paws a few steps.<br />
<br />
&quot;At that rate I&#39;d say one or two more and you&#39;ll be done changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.. I need to get in touch with Lena as soon as possible, but she&#39;s not returning my calls.&quot; Jason picked up his phone from the sink and looked at it, still nothing. Maybe texting.. He started tapping something out as David leaned back against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel.. weird.&quot; David muttered.<br />
<br />
Jason looked up from the text he was tapping out to look at David. He was still sporting a boner from either fooling around or watching Jason change but otherwise.. no.. that bulge was bigger. Jason reached out and tugged down David&#39;s sweat pants. It was hard alright, it was also almost the size of Jason&#39;s. A full nine inches standing at attention. Jason had fooled around with David to know he wasn&#39;t that big.. in fact David had always been on the smaller side, only five inches before. As his balls looked like a couple of oranges in a bag. They were huge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; It was all Jason could muster.<br />
<br />
David looked down at his own cock with that same mix of fear and awe. &quot;You didn&#39;t say it was contagious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know!&quot; Jason quickly started texting Lena, telling her the curse is spreading to other people. Maybe that would get her attention.<br />
<br />
The skin of David&#39;s cock was becoming darker as it kept growing. Seeing it next to his own cock Jason was surprised to see it was getting even bigger than his foot long monster. &quot;That&#39;s.. different.&quot;<br />
<br />
David reached out to grab a hold of it, he could even wrap his hand around the shaft anymore. &quot;Fuck, it&#39;s so heavy it hurts.&quot; The skin was now a deep brown, and the head of his cock was flattening out into a blunt tip. Once the medial ring appeared half way down the shaft both Jason and David looked at each other, they both knew what that was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horse.&quot; David said..<br />
<br />
&quot;Or at least equine.. Could be a zebra for all we know how this works..&quot; Jason&#39;s phone dinged, a message coming through from Lena.<br />
<br />
&#39;Impossible, I didn&#39;t make it to spread.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jason quickly snapped a picture of David&#39;s cock, his own doggy one in the frame for extra proof and sent it.<br />
<br />
&#39;Shit..&#39; And that was the only response. &quot;I hope that means she&#39;s on her way.&quot;<br />
<br />
David was sighing in relief, though it was because a sheathe was growing in around the base of his cock, anchoring it to his stomach and taking some of the weight of the pendulous member off of his crotch. As the skin of his towering shaft finished turning a deep ebony, short grey fur started growing in over his sheathe and balls. Balls that were pulling up and suddenly churning.<br />
<br />
Jason reached out and grabbed David by the shoulders, spinning him to face the open shower just in time for his cock to blast load after load of musky cum right into the tiled shower stall. From a quick glance, Jason guessed it must be at least sixteen inches long. Lena&#39;s magic had some potency. Or she had a twisted mind. But slowly it softened and slid back inside that newly formed sheath. Sure, it still hung like a massive sack off of David&#39;s stomach, those heavy balls not looking any more comfortable to be carrying around, but at least the thing had subsided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try not to touch it, or think about it, or anything. Hopefully Lena will get here soon.&quot; Jason looked at his phone with a sigh. &quot;Hopefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
David grabbed some toilet paper to clean himself up, running the shower to send his spunk down the drain. &quot;Why? This is our dream, dude! We could share it, and we wouldn&#39;t be the only ones!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because..&quot; Jason started. &quot;We don&#39;t know how far it will go, what happens if it keeps spreading...&quot;<br />
<br />
David pulled his sweatpants back over his cock. It looked like he was smuggling something in them, but at least it was out of sight. It wasn&#39;t a bad idea, if he kept walking around the house naked him and David would probably start fooling around again, and if neither of them could stop themselves like he couldn&#39;t stop the blow job, well, he didn&#39;t want to think about it.<br />
<br />
Jason sighed and went back to his own room, digging for something to wear. Pants were out of the question, but a pair of basketball shorts fit him well enough, followed by a loose tank top that didn&#39;t ruffle his chest fur too badly. David was pacing the living room when he came back out, then the doorbell rang and they both stared at each other.</p>
