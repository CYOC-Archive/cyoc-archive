<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All of the other participants took their place in line before you, but that was fine <br />
because you weren't sure what you wanted. You thought crocs were cool, but you also <br />
liked lions, and you loved the sound of peacocks crowing. By the time you were next in <br />
line, the only openings left were one lion and one croc. Whatever the girl in front of <br />
you picked would decide where you were sleeping tonight.<br />
&quot;I'll take the lions,&quot; she told the ticket man. <br />
&quot;Good choice! I've always been fond of the lions myself.&quot; Then he looked at you and <br />
said,&quot;Well it looks as though you get to sleep in the crocodile pit! Don't worry, though, <br />
big Cheryl's a lover, not a biter. 'Less of course your a fish! Haha!&quot;<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; you say. Crocodiles had always been your favorite animals. The ticket guy <br />
handed you a zoo map and showed you where to go. Walking along the neat, trimmed <br />
pathways, you looked at the card he gave you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dear participant:<br />
<br />
Please report to the crocodile enclosure at 10:00PM. You will receive a chance to <br />
meet our crocodile, Cheryl, up close and personal as soon as the sun sets. Please <br />
leave any food you may have brought outside of the pen.<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
The Central Zoo Staff<br />
<br />
<br />
It was only 7:00, so you decided to kill some time and check out the exhibits on the <br />
way to the croc pen. By the time ten-o'-clock rolled around, you had only explored half <br />
of the marine section of the zoo. You arrived at the pit right on time and a young man <br />
in the zoo uniform of a dark green polo shirt and khaki shorts stood by the access <br />
door. <br />
&quot;Hello, Sir,&quot; he greeted you,&quot;Tonight you will get to meet a crocodile like no one else <br />
before. Do you have any food item?&quot; You gave him your bag of chips. &quot;Any spare <br />
articles of clothing?&quot; None. &quot;Any metal objects like keys or change?&quot; You handed him <br />
your key chain and a few coins. &quot;Alright then! Now, I'll show you to the croc, but I <br />
must warn you, she doesn't like clothes for some reason. If you wear them, she'll rip <br />
them off. So to prevent her from accidentally hurting you, you'll need to take off your <br />
clothes. Don't worry, I won't watch. But before that, you'll need to take this shot to <br />
prevent you from getting any diseases from the animal.&quot; He pulled out a syring filled <br />
with a white liquid. He stuck the needle into your arm and emptied the syringe. You <br />
took off your clothes and he opened the pen for you. <br />
&quot;Aren't you coming in?&quot; you ask. <br />
&quot;Oh no, I'll stay out here and monitor your relationship with Cheryl. But if anything <br />
goes wrong, I'll come in and help.&quot;<br />
It didn't sound very reassuring, but how many people could say that they slept with a <br />
crocodile? You entered the pen and the attendant shut the door behind you. You <br />
walked for a little bit and came face to face with the biggest croc you've ever seen. <br />
She must have been 25 feet long and as thick as a tractor tire. She was huge! She <br />
quickly crawled over to you and sniffed you. Apparently finding you suitable, she came <br />
closer and wrapped herself around your legs. Then she laid down and started to hum <br />
in happiness. You found it quite surprising, but sta down and laid your head against <br />
her huge body. You sat there a few more minutes in the mud surrounded by a giant <br />
croc, when you suddenly started to feel strange. <br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; you called out,&quot;I don't feel well, should I come out?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the guy's voice came over a PA system,&quot;It's probably just the shot, it'll wear off <br />
soon. But it didn't. It got worse and worse, a burning feeling in your gut. The it took <br />
over your entire body. You were in so much pain you fell backwards onto the big croc's <br />
tail. Suddenly, the burning turned to searing pain. You looked at yourself and found <br />
that your skin was completely white. But wait, it wasn't skin, it was...scales! You felt <br />
your body stretch and grow until the huge croc seemed smaller than you. You must <br />
have been 30 feet long and wider than the croc you were laying on. Then your arms <br />
and legs shortened to half their size while your hands and feet became huge claws as <br />
big as a dinner plate. Your rear exploded in pain as a powerful tail 10 feet long and 3 <br />
feet wide burst from your back. Your body became flatter as ridges grew up your back. <br />
Finally, your now huge head also flattened and stretched into a snout filled with sharp <br />
teeth and big tongue. Your eyes closed and opened, your vision becoming sharper, <br />
while your ears dissappeared into your head. You rolled over onto your stomach and <br />
crawled away from the other, now smaller, croc. You looked into the water and saw a <br />
huge albino crocodile staring back at you. You tried to scream, but all that came out <br />
was an angry hiss. <br />
&quot;Sorry, man,&quot; came the attendant's voice,&quot;But how did you think we breed such rare <br />
animals do fast. By the time your done tonight, a whole nest of albino crocs will be <br />
hatching and ready to sell! But don't worry; once mating season is over, we'll erase <br />
your memory and send you back as if nothing ever happened.&quot; You hissed in <br />
response. &quot;Don't try to fight it, your instincts are too powerful!&quot;<br />
And they were. The female had slid up next to you and was now getting into the water. <br />
Against your will, you did the same. She floated there, waiting, while you mounted her. <br />
Your huge reptilian cock emerged from its hiding place and hardened as you stuck it <br />
into her waiting sex. It was an enourmous piece of croc meat at about 3 feet long and <br />
6 inches wide. You thrust into her and held your position, pleasure building up inside of <br />
you. You thrust again and again, each time faster and harder. Finally, you reach <br />
climax, spilling gallons of croc seed into Cheryl's womb from your softball size testicles. <br />
She crawled onto the beach to lay down and you slowly followed suit. Forgetting your <br />
human life and wondering now about your children on the way.</p>
