<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel opened up the box to find a button up plaid shirt, some blue jeans, a hat and some cowboy boots. She held up the shirt to her chest just to see how big it was. &quot;This isn&#39;t what I ordered...&quot; she complained.<br />
<br />
Kyle let out a bit of a laugh. &quot;It&#39;s alright babe. That looks about my size so I could probably wear it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You think?&quot; But she was already pulling off her own shirt and replaced it with the plaid one. &quot;I don&#39;t know... I think it looks pretty good on me...&quot; she smiled. The shirt was far too large and was constantly trying to fall off her thin rounded shoulders. Even as she buttoned some of the bottom buttons up. Her perfectly round breasts were still exposed. &quot;You don&#39;t think it looks good?&quot; she taunted, throwing the hat on her head and twisting the bill behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; Kyle smirked as he realized what she was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; she played back. &quot;I think I look great. I got you a present too. It&#39;s in on your bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Kyle was intrigued. &quot;Should I go get it now?&quot; his dick was already hard. And she looked like she was in the mood. With just a bite of her bottom lip, Kyle took it as a yes. &quot;Then I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked back to his room wondering what she could have possibly gotten him. Normally all the toys they would have played with would have just been for her, but if she found something online for him he couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it could possibly be. It had to be something wild as even within the few weeks he&#39;d known her, she&#39;d shown him all kinds of wild new moves that made sex feel like nothing he&#39;d ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
On the bed was a small box addressed to him. She&#39;d even wrapped it in a bow. He quickly opened it but was confused as to what he saw. &quot;The fuck?&quot; he pulled out a small pink set of underwear that wasn&#39;t even as thick as his leg. Kyle examined it wondering what kind of joke she was playing. Did she purposefully switch the boxes to make it more interesting?  &quot;Yeah a joke...&quot; he laughed to himself wondering how he could even get them on.<br />
<br />
But in the other room he could hear the loud boots starting towards his bedroom door. &#39;Is she actually wearing all of it?&#39; Kyle asked himself as the footsteps came closer and closer to the door. But then the door opened. &quot;Ray?&quot; Kyle asked as the person he was dating stood in the doorway. For some reason it didn&#39;t quite look right. His shirt was still a little big on him and the jeans looked like they were threatening to fall at any moment. But maybe it was just that he was wearing sunglasses in the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup babe,&quot; he cocked his head back. &quot;You like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like it?&quot; Kyle wondered if he meant the panties. &quot;I&#39;m not...&quot; he stared a bit perplexed as he watched Ray&#39;s body slowly grow more and more into the shirt and jeans he was wearing. They didn&#39;t sag as much and his muscular pecs pushed at his shirt. Ray loved keeping several of the top buttons unbuttoned to show off the deep cut between his pecs and the top couple sets of his abs. The bottom of the shirt was usually still tucked in but right now only half of it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon babe,&quot; Ray stepped further into the room. &quot;You&#39;ve done so much for me. Why can&#39;t I do something for you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just... I just...&quot; something deep inside Kyle&#39;s mind was starting to warp. He could feel his minds slowly starting to change. Part of him was enjoying this. And it scared him. &quot;I just need to...&quot; he headed for the door but Ray caught him by the collar. Despite Kyle&#39;s impressive size and strength he was stopped dead in his tracks. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon babe... I already turned off the stove. The food can get a little cold. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll still taste just as good,&quot; Ray pulled Kyle into him giving him a few light kisses.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t know what was going on. He always thought he was taller. But now they were the same height. &#39;He&#39;s taller!&#39; the thought shot through his mind. &quot;What&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh...&quot; Ray kissed the side of his face and held his body tightly against Kyle&#39;s. His strong body easily manhandled the other man as he rocked him back and forth in his strong embrace. Deep cuts ran through his hands as they grew more calloused and rough. &quot;I&#39;ve had such a hard day at work and you take such good care of me. I just want to take care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; <br />
<br />
Ray shushed him again by putting their mouths together. Kyle&#39;s body naturally accepted the kiss. Inside he was screaming at himself that this was wrong. But the pleasure and satisfaction from the embrace was telling him to keep going. He could feel his hard dick sticking straight out in front of him, throbbing with an unbelievable amount of joy.<br />
<br />
With a light shove, Kyle found his body bouncing on the bed. The former 300 pound linebacker was rapidly shrinking in on itself. The large bulky muscles he&#39;d spent years growing were rapidly shrinking. Ray stood stood over him, a good head taller than he had been just moments ago. His large masculine body leaned down and pulled off the oversized shorts down Kyle&#39;s thin legs, releasing the dick pointing straight up.<br />
<br />
The average 6 inches was slowly starting to pull back as well. But the sensitivity only seemed to go up. As Ray gave it a light peck on the head, Kyle&#39;s body bucked with joy. He tried his best to contain his excitement but feeling Ray&#39;s lips against it&#39;s head was just too much. The 4 inches lost another and then another while Ray continued to pleasure the much smaller man beneath him. The thick bristles of his beard only added to the sensation as the tiny 2 inches barely pushed out of his body at all. <br />
<br />
Ray smiled down at his boyfriend as he could feel the joy packed within his tiny body. Watching him squirm in delight as he continued to please him was just too much. His own was aching hard in his jeans. It ran down his leg close to his knee. He knew it was a bit selfish of him but seeing just how much Kyle was struggling to keep from cumming he figured that it might be okay. Dropping his jeans around his ankles he fished out the massive cock and pressed it against Kyle&#39;s anus.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-m-more,&quot; Kyle begged as his legs went over Ray&#39;s shoulders. <br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t much more Ray needed to know to push deeper inside. He could feel his cock wrapped around that tight anus that seemed designed just for him. The large thick rod easily slid in but felt enough resistance that it was all the more amazing. He watched as Kyle squirmed in his grasp as feeling the sensation run deeper inside him. Hearing his soft whimpers of pleasure was too much. He felt his body buck hard into Kyle&#39;s, unloading the massive load stored up inside his colossal balls. Several heavy loads sprayed into his anus filling him up.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Kyle&#39;s own had exploded onto the shirt he was wearing. It was just a few pathetic squirts but it felt like the world was colliding. His eyes fluttered and then slowly came back down to earth as he watched Ray&#39;s masculine body pull out from inside him. He instantly ran for the bathroom, too afraid of the mess he might make if he didn&#39;t make it quickly enough. There were a few drops that went into his shorts but Kyle was great at holding the flood gates closed.</p>
