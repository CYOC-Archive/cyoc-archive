<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s note: I&#39;m making a few changes to the details. Her shirt only has a few buttons, and they&#39;re metallic.)<br />
<br />
As she tried to slip the phone in her back pocket, she was met with unexpected resistance. Sure, sometimes she had worn skinny jeans, but her butt had never interfered with her phone&#39;s usual home. She tried a little harder to push it in without much luck. It was as if the pocket was sealed shut! But Jennifer knew these *were* the jeans that had pockets in the back. Flustered, she titled the phone on its corner and rubbed it along the pocket&#39;s opening, looking for a spot that her phone would fit. The exertion was making her pant, and her face felt warm.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, the phone slipped in with a slimy sound. Jennifer&#39;s right knee buckled, as her leg experienced an orgasm quite unlike anything that she had ever achieved herself. Then, without warning, the phone buzzed as a text message came in. Jennifer squirmed in ecstasy. Then she realized what had happened. She immediately pulled the phone out, but the stimulation pushed her even further over the edge. Her back pocket retorted by briefly shooting a thin stream of sticky cum at her phone. <br />
<br />
As she calmed down from her discovery, she frustratedly sighed at the reality of things. She would either have to get used to fucking herself every time she wanted to store something in what was essentially a moist vagina, or she&#39;d have to carry a purse. So she opted for the latter, as annoying as it would be.  Jennifer gathered her personal belongings in her purse, slung her backpack over her other shoulder, and left for school.<br />
<br />
Aside from getting used to her much larger pair of breasts (if you could even call the suggestively filled shirt breasts), the day wasn&#39;t very eventful for Jennifer. She carefully avoided putting things in her pockets. Her nipples really annoyed her though. Thanks to the buttons, they were perpetually stiff and cold. Sure, they weren&#39;t affected by the wind, but she felt like she had constantly exposed nipple piercings. On the plus side, she found that a perk of the curse was that she no longer had *anything* between her legs. Her whole life she had been conditioned and trained to keep her legs closed defensively. Of course, if a lady wears a short skirt or a dress, she risks giving a free peep show to anyone paying attention. So for the first time in class, she sat back with her legs spread wide. And nobody batted an eye. It was one of the most relaxing feelings she had experienced since the start of the curse. But she still felt the reassuring pressure of her vagina staying closed, thanks to the tightness of her pockets.<br />
<br />
As school let out, she felt a familiar pressure build up in her midsection. Her mind raced. On top of everything else Kyle had said, she couldn&#39;t imagine how she was supposed to use the bathroom in her current condition. Sure, her pants had a zipper that would supposedly reveal a vagina, but what of the rest of her pockets? Did they have individual working urethras? As she made a bee-line for the bathroom, her mind raced. Meanwhile the pressure was mounting. What would happen if she didn&#39;t make it in time?<br />
<br />
She swiftly navigated to a stall, closing and locking the door behind her as she began to examine her pants. The pressure didn&#39;t feel as if it were trying to divert to her sides, though she suspected she&#39;d explode in a shower of piss if she didn&#39;t figure out what she was supposed to do next. She examined the crotch of her pants. She noticed the button and the zipper. Instinctually she gripped the button and tried to remove the pants. Not only could she not fit her thumb between the waist and what would normally be her skin, but the button just sent a shiver of pleasure rippling across the seam of the jeans.<br />
<br />
She let go of the button like an electrified buzzer, and instead gripped the zipper. She slowly pulled it down, and as it fully opened she felt a relief. It felt like her vagina had been pressurized behind the zipper, and opening it allowed it to ooze out a little.<br />
<br />
As she examined her new opening, she realized that this vagina was misplaced. Normally, it sat directly between her legs. However, this one was more predominantly pushed up her crotch, lined up with her jeans&#39; zipper. <br />
<br />
She quickly came to the conclusion that simply sitting down to relieve herself probably wouldn&#39;t be an effective way to avoid ruining her clothe-skin. So, she straddled the toilet, facing the wall instead of the stall door. Not a moment too soon, as her bladder had finally had enough and began its release. As she felt the pleasure of relief, she began to feel a slight moisture build around her button-nipples. Looking down, she noticed that she had begun a steady drip of lactation from the thread holes on the tips of the buttons. She frantically clutched for toilet paper, holding it up to her drippy nips and drying the milk that had already moistened the area around them.<br />
<br />
As she tried to keep herself cleaned up, she began to feel a bit flustered and warm. Perhaps it was a culmination of everything, but considering the bathroom was locked and she was alone, she began to play with her freed vagina. As she fondled her breasts with napkins, she used an alternating hand to begin playing with her zipper cunt. <br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed was that it was a little more pliable than her usual vagina. It was as if it wasn&#39;t completely attached, but yet it didn&#39;t just pull off or act differently. However, she could grab a handful of it and it would scrunch up like cloth.<br />
<br />
As her buttons stopped lactating, she had another hand free to work her other openings. She began rubbing her pockets, and stuffing her fist in. One hand on her buzzer, and one fucking a pocket, she reached a screaming orgasm that caused her to black out for a moment.<br />
<br />
As much as she wanted to spend all day playing with her pussy pants, she began cleaning up after she came-to. As she tried to zip up her pussy, she felt a sharp pinch as one of the lips got caught in the zipper. She sighed, unzipped it, grabbed a handful of pussy and pushed it further away from the zipper. As she zipped it up, she felt the mildly uncomfortably tight feeling of her vagina pressing against its zipper. She finished washing up, and left for home.</p>
