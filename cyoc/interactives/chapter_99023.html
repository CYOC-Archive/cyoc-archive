<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arrangements were made and Chad was shipped to the next college. Brad gave Chad a last hug before they closed the crate.<br />
<br />
A young man said, &quot;That was awesome. Why aren&#39;t you turning him back into a human so you can make him a statue again at the next intercollegiate fair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should do that. I could do that but the process is expensive. Besides, some scientists wanted to examine Chad while he was a statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea but the next intercollegiate fair won&#39;t be as impressive because you won&#39;t be able to show the transformation. He&#39;ll already be a statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve thought about statufying myself but someone needs to be able to answer questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you statufy yourself? I mean wouldn&#39;t you be stuck without any way to reverse it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could set the device to auto reverse at a certain time. I&#39;d still like someone I could trust to guard the device but I&#39;d like to give it a try some time. Chad seemed to enjoy it. But I have to stay flesh so I can talk to the other scientists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want another volunteer, someone you can transform at the next science fair? How about me? I&#39;ll be your volunteer.<br />
<br />
Brad looked at this young man, he was a little small but he was packed with muscles. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh brother, it&#39;s bad enough having Brad and Chad. Brad, Chad and Tad is overdoing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t help it. That&#39;s what my parents named me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A little later Brad met another man. &quot;Are you the scientist that turned a human into a statue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Dan Eltrump. I saw the demonstration but was too busy at the time to talk to you. It&#39;s an amazing device but how are you planning to make money with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought it all out yet. I wasn&#39;t trying to make statues. I just discovered this quantum feature by accident. I know that scientists will be impressed even if they don&#39;t know what to do with it and they&#39;ll give me grant money to see what other kinds of devices I might come up with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a better idea. It&#39;s entertainment. I know a lot of men who would love to watch a man be changed into a statue. They would pay you well just to see your demonstration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan explained how much money Brad could make and Brad agreed. &quot;You could make even more money if you demonstrated on two people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know where I could get a second person. I&#39;ll ask around.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, Brad couldn&#39;t find anymore volunteers. Tad agreed but he was the only one available. The day of the demonstration Brad asked, &quot;It&#39;s just for the demonstration and then the statues can be restored, right? You don&#39;t want to study the statues afterward?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not scientists. This is like watching a magic show for us. We just want to see the magic, nothing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Brad decided he&#39;d be the second volunteer. It was a good excuse to try out statufication himself and he&#39;d still be able to make the next science fair on schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad and Tad showed up at the location. It was a private mansion and it felt like a party for the upper class with everyone dressed up in their most elegant clothes sipping champagne and eating caviar. Brad had never been in a place so luxuriously furnished. He felt underdressed then laughed as he realized he would soon be even more underdressed. Dan led Brad and Tad to a stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering if you hadn&#39;t picked a pose already, might I suggest you two pose as wrestlers in a nelson hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d want us to pose separately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be boring. I thought of the idea of a second person because people so rarely get to see two models doing anything together. I wasn&#39;t thinking about a wrestling pose until I saw your friend here. He looks like a wrestler all small and bulging with muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose but I don&#39;t know what a nelson hold is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The show started and Brad gave a brief explanation of what they were about to do. Then it was time to strip. Tad didn&#39;t have any problem stripping naked in front of everyone. Brad specifically brought a long shirt so that he could cover his modesty for as long as possible but he still felt uncomfortable getting naked from the waist down. Per Dan&#39;s instructions, Brad knelt down on all fours and Tad knelt behind him. Then the device activated.<br />
<br />
It did feel pleasant. Brad knew why Chad had relaxed more and more during his statufication process. As the statufication crept up his body, the parts of him that were statue felt really nice. Then he felt something poking him. Brad whispered, &quot;Tad, you&#39;ve got an erection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, this feels even better than I thought it would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re ruining the statue. You didn&#39;t tell me you were gay but please get your thoughts under control. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re here for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;<br />
<br />
The statufication moved up their legs but Tad&#39;s erection wasn&#39;t going down. &quot;It&#39;s about to hit our waist. We better pose our upper bodies in this nelson pose now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad put his arms under Brad&#39;s arms and then got firm grip on the back of Brad&#39;s neck before jerking him into a nelson hold. Tad&#39;s erection slammed into Brad&#39;s hole. The combination of Brad being caught off guard and the statufication opened Brad up and Tad&#39;s cock slammed inside. Brad gasped and just at that instant, their hips became solid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You @^$%#$@. You did that on purpose and I can&#39;t reverse the process in the middle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad didn&#39;t want to admit it but the statufication made it feel good. He didn&#39;t feel any pain. He only felt the pleasure and that meant even having Tad&#39;s cock inside him felt pleasurable.<br />
<br />
The process had been set for eight hours, much faster than what Chad experienced but still fairly slow. Brad still had several more hours to go as a partial statue.<br />
<br />
Guest had been coming up and asking if they could touch. Brad said no but Tad said yes. So the guests touched Tad, tentatively at first but then more openly as they got used to it. They also got more sexually suggestive the later it got.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so hot.&quot; One lady said, &quot;I love watching a man take dick up his ass. May I feel the balls of the real man, the top in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about but Tad said, &quot;Go right ahead. Feel my manly balls deep inside him.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Brad felt her fingers get to close he shouted, &quot;Don&#39;t touch me.&quot; But the crowd kept touching.<br />
<br />
As Brad became more of a statue, he started feeling more relaxed. When only his head remained flesh, Brad was saying, &quot;Okay, touch me. It feels really good.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then someone bumped the device and interrupted the statufication process.</p>
