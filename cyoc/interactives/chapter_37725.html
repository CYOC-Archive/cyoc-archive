<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dianne:<br />
<br />
I was surprised that Dennis fit me so well. It was like he was tailor made for me. Now that I think about it he was. The program made him into my swimsuit so of course he fit me. I wanted to keep Dennis as my swimsuit. He was weird and he got his wish. With him as my swimsuit he was never born. He even gets to be close to me which is something he wanted. I started to wonder if he was getting any pleasure from me wearing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dianne! Let's go!&quot; Tiff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sowwy Tiff&quot; I said. &quot;I just like Dennis as my swimsuit so much. He wealy fits me well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like it&quot; Tiff said. &quot;He didn't ask for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he kinda did&quot; I said. &quot;He wished that he hadn't been born and now he hasn't. I needed a new swimsuit since he wuined my old one. I think this is a fitting punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you know what he did with your swimsuit&quot; Tiff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; I said. &quot;Just think what he's thinking knowing that I was a boy before. It must be making him sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we need to hurry up and get ready&quot; Tiff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am weady&quot; I said. &quot;I just need to get my sandals on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry up or we won't get to go to the beach&quot; Tiff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok ok&quot; I said. &quot;You sound like Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
We both giggled at this. I put on my sandals and we went downstairs. Once downstairs we found Mommy in the living room. She was already in her swimsuit. She informed us that we would be stopping by the store to get us drinks.<br />
<br />
Mommy buckled us into the van and we were on our way to the beach. Once we got there Amy, Maxine, and Kathy ran right to the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy! Maxine! Kathy! Stay out of the water until I tell you you can go in!&quot; Mommy said.<br />
<br />
I looked around and saw that there were a lot of people at the beach. The lifeguards must have their hands full.<br />
<br />
We walked down to a spot on the beach and Mommy laid out a beach blanket. She told us we could go play in the water but to stay where we could touch and where she could see us. She kept Fred up by her.<br />
<br />
After a couple hours of swimming I started to not feel well. &quot;I don't feel good&quot; I said. &quot;I'm gonna go lay down by Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I went up to Mommy and laid down next to her. &quot;What's wrong honey?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel good&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lay down for a bit&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Perhaps you'll feel better after you lay down. I'll put up the beach umbrella to keep the sun off you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; I said as Mommy put up the beach umbrella. I laid down and fell asleep quickly.<br />
<br />
I don't know how long it was before Mommy was shaking me awake. I saw the worried look on Mommy's face and wondered what she was worried about. &quot;What is it Mommy?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go up to the restroom and showers&quot; Mommy said. &quot;You've had an accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was embarrassed by this. I hadn't had and accident since I was four. On top of that I still wasn't feeling good. &quot;I'm sowwy Mommy&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be sorry&quot; Mommy said. &quot;You're not feeling well and it was an accident. I just hope that I'll be able to get the stain out before it sets in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's gonna watch Amy, Maxine, Kathy, Tiff, and Fwed?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Denise is here too and she'll watch them&quot; Mommy said.<br />
<br />
Mommy took my hand and helped me up. When she did I felt something on my butt and I figured out what Mommy was talking about. I had pooped in my new swimsuit though it felt watery. I looked down at the beach blanket and noticed a rather large brown spot where I was laying. No wonder I had an accident while I was asleep.<br />
<br />
When we got to the showers Mommy turned one on and had me stand under it. She started to rub the back of my swimsuit and then took it off of me. She then proceeded to scrub my back and butt with her hand. Once she got me clean she ran my swimsuit under the water and scrubbed it as best she could.<br />
<br />
Finally Mommy seemed to be satisfied that my swimsuit was as clean as it could be for now. She helped me put my swimsuit on. As we were about to leave I felt my tummy rumble and I ran into a stall. I just barely made it to the toilet before my lunch came up. I have always hated that. After I was done Mommy helped me wash the horrible taste out of my mouth.<br />
<br />
Mommy looked at me and said &quot;I better take you to the doctor. You look a little pale.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't reply to that but followed Mommy out of the restroom. We headed back down to the spot Mommy had picked out and she told Denise what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you watch them while I take Dianne to the doctor?&quot; Mommy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can&quot; Denise said. She took out her car keys and said &quot;Take my car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Denise&quot; Mommy said. &quot;I'll give you my van keys in case it gets too late. Let me go down and tell the kids where I'm going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mommy went down to talk with Amy, Maxine, Tiff, and Kathy. After Mommy talked to them she took my hand and we headed for Denise's car stopping by Mommy's van for my booster seat.<br />
<br />
As Mommy was driving to the doctor's office I wondered how sick I was.</p>
