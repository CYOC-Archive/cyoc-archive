<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;m not sure which statue that one author was referring to so I&#39;m going to make a guess.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dirk and Charlie were skilled athletes, not clumsy. The real reason they were &quot;volunteered&quot; was because Kyle didn&#39;t like them. Kyle ruled over the team like a crime boss. If you did what Kyle said, he&#39;d do you a favor but if you got on his bad side, he&#39;d tell the entire team to harass  you. Dirk and Charlie volunteered because Kyle promised the harassment would stop if they did.<br />
<br />
However, as Dirk and Charlie witnessed all the fun had at Chad&#39;s expense, they became more worried. Chad was a naked statue shown off at every party and Dirk and Charlie had promised to take Chad&#39;s place. The were especially worried when they saw Kyle, Devlin and Sam shove their dick up Chad&#39;s ass. And that&#39;s not all that went up Chad&#39;s ass. The guys were constantly shoving different items in one of Chad&#39;s holes. Other things they did was strike matches on Chad&#39;s butt, smear various substances on Chad, or people would wake up with Chad in their bed.<br />
<br />
Then for the homecoming parade, they polished Chad up all nice and shiny and put him in the center of the float. People already knew it was Chad so the announcer said, &quot;And ladies and gentlemen, the float for the football team. Chad is really gleaming their. I bet his skin never shined brighter. If he wasn&#39;t a statue, he&#39;d be considered immodest. His genitals are large for a statue. That&#39;s quite a pose he&#39;s holding too, very dynamic. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll win best float but he sure makes a unique entry. Give it up for Chad the football player posing as Mercury, the god of travelers and messengers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost immediately after homecoming, Brad was there to start the process of making Chad human. So while the team carried him out on the field, his head was human but his body was still a Mercury statue. Chad kept his mouth shut but Dirk could see Kyle had his fingers in Chad&#39;s butt while carrying him.<br />
<br />
Once Chad became fully human, he suited up but didn&#39;t say anything. Charlie had been having erotic dreams about being a statue. Even though he was nervous, he was also a little excited. But Dirk had not been having erotic dreams and when he got the chance, he talked to Chad alone about the experience.<br />
<br />
Chad said, &quot;Just let them have their fun. There&#39;s nothing you can do to stop them. I&#39;m going to try to just forget what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk asked, &quot;Would you volunteer again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad said, &quot;I would, not because I enjoyed having things shoved inside me, but because being a statue was a pleasant experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Dirk and Charlie showed up to be turned into statues by Brad. Brad had been trying to figure out how to accomplish the statue. Brad found that there were more statues at the Stadio dei Marmi, statues that would be easier to do but Kyle wanted a picture where one wrestler was throwing another wrestler. This caused two main difficulties. First, how to get the wrestler in the air touching a statufication pad since no part of the wrestler was touching the ground. Second, how to make someone hold an action pose of a wrestler that is almost completely flying through the air.<br />
<br />
Brad decided to try something a little experimental. He got the team to help him hold Dirk and Charlie in place long enough to statufy the centers of each athlete, thus creating a framework to hold the two guys in place. On their outsides, they were still soft flesh but they couldn&#39;t move. They could still talk or move their fingers but their arms, legs and head were stuck.<br />
<br />
Brad turned his head for one minute and the rugby team had already stripped Dirk and Charlie and left with their clothes.<br />
<br />
Brad asked, &quot;I don&#39;t have any clothes. Are you okay proceeding without clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie said, &quot;Statues are naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk grumbled a bit but said, &quot;Fine, let them have their fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad said, &quot;I&#39;m going to have to make small adjustments to you as we proceed which means I&#39;m going to have to touch you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie said, &quot;Do what you need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dirk said, &quot;Yea, they&#39;re going to play with our dicks and asses anyway. You might as well while we&#39;re still soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad started making adjustments until he got between Charlie&#39;s legs. The sight of Charlie&#39;s balls hanging there caused Brad to pause. He wasn&#39;t gay but Charlie&#39;s balls looked so beautiful dangling there. Brad didn&#39;t even realize he was touching Charlie&#39;s balls but not making any adjustments. He was just touching Charlie&#39;s balls. He snapped out of it and got back to work.<br />
<br />
Then he saw Dirk&#39;s ass and remembered his wonder about what Randy, Kyle, Devlin and Sam had experienced when they fucked Chad.<br />
<br />
The event hadn&#39;t started yet so Brad put up a privacy screen, dropped his pants and entered Dirk. Dirk just shook his head as best as he could since he couldn&#39;t move much. He knew this was coming but wasn&#39;t expecting it this soon or from Brad. While Brad fucked Dirk, he sucked Charlie.<br />
<br />
After he was done, he felt ashamed taking advantage of Dirk like that. He kept his mouth shut hoping that Dirk hadn&#39;t noticed. Dirk also kept his mouth shut trying to forget it happened. Brad just took a rag and wiped his cum out of Dirk&#39;s hole. Brad cleaned himself up and took the privacy screen down just in time for the event to begin.<br />
<br />
It was a much bigger event than the previous one. Brad guessed that the crowd was ten times as large. There was also reporters with cameramen there.<br />
<br />
The scientist were discussing the value of statufication. One of them said, &quot;It is an amazing achievement but I&#39;m not sure what we can do with it.<br />
<br />
The reporters asked Dirk and Charlie to describe their experience. Chad arrived and they also interviewed him about what it had been like being a statue. Neither Chad, Dirk nor Charlie were talkative, Chad and Dirk because they didn&#39;t want to reveal their true feelings and Charlie because he wanted to be a statue and statues don&#39;t talk. But Chad and Dirk did say enough to satisfy the reporters. Chad said, &quot;I didn&#39;t feel any pain the entire time I was a statue.&quot; Dirk described what his statufied feet felt like.<br />
<br />
Like Chad before him, Dirk&#39;s statufication started at his feet and moved slowly up. Brad had programmed Charlie&#39;s statufication to be more random. He didn&#39;t know what parts would become solid when.<br />
<br />
The crowd in general was more brazen, touching Dirk&#39;s genitals without even asking, treating him like he was already a statue even though it would still be eleven hours before Dirk and Charlie were completely solid.<br />
<br />
Someone accidentally spilled a drink on Dirk&#39;s foot and it had to be cleaned up.</p>
