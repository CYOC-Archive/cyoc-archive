<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec constantly for the rest of the afternoon and night considered how he was going to get himself to school and handle that while he was...like this. There was no way he was going to be able to pass himself off now as &quot;Alec&quot;. He was well and truly black looking, even though Alec knew in his heart of hearts who and what he truly was. He had to somehow work on finding out what was done to him and how to undo it. Even if it meant losing all this awesome muscular size and strength, he just couldn&#39;t stay like this forever, it was just not sustainable...<br />
<br />
First and foremost he had to set up his exit from the school. Going ahead with a plan, Alec sent them an email from home announcing he would be moving out of state due to parental business. Very good thing his parents had either business or vacation most of the time, so thus it would be thoroughly believable. He figured that the school would also be amenable to letting him back in once Alec discerned how he could go about turning himself back into his usual self.<br />
<br />
Next was the fact he was going to need to make sure he had some money and an alternative place set up just in case he hadn&#39;t resolved this by the time his parents came back in three weeks. There were more than a few high end hotels and apartments around the area, close by to the school in fact, and his trust fund had more than enough money in it to handle time spent there. So that was a good place to take care of that business...<br />
<br />
...And now there was the issue of his name. He couldn&#39;t go back into the school just calling himself Alec. Obviously not - he needed...a new name. A convincing name, along with an identity and a school profile. At least while he was working on trying to get himself reverted back to normal. He went on his laptop again and promptly started to go about searching for a fitting name for himself, browsing African American boy&#39;s names. He flicked through each name, wondering what to call himself. Then he found something that sounded pretty neat - Deion Dalton. It was appealing in its own way, it sounded masculine, and it wouldn&#39;t be an obvious alias.<br />
<br />
It was now a matter of telling the school about their new student, and putting together a convincing record. It took an hour or so, but Alec put together a convincing profile of this Deion Dalton. Supposedly homeschooled due to lack of good schools around, he was then able to go to this high school. Alec put together some education info about &quot;Deion Dalton&quot; which would let Alec take basically the same level classes as before, and hopefully move forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deion Dalton...as far as school&#39;s concerned, I&#39;m Deion Dalton from here on.&quot; Alec considered how he was going to present himself as Deion. He didn&#39;t intend to let much change - he was going to try out for sports, he was going to try and enjoy himself as much as he could, and he was going to do his best work in class. It was just the matter of his friends that made him question his course.<br />
<br />
Obviously he couldn&#39;t affiliate with them as he was now. They were... yeah. They wouldn&#39;t give him the opportunity to explain he wasn&#39;t REALLY African American. They&#39;d just see him as--- Alec sighed and realized now that their prejudice was gonna be directed at him now instead of anyone else. This was gonna be a role reversal he wasn&#39;t comfortable dealing with.<br />
<br />
At least, Alec thought as he flexed an arm and looked at his body, he was gonna be going in there as a buff dude and sports star. That should at least give him some measure of status at school.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night Alec spent trying to keep his hands off of his junk, out of fear of changing any more, not knowing if this was gonna be the furthest he was gonna go. It actually kind of ached, denying himself of the pleasure. He needed so much more touch and pleasure now than he ever had before. He actually kind of wondered how high the libido on his new black body was. And whether that could actually be useful when getting laid. It&#39;d certainly let him really give any of his girlfriends a ride they&#39;d never forget.<br />
<br />
He as usual took care of his teeth and face before bed, and drank down a protein shake. He realized as he stood there in the kitchen he&#39;d come down and fixed up all this stuff in just a pair of boxers. &quot;Huh, well, maybe I&#39;m just getting a little more bold about my body...&quot; Alec contemplated, seeing as that usually he wore at least his sweatpants around the house. As he went upstairs however he outright discarded even his boxers and walked into his room naked.<br />
<br />
Plopping down on his bed, Alec found himself thinking about how his first day at school...like this...was going to go. It both excited and frightened him, really.<br />
<br />
Alec found himself dreaming a tumultuous cornucopia of pleasant, nightmarish and odd dreams. Some had him fucking around, others were dreadful premonitions, and others showed him possible futures for himself as an African American guy. But by the time he woke the next morning, he remembered precious few if any of his dreams. As per the usual.<br />
<br />
Disentangling himself from his sheets, Alec groaned and got up, feeling hungry already. He stretched a little bit as he got some clothes together, picking out a blue tank top that showed off a lot of his chest, back and of course his arms, long shorts that&#39;d compliment the blue top, and a new jacket as well just in case it was chilly out at all. Alec consulted the mirror in his room and tried to stop himself from grimacing at the reflection he saw there. He had to keep himself working and going even while he was looking like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew, Alec, looking hot...&quot; He said with a few awkward chuckles and then realized something, &quot;Oh uh, Damn Deion, looking great!&quot; He tried calling himself that in his head a few times, but even though it felt so very wrong to be calling himself that name when he was Alec, he got used to it enough he could probably respond to being called by that name consistently. He just needed to put together a past for himself to tell the other students.<br />
<br />
As Alec fixed up a plate of food for himself, he noted his appetite was much larger than usual, which he guessed was common sense given how huge he was now. He had put about twice as much food on a much larger plate than usual, and his stomach still growled all the way until he fed himself another protein shake. Making sure he had everything with him, plus an old backpack and school supplies, he started to head out to school.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed straightaway was that even though he was different, it seemed the girls at the school were eager to look at him, but not so eager to talk to him. Eh, he figured, give em time. Alec walked proudly forward, and his strut if anything improved when he heard a couple of the girls giggling and talking rather flatteringly about him; &quot;Is that a new student here?&quot; &quot;Uh, yeah, I&#39;d remember a hunk on that level.&quot; &quot;You wanna talk to him?&quot; &quot;Ohh no! No! You talk to him first! I don&#39;t wanna be shot down!&quot;<br />
<br />
As they stopped at a light stop on the way to school, Alec smirked a little and waved at them. He watched the two girls blush with a degree of satisfaction. He never remembered any of the girls acting like this when he was how he was before...<br />
<br />
As the light stop let them pass, Alec walked forward confidently, and by the time he got to school he was actually feeling pretty good about himself. He made a stop by the office to show them his &quot;paperwork&quot; and sign in as Deion Dalton, and Alec figured this would be the start of a significantly odd part of his life. And admittedly, possibly one full of sex. Because even though he was, well, like this, Alec noted that even the principal&#39;s secretary was trying to act like she wasn&#39;t checking him out when she blatantly was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deion, let me welcome you to our school. Here&#39;s your schedule and a map.&quot; The secretary handed both over to him while substantially blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; He said with a smile, trying to not make it so obvious he was in the know about her response to him, &quot;I love this school, and I think I&#39;ll be happy around here while I&#39;m around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though as Alec left the office and headed off to his first class, he got his first hint of the less than welcoming side of the school. A couple of his old friends, immediately quieting down and glaring at him as he passed them by. Alec didn&#39;t let it bother him, they didn&#39;t know who he was and he now looked like--- again he wondered if this was trying to tell him something. They treated him so differently when he was black as opposed to white... It was like seeing from the opposite end of an experience.<br />
<br />
Then just as Alec turned around a corner heading up to his first class, he heard boots on the pavement. He turned around just in time to see his old friend Dave Marshall come marching up right to him, and Alec moved backward into a slightly closed off, out of sight area in time for Dave to stop.<br />
<br />
Dave was a big, muscular guy, pale and with straw blond hair and light green eyes, probably about 210 lbs. He&#39;d always been bigger and more muscular than Alec before, well, until now, when Alec was by far much bigger than Dave. It was actually kind of eye-opening finally looking down at least a little at the huge 11th grade student. He seemed to stare right through Alec and said, &quot;I-I don&#39;t know who you are or where you came from looking and acting like this, but you&#39;re not top dog around here, see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, never said I was. I just moved in here and---&quot; Alec tried to cool down the situation, but it seemed something was on Dave&#39;s mind. Something had to be off about this. Dave had never acted like this before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bull-fucking-shit. Huge black guy comes to our school, the girls can&#39;t stop talking about him...&quot; Dave looked Alec over, and that was when he said something that made this whole ordeal even weirder, &quot;I still look better than you. My body&#39;s better. No way are you upstaging me with the girls AND with football. I&#39;ll show you!&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was when Dave outright took off his tank top, showing off the build that for the longest time Alec had been green with envy over. A tight, slightly roid-gut-like six pack, huge boulder-like pectorals with tiny nipples, shoulders muscular in all the relevant points, jacked, strong arms bicep and tricep both, and a wide back. Even in those pants Alec could see that Dave was muscled everywhere...and there was a certain part of him that looked especially engorged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...what are you...?&quot; Alec had never seen this weird side of Dave, was he...? Alec&#39;s questions about Dave&#39;s intentions were cut off as the racist jock gripped Alec&#39;s shirt suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shirt off.&quot; It was a demand, but also somehow a desperate request. Alec didn&#39;t know where this was going, and he almost didn&#39;t want to know. But he also didn&#39;t want to find out what&#39;d happen if he refused and tried to fight or run off. Dave was the son of a high power prosecutor in the big city, and chances were Dave would try and wrangle together some kind of consequences.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say man.&quot; Alec responded and took off his jacket and shirt, showing that as big and strong as Dave was, Alec was bigger, stronger and more toned in each measure. Alec could actually see Dave almost get distracted when the shirt came off, losing himself briefly in the sight. Gulping when he saw Dave outright lick his lips, Alec realized this was getting to be seriously weird and unsettling. &quot;Uhh...yeah dude, no homo?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave breathed and looked him up and down, biting his lip and then he growled, &quot;Maximum the homo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec was shocked as the slightly shorter athlete then pushed forward and started trying to kiss him outright. Alec wasn&#39;t gay, far from it, and he was not sure what was going on here or what Dave wanted. But he was definitely shocked. He&#39;d definitely never known Dave to be this kind of guy. Hell, Dave had a girlfriend he was always having very noisy sex with at parties. Did this mean Dave had a bisexual side he never really showed...?</p>
