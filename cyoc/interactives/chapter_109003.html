<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad decided he shouldn&#39;t do anything while upset, getting up from the computer and storming out of the house for a run around the block. Jeff heard Brad leave, looking back into the bedroom his brother shared with what should have been his girlfriend. Brad left the computer unlocked, and the program running. Jeff didn&#39;t waste any time, going through and starting to change all the profile information back to normal.<br />
<br />
He paused when he reached Brad&#39;s profile, though. Even after everything that happened, he didn&#39;t blame the big guy for any of it. It was all Richie&#39;s fault. And he decided it wasn&#39;t fair to turn him back into a dumb dog just to make everything go back the way it was. He did make a mental note to talk to Brad about the weredog trait. Rich ended up hurting the both of them with what he did.<br />
<br />
After getting everything setup, Jeff leaned back in the chair and started reviewing everything. It would put Jeff back into their parent&#39;s house, and Brad would be living with Beth at their parents. He couldn&#39;t get their old house back, but he wasn&#39;t planning to. As soon as he got to his brother&#39;s profile, he grinned. His little brother had always been a pain, but now he&#39;s going to replace Beth&#39;s dog entirely. Though, he supposed it would be Brad&#39;s dog this time. And he was sure Brad would be mounting his brother every time he changed.<br />
<br />
For some reason, that thought made his cock twitch. It confused him, since he was sure he was back to normal. He had spent enough time getting mounted by the great dane stud, having his rear filled again and again with that huge doggy dick. And just remembering all of that made his own dick start to swell with arousal.<br />
<br />
Jeff still didn&#39;t think he was gay, and didn&#39;t want to change his orientation. He made certain to set his change to leave that the same, and he quickly started the changes in a slight panic to avoid having to think about it. The Chronivac whirred to life, taking longer than usual to make so many changes over such a broad area at once. Jeff felt dizzy momentarily, wondering if he did something wrong. But it cleared up quickly, leaving him seeing a message on the screen that his brother and Beth were out of range, and would be changed as soon as they got close.<br />
<br />
Brad was just reaching the door again after calming down when Jeff started the changed. He stumbled for a moment as he reached the door to his house, momentarily dizzy before it passed and his memories altered slightly. He knew Rich had caused changes, and he was furious at him for changing Jeff without permission. But now he believed he found and fixed Jeff completely, forgetting they had been turned into lovers, though he still hoped he could convince Jeff to join him in bed...<br />
<br />
Upon reaching Richie&#39;s room, Brad leaned against the doorway, crossing his arms to show off his muscles a bit. &quot;You done, or need some help coming up with something good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked over, feeling himself blush slightly but quickly shaking his head. Why did he like that sight so much? He could figure it out later, after finishing all the details... &quot;No, I&#39;m good... I decided, since Richie turned me into a dog without permission, then maybe he should know what it&#39;s like. And for screwing with you, and Beth... I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to change him back anytime soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A dog? But you can&#39;t keep a dog...&quot; Brad was confused. It wasn&#39;t a terrible idea, but something about it seemed odd to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not, but you have everything you need for a dog, right? Besides, I know you get pretty, heh, &#39;worked up&#39; around the full moon. I figured he&#39;d be able to help with that.&quot; Jeff pulled up Richie&#39;s profile, showing the pending changes. Full canine transformation, orientation to gay, and the canine mind having full control. &quot;And don&#39;t worry, he&#39;ll enjoy it. Even if he&#39;s not in control, he&#39;ll like every minute of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, patting Jeff&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Awfully nice to make him enjoy it. I thought we were going to punish him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded in response. &quot;Well, he&#39;s going to remember everything. What he did to me, how close he got to Beth... He just won&#39;t be able to do a thing but obey you and love every moment. There&#39;s just one thing I wanted your opinion on...&quot; Jeff switched over to Brad&#39;s profile, scrolling to the weredog information. &quot;Did you want to change anything for this? I&#39;m sure you&#39;re used to it, but being a dog all day for three days each month must have some headaches...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad thought about it for a moment before gesturing for Jeff to move. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve got an idea. It&#39;ll take me a few minutes, so if you want to go get a drink or something while we wait for my new dog to come home.&quot; Jeff just chuckled at that, leaving what was now his bedroom again to get a snack and drink. Brad worked quickly, setting up stats for an entirely different kind of weredog. He didn&#39;t mind the changes each month. In fact, he loved the transformation itself. But losing his thumbs...<br />
<br />
It only took him a minute to make the changes, turning into an anthro dog for the three days each month instead of a feral one. There were more changes he was considering, but first he wanted to check something on Jeff&#39;s profile. He knew it was rude, but he wanted to know at least if he had a shot. A first glance disappointed him, however, as Jeff&#39;s orientation was listed as &quot;straight.&quot; But he found something under the notes, a slider of interest that made Brad grin. &quot;Well, well... Looks like you&#39;re curious, at least. Let&#39;s see if I can do something with that... Nothing to force you, just to make you think about it more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad switched back to his profile, not wanting to change Jeff without permission. He looked over all the options he could, finding one labelled &quot;pheromones.&quot; A quick look told him everything he needed to know, scrolling down to his weredog form and adding a special trait to his pheromones in that form to increase the libido of any gay guy who smelled them. All he&#39;d need to do is hang out with Jeff tomorrow when he changed, and he&#39;d have his shot!</p>
