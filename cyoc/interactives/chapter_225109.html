<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As simon turned to find some glasses, he distantly heard a door slam and the sound of excited whispers cross the room. While he thought the burst of near universal excitement odd, he shrugged it off. Somewhat glad to have found this group, he didn&#39;t want to disappoint the gang and just focused on his mission. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, he quickly spotted a man bearing a nametag - evidently one of the workers on staff - lazily leaning on  to what looked like a serve-yourself-bar. As with everyone, the man was costumed - wearing what looked to be a loose fitting black and white skunk costume, albeit one with fur patterned to look like a classic butler&#39;s outfit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You on Staff?&quot; Simon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yea!&quot; the young man said, his attention shooting up seeming a bit flustered to have someone approach him as he adjusted the hood of his skunky outfit. &quot;How can I- er- help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking for-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;wait! Hold that thought.&quot; The man shot a finger up as he rustled thought the pockets of his onsie &quot;I just remembered the doors are closed! the guy who hired me for the night said after that I have to introduce myself in character. lets see...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked down at a notecard of his own. Evidently Simon wasn&#39;t the only one who&#39;d come unprepared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I have one of those too!&quot; Simon replied, a small smile crossing his face. He was a bit uncertain at this party, especially having failed to design a costume of his own, but was increasingly glad others were sharing that discomfort. <br />
<br />
As the man found his card he returned the smile. &quot;Hell yea! Glad to see I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s unprepared for this thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First time here too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well- yea - but I&#39;m here to work. Honestly didn&#39;t have much choice. &#39;bout a week ago I was driving and accidentally hit the curb. Ended up running over some of the flowers outside this place. That weirdo Mister E was pissed, said he wanted to call the cops - frankly I&#39;d had a couple - but then, he offered to forget the whole thing if I promised to work this here party tonight&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well that worked out I guess&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yea - frankly I&#39;m the last person you&#39;d expect to play butler. Not really the strict rules following type - but happy to toe the line for a night if it means skipping out on a DUI&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet&quot; Simon said with a slight smile, a bit unsure how to respond. <br />
<br />
&quot;anyyyyyway. Boss says I have to read this here card, aparently tonight i&#39;m supposed to be <i> Charles, the politie, affable butler skunk. Expert sommolier and barkeep, I know all there is to know about the drink after years of service to the manner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;heh. well, nice to meet you charles&quot; Simon stuck out his hand<br />
<br />
&quot;Charmed&quot; he replied, giving it a firm shake paired with a slight bow of his head. &quot;happy to be of service&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles paused slightly, his brow furrowing at his own words. <br />
<br />
Simon likewise blinked, noticing charles&#39; words slowly take on a strange air of distinction, and a slight british accent  a far cry from the laidback slacker tones he&#39;d used before.<br />
<br />
<i> Guess hes committing to it</i> Simon thought. &quot;Nice to meet you Charles, I&#39;m -er-  Stafylos, the  eternally tipsy satyr. You can call me staf thought....Guess we&#39;re both staf in our own ways!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;certainly&quot; Charrles replied, the dry british accent remained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway charles, can I trouble you for some glasses, my herd needs some wine to start the night&quot; Staf said. He licked his lips slightly, increasingly excited to taste his wine. As he stood, he couldn&#39;t help but notice his head was beginning to spin slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Always happy to assist.&quot; Wasting not a moment, Charles bent over and grabbed four glasses. Standing back up, Staf couldn&#39;t help but notice his posture was oddly straighter. Gone was the carefree slouch from before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Four glasses for the young goats. the crystal I&#39;ve selected will pair perfectly with the grecian origin of your wine&quot; He handed the four glasses to Staf &quot;Do enjoy yourself sir&quot;<br />
<br />
Staf fumbled with the glasses slightly, his balance a bit off. Once he collected himself, he paused, realizing something was off &quot;How&#39;d you know what crystal to pair...Greek wine? and that there are four of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I , well, as the butler to the estate its my....&quot;<br />
<br />
The man paused,  furring his now dark black eyebrows  as if only then realizing what he&#39;d said &quot;as the butler...&quot; <br />
<br />
The words trailed off as his look of confusion only deepened. Raising up his hands, he seemed to marvel at them. Both covered in dark black fur, and tipped with sharp claws. Turning them over, both men could see they sported thick paw pads - perfect for gripping the bottles of the bar. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t wearing gloves before...this fur...its....mine? &quot; He again trailed off as a hand lightly stroked through the fur, feeling his changed hands.<br />
<br />
As Staf&#39;s mind grow tipsier, he couldn&#39;t quite fully comprehend why Charles was so confused, and only managed a light, somewhat bleating laugh at the odd sight<br />
<br />
&quot;You ok Charles&quot; He said, slurring his words slightly.<br />
<br />
 Stolen from his reverie, Charles&#39; head shot up  and body returned is full posture &quot;Er -um. Yes! Of course! so sorry good sir, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m just a tidbit confused is all. Not feeling quite myself. But...don&#39;t you worry sir, this is not a matter for guest. I&#39;ll sort this out myself by nights end&quot; Charles smiled a toothy smile. Staf could help but notice the once loose hood of the costume seemed flush against the man&#39;s head. It black fur almost indistinguishable from the skin below. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Good luck with that! For me it&#39;s time to party!&quot; Stag replied, slurred delight in his voice as he raised the glasses in excitement. turning he slowly stumbled back to his friends. <br />
<br />
As staf walked away Charles couldn&#39;t help but notice the boy&#39;s hair was fading from blond, to the same purple of his legs. Without much putting much thought to it, Charles grabbed a glass and began to give it an expert shine <i> don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to me, but it just feels so good to be of service. </I> lifting up the glass, he admired its glint in the light. The shine was perfect. He couldn&#39;t help but smile in pride. In its reflection, he couldn&#39;t help but notice a large black and white mass lift up from behind him. <br />
<br />
Turning, he was unsurprised to see the large, furry skunk tail rising from the small of his back. &quot;Heavens, I&#39;ve grown a tail!&quot; He remarked to himself. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?! Why am I a skunk and why...why does working this bar just feel so...right?&quot;<br />
<br />
He rubbed his head slightly, only to find his ears had navigated to the top of his skull. &quot;I should really get out of here&quot; He thought, looking around the room for an exit. Just as soon as the thought entered his head, however, a competing, even stronger thought told him a man of class doesn&#39;t leave his post unattended. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...I-I really should leave&quot; he winced as the competing thoughts played in his head, the later thought only getting stronger as he scanned his post. For some reason the tidy, well kept bar just ...excited him. Not a glass was out of place, nor a speck of dust anywhere to be seen. the perfection of service it represented just....enticed him. Excited him.   &quot; I-I just can&#39;t.  It would be....uncouth.&quot; His face relaxed a bit as he found himself accepting this thought. &quot;The master would be positively remiss if I left my duties. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more than enough time to mull my strangely  mustelid form later.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he grabbed another glass and, with a contented grin, began to give it a polish.</p>
