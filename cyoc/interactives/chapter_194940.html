<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chase blushed s he came out of the changing rooms. Literal changing rooms in this case, where he donned his loaned selkie skin. What had him blushing is he stepped out of the room without his swim trunks on. Sure, Ketill had stripped them off plenty of times before, but there was just something about walking out into the pool are without anything on that seemed more intimate.<br />
<br />
It was cold, too, too cold for humans. With the power out the pool&#39;s heating had given way. The ceiling that once showed the dark sky and it&#39;s twinkling stars was covered over by frost, and ice had even started forming at the edges of the pool. There was something strangely romantic yet eerie at the same time. Like the pool had been abandoned to time.<br />
<br />
Except for the table which had been set up by the side of the pool, a couple of lit candles sitting atop it. Ketill was standing there, looking quite proud of himself. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Chase asked, as if he didn&#39;t know, he could feel himself blush as the selkie eyed him up and down hungrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;A date, <i>sæti</i>.&quot; Ketill said, &quot;A real one. I thought you might like something other than just a swim. Though I seem overdressed.&quot; He laughed and pulled out a chair, for Chase to sit down on. He pulled off his lifeguard outfit and tossed it aside, proudly showing off for Chase, arms akimbo before taking his own seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you make this?&quot; Chase asked, a bit stunned as he looked over the sushi and sashimi spread laid out in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Vættir</i>, no. I raided the resort&#39;s sushi bar.&quot; Ketill laughed. &quot;I can grill a fish but I can&#39;t do fancy like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t have to do this you know, I&#39;m happy with our swims.&quot; Chase said, glad the fur hid his blush and the table his arousal thinking about those &#39;swims&#39;. About all it had in common with swimming was being in the water. Chase had never been with someone with quite as voracious a libido as this selkie had. He picks up the chopsticks and was about to dip a piece when Ketill blocked the soy with his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try without first. You haven&#39;t eaten as one of us, have you?&quot; Chase shook his head, then popped the piece of raw fish in his mouth. He had had plenty of sushi before, even since he got into anime in high school. But this, there was tastes to the fish he had never noticed before. His eyes must have gone wide because Ketill laughed happily. &quot;Different tongues, different taste. Just wanted you to see before dipping it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ketill dipped a piece himself to prove the point, but Chase was popping another piece in his mouth without, inable to contain a grin at the new experience. &quot;You know, I was afraid the towel wouldn&#39;t work.&quot; Chase refused to call it a skin, there was something unsettling about that, even it if was true. &quot;Changes seem to be going crazy all over the resort.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes. That is because it is mine.&quot; Ketill said, reaching out to rub the short brown fur on Chase&#39;s arm. &quot;My spare. It is linked to my magic, not the Arctic&#39;s. A new skin wouldn&#39;t work, this one, well, I have enough magic to keep two skins working.&quot; Ketill rubbed his chin. &quot;When the magic is working again, we could get you your own. The markings would be different, but it would be yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase stopped eating and stared at Ketill. He was enjoying their fling, sure, it was keeping him distracted. But now their project was pretty much done until real cables could be laid in the summer and he had a whole week before he had to leave the resort. He had thought of spending time with Ketill, but this sounded like something more. He wasn&#39;t like Tom or Eric, he couldn&#39;t just pack up and go some place new. Hell, even Vic seemed ready to join his new dog pack.<br />
<br />
Ketill seemed to sense his hesitancy and pulled his hand back. &quot;Or not. But I will remember these couple weeks fondly if you do leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase set down his chopsticks and looked down at himself, rubbing a webbed hand over his furred chest. He did like this, but, he needed time. &quot;How about this.&quot; Chase started and Ketill looked up with a piece of fish dangling from his muzzle he quickly slurped. &quot;I have to come back up in the summer when it&#39;s warm to help with the cable project, I already promised Tom I would help. Why don&#39;t we try this.. slow. A little long distance, we can even plan time for you to maybe visit me. You guys have a good connection now so we can video chat. If that works, then maybe come the summer..&quot; Chase shrugged.<br />
<br />
Ketill tilted his head. &quot;Visit you? In California, yes? I have always wanted to try surfing, and maybe swimming with my sealion cousins.&quot; He smiled and clapped his hands. &quot;Agreed, as long as I can call you my <i>kærasti</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means?&quot; Chase had enough trouble following the foreign words Lars used. Ketill&#39;s were something else altogether. Maybe a language app on his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyfriend.&quot; Chase stood up and stepped around the table, holding out a hand to Chase. Taking it, he was pulled to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, guess that would be true. Long distance dating, but yes.&quot; A moment later, Chase found himself being very thoroughly kissed. He barely noticed as they fell sideways into the ice cold water.<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Eric sat in the living room, the only light coming from the fireplace in front of him warming his front while Clyde was a softer heat against his back. He had Bix&#39;s flute, his flute up to his lips. His <i>isä</i> had taken some time to help him learn to play. It was different from human flutes, mainly due to the fact reindeer had less fingers to work with, but it produced an airy, almost haunting sound when played. When played well.<br />
<br />
Eric still produced the occasionally shrill whistle, or flat note. He had only had a few lessons after all, and this was one of the simplest songs, but Clyde had said it was a favorite of his, so he had asked Bix to teach it to him first. The elder reindeer was a surprisingly patient teacher, Eric had expected him to be his usual blunt self, but something seemed to have been dulling Bix&#39;s edges lately. He still wasn&#39;t sure how he felt about his mother and <i>isä</i> seemingly being together. A little jealous maybe, but of his mother or Bix?<br />
<br />
He finished the song and put down the flute. Clyde pressed his nose into the back of Eric&#39;s neck, taking a sip whiff of his scent. &quot;You&#39;re getting better. It was almost recognizable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric burst into a grin and laughed, nuzzling back against Clyde. &quot;I should dump you for being mean. You&#39;re lucky I love your stupid face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid? Have you been getting flirting lessons from Lars again?&quot; Clyde asked with a laugh of his own, then in a more serious tone. &quot;Never leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Eric asked, concerned and turning around a bit so he could see Clyde&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never leave me. I feel like I already almost lost you once, and..&quot; Clyde wrapped his arms tighter around Eric, pulling him close. &quot;It would have killed me, <i>höpönassu</i>.&quot; Clyde sniffed. &quot;So promise me. Promise me you won&#39;t leave me, until we&#39;re both old, gray muzzles with great-great-grandkids, and even then we go together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric leaned his head against Clyde&#39;s shoulder, his unbroken antler resting against on of Clyde&#39;s. &quot;I promise.&quot;</p>
