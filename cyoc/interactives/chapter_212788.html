<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Eric confirms the change to the Jaguar&#39;s file, the beast lets out a surprised growl, it then lies a paw on its head, as if it just got a headache, &#39;I bet it does not feel pleasant when something alien enters a mind,&#39; Eric thinks to himself. The Jaguar-Boy waits a few minutes before speaking up, “um... I d-don&#39;t know if y-you understand me,” he says, “b-but... are you a-alright?”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar lowers his paw and stares at the Jaguar-Boy with wide eyes, “wh-what happened to me? I f-feel weird... wait! Am I TALKING? I... I can understand you now,” the Jaguar, who seems to be a male, according to its deep and gruff voice, says.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s eyes widen, “it... it actually worked?!”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar gets to his four paws, taking on a aggressive stance , letting out a growl, “you did this to me,” he asks with a growl, “you better explain before I loose myself! Who... no, better: WHAT are you? I have never seen a Jaguar like you before! You better not lie to me... or else!”<br />
<br />
Eric takes a few steps back, holding up his hands, “w-whoa...,” he says, “c-calm down, please. I promise I&#39;ll explain everything.”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar, relaxes and sits back down, but keeps a close eye on Eric, “then begin.”<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “okay, first let me answer your question,” he says, he takes a deep breath then continues, “I am... was... a human, I... I got transformed into a Jaguar-Human-Hybrid.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” the Jaguar asks, “how? And how did you make me... like... this?”<br />
<br />
“Me and my friends,” Eric says, “arrived in this jungle yesterday. My friend, Greg, he told us about a App which supposedly has unlimited strong magical powers. It is called “The Chronivac”, Greg then had the crazy idea, if we transform into anthropomorphic versions of some of the animals which live in this jungle. We all thought it&#39;d be fun, so... here I am,” Eric pauses to let the information sink in.<br />
<br />
“That sounds to crazy,” the Jaguar says, “but... I just HAVE to believe it... I mean... look at me! I was a “dumb” animal who was curious about the weird looking Jaguar, then I watch you do something with that thing in your... paw? Hand? And suddenly I feel freaking smart AND I can understand and talk the human language!”<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “I know it is crazy,” he says, “I didn&#39;t believe it myself, until the transformation of my body started.”<br />
<br />
“Why did you do this to me?”<br />
<br />
“I... y-you mewed, which sounded like a question,” Eric explains, “s-so I thought, to make it easier for both of us, giving you my language and human intelligence would help.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” the Jaguar says, “makes sense, when I think about it,” he adds thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
Eric smile, “my name is “Eric” by the way,” he says, “d-do you have a name?”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar tilts his head, “no? We... normal animals... don&#39;t have names,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Oh... right,” Eric says, rubbing the back of his neck, “um... m-may I give you a name.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm... that depends,” the Jaguar says, “what sort of name do you have in mind.”<br />
<br />
“Um... well... I...,” Eric says, “at f-first I thought about “Spot”.”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar snorts, “Spot? You serious,” he lets out a laugh, “nah... no thanks.”<br />
<br />
“Ye-yeah... dumb idea,” Eric says, “h-how about... um... a name... which suits your... um personality?”<br />
<br />
“My personality,” the Jaguar asks.<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “the personality is the special combination of qualities or characteristics, they form an individual&#39;s distinctive character. Your personal character makes you different from others,” he explains.<br />
<br />
“Hmm... I understand,” the Jaguar says, he then looks at the boy, “so, tell me: what is my character?”<br />
<br />
“W-well,” Eric says, “for one, you are very beautiful and majestic, second: you come across as a very strong and powerful creature... but what stands out the most, in my opinion, is that you give off a very strong dominant vibe.”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar tilts his head, “those do sound like things I could relate to,” he looks at the Jaguar-Boy, as he looks at Eric, the Jaguar notices something which he did not notice before: Eric&#39;s body language tells the Jaguar that the Jaguar-Boy seems to be nervous, the tip of his tail flicks from said to said in an uneasy way. Eric&#39;s face, though seeming relaxed, has a nervous expression, seeing these signs causes the Jaguar to grin. “Tell me, Eric,” he says, getting to his paws and slowly walking towards the Jaguar-Boy, “do I make you... nervous?”<br />
<br />
Eric gulps when the Jaguar once again comes closer to him, “y-yeah,” he says, “I... kinda feel... weird in y-your presence.”<br />
<br />
&#39;Hmm... I feel this cub seems to be pretty submissive,&#39; the Jaguar thinks to himself, &#39;hehe... I think I&#39;ll have a little fun with him.&#39; The Jaguar starts to circle the boy, as if circling a prey, “tell me, Eric,” he says, rubbing his body against the Jaguar-Boy, “what is the weird feeling you feel?”<br />
<br />
Eric swallows hard, his mouth and throat feel suddenly dry, “I...,” he croaks, he swallows again, “I f-feel as if... as if I have... um... s-submit myself to y-you.”<br />
<br />
&#39;Hehe... I knew it,&#39; the Jaguar says, he then backs off a little, &#39;I may not be gay, BUT in the animal kingdom, we dominant males enjoy subduing weaker males. I hadn&#39;t any luck finding a female... but this cub... he will do nicely as a replacement!&#39;<br />
<br />
Eric looks at the Jaguar, not sure how to read the animal&#39;s expression, “so... yeah...,” he says, “I... I dunno why I feel this way. I mean... I am into females... I am not gay!”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar chuckles, “neither am I,” he says, “don&#39;t worry, Eric. Tell me, this Chronivac-thing you used on me... what else is it able to do?”<br />
<br />
“I... I honestly don&#39;t know,” Eric says, “I have just downloaded it and hadn&#39;t had the time to fully study it. According to Greg though, it is able to do all sorts of things, like making someone younger or older, transforming someone into an object, change someone&#39;s race or species... and even change someone&#39;s gender... .”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar&#39;s eyes light up at the last option, “really,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “according to my friend,” he says.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hmm... if that thing can change someone&#39;s gender...,&#39; the Jaguar thinks to himself, &#39;Eric might become more useful to me... hehe... .” The Jaguar then says, “sounds interesting,” he says, “I&#39;d like to try a few things out. But first, back to this “name” business: what name did you think of, that suits my... personality?”<br />
<br />
“I... thought of the name “Amory”,” Eric says, “the name stands for: “Leader”, “Divine”, “Brave” and “Powerful”.”<br />
<br />
The Jaguar thinks about it for a while, “Amory... Amory...,” he says, he then grins at Eric, “I do like the sound of the name, thanks Eric,” he says, “I think it suits me well,” he adds.<br />
<br />
Eric smiles, “my pleasure, Amory,” he says, “I should start to head back to my friends,” he then says, “I bet they are already worried where I am.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like to meet them,” Amory says, &#39;I could have some fun with them too,&#39; he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm... I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be a good idea,” Eric says, “they&#39;ll panic and think you&#39;ll attack. One of my friends packed hunting rifles. I don&#39;t want you to get hurt... or worse.”<br />
<br />
Amory tilts his head, “hmm... okay,” he says, sounding a little disappointed.<br />
<br />
“L-let me tell them about you first,” Eric says, “b-but I&#39;d like to keep our relationship a secret... for now. I mean... that is if we are... um... friends?”<br />
<br />
Amory grins, “of course we are, Eric,” he says, &#39;and soon we&#39;ll be more than “just” friends... hehe,&#39; he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Can we meet again,” Eric asks, “m-maybe later this evening?”<br />
<br />
Amory smiles, “I&#39;d like that, Eric,” he says.<br />
<br />
Eric smiles, “nice, um... w-where should we meet,” he asks, “I am not sure if I&#39;ll be able to find this location again.”<br />
<br />
“How about I&#39;ll follow you to your camp,” Amory suggests, “I&#39;ll stay out of sight. Once I know where your camp is, I&#39;ll come back in the evening and make myself known to you in some way. I&#39;ll figure something out!”<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “sounds good,” he says.<br />
<br />
Amory walks up to Eric and rubs his head against his body, actually purring, “thanks, Eric for making me unique. I really enjoy being able to talk and have this high intelligence.”<br />
<br />
Eric smiles, “it is my pleasure, Amory,” he says, “c-can I give you a hug?”<br />
<br />
Amory tilts his head, “what&#39;s that?”<br />
<br />
“A hug is a friendly way to great each other or say good bye,” Eric explains, “I wrap my arms around your neck or body and gently squeeze you.”<br />
<br />
Amory smiles, “sure,” he says, he then sits down on his hind legs, Eric crouches down a little, he then wraps his arms around the beast, his new friend, and gives him a squeeze. Eric feels Amory carefully placing a huge paw on his back, this causes Eric to smile and close his eyes.<br />
<br />
Eric takes a deep breath, inhaling Amory&#39;s scent, “y-you smell... strong,” he says.<br />
<br />
Amory chuckles, “and you smell good yourself,” he says, Amory then grins and gives Eric a lick on one of his ears, causing the Jaguar-Boy to let out a surprised squeak.<br />
<br />
“He-Hey,” he says, “wh-what was that for?”<br />
<br />
“Hehe,” Amory says, “just a little kiss, that&#39;s what friends do... right?”<br />
<br />
“Um... y-yeah,” Eric says, “b-but warn me next time,” he adds, pouting cutely, Amory chuckles.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing,” he says, “sorry.”<br />
<br />
Eric chuckles, “all good,” he says, the two smile at each other.<br />
<br />
Suddenly they hear the sound of flapping wings, “ERIC,” they hear a voice call, “BRO, STOP PLAYING! WHERE ARE YOU?!”<br />
<br />
Eric panics, “quick, hide,” he says.<br />
<br />
Amory nods, “see you later, Eric,” and with that the huge cat dives into the thick shrub.<br />
<br />
Eric waits a few minutes until he is sure that Amory is out of sight, he can still feel the big cat nearby, &#39;man... his aura is strong,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I hope Dean hasn&#39;t spot him with his parrot eyes,&#39; he then calls “DEAN, I&#39;M HERE!”</p>
