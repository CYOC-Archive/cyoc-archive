<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen walked along with his new legs and came to a field, night had fallen and he needed to rest. There was enough light coming from a nearby light pole that he could see what he was doing. Jen sat down with a colossal thud and looked his new self over. His upper half was still that of his previous female self, long blond hair, D cup breasts and a slim waist. Below that his waist spread out to his now massive hips, which measured in at ten feet in circumference. He noticed that he was several feet away from his crotch, and decided to test the range of movement, finding that he was able to reach nearly to the gap between his thighs with enough effort. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s at least one good thing.&quot; Jen said. <br />
<br />
Around his massive waist was a large skirt, trimmed with gold around the waist. He looked up and saw the now giant legs he possessed, they had digitigrade paws at the end, and were cover in pitch black fur. That would explain why he felt like he was walking on his tip toes the entire time. His eyes scanned up his legs, past his hips and up to his waist, the fur continued the entire way until it reached his waist and became faint and flush against his waist. Looking back he saw a tail to match these powerful legs, also covered in black fur. <br />
<br />
He decided to try something, leaning against the light pole, he was able to move his right leg in such a way that he could examine his paw, his new legs surprisingly more dexterous than his original. This move also made his balls shift, making him painfully aware that this was all reality and that this was all his. He reached, bending slightly and touched the velvety surface of his pads, It tickled a little and confirmed what his balls had done just a few seconds ago. Jen stretched his leg back down, it was starting to cramp, and let out a sigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why this? Why these legs.&quot; Jen groaned.<br />
<br />
He was looking down and noticed that to the right of what was obviously the strap to his skirt was a pouch. Jen opened it, reached inside and pulled out a rather nice looking wallet. Inside he found several thousand dollars, and a new I.D. Joe Smith, the name said, and the gender was male, but it was her face, her smile in the picture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Joe...&quot; Jen said. &quot;Okay I&#39;m Joe, Joe Smith. I think I can handle that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe looked down at the clasp that held his skirt shut, thinking that he&#39;d better not look at his new manhood, but the temptation was irresistible. Joe put away his wallet, and undid the clasp letting his skirt fall free and he looked down. There in front of him was his manhood, it was about half a foot long and a foot wide, but it was still flaccid, not even close to stimulated. He reached down, bending toward his cock, and decided to reach past it. He gingerly touch one of his balls, they were huge, he gently grabbed it with both of his feminine hands and brought it closer, He felt his cock stir a little, his balls where the size of large beach balls, after feeling his balls for a bit, Joe decided it was time to see what his cock looked like. He gently touched it, rubbing to stimulate it and it slowly grew, the harder it grew the harder Joe rubbed, until it reached full size. Joe leaned against the light pole and slide his ass down a little to look at it standing straight up. It was three feet long and a foot and a half thick, reaching just to his breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a freak!&quot; Joe cried looking at his manhood. He punched it and let out a yelp like a dog would. Joe in anger grabbed his cock and started to roughly rub it. He brought it close and started to bite it yelling in anger, but the heat of his cock started to get the better of him and soon his lips and tongue taste the skin of his cock, Before he new it he came, moaning loudly for no one to hear, It felt like eternity, the bliss was sensational to him. Joe sighed, sat up slightly, glanced one last time at the freak he had become, and nodded off, He would deal with where to go in the morning.</p>
