<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Wake up, my little moo-cow! It’s a brand new day!” Alex’s eyes shot open as he was startled awake. Ugh, he felt terrible, bloated and uncomfortable. Where was he? He reached a hand up to rub at his eyes, but froze after he bopped the nose at the end of his muzzle with a hard, heavy hoof. Oh, that’s right, he remembered with dread as he looked down at his thick furry body and trembling, milk-filled udder. I’m a cow now…<br />
<br />
“Up and at ‘em, my boy. Or rather, girl.” The strange man from the previous day had returned, seemingly eager to continue tormenting Alex. The cow lugged herself to her hooves, her cow bell ringing faintly. She gathered courage and looked the man in the eye, her long tongue lapping nervously at her thick, leathery nose, as she worried what trials and tribulations the man had in store for her today.<br />
<br />
“You’re full,” The man said, indicating Alex’s massive mammary with a nod. Alex gaped stupidly down at his udder. It was even larger than before! It was definitely a few inches bigger, as the four long, thick teats now swayed mere inches above the ground. And worse, it was much heavier, tugging his rear insistently downwards. It took significant effort just to remain standing. The udder’s pink flesh bulged obscenely, clearly almost filled to capacity. Alex estimated mournfully that he must be holding several gallons, at least.<br />
<br />
“Well, c’mon, Daisy. Only one thing to do for you now.” The man opened the gate, and stepped into the stall. Alex scrabbled fearfully backwards with as much grace as a ready to burst prize-winning dairy cow could muster. “Moooooooo!” He bellowed, as his uncomfortably tight udder squeezed painfully between his hind legs, one long, puffy teat releasing a quick spurt of milky liquid.<br />
<br />
“Now, now, there’s no use doing that,” the ginger man said, quickly closing the distance between himself and the cow, before looping a thick rope through the collar around Alex’s neck. “This way,” he said, leading Alex with the rope like a leash. His spirit broken, Alex didn’t bother to resist, the cow bell around his neck clanking to signify his movement. He waddled slowly, placing each hoof unsteadily with a faint clomp, his hind legs pushed slightly apart by the ridiculous udder between his legs.<br />
<br />
“Here we are!” The man stated, as they approached the metallic machine in the corner of the barn, as Alex had known they would. “It’s time for you to experience what it truly means to be a milk cow, Daisy.” The boy-turned-cow wanted to protest, lash out, do something, but at the same time, he knew he really needed to be milked, as horrifying as that may be. His udder was painfully tight, and he didn’t know how much longer he could stand it.<br />
<br />
Tying the rope quickly around a nearby post, the man circled the cow’s thick, furry flank, sizing up her engorged milk sack. “Now, that’s quite the udder you’ve got there. You’d win best in show at any fair I’ve ever been to, with assets like that. And I’m sure the bulls will love it,” he added menacingly. His hand suddenly shot down, between her legs, grasping at one thick, quivering teat. Alex shivered at the strange sensation of his teat being groped. Why did his hands have to be so cold? The man yanked sharply once, twice, a third time, and Alex grunted at the sudden relief as a spurt of milk shot from his udder.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure that felt great. But I think you’ll really enjoy this if we speed the process up a bit,” Luke said, rising and grabbing the milking machine. It was quite simple, really, just four suction cups that fitted around each teat, with tubing that drew the milk into a bucket in the center of the machine. Luke quickly attached the suction cups to Alex’s udder, each fitted snugly around a teat. “Get ready,” the man smiled deviously, as he flicked a switch on the side of the machine.<br />
<br />
The sensations were overpowering. He’d felt relief when the man had tugged on a teat, but now, with each suction cup sucking happily away, he was euphoric. “Ughh.. Moooooo…” He grunted softly, wanting to deny the intense pleasure his milking was giving him, but finding himself unable to. The damned cow bell clanked humiliatingly as he bobbed up and down unconsciously in rhythm with the milking, tail twitching, occasionally raising and lowering a hoof with a loud clomp. <br />
<br />
Untold minutes later, Alex finally felt the machine shudder to a halt. The man detached the suction cups from the cow’s teats, pulling each away with a wet ‘plop’. Alex noted bitterly that his udder, although certainly less full and much squishier, still retained almost all of its incredible size. Alex remained standing where he was, panting with his thick tongue lolling stupidly out of his mouth. His entire body was flushed, warm and tingling as the pleasurable feelings lingered. Although the milking had felt amazing (something which Alex hadn’t fully come to terms with yet), there had been no release, and Alex was terrified to find that his body still craved something more.<br />
<br />
“Wow! Four buckets!” The man exclaimed, grunting as he pulled a milk-filled bucket from the bowels of the machine. “I’ve never seen one cow give so much milk!” He smirked, as the cow glared at him angrily. “Now, now, Daisy, don’t look at me like that. You’ll have another milking later this week to look forward to.” Alex snorted in frustration. He didn’t want to have another milking, not ever! “Fine,” the man snapped, his eyes narrowing maliciously. “Normally a cow with an udder of your… impressive size would need to be milked about twice a week, to replenish your reverses, of course. But since you enjoyed your milking so much, I’ll make you the exception.” He snapped his fingers. “There! You’d best get used to this routine, Daisy. You’ll be waking up each and every morning with a tight, milk-filled udder that’s ready to burst.”<br />
<br />
No! Nooo! “Mooooooo!” Alex bellowed, unable to take any more of this nightmare. He snorted angrily, unable to stop himself as he lifted a rear hoof and unleashed a powerful kick at Luke, his rump and (especially) udder rippling heavily with the backlash. Luke grunted in surprise, stumbling backwards as he fell on his ass. Alex felt a momentary burst of triumph, before the man was on his feet before him in a flash. “That was a mistake,” he said, all humor gone from his face.<br />
<br />
Luke led the cow, her udder perpetually jiggling and her cow bell constantly clanking, back towards her stall. “I wanted to wait for a time before this next part, to let you become accustomed to your new situation.” He sounded almost sad. “But you’ve forced my hand. I’ve had a new thought about the next phase in this game, but you might not like where this is going. I’ll be back shortly.” With a crack, he was gone, again disappeared into nothingness. Alex trembled, shuffling his feet as he shifted his gargantuan udder into a new position. He didn’t know what would happen next, but whatever it was, it didn’t sound good…</p>
