<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After breakfast, Jeff hobbled around the house doing random chores as per his Mother&#39;s instructions. She said that he needed as much practice walking in heels, and this was the best way for him to both learn while also still being helpful. <br />
<br />
However, to Jeff, this was an exponentially and a literally harder challenge than what his Mother believed it to be. His erection was in full swing, and was also the reason for his awkward stumbling too. That and the fact that his Mother never left his side for the entire morning. <br />
<br />
On a few occasions, he even though he heard her click her tongue in some kind of disappointment towards him. He wasn&#39;t sure if she noticed his erection, or was just frustrated with how slow of progress he was making, but each time she did it, he felt a mix of frustration with the situation and, oddly enough, motivation to improve his balance even faster. <br />
<br />
After a slow, difficult morning of seemingly endless random chores, Jeff was feeling a little more confident in walking in his heels. His feet did ache a little however. But when he asked his Mom about it, she just looked at him confused and asked what he meant when he said &quot;his feet hurt&quot;.<br />
<br />
It took him a little bit to realize that she genuinely didn&#39;t know why his feet hurt. Then it hit him. Of course she wouldn&#39;t know. To all human females, wearing heels all day is completely natural, and their feet won&#39;t hurt from doing so either. But with him being male, he didn&#39;t recieve the benefits. So of course his feet hurt. <br />
<br />
This wouldn&#39;t do. If he had to wear heels all day, every day, then his feet would likely be very worn out and in so much pain after only just a few days. He had to fix this. <br />
<br />
Jeff, now momentarily free from his Mother, slowly walked up the stairs to his room and sat down at his desk. He opened the Chronivac and then loaded in his own profile. He selected his feet, and then applied the same benefiting changes to them that he had given to roughly half the human race. <br />
<br />
Immediately, his feet felt so much better and walking with his newly shortened tendons was much easier too. It was like a night and day difference. He decoded that, rather than looking too proficient in walking in heels, like he now was, that he should still look to be struggling for his parents. So he practiced faking stumbling and being bad at walking in heels for roughly an hour or so, until his Mother called for him.<br />
<br />
When he &quot;tripped&quot; on the last step, she just shook her head and caught him. &quot;How long will you take to get skilled enough to not fall ever other step? We could hear you practicing, and you just kept on stumbling over and over and over. This is something every girl has learned and mastered how to do, and you can&#39;t even walk straight without tripping over yourself? Pathetic. This isn&#39;t something that is this hard to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to look as sorry as he could, but clearly that didn&#39;t have much of an impact on his Mom. If anything, she took it to be his declaration of resistance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You&#39;re sorry? Then if you&#39;re sorry, it means you did something wrong right? I guess you aren&#39;t taking this seriously yet. We did tell you not to push you luck, so you have only yourself to blame for this. Come with me, and stop fake tripping. I wasn&#39;t born yesterday.&quot; Scolded his Mom. <br />
<br />
Jeff, not expecting to have been caught in the act right away, now felt like an idiot for even trying such a thing. He followed his Mother outside and sighed when she told him to get into the car. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t ready to be seen in public wearing heels, but at the same time, he had never been more erect. But his poor attempt to hide his erection brought about even more of his Mother&#39;s frustration. She drove right to a small shop and told him to wait near the store front in the seatting area. Then she came back after a few minutes and tossed him a small box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to the bathroom and put that on right now&quot; she demanded. Jeff looked at the box and realized it was a chastity cage. He looked back at her with an &quot;are you serious&quot; expression, to which she snapped and pointed towards the store&#39;s bathrooms. <br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t want to do it, but feared what would happen if he didn&#39;t more, so he reluctantly got up and walked into the men&#39;s room. It took him a few minutes to get the thing on properly, but when he did, it was very uncomfortable. It fit him perfectly, but it prevented himself from becoming erect. <br />
<br />
When he walked out of the bathroom, he was met with the disapproving glare of his Mother, who was now carrying yet another purchased item. Inside the box was a black choker that had the name &quot;Jessica&quot; engraved on the bright pink tag hanging off the front.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you are so smart huh? Put this on young lady. How dare you enter the men&#39;s room in front of me. I can clearly see that we have been far to soft on you. So I will ramp it up a bit. From now on, Your name is now Jessica. Your Father and I will be introducing you as our daughter, and refer to you as such in conversation. We will also be filing an official form with the government, declaring your official change of name and gender too. Now get that thing on and get in the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica felt like something massive inside of him just sank into his gut. This was a lot bigger than he anticipated for just a small oversight on his part. But it still sent erotic chills throughout his body when he imagined being introduced as a girl named Jessica. Having an ID to prove it too. Being made to always use the female facilities whenever out in public. He already was unable to use urinals anymore, but this just hit the nail on the head. He now actually had to sit down in order to pee, and now had to wipe as well thanks to the cage. <br />
<br />
He got into the car and quietly sat there while his Mom drove the car. But where she was headed made him anxious. She was not heading back home, but further into town...</p>

Where is she headed?</h3>
