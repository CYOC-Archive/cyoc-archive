<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next 20 minutes or so Chloe was just taking in her new body. It was strange, with her hips being wider the way she walked was different, the distance between each leg had been changed. It wasn’t difficult, but it was odd. Then it was the weight of her huge ass and thick thighs, she felt herself being pulled towards the ground more, that her legs were filled more with fat than muscle, she had to force herself to stay upright, otherwise she’d fall right down. <br />
But that didn’t stop her, walking around her room, feeling each jiggle, each bounce. Even jumping up and down, feeling her body shake and wobble in ways completely foreign to her. She tried twerking, which was so much easier now with a fat ass, but also turned her on way more than she anticipated it would.<br />
“I wish I actually had pants that fit me.” She said. She looked down at the pair of destroyed jeans that she’d wished off. They changed, morphed, stretched to accommodate her huge ass. But they didn’t fix, “I wish my jeans were fixed.” She said. And as wished, the patches of broken denim stitched themselves back together in a matter of moments. Before long, they perfectly fixed.<br />
She walked over, intending on picking up her jeans and somehow putting them on her huge body. But then she chuckled, “there’s no point in even doing that.” She said to herself. She walked over, and stood in the two leg-holes that were exposed on her jeans, “I wish my jeans were on me.” The jeans immediately lifted up, wrapping themselves around her wide hips and thick thighs. The zipper flew up and the button closed itself. She didn’t even have to do anything anymore!<br />
She looked at herself in the mirror, the jeans accenting her butt in a brand new way… but they could be better, “I wish my jeans make my ass look great!”<br />
The material of the jeans shifted, it became softer, it stretched once again, as if it were tailored perfectly to her body. It even padded her ass somewhat, making it more comfortable and even more attractive looking.<br />
<br />
After a few extra wishes, most of which involving giving herself more comfortable and fitted underwear, Chloe felt hungry. She still hadn’t had dinner yet. She thought about just wishing herself whatever she wanted, but she knew that wouldn’t be as fun, and what is the harm in giving this new trunk for a spin?<br />
She opened the door to the living room, and immediately the sound rushed in. The loud TV playing a reality show, the music obnoxious and the annoying accents almost immediately making Chloe feel nauseous, as they always did. She walked in, her ass wobbling as she did. She looked over to see the back of Natalie’s head, her curly brown hair. She didn’t comment on Chloe walking in.<br />
<br />
Chloe entered, closing her door quietly behind her, before she made her way into the kitchen area of the apartment. It was overlooking the living room, with a clear view of the TV. Chloe walked over to the fridge, she managed to bump into the countertop with her widened hips. It could’ve been annoying, but strangely, Chloe was really into how strange everything felt.<br />
She opened the fridge… empty. Aside from various sauce, a slightly out of date tub of butter, and some milk. It was a little depressing to look at. But Chloe didn’t have to worry.<br />
“I wish our fridge is full!” She said excitedly to herself. And lo and behold, food started to appear. Bacon, eggs, meat, vegetables, even orange juice appeared! There was enough food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for at least a week or so. And even then, enough room for snacks. She’d never seen a fridge more stacked than her own ass!<br />
“I wish our cupboards were filled too.” She said. She quickly closed the fridge and opened the cupboards. Everything they could’ve needed! Canned food, bagged food, even spices she’d never even heard of in her life, “holy shit,” she said to herself, “I don’t even knew how to cooked half this stuff—” she said, then her eyes widened and she chuckled, “I wish I did! I wish that whatever I cook, it’s always amazing!”<br />
And suddenly, her mind filled with culinary knowledge, she knew how and what to cook, and even had memorised how long to cook it for. She could envision it perfectly in her mind, as if she’d dedicated her entire life to the art.<br />
But after all that… all she wanted was a pizza, “I wish I had a pizza.” She said. And like so, a plate appeared on the countertop behind her, followed by a base of bread, then tomato sauce, then cheese, then pepperoni, then even sprinkled some basil, before it heated itself up and became a perfectly cooked, steaming hot pizza. And then, it split itself into 8 perfect slices. Her mouth watered at the sight… then again, she giggled, “I wish that pizza is actually good for you, that all the ingredients provide all the… uhhh… necessary requirements for a diet or whatever, that it’s healthy to eat with no negative side-effects. But it still remains as tasty.”<br />
Nothing changed. Chloe shrugged, assuming it worked. She reached over and grabbed a slice, lifting it to her mouth.<br />
<br />
“When the hell did you order a pizza, Mom?” Natalie asked. Chloe hesitated. She looked down, realising that the counter was blocking Natalie’s view of her massive new ass,<br />
“I didn’t… I made it.” Chloe replied,<br />
“Bullshit.” She said, “why are you always lying.” Natalie said, looking grumpy. Chloe took a bite into the pizza.<br />
“Holy shit.” She said. It was really good! Better than most pizza’s at the fanciest of restaurants. And better yet, there was something strange about how it felt. It felt healthier, like everything entering her body was benefitting her health. It was weird.<br />
“What?” Natalie asked, “where did you get it?”<br />
“I told you, I technically made it.”<br />
“Technically?” Natalie replied. She grabbed the TV remote and paused the show. She stood herself up and walked herself over to the counter, “well if you made this magical pizza, why’re you acting like it’s so damn good?”<br />
“Cuz it is.” Chloe replied, getting a little annoyed with Natalie’s attitude.<br />
“Fine, can I have a slice?”<br />
“Sure.”<br />
Natalie reached over and grabbed a slice, she lifted it to her mouth and took a bite. And like magic, her eyes lit up. Chloe had never seen her more in heaven, “what the fuck… how is this so good? There’s no way you made it.”<br />
“Well just believe me. I did.” Chloe said.<br />
Natalie took a few more bites before she’d finished the entire slice, “I totally don’t believe you, but if you’re gonna die on this hill, whatever.”<br />
“Well I’ll bring it to the couch, and we can watch TV and eat the rest together?”<br />
“Sure, mom. But as long as you don’t complain about my shows like you always do.”<br />
“I literally never do that.” Chloe said, picking up the plate of pizza.<br />
“Yeah you fucking do, whenever I’m watching anything, you always criticise me.”<br />
“Hm…” Chloe said, making her way around the corner, “has anyone ever told you you might have mommy issues?” She asked,<br />
“What the fuck does that even— OH MY FUCKING GOD!?” She yelled upon Chloe walking past,<br />
“What?” Chloe asked, a huge smirk appearing on her face.<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO YOU!? YOUR BODY? Your ass…” Natalie shouts, staring in disbelief,<br />
“You like it?” Chloe asked, she turned around, showing off her whole booty to her roommate.<br />
“What the fuck did you do, mom…”<br />
Chloe took it all in, looking right at Natalie’s reaction, at her face. It was priceless. “Aaaaand, I wish you think my giant ass is normal, and you act like none of this even happened.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-haaaat… is going on…” Natalie said, looking calmer but also still panicked, “why the fuck is my heart beating so fast?” She asked herself, lifting her fingers to her neck, checking her pulse,<br />
“Is it cuz of my giant ass?” Chloe asked, again turning and wiggling it at her,<br />
“Embarrassing, mom. No, it’s not because of your huge ass. You think I’d be shocked by it?” She said, looking disinterested, “I need some water…” she said,<br />
“Don’t worry, I wish I had a glass of water in my right hand.” Chloe said. A glass materialised into her hand, and quickly filled up with water, “here.” She said with a smile, handing over the glass to Natalie,<br />
“Huh?” She looked back, “oh uhm… thanks?” She said, looking puzzled.<br />
Chloe waddled her way over to the couch to sit down and watch shitty Reality shows, with no intention of paying attention. She just planned on playing her new ‘toy’ for the rest of the evening.</p>
