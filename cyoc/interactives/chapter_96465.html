<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The feeling started as a warming sensation that burst deep within his chest and billowed out through his veins like a hot gust of wind, searing the underside of his skin like water flashing into steam as it is thrown into a hot pan. The sensation made him light headed as the room began to spin and his limbs went numb.  Maybe I ran a bit further than I should have today thought Francisco.<br />
“Excuse me guys,” he said, trying hard to keep his voice steady as his heart pulsed with the liquid flames. “I just need to grab a drink and I’ll be right back.”<br />
<br />
With considerable effort, Mr. Mendes fought against the haze of pleasure as he staggered his way down the hall to the kitchen. Every step seemed to reverberate throughout his body as though his sinews were the strings of a guitar being plucked with every movement. As Mr. Mendes put a hand on the wall to steady his progress, he was followed by the gaze of Ric and Josh as they observed the changes which were slowly but surely occurring to their counselor. Though slight, they could see that the shirt was already fitting tighter than it was before. His shoulders were wider, his chest was broader and his neck was thickening almost imperceptibly if it weren’t for the veins that stood throbbing out on top. His forearms and calves looked more toned, pulsing and swelling with every step he took. As he slowly and deliberately made his way down the hall, the boys began to wonder whether Francisco realized what was happening or not.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, the only thing Mr. Mendes had on his mind was whether he was undergoing a seizure or not. Now he was beginning to tremble imperceptibly and almost uncontrollably as he neared the sink. With stiff concentration, Francisco reached up to take a glass from the cupboard when he was struck by another wave of searing pleasure. His skin felt as though it were tightening to the point where it were a drum being beaten against by the relentless pulsations of his heart, being filled from underneath with massive amounts of heat and energy. Now his senses seemed to be heightened to a point where every touch rippled and reverberated against his skin; a gust of wind against his neck, now glistening with sweat; the brush of his denim shorts between his legs; the soft rubbing or his cotton shirt against his heaving chest and even the prickling tickle of his hair as it stood on end was as clear and perceptible as though he were standing naked in falling snow. From deep within him he couldn’t help but let out a moan as the shudder of pleasure surged through him almost making him go numb with its intensity. Mendes couldn’t explain it, but with every breath that he took, with every beat of his heart, with every quiver he made, it felt as though he was getting heavier, as if his body was expanding from the inside out, pushing harder and harder against the bones that supported it and the skin that confined it. <br />
<br />
As Ric and Josh observed form the kitchen door, they could see the thin, athletic frame of Mr. Mendes begin to fill out. Every breath he took seemed to function as an air pump that was slowly beginning to blow him up. Already his shirt and shorts were looking as though they were at their limit to contain him. His broad, rippling shoulders showed clearly through the stretched fabric of his back, but still they broadened, widening and rounding out to fill most of the width the shirt could provide. The neck was yoked with cords of muscle, stretching and swelling to fill the collar. Watching their counselor grip the edge of the counter, they could see his arms starting to beef out as the widening biceps filled what little space the sleeves could provide, and even down to the fingers, which appeared stronger and thicker than they remembered. The shorts had little room themselves and looked noticeably smaller as his quads and ass began to inflate and look more toned, pushing the veins further and further to the surface as they became cloaked in more and more muscle. The two boys exchanged glances and were about to say something when another burst of pleasure billowed within Francisco causing him to moan once again.<br />
<br />
Looking back, the boys watched as Mr. Mendes braced himself against the counter gasping for air when Francisco heard a pop from his chest. The sound was so small but resonated so strongly that it was as though he had burst forth at the surface of a lake gasping for air. In fact, he realized that he was in fact gasping for air, and as he looked down he became aware of a new feeling that he didn’t realize had taken hold of him; pain. Around his feet, around his waist, about his neck, and under his arms, it seemed as though his clothing had become a massive boa-constrictor that was slowly trying to suffocate him to death. Finally, he became aware of what had been happening. Before him, swelling further and further with every moan and groan and gasp for air, his chest had strained the bounds of his shirt so much that the first button had burst off letting the shirt pull away to reveal his mounding pecs, covered with a thick carpet of dark glossy hair and crowned with two hard undulating nipples, heaving up and down with every breath he was now able to take.<br />
<br />
Now Mendes began to panic. What is happening to me? Why am I growing? His heartbeat quickened. His breathing became erratic. Sweat now began to drip from his face, running down his neck and over his chest, tickling his skin like a silver thread being drawn across him. His frenzy seemed to redouble the pace of the expansions for now he began to hear a faint ripping sound from the seat of his shorts. He twisted around flailing his arms that rippled and jostled like the bulk of a lion to see what was happening, ripping out the back of his shirt as he went so that the swelling sweaty knobs of muscle that covered his back could be exposed to the cold rush of air. Now able to see, Mendes discovered that his round, muscular ass was now beginning to rip out the seat of his shorts, followed closely by his thighs that were straining the seams on either side creating slight popping noises like the branch of a tree as it is starting to break. Oh my god! He shouted in his head, and he began clawing at his belt to alleviate the strain they were putting on his enlarging hips. As he groped at his waist to undo the clasp, his hands happened to brush against his abs which were now standing out like the ridges of a mountain across his abdomen. Even that slight touch sent tremors across his skin making him almost double over with pleasure, feeling as though he were a bell reverberating from the deep, jarring strike of a hammer. Never before had he known such strength and such pleasure, and never did he think that it could be his.</p>
