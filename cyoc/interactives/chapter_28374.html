<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jarred gave a wink to Jennifer, he certainly did not believe in magic and weird things that go bump in the night. He knew her well, read her like a book, she being a dreamer, filled with fantasy thoughts, hopes, and of pipe dreams that could never become anything but pure fiction.<br />
<br />
He smiled at Jennifer and she at him, both ogling the other as if each wore a kooky look and a face to match.<br />
<br />
Inside the stable a mature stallion stud pony felt the sudden welling up of an aura of great power. It was enough power to change more than physical bodies, it could interact upon time and future events.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Misses Morrison sat playing card on her one afternoon at the bridge club get-together. She sat jabbering about everything under the sun; but with what Jarred said, she suddenly felt a horrid feeling.<br />
<br />
Excusing herself from the table, Misses Morrison went quickly to the bathroom and eyed her funny looking face in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my word, oh what is this, oh, oh I shall be so very embarrassed!&quot; Misses Morrison muttered in dismay, she seeing how her face looked, as skin turned much darker, not a summer tan, but becoming as the blackened hide of one of her ponies.<br />
<br />
The strange sensations seemed to floor her entire being, the worst came when her slacks ripped down the seams. The change had begun, her thighs looked like those belonging better on a pony mare. Buckskin hair on a black and thick hide, her rump asserting and growing much larger; she screamed from the raw sensations she felt well from within her lower regions.<br />
<br />
Horror changed to a plain fear of what was occurring. She watched her rump and legs grow and change, becoming strong hind limbs like a pony mare.<br />
<br />
The surge of change only spread, moving up over her very womanly torso. She shook her head in utter disbelief, &quot;This cannot be happening,&quot; said Misses Morrison, her ears growing longer, became quite sensitive, hearing the footsteps of someone coming toward where she stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey in there, did you fall in, go down the tube, or what; you are wanted back at your table, hey!&quot; Mable Townsend hollered, she a busybody, renown for her tall tales of what people did in their very private lives.<br />
<br />
Misses Morrison just made a grunting sound, enough of a remark for Mable to imagine a story to make up, as why someone would stay in a bathroom for more than twenty minutes.<br />
<br />
Hearing Mable laughing as she walked along down the hallway, Misses Morrison stood there just steaming mad.<br />
<br />
Anger and emotion were her real enemy, as such heightened states of mind caused the body to reach a peak level in functions; this helping the change to surge and race onward to a final conclusion.<br />
<br />
In the corral a surprised Jared stood dumbfounded, he watching as his dearly betrothed lover was herself taking on the physical form of a Palomino pony and mare.<br />
<br />
Inside the stable and stall of Big John a mature pony stallion and stud was regaining his human demeanor, both physically as well as with the full mental faculties he had when a husband, father, and farm owner.<br />
<br />
Mister Morrison was seeing his humanity come back into proper form. Everything would soon have him being the man he was, or as before he wished his first wish to have the shaft as did the pony stallion stud, who was then really, Jarred.<br />
<br />
The brash and self assured wish of Jarred roared onward, taking with it more than just those of the Morrison family, but others too, those previously effected from in the community.<br />
<br />
At the Killingsworth Ranch and associated farms one John Killingsworth , Jr. felt the power of what Jarred wished. He stood caught up in a silly wish that went totally wrong. Out in a pasture one large and mature Black Angus bull got to his four feet, stood looking around, feeling his bulk body begin to melt.<br />
<br />
Jarred and John were once the best of friends, and from a foolhardy wish made of the magical Medallion, John and his human history vanished; as his body changed, so then what was changed to conform, leaving his parents without a son, but the farm with a new and handsome e bull.<br />
<br />
The physical body and skeleton that was John Killingsworth took back its previous human characteristics. Oddly, but with sensual thrills, his skin and black pelt of bovine hair remained longer, leaving John to eye and touch, enjoying his bestial self from a new perspective.<br />
<br />
Back at the card game another lady felt the necessary urge to use the very private room and upon her entering the room she discovered torn clothing and a floor made slippery from urine and some droppings, dropped out in anguished moments.<br />
<br />
Lucky for Misses Morrison, she slipped out of that house and was in full gallop toward home when the party came to an abrupt end.<br />
<br />
Panic filled a mothers heart, she knowing her every human thought and memory. She remembered her previous time as a pony mare, of a stallion she then knew was in fact Jarred, and how he brutally mated with her.<br />
<br />
Worried for what might be happening to her dear daughter, the then Buckskin pony mare raced headlong for home.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had by then regained her lovely equine conformation, she feeling the raw pangs of her alert and sensual self.<br />
<br />
Jarred too, he becoming his American Shetland pony stallion self. Changed of form and as well in mind, his original transformation came from a willing desire to know and feel what do animals. His mind became quite lusty, moving him to begin the equine courtship of one neat and fine formed' mare.<br />
<br />
A whirlwind of power and changing went on, Big John too being then his human and manly self walked out of the stables. Although naked and unconcerned due to his lengthy time living in and as within the body of a stallion pony; he stood by the corral fence as one Jarred the stud, mounted his love named Jennifer, she back to being a sleek bodied Palomino mare.<br />
<br />
Jennifer screamed her protest of Jarred mounting her, she then a moral minded Palomino mare.<br />
<br />
Mister Morrison stood watching, remembering his many times when mounted and thrusting up and inside some lusty mare.<br />
<br />
The sound of rushing hoofbeats caused Mister Morrison to turn and see a Buckskin mare come running toward the corral. The mare screaming her harsh sounding whinnies, a warning to her daughter, as if begging of her not to give in and allow Jarred to get close.<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard her mother scream, knew the warning from both a human morality and an equine manner of communicating. She bolted forward, a moment after Jarred had entered her with his mighty shaft. He slipped off of her back, his maleness giving a horrid pop as it exited the tightly puckered lips of one wild little mare.<br />
<br />
The Medallion calmed, its heat cooled, and again things were as what Jarred wished, all knowing and as they were before.</p>
