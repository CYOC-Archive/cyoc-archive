<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie gazed curiously at the young teen in front of her. Time travel? Of all the crazy things she had seen over the years, time travel seemed a bit too far fetched. “How is that possible,” she asked. “There’s..no way that could be true.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously,” Lynne groaned. “With all the crazy things you’ve seen and done. Time travel is the thing that makes you say no way not possible.”<br />
<br />
Katie blushed slightly as she gazed at the young teen and her friends. “Okay good point,” she admitted. “But What are you dong here? Let’s just say for a moment I believe you, why would you come here?”<br />
<br />
“I needed to talk with you and Gloria,” Lynne said. “It has to do with a something you’ve been worried about, if you catch my drift. But first, can we go inside it’s kind of cold.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she and her friends escorted Lynne and her friends inside. As Lynne entered she gazed around her sisters home. “I see you haven’t started decorating,” she said casuallly. “Where I’m from you and Kellie really did the place up. It’s looks....kinda empty right now.”<br />
<br />
“You can criticize my decorating tastes later,” Katie sighed. “Right now I need to know what your talking about. I also want to know if what your saying is true.”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough,” Lynne smiled. “Tell you what, why don’t we test our magic auras. As an added bonus we could test my blood with Gloria’s. If I am who I say I am those tests will prove it.”<br />
<br />
Katie rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she looked at the young teen. “Okay fair enough,” she said. “Why don’t you come with me. Your friends can stay here with the others while we talk.”<br />
<br />
“Actually I was hoping Tommy could come with us,” Lynne said quickly. “Why don’t you leave Trica with those two.” Lynne pointed towards Samantha and Mike, causing Tricas eyes to bulge. Quickly the brunette teen grabbed her friend. “What are you doing,” she hissed.<br />
<br />
Lynne smirked as she looked at her friend. “Hey just making it easier for you to introduce yourself to your folks,” she grinned. “Your the one that wanted to talk with them so badly.”<br />
<br />
Tricia looked between Samantha and Mike before looking at Lynne. “But...what do I say?”<br />
<br />
“You’ll think of something,” Lynne smiled. She now turned towards Katie to see her older sister rubbing her chin thoughtfully. “Sammy, Mike, what do you think?”<br />
<br />
“We should be able to handle her,” Samantha answered as she now stood next to Trica. “Why don’t you take her and her friend to the other room to talk. Maybe go and get Gloria too just in case.” Katie nodded as the others led Tommy and Lynne to the other room. As Tricia turned she could see Samantha and Mike looking at her. The teen gulped as she recognized that look. It was the look her parents gave her whenever she was in trouble.<br />
<br />
“So,” Samantha said, crossing her arms. “What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“T..Tricia,” She stammered, lowering her eyes. Mike stepped forward as he studied the young teen. “Where are your from Tricia?”<br />
<br />
“Me and my friends are from here,” she said quietly. “About 15 years in the future.”<br />
<br />
Mike thoroughly studied the young teen before asking her more questions. “So do you have a last name or did they do away with those in the future.” Tricia sighed heavily as she looked at the floor. She had wanted to see her parents when they were young but why. She had overheard an argument that morning between them but it was nothing of consequence. Still something bothered Tricia, it had been her mother. Samantha had yelled at Mike about being reckless. She hit him with a barb that had stung Tricia. “You’ve always been reckless Mike,” she had said. “Your recklessness is the reason we are where we are today.” Tricia knew what that meant, her mother was angry for being preganant so young. Tears now began to well in her eyes as continued to stare at the floor.<br />
<br />
“It’s Tricia Davis,” she sniffed.<br />
<br />
Mike and Samantha gave the young teen an odd look, it was Mike he finally spoke. “Davis,” he questioned, “what are you like a relative of mine or something?” Tricia nodded sadly, as a tear fell to the floor. “How can she be my relative,” he mused. “I don’t have any siblings and none of my cousins last names are Davis?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe you knocked someone up,” Samantha joked, causing Mike to go pale. Trica looked up at her mother, her smiling face only made Tricia feel worse. “Th...that kinda of happened,” Tricia cried softly. Samantha and Mike gaped at the girl, unable to process what was being told. After a few moments Samantha turned, punching Mike as hard as she could I now the arm. “Ow,” he yelled, rubbing his arm. “Why you hit?”<br />
<br />
“Are you cheating on me,” Samantha yelled. Mike threw his hands defensively as he began to back away from his angry fiancé. “What no babe I swear!”<br />
<br />
“He didn’t cheat,” Trica groaned. “He never cheats. He...he loves you very much, my dad is the most loving person in Then world.”<br />
<br />
Samantha paused as she looked at the young teen. “Wait,” she said slowly. “Are you saying I’m your mom?!?”<br />
<br />
Tricia nodded slowly as the tears began to fall freely from her eyes. Samantha’s gaped at the young teen before quickly looking between Mike and Tricia. “But that’s impossible,” she scoffed. “I mean if you and the others came from the same time the it couldn’t be true. I’m not pregnant, Mike always uses protection.”<br />
<br />
“Um about that,” Mike said sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Samantha turned slowly, her eyes bulging as her jaw hung open. “What,” she hissed. Mike slowly backed away from an angry Samantha, he could see she was close to exploding. “Sammy I didn’t want to say anything,” he said quickly still backing up. “But..um, remember after I proposed  when we went back home? Well...here’s the thing. The condom....um...it kinda broke.”<br />
<br />
Samantha stared furiously at Mike before looking back at Tricia, her head on a swivel she now looked between the two, unable to process what she was hearing. “No,” she said flatly. “No, no no, nope, no. I can’t be preganant, I can’t it’s impossible. Nope.”<br />
<br />
“Sammy you okay hon?”<br />
<br />
Samantha turned, glowering at Mike causing him to shrink back. “You,” she grumbled. “You just...you just stay their and  be quiet. The condom breaks you just forget to mention it.”<br />
<br />
Mike stepped back, sheepishly looking towards the floor. “I’m sorry Sammy,” he whispered. “I mean, I thought we would be okay.”<br />
<br />
Samantha narrowed her eyes as she now glowered at him. “Well Mike apparently not if our future daughter came back in time to say SURPRISE,” Mike remained silent as Samantha stomped over to her purse. Pulling out two $20 bills she once again stomped over to her fiancé, shoving them into his chest.<br />
<br />
“Go out and get me a preganancy test NOW,” she yelled.<br />
<br />
“Hon the stores are closed,” Mike whined. Samantha’s stared daggers at him causing him to sigh. “Okay, Okay I’m going.”<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Tricia said quickly. Mike and Samantha stopped as they gazed at the young teen. “I..I can help show that you’re pregnant,” she whispered. “And dad wouldn’t have to go out. That is if it’s okay?”<br />
<br />
Samantha and Mike looked at each other before sighing. Nodding in agreement they now watched as Tricia reached into her pocket. Lifting her hand up Trica showed her parents the Ring of Age. “Gloria gave this to me when I started high school,” she said. “Lynne already had her own magic object and since she always loved babysitting me, she felt it was appropriate.”<br />
<br />
“So what are you going to do,” Mike asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to speed up moms preganancy,” Trica sighed. “If mom is pregnant that in a few moments we’ll know for sure.”<br />
<br />
Samantha and Mike looked at each other anxiously before sighing. “Okay do it,” they whispered. Tricia now concentrated as Samantha and Mike held each others hand, hoping this was just an elaborate joke.<br />
<br />
At first Samantha felt nothing, slowly though a wave of nausea began to overcome her. The girl swooned slightly, causing Mike to catch her. “You okay Sam?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh nauseous,” she groaned. Rubbing her stomach Samantha looked down at her waist, her jeans felt oddly tight on her. As she continued to stare she could see that her stomach looked slightly bloated. “Um Mike,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
The young couple watched in both horror and fascination as Samantha’s stomach began to grow larger. What started as a bloated stomach was rapidly growing. Samantha winced as her jeans strained against her growing stomach, when she though she could take the pain no longer the snap on her jeans burst open, causing her stomach to expand outwards. Mike and Samantha were almost hyperventilating as Samantha gazed at Hernandez now very preganant stomach.<br />
<br />
“Okay done,” Tricia whispered. “I just made you seven months older. I’m sorry mom and dad, your having a baby.”<br />
<br />
Samantha stared wide eyed at the young girl, unable to answer. “I..I..” She stammered. “Oh my god Tricia I....” Samantha gasped loudly as she grasped her hands to her stomach. “Sammy,” Mike said with concern. “Are you Okay?”<br />
<br />
Samantha looked at Mike in surprise before looking at Tricia, “She’s kicking,” she smiled. Samantha laughed softly as she grabbed her fiancés hand. Mike left his hand there for a moment before jumping in surprise. “Whoa,” he said in astonishment. “She has a hell of a kick.”<br />
<br />
The young couple laughed softly as they gazed at her stomach. Samantha now looked at the forlorn girl. “Hey,” she said softly. “Come here for a sec.” Tricia slowly approached as her parents smiled down at her. “I’m..I’m sorry mom and dad,” she whispered. “I..I ruined everything for you two.”<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Samantha said sternly. “Listen...this..this is kinda nuts, especially since I had no idea but don’t you ever say you ruined anything.”<br />
<br />
Tricia smiled sadly as she gazed at her parents. “So um Tricia,” Samantha said. “Why don’t you turn me back to normal so we can talk.”</p>
