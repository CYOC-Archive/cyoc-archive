<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Tim departed, Richard was left to sulk in the cage. He paced for a spell before he finally settled his bulky from on a three-legged stool and surveyed his surroundings, which other than the stool consisted of only a cot and a bucket.<br />
<br />
Curious, Richard stood and walked to the bucket. &quot;Hmmm, it&#39;s empty,&quot; he said aloud, wondering until his brain clicked onto the probable function for the container.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, no,&quot; he realized with another wave of deep-rooted mortification. He remembered, too, that the cage was now locked. &quot;Damn you, Tim.&quot; He hoped his friend returned soon enough that any pressing need for the bucket would never materialize.<br />
<br />
Tired of pacing and sitting, he dropped his hairy form on the small cot. He heard the springs groan as he settled onto a thin blanket and stuffed a single small pillow behind his head. He stared up and past the criss-cross of bars that formed the top of the specimen cage, which measured barely 10 feet by 10 feet. &quot;Damn animals in a zoo have more space,&quot; he thought ruefully.<br />
<br />
He stared down at his furry torso and at the front flap of the spotted leopard pelt loincloth. Once he began thinking of what the flap concealed, he couldn&#39;t get it out of is mind until he lifted the flap and peeked at the flaccid cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell, even soft its humongous,&quot; Richard whispered aloud. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s this awful body so damn itchy?&quot; Richard groaned and reached to scratch at the thick thatch of dark pubic hairs with fingernails in desperate need of a professional manicure. His scratching felt good, so he dug his fingers in deeper, plunging deep into the wiry thicket of hairs and scratching in vain at the maddening itch that seemed to pervade his crotch. <br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t intended to do anything to wake the slumbering beast that flopped against a hairy thigh as he pushed it aside to keep scratching, but even that contact in its immediate vicinity had a clear-cut effect. Blood rushed into the soft cock and began to pump the sensitive organ to life.<br />
<br />
Richard moaned and ceased the scratching long enough to move his dirty fingertips closer to the hardening shaft. &quot;It&#39;s so...hideous,&quot; he whispered, gazing at the blatant girth of the shaft as it also stretched out longer. He moved his fingers down to brush the large, heavy balls suspended in the jungle man&#39;s wrinkled, pendulous scrotum.<br />
<br />
His loathing of his new form mingled with a mostly involuntary fascination at the incredible sensitivity as the enormous penis responded to even the slightest touch. He gave the shaft an almost reflective swipe, then another, before he realized what he was doing and pulled his hand away. Before breaking contact, that brief action had stimulated the organ to the point that glistening pre-cum leaked from the gaping slit that cleaved the enormous mushroom-shaped head. When he pulled his hand back toward his face, Richard&#39;s dark eyes regarded the coating of shiny pre-cum on his fingertips. He sniffed and his brain responded with a surge of lust as he smelled the scent there on his fingers. The sensation seemed to overwhelm him and he plunged the dirty fingers into his mouth and sucked off the natural lubricating fluid from the tips as his over-stimulated cock continued to leak.<br />
<br />
When he regaining his clarity, not to mention his composure, he spit the fingers from his mouth in disgust. &quot;Why am I behaving like this?&quot; Richard wondered with trepidation.<br />
<br />
He leapt from the cot, but his now full-fledged erection pushed at the front flap of the leopard pelt loincloth. So, with Richard standing awkwardly in the center of the cage, that was how one of the expedition&#39;s team members found him when the man entered the room as an escort for a group of strangers.<br />
<br />
The looks of dismay and shock registered plainly on the assembly of onlookers outside the cage. If not for his thick beard, the blush of shame on Richard&#39;s face would have been easily noticed.<br />
<br />
A man in a gray suit with an officious manner stepped closer. &quot;This is the so-called jungle man?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young graduate student that Tim and Richard&#39;s grandfather had selected as a member of the expedition stepped forward. The young man knew more about cataloging ancient pottery than the finer points of anthropology or perhaps, in this case, primatology.  &quot;Yes, we stumbled across him while collecting some artifacts in some lands claimed by one of the jungle tribes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the official said, having already noticed some of the artifacts as they walked through the expedition&#39;s camp. &quot;Artifacts are one thing,&quot; the man said, &quot;but biological specimens are quite another. I&#39;m afraid your jungle man will have to come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The little man snapped his fingers. One guard retrieved the keys from their peg on the wall while two others stood in defensive postures with their heavy rifles at the ready.<br />
<br />
Richard&#39;s humiliation at being gawked at by the group changed to alarms when he heard the click of gun stocks as the men readied their weapons. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure this is a good idea,&quot; the graduate student tried to protest in a feeble manner. <br />
<br />
The official handed the grad student an official looking document. &quot;Present that to your expedition&#39;s leaders,&quot; the official said.<br />
<br />
The graduate student swallowed nervously and folded the document.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it have any understanding?&quot; The official asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; the graduate student said with a nod of his head. &quot;We&#39;ve taught him some basic words and phrases...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting. We heard that there had been an incident and that one of your expedition&#39;s members had been injured by it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard grumbled under his breath at being referred to as an &quot;it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t all that serious,&quot; the graduate student tried to explain, although the official was no longer listening. <br />
<br />
Ignoring the inconsequential graduate student, the official leveled a domineering gaze on the jungle man. &quot;Move,&quot; he commanded.<br />
<br />
Richard&#39;s first instinct was to tell the self-important bureaucrat to get bent. The guard had the cage open and all three of them had surrounded him. One of them shoved him toward the door. &quot;You heard the man,&quot; the guard barked.<br />
<br />
Richard surprised himself and startled the men with a low growl from deep in his throat. He stopped when he heard an ominous click from one of the guns trained on him.<br />
<br />
The jungle man&#39;s nature raged against the smaller men trying to force him to behave in a particular way. When one of the men shoved him again and pushed him into the door frame of the cage, the jungle man&#39;s assertive personality surfaced and overwhelmed Richard&#39;s attempt to stay calm.<br />
<br />
Richard wrested a rifle from one of the men and hurled the weapon across the room. He grunted and made a step toward the unarmed man.<br />
<br />
At that point, the guard behind him simply reversed the position of his rifle and clubbed Richard in the back of the skull with the blunt gun stock. Richard&#39;s felt the room spinning as his hairy form sank to his knees. He moaned and then slumped unconscious to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like your jungle man still has some anger issues,&quot; the official remarked to the stunned graduate student.<br />
<br />
With the snap of his fingers, the official concluded his visit by having the three large men drag the unconscious jungle man to a waiting truck.<br />
<br />
The graduate student continued to stare at the road after the truck hauling the official, guards, and jungle man disappeared out of sight when he heard the sound of a vehicle&#39;s engine coming from the other direction. Waving the document left by the official, the flustered graduate student ran to present Tim with the papers explaining the confiscation of the jungle man.</p>
