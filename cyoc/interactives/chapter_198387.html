<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim looks up realizing he is still behind the counter. He couldn’t believe he missed his chance when we noticed someone the looks exactly like his wife was walking by holding the hand of someone who looked exactly like him. Tim looked down at the watch and realized the minute hand now was pointing down. Something about the watch dial being different must have changed the swap. He couldn’t remember exactly what they were doing but he knew he could brainstorm more when is break comes up in 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
As he continued to ring up customers, he glanced over to Destiny and noticed it was Destiny’s body back in her life. Thankfully his girlfriend was back to normal. As he was ringing up the last girl, the manager came by to dismiss him for his break. “Adam, you can take your break now” “Adam?” He thought. “Yeah, that’s right. Weird I would forget my name.” As he walked by his girlfriend Destiny, he lightly tapped her butt and winked at her. Destiny playfully winked back.<br />
<br />
Adam walked out front of the store as Adam liked to walk during his breaks. Now he had time to play with the watch and figure out what happened. Adam noticed the hour hand had been moved between the 12 and 1. He decided better start from the beginning and moved it back to 12. Here he noticed the wall of the watch said “aware” between 9 and 3 on the top and “unaware” between 3 and 9 on the bottom in small print. He decided to leave it unaware as he didn’t want to have people freak out. Little did he know, it was his awareness.<br />
<br />
Adam posted up at a bench that was facing down the walkway. He could see several different store fronts including Lululemon in the middle. He decided to focus on it and the Starbucks on the corner. <br />
<br />
When Adam came to from his slight disorientation. He checked his surroundings. “Hmm the Lululemon is still on the corner and my Starbucks in the middle.” Thought Adam as he looked down. He was still wearing his black polo uniform with the Starbucks logo on it and his green apron folded up in his lap which was covered by his work khakis. Everything seemed right. <br />
<br />
Adam selected the Target across the street and his Starbucks. As he came to, he looked at his Target outlet store and checked to see if his generic red polo and khakis were still the same. He looked over at the Starbucks Supercenter and couldn’t tell it was any different. <br />
<br />
Adam lastly selected the Chilis on the corner of the main road and his Target. Within seconds he looked to see the small Target was still on the corner and his Chili’s restaurant location was still in the middle of the mall. His uniform was still the black polo with the chilis logo. Adam moved the dial to the hour dial to the 2. Adam wanted to try more with the watch but decided he should head back inside. He saw Jeff coming out of the restaurant for his break which means Adam’s was almost over. His section would probably get customers soon. <br />
<br />
As Adam walked up to the restaurant, he was passing by Jeff who was a bit of a social recluse. He struggled talking to girls even just as friends. Adam knows he has a crush on Destiny the bartender but Adam knows there is no competition. He did feel bad for Jeff though. As he was thinking this and walking by Jeff, he clicks the watch. Nothing seems to happen but he’s sure something is different. The thing Adam didn’t realize is that 2 is a hybrid of 12 that keeps the person the same but swaps the life around them. <br />
<br />
When Adam walks in, he tries to sneak in while avoiding Destiny’s gaze. She only had a couple at the bar and had more time to chat. “Hey Adam! How was your break?” Destiny said while smiling at Adam. Adam weirdly raises his had and waves while lightly saying “good” before turning the corner quickly. Adam really liked Destiny but didn’t know how to communicate with women. He also knew that was Jeff’s girlfriend and couldn’t intervene. Adam’s section got sat and he went to introduce himself. Unfortunately for Adam, they ordered cocktails which meant he had to talk to Destiny. <br />
<br />
After he placed his drink order, he went to the bar to grab the drinks. “Sorry hun, I got a bit behind and haven’t started your drinks.” Destiney said while hastily picking up bottles l, flipping them, and pouring drinks. Before Adam could respond Jeff pulled up next to him and blurted out how excited he was for tonight. Destiny giggled ran over to him and gave a quick kiss before moving back to pouring. Adam felt sick but couldn’t say anything, even if he wanted to. Jeff elbowed Adam and whispered, “we are trying for a baby.” <br />
<br />
Adam did whatever he could to avoid hearing this as he played with the watch. He moved the hour hand to 5 and the minute hand to the aware side. He looked up at Destiny pouring drinks and the couple at the bar. Adam clicked the button and realized the change.<br />
<br />
The white male with blonde hair in his 30s sitting at the bar was dressed like a business man who just got off work. He was with a woman about the same age with curled brunette hair and business attire as well. Once Adam came to he now saw the woman was exactly the same but the man was now wearing the same chilis polo the employees were wearing. He kissed the girl and walked around to join Destiny behind the counter. Destiny and the man started talking like they worked the bar for years. Adam determined it swapped roles of Destiny into the man. He now was a chilis bartender like her.<br />
<br />
Adam couldn’t believe it! The watch was working. Jeff quickly moved the hour hand back to 12 and thought about the wife of the man and Destiny. When reality snapped back the wife was now standing where Destiny was and had her hair tied back into a ponytail and wearing Destiny’s Chilis polo uniform. You could tell by the way she filled out the uniform that the woman was a bit larger set. Destiney now sat where the lady was sitting and had her hair curled and wearing the business attire the woman was wearing. She was now sipping a cocktail. <br />
<br />
Adam realized he must have actually swapped something with Jeff and moved the dial to 2. He focused on Jeff and hit the button. When he came to, he realized he was Destiny’s boyfriend and they must have swapped personalities and memories. Adam began to realize they may not have actually worked at a Chilis and ended up here by accident. <br />
<br />
Adam was going to go talk to Destiny when Tara (the woman in Destiny’s life) interrupted him. “Hey babe, can we stop by the grocery store after work. I need to get a pregnancy test for our special night.” Adam had this feeling of fear wash over him as he remembered he swapped Destiny. She must have now been in the life of Tara. “How do I know her name?” Adam thought as he realized she’s technically his girlfriend. Tara interjected with a “wait, one last kiss before you walk away.” Adam did not want to and quickly tried to focus and push the button.</p>
