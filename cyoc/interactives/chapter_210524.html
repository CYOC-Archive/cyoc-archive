<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“WHAT THE HELL!?” Blake shouted, but not at Peter, at Jane’s body, “how DARE you suggest that MY boyfriend is GAY! He is MY boyfriend, how on Earth could he possibly be GAY!?”<br />
<br />
“I really was not expecting this,” Jane’s body said, ignoring Blake entirely, “this completely throws off my usual plan… but I LOVE IT!” She said with delight,<br />
“DON’T YOU DARE IGNORE ME YOU BITCH!” Blake screamed at Jane’s body.<br />
She turned her head, facing Blake. She looked her dead in the eyes with the expression wiped clean off of her face. Her eyes glowed for just a few seconds before returning to their natural dead colour.<br />
<br />
Blake felt weird. She felt the cold stare spread all over her body. Everyone began to stare at her as a loud growl came from her stomach.<br />
“Uhh…” she groaned, grabbing her stomach in discomfort. Before too long, everyone’s eyes widened as her face suddenly bloated. Her cheeks grew as if filled with water in some way. Her entire face grew larger and larger, getting fatter and fatter, “w-what the he-ell ish g-gohh…” she tried to speak, but as her face grew larger, it made it increasingly more difficult. It grew until it had completely sealed her mouth shot. Her eyes were wide with terror.<br />
Now that her face was fattened, her body came next. Her belly of course began, getting larger like someone had stuffed a basketball inside her stomach, then pumped that basketball more and more and more and more! Her belly itself was almost the size of her before she began. Her butt filled more and more, getting larger by the second. Like her stomach, it was growing to ridiculous proportions. Following her expanding rear, her breasts also began to inflate. They grew bigger, like the rest, bursting button after button off of her top until it was held on only by a few thin strips of fabric. The rest of her body followed, blowing her up into a giant inflated woman that hardly fit into her own corner of the room. She finally stopped.<br />
<br />
“You see, what I typically do is have what you may call a ‘breeder’, such as yourself,” she smiled at Peter, “and someone to take in that seed, such as ‘her’, “ she pointed at Blake, still barely able to move, letting out a few small groans or moans, “considering our situation here, I thought what’s better than an extra storage tank!” She finished, biting her lip once again.<br />
“S-so… she’s gonna be used as a tank?” Peter asked, looking at his former girlfriend (if you could really call her that), “to store… what exactly?” He asked,<br />
“Not really sure,” Jane’s body replied, “but I’m sure she’ll come in handy sometime in the future,” she finished, winking at Stacy as if she was hinting at something.<br />
<br />
“Now what to do with you?” She said, looking back at Peter, “I’m sure you could be a suitable option for an eternity of pleasure. Would you like that?” She asked,<br />
“W-what is… what does that mean?” He asked,<br />
“Allow me to enlighten you,” she replied, opening her eyes to him. Revealing once again that red glow.<br />
The scared look on his face faded, replacing itself with a look of relief and excitement. As he stared deep into the eyes, his body started changing. His scrawny little nerd body started growing bigger, gaining more and more muscle. His clothes began to tear as his cock revealed itself, growing to become an absolute python beside the tennis ball sized testicles he was now sporting. His legs thickened with muscle, his arms, his torso and chest. His shoulders got so wide they tore what was left of his shirt perfectly in half. He closed his eyes finally, falling to the ground. A massive, giant hunk of a man in his place. He took what remained of his previous being, his nerdy glasses, and dropped them on the ground. Peter was gone,<br />
“I want to go there…” he said, “I want nothing more in my life than to pleasure men.”<br />
Jane’s body looked at him with delight in her eyes,<br />
“Good,” she said, “then why don’t you take the bloated bitch over there to store all that useful cum of yours?”<br />
“Of course,” he said, pulling himself up. It was like he was in a trance. Peter was no longer the shy, cute, witty, nerdy friend everyone once knew. He’d seen pleasure, and he was hooked. He walked over to Blake, who was trying her best to scream and failing completely. Jane’s body held up her hand towards Blake’s bloated body and it began to shrink in size. It was simply the size of a basketball by the time she was done, still very aware of what was going on.<br />
Peter looked at Jane’s body with a look of pleasure on his mind, “take me there,”<br />
“You can take yourself, I got a few other problems to attend to!”<br />
<br />
The ground suddenly opened beneath Peter, still holding Blake in his arms. She was trying so hard to scream, to shout, to do anything other than make a faint moan from beneath her sealed lips. Peter disappeared into the portal that appeared in the ground.<br />
<br />
“And then there were three,” Jane’s body said, grinning.</p>
