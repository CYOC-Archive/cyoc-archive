<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think it’s starting Bob-“ Jim screamed cupping his chest as he felt it expand although for the time being it retained its definition. He was dreading the return of his moobs.<br />
<br />
“Arrrgh” roared Bobby as he too felt a familiar sharp cramp in his stomach causing him to lean forward and grab his ample belly in pain. Through the pain he noticed that his body mass was shifting. His gut was somewhat receding through his grip. He looked down as far as he could between his moobs relieved to see his belly retreating if ever so slightly. The crevice between his moobs was also growing wider and his view less obscured. His nipples were decreasing in size and he could sense more firmness returning to his chest. He felt his feet, hands and limbs shrinking slightly as his fingers and toes became stubbier.<br />
<br />
“It worked! We’re changing back!” said Bobby in an upbeat tone amidst the painful spasms.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I guess…” replied Jim rather dryly as he saw his limbs, feet, hands and fingers elongating. He felt he was regaining some height as the room started feeling smaller. He anticipated with dread the start of the weight piling back on him.  He looked longingly at his feet for what he thought was the last time before they are eclipsed again by his belly.<br />
<br />
Both rushed to Jim’s full length mirror, the floorboards still creaking under Bobby’s heft.<br />
<br />
Bobby growled in pain as he started feeling a dull ache in the rest of his body. He saw his already wide back expand impossibly further out in the mirror. “Oh SHIT!” rumbled Bobby “something’s wrong – Arrgh” he winced in pain as his back widened further. Feeling a growing sensation in his buttocks Bobby quickly moved his hands to feel his butt-cheeks. He could feel his ass growing by the second, his thighs getting ever closer, packing on more muscle and bulk. If his thighs were touching before, now they were literally in competition between one another for space. His calves burst into growth as his ankles and feet grew even beefier and wider. What was happening? Jim must have really screwed up this time! His chest didn’t diminish any further but remained sizable and somewhat chubby just overflowing ever so slightly on the sides. He perceived a similar dull expanding ache in all his limbs, as more burly fat and husky muscle deposited itself in them. His arms were now significantly beefier than the old Bobby’s thighs had been; his fingers looking like stubby, stocky sausages.<br />
<br />
Jim looked on in the mirror relieved his old belly hadn’t already started to make its inevitable return. “Why are you sAAying that?” he replied in his old voice albeit in a higher register, half-hoping that Bobby was right.<br />
<br />
“Look at me. I’m GaAAaaINING not losing weight in my back, ass and limbs – “ bellowed Bobby in a husky version of his old voice.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t that what you wanted in the first place? Ahhh” added Jim in pain, still getting used to the voice change. Jim was still secretly praying this turned out as they had originally intended it to rather than changing everything back to normal. His chest hadn’t grown further but his pecs had just jutted out ever so slightly retaining their lean definition. Heck it actually looked better than Bobby’s old chest. But his hope faded fast as he saw his scalp hair darkening into a familiar brown in the mirror... but without lengthening! Bobby’s right; he’d screwed up big time!<br />
<br />
Bobby saw the pelt of hair already covering his body lighten to a golden hue but not receding. What the hell did Jim do? This was all he could think about. He became aware of an odd breeze on his head. He quickly touched his hairline in a frenzy as he looked in the mirror. His hand was met by full sandy blond hair that was coming off. But neither him nor Jim ever had a receding hairline? How could he be losing his hair? He started panicking. Bobby felt an expanding mass under his chin as he realised he was developing a double chin, which Jim’s body didn’t have despite his size. <br />
<br />
The ache moved to his face as it re-ordered itself to what Bobby hoped was its familiar configuration. Bobby’s face lengthened as his cheekbones became higher but his jaw remained square and his nose and brow remained quite prominent. Familiar dimples sprouted and yet he could feel his cheeks puffing up further with fat, rather than slimming down, as stubble thickened into a dense sandy blond beard on top of them. His features were now a coarser, brawny version of the old Bobby’s features; this is what Bobby would have looked like had he been a bruiser of a guy!  He growled “JIMMMMM WHAT DID YOU DO?!” as he stared at the bearish version of his old self in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jim watched in disbelief as his face contorted into something similar but not quite the same as his old features. It was as if his features had been reinterpreted in a more delicate manner. For one thing his face remained slim, his cheekbones slender and not buried under facial hair. His old large nose had started making a comeback but it then transformed into a narrow, smaller one with a slightly upturned tip. His brown eyes looked much bigger as his brow receded and his eyebrows lost their heaviness. Even Jim was now afraid that something was seriously wrong here. He looked like a boyish version of his old body; but even in his youth Jim had never been this skinny and smooth!<br />
<br />
The pain each was in started subsiding and their cries of pain died down. The sound of infomercials running in the background was now the only sound that could be heard. Staring blankly at the mirror were two speechless men in their boxers. One was blond, about 5’11”, wide and huskily built, out-of-shape with a bit of a belly, love-handles and a hint of man-boobs. He was an imposing sight, covered in a pelt of blond hair all over and had a mane of blond hair receding at the temples with heavy blond stubble covering his full cheeks. His accomplice was 5’7”, skinny, of slight built with gangly limbs but with a decently developed chest. He had a boyish fresh-faced look to him and a short crop of dense brown hair but was otherwise baby-smooth. Hadn’t they seen each other going through the transformation they would have never recognised each other, despite their old facial features remaining vaguely familiar.<br />
<br />
“OMG! What the hell happened?” exclaimed Bobby in a rough growl reminiscent of his old voice.<br />
<br />
“I guess my ‘fixer’ spell worked as we had intended the first spell to work.” Replied Jim secretly elated at the outcome in a higher register version of his old voice.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh…” was all Bobby could manage.<br />
<br />
“Why aren’t you happy this thing worked as you had wanted? We’re back in our old bodies but switched our physiques and ages. I guess this is what you would look like if you had my physique, and age but kept your supposedly better genetics.” Replied Jim dryly, recalling how Bobby had denounced his old body on the phone. <br />
<br />
“What? I was afraid you’d say that. If I have to be honest I was beginning to change my mind about wanting to be a big guy after being you for a few hours… But hang on you’re only 5 years older than I was Jim and my father is much older but still has a full head of hair?!”<br />
<br />
“Weren’t you listening? 5 years can make all the difference and don’t forget you’re no longer the old Bobby. I think both of us are now kind of mash ups between our old bodies and each other’s physiques. I look like a scrawny, smooth version of my old self. And your genes combined with the older, big-guy physique you agreed to swap for combined to give you your new appearance. To be honest your hairline isn’t too receded, your temples are just a bit more pronounced. I actually think it makes you look more distinguished -”<br />
<br />
“You think? Or is distinguished just another way to tell me I look old hahaa?“ Bobby joked trying to see humour in a situation he no longer wanted to be part of. <br />
<br />
Bobby waddled closer towards Jim’s full length mirror hearing the now familiar sound of floorboards creaking under his mass. His boxers were now strained even further at the seams trying to hold his huge husky thighs and ass.  His new body occupied the entirety of the mirror’s reflection.<br />
<br />
Staring back at him was a stout blond mountain of a man whose face was half covered by a thick sandy blond beard but whose facial features looked vaguely familiar. His beard defined his face from an otherwise undefined mass of chins on his neck.  He squinted and peered forward trying to spot the similarities between the old Bobby and the new Big Bob. His eyes were still his pale blue but they were now partially obscured by a pair of bushy eyebrows on a very pronounced brow. His previously small, smooth button nose was now wider and more pronounced with a bigger tip and a little bump on the bridge. The more he looked at himself the more he reminded himself of a cross between the old Jim and his Uncle Chuck. Come to think of it Uncle Chuck had a bit of a receded hairline. He actually still hadn’t got his head around the early male pattern baldness that had settled on his scalp.<br />
Looking at the rest himself and judging by the height of things he realised he had lost just a little bit of height since his time as Jim. Apparently his own genes had programmed him to be slightly shorter than Jim had been, even now he had Jim’s physiques. He still looked quite corpulent but his mass was huskier than Jim’s had been. He had an even more pronounced V-shaped taper to his body than Jim had ever had.<br />
<br />
“Quit hogging the mirror” a somewhat familiar voice quipped bringing him out of his pensive trance as he felt a little nudging on the left side of his sizable but firm gut . Big Bob turned his head to his left to see where that voice and pushing was coming from and he finally caught a glimpse of the new Jim trying to get Bobby to move aside with all his strength while trying to hold on to his tent-like boxers as they were slipping off . He had barely felt Jim, but Jim looked like he was giving it his all to move Bobby over. <br />
<br />
The new Jim was a smidgen taller than the old Bobby had been, about 5’7”, with a very slight build, a youthful look and was completely smooth. His limbs were relatively long and wiry for his build. His feet were long and narrow and his fingers long and gangly. He didn’t look a day older than 20, though Bobby knew for a fact Jim must have been around 25 years old now, since they had swapped both physiques and ages. He was rake thin although he did have some definition to his muscles especially his pecs which jutted out somewhat. “So with his genetics Jim always gets to have a prominent chest, even now that he has inherited my skinny guy physique!” chuckled Bobby to himself. Actually Jim’s slightly protruding decently-built chest looked good on him, Bobby had to admit to himself with a hint of jealousy. The old Bobby would have killed to have at least had some pec definition. There wasn’t an ounce of fat on the new Jim and his leanness only accentuated his angular jaw and delicate features further. <br />
<br />
Bobby was having difficulty reconciling the new image of Jim with the old one he was accustomed to. “Looking good there Jim, or should I say Little Jamie now hahaa” chuckled Bobby in his new low rumble.<br />
<br />
“Not too bad yourself Big Bob, though I’d take it easy on the sweets from now on if I were you L-O-L hahaa” came Jim’s retort in a somewhat higher register as he jiggled Bobby’s sizable belly. Whenever they had compared physiques in the past it had always been Bobby who had the nice and trim stomach, while he had been stuck with the blubbery gut and moobs. He had always been secretly envious of Bobby because of this and this was his main motivation to try the original spell. For as long as he could remember Jim had always had a gut; his ravenous appetite didn’t help especially after he stopped playing football in college. For the first time however the roles were reversed. Bobby was now the wobbly, tub-of-lard, while he had the lean flat stomach which in the right lighting even had a hint of abs!<br />
<br />
“I might actually get used to this” said the now Big Bob trying to take stock of the situation while trying to do some poses in the mirror. Whenever Bobby had tried to do a double biceps pose in his old body, he had always been ashamed of the ridiculously scrawny reflection that stared back at him especially when compared with Jim’s imposing poses. Jim had always laughed at his feeble attempts whenever they had compared poses at the gym. But now as the new Big Bob his double biceps pose was quite intimidating, even though his somewhat chubby mass, mainly his gut and chest, did wobble with his every movement.<br />
<br />
 “That’s the spirit!” chirped Jamie somewhat too cheerfully as he could hardly hide his glee at the spell’s outcome while staring in the mirror at his and Bobby’s new reflections. <br />
<br />
 “But hang on… How will I explain this to my family, at work – Wait I can’t go to work like this! They won’t recognise me… or you for that matter JAMIE!”<br />
<br />
“I think this second spell took care of that from the looks of it…” exclaimed Jamie as he pointed in amazement to an old picture on the wall of the two of them at the beach taken about 6 months earlier.<br />
<br />
“What the heck?!”<br />
<br />
Staring back at Bob was a picture of 2 men – one big and one skinny – in their swimming trunks and sunglasses only – beaming at the camera. That much was familiar to Bob as he recalled their last holiday in Florida. However the bigger man who was in his early thirties, was not Jim but a blond husky bear of a man, strongly-built if a little out-of-shape with a full blond beard and pelt, a bit of belly and an inkling of man-boobs. He recognised this man as the same one that had been staring back at him in the mirror just then. Next to him in the picture was a facsimile of the new Jamie – somewhat short, skinny and of slight built with gangly limbs but a decently developed chest, baby-smooth and with a fresh youthful face framed by a short crop of chestnut hair.<br />
<br />
“So for the rest of the world I’ve always been the big guy and you’re the skinny one?”<br />
<br />
“Seems like it! We got our wish to have each other’s physiques. Be careful what you wish for, that’s what they say, right?!”</p>
