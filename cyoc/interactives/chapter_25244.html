<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jesse had a feeling that Josh was getting tired as he was slowing down. They seemed to have covered a decent distance. Josh stopped and Jesse climbed off of him and walked in front on him.</p>

<p>"Are you still in there Josh?" Jesse asked as she petted Josh's long face. Josh nodded.</p>

<p>Jesse felt something tingling above her rear end. She also felt something pushing against the top of her pants. Choosing to ignore it, she looked at her chest as she wiped her brow.</p>

<p>"It's hot out here," she said. She saw that Josh was sweating. His ears were twitching back and forth as flies buzzed around them. Josh was developing an odor. Jesse still couldn't believe what Josh had done with that mare. Her best bud had mated with a horse!</p>

<p>With a sigh, Jesse took her shirt off. <i>Might as well get a better look at these things.</i> Josh brayed as Jesse stood there topless and tied her shirt around her waist. She looked to see that her breasts were a decent size and round. <i>I never expected to see these things on my own body. Man, I have to find a way to change back. The rest of the guys would never let something like <b>this</b> go.</i></p>

<p>Looking at Josh, Jesse sighed. "Yes Josh, I have boobs, I get it." The tingling above her rear end was getting annoying. Jesse finally unbuttoned her pants and slid them down her legs. She saw that her legs were now hairless and well shaped. She felt something free itself and turned her head. She gasped when she saw a short tail growing just above her rear end.</p>

<p>"Holy shit!" she screamed. Josh brayed. <i>Oh come on! You turn me into a babe and then a donkey! That's just sick. I have to get out of here!</i> Josh brayed louder, Jesse realizing that sounds around her were louder. <i>No, please don't let it be that!</i> Jesse reached up and touched her ears, finding that they were now long and furred. <i>Damn it.</i></p>

<p>"Okay Josh, time to get out of here!" Jesse said. An idea entered her mind. Perhaps the island was dulling her inhibitions, she wasn't sure. She took the rest of her clothes off and looked at her naked form. Josh brayed at her again before licking her belly. Jesse giggled at the sensation. Shaking her head, she climbed back onto Josh's back. <i>I'm a naked chick riding a donkey while turning into one. That's one for the books.</i></p>

<p>Josh started running again. Jesse felt invigorated as the wind flew over her body and Josh's mane tickled her groin. Jesse could feel her tail behind her, she tried to ignore it. Jesse saw that the light hair on her arms was growing thicker and turning a dark gray. She shook her head. <i>No, I'm not going to be a Jenny. I will resist this!</i></p>

<p>Jesse unfortunately didn't realize that many others had come and gone before her, all thinking the same thought. <i>They're all donkeys now, just like you're going to be.</i> Shaking her head, Jesse forced that thought out even as she saw lighter gray fur sprouting on her belly. Josh's odor was starting to excite her. For a few seconds, she wanted him to stop and mount her. <i>No, that's the Jenny talking, don't let it win, you're a human being. Even if I have to be a woman, that's a million times better then being a donkey. It won't be so bad.</i> Jesse considered her arrival home. She pictured telling her parents that their son was now their daughter and they had a pet donkey.</p>

<p>"Don't worry Josh, if we get out of here, even if you don't change back, I'll take care of you. I'll make sure you get to live on my Aunt and Uncles farm," Jesse said. She petted between Josh's ears. "They have lots of mares there. Think of it, no job to worry about, lots of room to run and play." <i>Lucky bastard.</i></p>

<p>Jesse felt dizzy and asked Josh to stop. She got off of him and cradled her head. When the sensation passed, she saw that her fingernails were growing longer and turning black. As well, the fur on her arms belly and now her legs was longer. She was sweating and much to her embarrassment, starting to smell like Josh. <i>No, I'm not a Jenny!</i> Josh brayed. Looking at Josh, Jesse shook her head in an attempt to push out the desire she was feeling. <i>He's my best friend. I don't care what we look like on the outside, I could never do that with him!</i> Jesse felt her tail swishing back and forth. Another look at her hands showed her that her fingers were almost gone and that her now black fingernails were merging. Her face started to ache. The breasts that she'd developed less then an hour ago were still on her chest however Jesse had a feeling they soon wouldn't be.</p>

<p>"No, we have to get out of ..." a urge from within arose to the surface. Jesse let out a loud bray to which Josh responded with a bray of his own. <i>No, I didn't just bray.</i> Another urge had her braying again. She cupped her face with what were more hooves then hands. Her face was pushing out and growing longer. She looked down to see her toes were turning black and merging. Her skin was becoming almost impossible to see under what was now a gray pelt of fur. Her breasts started shrinking.</p>

<p>"Please, don't do this to me. Josh, do something!" Jesse cried. Suddenly letting go of her face, Jesse felt her center of gravity change as her chest and belly started to barrel outwards. Her ribcage felt as though something were trying to break free of it. Every muscles in her body ached. <i>No, this isn't supposed to happen!</i></p>

<p>Jesse fell forward, landing on what were now hooves. The bones in her neck rearranged, she was now a quadruped! She tried to speak, but only a low pitched moan came out. She cringed as the rest of the changes coursed through her body. Her belly was now large and that of a donkey. Her tail swished back and forth in protest and her ears twitched. Her face grew longer until, if Jesse could see a mirror, she would have seen that it was the head of a donkey. Her head hair darkened and shrank into the mane of a donkey.</p>

<p>Braying uncontrollably, Jesse felt the urge to panic. She looked back and forth as her body seemed to finish its changes. <i>No, I'm not a Jenny! Oh God, this can't be happening!</i> She felt Josh nuzzle her from behind and turned to see her former friend. She felt shame over her new form. It was a reminder of her mistake of coming to this island. Now, she and Josh were trapped in the bodies of beasts. <i>No, I can't give up. We can still get out of here. We can both live on that farm!</i></p>

<p>Jesse looked at Josh and considered her next move.</p></p>
