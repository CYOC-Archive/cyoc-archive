<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What Eric saw scared the shit out of him. He couldn't believe what he was seeing but right there across the room was a very large gray wolf with its white teeth bared and yellow eyes shimmering at the light of his flashlight. Eric could see that the fearsome creature looked hungry--very hungry--and was slowly approaching him.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Uuuh... nice doggie?&quot; Eric turned around and bolted straight back for the dining hall. When he was halfway across the room, he accidentally bumped into one of the chairs, twisted his ankle, and crashed on the floor. &quot;Fucking hell!&quot; he screamed scrambling to get up, but as he was about to move on, his face contorted at the pain when he put some weight on his sprained ankle. &quot;Shit!&quot;
<br />

<br />
He looked behind him to check if the wolf had followed him into the room and was relieved to see that the beast hadn’t. Imagine his shock when he discovered that the wolf already in front of him. &quot;How the hell did he get there so fast?&quot;
<br />

<br />
With nowhere to run and no place to hide, Eric grabbed one of the chairs from the table to defend himself. When the wolf was near enough, he would try to smash it with the chair and hopefully one of the broken pieces could be used as a weapon. He stared directly into the animal’s eyes and steeled himself for the inevitable attack; he wasn’t going down without a fight. 
<br />

<br />
The next few minutes were tense. The light of the full moon streamed in through the windows and the scene would have been a great study in chiaroscuro if it were not for the confrontation happening right there and then. Every time the wolf inched closer, Eric would use the chair to force it back. While anticipating the wolf’s next move, he began to notice something odd about the creature, something not quite right. It was as if it was right in front of him, but not. It was then when he saw that the animal cast no shadow. Without warning, the wolf suddenly lunged straight from him and Eric instinctively used the chair to shield himself.
<br />

<br />
Then right before his very eyes, the wolf vanished in mid-leap. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;What the fuck just happened?&quot; Eric exclaimed in utter shock, his heart pounding from the adrenaline rush. When there was no trace of the beast, he dropped the chair to his side and collapsed on the floor in relief, visibly shaken by the entire episode. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Man, the place is screwed up,&quot; he thought after resting for some time and letting his heartbeat return to normal. &quot;We better get the hell out of here before something else happens. Now where’s my flashlight?&quot; He scanned his immediate surroundings and spotted it near the doors he came through clear across the room. He stood up and walked a couple of meters when he realized a couple of things: first, how did he see his flashlight so well in this darkened room, and second, why wasn’t his ankle hurting anymore?
<br />

<br />
At that thought, a sharp pain stabbed him in the stomach and he doubled over from the sheer agony. Clutching his abdomen and curled up in a ball, Eric felt the pain gradually spread throughout his entire body traveling down his limbs up to his fingers and toes. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Aaaaaaaargh!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Eric tried to stand but couldn’t find the strength to do so. He instead opted to fight through the pain, pull himself towards the flashlight, and, from there, find a way to get help from his friends. Upon reaching for his target, he saw that his hands were have gotten very hairy. Also, he could see everything in the room clearly even without his flashlight. That was then his shirt, pants, and his shoes became very tight. Eric couldn’t do anything as his arms and legs began to extend and thicken, his body expanding to a point where his clothes started to tear at the strain.
<br />

<br />
&quot;What’s... what’s happening to me?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Eric was surprised at the sound of his own voice; it was deep and guttural. He tore off his tattered shirt and saw that his entire body was getting hairier by the second. He could feel the follicles on his face sprout and lengthen. He attempted to stand again and this time he was able to, but when he looked at his feet, his shoes had already been ripped apart by two huge paws that evidently belonged to him. Flesh-tearing claws tipped his hands and feet.
<br />

<br />
Next, he could literally feel his face reshape itself to a more lupine configuration. His nose shrank and was pushed forward by his extending jaws. His teeth grew longer and sharper. His ears became more pointed. But what made Eric more worried was he felt he was losing control of himself. Something in his subconscious was forcing its way out and overpowering his personality. He struggled to retain whatever control he had left but soon even those attempts were futile. At the end of the transformation, all traces of Eric had been consumed by the feral nature of his new form. Positioning himself erect, the werewolf let out a powerful howl. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Awwoooooo!&quot;</p>
