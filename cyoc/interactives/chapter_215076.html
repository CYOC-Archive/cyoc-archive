<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The group that had come in to Heiya Island&#39;s hospital and conversion center were a rather &quot;plump&quot; group and one that Manami didn&#39;t expect to be greeting. They were friendly and kind, but it wasn&#39;t something she expected. Granted, she&#39;d put on a little bit of weight while carrying her and Tsukuyomi&#39;s pups, but a healthy metabolism and some workouts between their naps and shifts at the hospital got her back in shape, which often had Tsukuyomi interested in her as well. It made for a happy marriage between the two Wolf Animalians and a happy family with their sons and daughter. Though, the growth of their family and the report that Shuixing of the Five Elements was presently pregnant, came as a reminder on how limited the physical space was at Heiya Island. It was something that even had Tsuku and Ami off scouting this this new island while everyone else was watching the Animalia Ambassadoria coverage of the Year of the Rabbit competition.<br />
<br />
And the group that had come in certainly looked like they needed more space. Manami could accept that Animalians were often bigger than Humans and took up more space as a result, but she&#39;d also found that for the most part, all their sizes were proportional. Their frames were all about the same, but the size really only scaled up based on the size of the animal their form was based on. In this, Kumiyo, as a Tylosaurus Dinotopian and Heiya Island&#39;s largest current resident would still scale down to the Human norm if she were shrunk down to mat a Human in terms of height and weight. The group that had come in didn&#39;t fit into that category and were clearly rather round in shape, and barely fitting into the waiting area&#39;s chairs for Humans. And this came particularly true one Manami thought over things in Japan. Manami knew there were many reasons for people to gain weight, but outside of sumo wrestlers, she didn&#39;t think that issue was that common in Japan and yet of the group of four people that had arrived, three looked like they could compete in that sport by size and mass while the last wasn&#39;t that far behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are all doing well?&quot; Manami asked carefully as she looked to the first of the group, a young man who had requested to become a Stellars Sea Eagle.<br />
<br />
&quot;As well as I can be,&quot; the man admitted with a rather sheepish voice, &quot;though looking for something new... and break old habits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Old habits?&quot; Manami asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did a lot of computer programming work and they kept me busy,&quot; the man explained and sounding a bit embarrassed, &quot;and it often had me just getting fast food... and I must admit that the Americans do come up with some tasty ideas... So, I ate, but because I didn&#39;t get a lot of free time, I ended up putting on weight and got too lazy to break out of that cycle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Manami listened in as there were a few voices of agreement as the others added in their reasons and what lead them to putting on weight. Some of it was enjoying junk food and the like, though one had actually thought about sumo wrestling for a time but found he didn&#39;t have the time for all the physical training sumo wrestlers also did. Some of this was a small surprise to Manami, but she figured they&#39;d all had to have found time or an increased desire for change and just their reason for becoming Animalians. That would go a long way and would help them move forward as Animalians, though as she escorted the first man to the changing room where one of the Horizon doctors on the island would handle the administration of the shots for the conversions, Manami also had more recognition on the issues that the island would face in the near future.<br />
<br />
For the island was relatively small in size. It was larger than some of the individual islets at Mieni Atoll, but it was still well smaller than an island like Okinawa and had proven to provide for a rather complicated lifestyle. Adding too many people would only further complicate things, which would be something that raise the requirements for the new colony and upgrade ideas for Japan. One was the continued apartment idea in Tokyo, though that was still working through the necessary logistics related to building there and that was likely be something that took too long to really rely on. There was also the contact that were being made for a colony in Hokkaido, but much like the new island that was presently being scouted, that was also very new. Which all meant those things would take time, but for the short term, at least, things would be fine on Heiya Island, and Manami hoped that these new Animalians would make use of what conversion would do.<br />
<br />
And the choices the four had made would hopefully work out toward maintaining that sort of change. The first became a Stellar&#39;s Sea Eagle, and while it wasn&#39;t a small bird, it would still require a fair amount of energy to fly and retaining the ability to fly was something that kept all of the flying Animalians fairly active, regardless of whether they were Bird Animalians, Bat Animalians, or Pterosaur Dinotopians. Manami figured that the first had chosen that eagle if only to fly and would try to find time for the related exercises in time that came with it. The second became an Asian Small Clawed Otter and had explained his choice because of some clips on YouTube showing someone raising &quot;pet otters,&quot; and which the man thought were Asian Small Clawed Otters. It also got some mention of them being cute. The third made a similar decision to become a Japanese Weasel. The last made a different choice and going for an animal not found in Japan or Asia. He chose to become a subspecies of Eastern Racer, specifically the Eastern Yellow-Bellied Racer, and going by the reasoning that any snake with the word &quot;racer&quot; in its name had to be fast.</p>
