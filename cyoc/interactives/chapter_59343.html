<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kalena sat down on the couch and took the bottle out, looking it over. She found a little faded out label on it that possibly read TF-Salve, and a spray nozzle on top. Before she could do anything with it though, through the doorway to the kitchen Tanya walked. Seems she was here today, instead of being out like normal. &quot;Hey there squirt, what do you got?&quot; She asks, reaching down and plucking the bottle out of Kalena's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I don't know what it is, I just found it.&quot; Kalena responds, a little distressed at Tanya taking it from her. &quot;Come on, give it back. I just found it.&quot; She said again, reaching Tanya's way from the couch.<br />
<br />
Before Tanya could respond, her pocket vibrated and rang, and she reached in, pull out her cell phone. She gave Kalena a 'one moment' sign with her hand, and answered the call. &quot;Hey babe, how are ya?&quot; It was Rob, her boyfriend. She had a wide grin on her face, and kept the salve in her hand and idly looking over it while she talked. &quot;yeah, I can talk right now. Why don't you come over instead.... oh, ok sure, what do you want to... what?&quot; Her face seemed to just drop, the grin disappearing and being replaced by a mixed look of shock and horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Was all she seemed able to do, a sound of pleading in her voice. Her face suddenly changed again, becoming something more akin to rage, clenching her fist. &quot;Cause I am a bitch?! I am not a bitch! Who the hell would even say that?! I-&quot; She suddenly stopped talking and started coughing as her clenched hand had set off the bottle, and a big spray of the stuff blasted her in the face. She dropped it and tried to talk as she coughed, doubling over a bit. &quot;No, Rob... *hack cough* I'm n*wheeze* a bitch!&quot; She continued to cough, and dropped her phone. The screen showed that the call had ended.<br />
<br />
Tears welled up in her eyes as she tumbled back wards, luckily landing in a chair, and finally began to get control of her coughing. It was merely morphing though, turning from a hacking fit into a crying fit. Tears were streaming down her face as she wept. &quot;Why me? Why a bitch? Who calls me a bitch?&quot; She asked to no one in particular through her crying. Kalena still sat off to the side, being rather uncomfortable now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uhh... Tanya, if it makes you, um... feel any better, I like dogs.&quot; She gave a sheepish grind Tanya's way. The older looked up, sniffing a bit, then went back to crying. This did not make Kalena feel better. As she wept, her cries started to sound strange, sounding more and more like whining instead of just crying.<br />
<br />
Kalena looked on a bit more curiously as she heard this shift in sound, and watched as Tanya's hair parted at the sides of her head. She gasped under her breath, as she say her sitter's ears poking out at slight points, and continuing to push up and grow to greater points. The whines of Tanya became more apparent, and started to take on a canine like feel to them.<br />
<br />
Her growing, pointed ears flattened down as she leaned forward and stopped her crying for a bit, sniffling now as she reached behind her and half turned. &quot;Oh god *sniff* what now? *sniffle* What is poking me?&quot; She half cried out as she reached down over her butt, feeling around her tail bone. She didn't find anything actually poking her, but she did find a bulge under the cloth of her jeans. This caused her stop for a moment, as she twisted more to look, with a mild groan of pain. &quot;Oh god, what is THAT!?&quot; She shouted out in shock, as she say the bulge swelling, and with small pained yelp from her, her pants tore and the knobby, fleshy bulge pushed out.<br />
<br />
She watched in horror as it grew, her ears atop her head still changing unnoticed. It started to curl up, and when it twitched she jumped out of the chair, turning in a circle to watch it, and letting Kalena get a sight of it. It was still growing fast, and it began to itch as little brown hairs started to poke up on it. &quot;Ow!... itchy...&quot; She says, reaching down and grabbing and scratching at it. She still didn't seem to notice her ears, as they had become modest sized triangles on her ears, the tips flopping over a bit, while the same brown hairs, more fur actually, started to grow on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god... oh god... it's... it's a tail?!&quot; She cried out again, as the tail slowly started to pop and stop, thick brown fur covering it, and it trying to curl down between her legs. Tanya looked back up, and caught her reflection in the mirror. She looked on, mouth agape, as she saw her ears in the reflection, big floppy dog ears. They flattened down almost immediately as she let out a very loud and fearful canine like whine. &quot;Oh my god... What's happening...&quot; She released her tail to reach up and rub those brown dog ears. &quot;Tail... ears... dog ears...&quot; She gasped quite suddenly, and looked back at her curled tail, then at her phone. &quot;Oh god, I'm... I've got a tail and ears... Like a dog... a bitch...&quot; She almost looked ready to cry again, but whined loudly. She seemed to notice it this time, and snapped her hands to her mouth, whimpering through her fingers. &quot;What's happening to me?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalena could only watch on, but had a more clear mind at the moment. She remembered Tanya spraying herself while talking on the phone, and calling herself a bitch. She may be only thirteen, but she knew what a bitch was. She was about to talk to Tanya again, when the dog eared woman suddenly gasped again, and spun around to look at the new changing feature on her...</p>
