<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin and Ty were finally driving home after a fun afternoon at the pool party with all the friends from school. They had a wonderful time, of course, since Ty used his magical powers to the fullest on their friends, and transformed all of them while they were swimming and hanging around the pool area. <br />
<br />
The two boys were tired and hungry, and they were longing to get home so they could take a shower and change and relax for the rest of the evening. While driving, Dustin’s little SUV passed two highway patrol cars, which were parked on an empty parking lot, facing the street. Both cars suddenly pulled on to the road and followed Dustin’s car, with lights flashing.<br />
<br />
“Maybe we can stop somewhere and get a pizza?” Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we can get… Uh oh…” Dustin sighed.<br />
<br />
Dustin pulled over as the police cars pulled right behind him, and one of the officers got out and walked up to Dustin’s window.<br />
<br />
“Uhhmm… Good afternoon, officer….” Dustin said, humbly, as he lowered his window when the officer walked up to his side of the window.<br />
<br />
“Can I see your license and proof of insurance, please?” the officer asked him, in a gruff tone of voice. <br />
<br />
Dustin removed his driver’s license out of his wallet and he took his proof of insurance card out of his glove compartment, as Ty looked on with a slightly concerned look on his face. He then handed the two documents to the officer, who slowly walked back to his patrol car, and sat down in his seat.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong? Didn’t you take care of all your papers?” Ty asked Dustin.<br />
<br />
“Well, I think I did…” he replied, when the officer walked back.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Hanson…” the officer said to him. “You license tag has expired last October, and your insurance card is not up-to-date. I’m going to have to give you a ticket for driving with an expired license tag and for driving in an uninsured vehicle, which is a State violation. Your license is suspended as of right now. You will have to come with me to the station in order to complete some paperwork.” <br />
<br />
“What?” Dustin gasped.<br />
<br />
“No way!” Ty added.<br />
<br />
“Please step out of the car, sir!” the officer said.<br />
<br />
“But, officer! I just got the bill! I just need to pay it! I got the bill the other day, and…” Dustin explained, before the officer cut him off.<br />
<br />
“Please step out of the car! Both of you!” the officer ordered.<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin quietly got out of the car and climbed into the back seat of the officer’s vehicle, while two officers in a second vehicle were watching, which was why Ty decided not to try anything magical. There were too many people watching, and Ty wanted to wait a little bit, before doing anything using his powers.<br />
<br />
The officer then turned to his partner.<br />
<br />
“Joe, we need to take these guys to the station and take care of paperwork.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, Frank. Lead the way… I have to be there anyway because I’m working with the K-9 unit this evening and we’re getting a few new German shepherds to train as police dogs…”<br />
<br />
This gave Ty an idea. He just had to be patient….<br />
<br />
Once they had arrived at the station, Dustin and Ty were led to a large desk in a small office with no windows. The officer, named Frank, sat down and started filling out some paperwork. Then he handed these papers to Dustin to sign, as Ty looked on.<br />
<br />
“What’s this?” Dustin asked him.<br />
<br />
“Your citation for you to sign. You must pay two-hundred and fifty Dollars for driving with insurance and for driving with an expired license tag. You have thirty days to pay this fee, or else you must appear in court and face me before a judge. If you go to court and lose the case, then your fine will go up to five-hundred Dollars.” Officer Frank explained coolly.<br />
<br />
“What? That’s highway robbery!” Dustin exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Then, you shouldn’t drive with expired tags, Mr. Hanson!” Frank fired back.<br />
<br />
“So… I have to pay this fine?” Dustin asked him again.<br />
<br />
“Yes, or else show up in court and face me! And… I will certainly be there!” Frank assured him.<br />
<br />
That last statement got Ty thinking, especially when he saw Frank’s partner, Joe, walking past the small office with a leash in his hand and a German Shepherd walking in front of him.<br />
<br />
Ty examined the big, heavy-set police officer quietly. Frank was a large man, about six-foot-three and fifty-three years old, and he had a large belly. He was tall and wide, with a round head and a few gray hairs on top and a thick, bushy mustache.  <br />
<br />
“What if… Dustin shows up in court, and Frank is there, but not as a human being, but as a dog?” Ty pondered to himself. Ty realized that if Dustin showed up but Frank didn’t, he wouldn’t have to pay anything at all! Ty just had to think of the right time to put his plan to work!<br />
<br />
Ty decided to get up and wander around the police station while Dustin was arguing with Frank the police officer about paying his fine. Ty realized that if there was some way he could get Frank to get away from his desk and in one of the other rooms, then Ty could use his power and perhaps transform him somehow. <br />
<br />
Ty got up and walked down the hall and passed the restrooms. He went in and washed his hands, before he came out and continued to stroll down the hall. Right next to the bathrooms there was a break room, for he saw a long table with several chairs in the center of the room, and then off to one side there was a large coffee bar containing a coffee machine and a water fountain. There were several plastic coffee cups stacked up neatly on the coffee bar, including containers with cream and sugar. <br />
<br />
The break room would have been an ideal place for Ty to lure Frank to and to transform him, except for the fact that Ty spotted someone sitting on a chair on the far end of the table. Ty quietly entered the room and acted as if he was going to prepare a cup of coffee for himself. Then he turned around and realized that the person, who was sitting at the end of the table, was a teenage boy.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, isn’t this a weird place for a kid like you to be studying?” Ty said to the boy. The boy appeared to be reading from a book and he was taking notes in a notebook, which lay before him on the coffee table.<br />
<br />
“Oh… Yeah…” the boy replied shyly. “My dad works here and I come here every day to do my homework after school…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that makes sense!” Ty replied. “My name is Ty. What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“I’m Jake!” the boy replied. “I really like it here a lot!”<br />
<br />
Jake seemed to be short but stocky. He looked like he was about eight years old, even though he seemed to be rather athletic. He was wearing shorts and a tank top and sneakers. He wasn’t skinny, but he certainly wasn’t fat either. He appeared to already have some muscle on him.<br />
<br />
Ty strolled over to the chair, which was opposite the spot where Jake was sitting, and he sat down there so he was facing the teen.<br />
<br />
“So… What do you want to do when you grow up, Jake?” Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
“You kidding me? I wanna be a police officer, just like my dad!” the boy replied confidentially. “I want to be a big, strong, and muscular guy who walks around wearing a black uniform all day long! I can’t wait!”<br />
<br />
Ty just stared at the eight-year-old boy with a sly grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Why wait, Jake?” Ty chuckled. “You can be a cop today… Like, right now! Stand up, dude!”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Stand up!”<br />
<br />
Jake put his pencil down and moved the chair back from the table. Then he got up from the chair and walked towards the wall behind him, but he was still facing Ty so that Ty had a clear view of him.<br />
<br />
Then Jake’s body began to stretch! His legs began to widen and stretch out, at the same time! His arms also lengthened as well, while his entire torso began to fill out and grow in every direction. Basically, Jake was experiencing a tremendous growth spurt, all at once!<br />
<br />
Jake’s hands and feet grew at an alarming rate! His feet almost burst out of his socks and his sneakers, but Ty’s magic allowed his shoes to grow along with his feet at the same time. His sneakers changed into nice black boots, and grew from size 7 to size 13. His hands doubled in size and his arms became long and muscular, with big biceps and triceps the size of melons. Jake’s small frame ballooned into a large, wide and vast torso with massive pecs and a six-pack of abdominals. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, Jake’s calves inflated into huge soccer balls and his quads became pillars of muscle. His t-shirt stretched all the way into a long-sleeve shirt that covered his entire upper body and changed into a black uniform with stripes and buttons. His shorts became long pants as Jake grew from 5 feet tall to a young adult who was over 6 foot 6 inches tall in a matter of seconds!<br />
<br />
“Wow…” Jake said, in a deep, baritone voice. “I’m a grownup now…”<br />
<br />
“Yes… and you’re a cop… You know everything there is to know about being a police officer…” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
Another officer peered through the door and stared at Jake.<br />
<br />
“Officer McLeod! We need you in section 6 unit 17!”<br />
<br />
“Coming right now!” Jake said, before he turned towards Ty. <br />
<br />
“Thank you!!” Jake said, as he saw his notebook and pencil transform into his cap and gun. He picked up his gear and put the gun in its holster and placed the cap on his head before walking out the door. Ty finally had the room to himself.<br />
<br />
Now that Ty had the break room to himself, he decided to direct his powers towards Frank. He decided to make Frank become really thirsty, and to give him a craving for a nice, hot cup of coffee, just as he was talking to Dustin.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, Mr. Hansen…” Frank said, as he got up from his chair and walked towards the restroom down the hall. He used the restroom and washed his hands, and then he walked into the break room. Even though Ty was sitting on one of the chairs in the break room, he made it so that Frank didn’t even notice Ty sitting there.<br />
<br />
As Frank walked in the break room, he walked up to the coffee bar and grabbed an empty, plastic cup. While holding the cup with his right hand, he began to feel an odd, tingling feeling throughout his entire body.<br />
<br />
While Frank looked on, he noticed something strange about his hand. His fingers began to shrink! His hand became smaller as his fingers shrunk down. His nails grew longer and sharper while his fingers shrunk down further, making it almost impossible for him to hold on to the cup. He dropped the cup on the floor, as he looked on and stared at his hands in shock. He realized that his smaller, thinner hands now resembled paws!<br />
<br />
“Hey! What the… I’m changing!” Frank stuttered. “I… I’m changing into a d-d-dogawhoo..awhooo… whooaoaowoo… roooraaahh…”<br />
<br />
Frank realized that a thin coat of hair began forming all over his body as his body began to shrink rapidly while his face began to change all at the same time. His mouth started pushing outward and morphed into a muzzle while he tried to speak, and he was only able to blurt out barking sounds and short howls.<br />
<br />
Frank’s noise stretched out even further as his power of smell became more enhanced. Light brown hair covered his entire face, as a thin coat of fur crept up all over his body. His ears stretched out and became pointy on top, while his eyes changed color and became light brown. As his muzzle grew longer, new teeth popped up in his mouth, and his tongue became longer. The hair around his long nose became black, while the hair around the rest of his face became light brown. The hair around his eyes became black as well as his head shrunk a bit until his head no longer resembled that of a human being, but that of a dog.<br />
<br />
Then, his entire body began to shrink rapidly. His upper body and his legs shrunk quickly, becoming shorter, thinner and smaller. His legs could no longer support his entire body as the toes on his feet shrunk and became paws as well. He finally dropped down and was standing on all fours, as his body was now half the size it was before. <br />
<br />
A stubble began to form on the back of his rear and a flock of hair began to push out, growing longer and thicker. It continued to grow out further and further, forming a thick, bushy tail, which matched the same light brown color of the rest of the dog’s coat. <br />
<br />
The dog’s legs were completely light brown, while the torso had a large black spot on top of its back. Lastly, the hairs at the end of the dog’s tail were of the lightest brown color. <br />
<br />
“Woof! Woooof!” the German shepherd barked, as it shook the black uniform off of it, leaving the police gear on the floor as the canine walked towards Ty.<br />
<br />
 “Come here! Good boy!” Ty chuckled, as he petted the dog by rubbing his palm of his hand over the dog’s head. Ty had finally transformed Frank into a German shepherd!<br />
<br />
“I wish nobody would remember anything about Frank, the police officer…” Ty said out loud. “Instead, everybody would know Franky, the police dog…”<br />
<br />
Then Ty turned towards Frank’s utility belt, his gun, and his uniform, which lay on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I need to get rid of the evidence…” Ty sighed. “I need a dog treat for Franky…”<br />
<br />
The gun, the belt and the uniform suddenly molded together and magically transformed into a large dog bone for the dog to chew on!<br />
<br />
Ty then opened the door to the break room, and Franky’s partner had just walked past the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey! There he is! Franky! Here boy!” the officer shouted.<br />
<br />
Franky then grabbed the big dog bone and held it between his teeth, before walking up to the police officer. Ty just smiled, as the officer walked off with the dog strolling next to him. Ty knew that Frank, the police officer, would never appear in court. Dustin was free to go!<br />
<br />
Dustin was wandering around the police station when he saw Ty coming out of the break room.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty! Some officer with a dog just came up to me and told me I could go home…” Dustin cheered. “And I don’t have to pay anything!”<br />
<br />
“Great, Dustin! Let’s get outta here!” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
The two boys walked out of the station and as soon as they were standing on the parking lot, Ty had teleported them back to the spot where Dustin had parked his SUV, which was at the location where they had been pulled over by Frank earlier that day.<br />
<br />
“I guess I’d better renew the tag on my license plate, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! You’d better take care of that tomorrow!” Ty suggested, as the boys got in the car.<br />
<br />
Dustin started the car and then the boys drove off, so they could finally drive home after a long day…</p>
