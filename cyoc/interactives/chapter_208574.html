<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Jeff can decide however, he hears his mother calling for him, “JEFF,” Jane calls, “GET YOUR LAZY TEENAGER BUTT DOWN HERE! YOU STILL HAVE CHORES TO DO!”<br />
<br />
Jeff grumbles, ‘every time I am busy,’ the 16-year-old thinks to himself, ‘that woman is soooooo annoying.’ He then shouts back, “COMING… MOM,” he then gets up from his chair, not bothering to shut down his computer, or at least close the program, ‘I’ll be back in a few minutes anyway,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Just as Jeff is walking… stomping, down the stairs, he does not notice the door to his 10-year-old sister Annabelle, or Anna for short, room open and his sister stepping out into the hall.<br />
<br />
Annabelle is wearing a witch’s costume, which she plans on wearing on Halloween the next day. The costume is made up of a black, tight-fitting dress, which shows off her already noticeable feminine curves, and a typical pointy hat on her head. Jeff’s sister, despite her young age, is somehow further in development than most girls her age. The 10-year-old has a perfect hourglass figure, her butt is big, firm and round and her hips are wide. She is also a head taller than most girls her age, she also has BB-cup breasts. In other words: the 10-year-old looks more like a 16-year-old, so you can imagine the look on male teenagers faces when they ask her how old she is, or when she lets them know of her age when they start to become “flirty” with her. Annabelle heads towards Jeff’s room, “I hope Jeff won’t mind if I borrow a black pen to write my Halloween-sign,” she says to herself.<br />
<br />
The girl notices the door to her brother’s room is open, and she hears her brother arguing with their mother, the young girl rolls her eyes, “they really are always fighting,” she mumbles when she enters Jeff’s room, “they really should stop the crap.” Annabelle walks straight to Jeff’s desk and starts looking around for a thick black pen, opening draws and rummaging around on the desk, which is piled full of papers and other stuff.<br />
<br />
Not finding any pen, Annabelle lets out a sigh, “would have been a surprise if he actually would have one,” she mumbles to herself. The girl is about to leave, when a ping from Jeff’s Laptop catches her attention. Annabelle looks at the screen and sees a message, “please choose a transformation, or scan a new target, now,” she reads out loud, “hu? What is this? Did Jeff get himself a new game?”<br />
<br />
Annabelle tilts her head, her curiosity already getting the best of her, she listens and notices that Jeff and her mother are still arguing, “knowing them, it’ll take at least another hour or two until they calm down,” she says, “so, it won’t hurt to check this game out, Jeff won’t notice.” So, the girl sits herself on Jeff’s chair, “okay, better do a new scan, I don’t want to change Jeff’s savings,” she says to herself, “besides, he’d notice it.” Annabelle then clicks on the “Scan new target” button, and a new message pops up, “please move away from the Laptop, until the red blinking bar turns to a solid green.” Annabelle shrugs and does as told, “what a weird game,” she says, as she moves away from the Laptop. Once the girl reaches the middle of Jeff’s room the red blinking bar turns to a solid green bar, “please stay still while the program scans you,” the girl reads. Suddenly a red beam of light shoots out from the built-in camera, causing Anna to let out a surprised yelp, but she manages to stay putt. She watches as the beam travels up and down her body and back up, then the beam vanishes and Anna sees a new message, “scan successful.”<br />
<br />
The girl walks back to the desk and sits back down, “please press “continue” to get to the transformation folder screen,” which the girl does. Here eyes widen at all the folders displayed, there is a folder labeled “Animal”, a Folder labeled “Inanimate”, a folder labeled “Animal Body Parts” and many more. The girl scrolls through the folders, “wow, so many folders,” she says, “I guess it is some kind of new 3D simulator game. Pretty cool actually that the game is able to create a 3D model of the person scanned.” The girl continues to scroll through the folders, “I guess these folders are there to help the player design his or her character,” she mumbles to herself. As she continues to scroll through the folders, one catches her eye, “there is a Halloween folder,” she asks herself, “hmmm… sounds interesting,” with that she opens the folder and is greeted by new folders.<br />
<br />
The new folders are labeled “mystical creatures”, “anthros” and one labeled “witches and wizards”, this last one catches her attention. “I think I’ll play a witch,” Anna says with a smile, she always loved witches, thought they were cool, even the evil ones, “hehe… would be cool if I were a witch and could do magic. THAT would be so much fun!”<br />
<br />
Annabelle opens the folder and selects “witch”, a pop up message asks her if she would like to have magic powers, the girl clicks the “yes” button. The next message asks her if she’d like to have the knowledge of magic words and phrases, the power to use magic with her thoughts, for example if she’d want to transform someone into an animal, that she just has to think of that animal and the person will transform. Annabelle thinks for a while, she then decides it would be far more fun if the “victims” would be unaware of her transforming them, “if I’d say a spell out loud, the person would notice it was me, having him or her be unaware the look of confusion and surprise on their faces will be priceless.” A new message pops up, asking Anna what kind of powers she would want to have, listing some possible powers below the question. Annabelle thinks for a while, &quot;hmm... hypnosis could come in handy,&quot; she mutters, &quot;I could hypnotize enemy CPUs and have them fight for me,&quot; so she ticks the box next to &quot;hypnosis&quot;. The girl also ticks the boxes next to &quot;Transformation&quot;, &quot;Curse&quot;, &quot;Body Swap&quot;, &quot;Soul Excahnge&quot; and &quot;Soul creation&quot;, the last one would give Anna the ability to create a soul and have is merged to a costume. The girl giggles, &quot;just imagine,&quot; she says, &quot;some CPU is wearing a dog costume, cat costume or any other animal. Once the soul I created has fused with the costume, the costume would control the wearers body.&quot; After selecting this option, a new message asks the girl if she’d like the transformation of the person to be instant or slow, Anna decides to have her magic have a slow effect on the person, “I want to enjoy watching the computer character slowly transforming into some kind of animal,” the girl says, still thinking that this is just some weird computer game. The next message which pops up asks her if she’d want to be immortal, Anna clicks on “no”, the next message asks if she’d want to age or stay her current age for ever, Anna selects to permanently stay 10, “I wish it were real,” she mumbles, “I don’t wanna grow old.” The next message then asks the girl if she wants to have her powers to be limited or unlimited, the girl decides to go with “unlimited”, “it would be a pain if I’d have to wait a while until I am able to use my magic again,” Anna mutters, “what if I get attacked?” Finally the last message appears, “if you are satisfied with your change, please click “confirm” below,” which she does.<br />
<br />
After confirming the settings, Anna suddenly starts to feel weird, a tingling sensation starts to spread through her body, causing the girl to shiver, “th-that felt weird,” she says. She turns back to the screen, she sees that a new message has appeared, “change to target successful,” Annabelle reads, “hu? What about the game? When will it start,” she asks herself. The girl then suddenly feels something else, some sort of energy starts to grow inside of her, the young girl starts to feel more and more powerful, the girl’s eyes widen when she finally realizes what is going on. “N-no way,” she breaths, “no way is this possible! There is NO WAY that I have become a witch,” she looks around the room, “only one way to find out.”<br />
<br />
Annabelle sees a sock lying on Jeff’s floor, she points a finger at the dirty clothing and, with her mind, wills it to float. As the girl imagines the sock lifting off of the ground and floating in the air, her eyes widen when she sees the sock do exactly that. Annabelle lets the sock fall back to the ground, the young girl is shocked, “no… way…,” she whispers. She turns back to the program, which changed back to the main screen, showing two files, one with her name underneath it and one which is labeled “Jeff”. As a last test, to be absolutely sure this is not a dream, Anna wills her folder to disappear, the girl grins when she watches the folder with her name slowly fade and then completely vanish. Annabelle’s grin soon turns to an evil smirk, “oooooh…. I am gonna have soooooo much fun! And with this power I can help sooooo many people,” she says, rubbing her hands, “but, before I can really start testing my new found gift, I need a black kitty, like any other witch. Hmm… now, who or what should I transform into my black kitty?”</p>
