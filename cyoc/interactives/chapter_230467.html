<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claudia groaned as she entered her home with her children. She was still in a haze of pain. Mika had died only three days ago and finalizing the wake and funeral was proving to be overwhelming. If her father in law and mother hadn&#39;t been there, the petite young woman felt she would have lost her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Head upstairs and get ready for bed. I&#39;ll be up soon.&quot; Kari, her eldest daughter, nodded, taking the hands of her twin siblings. Claudia was amazed at how responsible the barely 5 year old was. Yes she was heartbroken at the loss of her mother but she seemed to realize her siblings and mother needed her. Claudia couldn&#39;t be prouder of the young kitsune, especially considering how traumatized Aaron was.<br />
<br />
Claudia feared for her young son. During the attack, the young kintaro boy had snuck away from the safety of his room.  Mika, in a last act of parental love, had enchanted a room to keep her and Kellies children safe. Aaron though, was an adventurous boy and always wanted to help. It was what made the boy run to help to Connor Moreland last year, making him a demon hunting apprentice. Unfortunately though, his bravery had led him to witness the murder of his mother right before his eyes. Since then, Aaron had become withdrawn, barely saying a word to anyone, even his sisters. Aaron had just turned four and Claudia now feared how this event would shape the boys life going forward.<br />
<br />
Alone for the first time all day, Claudia could finally let her emotions overflow. Hot tears now ran down her cheek, the petite woman silently crying. Even though her siblings were willing to help her, she had no idea how she could go on. A sound now drew the womans attention, Claudia spinning around as a fireball now formed in her hand. Scowling at the shadows, she watched as a figure now slowly emerged. &quot;What are you doing here,&quot; she snarled.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now took a step forward, Claudia&#39;s fireball barely illuminating the kitsunes form as his tails wished behind him. &quot;I came to offer my condolences,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Mika was my sister afterall.&quot; Claudia scoffed, the womans eyes narrowing as she glared at the imposing kitsune. &quot;You never gave a shit about her before,&quot; she spat. &quot;Why would you care now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are correct,&quot; Fukushu replied, his voice low as he returned Claudia&#39;s gaze. &quot;In life, I did not show Mika the respect she deserved. I let my own emotions get in the way. I was wrong for that, which is why I am here now.&quot; Claudia said nothing, still focused on Fukushu. After everything that happened, the last thing she wanted to do was fight. Worse, she had fought Fukushu in the past. She was well aware of how strong he was, even at her best she stood little chance. For the sake of her children, she would need to remain calm. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To help,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;I know who killed Mika. I fear she will return.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can handle that,&quot; Claudia grumbled. Fukushu though wasn&#39;t so sure she could. Despite his brief history with Claudia, he was concerned about her families well being. &quot;I am not so sure,&quot; he replied. Claudia said nothing, a silence lingering between the pair before Fukushu said something that almost made her lose her composure. &quot;What about your son Aaron?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep his name out of your mouth,&quot; Claudia growled, her eyes glinting with rage. &quot;I only bring him up because I am concerned,&quot; Fukushu said softly. &quot;After what the boy has seen, he will be haunted by that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron will be fine,&quot; Claudia countered. Fukushu simply narrowed his eyes, staring at the woman he had considered an adversary for sometime. &quot;I wasn&#39;t,&quot; he said. Claudia was confused, what did he mean by that? Fukushu sighed, now speaking of something he so rarely spoke of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like your son I too have seen someone take a loved one from me,&quot; he said. &quot;I know what it is like. To witness death and feel so helpless as it happened. It is a wound from which you can not heal. A rot that fills you with vengeance. Eventually that vengeance becomes all consuming. All I wish is for your son to not be consumed by the the same vengeance that has been the driving force in my centuries of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia was speechless, her eyes focused on the fearsome nine tail. Looking at his vulpine face, she could now see regret etched on his face. &quot;I&#39;ve come to offer you peace Claudia Harris,&quot; he continued. &quot;As long as I draw breath, your children will be safe. They.....they are family and I shall protect them as such. Perhaps one day, you will trust me enough to help your son. The boy deserves a better life than I had.&quot; Without another word, Fukushu now stepped back into the shadows, vanishing from her home. Claudia now stared into the shadows, wondering if what happened was real. An old enemy would protect her children and was willing to guide her son into not becoming the monster he himself had become.<br />
<br />
****************************<br />
<br />
Duke sighed, admiring the blood red moon in the sky. As much as he hated vampires, he had to admit their was beauty here. &quot;You look like you&#39;re deep in thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke turned, a soft smile on his face as Sasha now approached. The last few days were a whirlwind. After rescuing Wyatts family, the wizard and dhamphir returned to the mortal realm only to discover things in chaos. The Normal had used the vampire realm as a distraction, attacking several targets including their friends. Now, with everyone trying to regroup, Duke and Sasha found themselves helping to maintain the tenuous peace that existed under his brother Wyatts rule. &quot;Just thinking about everything,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Nat called. She asked if we could go to Chenoa&#39;s parents funeral.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we could,&quot; Sasha replied before sighing. &quot;Looks like we&#39;re going to alot of funerals this week. Naomi says Mikas funeral is in two days.&quot; Duke nodded, a sad expression on his face as he thought of Mika Harris and Chenoa&#39;s parents. For Mika, she was a casualty of the war yet the fact she was leaving behind three young children was heartbreaking. Chenoas parents were even worse. They were innocent in all this, sacrificing their lives to save their daughter. The Normal targeted Chenoa for her magic, stealing it and nearly ending the Deer Girls life. To save her, Chenoa&#39;s parents sacrificed their own lives and magic to give their daughter a second chance. Still, their was one more that Duke worried about. &quot;Any news on Calebs dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still missing,&quot; Sasha said sadly. &quot;And it&#39;s been almost a week. Mrs. Moreland and the kids are okay thankfully but no one can find Mr. Moreland.&quot; Duke nodded, realizing that with each passing hour the likelihood of Jacob Moreland being okay decreased. &quot;Did you talk with Caleb?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Sasha said sadly. &quot;Were you able to talk with him?&quot; Duke shook his head no. Ever since his father went missing Caleb Moreland had gone quiet. He wasn&#39;t returning texts or calls. Even Gloria was having a hard time talking with her boyfriend. Caleb was taking it hard, blaming himself for being away at school. All anyone could hope for was that he would be okay. &quot;I did talk with Wyatt though,&quot; Sasha said. &quot;He actually thanked me for staying here to protect his family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He thanked me earlier too,&quot; Duke grinned. &quot;Probably because Hanako was giving him the evil eye.&quot; Sasha chuckled, squeezing Dukes arm as she stated off into the night. &quot;In all seriousness though I think he may actually have turned a corner,&quot; Duke continued. &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be exchanging Christmas gifts but, he seems to have a begrudging respect for me protecting his children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we doing the right thing Duke?&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke paused, he understood what Sasha was saying. With the Normal attacking their friends, the young couple wanted to be on the front lines. They wanted to stop the Normal just as badly as everyone else. Still, things remained unsettled within the vampire realm. Duke understood better than anyone how cruel vampires could be. He needed to keep Wyatts innocent children safe and to make sure the vampires didn&#39;t go after his friends. &quot;I think so Sasha,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****************************<br />
<br />
Standing outside her apartment, Gloria sighed heavily. It had been a long, emotionally draining day for the young woman. <br />
<br />
Returning home after hearing of the attack, Gloria discovered her sister in law and firmer babysitter Kellie Carlson was in the hospital. Kellie was lucky in the attack, a concussion and several staples to close a head wound. She would be leaving the hospital in a day or two. Mika Harris though wasn&#39;t as lucky. <br />
<br />
Despite Julia Harris-Morelands best efforts, Mika died on the operating table. Gloria&#39;s sister Katie and Naomi Tozawa were devastated. Katie had lost her life and Naomi had lost her sister. Both sobbed when hearing the news with Mikas twin brother Shiro trying to comfort the pair. For Gloria, she felt Mikas loss would reverberate for years to come.<br />
<br />
Things didn&#39;t get any easier when they discovered what happened to the Moreland family. Spark and Connor were away at the time, learning of the attack afterwards. Both teens were devastated, their pain partially relieved when they discovered Nina and the twins were okay. Still, with Jacob missing and Daphne destroyed the family found themselves in mourning. The only conciliation they had was the fact S.P.E.A.R would help rebuild the home. Caleb though didn&#39;t make the trip with Gloria.<br />
<br />
After hearing of the attack on his family, Caleb made sure they were okay before returning to school. He would find the would be assassins and deal his own brand of justice. Since that initial visit though, Caleb remained distant. As Gloria now entered their shared apartment, she paused as a noise echoed through their small apartment.<br />
<br />
Caleb could be heard grunting, the sound of something breaking coming from the side room Caleb used as a workout space. Slowly approaching, the coed now pushed the door open, her eyes wide as she beheld her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Caleb was striking a thick wooden board. Gloria had seen this board before, Caleb used it for practice when it came to striking. Now though, it appeared the young hunter was working through his own pain and frustrations. The young man&#39;s hands were bloody, a stain of blood firmly matted into the boards.  &quot;Caleb,&quot; she said softly.<br />
<br />
Caleb said nothing, grunting in anger as he continued to strike the board harder. It appeared he had been doing this for hours, his knuckles split open and covering the board and his hands with blood. &quot;Caleb,&quot; she said more forcefully. &quot;Caleb stop! STOP!&quot;<br />
<br />
The young hunter wouldn&#39;t respond, so focused on his attack as his knuckles continued to bleed. Quickly the young wizard ran to him, yelling for him to stop before grabbing his hands. &quot;Stop Caleb just stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Grasping the hunter by the shoulder, she turned him towards her. Calebs face was filled with rage, yet as he looked at her something within him broke. Tears now streamed down his face as he angrily stared at his girlfriend. &quot;Stop Caleb,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Just stop please. You don&#39;t have to be a hunter tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb said nothing, simply grabbing his girlfriends hands as he sank to his knees. A small cry escaping his lips as his girlfriend comforted him. &quot;You don&#39;t have to be a hunter tonight,&quot; she said softly, squeezing him tightly. &quot;Just let yourself go. Just for tonight. I promise I&#39;ll keep you together.&quot;</p>
