<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lunn O’Donnelly was a man that, despite the stereotype of the jolly Irishman, had a strong bitter side to him. He was by no means nasty, but get him talking and he would some way or another end up at the conclusion that the glass was half empty, and the world was half fucked. As often as he was disappointed in the world, he was ashamed of himself. It was why he enjoyed time spent with his mates at the bar. For a short few hours he could spend some quality time with liquid bravery chatting, cracking jokes, and trying to pick up chicks. <br />
<br />
As the New Year encroached he had heard more and more about these animal people. He had even seen a few. Strange stuff, yet he couldn’t get his mind off of it. At first he dismissed it as the insane march of transhumanism, but as 2020 approached the idea of reinventing himself came to mind, and snuggled up with the thought of animalia. At first he was just entertaining it, then imagining it, then anticipating it. So one day he convinced himself to head down to the bar, look at pictures of converts over a drink, and pick an animal. <br />
<br />
He started with lizards and snakes, but their striking, cold features weren’t what he wanted from his new life. He tried dogs but was unimpressed. Then he moved onto cats, or rather one specific cat. He had come to the bar on a day he usually stayed home and read, so now he had been seeing all sorts of staff he hadn’t met before. Behind the granite bar was a spotted little lass in a black V-neck, a tail swaying slowly behind her. <br />
<br />
“Can I get ye anything boyo?” The jaguar asked.<br />
<br />
“Aye. Glass o’ scotch.” He replied. “And uh… mind answerin’ a wee question?” <br />
<br />
“Ask away.” She said pouring the drink. <br />
<br />
“Well, do humans ever seem tasty?” He joked. He thought it was stupid, but tried it anyway.<br />
<br />
She rolled her eyes with a smile, placed the glass on the bar, and leaned forward. The way her furred arms rested on the bar and her chest rested above the granite gave Lunn a view of her cleavage. “Only the ones that nae tip.” She bared her teeth jokingly.<br />
<br />
“I’m in luck then bloody hell, just killed me cheap uncle. Got his parts in the car if you’re hungry!”<br />
<br />
The jaguar girl laughed. <br />
<br />
“Second question if you’re up for it.” Lunn warned.<br />
<br />
“Aye.” <br />
<br />
“When you gettin’ out?”<br />
<br />
She smiled, wrote something down on a piece of paper, and tended to the other customers.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the next month, the jaguar named Tawnee was eager to give Lunn a good time. The day he had always spent alone became another bar day. Tawnee started to invite Lunn to parties, some of which were filled with animalians. He was still somewhat unsure about making the leap, so he always took care to avoid getting infected. One day he had come early to the bar. It gave him and Tawnee a nice bit of time to talk alone with some quality drinks. She asked a question Lunn had anticipated for a while now.<br />
<br />
“So fella, ye ever think about converting?” Tawnee asked.<br />
<br />
“Aye, sometimes.” He replied.<br />
<br />
“And what are your thoughts about it?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno. It would be nice though to have a fresh start though.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, it really is. How about becoming a jaguar?”<br />
<br />
“Well they are bloody gorgeous.”<br />
<br />
Tawnee blushed, and leaned forward to give a nice view of her cleavage. “You see those people becoming shemales. Crazy what it can do nowadays nae?”<br />
<br />
Lunn suddenly felt flustered. It was something he had often had fantasies about. “You know… I’ve thought about that sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” She said chuckling. <br />
<br />
“Aye.” Lunn stammered. “It does sound kinda… enticing.”<br />
<br />
“Aww. Ye should do it then. Ye’d look cute.”<br />
<br />
“You really think so? I dunno. Seems kinda…”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Tawnee interjected. “Everyone who does it seems really happy.”<br />
<br />
Lunn paused. “Well… is that all there is to life?” He questioned.<br />
<br />
“Is what?”<br />
<br />
“Happiness, pleasure?”<br />
<br />
“Lunn,” she stated, sighing. “All that philosophy stuff just holds ye down, ye only live once, let go.”<br />
<br />
Lunn looked down unsure, but conceited. <br />
<br />
The next few days had Lunn readying the paperwork for animalia, and change into a more feminine identity. His original idea was to change his name to “Lynn,” but Tawnee suggested instead “Luna.” If he wanted to reinvent himself, why not go for something more fantastic? The efficiency of animalia had a herm virus sent in the mail within only a week. He carefully placed it into his car when he knew Tawnee would be closing alone. The bar lacked security cameras, and there was both an excitement and romance in doing this in both the place they first met, and somewhere that was usually so public. <br />
<br />
Lunn joined Tawnee behind the bar. He watched, growing hard, as Tawnee lifted up her V-neck and bra, exposing one of her soft and furry breasts. She moaned as she milked herself. A part of Lunn was excited at the idea of having his own milk. It was a major part of his fantasies. When Tawnee handed over the milk, he mixed in the herm virus. He stared into the white liquid once it was stirred. <br />
<br />
“There’s no going back after this…” He muttered.<br />
<br />
“You’ll look so sexy Lunn, don’t worry, accept yourself.” Tawnee encouraged.<br />
<br />
He didn’t say anymore, and just swigged his girlfriends sweet jaguar milk. Immediately a warm feeling followed where the milk travelled through his throat. “Ohhh…” he moaned. Tawnee pulled his shirt over his head and stared into his eyes as she unbuttoned his pants. Lunn looked to his shoulder, and felt the growing fur between his fingers. He let his hands slide down his chest to where a pressure was building up. His pecs were getting softer, fat and mammary tissue building up. He kneaded then as they grew. “Tawnee…” he moaned in an increasingly feminine voice.<br />
<br />
“Luna…” she replied. She could smell his arousal, and it was kicking her into overdrive. She was in season, and her bisexuality found the idea of getting knocked up by a woman’s penis to be incredibly exciting. <br />
<br />
Lunn was painfully erect. His changing foreskin waa becoming a furred sheath. He kept waiting for something else to be there, but despite the growing breasts nothing was coming down below. “Tawnee,” he moaned again, even more high pitched, “please…”<br />
<br />
“Luna…” she repeated, sliding her pants down. She pulled her effeminizing lover close, gently stroking their dick. Then she bent over and presented herself to be mated. Her tail cocked to show her needy pussy, she yowled. <br />
<br />
Lunn got on all fours as well, feeling new paw pads form against the hardwood. He placed two hands on Tawnee’s shoulders, probing against her needy hole. <br />
<br />
“Luna…” she repeated.<br />
<br />
Shi started thrusting as a tail started snaking from her growing ass. Luna’s face was becoming both more soft and more feline at the same time. Shi was graced with whiskers, a pink flat nose green feline eyes, and a pair of triangular ears atop hir head. Hir tail swayed with Luna’s sexy hips and waist as the new appendage struggled to free itself. Luna yowled as shi thrusted her dick again and again into her mate below her. Tawnee regressed, only able to focus on mating and cubs. She wanted to be a true jaguar, to breed and hunt. Luna could feel her breasts started to leak. Shi still didn’t have a vagina, but shi could already feel her second dose coming. Hir breasts were growing, hir dick was bigger, shi had the muscles of a predator. The stream of milk matted both Luna and Tawnee’s fur. “Tawnee…” shi moaned. Tawnee only yowled. Luna’s cock finally released, spraying streams of cum into hir mate as the two pant. Luna’s orgasm however kept going for longer than she thought. Waves of pleasure rocked over hir as shi experienced hir first estrogen fueled orgasm.<br />
<br />
Cum continued pouring into Tawnee as Luna laid on hir back, Tawnee sprawled out on top. She maneuvered her head, and gently sucked milk from Luna’s breasts. <br />
<br />
Luna looked over hir body as pleasure rocked it. It was incredibly sexy, but somehow she hadn’t been given a pussy. Hir orgasm told hir she was full of estrogen despite hir functioning balls, but how was that possible without ovaries?<br />
<br />
She wiped the thought away and focused on the weight and pleasure of hir girlfriend resting her head on hir breast, gently nursing. Eventually the two disinfected the whole bar, got dressed and headed to their respective homes. Luna spent the night enjoying hir new body until she ran dry, and then laid awake confused. <br />
<br />
Hir being a great big oddity demanded testing both psychological and physical. The biological tests came back with a few theories about mixing the herm virus with the virus from a non-herm convert. The mixture created a new virus that effectively caused Luna’s male reproductive system to switch over to using and producing female hormones. Psychological tests on the other hand brought results that passed well enough for the animalian council. A bit of nerves after a large change isn’t uncommon. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately Luna never ended up fitting in with the herm community. Shi had tried, but her girlfriend being a female and her not being a full herm left too much separation. In hir introduction to animalia, a tour guide was bringing the uplifted and converts around the city in the hopes of new people. During which, a small fragment of a past life let slip from hir lips.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t it wonderful here?” The tour guide asked. <br />
<br />
“Everyone seems so happy.” One of the fresh converts mentioned. “There’s like… no crime either.”<br />
<br />
“O, brave new world, that has such people in it.” Shi muttered. <br />
<br />
A lion by the name of Micheal laughed a deep throaty chuckle before asking, “You’re a fan of The Tempest then?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” shi lied nervously. Luna had never read Shakespeare. <br />
<br />
Lunn had read Alduos Huxley.</p>
