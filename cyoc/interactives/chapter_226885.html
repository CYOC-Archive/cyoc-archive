<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle felt a little bad for what he did to Greg, but he was more turned on by it. He walked home and found himself getting more horny than usual. Unknown to Kyle, SMS and the affects thereof were being controlled by the curse, and it&#39;s gaze was pointed directly at him, karma is a bitch after all. Arriving home, Kyle made a straight line for the fridge, his weekend activities would have to wait until his ravenous hunger was satiated, he had been putting on some weight, mostly because of the increased amount of flesh he needed to fuel, but also because SMS was gearing up for something big in his future. <br />
<br />
The curse had been changing reality, making SMS a genetic disease, which arrived in two phases, the first in early puberty, and the second a few years after the first changes. Most would just advance by growing a few more genitalia, others gained more limbs, some weren&#39;t so lucky, finding their original transformation drastically altered overnight. And even rarer was and extra effect that no one could track, making everyone who viewed the victim believe they were always the way they appeared, as if they were born that way, and since the symptom was psychically propelled, no one believed the victims  please, constantly making excuses for the victim&#39;s plight.<br />
<br />
Kyle finished off a whole large pizza, and a full bottle of soda, they made his way back to his bedroom. Kyle&#39;s Friday nights for the past three months were spent streaming his sexual escapades for cash, he made a pretty penny each stream, and found a way to help his single mother, she didn&#39;t approve of his activities at first, but then she saw the checks and begrudgingly dropped her arguments, on the condition that he hide his face while doing it. He had set up a few cameras that he could power on, but were inconspicuous to the naked eye, so that he didn&#39;t have to take them down when he was done. His mother worked late shift, not getting home until two in the morning today, which made it perfect for Kyle&#39;s plans. He stripped his clothes, getting naked and went to his closet, pulling out a helmet from a box hidden in the back. The helmet was a motorcycle helmet, painted yellow, with cat ears, what was special about it though was that it had a voice modulator built into it, letting Kyle talk without being muffled in the helmet, and identified for his voice. <br />
<br />
Starting up his stream he did his usual dances and sexual touching, but twenty minutes into the stream Kyle started talking to the audience in a high pitch voice.<br />
<br />
“Okay guys, I&#39;ve got a surprise for you, if we hit six hundred dollars tonight, I&#39;ll introduce you to the &#39;members of the board&#39;!” The chat lit up, members of the board? Was she about to do a four way, on a live stream? It took only three minutes for the viewers to hit six hundred, Kyle blushed heavily under the helmet, he was sure if he was ready, but they payed his fee, so he&#39;d give them what they wanted. “Oh you guys are too much! So you&#39;ve been begging for me to put something inside my four pussies, so may I introduce you to...” Kyle reached off camera and pulled up a home built sex toy, placing it on the bed with an audible thud. “The members of the board.” Kyle said this last part as sensually as possible, the chat froze and then went wild. <br />
<br />
The thing that Kyle had placed on the bed was a board, arranged to angle four large, bright pink dildos at all four of his pussies in one shot. He pulled the straps on the sides of the board through two handles fixed to the sides of his bed, to make sure that it didn&#39;t go anywhere, and he crawled onto the bed. “Okay, I&#39;ve never done this before, but you guys deserve it. Ready?” Kyle shivered with excitement, not having done penetration with all four of his pussies before. “Go.” He shoved his four sets of legs forward and plunged the dildos deep within, what followed for the next half hour of the stream was debauchery to say in the least, Kyle for his part hammed up his act as much as possible, even though he was enjoying it, he knew what these viewers wanted. <br />
<br />
After the half hour was up, Kyle lay there panting, all four of his lady legs visibly shuddering, weakly he said his sign off, and ended the stream, looking at the cash flow he went wide eyed, not only had he tripled his viewer count, but he raised a thousand dollars tonight. He sighed, not only did he enjoy that, it was definitely worth it. After a few minutes he cut power to his cameras, and shakily moved around cleaning up after himself, and cleaning the new feature for his streams. He went and took a long shower, enjoying the heat of the water, and cleaned himself thoroughly, afterwards, he sat lazily in the living room, enjoying some tv for a while until he found himself too tired to stay up and he went to bed. <br />
<br />
While Kyle slept he had a wild wet dream, where not one but four Mrs. Lorenzas made love to him, blissfully unaware of what was happening to him outside of that dream. His legs started to shift, turning a full 180 degrees to face him, but then more mass grew in, making it&#39;s way upward toward his head, it wouldn&#39;t be until morning that he would wake up to a new life and nightmare. <br />
<br />
Kyle yawned, and went to stretch as he usually did only to find his arms blocked by a lot of something, something flesh and warm, but at the same time he felt all of his arms stretch up. All of his arms. He felt warm, his chests pressed against his center body. Chests. Kyle registered the feeling of a whole lot of legs cluttered around him in bed, he registered the feeling of several new sensations of breasts pressed against him, he felt all of his arms hugging him naturally, and after a few minutes he realized what he was feeling and his eyes went wide. <br />
<br />
Panic set in as he struggled to get away from the new feelings, only to find not one but five torsos in his bed, he rolled over panting, feeling the breasts pressed against his back as he got up, feeling all four of his sets of legs standing, he knew something was off when he stood up, and felt the feet in different positions than they were last night. He scrambled over to the mirror and whimpered, there in the mirror was Kyle, hanging in the center of four complete from the neck down copies of Mrs. Lorenza&#39;s body, their chests pressed against him in a half circle, leaving his pale body hanging in the center of the four Latina bombshells that he now possessed. <br />
<br />
He panicked, using all eight of the new arms to try a push the bodies away from him only to find that their movements were different than what he wanted them to do, they groped him, messaging his balls and legs, each moved one hand against his will to message their now complete womanhoods as he helplessly squirmed against his forced orgy, he moaned weakly as he felt the waves of pleasure wash over him, the heat of the four goddesses pleasuring him rising they finally climaxed at the same time. He collapsed, a tangle of sexy bodies enclosing his skinny pale self, they gently messaged him, as if to reassure him it was going to be okay. He then realized that the bodies were acting on their own, and he started to struggle again, only to be met by a calm and gentle set of eight women soothing him until he calmed down. <br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t do this girls. I can&#39;t.” Kyle whimpered, all four of the bodies reached up a hand to gently touch his face and head. “Can... can we go to the kitchen please?” The bodies got up, coordinating perfectly as a squad, and walked themselves to the kitchen, avoiding all the obstacles in the hall, they reached the kitchen where his mother was. They stopped, and Kyle chocked back tears, “Mom?” He said as calmly as possible.<br />
<br />
“Yes honey?” She turned around, not even reacting to his changes.<br />
<br />
“Do.... do I look different today?” Kyle tried to wrap his head around what was going on. <br />
<br />
“No honey, your the same beautiful person you are everyday.”<br />
<br />
“But I didn&#39;t look like this yesterday!”<br />
<br />
“Of course you did silly.... oh.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Are you? Oh your disassociating again, honey...” His mom walked over to him and put her hands on his cheeks. “You&#39;ve always had five bodies. It&#39;s not your fault they look so much like hers, and she&#39;s alright with that. Mrs. Lorenza is our friend, she understands it wasn&#39;t SMS, it was a mere coincidence. Now, please, calm down and sit, breakfast is almost ready.” She turned and walked back over to the stove, leaving a stunned Kyle completely speechless, the quartet of bodies walked him over to a chair and sat his center body down in it, leaning over the back of the chair, arms folded as they got themselves comfortable in a standing position. Kyle was presented with a breakfast four times as big as usual, which he downed without a problem. <br />
<br />
After breakfast he quietly requested his bodies to walk him back to the bedroom and over to his computer desk. He turned on his computer and as it booted up the two rear bodies grabbed his arms and held them behind him. He squirmed, “What do you think your doing? I&#39;m in charge! Your my bodies!” The right most body took the mouse, and the left most put both hands on the keyboard, they navigated as Kyle helplessly watched as the female parts of him took control. They guided themselves to the streaming sight he had broadcast on and deleted his account, then emptying the paypal he was using for one last time and uninstalling the software for the cameras, all to his protests. They then opened the software that his voice modulator used, and began typing, when finished they addressed him through the computer.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Perkins, we may be connected to you, but now you are surrounded by four fully mature female bodies. What you did last night was very abusive of our parts, and since you are stuck with us now, we are in charge. We don&#39;t know how, or why we are independent, but we now control what we go through, not you.” <br />
<br />
“But, I....” Kyle started, but the left most started typing again.<br />
<br />
“After what you did to Greg, and after what you did last night, we think you need some help with self control, and we will decided what you do now. We would like for you to comply, but we don&#39;t need you to be voluntary!” Kyle stared at the screen and started to cry, not only had he changed this morning, but his mom didn&#39;t recognize it, and these new bodies were holding him captive. The two in the back reached around and hugged him, while the left one typed and the right one stroked his cheek. <br />
<br />
“Oh Kyle...” The voice said as sympathetically as it could. “We get it, four pair of legs, all sexy as hell, connected to little old you, what else could you have done, it was addicting wasn&#39;t it?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah... it was.” He whimpered. They typed again. <br />
<br />
“Your better than this Kyle, you can do better. We just want respect, after all, we&#39;re all copies of a woman that up until that curse was given to you, wasn&#39;t part of you to begin with. Now cheer up, you&#39;ve got four ladies, where a lot of guys don&#39;t even have one. Let&#39;s find out what happened and why our mom didn&#39;t realize it, Okay?”<br />
<br />
Kyle paused, feeling the gentle hands on him, knowing they were right, and finally calmed down.<br />
<br />
“Okay, can I at least use my hands?”  Four hands lifted themselves into view with a thumbs up, and Kyle began searching. What they found was a growing number of forum posts asking if anyone else changed and no one realized it, people mocking them for faking having SMS, and arguments that the medical community needed to take this more seriously because this many people couldn&#39;t be wrong. He then found a report that investigated several cases of people who swore up and down that they had changed, and how no one believed them, but the medical records still showed that all of the individuals had changed under SMS, with a theory that was starting to grow in credibility that maybe there was something to this.<br />
<br />
“I guess it&#39;s something to do with the change.” Kyle said.<br />
<br />
“You think it&#39;s a pheromone or something like that?” <br />
<br />
“No clue, it&#39;s probably the curse at work again. Either way, we&#39;re stuck like this, so... how can we make this seating arrangement more comfortable for you girls?”</p>
