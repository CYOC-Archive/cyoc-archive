<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you and Rachel make your way back through the vineyard, you feel invigorated and clear in your purpose.  You’re giddy with excitement about the new life and form that both of you will receive when you reach the communal hall.  Even more than that, you are ecstatic that Rachel will share this life with you.  You know you are going to be complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, slow poke,&quot; you tease Rachel.  &quot;I’ll race you there.&quot;  You break into a run, but Rachel is close on your heels.  You scramble down the small hill and reach the gate at the meadow outside the hall first but only by a few steps.  Both of you are winded by the short run, and Rachel falls into your arms gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;We’ll have to try THAT again later,&quot; she taunts you.  &quot;I bet I’ll be able to beat you when we can gallop!&quot;<br />
<br />
You kiss her passionately at the suggestion, and she returns the kiss with an equal ardor.<br />
<br />
Your revelry is broken by the door to hall opening.  It’s Lara and Michael, the centaur couple that you’ve seen around for the past days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are Themis and Ixion,&quot; Rachel begins, but she pauses, overcome by what she’s asking. &quot;Still inside?&quot; she finishes in a cracking voice.<br />
<br />
Michael smiles at her.  &quot;No, they’ve taken your friend Marina to the farrier to get shoed.  They’ll be back soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lara must recognize the sadness in Rachel’s eyes.  She trots over and takes Rachel's chin in her hand, raising her eyes to meet hers.  &quot;They’ll be time for you to join us, if that is what you wish.&quot; she says softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know!&quot; Rachel exclaims as she begins to blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call it a hunch,&quot; Lara admits, &quot;but you’ll be welcome as our sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We’re going for a run,&quot; Michael says, &quot;would you care to come along?&quot;  He lowers his front legs to offer you a mount.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks,&quot; you reply.  &quot;I think we’ll … wait for Themis and Ixion to return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Larry responds, &quot;we’ll see you soon.  Perhaps by then  you two'll be able to keep up with us.&quot;  Then he smiles broadly and takes Lara’s hand.<br />
<br />
With that the couple retreats to the meadow.  As they make it to the open field, they both take off at a blinding speed.  They reach the crest of the hill in a matter of seconds and stop to turn and wave at you.  Then they kiss and turn away, taking off once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Rachel urges.  &quot;They could be a while.  Let’s watch them run.&quot;<br />
<br />
She offers you her hand, and you walk with her to the top of the hill.  Michael and Lara are at the far end of the field now, well beyond the vineyard.  They race around trees and leap over streams, fences and hedges playing with one another.  Finally, they stop for a rest under the shade of a tree.  Rachel stands in front of you as you lean against a tree, and you drape your arms around her waist and watch the centaurs with a sense of awe and anticipation.  <br />
<br />
&quot;They look so happy together,&quot; Rachel sighs.<br />
<br />
You nuzzle her neck, and she giggles at your tickling.  &quot;Just like we'll be, my little filly,&quot; you tease.<br />
<br />
You notice Lara move away from Michael and place her hands on a fence rail.  She looks over her back at him and swishes her tail playfully in an obvious invitation.  Michael moves toward her and rears up on his hind legs as he approaches.  He lands on Lara’s back and his front legs drape over her torso.  He wraps his arms around his lover’s human torso and holds her in a manner much like you are now holding Rachel.  Your crotch swells with excitement and you worry that Rachel will think you’re some sort of a pervert.  You can't back up with the tree behind you and you don't want to push her away.  You hope she won't notice your arousal.<br />
<br />
Rachel turns her head around.  Her eyes are wide.  Then she pulls you into a to kiss just like the one Lara is planting on Michael. You feel her rock her hips into you at the same moment that Lara yelps with pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;We’d better give them some privacy,&quot; you whisper to Rachel.  She turns and kisses you hard on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she agrees.  &quot;Let’s see if Themis and Ixion are back.&quot;<br />
<br />
You get back to the hall, but it is still empty.  Rachel’s frustration is palpable.  &quot;Ugghhh,&quot; she grunts.  &quot;If we don’t get transformed soon, I think I’m going to explode!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hug her gently and brush her forehead to calm her.  &quot;I know how you feel,&quot; you admit.  &quot;But it’ll be okay.  Nothing’s going to stop us from being together … and from being complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel smiles at you and her green eyes light up with joy.  She rests her head on your shoulder and hugs you tight.  &quot;I love you, Ben,&quot; she whispers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Rach&quot; you answer.  A few days ago, you couldn't have imagined saying those words to anyone, even Rachel, but now they flow from your lips with an ease that comes from an understanding of how true they are.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anybody in here?&quot; someone calls from outside the door.  Your heart leaps with anticipation as sunlight floods the room from the open door, and you turn to look at who is calling you.  Then your heart sinks as you see the silhouette of three human figures standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we’re in her, Harry,&quot; you respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you in here?&quot; Deirdre asks as the three of them join you inside.  &quot;What's all this stuff for?&quot; she continues as she points at the magickal tomes and the remnants of the feast Marina enjoyed.<br />
<br />
You take a breath, unsure of how to inform your friends of your decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story,&quot; Rachel says.  She winks at you.  You can tell that she wants to keep your decision to become centaurs to yourselves for now    and you understand why - not because there is any shame in it but for fear that revealing your dream might keep it from coming true.<br />
<br />
&quot;We brought Marina here but…,&quot; you begin.<br />
<br />
From the quizzical looks on your friend’s faces, you can tell that their memory of her has been erased.  You shrug instead and mimic Rachel, saying, &quot;…long story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you find Krista?&quot; Rachel asks hopefully.  <br />
<br />
You glance at the receipt and see it is unchanged.  Only Marina’s name is absent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harry says, &quot;but we can’t get to her.  We came here looking for a long rope or a boat or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you need that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were walking along the shore to the south, where the cliffs are,&quot; Harry explains, &quot;and we saw her on the beach below.  She was running away from the weretigers when she fell down there.  The cliffs are too steep to climb up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the surf’s too rough to swim in or out,&quot; Felicia says.  &quot;The only way out is to be pulled up or sail out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she alright?&quot; Rachel asks as you look around the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;She seems to be,&quot; Deirdre says.   &quot;She looks a little beat up, scratched and bruised, but she’s moving around okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
You spy a rope on the opposite wall when you hear hoof steps at the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, guys,&quot; Marina says tentatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; Deirdre screams as she sees her old friend in her new form.  She runs over to her, &quot;What did you … why …. how?&quot;<br />
<br />
Themis and Ixion are at her side now, and Lara and Micheal enter behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m a centauress,&quot; Marina says proudly, &quot;and I’ve never been happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you look good,&quot; Harry says with a smile, &quot;I mean really good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Marina says as she blushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ixion,&quot; you interrupt, &quot;they’ve found our missing friend, but we can’t get to her.  Could we borrow that rope to pull her up the cliffs?&quot; you ask pointing a long rope hanging on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely,&quot; Ixion says.  He reaches over and hands the rope to you.  &quot;The cliffs are quite far for half-lings.  Would you like a ride?&quot; he asks.  Ixion looks at the centaurs in the room to see if they will join in the offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Rachel beams as she climbs up to mount Marina.   The rest of the humans and centaurs pair off – Deirdre is riding Themis, Harry on Lara and Felicia on Michael.  Ixion lowers his front legs, extends his hand to pull you up and trots with the others into the meadow.<br />
<br />
Rachel is a beauty framed by the afternoon sun.  You squint as you look at her and imagine her torso melded into a horse’s body like Marina’s.  She leans forward and whispers into her friend’s ear.  Marina smiles broadly and twists to hug Rachel.  Then she looks you up and down while nodding with approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, now,&quot; Themis urges, &quot;let us be off to rescue this friend of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Micheal lead the way with Lara close behind, Marina lingers for moment and says something to Themis.  She motions Ixion to her side.</p>
