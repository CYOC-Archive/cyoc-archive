<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the principal closed the call with the voice. She explained to the teacher, who she called as Miss Molly, to escort me with the juniors. We walked to a class room and in there I saw a lot of eyes just staring at me. Miss Molly explained who I was and that I would become a new student in the school with other juniors.<br />
<br />
I greeted everyone and got seated next to a guy who had a star wars pencil case and wore rimmed glasses. It seemed that everyone was more chill than what they seemed to be in movies. The first day at the 1983 high school didn&#39;t feel as awful as I had thought it would had been. I was even invited to eat with the stereotypical nerds who loved star wars. They actually were nice people I just wish there were atleast an one female nerd who I could talk with in the table.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt my body warming up and I saw a female approaching the table all of a sudden with a tray in her hands. She looked like the girl I saw in the bus but as she walked near the chair. Her face, clothes and body kept changing. No-one seemed to see or care about the changes as she got a little bit pudgier, had a greasier hair, suddenly grew braces, had a geeky red dragon pin in her shirt and gave a vibe of a nerd girl I&#39;ve seen in movies.<br />
<br />
As she greeted me she let out a nervous stutter and apologized for shouting at me.<br />
<br />
In my perspective I saw flashbacks of my mom changing from your typical sofa type mom into a mom who was really into nerd culture. She had card collection, super high tech computer, four huge bookshelves were she kept her figurines and roleplaying stuff safe, lots and lots of plushies from 80s and 90s, limited edition comicbooks and stuff I couldn&#39;t name. Her friends would talk about nerdy stuff and she would gain even more weight as she was more interested in all of her hobbies. She worked at nearby comic book store as a clerk and her friends called her &#39;Mother of all nerds&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what&#39;s wrong?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t hear your name...&quot; I asked back as the visions stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s- It&#39;s Susan and... what&#39;s our favorite comic book hero?&quot; She tried to ask maybe as an ice breaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... ummm... Spiderman I guess...?&quot; I replied to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve seen him on TV. He&#39;s cool I guess. Personally I&#39;m more into...&quot; Susan begun to ramble as she seemed to be only one at the table who was the nerdiest nerd. You could call her a supernerd compared to them.<br />
<br />
We talked a little bit and it seemed that our passion for superheros and nerd culture was mutual. Personally I felt that I was just parroting what my mom had told me when I was a kid rather than have my own opinions. She seemed to like my opinions and felt like that she wanted to hang out with more. Asking if could visit her after school this evening.<br />
<br />
I felt a very weird and odd feeling as my mother asked that. So I said yes without thinking. Maybe this was &#39;normal&#39; back then but I felt more relaxed as the school day ended quicker than what it did in 2000s. Or maybe the answers were just easier as my education was 17 years ahead of everybody else. Inside the school bus my mom had a reserved a seat next to me and the whole journey we kept talking about superheros and food. Then I saw some familiar places and finally saw where we were stopping at.<br />
<br />
It was my grandparents home. She told me that her parents, which are my grandparents, wouldn&#39;t be some until eight. That meant we could spend some time for three hours. She showed me her doodles she had made and her small cabinet where she kept her mint-condition figurine. Then as we sat on her bed she started to tease me. Playfully poking me and provoking me to do something.<br />
<br />
I knew what she trying to ask me but then I asked her as question: &quot;Ok. Tell me honestly. If you had a kid in future do you think you would be a good parent?&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused to think and slowly shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You noticed...?&quot; She said and looked elsewhere. &quot;Was I that desperate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noticed what...?&quot; I asked as I had no clue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake... I&#39;m....&quot; Susan let out a huge sigh as it was clearly hard to say something. &quot;I&#39;m already pregnant...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; I said as I let out a I-knew-but-I&#39;m-pretending-not-to-know gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you knew.&quot; Susan sighed again. &quot;Did David tell anyone how he accidentally slipped his penis inside my....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s David?&quot; I asked as it was first time hearing this name.<br />
<br />
My mother never spoke about my birth father as something had happened to him. Why did he leave her and why didn&#39;t my mother ever said his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know! Da-&quot; She stopped as she finally realized what I was truly wearing. &quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shoot, you just arrived to the school and I... I... I&#39;m the blabbermouth here just pouring my problems on to you, sorry. I forgot...&quot; She kept explaining. &quot;I don&#39;t know why I told you everything or why... I really don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
I could feel another headache coming where there were some slight changes happening in my past. I saw visions of...</p>
