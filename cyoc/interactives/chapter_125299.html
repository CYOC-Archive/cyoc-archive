<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Slaughter House Party was a place that had been well set up for more &quot;adult&quot; themed parties. And for Abby and Sarah, this would normally mean it would be something that they wouldn&#39;t have invited to before the outbreak. Abby&#39;s sixteenth birthday wasn&#39;t too far on the horizon, but both were still technically minors. On technicalities that sort of restriction could also be used for Malice and Travis as well, as before the outbreak they had at a stage in development for domestic dogs that had them as the equal to a human teenager, and thus considered minors. The only ones of the group that before the outbreak would be considered legal adults were Samson and Simon.<br />
<br />
However, the outbreak HAD occurred and in the process of Animalia&#39;s formation, Abby, Sarah, and Malice were all double dosed. Sarah then passed that condition on to Travis as the two of them had gotten to know each other at school during their Freshman year. The result of that had left them physically mature and healthy as any other adult Animalian, and since most double dosed Animalians had all taken mates or had the proverbial &quot;friend with benefits,&quot; the traditional age restrictions really didn&#39;t apply.  As such, their double dosed status did allow them entry into the part, as it wasn&#39;t as if they didn&#39;t know what their partner&#39;s looked like without clothes on already.<br />
<br />
The one thing that had some issues as they all changed into their costumes was the fact that the costumes, provided for the party by Ms. Vivian&#39;s shop were rather skimpy and some had the odd jokes that had come along with the tags. To some extent there was also some grumbling on the fact that they also played to certain stereotypes, but for the sake of good fun at the party, they&#39;d also gone alone with it. <br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s costume was essentially a variation on a &quot;naughty farm girl&quot; consisting on a pair of hot pants and a undersized plaid shirt that was designed to be tied in a knot in the middle. It exposed her midriff and showed a great deal of cleavage and some &quot;under-boob,&quot; but Abby was grateful that it did cover enough that she wasn&#39;t flashing the entirety of her breasts. She loved Samson and sex with him was wonderful, but that didn&#39;t entirely mean that she wanted to fully flaunt herself to every male in town. She&#39;d only gone along with it because of the fact that the Animalia Ambassadoria had already reached an agreement with Miss Vivian for it as a promotion for her shop.<br />
<br />
Samson was dressed in something more akin to a construction worker, which did break things up slightly from his role in helping to run the farm during the summer and after school, but many things were rather similar. The costume had him in tight pants that Abby was sure she could see her mate&#39;s mighty leg muscles twitch through, and she was definitely sure she could see where his equipment was. He also had an orange vest that didn&#39;t cover all of his chest and abdomen, giving everyone a good view of well chiseled chest and abs, and while he wasn&#39;t as muscular as Andrew, Samson was more than man enough for Abby. The costume was completed with a plastic hardhat complete with holes for Samson&#39;s ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose we&#39;ll have to make due with showing off for an evening,&quot; Samson said with a shrug as he looked to Abby placing the clothes they&#39;d worn to the party in one of the lockers that were normally there for the Meat Market&#39;s &quot;stars.&quot; He didn&#39;t say it, but a part of him was more than ready to simply take Abby home, but that wasn&#39;t the purpose of the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Abby answered, &quot;and it&#39;s not like either of us really have anything to hide... I&#39;m just hoping I don&#39;t fall out of this... or quite literally bust out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll manage,&quot; Samson said politely, &quot;and if not, I&#39;ll keep you covered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samson slowly nodded, though their attention was soon drawn to aside as the others came out of a different aisle of lockers. Sarah and Malice came out in the costumes that Miss Vivian&#39;s shop had arranged for them. Sarah as an angel in what amounted to an all white swimsuit that left very little to the imagination with a set of small fake wings on the back and a gold halo held up with wire. Malice was in a costume that was the opposite, being a red swimsuit, that left little to the imagination with a pair of bat wings on the back of the swimsuit and a set of horns on a red hair band on her head. In there was also supposed to be a faux tail that went with it, but Malice didn&#39;t add it as it didn&#39;t really work with her own tail and thus she left it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... at least you&#39;re in the costumes the shop provided for you,&quot; Sarah gave a small grumble, though sounding more humorous than irritated. &quot;Simon didn&#39;t wear his...&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked up to the behind the two female Huskies to see Simon and Travis. Travis stood by in a pair of tight black pants that seemed to reflect the light that hit them off and thus glistened. It was then completed by a black jacket that also glistened in the light with sets of horizontal gold stripes and a plastic fireman&#39;s helmet. The jacket, however, wasn&#39;t closed and Travis&#39;s own spotted chest was easily visible. By contrast, Simon stood by in a plaid shirt and a pair of jeans. The top couple of buttons on the shirt were undone to let Simon&#39;s fur fluff out a little, but it was far more conservative than the costumes that Ms. Vivian&#39;s shop had provided.<br />
<br />
&quot;While the &quot;naughty cop costume&quot; might be fun... the academy has held various requirements related to modesty and the sorts of things expected from an actual officer of the law,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;they may not have a problem with me being at the party... but they require even their academy students to be &quot;professional&quot; in what is expected from Law Enforcement. Which would mean that any photo of me in anything that makes the impression that I&#39;ve done otherwise... could get me in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Samson assured Simon, his own modesty coming forward, &quot;While no Animalian really has anything to hide... that doesn&#39;t mean everyone is of the &quot;if you&#39;ve got it, flaunt it&quot; school of display.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what are you dressed as?&quot; Abby wondered, not really recognizing the outfit. A part of her thought &quot;Jason,&quot; but Simon didn&#39;t have a hockey mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Wolfman as done by Lon Chaney Junior,&quot; Simon gave a small chuckle and made a fake threatening posture with his arms raised and clawed hands open, &quot;A wolf Animalian as a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
He finished with a small howl. That earned a few laughs from the others. Simon&#39;s reasoning did make sense and Abby figured that some of Sarah&#39;s initial comment was just friendly teasing. There were times that she&#39;d noticed Sarah and Malice go back and forth on things that one would think that Malice was truly Sarah&#39;s twin sister rather than an uplifted pet and adopted sister. And that soon picked up as the joke on Simon&#39;s costume died down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I still don&#39;t get is why I have to be the devil?&quot; Malice grumbled to Sarah, &quot;I&#39;m a good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There were some moments before you were uplifted that would say otherwise,&quot; Sarah teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a puppy!&quot; Malice countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a bit overly forward with just about every male wolf in the Animalia Police Department, and then walked right into the men&#39;s room at Lyre High last year to voice your interest in Simon,&quot; Sarah teased again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... they were handsome and so is Simon,&quot; Malice answered defensively, &quot;I&#39;m not a bad girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither am I,&quot; Sarah answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, we&#39;re supposed to have funs, and our costumes aren&#39;t to represent WHO we are,&quot; Abby cut in, &quot;You&#39;re both good girls and if you stay good, I&#39;m sure Travis and Simon will have treats for you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby couldn&#39;t help but chuckle as Sarah and Malice began happily wagging their tails at that. It was mostly a jest, and with it being a Tuesday evening, they knew that Simon would have to head out pretty soon after the party in order to be back at the Nevada Police Academy before his classes started and have some time to sleep. But the fact that both of them responded so similarly was worth a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Travis agreed, resting a hand on Sarah&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Let&#39;s go out and have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
And they did have a good time. There was plenty of dancing and food that was presented that fit with the varied diets that Animalians could have, particularly in relation to those that were purely herbivorous or carnivorous which wouldn&#39;t be able to cope with many of the artificial substances in most candies. They managed some small conversations with others at the party and there was plenty of fun that they&#39;d all had. They wouldn&#39;t know of the actions of the &quot;Rat Queen&quot; and the police operations to rescue Jeremy Green over the music until the next morning when the local Lyre/Animalia paper gave a small update on the event, but they did have fun and had no serious problems.</p>
