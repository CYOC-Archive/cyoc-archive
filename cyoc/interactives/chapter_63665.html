<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a short nap Ryan awakes feeling refreshed.  He's changed back to his human form, but he's not the teen he once was.  No, it seems the transformation has aged him ten to fifteen years or so and he's now a fully adult male.  <br />
<br />
He explores his body; his chest has a thick mat of chestnut brown hair that runs down his belly to his wide curly bush, his face is fully bearded with about an inch of growth.  His arms and legs are hairy and his cock and balls are certainly nothing to be ashamed of.  He's quite muscular now, not in a body builder way, but more the sort of natural muscle a man has when he works hard.  Ryan is rather happy at how he has developed, in fact he thinks, he looks quite a bit like his father used to when he was this age.<br />
<br />
Spelstorm stirs, awakens and looks over at Ryan with a dreamy smile.  He has reverted to his human form too.  He's a lithe young man now, with lean but not over developed muscle.  Indeed, Spelstorm is not nearly as developed as his new mate.  He's almost smooth except for a little hair on his chest, some fuzz on his face and his pubic curls.  He is very pale with light dusting of freckles on his face and body.  His hair is a pale blond with a hint of red in it.  Ryan thinks to himself that there couldn't be a more attractive man in the world.  Spelstorm looks at you, love and lust in his expression.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My God you are a handsome wolf!&quot; he says and reaches over to touch your beard, caressing it, playing with it.  You lean into his caress as his fingers work through your beard, gently tugging and swirling it around his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why...&quot; Ryan begins to say and stops as his voice surprises him with it's deepness.<br />
<br />
He smiles, &quot;I you didn't expect your voice to be a man's voice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I didn't.&quot; Ryan rumbles in a deep baritone.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I bit you, I didn't know if you'd be male or female, if you'd be older appearing or remain the same.  The transformation seems somewhat random within given parameters.  You could have ended up being rather grandfatherly I suppose, but I'm glad you ended up like this.  You'll remain like this, now, forever somewhere in your early to mid twenties.&quot;  Spelstorm says and as he leans in to give Ryan a kiss he moves his hands down Ryan's furry chest to his now erect cock.  <br />
<br />
The two again begin their erotic play cluminating with Ryan blowing a huge load in Spelstorm's mouth.  As they lie together, Ryan sweaty and panting, Spelstorm gently caressing and nuzzling him in the afterglow, Fredrick enters the cell through the locked door.<br />
<br />
Spelstorm lifts his head off Ryan's furry chest, &quot;Yes, Frederick?  What's the matter?&quot; he says to his ghostly butler.  <br />
<br />
Fredrick smoothes his handlebar moustache and replaces his monocle, clears his throat and says, “We’ve found another young man; blond, rather portly.  He’s in the library.  He’s busy looking through the large “Thornwood’s Paranormal Bestiary” at the moment.”<br />
<br />
“Ah yes, that tome is quite captivating, I doubt he’ll notice anything for the next several hours while he’s looking in that book.” Spelstorm says.<br />
<br />
“Indeed.  What should we do with him, Master Russel?”  Frederick asks.<br />
<br />
Spelstorm looks at Ryan, “Do you know this young man?”<br />
<br />
“I do, my love.” Frederick raises an eyebrow at Ryan’s use of the intimate address, and Spelstorm shoots the ghost a grin.  Ryan continues, not noticing the exchange between servant and master. “That’s got to be Owen, he Jamie, Mike, Anna and I all came here on a dare.  You’re not going to hurt any of them, are you?”<br />
<br />
“I swear to you, as lord of this manor, they will not be harmed.”  Russel says to him with  a gravity in his young voice that speaks of the century or more he has lived.  “However, love, they’re here now and unfortunately, the manor is cursed.  It’s doubtful they will be able to leave, but they might still enjoy their life here.  Tell me, what does Owen like to do?  We have some need of help around here.”<br />
<br />
“Owen’s a real nature freak.”  Ryan says, “He loves being outdoors and being by himself in the woods.  He’s been rather bullied because of his weight, so he’s kind of reclusive and shy.”<br />
<br />
Frederick interrupts, “If I may, Master Russel, George needs some help with keeping up the gardens and wooded areas.  He could use an apprentice gardener.  He’s constantly complaining that it’s far too hard to maintain the estate’s grounds by himself.”<br />
<br />
“Excellent as always Frederick!”, Russel says.<br />
<br />
“Thank you Master”, the spectral butler says and gives him a small bow.<br />
<br />
“What will happen to Owen?”  Ryan asks.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to introduce him to George, I think he’ll like George.”  Russel smiled.<br />
<br />
“What’s George like?”  Ryan asked, a touch of nervousness in his voice.<br />
<br />
“George is the salt of the earth, a bit rustic and rough around the edges, but a good solid sort.  Huge, hairy…” <br />
<br />
“Hagrid?”  Ryan asks.<br />
<br />
“Hagrid… What’s Hagrid?”  Russel asks<br />
<br />
“A character from some books I read; big, burly, hairy, outdoors type; loves animals.  Half human-half giant.”  Ryan supplied.<br />
<br />
“Well, yes, close… except George is a bit like me, you see, he’s a Werebear.  George has been with me since I was a child and was transformed, of course as I was, by the curse.  He and Frederick here have been almost like  fathers to me after mine died in the war. Your friend Owen will be in good hands, or paws, and I rather think young Owen will rather like having the strength and power of a bear.  Frederick, would you mind opening the door, and could you bring us some clothing, oh and bring George to the library.  Ryan and I will be there directly.”  Russel says.<br />
<br />
“Very good, Master Russel.” Frederick said.  He unlocked the cell, handing the keys to Russel and then floated up, disappearing through the ceiling.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the library, Owen is looking through Thornwood’s Paranormal Bestiary, the vivid illustrations almost move on the page and the huge thick tome is full of the most amazing mythical animals.<br />
<br />
Owen is looking through the section on Werebeasts.  The shapeshiters were always his favorites from the RPG games he liked to play; the wily Wererat, the sleek Werefox, the bold Werewolf, the powerful Werebear, the agile Wereotter and so on, and that was just the mammal portion of Werebeast section of this most amazing book.  He felt like he could look through this book and read for days and not get tired of it.  Owen was so engrossed with the book didn’t even notice three figures enter the room and approach where he sat on the red velvet Victorian sofa.  <br />
<br />
A large, meaty, hairy hand on his shoulder broke the spell and Owen looked up into the black and silver bearded face of a truly massive man.  His eyes met with the sky blue eyes of the colossus before him.  The spell of the book still over him, Owen didn’t feel frightened or intimidated by the encounter.<br />
<br />
“Hello, muh name’s George, what’s your name?”  The behemoth rumbled out.  Owen’s mouth gaped a bit, trying to remember.  The book seemed to still have most of his focus and he answered, finally remembering,  in a somewhat absent tone, “Owen, my name is Owen.”<br />
<br />
Owen looked around now, there was a young blond man that he guessed was a little older than himself, around sixteen maybe eighteen.  Behind him with a hand on the young blond man’s shoulder, a taller, more imposing man with a thick chestnut beard.  Both were dressed in old fashioned gentlemen’s clothes that looked like they were from the Civil War era.  To the right of the blond, hovering slightly above the floor, was a rather formally dressed ghost, he looked like a butler.<br />
<br />
“Who are you?”  his mind was in a fog and he still wasn’t afraid.<br />
<br />
“I’m Russel Spelstorm, lord of this manor,” the young blond man said, “and I believe you already know Ryan,” indicating the man standing behind him, “this is Frederick, my butler,” Indicating the ghost, “and the large man in the gardener’s overalls and boots is George.”<br />
<br />
“Muh, pleasure, I’m sure.” George growled out, “How’d you like to come help me in the gardens?  I got some work for ya if ya don’t mind.”  Owen nodded, not even really thinking about how strange it was that his friend Ryan now looked so different, so much older or that there was a ghost a few feet from him.<br />
<br />
The big man held out his massive paw of a hand and Owen, setting the book aside on the sofa, took it.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take care good of him, Master Russel”, George said as he led Owen out of the library.<br />
<br />
“Thank you George.” Russel said as they left headed toward the back of the manor and out to George’s cottage.<br />
<br />
“Will he be OK?”  Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“He will be fine, the book’s spell only lasts a day and from the pages he was looking at, I’m guessing Owen will be quite happy with his new form, after George gives it to him, that is.  We should look for your other friends, I suppose,” Russel said to Ryan, “we don’t want them coming to harm; there are some things in the mansion that can be quite dangerous.”</p>
