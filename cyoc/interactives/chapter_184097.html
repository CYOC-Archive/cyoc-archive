<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa knew just how to stimulate her body to drive Jeff wild. And she proceeded to turn Jeff&#39;s eyes backwards in his sockets.<br />
<br />
But she wasn&#39;t aware how this would also stimulate her new body as she did this. Not having been in this position before she began to mount Jeff and had the most wild orgasm that she had ever had in her life. Jeff moaned loud enough to concern the neighbors and as both had the best orgasm that they had ever had they collapsed together and lay side by side.<br />
<br />
Having gone through this half a dozen more times before morning Jeff told Lisa that he had to get ready for work and needed to change back.<br />
<br />
Lisa just laid on the bed and within seconds they were back in their own bodies.<br />
<br />
It was several weeks before Lisa and Jeff would be able to get back together and try to body swap again.<br />
<br />
Why isn&#39;t it working Lisa paniced.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s ok. We had fun maybe it only works once.<br />
<br />
But that doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s ok we will try some other time.<br />
<br />
As they went out to go dancing Lisa was happy to get to a slow dance. She loved hugging up against his washboard abs. But as she held him close she noticed that Jeff had put on a bit of weight.<br />
<br />
Look at my little pookie bear. Are those love handles I am feeling.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s winter. Who doesn&#39;t gain weight in winter.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s ok I like a little cushion.<br />
<br />
They had the best time that night that they had since their swap.<br />
<br />
But it was hard to make time to see each other and it was late spring before they were able to get together and this time the weight was extremely noticeable.<br />
<br />
Lets swap. Lisa said. I want to be a fat man.<br />
<br />
Stop teasing me. I can&#39;t help it. I must have passed that stage in life where I just put on weight. I have been trying to work out but I go out and gorge myself after I work out. I can&#39;t imagine how big I would be if I didn&#39;t work out.<br />
<br />
So let me enjoy it for awhile. I think it&#39;s sexy.<br />
<br />
Sexy? Are you crazy? I&#39;m enormous.<br />
<br />
Oh Jeffey you are fine. I have faith in you. You will lose it all soon. Lets swap.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t mind swapping but this is not fun.<br />
<br />
Lisa once again tried again and still couldn&#39;t swap.<br />
<br />
Oh well. Lets go get something to eat I&#39;m ravenous Jeff said.<br />
<br />
If you say so but keep eating like that and this is going to get bigger.<br />
<br />
It was quite a few months before Lisa heard from Jeff again and it was phone call from him telling her he was in incredible pain. Your mother was a nurse surely you learned something.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know she said looking at the enormous Jeff that laid on the bed in front of her. She started to probe him and she felt something move.<br />
<br />
Jeff. How long has this been going on she asked.<br />
<br />
You mean the indigestion?<br />
<br />
No I mean the lumps moving around in your belly?<br />
<br />
Yea the indigestion. Ever since we swapped maybe a couple weeks after.<br />
<br />
I am going to take down these sweat pants.<br />
<br />
Well I am sorry but they are the only things that fit.<br />
<br />
Not a problem I just want to see what is going on here.<br />
<br />
There was an audible gasp as she took down Jeff&#39;s pants and saw that he wasn&#39;t wearing underwear.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not that bad.<br />
<br />
Not what I was talking about. Jeff I think I have bad news for you. Well bad news and worse news. The bad news is you are pregnant.<br />
<br />
How in the hell did I get pregnant?<br />
<br />
Well I am assuming that when we had sex when we swapped my body got pregnant and when we swapped back the embryo swapped back with you. That would explain all the weight gain.<br />
<br />
Well how the hell is it going to get out do I need to go to the emergency room?<br />
<br />
Well that is the worse news. It looks like you are in labor now and it&#39;s coming out your ass. So we are going to do a quick tutorial on the Lamaze method. And when I tell you to push you push. <br />
<br />
Lisa had Jeff breath and told him to push from time to time. The head is crowning. Soon the baby was coming out of his wrecked asshole. Fortunately Lisa had some theoretical training in birth. This helped as the child came out. But that wasn&#39;t all. As this child emerged Lisa saw another move in Jeff&#39;s abdomen. Here comes another. <br />
<br />
Oh please no. Make it stop. <br />
<br />
It is too late for that these babies are coming. She began to probe Jeff&#39;s abdomen.<br />
<br />
Jeff. How many times did we have sex when we switched. <br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know that was almost a year ago.<br />
<br />
Well think.<br />
<br />
About 6 or 7 times I think.<br />
<br />
Well I think there may be 6 or 7 babies in there and as the day progressed child after child popped from Jeff&#39;s ass. He would never be the same. Lisa put the babies to Jeff&#39;s man boobs and they were easily feeding the babies.<br />
<br />
As the last one emerged Jeff passed out and Lisa swapped bodies with Jeff and began to ride her comatose body with Jeff&#39;s rotund body. Jeff was asleep in Lisa&#39;s body from exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Lisa had sex with Jeff many many times that night and swapped back right before he woke.<br />
<br />
Lisa I had a weird dream. I dreamed I was pregnant with half a dozen of your babies.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a dream baby. Look at all your young ones. Jeff took a look at the babies surrounding him.<br />
<br />
Six? How in the hell did I have six babies and what am I going to do with all of them. <br />
<br />
Well those knockers you have there will be feeding them well for awhile but you better get use to taking care of those babies.<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t I&#39;m a man. <br />
<br />
Lots of men take care of their children.<br />
<br />
Well not in my family.<br />
<br />
Well those babies are going to have plenty of siblings coming along in about 9 months.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t!<br />
<br />
I did. Lisa said deviously.<br />
<br />
How many times?<br />
<br />
Well lets just call this first set a test trial. Then next one should show us just how many babies you can hold.</p>
