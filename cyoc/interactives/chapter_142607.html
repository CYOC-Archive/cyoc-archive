<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beth was the best person in my life.<br />
<br />
She always loved me and cared for me, even if it was hard. She never backed down when I was being difficult or challenging. And most of all, she loved me for me, not for what she wanted me to be.<br />
<br />
And (somewhat less importantly,) who could forget that body? Oh, she was perfect from head to toe: plump, kissable lips, triple G-Cup breasts, a tight, toned belly, and that ass... Dear god, she was the perfect woman, and the perfect girlfriend.<br />
<br />
And, as of two weeks ago, the perfect wife.<br />
<br />
She proposed to me exactly 8 months after my breakup with Tim. Some said I was moving too fast with her. I thought I wasn&#39;t going fast enough. I needed her in my life more than just sex. She cared about me and understood me. I knew this from the moment we first started dating. I wanted to be married by the end of the year, so I could start the rest of my life with her.<br />
<br />
Sadly, nothing ever works out the way we want it to.<br />
<br />
It was a normal Friday like any other. Me and Beth had just finished up another grueling week of work, and were ready to kick back and relax. We had a lineup of movies for the ensuing weekend, and were ready to start relaxing. I should note that I had put on quite a few pounds over the last 8 months. Previously 150 pounds, Beth had jokingly remarked that she liked her women &#39;thick and juicy&quot;. I guess that I took it way too literally, as I soon gained around 50 lbs, probably more. Beth never minded. She never said she was joking, and she never said that she wanted me bigger, she just let me exist as I did. She bought me looser, bigger clothes, abd she took up cooking. So maybe she did secretly like me like this. Or maybe she liked that my tits and ass were finally as big as hers.<br />
<br />
Either way, we were ready to start binging. Our first movie up: Star Wars: The Last Jedi. (Which was a total lie. Like, there was that one kid at the end that was totally a Jedi, so... Liars!)<br />
<br />
We had gotten up to the part with Rei and those mirroring copies of her on the island, when someone knocked.<br />
<br />
On first impulse, we thought it was one of two things: the pizza guy, who was bringing 2 large pizzas, one for each of us, or a friend/family member coming to drop off a gift. &quot;I&#39;ll get it&quot; Beth said, hopping off from the couch we were sitting on. She opened the door to greet the person at it, when she was lifted up and thrown across the room.<br />
<br />
I got up as fast as I could, which was difficult with my excess weight, and dashed over to see what the hell happened. In the doorway, stood a 7 foot tall hulking figure, with muscles that must have weighed over 300 pounds. He carried a thick beard on his chiseled face, and his startling blue eyes shone big and bright. Although I was registering the shock of Beth being shot across the room, and the fact that the guy looked nothing like anyone I ever saw, real or not, I recognized him almost immediately: it was Tim, my ex boyfriend.<br />
<br />
I wanted to scream at him, but he didn&#39;t give me the chance. Instead, he moved his heavily muscled arm abd grabbed the collar of my shirt, lifting me up with absolutely no effort. He spoke in a new, deep, almost sexy voice, &quot;Hello Harley. I&#39;ve missed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried to scratch at his huge hands, but I couldn&#39;t phase him. His skin felt like stone against my fingers. Instead, I resorted to my voice instead. &quot;What the FUCK are you doing?!?&quot; Probably not the best choice of words.<br />
<br />
Tim chuckled, and let me go, but I didn&#39;t fall. Instead, I was cradled by a field of magic energy, encasing me and keeping me in place. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m just here to take what&#39;s mine.&quot; Of course, he meant me.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you talking about? How on earth are you doing this?&quot; I screamed, noting that only my mouth and eyes could move.<br />
<br />
Again, he chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ve been training, Harls. Making myself perfect for you.&quot; He flexed one of his huge arms, making his muscles tighten and flex into huge, rock-hard slabs of meat. He repeated this action with his other arm, and then both at once. &quot;Of course, I had a little help.&quot; He reached down the neckhole of his tight t-shirt and pulled something out of it. It was a chain, wrapped around his huge neck, and on the chain, was the gold and silver hourglass.<br />
<br />
I tried to gasp, but I felt like that would worsen my predicament. &quot;That thing actually works?&quot; I said in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, does it?&quot; Tim said cockily. &quot;Well, let&#39;s test it.&quot; He unlinked the hourglass from the chain, flipped it over, and returned it to its place. As each grain of silver sand hit the bottom, it glowed a burning white. As did his eyes, which turned solid white, like two small stars. He rotated his head over to Beth&#39;s lifeless body, limp and frail. He simply thought, and his will was made reality. The body of Beth lifted up, and was given life again. She registered shock on her face, pure terror, before Tim began to fuck with her. He used his power over reality to turn her from a hot girl to an ugly one. Then he turned her into a guy. Then a pig. Then an insanely fat girl. Then her normal self, but 5 times bigger breasts. This went in for  one minute, cycling through a bunch of crazy forms, but then the last grain of sand fell into the bottom, and they all went cold and silent. Beth was stuck as a form close to her normal self, but with absolutely no breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;So then.&quot; Tim said, stowing the hourglass in his shirt. &quot;Now that we&#39;ve got that settles, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; He started to head out of the door with me in his grasp, but I finally found a way to break through the spell and blocked him from letting me out. He tried several times to dislodge me, but I kept in the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let her go, you asshole!&quot; Beth said, running up to him with a knife and trying to stab his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, grow up.&quot; He said, flinging her once again against the wall, but stopping mere seconds before she hit it, instead holding her there with his magic. &quot;Okay, then. How about this?&quot; He turned his head to me, and addressed me. &quot;Here&#39;s my proposition. You go with me, peacefully, and I let her live normally. But if you don&#39;t, I will throw you out of this house, and you will have to live with the knowledge that you let her die to try and save yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had to go with him. Nobody would forgive me if I let her die just to try abd save myself from whatever sick stuff he wanted to do to me. &quot;I&#39;ll go with you. Just let her be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim chuckled. &quot;An excellent choice.&quot; He flipped the hourglass over again, and Beth was returned to the couch, with her breast returned and her injuries fixed.<br />
<br />
I let myself go with him. He guided me down the stairs and into the alley by our building. He waved his hand, and a portal opened up, guiding me to who knows where.</p>
