<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brittany walked into the living room, and plopped down on the couch.  It had been an exhausting day, and her feet really hurt.  Her shoes had been bothering her at the mall; they seemed too large, ready to fall off, but also seemed to pinch her toes.  She easily slide off her shoes, and stretched her feet.  She briefly thought about Mary, but felt no guilt.  It wasn&#39;t her fault the oaf had big feet.  She looked at her own feet, with a little concern.  <br />
<br />
Were they always this long? she thought, as she massaged her sore feet.  They seemed to be the same length she remembered, but some reason they looked thinner, and not as wide. Her toes looked thicker, and her toenails looked a little thicker.  <br />
<br />
I need a pedicure, she thought.  Or at least a warm bath to soak my feet.  I think they are swelling up or something.  She looked to her hands, and noticed that they also looked different.  Her hands were smaller, with stubby fingers and thicker nails.<br />
<br />
I guess I need a manicure, too, she thought.  Her coat pulled tightly on her back, and she quickly brushed her concerns away as she returned to her more immediate problem.  Removing this horrid coat.  It felt even tighter than before, and the heat was becoming unbearable.<br />
<br />
She tried to shrug off the coat, but it remained firmly in place.  She tried tugging on one sleeve, but the coat remained firmly in place, not wavering an inch from its position.  <br />
<br />
What the hell, she thought. What kind of cheap coat did I buy?  Serves me right for going to some dinky little store.  I should sue that creep of a manager.<br />
<br />
Brittany tried to locate the cuff of the sleeve, but the edge seemed lost in fur.  It looked like it blended straight into the flesh of her arm .  She tried to reach inside the coat, near her neckline, but again she could not find a gap between the coat and her skin, just like it was attached to her skin..  <br />
<br />
What the hell is going on, thought Brittany, as she stood and walked into the nearby bathroom.  This is too weird.  I am getting this coat off now.<br />
<br />
She stumbled  a little as she walked,  and was surprised to see that when she stood again, the house seemed bigger.  Must be my imagination, she thought.  Her heart began to race, just a little.  When she entered the bathroom, she easily slipped out of her strapless dress, but the coat remained firmly attached to her shoulders.  <br />
<br />
A little too easily, she thought  with increasing fear.  I practically poured myself into that tight dress when I put it on.  <br />
<br />
She looked in the mirror while running her hands along the inside of the coat, desperately trying to find a gap she could use to pull it off.  But wherever she touched the coat was bound to her skin.  She was startled from her desperate attempt at freedom by the appearance of four strange lumps on her abdomen.  <br />
<br />
My god, she thought, is that cancer?  She brushed the lumps, and was rewarded with a tingle of pleasure.  As she turned them over in her finger, she realized that they were actually nipples.  Brittany was suddenly racked by several large sneezes.  With each sneeze she felt intense pressure in her face, followed by a nice release as she sneezed.  Looking in the mirror, she was shocked by her appearance.  Her nose had doubled in size, and appeared to pulling away from her face, like a muzzle.  Small hairs protruded her from her muzzle, and when she touched them, they tickled and she was rewarded with another round of hard sneezes.  When she finished, she was shocked to see that her ears had enlarged, almost to comic proportions, and resembled  a cross between a mouse and a rabbit. <br />
<br />
This isn&#39;t right, she thought. I need to get help.  She turned and reached for the bathroom door, and was surprised to see that the handle was much higher than she remembered.  Previously it was waist high, but no it seemed almost level with her chest.  The door handle slipped in her hands, and she lifted her hands to her face.  Her fingers and hands were even smaller, and now thick pads covered her palms. She made it out the door, and ran to the phone in the hallway. She began to dial 911, when she caught sight of her appearance in the hallway mirror.  The fur had now spread across her chest, and up her neck, and appeared to be spreading to her upper thighs.  <br />
<br />
Who can I call?, she thought, as her heart began to race even faster.  I can&#39;t let anyone see me like this.  I&#39;ll be a laughingstock.  I need help, but who can I trust?<br />
<br />
She dropped the phone, as she tried to think.  Sadly, Brittany&#39;s bad behavior had driven everyone away.  She thought she was so much better than everyone else, and didn&#39;t ever think she would anyone else&#39;s help.  So she humiliated and degraded everyone she knew.  Now she was paying the price. She was alone.<br />
<br />
A large knock startled her from her thoughts, causing her to gasp and jump.  Her heart seemed to race even faster, and she no matter how hard she tried, she couldn&#39;t make it slow down.  A second loud knock followed, and Brittany quickly located the source - the door to the garage.<br />
<br />
Of course, thought Brittany.  Mary is here.  I can get her to help and keep quiet about it. I have more than enough dirt to use to blackmail her.  She walked to the door, and said,&quot; Mary, Something terrible has happened and I need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another loud knock echoed off the door, followed by a gruff voice, &quot;Let me in!&quot;  The voice sounded strange to Brittany, deeper than she had expected from Mary.  It also sounded a little angry.  For a second she questioned whether it really was Mary.  Suddenly, the knock and the presence behind the door seemed very threatening, and she had the strange urge to find a place to hide.  Her heart raced at unbearable speeds.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s just Mary, silly, thought Brittany, as she continued to approach the door.  But her heart and body did not seem to believe her, and she couldn&#39;t shake her feelings of fear and dread.   &quot;Mary, is that you?  I&#39;ve had an accident, and I need your help.  Will you help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an awkward pause, during which Brittany thought she could hear heavy breathing.  The deep gravely voice replied, &quot;Of course, Brittany. I would be happy to help, my friend.  Just open the door, and let me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany was still apprehensive, but the door handle was now level with her head.  If she waited much longer, she might not be able to open it.  Gripping the door handle with both hands and using all her strength, she opened the door and was stunned by the strange creature before her.</p>
