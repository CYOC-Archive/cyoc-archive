<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon&#39;s body jerked and spasmed; he shouted and screamed as jolts of pain shot down his whole spine and throughout his arms and legs. His guts gurgled and twisted within him. Something was very wrong. Why had he been so stupid? Sneaking out and drinking a potion in a cottage... this &quot;witch&quot; could easily be murdering him. It would affect some other princes&#39; paths to the throne. What if this is all an elaborate assassination plot?<br />
<br />
He panted and huffed as the pain in his body simmered down to a dull throb all over, but he yelled again as another jolt worked its way down both arms, causing them to flail around in front of them before locking up straight and stiff. The arms started swelling, throbbing, swelling some more as joints snapped and bones creaked. The skin around them burned unbearably as it recolored into a deep blue-gray. The arms reflexively flapped a few times, stretched out even longer and widened, completely absorbing his hands. Damon pushed through the pain and forced himself to lift his left arm closer forward to look at it. It was huge and still swelling, and it had already flattened out into what could only be described as an enormous flipper. He forced himself to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh... What are you doing to me, ... you ... f-filthy peasant wench?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing exactly what you asked me to do. And I never said the myth potion would be painless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon was dropped down onto his belly by the jolt of pain that jerked his legs and splayed them out to either side. He was too exhausted to try and look back there but it felt about like what had happened to his arms. He just lay there looking hoping lose consciousness soon. He was quite convinced he was dying, no matter what the witch said.<br />
<br />
The witch pulled out a wand and used it as a sort of tractor beam to levitate him out of her cottage to a water line somewhat nearby. She was obviously straining more to keep hold of the wand by the time they got there, as though he were getting heavier. She finally set him down on his belly again on the mud of the lake shore. She lowered the wand and rubbed the sweat off her brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to thank me for that,&quot; she said, panting, &quot;but it&#39;s pretty clear you needed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince Damon just sneered at her from weary eyes as the pain slowed down to a dull ache in his four flippers. He was able to move them a bit. He heard and felt their flat undersides flap against the cool mud. He still didn&#39;t really comprehend how huge they were, much longer than his puny human body at this point.<br />
<br />
An explosive burst of pain tore through his whole spine from the back of his head to the top of his buttcrack. A forceful stretching had taken hold of him of his whole neck and torso, ripping his two ends further apart and making his back flippers slide through the mud away from his front pair. The burning sensation of his skin change filled his skin, his chest, his back, and a strange new surface area beyond his rectum. He let out an agonizing scream that became an unearthly screech as his neck and lower spine both pushed out farther. The burning took over his face and his whole skull reshaped, pounding itself into a new shape, sharping his teeth and molding itself into a fearsome snout.<br />
<br />
By the time it was over, he was so long on both ends that the witch had needed to run far out in front of him to make room for his growth. His neck was long and flexible, and symmetrically, there was another long flexible appendage on his rear end. He lifted up his large head off the ground, and quickly discovered that with just a slight motion he had lifted his field of vision way up above the tree line and high above the witch. He tilted his head down a bit to look at her, then easily twisted his neck around some more to look behind himself. He could look down at his own back with its deep-gray skin and finally realized just how enormous he had become. He was at least a hundred feet long, with flippers stretching out almost forty feet to either side. His long neck look and felt almost to his long tail, except that the neck had a head. He lifted the tail up in a symmetrical pose so that its tip was pointed toward his face. Then he flopped his massive tail back down and swung it around, smacking it against the thick mud that surround him beside this massive lake.<br />
<br />
Damon knew what he was now, and where he was supposed to go. He swiveled his head around, took one more look at the witch, and scooted himself deep into the lake water. He launched himself away with his flippers and his powerful tail, swimming farther out into his murky fresh-water home.</p>
