<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We should go in the water,” Lisa suggested.<br />
<br />
“No,” Bonnie replied without any hesitation, her thick sweater was still on despite the heat and Lisa friwned in response.<br />
<br />
“Wanna go walk down the beach?” Lisa asked but Bonnie just shook her head no and adjusted her glasses. Lisa frowned and looked across the beach her eyes settling on two guys at a volleyball court. A smile spread across her face and she flipped some of her purple hair back, “Okay, here’s the deal, there are a couple of guys playing volleyball over there. They’re kind of cute. If you play one game with me and we lose we’ll do what you want for the rest of the day. How does that sound?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Bonnie replied while looking up from her book. Her wrist was grabbed though and she was dragged out towards the volleyball court by her friend.<br />
<br />
Cameron and Bryce saw a decently attractive girl with dyed hair and a few piercings on her face drag a frumpy sweater bound girl onto the court.<br />
<br />
“Hello girls,” Bryce grinned and the girl on the other side waved at him while the other looked down. Bryce took the ball from Cameron and tossed it to the girl, “Ladies first.”<br />
<br />
Lisa picked the ball up and bumped it over the net. Cameron caught it with a bump, Bryce set it up, and Cameron proceeded to spike it at Bonnie who helped and flinched as the ball thudded to the ground next to her.<br />
<br />
“It’s just a ball,” Lisa told Bonnie while scratching her breast like it was sore.<br />
<br />
“I know,” Bonnie sighed in defeat as her bum came undone and her hair cascaded down her back longer than before.<br />
<br />
Cameron received the ball and glanced at Bryce with a frown. Neither girl was busty or sexy to watch. They were kind of just a punk and a meek loser. He leapt into the air and with a smack delivered a heavy blow to the ball that bashed onto the girl’s side with ease.<br />
<br />
“This is just like that time you dragged us to a dance and we didn’t get asked to dance once,” Bonnie complained while her sweater shrunk until it was a surf shirt.<br />
<br />
“Would you have rather stayed home and done nothing?” Lisa deamded while the purple in her hair faded to a natural brown colour.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god you two are annoying,” Bryce commented before Lisa picked the ball up and tossed it to Cameron. He immediately leapt into the air and spiked the ball. Bonnie ran at it but closed her eyes as she did resulting in the ball completely missing her body and hitting the sand instead.<br />
<br />
Bonnie opened her eyes and looked afraid while Lisa gave a deep sigh. The hairstyle she spotted began to change. The shaved portion over her left ear filled in until her hair was all the same length. Then with a shudder it began to cascade down her back. Long tresses of Brunette hair collecting into long clumps that hadn’t been present since she hit Jr. High.<br />
<br />
Bonnie on the other hand had her surf shirt and pants shrink in size. Sleeves and legs vsnished as the fabric tightened to the ever smaller portion of her body it was protecting. A full two piece bikini formed covering her tiny breasts and clinging to her tiny rear. She shivered feeling the lick of the wind on her body and her shuddering was distracting enough that Cameron had no issue spiking the ball onto her side of the court and taking advantage of her. The ball bounced and bumped against her leg. Bonnie sighed before gently rolling the ball under the net so it softly stopped at Bryce’s feet.<br />
<br />
“Come on Bonnie,” Lisa insisted with a sorrowful look at her friend. Her hair began to style itself into a braid while she spoke. An intricate weave appearing behind her shoulder, “I just wanted to do something with you.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, it’s just cold,” Bonnie whined as her flat chest began to push outwards. Nipples pressed against the bikini top while the boys watched their opponent’s now impressive breasts pop out of her chest with smiles on their faces. They halted at a massive D-Cup and Bonnie stumbled thanks to the weight.<br />
<br />
A similar stumble caused her to miss the next ball and plough right into the sand unfamiliar with the weight on her chest. Immediately her ass inflated to match the curves on her chest and she stood up in embarrassment finding her entire body frame wasn’t working. She stumbled back and forth with her assets jiggling while Lisa shook her head, a wave of smoothness passing over her face as her piercings melted into the skin leaving her once studded face clear and bright.<br />
<br />
Bryce caught the ball when it rolled under the net and he tossed it back to Cameron who took a deep breath before leaping into the air and spiking the ball as hard as possible. Bonnie made a run for it but her disproportionate weights caused to stumble and fall into the sand again. The ball rolled out of bounds after it collided with the sand and scored the boys a point. Lisa walked after it, failing to notice a small bump appearing on her belly. She bent down to pick the ball up while Bonnie rose to her feet again, except this time her body began to shift. She rose upwards in height while her shoulders popped out. Her biceps gained some definition while her hips and thighs expanded. Her new curves and height caused her belly to take on an hourglass figure as her body settled into a new form built for the curves she now sported.<br />
<br />
Bryce raised an eyebrow and exchanged a look with Cameron. Smug looks came over their faces along with a plan to make Bonnie move as much as possible. Her swimsuit was just loose enough to make her body jiggle every time she ran and the more they could make her move the better she looked.<br />
<br />
“Oh this is just like that time you dragged me to the roller rink,” Bonnie complained as her friend tossed the ball to Cameron.<br />
<br />
“If I recall correctly you kept falling on your ass,” Lisa snickered while Bonnie blushed heavily.<br />
<br />
Cameron leapt into the air while they were distracted and spiked the ball right at Bonnie who backed up in order to hit it. Her breasts jiggled up and down in a hypnotic fashion and to make the show better the ball smacked her right in the chest and made her yell in pain and fall down. She proceeded to rub her boobs while Cameron and Bryce watched. No one noticed as Bonnie’s messy and long hair began to style itself. A tie caught it at the base of the head and the plume of hair was tied down by a second tie near the bottom. Her bangs fell over her face and brushed to the side hiding half the vision from her right eye. Lisa’s belly bump meanwhile expanded outwards a little more.<br />
<br />
Cameron clearly wanted a repeat of that last motion because Bonnie had to dodge the next serve. It pounded the sand inches from where she had been seconds earlier. Her feet hit the soft sand and she immediately kicked it back to Bryce while a bright blue streak appeared in her hair. The electric colour standing out against the fading brown which was looking blacker every second. Bonnie blew the blue portion blocking her vision out of her eye and narrowed those eyes at the boys. Meanwhile Lisa’s belly bump became unmistakably a baby bump. She was clearly a few months along in a pregnancy all of a sudden and no one reacted to the development.<br />
<br />
“Watch where you’re aiming!” Lisa shouted as Cameron caught the ball.<br />
<br />
“Not my fault your friend’s a wuss,” Cameron laughed before leaping into the air and delivering a hard serve. It sailed directly to Bonnie who dodged out of the way with a yelp again. Her glasses clattered to the sand and when she bent down to pick them up the lenses had darkened. Everything was also a lot clearer. She blinked and put the sunglasses up in her hair before scooping up the ball and bunting it over the net with a hard kick. Lisa meanwhile developed further into her pregnancy as her bump became even larger. She began to rub it in a motherly way while Cameron caught the ball again.<br />
<br />
The next serve proved to be a bit strange for Bonnie. She was overcome with a sudden lack of fear and actually bumped the ball, right into the net. Her arms stung from the hit and she yelled and rubbed them. The pain spread across her left arm as black bruises began to form. It spread over her shoulder and down part of her chest before suddenly other colours began to leak into the bruise. Then the pain stopped and the bruise began to form shapes and patterns. A long tattoo sleeve featuring a winding dragon with blue scales drawn up her arm. The maw was near her shoulder and artistic renderings of water splashed all over the skin above and somewhat onto her left breast. She scratched her new tattoo while Lisa’s breasts grew in size filling with milk. <br />
<br />
“Mmm,” Lisa groaned as her swllen breasts spiked in pain, a random cramp or something.<br />
<br />
When Cameron next served the ball it hit the sand thanks to Lisa’s slowed speed. She waddled across the sand but the point had been scored before she could even get there. Her baby kicked, almost like it was mad at her. Meanwhile her mind began to fill with worry and caution. Bonnie on the other hand felt sharp pricking in a few areas on her body. A belly button piercing appeared in her friend’s skin navel while a nose stud, eyebrow piercing, and at least a dozen extra piercings appeared in her friend’s ears.<br />
<br />
Lisa kicked the ball in a careful fashion, making sure not to hurt her toes. Cameron took it swiftly and served the ball, it sailed through the air and thanks to both girls being meek now it wasn’t even bumped. Lisa’s newfound caution grew in size, she could still recall dragging Bonnie to things but now ever since one of her risks had gotten her pregnant she had become more cautious and anxious about everything.<br />
<br />
Bonnie on the other hand felt her anxiety wash away. Suddenly the ball didn’t seem scary and the next time it was bunted over the net she actually hit it without an inkling of fear. Her wrists smashed into it over and over again in a parry with Bryce until she bumped it into the net again and it rolled to the ground. Her chest was popped out and she shoved a hip the side while flicking some hair behind her head. She then bent down at the waist giving the guys a full view of her now voluptuous cleavage. A sexy confidence rocked her body as she became aware of how hot she was and how men liked to stare. She enjoyed the stares all of a sudden and enjoyed standing and walking in a sexy way. She went from a virgin to being experienced with sex. She’d been with a number of guys for various reasons including hardcore relationships and one night stands when she was feeling frisky. She threw the ball back to the guys as Lisa’s memory of walking over here changed.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go play volleyball with those cute boys!” Bonnie had suggested while lowering her book. Lisa had drowned in response but her friend had eventually dragged her pregnant butt into the sand. Bonnie had taken over the risk taking ever since the pregnancy.<br />
<br />
The next serve was chased by Bonnie who enjoyed the feeing of her chest bouncing up and down. She bumped the ball out of bounds and clenched her eyes closed as evenings at home transformed into nights being ground on at the club, attempting everything that sounded cool ranging from skydiving to cage diving with sharks. Bonnie’s muscles grew a little as knowledge on how to surf, skate, and play volleyball filled her mind. She had been on high school sports teams, she had taken those school trips to europe, and she had taken Brennan Varsecs offer to go to her first party. Lisa meanwhile felt her party days abruptly stop seven months earlier. Relaxing nights at home had taken over her life, she’d gained a newfound interest in reading, and hadn’t thought about drinking and partying for the entirety of her pregnancy. Her eyes drooped contently as the boys received the ball again.<br />
<br />
Cameron’s serve was aimed at her and she was once again too slow to hit it. She sighed before her memories changed. She’d never been to a party, she’d never drank, and she’d been career focused all her life. A meekness came over her unlike any else. Meanwhile Bonnie felt more recent memories change. As her skating skills got better and better in her head. She gained even more muscles for the sport while memories of cycling also pressed into her mind. She had been a career athlete since graduating.<br />
<br />
The ball hit the ground again and Both girls suddenly overcome with a twitching. Their ages increased until they were both twenty four. Bonnie suddenly recalled being an Olympic athlete. Winning gold in figure skating, competing in speed skating and coming third, and cycling in the summer games.<br />
<br />
When the ball hit the ground again Lisa was overcome with desire and scurried over to Bonnie. She grabbed the girl by the cheeks and planted a passionate kiss on her lips. Bonnie returned it while Lisa’s belly quivered and began to shrink. At the same time Bonnie’s expanded. The boys took advantage of this and hit the ball into the court again. Lisa shot upwards in height while her shoulders broadened. Her breasts shrunk into pectoral muscles and her vagina burst forward into a penis. They kissed passionately while seven month pregnancy fully transferred to Bonnie. Rings appeared on their fingers while Lisa’s hair shortened and body hair exploded into every limb.<br />
<br />
The couple seemed far too interested in one another so Cameron scored another point turning Lisa’s bikini into a tank top, cargo pants, and boots. The cargo pants took on a camoflauge appearance Lisa’s muscles expanded. Tears began to roll down the couple’s faces and they tried to talk through the kissing and tears. Cameron groaned and scored another point. Lisa’s skin took on a slight tan as his features rearranged themselves to be Asian American. His hands felt up his wife’s belly while Cameron scored a final point and the boys forget they had even been playing these two. Some army guy and some pregnant hot girl had run across the sand at each other and embraced.<br />
<br />
“I missed you Lee,” they heard over the kissing and Lee suddenly had memories of just seeing his wife pregnant. They’d had sex right before he left on tour and she’d told him multiple times but seeing her bloated with child was completely different. His saucy risk taking wife who wanted to do everything even remotely exciting was now plump and with child.<br />
<br />
“Can you two move it!” Bryce ordered and the couple dropped their embrace and held hands while giggling before running up the beach to where Bonnie had set herself up. She hadn’t expected him home yet and she was crying because of it. Ugly happy sobbing running down her face. She moved black hair out of her eyes and held Lee’s arm close not wanting to let go. She had him back and felt like if she let go he would vanish again. He rubbed her head and shushed her through her tears but couldn’t stop his own.<br />
<br />
“We can’t have welcome back sex,” Bonnie managed to choke out.<br />
<br />
“You know what’s better than welcome back sex?” Lee asked with a slight chuckle, “We just made a baby sex...”<br />
<br />
“She’s due on the eighteenth of September,” Bonnie admitted.<br />
<br />
“Then it’s a date,” Lee laughed before she glared at him. He chuckled and held his hands up, “I’m kidding, we’ll do it when you feel ready.”</p>
