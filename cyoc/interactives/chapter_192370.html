<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was 5:00AM at the daycare, a few employees stayed the night there to wake up the kiddos before they turn back to adults, or to at least get them out of diapers before the spell wore off. There was a few employees slowly picking the kids up one by one out of the main sleeping area and taking them to a changing room. <br />
<br />
No exception was Jason and Becky. One daycare worker saw how close they were together and smirked, “looks like these two had quite the night together,” he whispered to himself. He decided that they should be in the same changing room together. <br />
<br />
They all hurried quickly to make sure each baby was in a room, that way they could get them out of diapers before the spell wore off, it could be any minute now. Mik and Bradley were also in a room together, how ironic. Those two could be found anywhere together, wet or dirty. <br />
<br />
Once the daycare worker took off their pajamas carefully to not wake them up, he then untamed each diaper to see if they were dirty or not. Jason and Becky both had some dampness in their diapers, but not soaked. <br />
Regardless, they were wiped down carefully while they were conked out, their pacifiers did help them to stay asleep. <br />
<br />
Once both of them were cleaned, the daycare worker brought their clothes from the night before and placed them in the changing room. This way they could change quickly and head home before going to work. Jason and Becky were both left wearing nothing until the spell wore off, the daycare employee did decide to keep both of their pacifiers in their mouths in order to keep them asleep. They were each laid on the floor with their blankets from the night before. <br />
<br />
Shortly thereafter, the spell started wearing off, Jason and Becky started slowly growing back to adult size. Their progression moving them from kid to teen to young adult at a moderate pace. Once they finished, their were two adults sleeping on the floor with baby-sized pacifiers in their mouths, it looked kind of funny at first glance seeing such a sight. <br />
<br />
Jason and Becky both slowly woke up to regain consciousness, not realizing they were fully grown adults until they saw each other. They both blushed and quickly took their pacifiers out of their mouths, each giggling at the sight. <br />
<br />
Once they got a good look at each other, they then started to wonder what to do next, they had never seen each other naked. It didn’t help that they just met last night as toddlers and are seeing each other’s adult bodies for the very first time. <br />
<br />
“Uhhhhhhh……,” Jason stammered. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, ummm…., Becky replied awkwardly. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t we get changed quickly?” Jason said quickly to avoid any further awkwardness. <br />
<br />
Becky agreed and they each grabbed their respective clothing articles. Once they got changed, they then took a good look at each other. Jason thought Becky was kind of cute as an adult also, but he wanted to play it safe. <br />
<br />
“So, where you headed off to after this?” Jason asked. <br />
<br />
“Oh just going home to get ready for work.” Becky replied<br />
<br />
“Oh, right. Work.” Jason stated disappointingly, as if he wasn’t looking forward to work. <br />
<br />
“I know, it’s kind of hard to think about that after the night we just had,” said Becky, “especially with the fun we had to…..” she teased him. <br />
<br />
Jason blushed furiously, finding it hard to come up with the words needed to continue the conversation. “It’s ok, I like you too to be honest,” Becky bluntly stated, “I haven’t met anybody who loves being a baby every now and then like I do.”<br />
<br />
“Wow really?!” Jason exclaimed. “I would figure you would have already made tons of friends with how awesome you are!”<br />
<br />
It was Becky’s turn to blush now, “……thanks.” She stated bashfully. <br />
<br />
After a long pause between the two, Jason suggested an idea, “well why don’t I walk you back home? We can grab some coffee on the way if you would like?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’d like that.” Becky replied, receiving a brief smile from Jason, he really was handsome to her. <br />
<br />
They both walked out quickly in order to avoid being seen by Mik and Bradley, though they did see the two joke about each other’s penis size while they were naked, not a surprise to Jason even though he just met the two last night. <br />
<br />
Once they got outside, Jason and Becky started walking together towards her apartment complex. Along the way, Becky snuck her hand to meet Jason’s and hold it lightly. Jason was caught off guard, but smiled warmly at her as they walked together.<br />
<br />
The beginning of a new companionship started by a drink called the Youthenizer. <br />
<br />
Jason and Becky grabbed coffee and the they arrived at her complex. They stared at each other and said goodbye to each other. Before Jason could go, Becky called out her name, he turned around and Becky met his lips with a quick kiss, which surprised Jason completely. <br />
<br />
“…………..” he just looked at her with a stunned reaction.  <br />
<br />
“You deserved it after making friends with me at the daycare last night. I enjoyed every minute with you,” she told Jason. <br />
<br />
“………..yeah I did too. It was fun and I……….I would…….umm……..,” he struggled to find the words to ask her out again. She could read his mind point blank though. “Yes, I would love to meet you again, my number is……,” Becky replied. Jason copied her number into his phone. They quickly said their goodbyes, both trying to get to work on time. <br />
<br />
Jason turned and left once he dropped her off and she went in her apartment. He had the biggest smile from ear to ear. <br />
<br />
He started wondering what their next time together would be like……</p>
