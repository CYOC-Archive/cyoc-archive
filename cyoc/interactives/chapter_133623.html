<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Running up the driveway, you look up at the outline of the house when a crack of thunder followed by a flash lighting bright enough to light up the sky. You were soaked by the time you got to the porch as it was raining down hard. "Damn. It was suppose to be clear for the next two days. Where did this crazy storm come from?" asking yourself this question while you hurried and run up the steps of the porch, to the front door.<br />
<br />
You reach the door to find an old style pull on the bell, which you pull for it to ring while hoping someone's home to hear and answer the call of the bell, but you can't hear it ringing anywhere inside. As you had approached you were able to see that It was covered that it didn't make much of a difference when the wind was driving the rain onto it. it was a big house as it could be an old one too that you thought This place was big enough to have its own zip code while you take in the sprawling, five story, Victorian style mansion before you.<br />
<br />
soon after a minute had past by that you knocked on the door, yet there was no answer. As you stand there waiting that with no other options, you started Looking around. "Come on. There has to be someone living here." you said as you then spot a barn that the lights were on. you quickly ran to the lit up barn as you soon after enter it.<br />
<br />
"he, hello? Anyone here? I saw the lights were on as its raining like crazy out there." by the time you were in that you soon heard a voice. "what are you doing here? Get out of here, now! Before she gets you too."<br />
<br />
I didn't stop to think about it, but perhaps I should have that it was just then a flash of lighting causes you to leap back in fright. Once your heart stopped while trying to escape your chest as it was basically your heart almost jumping out of you that it didn't surprised you when you noticed the animals. seeing cows were in their stalls as pigs were in a muddy pig stye pen that even a few chicken were nesting in their nest as some had eggs, but no horses.<br />
<br />
you decided to look around and see where the voice came from, but you came up short when you were up to a cow's stall. "strange, for some add reason that I thought I heard someone talking to me." you said to yourself while scratching behind your head, but what came next shocked you as you weren't prepared for what was happening that you almost fell over.<br />
<br />
"Listen to me. You must leave, now! before she gets you too." said a black bull as you back up in fear, but soon bumped into someone that quickly turn around to see a woman standing before you. She had long black hair with brown eyes as She was mush taller than you that even if she weren't wearing any high heels, She looks great for her age as she was perhaps in her mid 40s.<br />
<br />
She was wearing an old fashioned dress that She was carrying a lantern as you could see there were no lights on inside the house. Beside her was a young man. He looks to be about your age, mid twenties, as his posture looks to be some kind of submissive, yet strong looking servant, or even a butler. He seems to be nice as he doesn't say a word while staring at me, specifically at my sopping wet clothes as another flash of lightning that This caused you to jump back a bit.<br />
<br />
"Oh, hello there. Oh my, you're soaking wet! Come, lets get out of this rain and into the house before you catch a death cold." the woman said. it suddenly reminded you of some old horror movies you've seen as You slow your breathing and heart rate down once again while remembering that this isn't a movie, this was real.<br />
<br />
 "thanks you. Sorry to barge in like this, but My car broke down as I saw the house, but when I came answer the door by both knocking and ringing the door bell that i saw the barn lights on. when i came in though that I thought one of your cows just talk to me. that basically sounds up the story till i met you guys." you said, but she giggles a bit. "Oh, that's an interesting story you got there, but Animals don't talk. the storm must of messed up you brain up there that You must have been hearing things." Said the old lady while you accepted her offer to enter her house.<br />
<br />
once in side that another Lightning had flashed just as door opened. "My name Madame Morphia and this young man you see before you is buck. might we ask of your name sir." you soon introduce yourself as Ginji, but everybody calls you Gin while The woman gazes at you. Dripping on the foyer rug that you quickly apologies, but she waves you off by telling you not to worry about it.<br />
<br />
"now now, Don't you worry about your little head of yours. besides, It is only going to get worse out there. yet, do to this storm and all that I'm afraid it'll be near impossible getting any help for your motor vehicle. You can stay here, in this house until the storm clears over." she said while you Glanced out for she was right, you see that it is indeed getting worse when large chunks of hail start to fall.<br />
<br />
Moaning in despair, you turn back to Madame Morphia. "Do you have a phone I could use Ma'am?" you asked that at the very same time a crack of thunder followed by another flash of lighting, nearly causing a black out through the night air. she directs you to where the phone rests as you soon Pick it up while thanking her that you lift the hand-piece up to your ear and hear nothing coming from it.<br />
<br />
not giving up hope of it not working yet that you click the phone a couple of times or it to start working, but to no use as you then look at Madame Morphia. "uh miss, Something's wrong with the phone. I am not getting a dial tone here." you say that you then hand over the telephone to her as she reaches out a hand as she Listens, but she shortly after sets the phone down.<br />
<br />
"I'm sorry dear, but I'm afraid the power of the storm must of caused the Phone to be knocked out again. I'm almost lucky enough to have lights yet still." she explains that you were hoping to use your phone to let people know you were ok, But how funny things work as you couldn't do such a thing because of the storm. Nodding your head as you understood that you soon thank her again and asked her a question.<br />
<br />
"Is there another house nearby that I could try." you ask, but she shakes her head and then looking out the windows on the front doors. She then tells you that its Not wise of you to go out there anymore as It was only getting to get worse for she was right, it continued to do so. This place is miles from the town as your girl friend lives within my hometown that it was further away from where you are now, even your heart sinks in disappointment and fear for her.<br />
<br />
"Just my luck. she's going to be worried about me while wondering if I made it home, or if I'm laying on the side of the road hurt." you said rolling your eyes. you couldn't sleep in a car overnight as anything could happen to you in the storm that Madame Morphia must have read the frightened expression on my face because she continued.<br />
<br />
"I'm not going to throw you out on the street into this terrible storm, but I might throw you in the barn. now don't you worry my dear, for that was a little jock. It happens at times for as you can see, my home is rather large that I'm sure we can find space for a little thing like you in one of the spare rooms." Madam Morphia said as you were very grateful, but a little embarrassed. your not that little, are you?<br />
<br />
"Think nothing of it. i'm always happy to help people when I can, yet Perhaps we should get you out of those wet clothes of yours. your soaked to the bone as I'm sure I've got something for you to wear hidden away somewhere for the night." Madam Morphia said while waving it off that she then turns to Buck and tells him just what to do.<br />
<br />
"Buck, Take Mr. Ginji here up to one of our guest rooms as i'll have dinner ready soon." Madame Morphia said, but soon kneels down to his hear so that you wouldn't hear what she was saying to him. "you may Fetch him a towel for him to use. make sure he is comfortable as i'll bring some of the clothes up for him myself, unless you want to have that black goat head again. you know, the one with the red eyes." he knew what she was talking about as this was the image that crawled back into his mind like a bad memory. <br />
<br />
after she was done whispering something to him that she quickly told you Buck here will be showing you to the guest room as you thanked her once more. she soon left for the kitchen when Buck approached you. "if you would just follow me please sir. It's easy to get lost in this place if you don't know your way around, so stay close. i'm sure will be be there very soon." he said while walking a few steps up some stairs.<br />
<br />
"Your too kind Buck!" you say with genuine delight as your skintight boxers were even wetter then you thought, if you were wearing them that you were wearing your little sister's small yet silky tight pink panties instead. you sometimes were female clothing in secret that only your girlfriend knows what you were as she also knows you sometimes wear skin tight animal suits, baby out fits with dippers, and your regular clothing.<br />
<br />
You followed Buck up three flights of stairs down several corridors in the hallway. With all the twists and turns as you follow the young man, who seems to be no older then twenty five that you notice him looking back to get a quick glimpse of you while seeming to be very nervous. you find it curious as he seems to be hiding something from you.<br />
<br />
After a while from one corridor to another was then you realize that there is no way you could navigate this place by yourself. you could see why it would be easy to get lost in a place like this as he seems to know it by heart. as you were Looking at the young man again that Instead of paying to mush thought on it, you silently follow.<br />
<br />
it wasn't long till you Finally reached to the guest room as Buck stopped and opened the door to a luxurious room. apart of you really didn't want him to just go yet, but he has his job to do as you purr With a big grin on your face that you thanked him. "Why thank you kind sir. i look forward to be taken care of in your hands Buck."<br />
<br />
"please, Buck is what she calls me as a nickname. my real name is Baphomet." he said while standing there to see if you needed anything else. you couldn't believe it as he was named after one of the seven demon lords that you thought he couldn't be the same person, could he?<br />
<br />
you were stun for a moment as you quickly asked if he was the same guy, but to your relief that he answered no. "not necessarily. you see, it's a long story for another time to tell. miss Morphia should be up later herself to lay out some suitable night clothing for you by the time you finish taking your wet clothes off. do not worry about your clothes as you can just leave them in the bath that they will be taken care of, but you are late for dinner. breakfast is served at seven sharp till nine am in the morning. I'll be leaving now so you can get out of your wet clothes and freshen up that by the time you come out is when dinner will be ready. I will show you the dining room once you step out of the bathroom, till then Have a good night." he said while he points to another room before leaving the room and closed the door behind him as You shrugged and went into the bathroom and shut the door yourself, but little did you know that once he banged his head gently on the door is when his head studly morphed into a a black goat with red eyes.<br />
<br />
almost crying a bit that he knew Ginji couldn't see him like this and returned his head back to a hansom young man's head. starting to strip off your wet clothes that It was so much better having your wet clothes off, even the wet panties as you secretly hid them from your clothing in the bed. Whistling softly at the size of the bathroom that it was about three times the size of your bedroom back home as you then looked at an ornate, claw-footed, iron antique tub.<br />
<br />
Walking over to it, you turn the knobs while noting that they are backwards from what you are used to. Still feeling like you're imposing that you fill the bathtub as you later turn the water off and slip into the warm water. it was then Madam Morphia enters the bedroom that Looking out, you could see her set something on the bed, but you weren't just sure what since she is in the way. it was then she She chants a spell on them as she later knock on the bathroom doors and enters.<br />
<br />
Turning toward you that she offers to take your clothes so they could be washed and pressed while waiting for you in the morning as she started picking them up. she also told you that there was some nice clothes down for you to sleep with as there were more in the foot end of the bed's trunk. thanking her that it was Afterwards while finding a towel to dry yourself off with, you wrap a towel around your waist and drained the bath as you then exit the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Looking at the bed as there was a pile of nicely folded clothes on the bed and a tray of food on a desk that you Figured on eating first. you did felt a bit hungry as you went over and sat at the desk that you lifted the cover to find tonights dinner was a hamburger with cheese, fries with a cold glass of a blue raspberry slushy to drink, and a small salad. You quickly dug in as you were soon finished in about thirty minutes that you got up and went over to the bed to see what clothes Madam Morphia had brought up for you, after Wiping your mouth on a piece of napkin.<br />
<br />
Picking them up as they were mostly pajamas that To you're taken by surprise by what kind of pajamas they were laid out. one was a cow, as well as a horse, pig, goat, even an old fashioned nightgown when you thought of wearing it with your sister's secret, yet still wet panties. the ones on the end of the bed were mostly with animals on them that he remembered there was more in the trunk.<br />
<br />
opening it up as you started digging through them one by one that there was a pair of pink, footed pajamas which look like they would be worn by a toddler, but what falls to the floor while picking it up was a pair of white underwear with strawberries printed all over them. mostly filled with different pajamas that They don't look like they'd would even fit. After a minute of thinking, you Look around the room for a way to summon either Buck/Baphomet or Madame Morphia, but you can't find one as you then turn your attention back to the pajamas.<br />
<br />
"Am I suppose to wear these? if so then what one should I wear for tonight? Hmm...." you asked yourself while thinking about sleeping in nude, but something seemed to compel you to wear one to bed as you then thought about your sister's secret wet panties. What do you do now as there was more options in the trunk to wear?<br />
<br />
"Let go with this one!" you said, almost as if you decided what your decision was to wear for the night. You choose to...</p>
