<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mason Harris usually felt bored when he was in school. When he was at school, he would usually be thinking of being at home with his siblings, or in the kitsune realm with his kitsune family. A few times in his life, he wished he could tell some of the other kids who liked him at school about his family and history, but his mothers always told him never to tell anyone who wasn&#39;t associated with magic about magic or his kitsune heritage. He also missed Anjelica there that day, she had been home sick the last few days and wasn&#39;t allowed to see anyone.<br />
<br />
When school was finally over for the day, Mason began his walk home alone. Luckily for Mason, his school wasn&#39;t too far from his home, so it wasn&#39;t too far of a walk. Mason&#39;s family had always instilled in him to be cautious of strangers, and as he was walking on the sidewalk by himself, Mason felt a tingling sensation in his neck. He didn&#39;t know whether it was human instinct or some small amount of kitsune family blood in him, but he was as cautious as he could be as he made his way home. When Mason thought he might be in the clear and let his guard down, he felt a couple of hands grabbing him and Mason struggled to free himself, before he felt something being put on his mouth and pretty quickly began losing consciousness.<br />
<br />
When Mason woke up, he discovered he was in a building he didn&#39;t recognize, tied up to a chair with several people surrounding him that had emotionless faces on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason Harris,&quot; An older woman said who was standing over a table before him looking through a file. &quot;Mothers Mika Tozawa Harris, and Claudia Harris. Youngest sibling of Kari Harris, Haley Harris, and Aaron Harris. Yes Mister Harris we have been keeping our eyes on you for quite a little while now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you.....the Seraphim?&quot; Mason asked sounding a little concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, no Mister Harris, I&#39;m not the great Seraphim. I&#39;m one of the firm believers in the Superior Church and what it stands for. You may call me Miss Hopkins. You see Mason, we think you have great potential in you.&quot; The woman said.<br />
<br />
Mason noticed this Miss Hopkins looked to be around his mother&#39;s ages, and looked like she kept herself in good shape for her age.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see potential in me? In what way?&quot; Mason asked a little curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well simply put: you are a flawless individual in a flawed family.&quot; Miss Hopkins said as Mason now glared at the woman&#39;s remark.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? There&#39;s nothing wrong with my mom and siblings, they&#39;re all special in their unique way.&quot; Mason countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you see Mason, it&#39;s the WAY in which they&#39;re unique. Your siblings have....&quot; Miss Hopkins looked at the envelope before her. &quot;....kitsune and kintaro blood in them, as do your own mothers. But YOU Mason, you don&#39;t have that in you. We&#39;ve been keeping an active eye on you and your family as well as others and have seen that you stand out from your family and can be someone that represents what others like you can become. Normal, average, human. Think about it Mason: over the years, what has been the true cause of the trouble in the world? The Supernatural. It&#39;s up to individuals like us to keep those individuals from overpopulating the planet and becoming a stain on humanity.&quot; Miss Hopkins explained with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Mason thought about the woman&#39;s words before taking a deep breath and replying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may not be kitsune or kintaro like most of my family. But there is something I am that most people either don&#39;t know or forget. I&#39;m half Asian, from my mom&#39;s side both human and magical. When people look at me, they don&#39;t think of me as some Asian kid, they just see me as some plain blonde white boy. Well I&#39;ve known about bigotry for most of my life, and let me tell you lady. Human or kitsune, I&#39;m proud of my family and they&#39;re proud of me.&quot; Mason said with a smirk on his face as the woman tilted her head up and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right Mister Harris, Mason, but you know what I see in your future? Age. Your so called &#39;kitsune&#39; family? They&#39;ll live a lot longer than you, and most likely so will your siblings, and possibly even your mothers. Do you know what that means? Your own siblings will outlive you. By the time you turn 50, they&#39;ll barely look middle age, and by the time you&#39;re a senior citizen, they&#39;ll still look as youthful as they did today. Why live among them when you&#39;re not really one of them? You belong with a real family that will live as long as you do and be as human as you are.&quot; Miss Hopkins said as Mason didn&#39;t want to listen to the woman&#39;s words but he knew there was some truth to what she said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly an alarm went off, and the Superior Church agents went active as a few of them surrounded Miss Hopkins and Mason, while the others spread out around the room. Miss Hopkins then looked to activate a button that activated some metal doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever&#39;s in here, you should know you&#39;re locked in here with us now.&quot; Miss Hopkins said defiantly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly two Superior Church soldiers were taken down at once. A few of the men fired at the direction they had fallen and shot at what seemed like shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Miss Hopkins was it? How long ago did you take me?&quot; Mason asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two hours ago. We made sure no one would track us to this location.&quot; Miss Hopkins said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two hours? Oh, then you&#39;re in trouble. Because there&#39;s two people that would&#39;ve come looking for me. And I think.....&quot; Mason and Miss Hopkins now saw a shuriken hit one Superior Church member in the forehead instantly killing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....yeah, my aunt&#39;s here. You are very much doomed.&quot; Mason said as Miss Hopkins stood nearby watching as more and more members of her forces were taken down before there was just one other member left.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for idiot? Go find her!&quot; Miss Hopkins demanded as the agent rushed into the darkness as Miss Hopkins and Mason heard a scream and then silence.<br />
<br />
Miss Hopkins now got very angry as she wrapped her arm around Mason&#39;s neck while holding a gun to Mason&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give up now or your precious nephew is going to get a bullet through the face!&quot; Miss Hopkins ordered.<br />
<br />
Abolith slowly walked out from the shadows with her hands up and in one of her hands, she was holding a kunai knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Toss the knife away! Do it, or he dies! Believe me!&quot; Miss Hopkins demanded as Abolith tossed her knife away at a strong angle that it ricocheted across the walls before going into the muzzle of Miss Hopkin&#39;s gun and misfired into her forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you.&quot; Abolith said as she now came over to untie Mason and looked him over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you hurt? Did they drug you?&quot; Abolith asked sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they didn&#39;t hurt me, they just put some choloform over my mouth and brought me here. How did you find me?&quot; Mason asked as Abolith raised her eyebrow at Mason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, I forgot who I was talking to for a moment.&quot; Mason said with a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you didn&#39;t come home, your mothers contacted me and asked me to find you.&quot; Abolith explained as Mason nodded his head while remaining quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Abolith now asked seeing the slightly sad look on Mason&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That woman.....she told me....a harsh truth. My siblings, maybe even my moms, Fukushu, Raiden, Stella, and you will all live longer lives than me, while I....while I will probably die sooner than most of you.&quot; Mason explained as a tear escaped from his eye.<br />
<br />
Mason was then surprised when Abolith suddenly and unexpectedly gave Mason a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;However long you may live Mason, know that you are family, you are part of my family. I....know I don&#39;t say this often to you, but.....I love you Mason.&quot; Abolith said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Abolith.&quot; Mason said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s get you home. Mika has been worried sick about you.&quot; Abolith said as she and Mason left the building with a bunch of dead Superior Church agents behind them.</p>
