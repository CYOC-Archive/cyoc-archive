<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron just must have been the first to arrive, as now other adults were being led into the library and sat at tables of their own. There was a few things pretty consistent about all of them. They were all middle aged, between mid thirties and sixties, all seemed to be alone, and not a single one had a kid with them. They also all seemed as confused as Aaron felt. Some were sat at the same table as Aaron, but they didn&#39;t talk with each other, the librarian gave a very sharp glance to anyone who decided to talk.<br />
<br />
With a sigh he picked up the form and looked at it. With nothing better to do he began to fill it out. He wasn&#39;t sure if he was filling it out for his non-existent kid, or if it was what he wished he had done in high school, but he slowly went through each question, scribbling off answers. Some he had to guess or just make something up. How old was a freshman in high school anyway..<br />
<br />
Name: Aaron Lewis<br />
Age: 14<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Last Year GPA: 3.5<br />
Best Subject: History<br />
Worst Subject: Math<br />
<br />
There was even a little essay portion about what you like and dislike in each of those subjects. Aaron tugged at the collar of his shirt. It felt strange, like he wasn&#39;t used to wearing a collared shirt and tie. At least the chair seemed a bit more comfortable, like if fit him better. Scratching at his head he actually was giving thought to the question. He barely noticed that his hair felt thicker than it had been in years, and definitely longer. He had started shaving it close to his scalp when he had started balding, but his hair was growing in thick and full. He could feel it brushing the tips of his ears, some of it even got in his eyes.  Blond? He wasn&#39;t blond. His hair was black and starting to grey.. no.. that&#39;s ridiculous. He&#39;d always been blond. He pushed up the sleeves of his shirt, the thick dark hair on his forearms lightening and thinning as he did so. This next part was on extracurricular activities.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sunwood Academy students are expected to participate in at least two and no more than five extracurricular activities.<br />
<br />
Would you like to try out for any athletic teams? If so, which?<br />
Wrestling, baseball.<br />
<br />
Aaron had never played sports in high school, but he always wished he had tried out, especially for those two teams. He scooted his chair in closer to the table. Why had he been sitting so far back? No.. he had to sit back, those extra pounds in his gut just wouldn&#39;t come off.. Aaron ran a hand over his flat stomach, wondering where those thoughts came from. He&#39;d always been fit, he liked to run around and keep active. He rubbed at his chest through his shirt. Why did it feel odd to have smooth skin there? He let the thought float off and continued with the form.<br />
<br />
Would you like to try out for any of the academic teams? If so, which?<br />
<br />
Aaron wrinkled his nose at the list of options. Debate. Matholympians. Model UN. None of it really struck his fancy. And they asked if he wanted to try out, so obviously it wasn&#39;t required. So he simply wrote &#39;No&#39; and moved on.<br />
<br />
He looked up and around the room to the other young men and women. Everyone was filling out their forms now. Why did it feel strange to see a room full of people in their late teens to early twenties. Something was telling him that was very off from what it should be. Probably because they were in a high school and even the youngest looked college aged.  He met the gaze of another young man who smiled at him, Aaron grinned back before returning to the questionnaire.<br />
<br />
Would you like to apply to join any of the social clubs? If so, which?<br />
<br />
There was a whole list of clubs the school had on offer. He wondered how many people in this school. It was private, so probably a bit on the smaller side. There were about eighty sitting in this room, but that was no saying this was representative of a whole class.  Aaron still scanned his options for clubs and checked off two.  LGBT Student Alliance was an easy pick. It&#39;s why Aaron had no kids of his own anyway, hard to have a kid when women just didn&#39;t hold any interest for you. He always thought he could adopt if he met the right partner.. would adopt. He liked the idea of being a father someday, but he was much too young to be worried about that now. Why was he even thinking about having kids of his own? He had told his parents last year when he&#39;d figured out he was gay, they were super chill with it, too. Actually, they didn&#39;t seem all that surprised.<br />
<br />
He set his jaw in his hand as he looked over the list some more, not even marveling at the feeling of a smooth, clean jaw without even a hint of scruff or stubble. He also selected the Drama club. He always fancied following in his father&#39;s footsteps, this was a good way to see if he had the skill.<br />
<br />
Finding no more questions, Aaron set his pen down and stacked the sheets up neatly. As he waited he looked around at the others in the room., these would be his friends and classmates for the next four years after all, well, some of them. There were probably other groups to come. For a room full of fourteen year-olds everyone was pretty quiet and well behaved. And after middle school it was strange to see everyone in a uniform. All the boys in white button-ups with ties and black slacks. The girls in white blouses and black skirts.<br />
<br />
His eyes met the gaze of that one boy again, he had tousled black hair and a grin that promised mischief. He was also kind of cute. Aaron returned the grin, hoping it seemed friendly enough. Eventually everyone was finished and the librarian clapped her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. You can place your forms here in this box on your way out. Your parents will be waiting for you at the school entrance. Remember, the freshman class has their orientation assembly in two days at 8 am. You will be getting your class schedules and extracurricular information in first homeroom afterwards. I look forward to a productive four years with all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As with all large groups, it took a while for everyone to shuffle out. And since Aaron was one of the first to arrive he had been in the back of the room making him one of the last to leave. He caught sight of himself in a reflection in the windows and grinned.  A fit, fourteen year old, a bit on the taller side. Curly blond hair that probably could have used a trim and bright blue eyes. He was often told he was pretty good looking, and puberty was being kind to him so far. So why did he think he should be seeing a forty year old bear of a man, balding and gray-bearded with a bit of a gut? No one in his family looked like that..<br />
<br />
When he finally got out of the library after turning in his form he made his way to the entrance, only to feel a hand on his shoulder. It was the black haired kid, who held out a folded up piece of paper. &quot;Name&#39;s Jack. That&#39;s my number, text me. I think we, uh, might be good friends..&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron didn&#39;t get much chance to respond as the other kid ran off to a stunning raven-haired woman in her later thirties that was probably his mother. They were already talking as they headed off to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that, kiddo?&quot; Aaron looked up at the familiar voice. Something said he had never heard that voice before, but it was instantly familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Said his name was Jack. Guess he wants to be friends.&quot; Aaron shrugged and looked up at his father. He was always told he was the spitting image of his father and if that was true he was pretty lucky. Same blond hair, though his father kept it in a tight crew cut, that matched his trimmed blond beard. He was tall, and super athletic. Even pushing forty he was fit and muscular. But actors had to keep their bodies and looks in good shape. It was thanks to his career that his parents could afford such a prestigious private school for him to attend.<br />
<br />
He felt his father clap him on the shoulder. &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get home. Your mother will have a hundred questions.&quot; Aaron nodded and followed his dad to the car...</p>
