<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as I finished wishing I was blinded by a flash of bright light. When I opened my eyes again I saw my room exactly as it was before. Well, that wasn't a surprise as my wishes didn't affect anything in my room. So to see the effects my wishes had on the world I had to get some girl here.<br />
<br />
I crossed my fingers again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish my girlfriend would come and visit me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as I finished the sentence I heard the doorbell ring. My mom answered the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;JOOOSH!&quot; she shouted &quot;It's Jenny. She wants to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell her to come upstairs!&quot; I shouted back and waited sitting in my desk chair<br />
<br />
I heard steps and then a knock to my door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny didn't look any different herself and the only thing that could indicate that my wishes worked at all was what she was wearing. She wore a obviously too big T-shirt and yet I could clearly see her two nipples pointing at the fabric of her shirt. _Right, no more bras..._ I remembered. I couldn't see the outline of the breasts themselves but what I saw was enough for me to feel my dick getting harder. As she took a step in the points on her shirt started dancing around as if they were pinned to Jenny's chest with a set of springs and not with warm female flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Josh! I didn't have anything to do and I thought I may drop in. Are you doing anything interesting now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She approached my bed and clearly wanted to jump on it. What she did before jumping was intriguing - she pressed her forearm to her chest trying to hold her breasts and then she jumped. Apparently now even such a simple thing as jumping on a bed could cause too much movement a girl would want to experience. So far so good...<br />
She laid down on her back, her torso supported on her elbows. Her breasts visibly flattened although the two dancing points on her black T-shirt remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sooo...&quot; I started trying to hide a growing bulge in my pants &quot;How are your boobies? As annoying as always?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say as bad as always but today they're much worse. I was almost late for my bus and I had to run. You men can't even imagine how bad it can be. Or maybe you can. Well, two years of complaining following my Breastgiving definitely helps...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Breastgiving? What is that?&quot; I asked confused<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, the day I grew breasts. Everyone knows what it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well I didn't. I didn't have the memories from the altered reality. I turned to the window, crossed my fingers and quietly said that Jenny loves to speak about her Breastday no matter ho many times everyone heard that story already.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean...&quot; she started influenced by my reality alteration &quot;You know it's coming when your feet start to feel funny. Remember this one evening 2 years ago? We were both almost 14. I called you saying that I can't make myself to wear my slippers so it must be close. Nobody knows where the compulsion to walk barefoot comes from but well, that's the only warning one gets.<br />
The growing started when I was having my breakfast. It was Saturday, I remember. By 10 o'clock I already had my own set of boobs. The next day I already served my family cornflakes with my own milk... I felt proud and adult but also I finally understood what my mom meant when she said I'll be looking back to my breast-less times with a smile.<br />
God, they were uncomfortable... They still are, but the first couple of weeks is the worst. Firstly you've got to wait like a week for your feet to go back to normal, until then it's not even possible to wear socks. But that's a minor thing. The worst part is how your skin reacts. When the growth takes place the skin within 3 inches from one's nipples becomes slightly more elastic than normally so it can stretch as one's breasts grow. It's not particularly pleasant, I admit, but the real problem is the normal not-so-elastic skin. It needs more time to adapt to the newly introduced part of the anatomy and until it does a girl has to deal with her breasts tugging the skin around her neck and on her back whenever she, _they_, move.<br />
At least I was lucky enough to have my Breastgiving at a pretty standard age ending up with an average size. You know Alice Jakes? Her Breastgiving happened just six months after mine and her breasts are almost twice my size. Some girls have it even later... I mean my cousin is 18 and she still hasn't had hers. Now she can't find any job cause every employer knows that she'll be pretty much immobilized after she eventually gets her Breastgiving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah... That's interesting...&quot; I was genuinely impressed by the amount of detail each ring-induced reality shift caused. Even in someone's memories...<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what Jon? Such a silly thought I just had, such a silly idea! But it require magic to work... Sadly we're not in Hogwarts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you never know...&quot; I said smiling to myself &quot;There might be magic somewhere around us...&quot;<br />
<br />
That's when I made a huge mistake. Crossing my fingers I whispered that whatever Jenny would wish for in the next five minutes would become true. In fact, I even encouraged her to speak her mind out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's pretend that this... sock has some wish-granting powers.&quot; I took a sock from my drawer &quot;Go ahead and wish something aloud, maybe its sock-magic will make it come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
I winked to her and threw the the sock in Jenny's direction very gently but apparently throwing it was a really bad idea as she had to move fast to catch it. I could see from the expression in her face that it wasn't a particularly pleasant thing to do with breasts her size. Well, with breasts any size in this reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see Josh, you men never get how hard we get it. But soon you'll see... If only this magic sock thing is true I'm taking you for a little educational trip. So, firstly I'd wish that you couldn't interrupt me when I'm wishing because I don't think you'll like it what I want to say...&quot;<br />
<br />
That was the moment when I realized my great mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that for the next week I was a tall and handsome boy named Andrew spending his summer holidays somewhere nice and warm with his petite and cute girlfriend Annie, both of them our age of 16 years old. Obviously I wish Josh was spending the week as Annie. I wish that the first day of our vacations would happen to be Annie's Breastgiving day. Also, I wish that for the duration of our stay there I forgot completely how it feels to have breasts and the only way I thought about boobs is like most of the men do - consider them just as sexy toys I can't wait to play with...&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to protest but it was too late as a flash of bright light blinded us both...</p>
