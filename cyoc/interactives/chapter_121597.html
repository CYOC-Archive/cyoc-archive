<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jennifer started down the hall, her brother James rounded the corner and bumped into her full-force, almost knocking both of them down. As they both recovered, Jennifer rubbed her shoulder, which had taken the brunt of the impact. Luckily for James, he hadn&#39;t opened the wrapper containing the poptarts he was holding, and instead of a glass of milk, he had opted for a plastic carton. Otherwise, the collision would have been much messier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow, sorry sis---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry NOTHING! You little gamer dweeb! Watch where you&#39;re going! What, do you need glasses or something?&quot; As Jennifer gathered herself, glaring at her brother, things began to...shift. Every time Jennifer blinked, she could swear that James changed, but she couldn&#39;t figure out how. Perhaps she hit her head harder than she thought...<br />
<br />
James continued, &quot;I really am though! I&#39;m in a hurry--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a hurry to what? Beat off to some 3D girls? Don&#39;t you have to go to school or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
James looked at her quizzically, &quot;No, you know Tuesdays are my scrim days. Our highschool e-sports team has special permissions, remember?&quot; Jennifer blinked a few times, processing the information. She had vague memories of attending her brothers&#39; eSports tournaments over the years, how he&#39;d won prestige for the high-school they both attended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right. Well, make sure you don&#39;t feed too much, punk!&quot; She said with a sudden smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I&#39;m gonna Dew the team right!&quot; He made the lame pun, and she shot him an according glare, which he didn&#39;t notice while taking an emphatic chug of his milk-shifted-Mountain Dew. Jennifer hurriedly passed her brother, who returned to his room. She could hear the crinkle of a Doritos bag being opened from halfway down the stairs.<br />
<br />
As she reached the last step, she went over her mental &quot;To Do&quot; list before she walked out the door. Things like grabbing a drink, or other needed materials for the day. Something was bugging her though. As she racked her brain, she remembered that she fell asleep last night while playing her game, and probably hadn&#39;t saved it.<br />
<br />
{What if there&#39;s a power outage and I lose all that progress?} she thought, as she quickened her pace back up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Arriving back in her room, she flipped on the TV and checked her game. Even though she had managed to pause it before falling asleep, she wasn&#39;t anywhere near a save point. She sighed to herself, kicking off her shoes and sitting down. Sometimes in these types of games you couldn&#39;t tell how far it would be to the next save point.<br />
<br />
After a little time passed, she realized she probably wouldn&#39;t be able to make it to school today. She did the math in her head, and she could safely skip the day, as there weren&#39;t any tests or classes that would be that affected by her missing a day of assignments. Besides, she had more important matters to conquer.<br />
<br />
As she dug deeper and deeper into the game, she began to feel a little flustered. The main characters were two exaggeratedly voluptuous anime vixens, who clearly cared more about eachother than as &quot;Friends.&quot; One of their ultimate moves involved a dance where they rubbed the fronts of their bodies together. It was an amazing move, so of course Jennifer used it often. (Un)Fortunately, the cinematic dance had to play in its entirety before it was done, so Jennifer was spending a significant time, with her eyes being drawn ever-closer to the ample bosom of her heroes.<br />
<br />
She began to fantasize about what it would be like to be one of those characters, with a bust which dwarfed her own ample D&#39;s. How amazing it must felt, to perform such an intimate ritual with another feminine figure that understood your wants and needs?<br />
<br />
Every time the spell would occur, the controller would pulse with vibration. Jennifer was laying on her bed, hands holding the controller resting on her midsection. Every buzz began to feel hypnotic, as Jennifer watched time and time again as the perfect polygonal goddesses performed their ritual. Her face felt flushed, and she bit her lower lip, she began to feel a little moist, and as she was already skipping classes she had plenty of time to indulge.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t the first time Jennifer had felt this way over this game, which was probably one of the reasons it was among her favorites. In most circles she would defend the story and gameplay as being &quot;amazing,&quot; but her 18+ deviantArt account would beg to differ.<br />
<br />
Jennifer decided to shut off the game, and seek her stimulation where those that needed more than the official animations and comics would dare to venture. While she began pulling up images on her phone, she set her controller on &quot;vibration test,&quot; setting the power to a low rumble. She placed it on her tits as she began browsing google. With her right hand, she took off her skirt and slipped off her panties, shooting a quick glance at the door to make sure it was locked.<br />
<br />
As she found the right collage of images, she began actively rubbing her left breast with the controller, and nudged up the power by a notch. This alone was enough to elicit a gush of pleasure from her already dripping cunt. As she continued massaging her breasts and fantasizing about the virtual vixens, her controller hand wandered south. She began rubbing her slit with the phallic grip of the controller, and nudged up the power another few notches. She might have been worried about ruining the controller with her juices, but she had a few spares in the closet just in case she had company over.<br />
<br />
As she cranked it up the final notch, she began inserting the grip into the slick entrance that had become ready. As it buzzed away happily, she began riding the combo of pleasure she was building. She kept trying to look at her phone, but the waves of pleasure kept relaxing different parts of her body, and she became a quivering mess of controller vibration and orgasm, giving a quiet squeak as she came all over the carpet in front of her system. <br />
<br />
Her eyes grew wide, as she jumped off her bed to make sure she hadn&#39;t gotten anything on her game system. Luckily for her, it seemed that she&#39;d only reached half-way, even though there would be a little bit of clean-up required before she got back to her gaming session.</p>
