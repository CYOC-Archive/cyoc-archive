<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake went into the changing room and put on the over sized speedos.<br />
<br />
As he looked at himself in the mirror he noticed that his face was looking rounder. <br />
<br />
His less than muscular chest was becoming full fledged man boobs.<br />
<br />
His thighs began to rub each other.<br />
<br />
His arms became thicker at his biceps than he waist had once been and his belly lurched out in front of him <br />
hiding any hint of the speedo from the front. <br />
<br />
Jake turned around to see his ass had ballooned and the speedo began to fish it's way up his ass crack making <br />
it look somewhat like a thong.<br />
<br />
As Jake sat down to take off the speedo he had a hard time reaching around and removing the over sized speedo.<br />
<br />
He stood up naked and looked at himself in the mirror. But no changes happened.<br />
<br />
A scream erupted from his throat followed by the owner asked if there was anything he could do.<br />
<br />
What the hell did you do to me?<br />
<br />
You did it. The owner said. This was your choice not mine.<br />
<br />
Change me back.<br />
<br />
I can do it but it will take some time and some money.<br />
<br />
HOW MUCH? $10,000.<br />
<br />
I don't have that much money.<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
Thanks for shopping at the second hand store.<br />
<br />
Jake put the speedos on and grabbed his old clothes and went to the counter.<br />
<br />
I'll get the money but change me back so I can get it for you.<br />
<br />
Oh I couldn't do that. If I changed you back why would you pay me my fee.<br />
<br />
Please. Jake pleaded with the owner.<br />
<br />
Jake and the owner talked for over half an hour and Jake realized there was no reasoning with him so he <br />
grabbed his clothes and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way those will be $500.<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
Those speedos.<br />
<br />
You change me into this fat tub of lard and then charge me for it.<br />
<br />
Hey I am a business man I got to earn a living.<br />
<br />
Jake took out his debit card and swiped it taking out all the money from his account except a few dollars.<br />
<br />
How could he live like this.<br />
<br />
Jake made his way home and called his best friend Tony.<br />
<br />
Look what he did to me. Jake said sobbing.<br />
<br />
Damn your fat. How much do you weigh.<br />
<br />
I don't know I feel huge though.<br />
<br />
You are huge dude.<br />
<br />
Could you get me some clothes.<br />
<br />
I guess but what size should I get.<br />
<br />
The found a tape measure and started around Jake's mid section. Ok that looks like 80 inches give or take. <br />
They had to move the tape measure a couple times and weren't exactly sure if they had started and ended at the <br />
same place but it was close. Inseam was 30 inches. Tony had to work his hand up in between his chubby legs.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what size shirt to get so I will guess.<br />
<br />
Tony headed off to a fat man's store and got several pairs of slacks and several size shirts to 5xl.<br />
<br />
As he got home they dressed Jake. First with the pants working them up those chubby legs and between his <br />
thighs.<br />
<br />
They tried on the 3xl and it had no chance of fitting. Then the 4xl and it was closer but still there were <br />
several buttons at his belly that wouldn't hit. The 5xl all buttoned but they were straining and there was <br />
some belly showing through.<br />
<br />
There Tony said. <br />
<br />
Jake sat and became depressed.<br />
<br />
Look guy you need to earn that money.<br />
<br />
I know but how am I going to do it. In this body I am so hungry and what can I do to earn that kind of money <br />
it will take forever.<br />
<br />
Then you need to get started.<br />
<br />
Jake headed off to work and tried to explain to his boss that he had a reaction to a vaccine and he blew up <br />
like a balloon.<br />
<br />
This is a physical job you can't do this kind of work his boss said.<br />
<br />
Look you lose the weight and come back and your job will be here but I am going to have to lay you off.<br />
<br />
Jake was even more depressed and found himself turning into a bar. He hadn't seen what sort of bar it was but <br />
he sat at the bar and ordered a beer when someone came up behind him and said hey sexy.<br />
<br />
The voice was somewhat rough and he looked up and saw a big furry man.<br />
<br />
Why so down.<br />
<br />
Oh you wouldn't understand. He said.<br />
<br />
I might why don't you tell me. He said to Jake still standing behind him.<br />
<br />
Jake looked at his reflection and told the complete stranger that he had gained all this weight recently and <br />
just lost his job because he was so over weight and didn't know how he was going to be able to pay his debt. <br />
He didn't tell him about the second hand store. He didn't think he would believe him anyway.<br />
<br />
Well big guy we need some dancers.<br />
<br />
Yea right. Look at me I am not a good person for a dancer.<br />
<br />
You would be surprised what my patrons like.<br />
<br />
Jake thought what did he have to lose. He had stuck the speedo in his pocket before he left and followed the <br />
guy to the back room and put on the speedo.<br />
<br />
Damn that looks good the guy said and shoved Jake out the drapes where there were a few guys that hooted and <br />
hollered at him.<br />
<br />
Jake just stood and looked at them for a bit and then shook himself a bit here and there getting even more cat <br />
calls.<br />
<br />
As Jake moved more and got closer to the men watching him he found if he turned around and shook his butt he <br />
would get felt up and something would be slipped into his speedo.<br />
<br />
Jake danced for 15 minutes and came off the stage with a couple hundred dollars in singles.<br />
<br />
He danced the rest of the night and made a grand easy.<br />
<br />
He stopped off at a late night greasy spoon and ordered the biggest meal he had ever seen let alone eaten <br />
ever.<br />
<br />
Night after night he swung his ass at the horny men. Going home with a few and even went to bed with the owner <br />
a couple times when he made the $10,000. <br />
<br />
Jake ran down to the second hand store and gave him the money. Now change me back.<br />
<br />
It will take some time to change you back.<br />
<br />
Going fat is easier than going back.<br />
<br />
How long.<br />
<br />
Depends on your resolve. Looks like you are bigger than when you left here. If you keep eating like this you <br />
aren't ever going to get back but you can lose it all.<br />
<br />
Give me back my money.<br />
<br />
Oh so you want to be like this forever.<br />
<br />
If your not going to change me back I want my money back.<br />
<br />
If you don't pay me you will not only be this way forever but be bigger.<br />
<br />
Jake left the money with the man in the hopes that he would lose the weight and went off to work.<br />
<br />
The owner just deposited the money knowing that there was no way Jake would ever be able to lose the weight.</p>
