<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Baxter only just managed to keep himself under control, telling himself he was edging, that this was just building him up for the date later with that hottie on Tinder. He finally managed to push his hand to the side, away from his aching, erect manhood, and then just for good measure turned the water from hot to cold, and let out an anguished gasp as he felt the cold water do its work. His manhood calmed under the cold auspices of the shower, and Baxter shivered a bit, standing there as he washed off the hot sweat from his body. He didn&#39;t know why he was suddenly so turned on, but he knew it had felt damn good doing that.<br />
<br />
As Baxter got out of the shower and dried off with his towel, he looked in the mirror and noticed that, beyond his arms, his body lacked hair sans the hair on the top of his head, which seemed subtly more luscious and pretty than usual. He ran a hand through it and grinned a little at how soft and good it felt to his finger tips. And looking back at his ass, he noted the one muscle group that seemed to be his weakness was now more prominent, muscular and tight.<br />
<br />
Baxter gave it a good hard slap, and shivered as his cock once again went ramrod erect just from that momentarily blip of contact. Baxter wiped off his face and barely noticed that his lips seemed puffier somehow. Like they were more eminently kissable. And he noticed that as he left the bathroom that he was feeling pretty hungry.<br />
<br />
Deciding to go get himself some food from the local department store just down the block from his pad, Baxter got his shoes on and headed out. He still had a lot of time before his date, and he didn&#39;t want his stomach to start acting up when he and Jen got hot and heavy. Baxter veritably swaggered out on to the street in his tight jeans, short sleeved shirt tight fit to his shoulders and arms, and a light jacket. He noticed with some glee that the local hotties as usual noticed him...<br />
<br />
...and he noticed them with a different light than he usually did.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;d it feel like?&quot; Baxter found himself pondering as he walked, &quot;If I had boobs like they did? Could I still be a bodybuilder stud and---heh, I&#39;d always have a rack to feel up...&quot; He just chalked it up to his usual libido and kept going. But the thoughts did not stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have such amazing skin and hair. Fuck, I need to work on my hair a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has such great lipstick...would I look good with lipstick on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her make up makes her look great...how&#39;d it look on me though?&quot;<br />
<br />
Baxter just tried to shake it off and headed into the department store. He immediately recognized the guy behind the counter as RJ, a dude he&#39;d known back in high school. RJ had been one of the nerdier guys while Baxter had been a top stud even then - and nowadays it seemed the nerd had picked up some weights in the intervening time. RJ now had swollen, strong biceps, boulder shoulders, and prominent, strong pecs. His wide back and lats gave him an impressive appearance even in the store uniform shirt he had to wear...though the slightly protruding abdominals told him that not all of RJ&#39;s mass was natty obtained.<br />
<br />
The nerd had been a dark haired guy back in high school, and now it seemed he&#39;d taken to dyeing his hair peroxide blond. It...looked surprisingly good on him. In fact Baxter was rather surprised he found the newly strong features of RJ so appealing. He just could not quite stop himself from looking over the former nerd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baxter...Baxter...dude, is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was jarred out of it by RJ heading over from his duties stocking the shelves and making sure things were in order, and apparently recognizing him too. &quot;Oh yeah...yeah man, it&#39;s me. Damn dude...&quot; Baxter started and barely managed to stop himself from ogling the nerd yet again, &quot;You really put on some size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw how ripped you were in high school, bro,&quot; RJ stated, and flexed an arm, &quot;Wanted to be just like you. Replete with all the girls and stuff.&quot; RJ&#39;s arm really drew Baxter&#39;s eye, and the nerd seemed to notice this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, are you checking me out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah bro, just looking at your hard work.&quot; Baxter quickly responded, and then looked around, checking if RJ&#39;s bosses were around or particularly eagle-eyed to their employee chatting like this. &quot;How&#39;s life been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know,&quot; RJ shrugged his huge shoulders, &quot;Been seeing this girl from college. Arlene. She&#39;s amazing. So fucking hot. We met during a health class. And she hasn&#39;t been able to keep her hands off ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
Baxter nodded, going over and clasping RJ&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You&#39;ve really made it bro. Damn, never would&#39;ve seen this coming. Dude, we have got to work out some time.&quot; Baxter found himself getting curiously excited by the idea, and much as he knew he was into girls, something in Baxter right now was making him just feel so hot for his old schoolmate.<br />
<br />
His nipples felt hard and erect in his shirt, and he was sweating all of a sudden. He couldn&#39;t stop himself from grinning like a fool as he and RJ inhabited such close spaces. Baxter couldn&#39;t well stop himself due to how good this all felt, and there was also the question of if he even wanted to stop himself.<br />
<br />
RJ finally just brought it to a head, looking at Baxter seriously now, &quot;Dude, be honest with me. You&#39;re springing wood on me so much the front of your jeans is pushing out. You wanna fool around with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Baxter was by now feeling somewhat delirious from how good this all felt, &quot;But...you&#39;re...you have like, a girlfriend, bro...you&#39;re---we&#39;re straight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; RJ said, &quot;You want this or not?&quot;</p>
