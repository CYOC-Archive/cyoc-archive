<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They were only getting warmed up but they knew in their hearts they had to give it everything they they could, anything would be dishonest to <br />
both themselves and their Master. It didn’t matter if their Master didn’t know, they knew - and with their new transformed psychologies they <br />
could not hide anything from their Master - he knew his pup’s better than they knew themselves. <br />
<br />
Both Patrick and Angus started to their warm up exercises - at least 100 pull ups and and 150 triceps dips. It was arms day and by god they <br />
were going to feel it.<br />
<br />
Angus with the tremendous weight hanging from his balls waddled with a wide up to the parallel bars. Dragging behind him at a total of nine <br />
feet and with a total of 1100 pounds, 800 pounds of weight and 300 of their own sheer weight alone. He took careful step after careful as he <br />
climbed up by step up the rungs of the ladder. Angus took a deep breath and placed a grip on both of the handles, pushing himself off the <br />
rung he was standing on he let his full weight hang down, the effect of gravity only being counteracted by Angus’s massive biceps.<br />
<br />
He felt his workout drink come into full effect, feeling power surge up through his body. It was a special drugs of testosterone, caffeine, <br />
creatine and other performing enhancing drugs. He felt truly electric. In one part of his brain he felt he was capable of anything, another part of <br />
his brain screamed to him that only in service might he be powerful and he had a long long way to go until he reached his full potential.<br />
<br />
“88... 89...90”  He grunted under his breath. As lifted himself up and down his pendulous balls made contact with the ground, it was only after <br />
hearing the “kurchunk” below him that he knew he had descended deep enough and could come back up again. “91... 92”. He lifted his entire <br />
force bringing his fuzzy beachball belly up and down. <br />
<br />
As he continued his exercises he started to sweat, his sweaty musk radiating and filling the special reinforced gym with the thick heady musky <br />
fragrance of ginger. None of Dan’s pups could wear deodorant - ever. Their fragrance was something that was never to be subdued, as long as <br />
his pups were clean Dan was happy.<br />
<br />
He reached the full one hundred, he was feeling sore but he was no where needed to be, he had to give more. His biceps inflated in response to <br />
the stress they were under, it looked like cannonballs has been stretched skin, it veins stuck protruded like wires trying to get as much blood <br />
to his body as possible. He had to give more, he needed to give more. He needed to prove himself worthy of his place within the family, he had <br />
show his Master with deed and not words how much he loved him. He was struggling, almost in tears as he pulled himself up for the one <br />
hundred and forty second time. He wanted to give so much more but he had reached his physical limit, the lactic acid burned like a fire in his <br />
biceps. <br />
<br />
Very carefully he swung himself around to position himself for tricep dips, if he did it too quickly, his pendulous balls could twist about.<br />
<br />
Dan walked into the gym, he wanted to see his pups as they did their exercises. The first thing he notices as he walked into the gym was just <br />
how humid it was, it was like a sauna. The entire place was saturated with the smell of ginger sweat. Instantly Dan got a hard-on, filling his <br />
shorts. Usually he would wear a jockstrap but in this world freeballing sent a statement - it was a statement both of freedom and dominance. <br />
Even with his modest sized cock he noticed that it was barely covered by his shorts, having a habit of slipping out when he was careless, <br />
drawing the attention of other subs. Secretly in his heart he wanted to be craved by legions every ginger in this world, it took him quite a lot of <br />
strength not to collar more gingers who had thrown themselves upon Dan’s feet begging to be taken into their family. He decided against it, <br />
even the three he had were already handful.<br />
<br />
Their heady ginger smell instantly put Dan into his dominant headspace. His cock throbbed, pushing up against the side of his thigh and up <br />
past his his waistband, dripping out globs of precum onto his singlet. He wanted his pups more than he could ever describe. He craved to be <br />
worshiped, he needed his pups to treat them like their god. He was their Master’s world, the reason why they lived, their very purpose for <br />
being. <br />
<br />
The two gingers were hard at work doing their exercises. Angus was laying the back of a reinforced bench doing skull crushers and Patrick was <br />
doing preacher curls.  The two had long ago abandoned what they were wearing, becoming already soaked through with sweat. Fortunately, <br />
much like every establishment in this world it was clothing optional, as long as the gingers laid down their towels before they worked out they <br />
were okay. <br />
<br />
Dan didn’t even have to call out for his pup’s any more. Almost instinctually, the two pup’s caught onto their Master’s scent. It was a minute <br />
smell within the room but they knew instantaneously that their Master had arrived. It was the smell they were trained to adore, the smell they <br />
were trained to crave every moment of every day.<br />
<br />
The two dropped their weights as they made their way over to their Master as quickly as they could, Patrick lumbering under his own massive <br />
weight and Angus dragging his heavily weighted balls behind them. The two of them instantly got onto their knees and kissed their Master’s <br />
feet, whimpering. His pups were on all fours with their cocks and balls hanging heavily on the floor behind them. As they gave their devotions <br />
their balls inflated visably at at two inches a every 30 seconds, a combination of the energy from their workouts and their devotion to their <br />
Master had put their sex drives into hyperdrive.<br />
<br />
The pressure built up for both of them, they could not come, only Master could tell them when they could come. The more the pressure grew <br />
the more they whimpered and the deeper into their subspace they descended. They needed their Master more than anything in the world. Their <br />
whimpering grew louder.<br />
<br />
They kissed, they licked and they nuzzled. They tried to find the words to describe how they felt but their minds felt clouded over, developing <br />
higher thoughts was all but impossible, their drive to serve came from a deeper, more primal part of their brains. They weren’t thinking, they <br />
were following the commands which had been written into their very beings, it was impossible to resist, impossible to disobey. Dan’s power <br />
over his pups was absolute and total. <br />
<br />
Master grew even more turned on at this display of their obvious discomfort as their testicles grew larger and larger in size, yet they continued <br />
to worship. He took a moment of their pup’s display of devotion and obedience and appreciated it. The the thing that he loved besides the <br />
whimpering, was seeing both of his pups with their asses high in their air, trying as best as they could reduce themselves to the level necessary <br />
to kiss their Master’s feet, which considering their massive bellies was a difficult tasks. Their beards ticked Dan as they worked their magic. His <br />
pups with their firm and huge meaty arses with their brands - for the whole world to see. Before slipping completely into his dom space Dan <br />
remembered why he had come in the first place.<br />
<br />
“Angus. Patrick. Upright for inspection” he called out.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation his pups went upright. Both of them tried to reach their “at-attention” positions but the mass of their arms prevented them <br />
from holding their arms behind, the best they could do is hold their arms at their sides and keep their heads down - neither Patrick or Angus <br />
could look at their Master directly, neither of them felt that they had earned that privilege. They never would.<br />
<br />
Even on their knees, his pup’s came up to Dan’s eye level. Side by side the two comprised a wall of human meat, with their lats and chests <br />
pushed out.<br />
<br />
The first thing Dan noticed with Angus at attention was how much bigger his stomach had seemed from the last time he had seen it, an extra <br />
two feet of firm ball belly jutting out from him. He hadn’t made any adjustments on the chonovac, something was up.<br />
<br />
“Angus, have you been holding in your stomach in?” Dan asked. Angus nodded, still not making eye contact, he gave out a little regretful <br />
squeak. “You do realise that is lying Angus, you should never lie to your Master.” It took Dan a concerted effort to retain his composure being <br />
forceful at his time, seeing Angus with his big belly sticking out with his huge ballooning pecs topped off with meaty pointy nipples was one of <br />
the sexiest things he had ever seen, he was very proud of his pup, but lying is lying and lying must be punished.<br />
<br />
Juxtaposing his massive size, little squeaky whimpers escaped from his throat. Droplets of tears fell from his downturned face and rolled down <br />
his already wet with sweat belly.<br />
<br />
“Angus. As punishment, I want you to raise your head and look at yourself in the mirror and I mean really look at yourself. You are not to look <br />
away until I give you the order”<br />
<br />
Angus did just that. He lifted his heavy head and saw how he saw himself in his minds eye. He saw him himself small and pathetic, disheveled <br />
and atrophied. He had no muscles, his red hair and his collar were all gone, all the features his Master loved had vanished. All he could see in <br />
himself was disappointment, he had so far to progress, so much further to go. The image burned in his mind, upsetting him greatly. He had to <br />
push harder, he had to push longer. He felt so unworthy of his Master’s love. How could Master love someone as small and pathetic as he?  His <br />
vision of himself of the mirror blurred as more tears filled his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Now Angus, what must you never do?”<br />
<br />
“I must never lie to my Master!” he called out.<br />
<br />
“And what you must do now?”<br />
<br />
“I must make myself better for my Master!” Angus cried.<br />
<br />
“Very good. Now get yourself off your knees and get back to your workout. When you do your exercises, I want you to keep looking at the <br />
mirror and think about what you’ve done”. Without protest or hesitation, he whimpered and made his way back to the bench and added another <br />
400lbs to his skull crushers..<br />
<br />
That left Dan with Patrick, who through the entire thing had kept his head down. Dan stepped up closer to Patrick. “Well, it looks like I have one <br />
good pup and one bad pup... are you a good pup?”. Patrick nodded. Dan put his hands on Patrick’s chest and pressed down, his chest had no <br />
give, they were two orbs of pure muscle. Patrick’s cock was inflating behind him, oozing out precum like a faucet on low, his balls continued to <br />
inflate larger and larger, usually the size of basketballs now the size of yoga balls - the sensations of having his Master touch him was puting <br />
Patrick into sensory overload. Sounds emitted from Patrick that were a cross between a whimper and a moan of pleasure. He know he shouldn’t <br />
feel such pleasure, but he couldn’t help himself.<br />
<br />
Dan rubbed his hands through Patrick's luxurious red pelt of chest hair eventually finding his way to Patrick’s pierced nipple. Dan knew that <br />
Patrick was enjoying this, they had been trained to long for even the slightest touch. He knew there was nothing Patrick could do, that was <br />
completely immobilised, both a slave to his own submission and his own sensations. It was such an intoxicating he had in his hands. Dan’s <br />
cock was painfully hard but he was only just beginning. He was working up to a crescendo and this was just the opening number.  He rubbed <br />
the nipple slowly, flicking it gently, fiddling around with the ring, giving the the ring a bit of a tug.<br />
<br />
Dan noticed that Patrick’s cock was starting to turn purple with all of the pressure, reaching it’s full length of six and a half feet in length and <br />
width of a telephone pole. At it’s end the massive prince albert glistened by the precum that was gushing out and creating a pool that was <br />
spreading across the floor.<br />
 <br />
Dan felt Patrick’s bicep, his gigantic, steroidal, veiny biceps. He pressed down it it, the muscle haad absolutely no give. It must have been at <br />
least 35 inches around! With biceps like that it would certainly cause a few issues, but Dan didn’t care. With a biceps and a chest like this he <br />
could bench press a truck - and Patrick is what you would call consider small for a ginger!... but not for long.<br />
<br />
He gave Patrick’s nipple a hard twist. Gasping, Patrick lifted his head up towards his Master. Taking the opportunity he grabbed onto his pup’s <br />
braided beard hard and forced his pup closer to him. With a heavy anticipation Master, locked lips with his pup, with one hand he held the <br />
beard, with the other he held his nipples. Pup welcomed his Master into his mouth, savoring taste of his wonderful salva, letting his tongue <br />
explored his mouth, feeling his Master’s soft lips against his own. Patrick was weeping from feeling such profound things from his Master.<br />
<br />
Dan pulled himself away from his pup slightly and liked a tear as it streaked down his face. To Dan in his Dom space, the salty tear tasted <br />
pretty damn sweet. <br />
<br />
Dan couldn’t help himself, he moved Patrick’s head over to one side and bit down onto it. He bit down harder than he ever had before. Patrick <br />
gasped and whimpered with both pain and pleasure. Dan sucked harder, he wanted his pup’s bruises to be red and black. Pup was winced as <br />
he felt the most intense and painful feelings of blue balls he had ever felt, he felt that the cum was literally churning inside his immense <br />
testicles, each growing now to the size of a beanbag chair with his sack growing longer to accommodate them. He could not cum, he could not <br />
allow him to.<br />
<br />
Letting go of his pup’s neck he observed with satisfaction the bruise that he had left. With a bruise like that he would surely be the envy of all <br />
the other gingers at this gym. Infact he should be the envy of all gingers period. Despite the pain Patrick was experience, he was actually <br />
blushing, somewhere amidst all the explosion of sensation was and underriding profound love and gratitude. <br />
<br />
God, Dan loved his pup’s so much, but he always knew that Patrick was the most special. Patrick would do anything for his Master, no matter <br />
what he would always be there for Dan. If Dan were to ever leave, he would be sure that Patrick’s mind and body would shut down.<br />
<br />
He had a very special purpose for his special pup now. Dan’s already painfully hard and oozing cock stiffened and lengthened even further. He <br />
followed Patrick’s eyes, looking at his Master’s cock. He wanted it like a hungry animal. <br />
<br />
Dan removed his modest cock from his shorts, having to use two hands to bring his cock and balls out of their fabric prison. His cock standing <br />
proud and rigid outwardly from his body.<br />
<br />
Getting close to his pup, he moved his hips from side to side, waving his cock under his pup’s nose making sure he his could smell it. Pup <br />
whimpered but he stayed diciplined and strock. Dan lightly brushed his cock cross his pup’s face leaving a streak of precum across his beard <br />
and face. Patrick was salivating.<br />
<br />
“You want this don’t you?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
Patrick nodded whimpering.<br />
<br />
“You would do it anything for my cock wouldn’t you? It’s the totem of your worship, it fills you much pleasure to give me pleasure?”<br />
<br />
The bull nodded again. He raised his head, his eyes were wide and big. Master could tell just from his eyes how much it meant to him.<br />
<br />
“Well, he’s going to get it alright. He’ll be getting a whole lot more than he bargained for. To do anything else would be cruel” Dan thought.<br />
<br />
“Stay exactly where you are Patrick” the Master ordered.</p>
