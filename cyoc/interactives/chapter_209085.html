<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After giving much thought, Katie decided to age herself to Kellie’s age.  While being a kid at ten is fun, being an adult a hundred times more.  After all, she can do things she would never done at the age she currently is.  Plus, it’s at that age that she can do things she heard from with the other kids.  Things that could be a bit…  Provocative.<br />
<br />
With that confidence, she looked to her ring, closed her eyes, and made her wish in her head.<br />
<br />
“I wish that I age up to twenty five, both physically and mentally.  I wish that my clothes will alter to fit my age.  I wish that reality would alter to fit my age.  And I wish that my bond with Kellie, my mom, will be strong and we’ll be loving twin siblings at the hip.”<br />
<br />
Once she made this wish and demands, the ring started to glow and started the changes.  Of course, the changes were slow as it will take one car ride to the beach.  This would give Katie a chance to see herself change and how the bond with Kellie would become.  Feeling the tingle, she knew the changes have started.<br />
<br />
As the warmth began in her body, Katie felt her swimsuit shifting and becoming smaller on a steadily growing body.  Her arms and legs came first, growing out, long and gangly like the legs of a colt.  Her fingers and toes became thinner, more distinct and dainty as the nails themselves became painted pink polish.  She giggled and swung her legs and watched with fascination as her toes drifted further and further to the floor of the carpet, until the balls of her feet touched...then the flats, then the heels.  She sighed in elation and realization that she was growing up, finally able to touch her feet to the floor of most places at last, though a part of her somehow wished she could swing her legs at times.<br />
<br />
The coltish appearance stopped there though as she experienced something strange.  Her hips began to push out, just a little bit at a time, gaining a slight curve, at the same time her legs and arms gained a distinct tone to them as if she&#39;d spent every day running, playing and moving.  Her stomach gurgled as it also flattened and toned nicely, and she could watch the change as it spread along her bare belly and along her belly button, leaving her abdomen neatly pretty like she&#39;d seen girls who entered surfing competitions.  The skin of the changed areas began to gain a natural and nice tan as she criss crossed her legs to see the pigment slowly change.<br />
<br />
By now her bathing bottom had stretched beyond its limit and she felt a new strange tingling beneath it.  She felt a warmth as within her insides her body began to approach the age of adolescence.  She could not see the changes, but she distinctly felt them, letting out a little gasp as new thoughts and understands began to grow in her young preteen mind.<br />
<br />
At the same time her flat tank top would begin to swell with the growth of two small mounds beneath it, the same warmth below filling them as she began to develop...her eyes widening now as she understood what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m....entering puberty...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought excited and terrified her and the changes weren’t done.  She could see her face in the rearview mirror as the cute, childlike features began to define.  Her button nose was still that, but it was starting to even out.  The freckles on her face were less prevalent and her teeth rearranged as some adult ones grew in.  She gained a certain maturity, a certain beginning of beauty as her hair began to flow long to her back and around her newly pierced ears.  A prick and pain and looking down she found herself in possession of a third new one in her belly button, as if it has always been there.  Finally her suit expanded and changed, becoming a floral print bikini for a girl like her age.  Old, beat up and well loved converse sneakers tied themselves haphazardly to her feet and a small child sized surfboard appeared next to her.<br />
<br />
Seeing that surfboard, she wondered why it immediately appeared.  That’s when the mental changes kicked in.  She remembered that starting in her preteens; she started to enter into her athletic phases as she was starting to work out and took part in sports such as baseball, soccer, and karate.  But close to the beach, she was more of a swimmer and wanted to start surfing.  So it was obvious that the surfboard appeared in front of her.  Cause she was just starting to surf.<br />
<br />
“Hey Pre-Tweeb!”<br />
<br />
Katie could hear her now sister calling her out and turned to her to see her a little aggravated.<br />
<br />
“Be lucky I was able to take you to the beach to do surfing practice on my day off.  Because I work full time as a lawyer, don’t expect me to take you down there.” Kellie said to her.<br />
<br />
Katie heard her and knew what she meant.  Back when she was a mother, she was a professional Attorney with a lot of successful cases under her belt.  But with that much work load means that she rarely had the time to spend with her daughter.  Now at twenty five, she was nothing more than an apprentice with certain free days on a weekend, following older and more professional lawyers to learn from their craft.  Katie was amazed that she was still like that before going full blown attorney.  Maybe if she can age her down a few pegs, she can be more fun.  But for now, she would rather stick with being twins to see how it will play out.<br />
<br />
Katie soon felt another tingle as she started to ascend into her teen years.  She could feel another growth spurt coming as her height jumped to three to four inches.  But she could see other changes on her body that takes her straight to womanhood.  The small mounds on her chest started to grow as they look like pointy cones.  Katie saw them sticking out and could feel her hormones ramping up as the nipples started to look erect.  Her hips started to flare up a bit and were gaining a bit of curves around her waist.  Her arms and legs stretched as her skin was toning up and darkening in a glazed like tan.  Looking to her review mirror, she could see her face maturing as she was entering her teens.  Her head was shaping from a round to oval, her nose grew bigger and thinner, the freckles continue to fade bit by bit, and her eyes were getting smaller and more mature.  She flinged a few blonde strands back as her hair slowly grew down her neck.  Looking down at her feet, she could see her worn out sneakers looking new again and adjusted size to fit her growing feet.  The thirteen-year-old was enjoying this as she was starting to grow out into her teen years.<br />
<br />
“Urgh…  This music is so boring.” Kellie said as the elevator music was aggravating her she was listing to since she started driving.  She started to change the station and picked up a pop channel that had an upbeat.  “There…  That’s much better.” She said in pure enjoyment, “I swear if I hear another antique song again I’m going to tear my ears off.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard that and was quite surprise.  Turning to her, she told her, “But I thought you like listening to that type of music.  It’s your favorite.”<br />
<br />
Kellie brushed it off and said, “Oh please…  You expect me to listen to tunes that granny listen to?  No thank you.  After all, these tunes are the best yet.  Perhaps you want to listen to the old folk’s music, Tweeb.”<br />
<br />
Katie was taken back by the new name Kel given her and turned feeling a little embarrassed.  “Um…  No thanks…  I’m good.”  Katie could tell that reality was working its way around her aging.  The same can be said with Kellie as her body language and tastes were altering to match her growing daughter/sister.  She wondered what else would change if she continued to grow to her designated age.  Well, Katie wouldn’t wait any longer as she going feel another tingle coming up.<br />
<br />
She could feel her body growing again as she could feel another growth spurt happening, shooting up another couple of inches.  Her body then continued to mature further as her cones upgraded to size A cups, small but round.  She could feel her hips expanding as her waist gotten a little curvier than normal.  Tracing her finger to her hourglass, she was amazed at how shapely she’s becoming.  She then spotted her fingernails and noticed that they were extending while her hands grew big and dainty.  She could even see the nail polish on her nails as the pink began to sparkle.  She looked at the polish as the sparkle reflected on the shine, feeling amazed by it all.  She then started to stretch as her muscles beginning to strain, as she could feel the tone of her muscles improving after years of working out and surfing competition.  She checked her face again and could see its journey through adulthood.  Face looking so much oval like, nose getting longer and thinner a faint freckling on her nose, and eyes smaller and less childlike.  She also noticed her lips puffing with cartilage and darkening to give her something to be kissed with.  Her hair started to grow longer as it brushed past her shoulders and was getting brighter by the second.  Her floral print bikini shifted to match her body as it changed into something more mature at the floral designed faded and replaced with a navy blue color.  Her sneakers shifted a little more as the laces vanished and the top opened up a little, turning into teenage flip-flops.  Then her surfboard grew a little to match her age and looked like ones for teenagers.  Katie watches it all as the 14-year-old stretched a little, enjoying her changes bit by bit.<br />
<br />
As she was looking at Kellie, she notices something else off. For one, the car looked a little different.  Sure, she was driving a Honda Civic, a typical mom’s car, but it looked like it was shifting a bit, looking sleeker and more powerful. Seeing that, Katie asked Kellie, “Hey, Kel?  Did you notice that the car is looking a bit differently than normal?”<br />
<br />
Kellie gave a shrug and said back, “Huh?  No…  I don’t think there’s anything different.  I just gave it a bit of a tune up and it runs smoothly.”  Looking at the steering wheel, she gave a sigh and continued with, “Still..,.  I just wish we go to the beach in a sick ride then this piece of rust bucket.  I swear, this Civic is a typical Soccer Mom car and I’m not a mom!  Can’t you believe this?”<br />
<br />
Katie could tell that between the car and the surfboard, that reality is altering to match her growth.  “Yeah…  Strange huh?” she covered up.  She looked away and could tell that she was behaving like a little sister then a daughter.  Which makes sense since her own mother is behaving like an older sister.  Soon the dynamic would change once the two becomes twins and maybe Kellie could be nicer than this.  That will soon come as she felt for tingles happening and her body was ascending through teen hood.<br />
<br />
She now felt her body growing more pronounced as she raced through the teen years.  Her growth spurt got to a couple of more inches and she could feel like she was rising on the elevator.  Her chest started to feel heavy as she looks down to see the mounds growing bigger and looking like AAs.  Hips widening and curving as she had the hourglass of a young teen.  Katie crossed her legs as she could feel them growing longer and shapelier, letting her free foot dangling as she moved her dainty foot to the beat.  Her legs took the same direction as well and grew longer with muscles swelling to young surf girl status.  Her skin darkened a little more of a golden color as she looked to her hand to see it changing shape with fingers getting thinner and longer and her nails extending further.  Katie decided to look at the dashboard mirror and see if the face has changed much.  So far, she could see it maturing more, as her cheeks look less puffy, her nose thinning to a sleeker shape, lips puffy a little bit, and her eyes and ears growing smaller.  Starring at herself, she was starting to look like such a beauty.  Just as she was looking at herself, she could feel a little discomfort in her mouth.  Opening her mouth, she noticed braces appearing on her teeth.  Katie was surprised by that and wondered how that got there.  That’s when she remembered her memories altering.  She remembered that she needed braces to help straighten her teeth. That could explain why she had them in the first place.  She then noticed the skin on his face as saw a little dot on the cheek.  Was that a pimple?  She heard of teen girls getting them, but she never thought it was possible for her.  Guess it was a price to pay when growing up.<br />
<br />
“Looking at yourself, sis?” Katie looked to Kellie who stopped at a traffic light and got a good look at her.  “Still feeling worried about your looks?”<br />
<br />
Katie felt a little nervous and said, “Yeah…  The braces hurt and I swear I could see a zit on my face.  I feel embarrassed going to the beach looking like this.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gave off a bit of a laugh and let the poor girl know that it’s all right.  “It’s cool girl, I understand.  I was like that when I was your age.  I too was a little embarrassed at the fact that I looked like the teenage version of the ugly duckling.  But as years passed, my ugliness faded and I have become the ravishing gal that I’ve grown to be.  Give it a few years and maybe you can become as perfect as me.”  The light soon changed green as Kellie continued to drive to the beach.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and knew that Kellie was right.  With her memories altering, she remembered the Kellie was going through a gawky teen phase and in a matter of years, she looks completely hot.  Perhaps in a few years, she can be just like her too.  Or to be more precise in Katie’s view, a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Katie could feel another tingle as she grew another couple of inches, reaching four.  Her maturing body continued its crossover through adulthood as she could see her body shaping very finely.  Her breasts expanded a little more, shaping into a pair of perky B cup breasts.  Her hips and waistline curved up some more, as the hourglass shape was looking well defined.  Her arms and legs stretched further and her muscles grew to athletic proportions.  Her face matures even more as her freckles faded out of existence, replaced with multiple pimples spread throughout most of her face.  Her hair was now at her upper back and was getting shiny and wavy.  Katie could also feel her swimsuit shifting again to help accommodate her aging body.  It darkened to solid black and started to look a little bit skimpy with her cleavage starting show.  Same goes for her flip-flops as they opened up more and turned into just straps, leaving his regular style sandals.  And her board shifted a little more into a much more professional style board teens like to go on.  Katie looked to her sweet sixteen self and could tell that she was a little bit ugly.  But she knows that it’s a matter of time before she has a beautiful face.<br />
<br />
“Yo, Kate?”<br />
<br />
Katie heard her sister’s voice and turned to see what she wants.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Kel?”<br />
<br />
“Think you can put your surfboard in the back seat.  It’s getting a little too big to fit the front seat and you’re not a kid anymore.” She told her.<br />
<br />
Kate heard that and looked to the board.  She noticed that it was taller, sleeker, much more stylish for a teenage surfer.  Looking at the current size, she would guess that it was starting to get too big for the front seat.  “Oh right!   Sorry.  Let me take care of that.”<br />
<br />
With that, she picked up the surfboard and carefully slides it to the back seat.  Placing it on the side, she turned to Kellie and said to her, “Again, sorry.  I could’ve sworn that surfboard was smaller when we left.”<br />
<br />
Kelly waved it off and said to her, “It’s cool, sis.  You always get use to having that surfboard in the front seat when you started surfing.  Now look at you, already teen and becoming professional.  I bet when you grow up, you’re going to become the best surfer in the world.  I mean, you’ve already won a few trophies in your name, so you won’t have a problem with taking on the rest of the surfing world.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard that and remembered what her altering mind is telling her.  Growing through her teens, she had been practicing and participating in surf competitions at a young age.  And from what Kellie said, she must becoming successful and earning accolades at a young age.  “Yeah…  Sure…  Guess you could say that.” She said looking away.  At least she’s not calling her a Tweeb.  That was annoying.  Maybe in time, she could be calling her a twin.  That soon changes when a tingle came up and she grew again.<br />
<br />
Katie could feel herself growing into a teen of seventeen.  She’s inching closer to the five-foot mark and was near the adult size.  She took a deep breath as she her body matured into a young adult status.  Breasts now grew to BB and his hips flared more and more, getting curvier by the second.  With her arms and legs stretching, the muscle tone expanded and toned to the point of athletic status.  She could feel her face maturing more and more as her cheekbones were looking a little high and there were fewer pimples dotting her face, leaving most of the skin really smooth.  Other changes of her face took place with her eyes getting smaller, nose thinning and getting longer, and lips getting a bit puffy.  Her hair lower down her upper back and was reaching midway through.  She crossed her legs very womanly and could feel her body language changed.  Once she was all preppy and happy as a young girl, now she was turning into a mature woman with the strength and ability of a surfer girl.<br />
<br />
As Katie looked on, she could feel the wind from above her.  Looking up, she noticed the roof of the car opening a hole and growing, exposing more of the warm air.  She looked around and noticed that the car is continuing to change to match her new age.  It was changing to a sleeker, more durable, and fast model as the engine was sounding that it had a whole lot more horsepower than ever.  Almost like the car is changing into something young college kids could drive.<br />
<br />
Sensing another tingling coming, she sat back and felt her body growing a little more until it went past the five-foot mark.  The last of her body matured one last time, making her look like a young woman then a kid at ten.  Her breasts stopped growing and were now a pair of bouncy C cups while the last of her hips expand and was extremely curvy.  The muscle tone on her arms and legs remained the same, but her skin darkened a bit more it makes it look like she looked to be of African descent, which she isn’t.  All the remaining pimples on her face disappeared as well, leaving it smooth and flawless.  She could even feel her braces magically removed from her teeth as she opened her mouth partly to reveal her teeth looking all evened out and pearly white.  Along the way, she could see no trace of her childish innocent anywhere.  Instead it was a complete beauty with lips to kiss, sultry eyes, and an elegant nose.  Her hair grew longer and was at the middle of her back and was shining a blonde hue.  Her bathing suit shifted a little bit and was looking more scantily, yet moderate.  It now looked like a black strapless bikini top and a thong like panties with a really thin string.  Katie never thought that teens could wear something like that, but she is a surfer girl and those types of girls like to look sexy in the beach.  She could even feel her sandals shifting a little, as the heel was getting a little higher.  Looking down, she now had heel like sandals that show off her elegant surfing feet.  The eighteen-year-old looked to herself and was glad that she looked beautiful compared to the pimples and braces that she had on.<br />
<br />
Looking back she could see the back seat wasn’t there.  Instead, it looked like her surfboard, which was longer and designed for speed, had hooks attached to it to prevent it from falling off.  The car itself was getting sleeker and newer with a cherry red color on the paint job.  Even the music Kellie is listening to was louder and crisper as a new surround sound system replaced the old one that was dated.  Turning to the dashboard and could also see that it was even more advance with a GPS on the screen and digital gauges compared to the old ones.  No doubt the car is shaping to match the altered reality she wished for with her growing body.  As if on cue, she now grew another year and became eighteen.<br />
<br />
Her body and face remained the same; however she was getting fit than expected.  While her C cups were round and full, she were giggly, as she was more focused on sports and not sex appeal.  Even her stomach gurgled as a dusting of abs started to appear.  Even her arms and legs were showing toughness and tones as where was nothing flabby about them.  Ruffling her hair, she also felt something different and looked to her dashboard mirror.  So far nothing much has changed, but she couldn’t help but notice that the hair was shrinking upwards and going up her back.  She wondered why.<br />
<br />
“So, Kate, which college are you planning to go to after high school?” Kellie asked her.<br />
<br />
Hearing that, she turned to her and was a little confused.  “Uh…  College?” she stuttered.<br />
<br />
“Um…  Yeah!  With all that prize money you’ve been hording over the years, it’s no doubt that you are saving up for a college education.  So where are you heading?  Harvard?  Yale?  C’mon, you got to tell me.” She pestered her sister.<br />
<br />
Kate was a little nervous and didn’t know what to say.  She was actually growing up so fast that she didn’t have time in processing all of this.  “I…  I don’t know.  I haven’t thought ahead of that.”<br />
<br />
Kelly gave a groan and said in an annoying voice, “Seriously?  You don’t know?  Kate, you’re just about to graduate in high school and you don’t know where to go next.  Don’t tell me you considering surfing your whole life.”<br />
<br />
Kate sighed and said, “Please Kel, I’m still thinking about my options.  Sure surfing is awesome and I have a lot of success because of it.  But if I go to some university, I would be away from the beach and would never surf again.  Hmm…  Maybe if I find a place close to the beach.  That might work well.”<br />
<br />
Kellie twirled her hair around and said with a defeated tone, “Okay, Kate.  Whatever you want, I won’t judge you.  Still, finding a college near the beach could be impossible.  Just saying.”<br />
<br />
Katie laughed it off as she felt another tingle.  Nothing much has changed, but she felt some heaving pricking on her back, making her feel some discomfort.  Adjusting her shifting seat, she laid back and felt that prickling gone.  Course what she didn’t know was that was coming to the age of poor college choice.  One of those poor choices was getting a tattoo, hence why she felt a prick on her back,  It was actually drawing a pair of angel wings with some coloring of which on it.  A banner appeared over it and with a title that said, ‘Surfing Goddess’.  Her swim suit shifting a bit to accommodate her growing body with a see through elegant robe materialized over her body.<br />
<br />
Kate tried to get comfortable as the prickling kept going.  Kelly noticed that and asked her, “You feeling alright, sis?”<br />
<br />
Kate turned with a warm smile and answered with, “Yeah…  I’m good…  I just need to get a little comfortable is all.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed and knew what happened.  “It’s about that tattoo you got, huh?  I told you it was a dumb decision to get something that big on your back.  I mean, what does Surfing Goddess mean?  Sounds like a weird nick name, if you ask me?”<br />
<br />
Katie heard and reminded her of the competitions she took part of.  “Hey!  I’ll have you know that name suits me.  My years of surfing experience earned that title since day one.  Give it some time and it will grow on ya.”<br />
<br />
Kellie got annoyed and said back, “Whatever…  Still feels like a dumb name to me.”<br />
<br />
Katie could hear the annoyance going back again and knew that it would only be temporary.  Feeling the tingle again, she has reached college statues and legal statue.  Still, nothing has changed but there are some slight things added here and there.  For one she felt pricks on her left eyebrow and a few more on her ears.  Looking to the mirror, she could see that she has three piercings on that eyebrow on one end of the eyebrow and a few extra piercings on the top of her ears.  A few more mistakes to add to the one she currently has.  She could even see her hair growing shorter as it brushed past her shoulders.  She was still confused as of why she has her hair shorter, but she’ll get her answer soon enough.<br />
<br />
“You know, Kate, once we get to the beach, there’s a Tiki bar I can take you to have a few shots.  I mean, you are twenty one, so it’s fair you celebrate you next step towards adulthood.  What do you say?” Kellie immediately asked her.<br />
<br />
Katie did a double take and said back, “You serious, Kel?  You want me to get drunk?  You know I’m not ready to drink a lot.  Remember what happened the last time you got drunk on your 21st birthday?  You were a mess back then.”<br />
<br />
Kellie chuckled and responded with, “Okay…  I admit…  My 21st Birthday wasn’t my best.  Had myself in the hospital when I almost got alcohol poisoning in my body.  Guess that would teach me for drinking a full bottle of tequila in one go.  Along with a couple of shots of burgundy, a Mai Tai, and a dozen beers.”<br />
<br />
“Like I said,” she repeated, “a mess.”<br />
<br />
Kellie soon pushed that thought and said, “Besides, your 21st won’t be like mine.  I’ll start you off with something light.  Maybe a few shots of Bacardi.  Then next time, we’ll start with a glass of white wine before going to the red later on.  Maybe a Merlot of a Pinot Noir, that’s light right.”<br />
<br />
Katie laughed it off and said, “Actually, I might think of getting a Bahamas Mama.  We’re in a beach after all.  Might as well enjoy the feel of it.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled and said, “Now you’re talking my language.”<br />
<br />
Katie felt another tingle and grew past 21 and entered 22.  While nothing’s changed, she could see that her hair was growing much more shorter and was redesigned into a short bob cut.  But not only that, she could see her face gaining some high cheekbones to make her not only sexy, but mature.  While not entering an age that she should be worried about, at least she still looks pretty good for that age.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kate.” said Kellie.<br />
<br />
Kate turned to her own twin sister and said, “Yes Kel?”<br />
<br />
“When we get to the beach, think we can find some hot guys?  I think I’m in the mood for some serious hunk if you know what I mean.”<br />
<br />
Kate rolled her eyes around and told her not yet.  “Come on sis.  We can’t go man searching just yet.  We have to practice for the tournament this week to get the prize money.  After all, you need it to go to that law school you want to attend.  You can’t give up on that.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed and knew that her twin has a point.  Since she was a little girl, she wanted to become a lawyer.  She wanted to go to the best law school in the country, but the price tag in going there is extremely expensive.  She thinks that the grand prize money in the contest could help her get there.  Which is why they were heading to the beach, to practice.<br />
<br />
“Fine…  Whatever you say sis.” she said in defeat, “Let’s hope there’s any waves coming up, otherwise it will all be a complete bummer.”  Katie nodded and sat back to relax.<br />
<br />
As they were nearing the beach, Katie could feel the remaining years upwards until she finally reached the desired age of twenty-five.  Her body was a complete athlete with tough and tone physique.  Her C cups were round and has more muscle then fat while her stomach was trimmed and flat with a six pack dusting.  Her arms and legs were long and toned as she spent over a decade in the gym, swimming, and surfing.  And her skin has a golden tan makes her look like a different race.  Looking to her face, she could see a she is a goddess and no signs of a childish persona of ten.  With sultry eyes, thin nose, plushy lips, and high cheekbones, with was the antificis of a beauty.  But what caught her attention is her hair.  It had shrunk upwards across her neck and stopped at the top of the head.  It was then that it was redesigned into something surfer girls have.  The ring of her head was nothing but a buzz cut as the top part sticks like that that of a small shark fin.  It was strange for her, but she like the look as it is easy to surf around.  Her bathing suit remained the same but slightly altered to match her growing body.  And while the back tattoo of angel wings was still there, Katie felt a little prick on her left shoulder and looked to see what it is.  What she discovered is a heart tattoo with the words, ‘Kellie’ on the ribbon.  Katie looked on and was amazed that it actually appeared on her.  She then looked to her former mothers and saw the same tattoo on her right shoulder, only with the words, ‘Katie’ on the ribbon.  She looked on and could tell that they now had tattoos with each other names, a strong bond between twins.  She could even feel memories swarming into her brain, memories of the two being twins.  Memories of them being born together, playing together, being in the same schools, the activities they’re both playing, until they would surf together to get money for themselves.  Katie’s was amazed as once they were mother and daughter, are now identical twin sisters of eighteen and a half.  The car finished changing as well as the top opened fully, the windows went downward, and the car finished shifting.  Now the car went from being an old, raggedy Honda Civic to a sleek and cherry red Jaguar F-Type sports car with the wind blowing through Kellie’s hair.  It was one of the prizes Katie won in a surfing competition and in Katie’s memory; it was the greatest prize of them all.<br />
<br />
After a long drive and a long change, the two made it to the beach as Kellie said, “Well, we’re here!”<br />
<br />
Katie heard that and said, “Finally!  I swear that trip was long.  But I bet it would be worth the long ass drive.  I need to practice for my next surfing competition”<br />
<br />
Kellie chuckled and said, “Trust me.  When we get there, you will have all the fun you want.”<br />
<br />
The twin sister parked her car into the parking spot near the beach and the two got out of there.  Now the beach has a lot to do.  Other then the sand the waves, there’s Volleyball, basketball, and baseball courts to play sports.  A boardwalk to play some games, shop, or eat out, and an amusement pier to go on rides and have a good time.  But mostly it’s just surf and sun, giving that the place is popular with its waves.  And that’s something Katie wishes to do.<br />
<br />
Getting her sleek and powerful board out of the back, Katie places it under her arm and said, “All right, I’m ready to catch some waves.”<br />
<br />
Kellie got out of her seat and told her what she wants to do.  “You go do that, sis.  I’ll be catching some rays while going online in helping out on a few cases.”<br />
<br />
Kate was surprised by that sand said, “You kidding me?  We’re here for some fun in the sand and your mind is one working?  We’re on vacation.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, this is a work vacation for me.  My superiors want me to get through with these cases before Monday.  Just cause we’re twins doesn’t mean I have to catch a break like you.” She said with annoyance, “You go have your fun.  I’ll meet up with you when I’m done.  It won’t take me long.”<br />
<br />
Katie sighed and figured this was going to be the case.  While they are now twins and share everything together, they both are polar opposite.  Katie is more of a free spirited woman who likes to party and ride the waves.  Kellie was still an attorney apprentice and is more reserve and down to earth.  So maybe there’s not much they share.<br />
<br />
Feeling defeated, she sighed and said, “Okay…  Just don’t waste your time today.  I have plans for the two of us.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gave a wave as she took out her bag filled with beach supplies and an umbrella and said, “No prob.  I’ll be finished before you know it.”<br />
<br />
So the two went their separate ways as one is going to have fun while the other would go to work.  And while Katie didn’t like the end result, in the end, at least she got her wish and they are now bonded sisters for life.</p>
