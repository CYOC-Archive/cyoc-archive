<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>During the day, Jen's mind occasionally drifted back to her earlier orgasm. Had she actually been forced to masturbate because of Kyle's dare, or did she just do it on her own because she wanted to? It happened so fast after Kyle hung up the phone, she couldn't remember exactly what she had been thinking. Maybe the curse was true after all...or at least the Dare part of it. It seemed very unlikely that orgasms would make her dumber, curse or no curse. Besides, did that kind of thing count as a "transformation" anyway?
<P>"Miss Smith," the teacher called. Jen bolted upright in her chair. She was sitting in Mr. Worth's math class, fifth period, and had clearly let her mind wander for too long. "Would you care to finish this equation?" He pointed to the board, where he had written the first three lines of an algebra problem.
<P>"Of course," Jen said in a way that mocked insult. She wasn't about to let him get away with catching her daydreaming in the middle of class. She knew her math well enough to breeze through this example. She took the chalk from Mr. Worth's open palm and got to work on the fourth line.
<P>She could hear a few students giggling behind her, and that just served to make her angrier. A few of them had probably noticed her dazed expression while she was lost in thought. She continued solving the problem, trying to shut out the giggling.
<P>When she was finished, she turned to Mr. Worth with a cocky smile and handed him the chalk. She started walking back toward her seat.
<P>"Fine work," he said behind her. "But why did you solve for "x?"
<P>Jennifer stopped in her tracks and spun around. Wasn't she supposed to? It was algebra, after all. She looked over the entire sequence of lines on the board, but couldn't figure out where she had gone wrong.
<P>Mr. Worth could see the confusion on her face, and silently tapped the variable in the first line. It was a "y."
<P>"'y' equals 25, Miss Smith, not 'x'."
<P>She had accidentally used an "x" in her lines of the solution. The entire class burst into laughter, which Mr. Worth held up his arms to stop. Jennifer quickly fell into her seat, red-faced from embarrassment and anger.
<P>"Class, this is an important example of work ethic. You can have excellent multiplication and division skills, but even the slightest loss of focus can create a careless mistake."
<P>Within the next half-hour, the incident was brushed aside in her mind in favor of memories from her morning orgasm. As she sat in science class, she continued to ponder the circumstances surrounding it. It had felt better than a usual orgasm, possibly because it had been the morning when she was full of energy. She resolved to try it again tomorrow before heading to school.
<P>The rest of the day passed quickly. Once the final period bell rang, Jennifer went to her locker to organize her homework, and then meet up with her boyfriend. She couldn't wait to see him. For some reason just the thought of him made her nether regions heat up.
<P>Nathan hadn't been her boyfriend for long. Jennifer went through them like tissues. This latest one was doing pretty well, however. They'd been going out consistently for over two months. Jennifer enjoyed his company, and the sex was great of course, but never before today was she looking forward to it quite as much.
<P>She blinked and came back to reality once again. She realized that as she was thinking about Nathan, she'd been turning her combination lock around and around. She finally stopped it at the first number, then reversed it to the second, but paused. What was the third number? She glared up at the ceiling, trying to remember. 19, 44...
<P>"Oh! Duh." It was 14. The first digits of the other numbers. That's how she always remembered it before. The lock popped open and she began exchanging notebooks.
<P>Nathan was waiting for her out in the parking lot, standing by her car as usual. They hugged and kissed upon meeting.
<P>"Woah, a little frisky today," Nathan chuckled. Jennifer's tongue had been more forceful than she had intended.
<P>"It's just really good to see you," Jennifer said. "I've had a frustrating day."
<P>"You can tell me all about it when we get to the burger place," Nathan said. Jennifer always gave him rides in the afternoon; the days he didn't have rugby practice, anyway. Nathan didn't have his own car. A minor inconvenience for Jennifer, but she put up with it for other obvious benefits.
<P>She told him the story of how she had mistaken "y" for "x" in math class and the students' mocking. The story was embellished in the typical Jennifer Smith style. In this version, the teacher joined in on the laughter and several spitwads were launched from the classmates.
<P>Nathan was quick to console her. "It was an easy mistake. You should be proud that you got the answer right. I probably wouldn't have. Why don't I talk to Mr. Worth about it tomorrow, let him know who he's messing with?"
<P>"Um...no, no, it's okay, really. I can handle it." Jennifer may be a little vindictive, but she wasn't about to let her boyfriend threaten a teacher she knew hadn't really been cruel to her. "But suppose you and your rugby pals have a little chat with a few of the kids in the class?"
<P>Nathan smirked in understanding as their car sped down the road.</p>
