<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Amy” and Sarah don’t talk during the first two periods, when the bell for the lunch break rings, Sarah gets to her feet and says, “finally, let’s get out of this stinky classroom, Amy,” and starts to walk towards the door.<br />
<br />
The “little girl” gets to her feet and hurries after the taller girl, they then walk down the hallway, not talking with each other, Jeff knows, from his observations of the two, that Sarah does the talking and Amy just stays silent, unless Sarah asks for her opinion. Whenever Amy says something, without having Sarah’s “permission” to do so, then the pink haired girl starts to “put the smaller girl in her place”, so in order to pass as Amy, Jeff decides to do exactly what the original would do.<br />
<br />
As they turn a corner they spot Jeff’s friends standing together, all with concerned expressions, Jeff/”Amy” believes he knows why: he hadn’t sent them a text, letting them know that he’d not be attending school for the day, ‘I should have texted them, telling them that I have fallen sick or something,’ he thinks to himself. The little “girl” then feels Sarah nudge her, when she looks up, she notices the taller girl scowling at her, “wh-what’s up, Sarah?”<br />
<br />
“I was talking to you,” she says, “you didn’t react… AMY!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” gulps, “s-sorry… I,” she says, “I was kind of zoned out!”<br />
<br />
Sarah rolls her eyes, “actually,” she says, “that is typical for Amy. Anyway, I was saying: let’s see if you really are able to be mean to your friends.”<br />
<br />
“What would you like me to do,” the “girl” asks.<br />
<br />
“When I insult them, think of something suitable to add,” the taller girl says, “especially if that perv Dean starts to think he can flirt with us.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “I think I’ll manage,” she says, “after all, this is my chance to tell them what I really think about them without them knowing it’s actually me. I think this will be fun.”<br />
<br />
“Just make sure to not overdo it,” Sarah warns, “remember how the original always behaves, we don’t want them to think that “Amy” is any different than usual, if you get my drift!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “understood,” she says, then the two start to walk up to the group.<br />
<br />
“Well, well,” Sarah says, when she and “Amy” reach the group, “if it’s not the loser-squad. What’s wrong? Have you lost something? Where is Mr. “I’m always late and proud of it”-loser?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” “Amy” pipes in, trying to grin in a mean way like the original would, “where is he? I haven’t seen him around all day! Has he forgotten which school he attends? Wouldn’t surprise me… he is REALLY not that smart! Ha… he my be the dumbest of all of you!”<br />
<br />
Katrina and Janet both frown, while Dean just grins stupidly at the two girls, his eyes scanning their bodies.<br />
<br />
“Why can’t you two bitches just leave us alone for ONE FUCKING day,” Katrina asks.<br />
<br />
“Besides,” Janet pipes in, “if we knew why he has not shown up, YOU’D be the LAST people we’d tell!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, come on, Kat and Janet,” Dean says, still with that stupid pervy grin on his face, staring directly at Sarah’s tits, “don’t be so mean to the two angles, just for being just as concerned as we are!”<br />
<br />
‘Really… Dean is really something else,’ “Amy” thinks to herself, ‘he really can’t stop being all flirty. And the way he stares at me and Sarah is disgusting. Man… being a girl really makes me understand every girl in this school, if not the whole town… he’s such a creep!’<br />
<br />
Sarah shoots Dean “just die”-look, then simply says, “come, Amy! Let’s leave these losers worry about their BABY boy! We have better things to do!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” giggles, “yeah, like, checking the latest fashion! Hm… I hope that new dress I saw in the magazine this morning is already out!”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “so, later, losers,” she says, then both “Amy” and Sarah leave.<br />
<br />
“Hey, how about I accompany you two beauties to the mall after school,” they hear Dean call after them.<br />
<br />
“Amy” and Sarah simply ignore the boy, knowing all to well what will happen, and sure enough they hear a loud smack, followed by Dean yelling “OUCH!”, which signals that the boy got whacked across the face by Katrina.<br />
<br />
When the two girls turn the corner, “Amy” stops walking, “Sarah, there is one thing I’d like to do,” she says.<br />
<br />
Sarah turns, frowning at the short “girl”, “what…,” she is about to ask before noticing that “Amy” has her phone out. The taller girl tilts her head, “what are you planning,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Amy” grins, “just wait and see,” she says, “you’ll love it,” with that “Amy” opens the App and activates the scanner.<br />
<br />
After a while, the phone gives off a “ping” sound, when “Amy” opens the file-folder, she finds that every single teacher and student in the school has been scanned. The “girl” scrolls through the files until she finds Dean’s, grinning to herself she opens the boy’s file, “time to give Dean a makeover,” she says and starts to type.<br />
<br />
Sarah raises an eyebrow, “what are you talking about, Amy,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks up at Sarah, grinning, “just keep your eyes on Dean,” she says, walking to the corner and peeking around. Confused Sarah follows the smaller “girl” and peeks around the corner herself, “ready,” the “girl” asks, “watch Dean closely,” she then confirms whatever she put into the App.<br />
<br />
They notice Dean shiver, Sarah, remembering what Jeff told her, knows that something is about to happen to Dean, but like with Jeff before, nothing seems to happen.<br />
<br />
As Sarah continues to watch Dean, she suddenly notices something happening to the boy’s nose: it seems to flatten and grow, soon Dean is sporting the snout of a… PIG!<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK,” they hear everyone who witnessed the change, including Janet and Katrina, yell in shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
“What,” Dean asks, “why is everyone… WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO MY NOSE!?”<br />
<br />
Sarah can’t help herself, nor can “Amy”, as both girls burst out laughing, “now he’s got the “nose” to show what a PIG he actually is,” the “little girl” says.<br />
<br />
They then notice a certain girl hurrying up to the stunned crowed, both girls recognize Maria, the school’s reporter, both look at each other and grin, “oh, this is to perfect,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Dean,” Maria says, already holding her camera up, “smile for the camera,” and with a “click” the picture of “Pig-Nose-Dean” is taken. Maria smiles to herself, “perfect,” she says, “as of tomorrow, you’ll be famous! I can see the headline: “Pig-Boy Dean, the PERV got what he deserves!”!”<br />
<br />
Everyone, except Katrina, Janet and Dean burst out laughing, Sarah and “Amy” watch as Katrina starts to advance on Maria, but Maria already is sprinting down the hallway. Janet herself is to stunned to utter a word, and poor Dean is crying his eyes out.<br />
<br />
“I think the damage is done,” Sarah says, sounding really pleased, “come, Amy. Time for us to leave this freakshow!”<br />
<br />
The two walk down the hallway, “I must say, Amy,” Sarah says, still grinning, “I was not expecting THAT from you. I mean, isn’t Dean your best friend?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks up at Sarah, “I wouldn’t consider him a “best friend”, but, yeah, he IS my friend,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Then why would you be so… mean to him,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“Amy” grins, “look who’s talking,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Watch it, GIRL,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
“Amy” chuckles, “to be honest, I always thought of him as a “pig”. I mean, he’s such a perv and always grabbing girls, so I figured to give him a lesson,” she says, “his nose will be back to normal when he wakes up tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“What about Maria, the picture and tomorrow’s news,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, by tomorrow everyone will have forgotten what has happened,” the “little girl” says, “I gave Maria a command to delete the picture, then I input a command which will cause everyone to forget the whole thing. Everything will be back to normal tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “I see,” she says, “well, I had a good laugh. Actually, that makes me feel a lot better than before.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” smiles, “I thought I’d manage to cheer you up,” she says, “by the way: am I doing a good job as “Amy” so far?”<br />
<br />
Sarah looks at the “girl”, “so far… yes,” she says, “but the day isn’t over yet, so, we’ll see where it ends. As of now though, you actually managed to make me happier, you aren’t as bad as I thought.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” smiles, “you’re not that bad yourself,” she says, “actually, so far, I’m having more fun hanging with you than my… friends.”<br />
<br />
By now the two girls have returned to their classroom and sat down at their desk, “is that so,” Sarah asks, looking over at the “girl”.<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “yeah, I really mean it,” she says, “I mean… I’d prefer being myself, than pretending to be someone else, but if I were my true self, we wouldn’t be hanging out, because you wouldn’t even allow me near you.”<br />
<br />
“True,” Sarah says, “but that sounds like you hate being a girl. Are you regretting doing me this… favour?”.<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks up at Sarah, “no,” she says, “I’m not regretting anything. As I said before: being a girl isn’t that bad, but I still would prefer being myself, because this is not who I am. I am only a “replacement” for a day, to make you happy, tomorrow… everything, including me, will be back to normal.”<br />
<br />
Sarah looks at the little “girl” seated next to her, ‘maybe I really misjudged Jeff,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I mean, he isn’t the perv I thought he was. He’s actually a really caring person, and I do owe him thanks for cheering me up by transforming himself into “Amy” and being so mean to his friends. I really need to thank him, I have a few ideas, but for them to work, I’d need my own Chronivac-App!’<br />
<br />
“Amy” is unaware of Sarah’s thoughts, the little “girl” shakes her head, “anyway,” she says, looking up at Sarah, smiling, “sorry for sounding so down. Let’s just make sure we both enjoy the day together.”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “yeah,” she says, “to be honest, I am already enjoying it more than if I would have declined your offer.”<br />
<br />
“I am glad to hear that,” the little “girl” says, “so, what’s the plan after school? Shopping trip?”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles at this, “sure, that was my plan anyway,” she says, “I think we’ll have a lot of fun!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” smiles, “I’m sure we will,” she says.</p>
