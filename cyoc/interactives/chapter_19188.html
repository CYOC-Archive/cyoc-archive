<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">the two men walked into the study, and Brad immediately closed the door and locked it. It was a dark room with a small window and a door to the outside on the other side. &quot;now, i know this is weird, no you're not dreaming, no, its not a hallucination.&quot; Brad began &quot;what the hell!&quot; Jim exclaimed. Jim noticed something else, his perspective had shifted, this man was now shorter than him, how was that possible?  <br />
<br />
&quot;shhh!, my daughter just got home, so we have to be quiet about this? ok?&quot; <br />
&quot;Dude, what the fuck happened to me, i feel... so, so... di-different&quot; Jim stuttered obviously shaken by the changes. He stared at his hands, pushed up his long sleeves exposing his now hairy forearms, He couldn’t help but examine his new body. He peaked under the collar of his shirt, and examined his muscular arms with his hands. &quot;My god, i really have changed, this is too weird&quot; Jim muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;ok, look at me, there is this program right here,&quot; jim pointed at the screen in the corner &quot;thank god my daughter didn’t get home while you were still changing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What program, what are you talking about?!? how old am i? what did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;shhh! anyway, its called the chronovac and it can physically change people. I was just testing it out, i didn’t think it would work&quot; Jim fibbed &quot;but as you can see, it really has&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How much to i weigh? God, i need to see for myself, you better not do anything while im changing,&quot; Jim responded, obviously confused. He began by unbuttoning his snug shirt and loosening his tie. &quot;damnit, where did i get these clothes? they weren’t here when i arrived. Did you knock me out or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;no no, it was just what the program can do, what you have, err, had on is your pizza uniform, just altered, that’s all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jim was now wearing a snug white undershirt and in his, his shoes, long black socks all lying on the floor. &quot;Goddamn!&quot; he couldn’t contain himself, his body was so much larger, his muscular chest stuck out in front of him, and he could feel his weight shift as he moved, he felt so more, well, meaty, and his arms looked buff, his shoulders were wider and his legs looked big too, and the hair! there was hair everywhere. Looking down, Jim felt for the first time his stubble rubbing up against his thick neck as he tilted his head down to examine himself. His arms were hairy as well, and from what he could see under his shirt, his chest was as well, and his legs too. <br />
<br />
&quot;god, what did you do to me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad went over to the computer. &quot;here are your new stats. You are 35 years old&quot; &quot;THIRTY FIVE?!?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;shh! lower your voice! please, unless you want to look like an idiot... You are six foot two inches.&quot; &quot;damn, no wonder you look shorter&quot; &quot;and you weigh, lets see, 235 pounds.&quot; &quot;whoa! no wonder i feel so massive, god, how...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ok, don’t worry, just calm down, i'll change you right back, it will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;change me back? with that program? do you have to? i mean, man, this is incredible. So do you mean to say, that not only is this real, but that i can stay this way permanently?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;well, if you want to, i guess, but what will people say? i mean, don’t you have family and friends? don’t you think they'd like to now how you turned into a large 35 year old man?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;uh, yeah, but man, i feel, i don’t know, powerful, my voice is deeper, i feel more... like more, and i like that, i guess. man this is crazy&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;don’t worry, again, its fine... look, you gotta change back... hell, I’ll change with you, if you want, i haven’t tried it with myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;dude, im 17 years old, but i like this body, can i stay big?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;dont you think people will notice? I mean, people don’t grow overnight, even young men like yourself... i mean, well, you used to be...&quot; Brad trailed off<br />
<br />
&quot; Ok, just change me back then. i guess i can live with being myself. haha, this is nuts, i feel so... indescribable&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;ok ok, dude, dont worry, i'll work. Hey this this has a timer on it...&quot; Brad said while turning to the screen. &quot;you could change over a certain amount of time... hell it even has years on here...&quot; Brad was now fully engrossed in figuring out the program. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what's your name?&quot; Jim asked. &quot;brad, im brad, and you're jim...i saw the tag, while you still had it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;oh ok.&quot; Jim replied &quot;are you really gonna change too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not? the only problem is getting out of here without my daughter noticing. I guess there is the door right there,&quot; Brad pointed to the door to the back yard. <br />
<br />
&quot;ok, you will change back in an instant, and your clothes will be back to normal... except a few things... your age will now be 18, hopefully it wont be too terribly noticeable, and you will be 5'9&quot; in stead of 5'8&quot;, you will weigh 170, but it will be all muscle in stead of fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;sweet&quot; Jim said &quot;but i still gotta shrink, and man, i don’t want to leave this behind.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;well, if it makes you feel any better,  I’ll be 18 soon as well. that’s from 38, by the way, and im just trying to remember how i looked when i was your age... i mean... well, lets see, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad hit the enter key, and felt a sudden shock, he sort of froze, or he couldn’t feel much, but his eyes were open, and he could see Jim changing, he became slimmer, but remained muscular, in fact, he seemed far more muscular than Brad had expected. Brad felt his own clothes loosen as well.<br />
<br />
Suddenly it stopped, and there they were, 18 years old &quot;damn, that was quick&quot; Brad said in a noticeably higher pitch. &quot;these clothes don’t work so well, do they? looking at his baggy button up shirt and pants which just couldnt stay up anymore. He now stood about 5'10&quot;, down two inches, and he weighed considerably less. The stats on the screen said 145 pounds. He was skinny! he was really skinny again. He has forgotten about his days as a beanpole, before he had gone to college and lifted weights. <br />
<br />
&quot;man, i feel normal again, but you look... wow&quot; Jim said. &quot;Well, young sir, it seems you wont change much in a year, but 20 years certainly did a number on me! I forgot how scrawny i was when i was your age...&quot; he needed clothes to fit, he had lost 60 some pounds, and was swimming in his clothes. <br />
<br />
Brad quickly adjusted the options- &quot;set clothing to fit&quot; and sure enough, the button up shirt and khakis soon fit just fine. <br />
<br />
Man! im too small, and look at you! you're so buff!&quot; Brad exclaimed. He felt so light and thin. &quot;yeah, it doesn’t feel like i lost any muscle, i mean, i did, but i still feel buff, i love this, but my shirt, my clothes, are sorta tight in places... odd, and my waistband is loose&quot; jim replied.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, you look pretty muscular, there, Jim, i hope its no big deal...hm... maybe 170 pounds is a good number for both of us?, I’m just too skinny!, ah, it'll work, nobody will recognize me anyway... but I’ll adjust the time change... so it will happen over an hour or so. Brad clicked enter and changed the transformation time. He realized that the transformation included an option to &quot;freeze subject during transformation&quot; and he quickly took that option off. <br />
<br />
&quot;well, what do we do now?&quot; Brad turned around to Jim. &quot;well, i get off in like a half hour, i have to go back to the place though. Good timing i guess... Man, i wonder what people are gonna say to me now... I feel awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Brad closed down the program, and lid of his laptop, and grabbed the chronovac CD. They slipped out the back door quietly, into the street and into the pizza man's car. Everything was different to Brad, the seat felt larger than it might normally, and he felt light and energetic. &quot;its a good thing i'll be buff in an hour, because i don’t like being this small&quot; <br />
<br />
Jim drove to the pizza hut and parked his car, about 10 minutes had passed and Brad was now about 150 pounds, but it still wasn’t really noticeable. &quot;I hope they like my new muscles&quot; he said confidently, &quot;i should be about 10 minutes, I’ll try and get off early. We can go to my house.. my mom and dad are out of town and my sister moved out last week... so its all good. You have the CD, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Brad said as Jim left. He disappeared into the building, and brad waited there for a bit. In a half hour, less than that, he was now in the car of some kid he didn’t know, and was turned into an 18 year old, a growing 18 year old at that, Which reminded Brad of his current transformation. Ben looked down and examined his own, still skinny body to look for signs of muscle growth.</p>
