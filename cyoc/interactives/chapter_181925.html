<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Stop smiling you fucking idiot,” Lettie swore as they meandered towards her favourite coffee shop. Phil couldn’t stop smiling though, she was so cute when she insulted him.<br />
<br />
They’d been together a couple years by that point, in fact they’d both graduated from the nightmarish hellscape that was school. It was hard to believe their relationship even worked, maybe it was bound together by some kind of demonic magic or maybe it was something more, it was hard to tell.<br />
<br />
Despite her swearing she still held his hand as they walked along the sidewalk, and despite her insults and statements that he was a useless burden on society she still pegged him stupid at least three times a week. He loved being insulted and she’d doubled down on those insults as time had worn on, her old insults growing stale and being replaced by new and far more crass ones. You should have seen how hard his dick got after he’d spent a Christmas with her family just a few months back. Her mom had decided to bug them about getting married and she hadn’t stopped fuming until a solid month had passed.<br />
<br />
“I am not a possession,” she’d ranted while jabbing a finger in his chest and glaring at him like he was a piece of dog shit smeared on her shoe. “You’re here to provide me with dick when I want it, got that dumbass?!”<br />
<br />
Still he loved her despite that and she hadn’t left him so maybe the insults were her way of showing it.<br />
<br />
Since school had ended she’d had to find new outlets for her feminist poetry and songs, so they’d taken to hanging around a cafe twice a week to catch some of the performances. Lettie had even performed up there a few times and when he’d clapped and cheered her on she’d screamed at him to sit down and shut up through the Mike. That night had probably been the best sex they’d ever had.<br />
<br />
“Stop offering to carry my shit,” she’d bark at him on music nights before roughly pounding him in the bathroom after she’d finished performing.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t performing that night but he couldn’t stop grinning stupidly at her. She kept shooting him these harsh and hateful glares and wishing she was a lesbian right to his face but he couldn’t stop smiling. Tonight would grant him the best sex yet, he was going to piss her off so much. She didn’t show it, and he was all the happier for that, but she loved him, he was a great boyfriend who allowed her to be as vulgar and angry as she wanted. He was exactly the type of liberating guy she’d dreamed of, someone who didn’t want her to be polite or nice like society demanded. She could be herself around him and he was always grinning stupidly at her no matter how much she changed her appearance.<br />
<br />
They drank coffee and listened to feminist slam poetry while she kicked him under the table for daring to offer payment for the drinks. He just smirked at her with a half closed mouth that made her glare even more and scowl angrily. She was so pretty when she scowled.<br />
<br />
“What are you up to dumbass?” She demanded but he wouldn’t tell, at least not yet.<br />
<br />
It was the usual Friday night, a bunch of absurdist songs, short stories, and indie music listened to while they drank overpriced coffee and he listened to her complain about her day. She’d found steady use of her English degree as a junior editor at a local news organization and her boss made her dress all proper to work. She refused to wear a bra after hours because of that and hey, Phil wasn’t one to complain. It was both freeing for her and when she caught him looking she’d call him a pig. It was win win.<br />
<br />
After poetry and coffee they stood on a city bridge throwing rocks at the icy river and trying to break the biggest hole in it.<br />
<br />
“Fucking boss wants me to talk all proper,” she complained while throwing a rock so hard it probably could have broken someone’s jaw.<br />
<br />
“I like the way you talk,” Phil replied matter of factly.<br />
<br />
“Ooooh, the man likes how I talk, if I talked different you’d be telling me to talk like this. You’re a fucking sexist pig, you know that right. I wish you were dead,” she told him to his face and he just laughed, feeing so hot he was unable to resist his plan any more. He turned to his girlfriend grinning from ear to ear, dug into his pocket and got down on one knee, opening his little box to present her with a ring.<br />
<br />
“I fucking love you,” he proclaimed.<br />
<br />
“You little fucking cunt,” she swore while glaring at him so intensely she could probably melt ice with it. “You’re trying to tie me down and restrict my sexuality to just you! You’re a fucking dumbass and only an idiot would marry a loser like you.”<br />
<br />
“And are you an idiot?” He asked with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Seems like it,” she shrugged before marching up to him and pulling him up to his feet, pressing up against him and kissing him passionately.<br />
<br />
Sex had been wonderful before but that night was the best night of his life. His fiancé rotated around on his dick, shoved his face into her privates and made him lick her raw, and absolutely lost it when he splattered cum all over her face.<br />
<br />
“You think you’d have a little more semen saved up for your fiancé! What? Am I not pleasing you enough? Do you Jack off when I’m not around because you need me to be more sexual?! Do I have to suck you dry to get my fill dumbass?!” She ranted before cupping her lips around his dick and sucking him off until he let loose another jet of cum. That didn’t please her one bit.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I said yes to the wrong man, if you can’t provide me with enough fucking cum I’ll go out and find someone who can,” Lettie ranted while domineering over him and refusing to let him take command.<br />
<br />
“You’re fucking amazing,” Phil grinned.<br />
<br />
“Wipe that dumbass smirk off your face,” she roared while wrinkling her nose in disgust. “You think that just because I said yes to your pathetic proposal that you own me now. Hah! What a fucking load, or it would be if you could actually produce a decent amount of cum. It’s the only good thing about a man like you, your god damned semen. If you’re going to be my fiancé you better start producing more of it or I’ll fucking leave you at the alter. Otherwise what’s the fucking point?”<br />
<br />
They didn’t sleep that night, dozing off in each other’s arms at about six in the morning. When they woke up again they got right back to it. He mounted her from behind while she yawned in boredom and worked on an assignment from work like he wasn’t even there. It was so fucking hot he spurted cum into her vagina three times.<br />
<br />
She got her turn later when he was panting on the couch, in an exhausted daze with his dick throbbing in pain. She kept calling him weak while giving him a handjob that lasted at least half an hour before he squeezed out more semen.<br />
<br />
They were both exhausted by the evening, burnt out from so much sex they could barely move. She was splayed on his arm and clearly hated being coddled like some weak child in his arms but she was too weak to move, or at least that was her excuse.<br />
<br />
“See, you’re pathetic, I should have rejected that proposal,” Lettie panted while her beautiful breasts rose and fell with every breath.<br />
<br />
“Wait until your mom hears,” Phil chuckled. “She’ll think you’ve become a proper lady.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you, now that you’ve reminded me of that it’s over,” his fiancé growled in a matter of fact tone that he just grinned at. She’d thought of it. She knew her mom would freak out and start coddling her over her accepted proposal and she’d said yes despite that. She loved him, she just had a roundabout way of showing it. Turns out it wasn’t demon magic keeping them together because at that exact moment she wasn’t his girlfriend anymore. She was his fiancé.</p>
