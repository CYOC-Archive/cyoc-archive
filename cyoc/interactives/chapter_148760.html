<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Part 6<br />
<br />
Aaron was in a fancy restaurant with a table full of adults. He had ordered from the wine list, and his face turned almost as red when it came. He actually was starting to feel pretty grown up. That’s when he got a call on his cel phone from the elementary school. When people looked at him oddly as he got up to leave he explained “It’s my dad. I mean, my son. My dad called uh…to tell me my son got into a fight at school. I’m really sorry, but I have to go.”<br />
<br />
Aaron’s boss, or rather his father’s boss, (it was so hard to tell the difference on these things) shook his hand before he left and said “Jake, take the rest of the day off. You look like you could use it. I’m sure we can handle things here. Just make sure that you are ready to impress by Monday. We have a whole lot of material to cover then.”<br />
<br />
“OK. See you guys later.”<br />
<br />
Aaron took the express metro across town and got there by two. School was almost over, but as soon as he stepped inside the school it was a sudden dizziness. Everything was way smaller! And all of these little kids walking around…they used to be his size just last week. Trying to control his smile, he walked to the principal’s office. Man, this is cool. The principal can’t tell me what to do anymore.<br />
<br />
As he walked in he felt an immediate sense of ego wash over him. He was the tallest one in the room! He always had to look up at all the grown ups before…the secretaries, the administrators, the principal. Now he was looking down at a balding, and unthreatening Principal Spurner. Wearing a cocky smile, he shook his principal’s hand, which was now dwarfed by his own large, mannish grip. “How’s it goin, principal Spurner.”<br />
<br />
“How’s it goin, indeed. Your son was caught fighting in the cafeteria with this other little hooligan.” The principal indicated a larger boy who was frowning from where he sat, next to a guy Aaron assumed was his dad. The kid was Kurt Grundle. One of the worst bullies ever in the history of bullies. And now Aaron towered over to him. <br />
<br />
“Hi, there kid.” Aaron nodded. Kurt Grundle sneered back. Aaron decided to do his best dad impression. “Now, son. What have I told you about fighting, young man?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t do anything! He ambushed me! He was threatening to before, Principal Spurner, believe me I do not like making this accusation!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll bet you don’t. Look, we have a no tolerance fighting policy,” the principal said to Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Well if it’s bullies…” Aaron began.<br />
<br />
“Bullies my ass. Your kid just antagonized mine,” Kurt’s dad said. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, right,” Aaron said laughing. “Your kid is totally wailing on half the school and you’re blaming me? He was totally picking on m-him. On…my son. So maybe you need to teach your kid some manners!”<br />
<br />
“Where do you get off?”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, but I can explain what happened. I was minding my own business when he shoved me against a wall. I fought back because—“ Jake in Aaron’s body got cut off.<br />
<br />
“Oh shut up,” Kurt’s dad said.<br />
<br />
“Don’t tell him to shut up!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell who I want to shut up. I’m a corporate lawyer, pal. You want a lawsuit? You might be lookin’ at one.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I didn’t go to law school. Why didn’t I go to law school?” Principal Spurner said to himself, and began muttering.<br />
<br />
Aaron sized up the other dad. He was a gritty faced sandy blond guy with craggy skin…some stubble. Nice suit. Total asshole, just like his son.<br />
<br />
“For what? For your kid trying to pick a fight? If you try ANYthing with me, I’ll have half a dozen parents willing to testify against him,” Aaron said, pointing at Kurt “that he’s no good and a little jerk. So…just try it.” Aaron folded his arms. He posed a pretty impressive figure inside his dad’s body. He could tell it made the other man nervous. This guy was nowhere near as built as Aaron now was.<br />
<br />
“My mother said, son, go to law school. But no. I wanted to make a difference,” the principal continued.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, Kurt. We’re going home.” Kurt’s dad walked out, seething silent anger.<br />
<br />
“Not so fast. Your child is going to be disciplined if this checks out. I still have to talk with the cafeteria staff. They’ve gone home for the day but if they corroborate this then I’ll have no choice but to suspend Kurt for a week. That’s on his permanent record. This is the fourth time he’s been in fights this month. You should be prepared.” The principal waved them all off. “I’m gonna go in my office and call my mother. You need any info, just ask Claire here.” He indicated the receptionist wearing grandma glasses with a 50’s curlers hairdo.<br />
<br />
Kurt and his dad left and Aaron could hear the dad chewing Kurt out.<br />
<br />
“But dad!”<br />
<br />
“No buts this time! I am furious with you! I keep trying to cover for you and you screw up again! You’re going to be mowing the lawn for months! And forget about allowance or TV!”<br />
<br />
Aaron smiled and played with his tie and was practically glowing. He and Jake walked slowly and kind of surreally without saying anything until they got outside. Kurt and his dad were nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
“Dad, that was awesome!”<br />
<br />
“That was humiliating.”<br />
<br />
“I told him! And because of me he’s gonna get suspended! Hey, dad, I’m sorry I couldn’t come sooner.” He rubbed his dad’s hair.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Um…nothing. Hey, what’s wrong with you? That totally ruled.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t feel good, okay?!” Jake tried not to cry, but his bruises still hurt. “I got beat up by a bully today in case you didn’t fucking notice.”<br />
<br />
Aaron stopped cold. “How…you aren’t too hurt are you, dad? Man, did I really…I mean, you take a wallop today?”<br />
<br />
“Just my rib hurts a little. When he slammed me. I punched him pretty good, though. I just feel like I’ve gone through a heavy workout.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that reminds me, my boss wants me to go to the gym.”<br />
<br />
“You mean, my boss. Why?” Aaron filled him in on his dad’s new hot job prospects.<br />
<br />
“They want me to model, too? And be more of a spokesperson? That’s unexpected. But, looking at me from this vantage point I can see why. I am pretty impressive, aren’t I?”<br />
<br />
“Well you are when you’re in this body, yeah dad. Jeez, didn’t you ever notice?” Aaron leapt up to grab the top of a bar on the mini sun shelter arcing across two hallways. “Wow, I could never reach these before! I keep doing that, I’m so tall now!”<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait until we get back.”<br />
<br />
“Aw, it’s only a few more days.”<br />
<br />
“It’s four more days. FOUR. I am not doing this again. I’m not coming back to this school!” Jake said, making Aaron laugh. The forcefulness of a kid saying something like that was just too funny.<br />
<br />
“But dad, you have to now.”<br />
<br />
“Call in sick for me.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, your sister told them you weren’t sick.”<br />
<br />
“Crap. That interfering wench! Alright, I’ll consider it. I don’t want to get you into trouble, but this place is a nightmare. I forgot how…well, I guess I owe it to you. It isn’t easy being so…you know.”<br />
<br />
“Little?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.”<br />
<br />
Jake was silent on the bus ride home. “You want some ice cream?” Aaron asked as they both saw a Baskin Robbins. Jake looked up at his son with a grimace like ‘you’ve got to be kidding’. “What?”<br />
<br />
“No, I don’t.”<br />
<br />
“I do.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t.”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, it’ll make you feel better.” Aaron rubbed Jake’s hair. <br />
<br />
“Why do you keep doing that?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno. Just was trying to comfort you, I guess.” <br />
<br />
The bus home didn’t take long. Aaron really enjoyed being so much bigger in the bus seats. His head came above the actual seat! He felt like such a big boy! He smiled continuously, and then looked down at Dad. He could feel Dad’s pain. <br />
<br />
“Hey. It’s tough, I know. It’s hard being small. I love you a lot, okay?” He held his father protectively with an arm, and his dad allowed him to rub him gently on the arm. He cradled his dad the way his dad had cradled him whenever he got bummed out. He kissed his father on the head and smiled. <br />
<br />
Jake was shocked at how mature Aaron was sounding. The magic was definitely affecting their behavior but he did feel shitty and Aaron was comforting him. He let him. He leaned against Aaron’s new huge body and felt the fabric of his son’s big suit. He closed his eyes and his son held him gently. It was so nice to be held. It was nice to feel protected for once. And Aaron had protected him! That big bully had tried to hurt me, he thought with dull pain. He tried to make it seem like I did something but my Daddy came right away and told him off! <br />
<br />
Wait no…what am I THINKING? But instead of pulling away he just felt like crying more. He was actually thinking of Aaron as the father in the family. That was wrong. But Aaron was absorbing things because of the magic. He couldn’t stop feeling like just a kid again. He felt vulnerable and he wanted this big man to take care of him. <br />
<br />
He was scared by that but it was so comforting that this big man with a big man’s face was looking out for him. It made him feel loved and special. I guess that’s the way Aaron feels about me, really looks up to me and depends on me. I forgot what it was like to depend on a grown up for help! He’s really doing a good job of being me. <br />
<br />
“I love you, kiddo.” He told his son in a muffled voice. <br />
<br />
“I love you, too…kiddo.” Aaron whispered back. <br />
<br />
“I had a bad day,” Jake said. He sounded so much like a little kid that just wanted a daddy. <br />
<br />
“I know you did, buddy.” Aaron kissed his father on the top of the head again and then held him fiercely with both arms as his dad started to tell him about his day at school…<br />
<br />
<br />
Jake and Aaron got home and Aaron plopped down on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Man, dad. I’m hungry! Would you mind if I went out tonight? I’ll make some dinner first and then head to the gym.”<br />
<br />
It was really strange for Jake to hear his son sounding progressively…more independent. Without someone there to guide him everywhere. He seemed to handle it better than he had conceived. <br />
<br />
“I guess that’s okay.”<br />
<br />
“Great. I’ll make some eggplant parmesan.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh. Eggplant?”<br />
<br />
“You like eggplant, dad.”<br />
<br />
“Not now that I’m in a little kid body. Now all I want is sweets and fried food. Do we have any…?” He stopped himself.<br />
<br />
“Any ice cream?” Aaron smiled and took off his tie. “We do, but you don’t get any until after dinner. Now go wash up, you’re a wreck. And take some children’s aspirin if you need some. How’s the pain feeling?” Aarons said, taking out cooking instruments. <br />
<br />
“It’s feeling better, actually. I forget how quickly you can heal being a kid.” Jake was in the bathroom before it hit him that something seemed strange, but he wasn’t sure what. The next hour progressed as his son made dinner for a change, and he ate it grudgingly, looking forward to dessert. Aaron poured himself a beer into a glass while Jake had KoolAid, which was fine with him since KoolAid rocked. Aaron got his gym gear ready and before he knew it he was out the door. Jake felt something gnawing at him. Watching TV, he found himself veering away from the news so he could watch family sitcoms that he wouldn’t normally watch, when it hit him. He hadn’t been given permission to do something by his son. And he had gone along with it. He felt a chill go down his spine. What exactly was happening to him? He replayed it in his head. Why shouldn’t he be able to eat ice cream whenever he wanted? HE was the one in charge of this family, after all. Not his son. Him. This was only temporary. Why would he just let Aaron take charge like that? Without even saying anything?!<br />
<br />
He cuddled up into a blanket and said a silent prayer that tomorrow was Saturday and that neither one of them would have to deal with school or work.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, at the gym, Aaron had tried out all the machines. Today he went for the barbells. Wow! I can lift so much weight now! I can bench press 200 pounds on a bad day, he thought giddily. He’d occasionally gone with his dad to the gym, but only briefly. This time he was the one lifting big amounts of weight and flexing his muscles. He loved looking at himself in the big mirrors now. Curling 90 pound dumbbells. Is it supposed to be this easy to lift this much? Wow! I’m like Superman! <br />
<br />
Originally, he didn’t automatically know everything. He had to adjust the weights as he could lift them per machine, and often had to look at the side instructions. But it all came to him a lot easier than he thought it would. An hour into each workout he’d done, he was totally pumped and sweating. He ended the session with some cardio on the running machine. Walking there he noticed a few stares. Did he have something on his shirt? He rubbed a sweaty pec. No. They’re staring at me because I’m so fucking hot and they’re fucking jealous. They wish they could be this huge. He noticed a few guys looking at him and purposefully strode around the room trying to spot the guys that followed him with their gaze. He smiled to himself. This is fucking hot. They all want me.<br />
<br />
After his gym workout, Aaron took a bus back to his neighborhood. In the corner store he stopped for some eggs and then remembered he was almost out of beer. He picked out some Guinness and some Sierra Nevada ale (which he really liked the taste of, though he couldn’t remember ever having it). He got up to the counter and spied something. He added. “And uh…I’ll uh…take one of those cigars. And a lighter.”<br />
<br />
“Which ones, the Romeo y Juliets or the Montecristos?”<br />
<br />
“Man, you have the higher end cigars.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I got the cheap stuff too, but I can tell you like the good stuff.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll take a Montecristo. I’m treating myself. I just got promoted tonight.” Aaron smiled and handed over the money. Aaron walked with his new prize and felt so giddy he could barely contain it. I’m an adult, he thought. And I can buy cigars. No one will stop me! I didn’t even get carded! He rubbed his stubble proudly and pondered. If dad was still awake he wouldn’t be able to smoke this thing. It was funny, but he didn’t know anything about cigars except for that they smelled funny. Now he took the precious thing out of its wrapper and smelled it. Mmmmm! It smelled so good! Better than he thought, so much so his cock started throbbing. Let’s see…how does dad do this? His dad only smoked them once in a blue moon. But for most of the day Aaron had been thinking about this. This might be his only chance to do it. He sat down on the steps before his apartment building. He chewed off the bit end with his teeth. Kind of gross but he spit it out and smelled the tip. Now his mouth was watering. He put his mouth around the end of the cigar and wished he had a mirror to pose in. He tasted the end, and the taste of it was such a mix of the aromatic and forbidden. He savored it, sucked it a few times. When he took it away, his entire mouth was tingling from the sensation of it! <br />
<br />
Slowly, he lit the cigar. At first nothing happened, but then he remembered that you really have to work for a cigar. He sucked and sucked and sucked. Finally…smoke came pouring out of his mouth! He nearly gulped it down and gave a cough. The end was lit now! He drew some smoke in and blew. This was so unreal. Two minutes later, he still couldn’t get over it. He was actually smoking! He had never smoked before. It was so natural, though. He smiled and smiled, enjoying it for all the sensations it was giving him. Eventually he finished it, and stubbed it out on the steps. He was getting to do all the things real men did, and he was glad. He would have to go back to being a kid next week, so he might as well live it up.<br />
<br />
Inside the apartment, his dad had fallen asleep while an episode of Saved by the Bell played on TV. Aaron smiled. That was probably what dad watched when he was a kid. Maybe he was just having fun being a kid, finally. Aaron got inside his dad’s room and shut the door. He got into bed and took off his clothes and started stroking his man meat. He still couldn’t believe the sensation of pleasure and satisfaction it gave him…to have such a huge cock! His dad must sure miss it. He kept it hard for a while, and then flipped through some porn mags he’d also picked up. The guys all had huge dicks and some of them were having sex. Aaron had never seen anyone having sex nude before. It made him beat off all the more furious. He came, and wiped it up with a washcloth. He walked over to the dresser and looked for a towel. His hands came upon a box buried by socks.<br />
<br />
A box of cigars. <br />
<br />
Proudly, he took one and smelled it. Delicately, he held it in his hands and walked to the bathroom and looked at himself holding it, then chewing it, posing with it in different ways. Finally he couldn’t take it any more and he stroked off. He got down on the floor of the bathroom so he could masturbate furiously once more. <br />
<br />
By the time he was done he was wet everywhere with cum. He showered and felt orgasmic relief ebb away. He had just whacked off four times and he still felt pumped. He dried off, brushed his teeth and gargled with mouthwash. Hopefully dad didn’t notice the cigar smell but if he did it was all good. Dad smoked them, so it was alright for Aaron to as well. He could do anything his dad could do.<br />
<br />
Maybe some things he could even do better, he thought before falling asleep.</p>
