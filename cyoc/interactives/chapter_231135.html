<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna walked at a fast pace as she left the administration building.   When she turned a corner and was out of a direct line of sight from the building, she started running as fast as she could.  She ran up the stairs skipping every other step and slapped her keycard against the door lock.  It lit up green, buzzed, and she opened it as quickly as she could and entered the room.<br />
<br />
As Kylie had described, Anna found her shirts missing from the desk.  &quot;Mark?!&quot;  She ran to the dresser and opened drawers until she found the one with her shirts.  She heard a noise behind her and turned around and looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna!  I’m in here!&quot; shouted Mark.<br />
<br />
Anna ran back to the desk and looked in her purse.  Mark peeked out at her.  She reached in and pulled him out.<br />
<br />
Anna was almost in tears.  &quot;Oh, my god, Mark!  I’m so sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it’s okay,&quot; Mark replied.  &quot;I’m fine.  I was worried I might be discovered when she started picking up the shirts, but I dove into your purse and hid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long were you in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark told the tale.  &quot;She unpacked put her stuff away right after you left.  After she finished her own stuff, she put your shirts away, so it wasn’t long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna petted Mark’s fur.  &quot;I’m so sorry!  Do you need food or water?  Do you need to pee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I’m good.  I ended up sleeping most of the time I was in there.&quot;  He noticed Anna glance at her purse.  &quot;Don’t worry, I didn’t pee or poop in there.  I don’t know how Nibbles was, but I can assure you that I’m quite toilet trained.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna laughed.  &quot;Well, it’s dinner time for me.  I’m going to go to the canteen to get dinner.  Kylie is waiting for me.  You’ve got roughly an hour to do whatever and then she’ll likely come back with me.  Then we’ll have a little over an hour until we can use the medallion to change you.  Do you want to stay on the desk or go into a drawer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark considered his options.  &quot;I’ll take the drawer if you can put the food and water in there too…and the poop bag just in case.  Leave it open a crack so I get some light.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna moved him into the shirt drawer and got him set up.  &quot;Are you sure you’ll be okay?  I can go get my dinner and bring it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark gestured toward the door.  &quot;No, shoo!  Go off to dinner.  I’ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna headed off to the canteen.  Nearly everyone already had their food, so there wasn&#39;t much of a line at this point.  She picked out her dinner from the remaining options and carried her tray to Kylie’s table.  Sharon and Abby were also seated at the table, but they left an open chair for Anna.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, tell us about this &#39;Jennifer&#39; that’s apparently going to be rooming with me,&quot; asked Abby as Anna sat down.<br />
<br />
Anna took a sip of her drink as she thought for a second.  &quot;Jen and I were in the same cheerleading squad in school.  She’s pretty tall and blonde.&quot;  Anna decided to give her some of Mark’s personality since the plan was for him to embody Jennifer in a little over an hour.  &quot;Even though she’s a cheerleader, she’s a bit of a nerd.  She knows a lot about computers and likes to watch sci-fi shows and anime.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last item got Abby&#39;s attention.  &quot;Oh, does she like Sailor Moon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna shrugged.  &quot;Probably.  I know I’ve seen her playing Pokémon Go.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they continued dinner, they caught up on what they had been up to over the last year and what they were looking forward to at camp this summer.  Following dinner, the camp had scheduled an opening night party.  The others at the table were looking forward to it, but Anna knew that Mark’s 12 hours would be up during the party and didn’t want to waste any time in changing him into Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I’d love to go to the party,&quot; Anna commented, &quot;but I’ve been giving tours all afternoon and I’m kind of beat.  Also, I’d like to be around to greet Jen when she arrives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that’s understandable,&quot; said Sharon.  &quot;I imagine she’ll be busy settling in tonight, but I’m looking forward to meeting her tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie stood up and grabbed her tray.  &quot;Well, I suppose the rest of us should all go get changed for the party.&quot;  She looked at Anna.  &quot;Ready to head back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna finished the rest of her drink and stood up.  &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
They said their goodbyes and headed back to their rooms.  Kylie walked back with Anna.  When they got to the room, Kylie immediately started changing her clothes.  Anna laid down on her bed and waited for Kylie to finish.<br />
<br />
Kylie had changed into a tight fitting black dress that showed a lot of leg and a fair amount of cleavage.  She put on a pair of black high heels and a silver pendant necklace.  She turned around and posed for Anna.  &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look great!  If there were any guys at this party, you’d never be able to get them to keep their hands off you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie looked at herself in the mirror.  &quot;I’ll have to wear this when we have a dance with the boys’ camp across the lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna nodded.  &quot;Yeah, maybe that Australian counselor is there again this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie hummed.  &quot;Mmmm, yeah.  I’d let that Aussie take a little bite of this Philly cheesesteak.&quot;  She slapped her ass and they both laughed.<br />
<br />
As she walked out the door, Kylie wished Anna a good evening and Anna told her to have fun.  As soon as the door closed, Anna got up from her bed and hurried to the door.  She quietly opened it and could hear Kylie’s heels clicking on the staircase to the right.<br />
<br />
Anna closed the door again and went over to her dresser drawer.  &quot;Hey Mark!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark emerged from behind Anna’s T-shirts holding a Cheerio like a doughnut.  &quot;Hey Anna!  Is it time to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked at her watch.  &quot;It’s almost 6:30, so we’ve got another hour.  Kylie and most of the camp are going to the opening night party, but I told them I was tired after giving so many tours and wanted to rest.  I also said that I wanted to greet Jennifer when she arrived.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you’re saying we’ve got the place to ourselves?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Anna confirmed.  &quot;I don’t think I’ll be making out with a hamster though.  Why don’t we watch something on my phone.  I’ll lay in my bed and you can make yourself comfortable on my chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds great to me!&quot;  Mark shoved the rest of the Cheerio in his mouth and held out his arms like a baby wanting to be picked up.<br />
<br />
Anna reached into the drawer and scooped up Mark with both hands and carried him to her bed.  She sat up against the headboard with a pillow behind her and her phone leaning against her legs.  She placed Mark on her chest.  &quot;Go ahead and get comfortable, but please no digging.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark adjusted his tiny body and settled into a soft spot in the fabric of her dress between her breasts.<br />
<br />
Anna started playing an episode of &quot;The Office&quot;.  They watched a three episodes and it was almost 7:30 before they knew it.  Anna turned off her phone and put Mark on her desk.  She walked to the closet and retrieved the medallion, being careful to only touch it by the attached ribbon.  She hung it from the desk lamp.<br />
<br />
Mark wanted to go over how this would work.  &quot;So I just need to touch this to something Jennifer wore last and I’ll become her?&quot;  He reached up and gave the hanging medallion a little spin.<br />
<br />
Anna looked down at Mark.  &quot;That’s right.  I need to…&quot;  Her voice trailed off.  &quot;Oh shit.&quot;  She collapsed onto the desk chair and put her elbows on the desk and rested her head in her hands.<br />
<br />
Mark was concerned.  &quot;What do you mean &#39;oh shit&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked up at the top of the window by the desk and covered her mouth while breathing heavily.  &quot;I was so focused on packing clothes for the new you and making sure I remembered to bring the medallion, that I forgot to pack Jennifer’s cheerleader uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but you’ve got other clothes for Jennifer, right?&quot; Mark asked.  &quot;I wasn’t going to wear the cheerleader uniform all summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I’ve got clothes for someone Jennifer’s size, but they’re new and have never been worn.&quot;  Anna pinched the medallion between her fingers to stop it from spinning.  &quot;If you touch this to one of those, your body will be modified to fit it, but you won’t be Jennifer.&quot;</p>
