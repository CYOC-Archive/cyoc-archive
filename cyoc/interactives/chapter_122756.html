<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter Talbot happily led Karen Yuletide to the dance floor. He even made a show of bowing before her as the werewolf disc jockey was bantering between songs.<br />
Karen, staying in costume character as Cinderella, smiled and curtsied as the opening notes of Bryan Adams&#39; &#9835;Have You Ever Loved A Woman?&#9835; began playing.<br />
Peter smiled and moved closer to his girlfriend, one hand around her waist while the other held her hand.<br />
Karen simply nodded her head before moving in time with her boyfriend.<br />
Peter thought the song&#39;s title was a stupid question. <i>Of course. I love Karen.</i><br />
<i>Then why haven&#39;t you told her so?</i> an inner voice asked.<br />
<i>It&#39;s a big step,</i> he silently replied. <i>I don&#39;t just love her, I want to marry her and spend the rest of my life by Karen&#39;s side.</i><br />
<i>Well, you know she feels the same way about you. All those drawings of her&#39;s proves it,</i> his inner voice said. <i>If not tonight, ask her soon, or you&#39;ll regret it the rest of your long existence!</i><br />
<br />
Peter knew his subconscious, or whoever/whatever he was talking to, was right.<br />
He had talked to his father about this already and Leon Talbot, the werelion king of Moon Lake, had not only given Peter his blessing, but had helped arrange acquiring a token of his love for Peter to give Karen when he did ask the woman for her hand in marriage.<br />
Within one of the jacket pockets of the Prince Charming costume Peter was wearing rested that token now.<br />
He had seriously thought about getting Karen an engagement ring, but then realized that under the circumstances—considering at the moment that Karen Yuletide was still a normal human being and not a were anything—that there was something much more appropriate to show her how much he loved her and would be dedicated to their life together.<br />
Inside that jacket pocket was a bottle of werelioness birth control pills.<br />
What Peter thought made it truly special and a token of his love was that the prescription was made out to Karen TALBOT, not Karen Yuletide.<br />
<i>Now if I can only work up the nerve to ask her,</i> Peter chastised himself.<br />
<br />
&#9835;To really love a woman...&#9835; Karen heard Bryan Adams sing as she continued dancing with Peter.<br />
<i>I do love him,</i> she knew, staring at him, <i>and I know Peter loves me. Sharing him with others, like a male lion collects a harem, regardless of if they&#39;re mundane or were, that&#39;s the part that I&#39;m still concerned about. Yet to be with the one who is literally the man of my dreams...</i><br />
With Peter being slightly taller than her, Karen laid her head upon his shoulder the best she could as the song continued.<br />
<i>I&#39;ll say YES to you in a heart beat Peter Talbot. All you have to do is ask...</i><br />
<br />
As the Bryan Adams song ended, Peter Talbot and Karen Yuletide stood on the dance floor, looking at each other.<br />
&quot;Karen...&quot; he began.<br />
&quot;Yes Peter?&quot; she asked, staring at him.<br />
&quot;I—&quot;<br />
&quot;HEY COUSIN PETER!&quot; two female voices called out simultaneously, interrupting the moment.<br />
The couple looked around and saw Joy and Ife Talbot approaching them.<br />
Both of Peter&#39;s nieces were in their werelioness fursonas and dressed like <i>Wonder Woman</i>*, sort of.<br />
Joy, being the older of the two, was wearing an outfit that reminded Karen of how Lynda Carter looked during her television show in the 1970s, while Ife&#39;s costume was closer to how the character was depicted in comic books today.**<br />
&quot;Well, look at you two,&quot; said Karen. &quot;A couple of beautiful <i>Were Wonder Lionesses.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. We pretty much wound up having the same idea for Halloween this year,&quot; said Ife, while staring at her older cousin. Being the younger of the two, Ife was a bit jealous, not thinking she looked as good as Joy did.<br />
&quot;I know that look young lady,&quot; said Peter cautiously, catching Ife stare at Joy. &quot;You are both beautiful, as anyone would tell you.&quot;<br />
Ife looked at Peter in surprise as Karen added, &quot;Besides, the character is about a lot more than outer appearance. She represents inner strength, beauty, and wisdom as well,&quot; she pointed out.<br />
&quot;I know, but sometimes...&quot; began Ife.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s tough being a teenager, no matter who you are,&quot; Karen said. &quot;My own awkward years certainly lived up to their name, and they weren&#39;t that long ago for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; said Joy. &quot;Just because I&#39;m a senior, I&#39;ve got all this pressure on me from everyone about my grades, what I want to do after high school graduation, who I am or not dating—let alone why...&quot;<br />
&quot;All very important stuff,&quot; Peter reminded her.<br />
&quot;Yeah. But I just wish people would tell me something I don&#39;t know, like the answers to some of those questions,&quot; complained Joy.<br />
&quot;Just give it time. It will all work out,&quot; said Karen, while glancing at Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re sorry to interrupt,&quot; said Ife, apologizing. &quot;It&#39;s just that we saw you out on the dance floor, and thought we&#39;d say hello.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. You have,&quot; said Peter, as he started leading his relatives off the dance floor, with Karen following behind him.<br />
&quot;Did you ask her yet?&quot; wondered Ife, which received a dirty look from Joy, which is quite scary to see a werelioness do. Then Ife realized, &quot;OOPS! Oh, no. You haven&#39;t. Otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t be trying to get rid of us so hard.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Time for us to go,&quot; said Joy, as she started trying to push her younger sibling away from Peter and Karen.<br />
&quot;Ask me what?&quot; Karen said to Peter, hoping it was what she was expecting him to do.<br />
<br />
Peter Talbot looked around.<br />
He knew he was within the relatively wide open space of the Moon Lake High School Gym, but it felt like the walls were closing in around him.<br />
He could feel his heart beating more rapidly in his chest as Karen stared at him.<br />
If he didn&#39;t know better, Peter Talbot would swear he had broken out in a cold sweat, which he had.<br />
Then, after taking a deep breath, Peter took both of Karen&#39;s hands in his before getting down on one knee before her.<br />
His girlfriend was actually beginning to cry as Peter started to say, &quot;Karen Yuletide, would you—&quot;<br />
<b>&quot;YES!&quot;</b> she shouted, before jumping into Peter&#39;s arms.<br />
The momentum of her leap knocked Peter to the gym floor, landing on his back.<br />
But that didn&#39;t matter as the happy couple wrapped their arms around each other and began to kiss like there was no tomorrow.<br />
Joy and Ife Talbot just stared at each other for a moment, and then began cheering as the rest of those gathered in the gym for the Halloween dance began to realize what had just happened and started cheering and applauding too.<br />
