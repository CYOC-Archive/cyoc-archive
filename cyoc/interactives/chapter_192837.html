<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Kerry’s changes reached her throat, she grew an Adam’s apple and her voice changed. About the same time her shoulders widened and she just felt powerful. She was no longer a weak female. She had a man’s body even if she still had her own female head. She was now slightly taller than Kate. She knew she would not get much taller, Tom was only a short man, she wouldn’t even grow to the height of Jasmine, however she still felt powerful.  <br />
<br />
Kate had made her put on a pair of Tom’s boxers after the ejaculation incident. She had gladly covered up the offending organ that had embarrassed her. But that was all the clothes she had on. She no longer had an hourglass shaped body. She was more of a vee shape. Her shoulders were her widest part. Kerry was also grateful Kate had thought of making her the trim version of Tom. She was glad she didn’t have the spare tire around her stomach. This body wasn’t that of a muscle builder but it was fit and the muscles she did have were way bigger than anything she had previously possessed.<br />
<br />
Kate too was thinking that the football boots had been a good idea. She certainly preferred this trim version of Tom. She hadn’t actually realized how much weight he had put on. Maybe she could convince Tom to keep this version of his body when he and Kerry swapped back? She admired Kerry’s flat stomach. You couldn’t say Kerry had a 6 pack but you could make out the muscles. She couldn’t help herself. She reached across and stroked that trim belly.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” Asked Kerry with her now deep voice.<br />
<br />
Kate withdrew her hand quickly “There was a bit of fluff on you” There had not been but Kate had to think of something to explain her touching of Kerry. She looked at Kerry’s face. She was growing whiskers on her chin. Long whiskers, Tom had clearly not shaved for several days when he had last worn those boots. “You will need to have a shave”<br />
<br />
“I was thinking that myself” said Kerry as she rubbed her hand on her chin “I’m really prickly”<br />
<br />
“It won’t be long now before your eyes change. Then it will be hard to think of you as Kerry”<br />
<br />
“Best to start calling me Tom now. You don’t want to accidently call me Kerry tonight”<br />
<br />
Kate stuck around to watch Kerry’s face change. Her face changed from the feminine features of her sister-law to the familiar features of her husband. Initially her husband with long dark hair but that soon retracted into his scalp. Kerry had now moved way beyond the point where Kate could think of him as a she. <br />
<br />
“I had better start getting myself ready. I’ll use this shower. You take yourself to the other bathroom and start shaving while your change finishes. I’d suggest a shower as well” Kate handed Kerry Tom’s shaving cream and a razor “Take your pick of shirts from that wardrobe and wear the wedding suit. We can choose a tie and shoes later”<br />
<br />
As Kerry was walking through the kitchen she heard a phone ping. It was Tom’s phone. She looked at it and saw it had received several messages from ‘Kerry’<br />
<br />
Kerry picked up the phone. If ‘Kerry’ was sending messages it had to be Tom and if she was sending them to this phone then they were intended for her. Kerry used his fingerprint to unlock the phone. <br />
<br />
It seemed Tom wanted to know when they were going to swap back. Kerry became aware that they had not actually discussed that. He replied “No hurry, Use the excuse of returning the pearls. Maybe about 9” His fingers were so much bigger. It was hard to type the letters out correctly first go. He sent the message.<br />
<br />
The reply came swiftly. “The football won’t be finished by 9. It will be at least 11.30 by the time we are back home”<br />
<br />
Kerry replied. “I meant 9 in the morning”<br />
<br />
The reply was almost instant “You expect me to stay the night?”<br />
<br />
“Why not? I can’t think of an excuse for either of us to visit in the middle of the night”<br />
<br />
“Because I would have to sleep with Michael!”<br />
<br />
“No problem. Just tell him you’re not feeling well. He will leave you alone”<br />
<br />
In the taxi Tom felt like swearing when she got the last reply. Clearly Kerry had no intention of changing back before morning. Kerry expected Tom to sleep beside Michael. That was easy for her to say. Kate knew about the swap. No doubt Kerry would sleep in the spare bed. Easy enough for her. Tom began texting back “I’m going to have to tell Michael” <br />
<br />
The reply came quickly. “Suit yourself. I have to start getting ready. We can talk later”<br />
<br />
Just then the taxi pulled up.</p>
