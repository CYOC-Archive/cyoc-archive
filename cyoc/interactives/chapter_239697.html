<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny stared at her reflection in stunned disbelief, her chest tightening as reality slowly sunk in. The face staring back at her wasn’t hers—it was Jake’s. Not Jake as he was now, her 16-year-old twin, but Jake as a little boy. His messy blond hair, round cheeks, and bright, mischievous eyes looked back at her from the mirror. She felt her stomach churn as she realized she wasn’t just looking at her brother’s younger self—she was her brother’s younger self.<br />
<br />
Her heart raced as she looked down, taking in her small frame wrapped in the scout uniform. The shirt felt too stiff, the shorts awkwardly snug. She felt utterly foreign in this body, every movement reminding her that it wasn’t hers. And then, there was the weight between her legs.<br />
<br />
Jenny froze, a wave of dread washing over her. She didn’t want to look. She couldn’t. But curiosity and denial battled within her until, with shaking hands, she pulled at the waistband of her shorts and glanced down seeing now her small dick lying in the boxers she now wore limply.<br />
<br />
Her heart dropped. “Oh my God,” she whispered, her voice trembling. She slammed the waistband back and stumbled away from the mirror, nearly tripping over her smaller different feet. She didn’t just feel like a boy—she was one, and there was no denying it now.<br />
<br />
Her mind spun. How had her mom managed this? Why would she do this? And why did it have to be Jake’s body? Of all the people she could have been turned into, she was now stuck as her brother—a younger version of him, no less, complete with the dumb scout uniform he’d worn when he was 10.<br />
<br />
Fighting the panic rising in her chest, Jenny stormed out of her room, her new, shorter legs making her movements clumsier than usual. The doorknob, which had been at her waist just yesterday, was now at her eye level, forcing her to rieach higher to reach it. Everything felt off, unfamiliar.<br />
<br />
The smell of pancakes drifted upstairs as she made her way down, her stomach growling against her will. Pancakes. Of course. They were Jake’s favorite, and now she understood why the smell was so irresistible in this body now.<br />
<br />
When she entered the kitchen, she expected to see her mom at the stove. Instead, she froze.<br />
<br />
Standing there, flipping pancakes with a calm smile, was a man she hadn’t seen in years. Her dead father.<br />
<br />
“Dad?” she croaked, her voice cracking as she spoke.<br />
<br />
The man turned around, his warm, familiar smile growing as he saw her. “Good morning, Jack,” he said, his voice deep and soothing. “All ready for the forest with your scout uniform on, I see. You look great.”<br />
<br />
Jenny’s breath caught in her throat. Her legs wobbled, and she had to grip the back of a chair to steady herself. It wasn’t possible. Her dad had been dead for eight years. But here he was, standing in their kitchen like no time had passed.<br />
<br />
“It’s really you,” she whispered, her voice barely audible.<br />
<br />
“Well, sort of,” the man said, kneeling down to her eye level. “It’s me, honey, but it’s also your mom. I know it’s weird, but I thought… maybe it’d be good for you and Jake to have your dad back for a little while. Even if it’s just me in his body.”<br />
<br />
Jenny’s lip quivered as the emotions hit her like a wave. The sight of her dad’s face, the sound of his voice, even the way he knelt in front of her—it was all too much. Tears welled up in her eyes, and before she knew it, she was sobbing.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sweetheart,” her mom said, wrapping her now strong, familiar arms around her. “I didn’t mean to upset you. I just thought this might help you both in a way. We all miss him, don’t we? I thought maybe I could bring him back, even if it’s just a little piece of him, so we could all spend some time together.”<br />
<br />
Jenny clung to her mom—now her dad—feeling a strange mix of comfort and confusion. The warmth, the scent, even the way he stroked her back—it felt like her dad. For a few moments, she allowed herself to forget it wasn’t really him.<br />
<br />
After a while, Jenny pulled back, sniffling and wiping her tear-streaked face. “Why?” she whispered. “Why do this to us? Why turn me into Jake? And why bring him back like this?”<br />
<br />
Her mom sighed, ruffling Jenny’s short blond hair in that familiar, playful way her dad used to. “Because I thought it would be good for you both,” she said. “You and Jake are always at each other’s throats, and I thought maybe if you could walk in each other’s shoes—literally—it might help. And honestly… I missed him, too, and to be onist this is helping me realize what kind of man he really was and helping me remember him as well.”<br />
<br />
Jenny swallowed hard, unsure how to respond.<br />
<br />
Her mom-now-dad smiled gently. “Now, how about you sit down and have some pancakes? You’re going to need your energy for today. Oh, and by the way…” He leaned in conspiratorially. “We’re going to learn what it’s like to be guys together. You know, father-son stuff. Like burping contests, scratching where it itches, and teaching each over how to do stuff. Sound fun?”<br />
<br />
Jenny couldn’t help but let out a watery laugh. “That’s gross, Mom.”<br />
<br />
“Dad,” her mom corrected with a wink.<br />
<br />
Jenny climbed into the chair, her feet dangling above the floor. She was about to protest again, but the pancakes distracted her. She started eating, realizing that Jake’s favorite food tasted amazing in his body, even in her current emotional state. She wolfed them down faster than she intended, and when she finished, her dad ruffled her hair again.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you go wake up your sister and explain things?” he said, smiling. “She might need some reassurance. And hey, if either of you gets out of line, don’t forget—I’m big enough to give spankings now!”<br />
<br />
Jenny stared at him, horrified and amused all at once. “You wouldn’t.”<br />
<br />
“Try me,” her mom said, crossing his arms and grinning in that all-too-familiar dad way.<br />
<br />
Jenny slid off the chair, muttering under her breath, and headed upstairs. She wasn’t sure what she was going to say to Jake—now in her body—but she knew they’d have to figure this out together.<br />
<br />
She pushed open the door to Jake’s room and froze. Sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at the mirror with wide, tear-filled eyes, was a small girl who looked exactly like Jenny when she was 9.</p>
