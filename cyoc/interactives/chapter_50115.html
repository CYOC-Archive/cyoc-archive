<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What are you?&quot; the dentist asked in a shocked voice as he looked at Jensen as the black furred wolf sat quietly in his chair, although most of his legs dangled way out over the edge.<br />
<br />
Jensen was also slightly surprised. Having people ignore his species and nudity was something he accepted, but to have the dentist recognize him was totally unexpected. Especially since he recognized Jensen by his teeth. His teeth were very different from what they had looked like when he was a human teen-aged girl... maybe he had done something  that made him stand out during his last known visit or he was simply a good judge of teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a wolf, that should be obvious,&quot; Jensen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a very masculine one at that,&quot; the dentist muttered, &quot;How did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's just say I ended up on the wrong end of a question,&quot; Jensen answered, trying to be cryptic, since he had left Isabelle in the waiting area. Having her rush in to use her turn would only make a mess.<br />
<br />
The dentist, however, seemed to be understanding and carried on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Jennifer, what can I do for you today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I go by Jensen now,&quot; Jensen told him, &quot;and I need this canine capped.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dentist gave Jensen nervous glance as he opened his mouth and pointed to the chipped tooth. The guess was correct that the tooth would need to be capped, but he was still struggling with the fact that they weren't human teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you want it to match...&quot; the dentist began nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;My other upper canine,&quot; Jensen explained, &quot;I kinda need it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ha,&quot; the dentist said nervously, &quot;You wouldn't mind me taking a mold first? Make sure that the cap is carved accurately?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as the job is done,&quot; Jensen answered, with a cringe, knowing that the stuff that dentists used to make molds of teeth tasted nasty.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabelle looked down to see the young boy who was apparently there to have a cavity filled. It would likely take a while for the dentist to finish with Jensen, so she had contented to reading some of the magazines they had laying out. The image of seven foot she-wolf flipping through various teen mags and &quot;People&quot; was enough to raise eyebrows. Isabelle also swore she heard someone say she should be reading &quot;National Geographic&quot;, but she wasn't going to let their gossip disturb her.<br />
<br />
What surprised her was that the boy had come right up to her and started a conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a werewolf?&quot; the boy asked again.<br />
<br />
Isabelle put her magazine down and brought her head down so that she was looking the boy in he eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would you do if I told you &quot;yes&quot;?&quot; Isabelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you here to bite people?&quot; the boy asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;My... my Alpha has not commanded me to, so no,&quot; Isabelle answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to?&quot; the boy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Isabelle answered and then blinked when the boy looked depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always wondered what'd it be like to be a werewolf,&quot; the boy commented and went over to where they had a pile of blocks for kids to play with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; Isabelle thought to herself.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think Zack will stop, cousin?&quot; Alexandra asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; Nicole answered, &quot;Manipulative people are just that. Manipulative. He'll likely find some way to get someone to agree with him. Which is why we have Nick running the search on how to bulk the others up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of Nick, you do intend to share your pervert with us, right?&quot; Ashley asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since when...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since earlier today,&quot; Ashley giggled, &quot;and if we're to keep our legs together around Zack... maybe we could open them for Nick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole hadn't really given that much thought. She had always found Nick's immature pranks and antics to be childish and she wished he would act his age, but yet, she had ALWAYS had an attraction to Nick. She just wanted him to be more mature. Now... now, her own wolf-hood was bringing that attraction out where she couldn't hide it anymore.<br />
<br />
But, as much as she wanted Nick to herself... she somehow sensed that he could easily outlast her, and in a sexually charged atmosphere he wouldn't likely stick with her with other naked wolf-women around. At least Nick didn't go sniffing around the Alpha Female or the twins.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will have to take turns,&quot; Nicole finally said after a few moments, &quot;and I ask that you let me go first.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
The process seemed to be taking forever as Jensen waited in the chair. The dentist started with a mold that proved he had a real canid there and from which he was now trying to replicate the fang that he needed capped.<br />
<br />
After a few moments he turned back to Jensen and began holding various tooth colored blocks next to the teeth he still had. After settling on one, he pulled out a syringe full of Novocaine and began to apply it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm giving you slightly more then what is normally expected,&quot; the dentist spoke as given your present size, I would think your body would burn through the normal human dosage.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a slight prick as the numbing agent was administered, and after a few moments, Jensen watched him leave the room, probably to get the tools needed to grind down the tooth. All he could do now was sigh again as he waited.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Martha turned the television off as the movie ended.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is enough television for now,&quot; Martha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go outside,&quot; Kevin urged, eager to get a chance to chase rabbits again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can see how many deer Marcine and Jack have attracted so far,&quot; Bart nodded, looking interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deer?&quot; Mr. P raised his head, looking very interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will be the pack's game herd and primary food source,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;it'll be a while though before they have enough numbers and we are not to hunt Jack and Marcine at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuts,&quot; Mr. P looked slightly depressed at that. Two deer on the property and he couldn't bring at least one of them down, &quot;but it did sound like good management. With over twenty wolves, two deer wouldn't last them very long, &quot;can they talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack and Marcine?&quot; Bart replied, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;There, done,&quot; the dentist finally spoke after what seemed like an eternity.<br />
<br />
Jensen looked at a mirror placed before him and the dentist raised one lip, as Jensen was still numb from the Novocaine. Jensen looked at the image and turned his head to see it from all sides. The dentist had done a marvelous job, and Jensen looked like he had his fangs back again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Jensen spoke as he licked the capped tooth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would avoid anything super sticky or hard for at least forty eight hours,&quot; the dentist spoke, &quot;just to make sure the glue hardens right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forty eight hours?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never capped a tooth as big as yours before,&quot; the dentist spoke, &quot;and one day you will have to explain how you became like this.&quot;</p>
