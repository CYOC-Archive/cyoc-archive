<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a few days, Being his friend Frank's Dad was becoming second nature to Kyle. Even work had gotten a little easier. Every day when he punched it at the bank, he knew why he was there: to get his little Frank through school and pay for college. Sure Frank was a handful sometimes, but at the end of the day it was all worth it.<br />
<br />
Friday morning, Kyle sucked his gut in in front of the bathroom mirror, then exhaled to watch his round belly push back out against his white undershirt. &quot;Man, I really let myself go,&quot; he thought. Seemed like not that long ago he was still a young bachelor. Not a lot of time in the day for working out once your a dad, he thought.<br />
<br />
He raised an eyebrow. Something about that last thought didn't add up. He thought about it some more as he rubbed his belly, examined the gray over his ears. What year was he born in. And who was Frank's mom, exactly? It made his head hurt.<br />
<br />
He massaged his temples and shook his head. He didn't have time for that kind of thinking. He had to get Frank up, and off to school, then he had to get to work. He brushed his teeth, turned on the coffe machine, and then entered little Frank's bedroom. The ground was covered in dirty clothes, toys, and baseball cards. He shook Frank's shoulders &quot;Hey pal, time to get up. Come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank twisted around and groaned. He buried his head in his pillow. &quot;I don't wanna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, pal. It's Friday, I'm not playing games this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't wanna go to school,&quot; Frank rubbed his eitht year old eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate school. It's boring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You kidding, buddy? School's easy. I wish that's where I was going instead of the office.&quot; Kyle tugged Frank up off his pillow. &quot;Come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;you like it so much, you go.&quot; Frank collapsed on his pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Kyle used his stern dad voice. &quot;I'm not playing around, pal. Get! Up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Frank muttered. He rolled out of bed and headed for his dressor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get dressed, buddy. Get yourself a bowl of cereal, I'm gonna grab a quick shower. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle headed for the bathroom. He turned on the foucest and let the water get hot.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Frank, dressed for school and poured himself a bowl of Corn Flakes. &quot;Man,&quot; he said. &quot;Dad has no idea how much easier it is to be a grown up.&quot; He took a spoonful of cereal and mumbled with his mouth full. &quot;I wish I could change places with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Kyle showered, he distinctly heard a strong giggling sound over the rush of the water. Frank must be up to something. He lathered up and washed his chest and belly. It would be nice to lose this gut, he thought. But he couldn't imagine how it was going to happen as a busy single dad. He envied Frank: young, energetic, thin, his life as a studly teen and young adult ahead of him. He suddenly wished he was a boy again.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen Frank's toes and fingers started to tingle. &quot;Woah,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel weird!&quot; He spasmed, and held his head.<br />
<br />
In the shower, Kyle felt just as strange, his limbs shook with a weird sort of electricity. The strange energy spread up his body, and as it past his groin he suddenly become highly aroused. His stiff cock sprang out from underneath his beer gut. &quot;Woah!&quot; He said aloud.<br />
<br />
Little Frank continued to feel just as funny. He couldn't quite explain it, but it felt both scary and fantastic. Suddenly his school clothes started to get tight against his body.<br />
<br />
Kyle watched in amazement as his beer gut started to shrink, his cock poking out further and further, until his entire paunch had receeded. &quot;Oh man,&quot; his legs felt weak. He slipped down in shower and slumped onto his butt. His hand reached for his throbbing manhood.<br />
<br />
Frank's clothes started to rip, he grunted, his voice getting deeper.<br />
<br />
Kyle pleasured himself uncontrollably as he watched his body get young, tight, and toned.<br />
<br />
Frank's pants popped open. His shirt shredded. He stood up. He was getting taller. Muscled. He ran his larger hands over his stomach and chest and watched as fine black hairs sprouted.<br />
<br />
Kyle moaned in ecstacy as he pumped his dick, he couldn't believe his eyes as his body hair receeded. His muscles smoothed out, and his stomach, chest, legs, and arms become scrawnier, smoother. He looked like a fourteen year old. As he continued to regress he felt himself getting closer to his finale. Sooner his little toes and fingers were pudgy and childish. His pubes were totally gone too, and he was staring down at the body of a smooth prepubescent boy. He moaned in pleasure as he climaxed. But nothing came out. The shower water splattered over him, and his face burned with shame.<br />
<br />
Kyle scrambled to stand up, and turned off the shower. He reached for an enormous towel and shrouded himself as he got out of the stall. Everything in the bathroom was bigger. He ran his hands up and down his smooth, hairless body, then looked up in the mirror and moaned in shock. A little blond haired boy's face peeked over the bathroom sink. He was a kid again. No older than Frank.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to be a kid again,&quot; came a deep manly voice. &quot;Looks like you got your wish &quot;dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle turned in shock. A tall forty something Italian man, with a thick black mustache and a round beer gut stood in the bathroom doorway. Shreds of boy's clothes hung loosely around his shoulders and thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank?&quot; Kyle blushed with embarassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; he said. &quot;And now that I'm a grown up again, I'm starting to remember some of what happened to us.&quot; He smirked.<br />
<br />
Kyle struggled to process what Frank meant. Part of him could recall earlier that week, when he and Frank were in their late twenties, just pals. But another part of him was sure he was little Frank's middle aged dad. And yet on top of that, he was staring up at big forty something Frank, and he was sure he was in actuality a little kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't try too hard to think about it little Kyle. I know it's easier to just accept that you're a kid again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man Frank.&quot; Kyle said. &quot;We've got to get back to normal. We have to fight this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Frank stooped down and put his manly hand on Kyle's bare shoulder. &quot;I just spent four days as a little boy under my buddy's care. You know what I want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Payback. From now on, kid . . . you call me Dad.&quot;</p>
