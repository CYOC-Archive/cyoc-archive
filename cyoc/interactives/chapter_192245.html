<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later That Day Larry Vikk Was Out When A Package Was Delivered Andrew Was Busy Studying So He Has Simon Go And Grab It Simon Obliges He Goes Out And Brings It Goes Into His Room To Open It And Sees What It Is... <br />
<br />
The Chronivac A Device Rumored To Be Able To Change Reality So Just As A Test To Confirm It&#39;s Legitimacy He Used It To Change His Jeans He Was Wearing Into A Pair Of Black Basketball Shorts And To His Amazement It Actually Worked <br />
<br />
Simon Then Thought With This I Can Make Sure Abbie And Become A Couple I Can Make Sure I Don&#39;t Screw Things Up But How Should I Go About This He Didn&#39;t Want To Change Himself If He Didn&#39;t Have To And Changing Abbie Was Out Of The Question No Way Would He Be Some Creep Forcing This Girl To Love Him Or Making It Impossible To Leave Him No What He Needed Was A Practice Date Where The Girl Tells Him What He Did Wrong After The Date So He Doesn&#39;t Screw This Up The Only Problem Was He Didn&#39;t Have Any Female Friends Who Were Close Enough To Do That, He Also Didn&#39;t Think It Was Wise To Go On An Actual Date To Ask Strangers How To Improve On His Next<br />
<br />
Simon Then Thought He Could Change Andrew His Best Friend For Years I&#39;m Sure He Would Be Glad To Do This Favor But He Was Busy With School Work<br />
<br />
Simon Then Thought &quot;I Should Ask Him&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon Went Out To Where Andrew Was Studying And Said &quot;Hey Andrew, I Need A Really Big Favor Can You Help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew Says &quot;Girl Trouble Again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon Says &quot;Yes&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew Says &quot;Can It Wait 5-10 Minutes I Really Should Finish This Part First&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon Said &quot;Yea It Can Wait, Let Me Know When Your Good&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon Then Went Back Into His Room And Began Making It So Andrew Would Turn Into A Female And For His Trouble He Raises Andrew&#39;s Iq<br />

<br />
Simon Set The Delay For 5 Minutes And Then Transformation Time To 5 Minutes As Well Simon Then Locked His Door Not Wanting To See Her Until She Was Ready So He Would Be Prepared <br />
<br />
5 Minutes later The Transformation Started  First His Hair Started Getting Longer Then He Felt A Pain In His Stomach He Got Up To Use The Bathroom But He Felt Himself Get Shorter While Standing Up When He Was Fully Up The Room Felt Wrong It Just Looked Really Weird When He Had Gotten Into The Bathroom He Could Tell He Was Maybe 4 Inches Shorter But That Wasn&#39;t What Was Noticeable His Face Was All Feminine When He Grabbed His Face He Could Tell His Hands Had Changed To Then All Of A Sudden A Massive Pain In His Chest Put Him On His Ass And On The Ground It Was Hard Not To Notice His New Boobs They Were Massive And In His Face <br />
<br />
He Carefully Stood Back Up And Examined Himself In The Mirror (Oblivious To The Fact His Clothes Have Changed) He Looked At Himself And He Was Female He Looked At The Mirror And Saw Himself Looking Exactly Like His Sister Only A Few Years Older He Then Thought Was She Always This Hot? It Took A Few Minutes To Register He Was Female To Realize That This Was Somehow Simon&#39;s Fault He Had Turned Him Into This Girl He Didn&#39;t Know How But He Was Gonna Fix It So He Stormed Out Of The Bathroom Tried To Open Simon&#39;s Door And It Was Locked So He Knocked <br />
<br />
When Simon Answered He Said &quot;WOW&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon Then Says &quot;That Favor Please Kiss Me&quot;<br />
<br />
That Is When Andrew Kneed Him As Hard As He Now Could In The Balls<br />
<br />
Simon Fell To The Ground <br />
<br />
Andrew Then Says &quot;I Don&#39;t Know How, Why, Or Whatever But You Are Turning Me Back Right Now There Is Not A World Where I Play Your Lovesick Girlfriend&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon On The Ground With The Device Says &quot;A Practice Date Is All I&#39;m Asking &quot;Cough&quot; I Really Like This Girl And I Don&#39;t Wanna Screw This Up, Please Andrew&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew Says &quot;I Don&#39;t Care Simon I&#39;m Not Into Guys So It Doesn&#39;t Matter I Won&#39;t Be Able To Tell You What You Did Wrong Because I Wouldn&#39;t Know, And Just For The Record I&#39;m Not Some Guide Book Because In Case You Haven&#39;t Noticed I&#39;m Single Not To Mention I&#39;m Super Busy Studying Because If I Don&#39;t Pass I&#39;m Gonna Flunk Out I Can&#39;t Waste My Time On You&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon Changes Andrew&#39;s Sexual Preferences To Male Fixing One Of The Problems He Then Gives Her Female Knowledge So Is Experienced<br />
<br />
Simon Says &quot;One Of The Things I Did Was Increase Your IQ I&#39;m Sure You Were To Distracted To Notice But You Should Be Smart Enough Right Now To Stop Studying And Get An A Think About A Question Or Something You Were Struggling With Before&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea Tries And Finds What Simon Was Saying True <br />
<br />
Andrea Reaches Out A Hand To Help Simon Up<br />
<br />
Simon Grabs Her Hand And While She Uses All Her Strength To Pull Him Up He Goes In For The Kiss It Was Only A Peck At Best Before Andrea Started Slapping Him Away And Says &quot;What The Hell Simon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon Says &quot;I&#39;m Sorry But I Really Need Your Help, Right Now Your Female And I Need Help I Love This Girl And Without Your Help I&#39;m Gonna Lose Her And I Can&#39;t Lose Another One So I&#39;m Begging You Please Help Me&quot;<br />
<br />
(Andrea When She Was Affected By The Sexual Preferences Change And Female Knowledge) (Her Thoughts)<br />
(Andrea Looks Down At The Idiot He Made Me Smarter That&#39;s Sweet I Can Help The Idiot Up I Guess, Damn Simon You&#39;re Heavy (Just Then Simon Kissed Her) Oh That&#39;s Nice...What The Hell Simon (Simon Says He Loves Abbie And Begs Her To Help) What The Hell Are You Thinking Simon Some Skank You Haven&#39;t Even Met Is Gonna Be Your One, You Know I&#39;ll Be Your One Simon I&#39;m Passed The Shock And Being A Girl Isn&#39;t Bad Plus Your Being Super Cute So I&#39;ll Help You Forget About This Bitch And Get Me A Boyfriend In The Process Your Certainly Not The Worst Option) <br />
<br />
Andrea Says &quot;Fine..., But If We&#39;re Gonna Do This I Wanna Do It Right So A Proper Date Where You&#39;ll Treat Me Like You Would This Abbie Girl And You Pay For Everything I Do While I&#39;m This Girl, And For The First Thing First Let&#39;s Work On Your Kissing It Needs Work&quot;</p>
