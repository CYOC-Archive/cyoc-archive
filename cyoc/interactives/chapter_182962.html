<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy and Jen were at the end of the table where they could see up the hallway towards the bedrooms. They both looked up when they heard the door to the study opening. They both gaped when they saw Nikki walking out and making the quick journey across the hall and slightly towards them before turning into the bathroom. Both immediately turned their attention to the real Nicki who had her back to the hallway - she looked more like Amy&#39;s little sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; said Jen. &quot;I could have sworn that was Nikki!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Nikki but it must be Eric! We have to check this out!&quot; Amy had already left her seat. Jen tugged Nikki&#39;s arm and the 3 girls hurried to the bathroom. They pushed open the door.<br />
<br />
They found the apparent Nikki looking at herself in the mirror. If this was Eric nearly everything about her had changed. She now had a womanly butt, spectacular legs and ample breasts which were shown off to great effect by the body hugging dress. The face and hair were 100% Nikki.<br />
<br />
The real Nikki was the first to speak &quot;You&#39;ve become me&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric turned around and looked at the short girl who had spoken. She had Amy&#39;s face and Jen&#39;s voice. &quot;Nikki?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was Nikki, but I guess you are now. You&#39;re so tall! And I&#39;m the one wearing heels!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess I was the winner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. We are all close to the finish but no-one has tossed the right number yet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So this could get even worse?&quot; said Eric indicating her own body<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse? What do you mean? You look magnificent!&quot; said Amy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m envious&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
Maureen and Belinda had now come to the door. Maureen said &quot;Come on girls. There will be plenty of time to examine yourselves once the game is finished. And that must be really close by now. It&#39;s your turn Amy&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a moment for Eric to realise the tall slim girl with Amy&#39;s face must be her mother and that made the short girl with the Dolly Parton figure his father. That made sense as they were still wearing the same clothes they had been wearing earlier<br />
<br />
She found herself curious about where they were up to in the game and followed the others to the dining table. She took the vacant seat between Jen and Nikki. <br />
<br />
Amy noticed how gracefully Eric walked and how she sat with perfect posture. She began to suspect that Eric had also gained Nikki&#39;s elegance however she decided to hold her tongue until she had further evidence. When everyone was seated she picked up the dice and tossed. She needed a 1 but tossed 2 and 3. Her token stayed where it was and the usual card flipped over. Amy checked it was the same card that had come out for every black square then tossed again. 2 and 3 once more. <br />
<br />
No-one noticed any changes. Only later did Amy guess she had gained Maureen&#39;s dancing ability.<br />
<br />
Jen picked up the dice and tossed. She needed 3 but tossed 1 and 4. Her token moved on one place to a black square. She tossed a second time. She found herself in a copy of the dress Nikki and Eric were wearing. Her jeans and blouse had disappeared.  <br />
<br />
Maureen picked up the dice &quot;Your turn Nikki&quot; she reached across the table and attempted to pass the dice to Eric. Eric was momentarily stunned. Eric realised that this was possibly not the only time she would be mistaken for her friend. She was rescued by the real Nikki taking the dice off Maureen.<br />
<br />
Nikki tossed. She needed a 1 but tossed 5 and 6. Her token remained in place and the usual card flipped over. Nikki tossed a second time. On close inspection she realised her underwear had changed. &quot;I have just gained a camisole! Nice&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will find you have a matching bra and French knickers as well&quot; Maureen informed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; said Amy. &quot;How come Nikki and Maureen got a copy of my underwear? Didn&#39;t Belinda change that feature when she landed on a red square?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She did&quot; answered Jen &quot;Maybe the declining was just for Belinda and doesn&#39;t apply to everyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did I decline pretty underwear?&quot; mused Belinda. &quot;I can&#39;t recall my reasoning&quot;....... &quot;Oh well. My turn&quot;  Eric could see nothing of his father in this young girl. Belinda needed 2 to win. She tossed 4 and 5. Then tossed a second time without looking at the card that had flipped over. This toss was 2 and 1. &quot;Anyone notice anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re slimmer&quot; suggested Nikki. You&#39;re breasts are definately smaller. They look more real&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were always real!&quot; said an offended sounding Belinda. &quot;But I think you&#39;re right. I must have got the slimness wish&quot; She passed the dice to Maureen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on dice give me a 1&quot; Maureen tossed. To her delight she rolled 3 and 1. &quot;Yay! I&#39;m the winner!&quot; Her token moved to the purple square. Maureen read the card that flipped over. &quot;Congratulations the game is now complete. The perfect body from every measure. Enjoy the prize till sunshine tomorrow. Touch your piece to claim your treasure&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on&quot; suggested Belinda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait. As soon as I touch my piece I&#39;ll change won&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what happened to me and Dad&quot; said Eric<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; asked a puzzled Belinda. Eric realised Belinda had no idea of who she actually was. <br />
<br />
However before Eric could probe further Maureen continued &quot;So what I&#39;m currently wearing will just disappear like Jen&#39;s clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what happened last night&quot; confirmed Amy<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don&#39;t want to risk losing this skirt and top. They are silk and quite expensive. So give me a minute&quot; Maureen left her seat and went to the bedroom where she was staying.<br />
<br />
Eric took the opportunity to talk to Belinda &quot;Do you know who I am. Belinda?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re..... Amy&#39;s friend.... Nikki aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um no that&#39;s Nikki&quot; Eric pointed at the real Nikki &quot;Though you can be forgiven for thinking I&#39;m Nikki. I certainly resemble her. I&#39;m Eric your son&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous! I&#39;m not a mother!&quot; Belinda rolled her eyes &quot;You&#39;re delusional&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Maureen reappeared. The conversation was forgotten. Maureen was clad only in a lacy black bra and french knickers &quot;We are all girls here. I decided to ditch my shoes as well they are comfortable favorites. Don&#39;t worry I should be dressed again as soon as I touch my token&quot; she giggled.</p>
