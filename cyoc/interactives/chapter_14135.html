<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“No Betty….no….if you'll let me…get…word in…… STOP SCREAMING YOU STUIPID BITCH!!! What are you looking at? I'm breaking up with my girlfriend, mind you own business. What, yea some ass hole giving me a look for screaming at you. No you did deserve that and…. Knock it off will you!!!!! This is not the first time you've ever been dumped.  Sorry it didn't work out but it's not about you, it's about me, isn't it? Yea that's right, me. I'm about to hit big and I don't need your baggage holding me back. Oh you can do better? Look I'm down town right now, I'll scoop some dog shit off the pavement and date that, and then we'll see who's doing better.&quot; <br />
<br />
Man what a nag. Makes herself available WAY too much and expects me to respect that enough to keep on dating her? Well, after tonight the Tony train will be moving at full speed and I need the girlfriend space cleared for the high ticket priced women who'll be coming my way soon.  She can do better?  Hell, I’m going to do the best.  Shit, did we ever take any picture together? Don't think so. Don't need her coming out of the woodwork in a few years when I start me move to Congress. <br />
<br />
One step at a time though Tony. Tonight's the appearance on C-SPAN with the amateur student activists. Losers one and all. Yea, this is going to be great. After years of black and queer so called student activist the public's going to get an earful of real political activism at work. They’ll find out the difference between ‘Activist’ and ‘Extremist.’ Gonna run circles around those others so they won't know what hit them. <br />
<br />
Got to look good though, although I can never look bad.  But yea, I could use a new shirt and maybe a haircut. Should be easy to get a nice dress shirt to match these pants. Couple of good places down the block. Don’t have time to make an appointment at my usual hair place, should have thought of that.  Maybe somewhere around here.  I'll try this place for the hair, don't see anyone inside except for the Barber. Probably could use the business. This is like…. A Barber Shop. I thought these had all died off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there. Good afternoon. Do I need to make an appointment? No, great. Then you can do me right now. Look, here's what I want. I want a haircut that doesn't look like a hair cut OK. Know what I mean? Everything needs to be tidy and in place but not so that it looks like I just came from here, got me? Let's go then. Hey mind if I read over these note cards while you work? The cloth’s a bit in my way, thanks.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hey who's that in the mirror? Why it's Tony Angelo, the take no prisoners shit kicker. Yea that's right. These dark good looks are going to make me stand out on camera tonight like a model. Don't think I'll shave again before the show. This day's worth of black stubble looks good.  My usual 5 o’clock shadow that hits by noon is looking just fine.  Looks seriously male. Maybe get him to fade the sides a bit so it stands out better. That tan's got me a bit darker than my usual Italian tan. I get too dark and I look like a Spic. Like my idiot roommate, Jamie.  Thank god he’s not too dark skinned for a Spic or my Mom would have freaked when she visited.  But this shade on me looks good. I AM the total package. Won't have to use make up like the last time. I swear that fruity make up guy kept digging his crotch in my shoulder while he worked. This Barber better not try that. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are there cards? Note cards, points and facts for this evening’s show.  You got a TV in here? No, man this is an old store. Well if you got cable check out C-SPAN tonight at 6. I'm going to be part of a panel of the new student activist and I'm going to set the place on fire. Why? When you hear the words &quot;student activist&quot; what do you think? <br />
<br />
Here, let ME tell you what you think. Hippies and queers and blacks, am I right? That's not me. I'm the new breed. I'm an activist for the Right. For the conservative voice on campus that has put up with too much of this left leaning shit. <br />
<br />
Examples of my work, where to start?  What I'm the proudest of is when that Mom of the dead gay kid came to campus last year. The one that had been killed a few years ago? She's going on and on about how it's the church that's making kids feel bad about being queer and how the church puts thoughts of that gays are evil into people's minds. Well, that's religious prejudice right there!! She's infringing on my rights as a religious person. They can't have her on without a balanced viewpoint. I got her banned from this campus and put all other campus's on notice that if they hired her to give a talk, we'd protest till they either gave one of our speakers’ rebuttal time, at the same fee of course, or cancel her engagement altogether. With all the free time she's going to have she should think of having another kid and trying to bring it up normal. <br />
<br />
Tonight’s my launching pad.  Once the show’s over I send out resume to every conservative organization I can find and sit back to take in the offers.  Might even get an agent to field all these offers.  I’ll finish up my last year of college and head off to a prime job just waiting for me.  What? Lean back? I don't want a shampoo I just need a haircut. Just – Cut – The – Hair, got it? OKOK what ever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Man this guy is persistent. But he's been here long enough so he must know what he's doing. I just like being the one calling the shots.   He's good at this though. The feeling of his hands rubbing the soap into my hair. Very relaxing. It's like if I stare at the ceiling I'm almost going to sleep.  Haven’t been this relaxed in years.  Proof that I’m on top of my game if I can be this cool this close to the biggest event of my life. That was quick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, a trim would be good. Got to look neat for tonight. Can you fade the sides of….. hummm. Guess you don't need too. I thought I would have a day's worth of beard showing now but I can't, oh yea, with the blonde hair it doesn't show up that much. I can have like three days growth and no one can tell unless you feel my face. Yea it's cool… but shouldn't I have darker hair? What? That's right, some Italians are blonde. Am I Italian though?  Yea. You gonna use those clippers on me. Good, yea, just a trim.&quot; <br />
<br />
Geez, those clippers are loud. Checking the mirror and he's doing a good job. But, is that right? Is he…? Look right there. He takes the end of the hair with the comb, but instead of just combing the hair, it looks like he's pulling the stands out of my head, like he's making them longer. Yea sure look. Short blonde hair, comb pulls out about two feet of blonde hair and he trims the end a bit. Comb. Long blonde hair. Trims end. Going around and around my head like that I'm going to have a full head of long blonde hair soon. But haven't I always? Sure yea. It just looks longer thanks to his washing and trimming it. Split ends gone and all that.  Don't mind trimming the end but he better not take any on the length off. <br />
<br />
And what's going on under this cloth? I thought I'd have little black…. No blonde, yea little blonde hairs on this clothe. Must be falling on the floor. They're not getting on my pants are they? Hey look, I'm not wearing pants. What the? I keep hiking the cloth up and all I'm seeing is legs. Man I've got great legs. Well I work out enough, it's my thing, and they should be good.  I’ll have to shave them tonight for tonight.  I love how the muscles spread out a bit when I sit down but all I've got to do is flex and BAM they pop right back into shape. Relaxed. BAM. Relaxed. BAM. Oh hey I'm wearing gym shorts. Gym short shorts more like it but at least I remember to wear them this time. Relaxed. BAM. Rleaxxxxed…….BAM. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sorry sir. Yes I'll cut that out so you can shave me. But you see how my leg muscles pop into shape when I flex them? My chest does the same thing watch.&quot; <br />
<br />
Good he's watching as I lift the cloth and reveal this chest of mine. Well it's under a spaghetti string tee but he can see my pecs clear enough. I buy the kind that reveals the most. But I was wearing this when I came into the shop wasn't I? So he would have seen my cheat and pecs then. But he didn't' see them do this! OH yea!!! Like balloons on my chest. I swear if I move just right. Pecs when flexed – man tits when relaxed. Gotta love the hang.  And these big pink nipples….<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry again, I'll stop. But cool huh?   OK for the face how about we save the side burns and the beard but lose the mustache and how about a little skin between the beard and sideburns?  Yea, I know, it’ll make me look a bit rougher but that’s what they need for tonight’s show&quot; <br />
<br />
Man I look really good in that mirror.  I kow I’m something of a muscle stud thanks to all my gym time but I don’t usually put that much into my looks.  Well, I need to for tonight, so I guess it’s OK.  The beard looks great in the shape he’s trimming.  Still wish it would come in a bit thicker and darker.  Dad’s Scandinavian roots keeping my roots bight yellow.  I’m only 18 so, maybe in time.  <br />
<br />
“The show I’m doing tonight?  Did I mention that?  Guess I did, but no, it’s not a TV show. It’s the car show.  I get to be some eye candy for one of the carmakers.  They’ve got me a knock off pro wrestlers outfit so I’m going to stand next to the car and play up its muscles.  See muscles and muscle cars.  Kind of cheesy but a great way to make some easy money in one night.  If my feet can last that long. That’s what’s on these cards, all the facts and figures about the cars.  Got to memorize as much as I can since there’s no where in the outfit they gave me to stash any cheat sheets. Yes I’ll put my biceps back under the cloth.  They’re pretty big too.  All done.  Let’s checkout the full package.”<br />
<br />
It’s amazing what a good trim can do.  My hair’s just about perfect.  I don’t think he used any highlights but the blonde looks almost white as it frames my face.  The back hangs down a bit past my shoulder blades but it’s perfect.  The face like he says looks a bit rough but I think my blue eyes shine out still giving me a bit of innocents.  Which is cool.  I don’t like people thinking I’m a bad ass or nothing.  I should have worn some type of underwear with these shorts though.  Popping a bit of a boner here in the store.  My big pink dick is starting to emerge from the leg of the shorts.  Guess I like the change more than I’ll admit.  And I admit to loving this.  Don’t think he’d mind if I…. Oh yea that feels nice.  Never can decided if I like the feel of my dick just after I work out and it’s all sweaty or after I take a shower and it’s all clean.  Maybe the important part is that I just like the feel of my dick. It does feel great though.  The precum is just enough for lubrication. It’s got the right color that I like, not too pale when it gets soft, not too red when it’s hard.  Just enough color.  The thickness is great, whose side of the family is this from?  Probably Mom’s. The circumcision was her Jewish side of the family, the blonde bush on top Dad’s.  I have to be more careful with my hands though.  They feel a bit too rough as I’m stroking here.  The calluses are becoming harder from all the workouts.  Don’t want to switch to those machines to do my muscle work though.  I’m strictly a free weight, solid iron man.  But I need my hands to be free and undamaged for my ….. oh here it come….. oh, yea.  <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry I’ll just…. Oh you’ll clean it up.  Well, sorry again.  Anyway, looks great.”<br />
<br />
Uh, oh., my necklace got tangled, better straighten it out.<br />
<br />
“Yea, I know, it’s not everyday you see both a Crucifix and a Star of David hanging from a chain but, Dad’s Catholic and Mom’s Jewish so, in this case, I swing both ways.  No I don’t consider myself one or the other but part of both equally. Why not?  It’s doable and leaves one mind open for all possibilities.<br />
<br />
 Hey, you don’t do body shaves do you?  I need to go smooth for the show tonight.  And not just my chest and legs!!   Kind of stupid but, the shorts they give me?  If there’s any hair on my ass or dick, it’ll show through.  Even though I’ll also be wearing a g-string.  So I have to go hairless from the neck down.  What’s this stuff?  Hair removers?<br />
<br />
I don’t know.  These have always been pretty harsh.  Can’t go in with chemical burns or rough spots. Yea OK I’ll give it a try back at the dorm.  Get a friend to help?  Yea I guess my roommate would be around.  He can help.  He’s also my buddy since I’m just a Freshman and he’s a senior grad student.  Political stuff that I don’t think he really believes but needs something to study on since he has no life outside of his classes.  He’s there to show me stuff and help out.  Don’t think he ever thought of this as helping out but…. I think he’ll be up for it.  Thanks for all your help.”<br />
<br />
Great job from that guy.  Got to keep going back.  OK, it’s… oh that’s right I don’t have a watch.  Well I think it’s around 4 so that gives me enough time to head back to campus and use this stuff.  Jeez it’s nice out today.  Look at all the flowers they’ve planted on the roadside.  The colors are great.  I should read up on the instructions so I’m all set to go once I get back to the dorm.  The label makes it seem real easy to use.  ‘Specially formulated for blonde hair.”, didn’t think they could get that specific. “Apply and wait at least one minute for hair removal at skin surface, up to 10 for deeper root removal.”, gee the longer I leave it on the longer it’ll take for the hair to grow back.  “Caution: Might have adverse effect on darker hair.”, it is specific ain’t it.  Should I call the room and see if Jamie’s in?  Ah I’m here already.<br />
<br />
“Jamie, thank god you’re here.  Yea, it’s really me.  You didn’t recognize me with my hairstyle so well, I bet.  Not the usual blonde mop.  Still the same old Dewey underneath though.  Look I need your help in the bathroom.  No seriously.  Remember how I told you for the car show tonight I have to get rid of my body hair?  Sure I told you.  Oh yea, it was the Barber I told that.  Anyway, I’ve got some stuff to use but I’m not going to be able to reach everywhere.  I’ve got to get ready for the show tonight and I have to use this stuff all over.  Come on I’ll show you.”<br />
<br />
Grab a towel, wash cloths, some soap, and shampoo, the hair got kind of sweaty running over here from the Barbershop.  <br />
<br />
“Jamie what are you checking under the stalls for, I don’t care if anyone else is here.  It’s a communal bathroom and shower and people are going to have to expect the unexpected some times.  You never come in here when the girls are shaving their legs?  Yea, yea.but this is the same thing.  Sort of.  OK, I can use this stuff on my front, I just need to apply a good coat.  But I’ll need you for the back.  Don’t go anywhere!!!  Please!!!  I can’t do this alone.  Thanks man, you’re the best.”<br />
<br />
Stuff feels cool, a little thinker than I’m used to but still creamy.  No bad smell like Nair and no overly feminine smell like the waxes I’ve got in the past.  Also doesn’t burn of tingle when I put it on, that’s good.  No burns tonight.  Let’s see, down my arms, shaving my arms is always the best.  Not everyone does it but it feels so cool against fabrics and sheets.  In the pits.  Sort of hate to lose the pit hair, I think that makes a nice balance but… they say it’s all gotta go if I want to be paid.  Into the crevice of my pecs and down the tummy, so long treasure trial to the navel.  And now the bush.<br />
<br />
“Grow up Jamie.  It’s what bodybuilders do. Yea I’m sure it’s what male strippers do to, but how would you know?” <br />
<br />
That feels great on my cock.  So cool and soothing.  Getting hard, got to be careful.  Jamie’s about ready to bolt and I don’t think he knows fully what I’m going to ask.  Down the legs, oh, those were easier to do than I though.  OK, check the mirror.  Yea looks like a good coat.  I look like I’m wearing a cream suit from my neck to my feet.<br />
<br />
“OK you’re turn.  I need you to do my back and ass.  Yes, my ass, it’s the most important part.  I told you I can’t have any hair back there.  I didn’t?  Oh, yea, it was the Barber I told that too.  But I can’t have any hair, it’ll show through the shorts.  You’re getting really sweaty man.  Do you want to take off your shirt?”<br />
<br />
Jamie looks good with his shirt off.  Wish he’d relax more around the dorm room.  I parade in almost nothing the second I walk in the door but he’s usually wearing the same thing he wears to class.  Not too defined but being Latino his skins got a nice honey brown tone which looks good no matter what’s underneath. <br />
<br />
“OK that’s my back now do my ass.  Jeez stop being so nervous.  I’m going to squat down so you can get some up the crack.  Oh come on, it’s just between us.”<br />
<br />
Am I wrong or is Jamie protesting a bit more than seems normal?  And for someone who didn’t want to ‘go there’ those hands sure are taking their time in that crack.  Sure feels nice though.  The smooth cream up and down the inner skin.  Long my asshole.  Did his finger just take a poke inside.  JEEZ!<br />
<br />
“Oh I’m sorry man I didn’t mean to jump back like that.  It’s just felt like your finger went into my hole there.  Oh man, I’m sorry I got some of that cream from my back on your chest when I jumped up.  I think I’m all done but I have to wait a few minutes.  Yea, you better wipe that off.  The bottle said it might have an odd reaction to hair that isn’t blonde.  I know, I’m sorry.  But your finger…  shit look at that…..<br />
<br />
Jamie, look where the cream was on you.  Look at all the hair.  Instead of taking the hair off you, it looks like it made it grow out.  That is so cool, yea check the mirror.  Yea I DO like it.  It’s kind of like you’ve got hair on your chest for once.  I guess you could shave it off but why, it looks good.  Here hand me the bottle…<br />
<br />
There should be enough in here for you.  Want to give it a try?  Want to see what you’d look like if you actually went through puberty and got body hair.  I’m kidding, I’m kidding but come on.  Drop the pants.  And the undies.  How wears underwear these days?<br />
<br />
Lets see how about we complete the chest down to the bush you already got.  And your arms but not the biceps area just from the elbows down.  And you hands.  Now your legs front and back.  Turn around.  Sure I’m going to do your ass.  Oh come on, you did mine.  OK if you don’t want a hairy ass that’s your GOTTA CHA!!!!  Yea were going to coat this rump but good man.  Want to know what that finger felt like?  <br />
<br />
OK OK, I’ll stop but, at least your laughing.  Look at us.  Two grown men standing in the bathroom covered in cream from neck down.  I think it should be safe to head into the shower.  Yea it works fast.  No, not that one.  Get in here with me, there’s enough room.  CAUSE I want to see what happens, dude”<br />
<br />
I’ve never seen Jamie this open up before.  Like he’s having a good time for the first time in a while.  He usually so serious with all his political studies.  That guy he used to hang out with was such a prick.  Don’t see why you have to go hatin’ when there’s so much more fun in being free and easy.<br />
<br />
That water is just about the right temp.  Not too hot, not too cold.  The cream is coming off some just by standing in it.  I should get the wash cloth and, what the.  Oh it’s just Jamie starting to use the cloth on me.  Yea, guy that’s it.  Wash away the cream and hair and lets see that skin.  So tone and tight.  Without the hair there’s even a slight tan to my skin now, that’s look good under those bright lights at the show.  My muscles look more cut, more defined too.  That really shouldn’t be happening just because my body hair is washing away.  Must be the stuff.  My dick looks bigger too, with the bush gone.  I see nothing but clear skin when I look down.  The balls are great without the fine wiry hair hanging of them.  Like they’ve gotten bigger and are hanging lower.  Have to get more bottles of this stiff.  Jamie really working that clothe.  He’s got good hands.  For a big guy he’s really tender.  I guess fully clothed like he always is around the room I guess I never noticed just how much taller he is than me.  And he’s back on my ass.  Taking his time again with that cloth.  I’ll spread em a bit so he can get in the crack again, oh, again, he’s doing that for me.<br />
<br />
“How’s it looking back there?  Nice huh?  Let’s get you cleaned up now.”<br />
<br />
I take the cloth but even before I start to rise the cream off I can see how well it worked.  The black hair now is swirling around in the mix of cream and water.  Long thick body hair, like a rug has grown on his chest.  A chest quite as big as mine but it’s still an impressive set of pecs Jamie’s got.  His nipples are now obscured by the hair that circles them.  You can’t even see skin in between the two pillow like muscles sitting on his chest.  The hair must be adding definition. But it it’s this long of hair, wouldn’t that hide some definition.  Oh well.  His breathing’s getting deeper too.  The legs are great.  Just the right hair length that you can tell this is a hairy man, but not quite too hairy.  Want him to come out looking male, not looking primate.  I spin him around and start on the back.  His ass is like a bubble now, a furry bubble.  Gonna have to pitch in for extra TP to get this baby clean.  I’m glad I didn’t put any of this stuff on his back.  He’s going to have enough trouble getting a swimsuit that fits over all this hair.  Having a real hairy back on the beach isn’t the look we should be going for.<br />
<br />
“This looks great man.  You look so much better.  Yea, from the Barber shop.  Let’s see the front again.  You’re skin even looks a little darker man.  No it’s not the hair, I think it’s just a bit darker.  See how mine’s a bit tanner than before, not quite so suburban pink?  Well you’re a bit more barrio brown brother.   Hey look at that dick.  I didn’t know you weren’t cut like me.  Hand me that shampoo. Yea, gonna wash this new hair of yours.  Starting down here.  Look at that smile.  You needed this didn’t you?  I know I did.”<br />
<br />
His prick is just getting bigger and bigger.  The colors getting darker and I don’t think that’s just thanks to the blood being pumped into it.  Good thing Jamie’s likes this change.  He’s needed to get the chip off his shoulder and start acting like…..a human being.  I doubt he even believed the stuff he used to spout to… who was that guy again, his old roommate?  I know it wasn’t me saying that shit.  And even when Jamie was saying it, it was almost like he was saying stuff just to be accepted, not being true to himself.  Well this smiling Latino sure looks like he’s pleased with who he is now.  Just took some fun times in the bathroom, but maybe the fun is only beginning…<br />
<br />
“So you want to….. Well.  You know.  Yea I’d like to give it a try.  But be careful.  This ass is pretty solid so I don’t want to snap it off when you go in.  Use the shampoo to grease it up.  You add any more cream to that body and we won’t be able to find you dick through all the hair.”<br />
<br />
He’s back with the finger but it’s being more adventurous this time.  Up to the first digit I think, no, that’s all he way to the second.  Unless he’s already starting to fuck me.  NO, NOW he’s starting to fuck me.  Oh yea!!!!  Oh feel that.  Man this is the best.  Why did I wait so long to have a guy do this?  Why don’t more guy get there asses fucked?  Who wouldn’t love cock in their ass.  On no, don’t pull out now.  Oh he’s only pulling back.  Man I’m getting hard too.  Having a dick in your ass and getting a hard on at the same time.  NEVER felt like this before.  Must be like seeing the face of god.  Easier to get a grip on myself without all that hair in the way.  Didn’t think he would feel this big.  But he is a good foot taller than me and his cock was proportional to…oh who gives a fuck about proportions at a time like this.  Good thing the water’s still going since I’m working up a sweat again.  Picking up speed.  Good thing he loosened me up a bit first cause…. Oh… he’s…. really… picking …. up .. the… tempo.  Oh yea.  I love how both of his hands have my shoulders in this iron grip.  Holding me still as he pounds away.  Just the best.  Big push in and….. the volcano has erupted.  That is an incredible feeling.  The hot cum shooting into my ass.  Didn’t think I would feel it that strong.  Oh man, I came too without even knowing it.  Thank god we’re in the shower.  <br />
<br />
Oh jeez he looks so spent.<br />
<br />
“You OK man?  Honey that was the best I ever had.” Hey he’s a great kisser.  Never thought of kissing right after sex.  This is nice.  Good lips on the guy.  “To tell the truth.  Jamie that was the first I ever had too.  WHAT!! You too!!!  But you’re 3 years older than me and have been here…. Oh the first guy on guy / guy sex you’ve ever had.  You bi?  No I don’t think your bi after tonight either.  Why did you never act on this before?  Because you thought no one would ever accept you for who you are, so you had to be someone you thought they’d accept?  Well I think my ass just did a pretty good job of accepting your real self right now stud and that never would have happened if you kept pretending to be someone you’re not.  We could have been having this much fun for the past two months instead of you hitting the books and me jagging off in the bathroom.   Me?   Small town boy from a small high school.  If I fucked around everyone would have known in minutes.  That’s why I came to such a big school so far from home.  Along with the great educational prospect…. Yea I’ll shut up and kiss you. <br />
<br />
Can’t believe we took each other’s Homo cherry.  That’s awesome!!  Look man, we’ve got to talk but I’ve also got to dry off, get dressed and get to the stadium.  No, I have to go, I really need the money, man.  But come with.  Yea, I can get you a pass and you can hang out till I’m done.  DUDE, wear my string T so I can see all that hair as you walk though the crowd.  Let’s see if you can make me pop a boner while I’m up on stage.  I’ll be done with the gig at 10.  We can go grab something to drink and talk about this cause, I think we’ve gone beyond the student rep and freshman dynamic.  Plus I can find out how drunk I need to get you before I can do the fucking.  None at all huh?  That’s encouraging.<br />
<br />
Maybe tomorrow after a night of great fucking we can head back to the Barbershop and make sure this stuff did what it was suppose to.  Could even get you in the chair to see if he can fix your ‘do now that he’s fixed the rest of you…”</p>
