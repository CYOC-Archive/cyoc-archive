<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’m glad that you could come so quickly, Eric” The zoo lady shakes the vet’s hand and smiles thankfully. “I’m just doing my job and my job is to keep the animals of this zoo healthy and strong…” Eric, the vet answers modestly. “What do we got this time?” Eric asks, putting his hands behind his back. “Well we got a newly transformed Newfoundland bitch, who doesn’t eat and ignores both me and her companions” “Well, then. Let’s have a look at her” The zoo lady begins to walk towards Nancy’s kennel and Eric walks next to her. They walk along a corridor of kennels, each one with 1-3 dogs of the same breed. Almost every one of them barks as they walk by. <br />
<br />
“Hey! What do you need to do to get some food here!? I’m hungry!” Barks a brown and red restless Australian Shepard. “Shut up! You must wait until the human says we’re allowed to eat. Understand? Besides, it wasn’t very long ago we got our morning meal, so you have no reason to be hungry, wimp” A German Shepard male taunts from the kennel on opposite side. This seems to make the smaller herding dog even angrier as he begins to show his teethes. “You wouldn’t have the guts to say that if you were in the same kennel as me” The German Shepard pulls his ears back and growls. “Oh, yeah?...” The bitch behind him watches his mate, even though she’s busy giving milk to her pups. She sighs. “David… stop acting so puppish and stop harassing that dog. I’ve met his bitch during one of the walks and she told me all about him. They seem to be such a nice couple” The male eases down a little and his ears straightens a little. “But honey… he’s taunting me, and I’m bigger then him…” He says between his clenched teethes. “I don’t CARE David, now lie down!” David growls lowly and lies down as he’s asked to do. The Australian Shepard male snickers and almost begin to jump up and down with joy. “You obeyed your bitch! You obeyed your bitch!” The Aussie male chants tauntingly. But this is abruptly stopped as he is pounced by his bitch. “What are you doing!?” He barks, both surprised and upset at his mate. “The same goes to you, Tim. Stop this nonsense” Tim tries to get up, from his current position as he’s lying on his side. “But Jenny… please” A sudden growl bark makes Tim roll on his back and pull his tail between his legs as his mate bite his throat loosely. “I’m serious Tim, you stop teasing that dog” Tim licks his nose. “Yes, of course. I understand” Jenny lets go and Tim gets up a bit awkwardly. He hears a loud laugh form the other side of the room. “Who’s obeying his bitch now?” Tim tries to ignore the dog and lies down in his dog basket next to his mate. She gives one of his ears a loose nip with her teethes. “I’m sorry if I where harsh on you, but I just don’t like it when you’re acting like that…” Tim lets out a low grunt as protest. Jenny looks concerned for a short second, but then she moves closer and begins to nuzzle her mate. “Well I can tell you one thing that will cheer you…” She whispers something in his ear and he lifts up his head and he opens his mouth to let his tongue come out. “Really? Are you sure?” He asks hopefully. She playfully nuzzles his ear with her muzzle. “Yes, I’m sure… I can almost feel them…”<br />
<br />
“Now let’s see what we got here…” Eric says to himself as he begins to use his hands to examine Nancy’s body. Both Riley and Joanne look curiously at Eric as he does his job. But Nancy doesn’t even look at Eric as he begins his examination, even when he opens her mouth to look at her teethes, she tries to look away. After a couple of minutes, Eric gets up again. “Well, I can’t find anything wrong with her physically.  But I think I already know what’s wrong with her. Even though I need to take some more tests to role out all other possibilities” The zoo lady looks a bit worried. “What do you think is wrong with her?” <br />
<br />
“Well I think she’s suffering from PTD or Post Transformation Depression as we usually call it. That’s when the transformed person body has changed faster then her mind can handle, she hasn’t really accepted the change yet. Has she done something very canine yet?” The zoo lady shifts her weight from her left leg to her right leg. “Well, she willingly mated with the male immediately after she woke up after she got taken here. It was after that she got like this” Eric massages his chin and nods as if he agrees to what she’s saying. “Yes, well that’s probably the reason. She’s in heat right? When she woke up, she wasn’t fully aware to what she was doing so she just followed her instincts. But then when she was satisfied, her human mind began to come back and then she realised what she has done. But her mind couldn’t handle the situation so now she probably feels pretty awful and depressed” The zoo lady looks down at Nancy with worry in her eyes. “Oh, poor girl… of course this has to be a real chock for her…” She faces Eric again “What can I do?” Eric clears his throat “Well… you have to let her take her time to adjust and show her that it’s a positive thing to be a dog. You have to change her mind so slowly that her new dog actions doesn’t become a chock for the human part of her mind”</p>
