<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly, he scanned the room and sniffed the air. Already, he knew what he&#39;d find, even before his acute sense of smell and hearing told him that the cabin was empty. Sniffing, he could detect the near fresh scent of a man and a muddled odour of what took him a moment to sort out before he realised it was a woman. Curious to know who the female was, Tobias took another step, his nostrils working furiously as he scanned the room. After a moment, he began following the scents about as he tried to piece together how long ago the two had been in the cabin.<br />
<br />
Room by room, he searched the building meticulously. He discovered the bedroom the woman had slept in, the kitchen where smells of food where still semi-fresh, &quot;No more than an hour or so old,&quot; Tobias decided, and the couch where the man had slept. But what he could not figure out was whether the man was Eli&#39;s brother and who the woman was. Returning to one of the bedrooms, he nabbed a change of clothes for Eli, figuring that she couldn&#39;t go about in her pyjamas. Thinking that maybe he should get himself a fresh pair of clothes, Tobias in the end decided her didn&#39;t need anything at the moment. Taking one last look around the cabin, he was surprised to find a notepad in the kitchen area and reading what was printed on the first couple pages, he took it with to show it to Eli.<br />
<br />
Outside, Eli hugged herself and nervously worried her lower lip. There was something about the building that seemed almost malevolent. Trying to tell herself, &quot;It&#39;s just what Tobias told me. He&#39;d trying to scare me,&quot; she found herself doubting even this and wanting to prove, more to herself than anything, that what the man had told her was a load of bunk, she started to take a step closer, but stopped.<br />
<br />
There was something about the cabin that bothered her, but what it was, Eli wasn&#39;t certain. Thinking, she eventually told herself that it wasn&#39;t simply what Tobias had told her. Peering at the domicile, hoping her brother hadn&#39;t actually gone into building, she shuddered at the idea of him actually having gone in and the possibility of him somehow ending up cursed like Tobias. Turning away from the cabin, she took a couple steps away and stopped when she saw that, at some point, the wolves had vanished. Scared at the prospect they were prowling close by, Eli gazed wildly about, searching for signs of them.<br />
<br />

<br />
Unable to figure out what the man meant when he man the odd noises, Mathew struggled to find a way to communicate. Glancing down at the story, briefly taking in a sentence here and there, it suddenly dawned on him. Not being the best creative writer, he flipped to a blank page and went to find a pen. Returning, he sat at the table, thought about what to write, then slowly began to scribble out something that esentially told the man that whilst he was reading the what had been written, the man should eat breakfast, &quot;But Mathew doesn&#39;t know what the man would like, if anything,&quot; he finished then handed the legal pad back to the young man.<br />
<br />
Another series of hoots, Linus took it, hesitated, then also took the pen. Reading carefully what had been written, he hummed a tune from a television programme, made notes on what he knew to be errors, then flipped over to the next page. Carefully writing out a response, Linus went back over what he had and tried to figure out if he had made any mistake. When he couldn&#39;t find any, though he was sure they were there, he handed the pad of paper and pen back, enjoying what he was starting to think of was a game of pass-the story.<br />
<br />
Mathew, after taking the pad, read what had been written. Thinking, &quot;Linus,&quot; he nodded and said, &quot;Okay,&quot; as he looked at the man and explained that he was going to make him breakfast. Starting to turn to do so, he stopped when he saw the look on Linus&#39; face. Guessing what it was that he wanted, Mathew thought a minute before trying to write, creatively, how he was going to fix Linus something for breakfast. When he finished that, he handed the notepad back and before Linus could make any of the noises he normally made, or even begin to write, Mathew turned away and began searching the kitchen for what Linus wrote that he normally ate for breakfast - Poptarts, one egg scrambled, a plain bagel and a glass of orange juice.<br />
<br />
When he&#39;d finished preparing breakfast for Linus, Mathew sat and read everything he&#39;d written on the notepad. At first, he was overwhelmed by how someone who had such a limited form of communicating could create something so in-depth and potent enough to convey not only what Linus felt, but also to draw him, Mathew, in. Then, he lost himself completely and was completely absorbed in a story he quickly realised wasn&#39;t so much a creative narrative, but a tale of how Linus had ended up at the cabin. When he finished, he sat and thought on what he&#39;d read, finding it disturbing that Linus continuously referred to him as the pretty girl with the face of a boy and that it was already clear the curse was trying to get at Linus, even though the man didn&#39;t understand why his pecker grew hard. Turning to look at Linus, Mathew thought about everything that happened to him, then reached for the pen, flipped to the nearest blank page and began to write a story on how he would try to get Linus back to the ones he called the father, the mother and the sister.<br />
<br />
Across the table from Mathew, Linus hooted contentedly as he concentrated on his breakfast. It wasn&#39;t quite the same as the way the mother would fix it, but he figured it would do until he could get back to the temporary domiciles. Finishing, he picked his plush unicorn up from where he&#39;d set her on the table, hooted, &quot;Can&#39;t take no more, wonder if you&#39;ll understand,&quot; as he watched the girl with face of a boy who was called Mathew push the notepad toward him. Reaching for it, he read what had been added as the one called Mathew cleared the table.<br />
<br />
Something in his trusting nature led him to believe that the Mathew wanted to help him return to the father, the sister and the mother. When the girl with the face of a boy told him it was time to leave, Linus balked. Not because he didn&#39;t want to return to the site of the temporary domiciles, but because he was unsure how the Mathew would find it and because he was uncertain on whether he should take the notepad with. Mind racing, leaping from choice to choice to choice, Linus finally decided to allow the girl with the face of a boy lead the way and setting the notepad aside, he stood and followed after, only bothered by how the thing that made water still was rock hard and insistent he touch it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Tobias exited the cabin, glad to get out of it as quickly as he could, even though he knew his search had taken around ten minutes or so. Spotting Eli searching for something, he knew instantly what she was searching for. Approaching her quickly, sniffing the air and only smelling her rich and tantalising sex, Tobias tried to push from his mind the thoughts of wanting to drop to his knees, thrust his face between her legs, taste the secret area that was her vulva and maybe see if she&#39;d do something about his throbbing, needing cock. Thrusting out the the stuff he&#39;d brought with, he explained, &quot;We missed them. And by them, I mean your brother and another, someone Linus describes in the first couple pages as a girl with the face of a boy,&quot; and turning away, he quickly headed out of the clearing, smelling at the air, trying to pick up even the faintest trace of Linus and the other&#39;s scent.<br />
<br />
Surprised by Tobias&#39; abruptness, Eli wondered if something was the matter. Considering that he&#39;d found something inside the cabin that had upset him, she glanced at the pad of paper he&#39;d given. Holding the clothes clumisly underneath the notepad, she read the top page, then breathed a sigh of relief the instant she recognised her brother&#39;s handwriting, Quickly reading everything, including Linus&#39; encounter with the one he called a girl with a face of a boy, Eli was taken aback when she suddenly found that somebody else had been writing. Reading everything printed to the end, disturbed by some parts, she turned and hurried toward Tobias. Calling out, &quot;Hey. How much of this did you read?&quot; as she approached him.<br />
<br />
A shrug and Tobias said, &quot;Only the first couple pages. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the girl with the face of a girl. It&#39;s your brother, Mathew,&quot; Eli responded and flipping the pages of the notepad to the point where Tobias&#39; brother had begun writing, she handed the pad of paper to Tobias and hugging the clothes he&#39;d given her to her chest, she watched the incredulous look slowly spread across his face as he read that last couple pages.</p>
