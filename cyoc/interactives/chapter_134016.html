<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Wakey, wakey, puppy Chad!  Now it gets really bad.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad woke with a sore jaw.  He tried moving it, but was limited by the heavy leather hood on his head.  He tried to stand but apparently, he was in a large cage designed for some sort of animal.  There was something in his mouth that pressed down on his tongue forcing it out of his mouth, so he couldn&#39;t speak, and there some sort of clamps preventing him from closing his mouth. He explored the smooth leather hood on his head with his tongue.  It seemed to project from his face beyond his tongue&#39;s reach.  It felt like smooth leather.  He grunted and made guttural noises that reminded him of a growling dog, when he tried to speak.  He felt woozy.  He had tried to stand, and hit the barred ceiling overhead.  Then he had laid back down with his head resting on his shiny black rubber clad arm.  At first he thought it was leather like the hood, but when he lay down on it, it had a rubbery smell.  Even though his movements were limited, the rubber fit more like a skin than a suit made of the same material as hood would. He could hear real dogs yipping and yapping nearby.  He had gas, and tried to pass it. He couldn&#39;t. He realized that his ass was numb, and there was something inside.  <br />
<br />
He stood on all fours and looked around.  Through the bars of the cage, he could see.  It was a fairly sterile looking room.  Tile floors with a drain in the center.  A coiled hose hung by a nearby metal trough with kitchen sink faucet over it, to which the hose was attached by a diverter valve.  Overhead was a single light bulb glaring down on him. There was a large  bare metal work table that he realized was big enough for Chad to stretch out on.  He vaguely remembered feeling metal under his bare back, arms and legs.  Damn, that&#39;s why his arm pits, chest and crotch itched so badly under the rubber, somebody had shaved him.  He knew what it felt like because when he was a frosh, as initiation to the water polo team, he had to shave all over. He&#39;d itched for days. Damn, with his hands in rubber mitts, and rubber covering most of his body, there was no way for him to treat the itch.  Still?  He looked down between his arms, and saw his cock clad in black rubber too, but what shocked him were his nuts. They were bright red in with a black rubber divider separating his balls, and black rubber shaft stretching his testicles away from his body.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s ears perked up, when he heard his name spoken.  It sounded like his mother. Yes, someone was going to help him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;URF!&quot; barked Chad.  He stopped suddenly, hearing that his cry for help sounded like a barking dog.  He tried again, &quot;Urf!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mrs. Masterson, sign right there, under your husband&#39;s signature.  Ah, good, now we can begin Chad&#39;s training and modification in earnest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose it&#39;s for the best.  It&#39;s a wonder he didn&#39;t knock up one of those girls,&quot; Chad&#39;s mother said with a sigh.  &quot;I cannot believe he kept a score book.  If that nice boy Bruno hadn&#39;t told us where to find it, I suppose he would probably have ruined his life by getting a girl pregnant.   You&#39;re sure this is the best way to handle the situation?  It seems a bit-?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all agreed it&#39;s for the best.  Didn&#39;t we Dawn? Chad will be a good boy now,&quot; said Coach Sinclair.  Coach Sinclair?  Yes, that was his voice.  Damn hypnosis!  Chad remembered how the coach had used hypnosis to help train the team.  He must have done it to Chad&#39;s parents because they were repeating what the coach said the way the players repeated the coach.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We all agreed it&#39;s for the best.  Chad will be a good boy now,&quot; droned Mr. and Mrs. Masterson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad will be a good boy.  And every good boy needs a master.  We discussed this earlier.  Have you made up your minds yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, um, Brad&#39;s busy with college.  He doesn&#39;t really have time to take responsibility for Chad,&quot; said Mr. Masterson.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Thad&#39;s just starting high school.  While he&#39;s always wanted a dog, I think Chad might distract him from his studies,&quot; said Mrs. Masterson.<br />
<br />
&quot;A boy like Chad does need a strong male hand,&quot; said the coach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and Bruno is such a good friend of Chad&#39;s, I think he should be his master.  After all he told us Chad is his best friend,&quot; said Mr. Masterson.<br />
<br />
&quot;RHUNO?&quot; growled Chad, &quot;RHO REND RUF RHINE!&quot; barked Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that doesn&#39;t sound good!&quot; remarked Mrs. Masterson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s perfectly normal, boys often wake up disoriented.  Now that you authorized all the training and treatments, Chad will be a good boy in no time now.  He&#39;ll make a perfect bitch boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch boy?&quot; Mr. Masterson said in a confused tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I said Beta Boy.  Bruno will be Alpha to Chad&#39;s Beta.  We decided it would be for the best.  Chad will be a good boy.  Chad will be a good boy.  Chad will be a good boy.  You can forget about him, leave every thing to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mr. Sinclair.  We&#39;ll put Chad out of our minds, and leave him in your good hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their footsteps retreated down the hallway, as Chad yelped, &quot;URF!, URF! RUNT REEVE REE! URF! URF!&quot;<br />
<br />
About five minutes later, the door to his room opened.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Such nice people the Mastersons are, and such good subjects.  Much better than you are Chad, which is why it was necessary to go this route,&quot; said the coach, as Chad maneuvered on all fours in the small cage to turn to face the coach at the back of his cage, &quot;Good boy, Chad, looks like you&#39;re already adapting nicely to your new status,&quot; said Coach Sinclair.<br />
<br />
&quot;RUCK RUU!&quot; shouted Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, that gag is really ingenious, it makes the wearer sound like a dog.  But no, you won&#39;t be fucking anyone ever again.  That&#39;s part of the training and modification authorized.  You may get hard, but you won&#39;t be able to touch your cock or mount another person without your Master&#39;s express orders.  In fact, the only way you will experience a pleasurable orgasm after you graduate from my obedience school will be if you have a nice warm cock buried in your ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RUK?&quot; gasped Chad.<br />
<br />
Coach leaned forward next to the cage, he took a syringe out of his pocket and jabbed it between the bars and into Chad&#39;s rubber clad thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;URF! RUK? RUU RANT RUU RITH!&quot; barked Chad, &#39;RITS ROT RHUGUL!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I already did, and I have your parental consent.  It&#39;s true you&#39;re an adult, but you&#39;re still their dependent.  And with Bruno&#39;s judge father&#39;s signature, you&#39;ve been legally committed for psychological training. Now legally you can only be held for 72 hours without your consent, so if you want to you can check yourself out on Monday.  Except during the next 48 hours, you will have intensive training, and you won&#39;t want to check yourself out, as it will displease your new master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RAH?&quot; said Chad shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, that injection should already be reaching your brain, and increasing your olafactory accuity.  In case, you&#39;re wondering, I used grease pencil to mark where your veins are under the suit, while I was shaving you, and coating you with depilatory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RIFRILRITRY?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha,&quot; you know you sound like Scooby Doo, &quot;But you are a bit more vocal that I like our dogs to be.  I may have to add a shock collar to your training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RUK RULLUR? RHORAY!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But for now,&quot; Coach Sinclair said taking a plastic zippered baggy out of his lab coat pocket, &quot;As you know Bruno rarely takes off his Speedo, and to make sure that his scent is good and strong, I had him not go in the pool for the last week.  He&#39;s been training by running on the treadmill, using exercise bike, rowing machine, and lifting weights.  I know you probably assumed he&#39;d been in the pool because his suit was wet when he rubbed up against you at lunch, but no, he&#39;d just spent nearly an hour in the sauna and steam rooms.  Now here&#39;s the stinky product of his bad hygiene,&quot; Coach said with a flourish as he unzipped the pouch, and pulled out Bruno&#39;s blue Speedo.  He lowered it over the snout sticking from Chad&#39;s hood, and clipped it something on the hood. Chad shook his head violently, but couldn&#39;t get the Speedo off his face.  He crinkled his nose.  The acrid manly stench of Bruno filled his senses.  There were bursts of color in his mind which he associated with the Bruno&#39;s scent. He kept shaking his head, and cursing softly and unintelligibly as Coach Sinclair walked over to the metal table and took out a speaker and phone.  He plugged them into the outlet behind the table, and hit play.<br />
<br />
&quot;A GOOD DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER&#39;S SCENT.  INHALE DEEPLY.  YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD BOY, DON&#39;T YOU&quot; droned Coach&#39;s voice.  Their was a pause, and Bruno&#39;s voice said, &quot;CHAD&quot;, another brief pause, and Coach Sinclair continued, &quot;A GOOD DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER&#39;S SCENT.  INHALE DEEPLY.  YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD DOG.  MEMORIZE YOUR MASTER&#39;S SCENT.  YOUR MASTER OWNS YOU.  YOU LIKE BEING OWNED. YOU FEEL SAFE BEING OWNED. YOU NEED TO BE OWNED.  A GOOD DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER&#39;S SCENT.  INHALE DEEPLY.  YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD DOG BOY, DON&#39;T YOU?  A GOOD DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER&#39;S SCENT.  YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD DOG, DON&#39;T YOU,&quot; Coach pauses,  Bruno says, &quot;CHAD?&quot;  Coach continues, &quot;YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR MASTER PROUD, DON&#39;T YOU, BOY?  INHALE.  THIS IS YOUR MASTER&#39;S SCENT MEMORIZE IT.  YOUR MASTER IS YOUR REASON FOR BEING. YOU LOVE AND OBEY YOUR MASTER.  YOU NEED TO LOVE AND OBEY YOUR MASTER, DON&#39;T YOU,&quot; Coach paused again, and Bruno said, &quot;CHAD, DON&#39;T YOU?&quot;  Then the MP3 on a loop began to repeat except this time with a musical background.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t a loop, thought Chad inhaling deeply as the message told him. He did want to be a good dog -er, good boy.  Dog boy?  Boy dog? The drugs were doing their job.  The coach turned out the light, as he left.  Now the only colors that Chad saw were in his mind and were associated with the concept of his new master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ruk ruu,&quot; murmured Chad, then as he started to drift off, he added, &quot;RYME RUH RUD ROG.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruno watched the night vision camera feed on the TV monitor in front of his own kennel.  Yes, Chad was his bitch now, or soon would be.  He wagged his tail eagerly thinking about how he would soon be helping train his bitch boi.    He was proud of himself.  Coach had questioned whether Bruno could convince Chad&#39;s parents to put him into the program as a Beta.  So for the past year, Bruno had been working on.  He hadn&#39;t been able to insinuate himself into Chad&#39;s life as his best friend, but he had managed to convince Chad&#39;s parents that he was their son&#39;s best friend. And after the coach&#39;s training, Chad would indeed be Bruno&#39;s best friend with benefits.  Bruno yipped in delight, and curled up watching Chad mumble in his induced sleepy state repeating the message that the coach had programmed into Chad&#39;s own iPhone.<br />
<br />
After about an hour, the next lesson began on the iPhone.  The drug in Chad&#39;s body heightened his sense of smell, his hearing, and increased his focus.  It was an experimental drug that the coach had acquired from contacts at the university professors who had picked certain undergrads to be their house boys and pets, and sent them to the Coach&#39;s obedience school.  His prices were so high, only about a tenth of the class were actually dogs, and those dogs mostly belonged to slave boys&#39; masters.  Coach trained them to keep their master&#39;s boys/dog boys in line.</p>
