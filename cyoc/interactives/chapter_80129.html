<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Calvin took a pair of size 13 Flip Flops and brought them to Dave. They were blue, and pretty big, especially for Dave's size 9 feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;These won't fit me, I'm sure of it!&quot; exclaimed Dave to Calvin.<br />
&quot;Oh, but beachwear isn't meant to be super tight, you need to have it be comfortable on you!&quot; replied the store employee, keeping calm and charismatic.<br />
&quot;Alright, I understand that,&quot; said Dave, &quot;But I don't go to the beach often anyway. I know you think these would suit me, but they're far too large and I really don't need them.&quot; Dave was trying to let Calvin down easy and not outright tell him he didn't want to try them on.<br />
&quot;You say that before you've even tried them on! How about you try them on, then you can say for sure that they're not your thing.&quot; replied Calvin, keeping an optimistic air about him.<br />
Dave shrugged and started to take off his shoes, deciding to comply with Calvin's request which seemed more like a demand, and Calvin stopped him quickly.<br />
&quot;Oh no, you can't do that in here. You have to use one of our change rooms!&quot; he exclaimed, as he urged Dave over to the side wall in the store.<br />
&quot;What? They're just shoes, though. Technically they aren't even shoes!&quot; exclaimed Dave, shocked at the service he was getting.<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Dave, it's company policy. Try them on in the change room! See me when you're done!&quot;<br />
Dave grumbled and went into the change room, and he took off his shoes and socks in there. He held the large flip flops in his hands, looking them over. They didn't have any logos or designs on them, they were just a blue color, kind of like how the ocean looks. Dave slipped his feet into the slip flops, putting the band in between his big toe and other toes, and wiggled his toes. There was a large space around his foot which the flip flop covered.<br />
After wiggling his toes, he realized that Calvin was right. The flip flops felt extremely comfortable on his feet, perhaps due to the fact that it was much bigger. He looked in the mirror and smiled. There must have been something in the shoes, he was feeling super relaxed. He ran his hands through his wavy brown hair, not noticing that as he did so, the hair lightened to a blond and shortened in length. He felt a pleasurable sensation through his scalp as his hair squished and molded into a squished up faux hawk style, lightening to a natural yellow blond.<br />
In his reflection, the hair on Dave's arms was lightening and becoming less dense. Some of the hairs seemed to disappear, and others grew thinner. Dave felt a scratching on his chest, and he pulled off his shirt to see what it was. He threw the shirt in the pile of old clothes that belonged to the store, revealing a shell necklace that wasn't there before, and a smooth chest. The hairs on Dave's chest were retracting into his body, changing color to a light brown as they underwent the process.<br />
Dave started to feel a shift in his pants, as the denim of his jeans inched up to around just under his knees and started to feel lighter. As he looked at his exposed legs, they had very little hair on them, and that which was there was light yellow blond and sparse. The jeans started to shift materials into smooth polyester and a white Hawaiian floral pattern appeared on them, as they slowly became board shorts. Dave could feel his manhood become free and loose, as his underwear merged into the shorts, two becoming one.<br />
Dave stared into the mirror, looking at himself, as he felt another itching on his chest. He watched, mesmerized, as his chest began to puff out, muscles showing their way through his body. His flat stomach pressed out into some serious six pack abs, and his complexion took on a nice tan. The changes swept outward through the center of his body. He watched as his arms and legs changed color and tanned as they swelled and ballooned with muscle, hard earned muscle from surfing and doing competitions. He felt a sting as around his right pectoral a large black tribal tattoo made it's appearance.<br />
Dave looked into his face as he watched the change hit him there. His face gained the same tan as the rest of his body, becoming bronzed from hours out in the sun. He watched as his jaw expanded, and shaggy blond beard hairs grew out from his face, matching the hair on his head and the rest of his body. His eyes shrunk a little bit, becoming a piercing blue, and his nose became slightly bigger. His eyebrows lightened to match his new body, and became thicker. Dave's mouth became slightly bigger and curved into a natural smile.<br />
Dave was complete, he now looked like a macho, masculine surfer male. He flexed into the mirror and appreciated the beauty of his body.<br />
Calvin knocked on the door, &quot;Dave, are you finished yet?&quot;<br />
Dave shook his head, and apologized. &quot;Sorry bro, I kinda forgot that I was hear to try shit on, ya know?&quot;. His voice was masculine, and had the vocal patterns of a macho surfer male. He walked out of the change room and saw Calvin.<br />
&quot;So how do you like them?&quot; asked the salesman from the store.<br />
&quot;They're gnarly shreds dude, I think I'll take 'em!&quot; replied Dave enthusiastically.<br />
&quot;Excellent! We're having a promotion on, so you actually get a second item free with the purchase of your flip flops. How about I help you pick out something that would suit you?&quot; asked Calvin.<br />
&quot;That would be wicked, bro!&quot; exclaimed Dave.</p>
