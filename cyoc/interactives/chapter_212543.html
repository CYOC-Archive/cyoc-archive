<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate grabs the merchant off the bed, loading him onto his shoulder as he marches out of the room. Sure, he could just fuck this guy right now and make him into a pirate. But these doubts are starting to get annoying, and if anyone can help deal with them it&#39;d be his old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-please. I need you.&quot; The merchant begs as he is held in place. Nate isn&#39;t as strong as most of the pirates, but he has gotten enough strength to at least carry a thin guy like this. &quot;Yer&#39;ll get it. Just relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the deck, most of the men have finished changing. Where once was guards and traders is now an assortment of pirates. From big and burly, to thin and lithe, to rotund and older. Each a shadow of their former self, and happily embracing the rest of the crew. It&#39;s the best sight you could have after a hard-won victory, and it only makes Nate desire release even more. But it won&#39;t be much longer, he just has to see his father and then it&#39;ll start.<br />
<br />
Getting back to his ship, Nate orders a few to grab any cargo and store it onboard. Descending down to the lower level and opening the door to the captain&#39;s quarters. Strongarm at the window, watching the attack on the trader ship with a wide smirk. Head tilting to look at who has entered, a proud look overtaking the man as he sees the captive merchant.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that you&#39;ve got there, boy?&quot; Nate carries the man over to his father&#39;s bed. Laying him spread out across the sheets. &quot;A merchant that&#39;s in need of cock. Was hopin&#39; ye might be able to help me with this one.&quot; Strongarm walks over to the merchant, finger under hischin and forcing his head to tilt up. Then to the left, then the right. &quot;He&#39;s ain&#39;t got much to him. But, if yer pops is involved, then lets make this a special one, aye? You were wanting an older brother, savvy?&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s right, Nate remembers that he told Strongarm he always wanted an older brother. Someone to compete with, and he&#39;d soon have that. The pirate captain stripping down, and the merchant staring in awe. Taking in his huge pecs, the red hairs traced with bits of grey from his older age. Body still in a fit and strong shape for this giant of a man, bodybuilder like proportions starting to strain as he grabs the end of his bed and lifts it into the centre of the room. His muscles taunt, veins visible. Expression fierce as he grunts and carefully places it down to allow easy access for both him and his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye got a preference for ass or lips, boy?&quot; Strongarm asks, sweat dripping from his brow, but still full of stamina. &quot;Ass, ye can have his head.&quot; Nate speaks while getting into position. Grabbing onto the merchants legs, while his father gets a hold of his arms. Flipping the man over to his stomach, his cock now firmly planted against the beds sheets as he starts to weakly thrust. Needing some sort of pleasure, which the father and son duo will soon provide. Strongarm forcing him to get on all fours, his thrusts stopping as the captain goes to the head of the bed, and his son the rear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Start off with a strong grab, boy. We&#39;re wanting this one to know his place.&quot; The older brigand grabs the captive by the top of his head, in a vice grip where there&#39;s no hope of escape. Nate matches as best he can, one hand on either side of the man&#39;s curvy hips, keeping him as still as he can while lining up cock with ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye gotta give him a warm welcome. A good thrust to start. Like this!&quot; His fingers tense, the captive&#39;s head being forced down as the pirates&#39; hips drive forward. Lips as wide as they can manage, the older pirates cock stuffing the man&#39;s throat. The traders nose rubbing against the rough pubes of the pirate, heavy balls slapping against his chin. Not even a moan able to escape, as Nate takes his old man&#39;s lesson to heart and shoves as much of his dick into the merchant&#39;s ass. Hips mashing against the traveler&#39;s smooth skin, his hole stretched and welcoming everything Nate has to offer. &quot;L-like this, pops?&quot;<br />
<br />
Strongarm grins, paying more attention to Nate than the man he is currently fucking. &quot;Good work, now we ain&#39;t stopping just yet.&quot; He moves his hips back, hand still holding onto the man&#39;s blond hair as he is dragged back with the motion. The captain pushing forward once his tight ass hits the bedframe, a thrust harder than the first, and more delightfully received by the merchant as his eyes close and mouth drools. Even from across the bed, Nate feels the impact of his father. The reverberation caused by that slam as the merchant&#39;s body is tense and pushing back against Nate. It feels good, going even deeper as the trader impales himself on the young pirate&#39;s dick. But he has a father to impress, and so he mimics the gesture. Hands pulling hips back, body preparing and his athletic muscles straining. Putting as much power as he can into the motion, slamming in like his old man, and seeing his proud expression grow further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thatta boy! Ye good to keep pace?&quot; The captain lines up for another thrust, Nate watching the motion again. How his arm balloons as the grip tightens, how his quadriceps tense as he moves back more and more. His gargantuan body slamming against the much smaller man, and Nate doing as much as he can to follow in his father&#39;s footsteps. Going back and forth, one thrust each as the men feel their cocks tense with each motion. Giving a steady taste of their pre to the man as the act almost becomes a competition. Nate understanding just how much force to use, enough to show his strength, but not enough to hurt the bastard he&#39;s fucking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer, mrmm, d-doing good, Nate. Ready for the next p-aargh... p-part?&quot; More sweat drips from both men. Having gone on for minutes, putting their all into every action. The only breaks being short moments of freedom from Strongarm so the merchant can catch his breath. Always being rewarded straight after with another taste of the captain&#39;s cock. &quot;C-could keep going f-faaaaack... For ages, pops.&quot; The two men share a grin, rough features matching the other perfectly, as strongarms grip loosens. Instead, roaming down to the man&#39;s back, from neck to spine. &quot;He&#39;s changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where the captain touches, Nate spots a growth of muscle. The thin man rapidly getting closer to the athletic body of Nate. Gaining a few inches of height, while torso stretches to gain the broad build of his new father and brother. Nate, not wanting to miss out on this experience, brings his hand to the trader&#39;s stomach. Mimicking his father again, from neck all the way down to his belly button. At first it&#39;s mostly flat. Then there&#39;s traces of hairs from top to bottom. Then two pecs are starting to define. Then line after line of emerging abs. He&#39;s caught up to Nate at this point, but it doesn&#39;t stop there. Body well hidden under the new red hairs, skin barely moving from the touch. Solid muscle underneath, cementing the heavy frame.<br />
<br />
Strongarm starts to thrust again, Nate focusing on his soon-to-be brother instead of his father. Only hearing &quot;Keep thrusting. Can appreciate him as we work.&quot; The pirate bucking his hips to shove in and out of the merchants ass as he keeps feeling him. Each part of his six-pack now entirely defined. Abdominis muscles as firm as they can naturally be and cushioned with red fuzz. Skin only sinking for the mans belly button, and Nate seeming satisfied with the strong proportions of his brother.<br />
<br />
Looking for more guidance between thrusts, Nate sees his father have a strong grip on the man&#39;s arms. Squeezing as they start to inflate, with each dose of cum, getting even larger. Nate taking the opposite side, his hand far smaller than his fathers, but still able to get a good feel of the man&#39;s bicep. How with each passing second it balloons more and starts to strain. Defining before his very eyes, lines of muscle connecting underneath the tanned skin. Marking new strength, lengthening and connecting to a set of heavy looking hands. Far from the previous thin and dexterous pair, instead having two brutish mitts that would be better suited to gripping a flagon of ale.<br />
<br />
The merchants proportions start to alter further as his arms finish growing. Gaining even more height, now comfortably six feet tall with more to grow. His ass losing most of its fat and becoming firm. Changing not just externally, but internally as well. Nate feeling the hole growing deeper, yet still nice and tight for his cock. Experimentally digging even deeper, enjoying how it almost forms around his dick. Extending as he has just reached the previous limit.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a looker.&quot; Strongarm calls, eyeing the toughening visage of his newest child. The turning man&#39;s shoulder length hair going from blonde to the pirates distinct red. Stubble lining his chin and reaching down to his now pronounced Adams apple, brows growing thicker, nose slightly wider. Chin flattening and cheeks losing their puffiness. &quot;Yer going to love him, boy.&quot; Nate looks to his father, wanting nothing more than to see his new brother, but knowing that he hasn&#39;t finished with his job just yet. The merchants&#39; legs have only just hardened up to support the rest of his upper body, and now the most exciting change sparks. His body getting a nice coating of course hairs, so dense at the back of his arms that it almost looks like fur. While his cock starts to pulse and demand attention.<br />
<br />
His own needs have been ignored this entire time. Dick just weakly resting against his chest, leaking pre onto the bed. Nate doesn&#39;t need any direction from his father to know what to do. Hand wrapping around the needy member. Slick with pre, and easy to stroke. Nate pulling the skin back and forth, up and down in time with his and his father&#39;s thrusts. It was good for the both of them, relief for the merchant, and Nate getting to feel his new family member&#39;s beefy body. With each stroke, the back of his arm runs along the abs of his brother. He wants to be as tough as him and dad, but he&#39;s still the youngest, it&#39;ll take a long time.<br />
<br />
As his mind lingers on that thought, the newest member of the family begins to age. It starts with his skin feeling weathered, a bit tough and rough with callouses emerging on his hands. Then wrinkles across his brow as his face rests in its natural scowl, years of that expression marked on his visage. Everything culminating into a few strands of gray spotted in his mane of hair. It all becoming too much for Nate, as he looks to his father who&#39;s starting to strain. &quot;P-pops. I can&#39;t hold back anymore. Gotta cum...&quot; Strongarm nodding, &quot;Aye, then don&#39;t. Give him one last thrust, son!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking his father&#39;s word, Nate puts everything he has left into one last push. Buckling under his own pressure, chest resting atop his brothers back, cum pouring into the man&#39;s well used hole. The motion causing a chain of events, as the merchant drops from his knees and onto his stomach. Nate continuing to stroke his cock, barely able to contain it in his hand as glops of seed stain the beds fabric. Strongarm pulled down with the other two. Giving his newest son their favorite drink, then collapsing onto the both of them. All three a pile ontop of each other. Sweaty, panting, and overjoyed. Strongarm holding his children against him, &quot;I love my boys. Nate, Morgan, ye make this bastard proud.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan frees himself from the group. Pushing his way out and presenting himself for the rest of the family. Clearly his father&#39;s son, in his late 20s and standing 6&#39;3. Chest forward, large and well-muscled, top heavy and covered in red hairs. Shoulder length hair a partial mess, giving a wild look to the newest pirate. Cock 9 inches erect, with a heavy sac underneath, and countless pubes above. &quot;Yeah pops, love you both too.&quot; He grins, looking as natural an expression as the family scowl. Voice having the same seafarer dialect and bassy tone. &quot;Just wish Nate was half the man we were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a few more months!&quot; Nate rebuts, matching his brothers grin with a confident smirk. &quot;Aye? If ye can&#39;t lift me by the end of the month. Then I get your hole for the week. Savvy?&quot; They were recent family, and they were already at it. Nate shaking his hand. &quot;Savvy.&quot; Strongarm watches his boys with interest, laughing to himself then getting off the bed. &quot;A good bet. Though ye can both keep training your muscles by cleaning all this.&quot; He gestures to the mess they&#39;ve made. Sweat covering the bed, sheets stained with their stink and cum. Nate and Morgan giving their father a stoic look and saying a shared &quot;Aye.&quot;</p>
