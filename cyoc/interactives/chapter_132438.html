<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scarlette had a bit to go on so far: Missy had the remote, and she has absorbed one of the male co-workers. All she had to do was look around, she would be bound to run into her at some point. As Scarlette scanned the room, she noticed a coffee cup on her desk with a smiley face drawn on the side, she touched the side of the cup and felt its warmth, Missy was nearby, and probably watching her from where she was now.<br />
First things first, Scarlette was going to go to the break room, that coffee might be a first big clue. When she opened the door she was greeted by an interesting sight, and Missy had most definitely been here: A guy and girl from admin were up on the counter top, fused together with the coffee machine, and Scarlette watched as one of the junior execs lined up a cup under the girls pussy and pressed her clit; a grinding sounds could be heard inside until a faint moan escaped her silver lips and coffee trickled out of her pussy, he then moved the cup across to the fused guy and pressed down on his cock, pumping out a shot of cream into his coffee; it was at this point Scarlette was glad she had missed her morning caffeine fix.<br />
<br />
Scarlette approached the junior exec “excuse me, have you seen a guy with light blue hair around the office today, Scarlette grimaced as he took a sip of his coffee and then said “yeah, some guy like that was wondering around the supply room giggling like an idiot, who&#39;s his boss I want to have words with him about it”. Scarlette shrugged “Sorry, not sure who he answers to, I just need to see him about something”. With that, Scarlette left the man to his &#39;coffee&#39; and hurried to the supply room, laptop in her bag over her shoulder.<br />
Scarlette approached the supply room, she could still hear the laughing coming from inside. Cautiously she pushed the door ajar and was hit with a flash of green light. <br />
The breasts on her head started to tingle, and then jiggle and vibrate uncontrollably; the nipples sucked into the breasts as they lost their mass rapidly, the bra falling from her head. It was like Scarlette&#39;s face had returned to normal, but it was short lived as her head started to widen her face staying in position in the process. Next her lips tingled as they thinned and also began to widen, stretching out right to the edges of her head as it began to take on a rectangular shape. The small freckles on Scarlettes face began to shift now, turning square and raising to form buttons, they shifted to the right side of her face, lighting up to show numbers across them.<br />
<br />
A figure sat up from behind a cabinet at the back of the supply room “Hey girl, enjoying yourself?” It was Missy, or at least what she would look like as a guy: taller now with broad shoulders dressed in a standard business suit with short, light blue hair. Scarlette walked up to her and grabbed at the remote, which Missy pulled away at the last second “nuh-uh, not yet sweetie and pressed a button on the mobile phone in her other hand. Scarlette felt a spark in her head...almost like a thought going off, almost like she was imagining a message saying &#39;Missy wins&#39;.<br />
Suddenly the inside of her head jerked, Scarlette feeling the need to puke, the feeling kept rising until something was in her mouth her teeth and tongue moving erratically against her will around the object pushing through her face.<br />
Missy walked over and grabbed the object as it passed between what was left of her lips, and held it up to Scarlette, &#39;Missy wins&#39; was written on a piece of paper.<br />
Scarlettes hands darted up to her head, feeling around, Missy had made Scarlette&#39;s head into a printer.<br />
“no-not fun-ny” Scarlette said her printer mouth and her breast and crotch faces having trouble talking in sync now.<br />
“Oh relax it&#39;s all just fun” Missy said “And you did find us both so I guess ill start changing these people back” and with that she shot herself, her larger body condensing back into a smaller more slender form, her light blue hair flowing back out to her shoulders as her breasts pushed out, clothing returning to its former state. The pair, with Skye still in the bag, went around the office, aiming that remote and hitting the blue button on everyone they came across: the two stuck in the coffee maker wandering back to their desks holding empty cups of coffee, staring at them with a strange look. The elevator man slowly emerging from the doors, left standing nearby, watching it open and close. The receptionist was next, her body almost &#39;lifting&#39; upward until she simply sat on the chair itself. And finally the man with his box of dicks, Missy needing to shoot each individual one for a good few minutes until they were all gone.<br />
<br />
The pair walked out of the building and walked to Skye&#39;s nearby car “Skye wont mind if I do thee driving will she?” Missy said with a smile “Let&#39;s just not tell her” Scarlette replied, staring into her bag with skye, still in laptop form, in sleep mode.<br />
A short time later they were back at Skye&#39;s apartment. Walking through the door Scarlette dumped her bag on the couch before jumping “Oh no, Skye” before stopping for a second and giggling “you deserve it”. Missy then produced the remote and aimed at Scarlette, who was looking at the mirror at the time, and pressed the blue button a few times. First Scarlettes crotch face began to lose form, her mouth turning vertically and pulling into her former pussy, the feelings of the shifting bring her to orgasm, one final orgasmic cry escaping as it tightened into the plump folds they once were, the set of eyes rolling backwards and slowly closing for good. Next her breast faces shifted, the noses flattening and eyes pulling closed, the final part of which were the lips puckering impossibly tight, cooing as they finally smoothed out into nipples, which became erect almost immediately. Scarlettes clothing was shifting at the same time also, the reality of her form dictation theirs; her skirt closing as a bra formed over her still sensitive breasts, lifting and encasing them tenderly.<br />
And at last Scarlettes printer head; changing back in the same way that it had formed buttons, smoothing out and shifting back into mere freckles, her head and lips pulling back into their original shape.<br />
Scarlette was now back to her old self, she felt herself over just to make sure, her hands lingering over her privates and breasts, and sighed; this was one hell of a day. Scarlette went to have a shower while Missy was turning Skye back.<br />
The shower was amazing, the hot water purifying Scarlettes soul of worry. She felt like a new woman and in spite of what had occurred today; it was only early afternoon and she was feeling ready for fun and revenge.</p>
