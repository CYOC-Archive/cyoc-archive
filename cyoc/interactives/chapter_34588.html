<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Tiffany was at work, I decided it was high time to have fun.  I gazed at my new body in the mirror, deciding to take off my shirt.  I pulled my shirt up over my breasts, feeling them get squished, lifted, and dropped during the process.  I then undid my shorts and kicked them off.  I decided to do some poses in the mirror in just panties and bra.  Man, I was getting myself excited.  I was drop dead gorgeous.  My boobs were full, large, and protruded sexily.  My boobs had that 'just slightly too large for the bra look'.  Could Tiffany's boobs still be growing, or was it just a smaller or different brand bra?  Regardless, the bra was soon gone, leaving me topless.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment that my fun was interrupted.  From downstairs, I heard the door open.  What was Tiffany doing back?  Did she forget something, or did she get sick?  Then I heard someone call...<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiffany!  Are you at home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Who was that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiffany, I know you're here.  Your car is out front.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ach, Tiff had taken our parents car to work.  I finally recognized the voice though.  It was Tiff's good friend Keeley.  They had classes together.  She was 20 and a very good looker.  Not as well built up top as I now was, but definitely worth the time.  <br />
<br />
&quot;She's not here now!&quot; I yelled.  <br />
<br />
I realized then the foolishness of my move.  All Keeley heard was Tiffany yelling that she wasn't there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I'm up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Great.  I could hear Keeley coming up the stairs and here I was in just a pair of panties.  There was no escape.  I quickly shut the bedroom door, then pulled on my pair of shorts.  I reached for the bra and, as Tiffany showed me earlier, put my arms through the straps.  I then placed my boobs in the cups a slid the straps on my shoulders.  I reached back and after a few failed attempts, I got it clasped.  I reached for the shirt and quickly put it on.  I opened the door just as Keeley was preparing to knock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  How's it going.  Whatcha up to?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just finished cleaning my room.  What brings you over here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I wanted to go to the mall today, but couldn't find anyone to go with, so I figured I'd come over and see if you were available.  How about it.  Do you wanna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know Keeley.  I have some stuff to do today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's some laundry that needs doing and I'm not ready to go out yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon Tiffy.  I really wanna check out that new accessories store that opened up.  See if they have anything that matches my purse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel like gettin' all dolled up right now.  Its almost 3:30 anyway.  I don't have any makeup and I don't feel like putting it on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez Tiff, you sound like you're having a case of the crappies.  Here, tell ya what.  You just sit and I'll put your makeup on for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really want to go, don't ya Keeley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; I agreed.  <br />
<br />
Besides, it would give me some insight into the unknown world of makeup.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
At this point in time, Tiffany was not feeling well at all.  She had stomach cramps and felt feverish.  Her manager had been tough to convince, but finally, he compromised and agreed she could go home in 45 minutes.  All she had left was 45 minutes.  Oh, the minutes, they crept by so slow.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I was sitting in front of Tiffany's vanity with Keeley applying a coat of foundation on my face.  I was keeping a mental note of what she used and how much, just in case I would need to do this myself in the near future.  <br />
<br />
It was at the time that she was applying eye liner that my poor dressing skills became evident.  I was breathing in a deep sigh, when at the apex of my breath, my bra came undone with an audible *pop*.  Keeley looked down as my chest clearly lost its support.  She began to laugh as I began to blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Tiffany.  That happened to me just the other day and it got me to wondering if it ever happened to anyone else.  Now I have my answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
I reached up under my shirt and tried to clasp the bra again, but I had no luck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, take your shirt off if you need to Tiff,&quot; Keeley said as she stepped back.  &quot;Lord knows I have a tough enough time getting my B cups secured.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was hesitant to take my shirt off in front of her and apparently, it showed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead Tiff.  We've changed shirts in front of each other before.  Besides, its always refreshing to see a healthier pair than mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing inwardly at Keeley's comment, I pulled my shirt off a second time.  My bra slipped down, revealing the nipple of my left boob.  I quickly pulled it back up and started to secure it, feeling embarrassed the whole time.  Rescue came at that moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Tiff, you don't want to wear that to the mall.  Here, since you are being such a sour puss, I'll pull out an outfit for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't understand how wearing a different bra would make any difference in my 'Mall Experience', especially since nobody would see it.  But here I was, getting a crash course in the world of women.<br />
<br />
In no time, Keeley had gone through Tiff's drawers and pulled out an entire outfit.  There was a white bra with a matching thong.  A 'brightly hued &amp; colorfully embroidered' pink skirt was used to accentuate a black, 'neutral' tank top.  The neckline was plunging, allowing for a show of 'that great cleavage' I had.  All this was paraphrased from Keeley's random comments as she went along.<br />
<br />
She then stood there, apparently waiting for me to get changed.  Apparently, Keeley and my sister didn't mind changing in front of each other.  Granted, they had known each other since high school.  So, I got up, dropped my bra and took off my shorts and panties.  I bent over the bed to pick up the thong.  I felt my tits pull at my chest as they swayed back and forth with my movements.  My nipples were becoming erect both because of the cool air, and because of the slight excitement I felt at changing in front of Keeley.  <br />
<br />
Soon, I had my boobs in the cups of the bra.  This time though, I didn't even try to hook it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keeley, would you mind fastening my bra.  I jammed my fingers today and am having a tough time getting it done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, no problem.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She came behind me and in two seconds, she had me secured.  The rest of the outfit was easy.  However, we weren't ready to go for another 15 minutes, what with finishing makeup, finding shoes, a matching purse and sunglasses, and of course, putting on lip gloss.  Sheez.  Finally she proclaimed me ready to shop at the mall.</p>
