<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the cramps in your stomach in creased, and your grip on the well&#39;s lip tightened, you for a brief moment remember your wish. But, before you can go too far with the train of thought, the cramps blossom into outright pain lancing up into your chest, neck and head, as well as down into your abdomen, groin, and legs. Moans turning into gasps into outright cries of pain, you release your hold upon the well, turn, stumble a few feet away to drop to your knees.<br />
<br />
The pain in your legs becoming too much to bear the moment you do this, you fall over to the ground. Lying on your side, arms wrapped around your torso, alternating between gasping and crying out in discomfort, you are not the least bit relieved when the pain shifts. Becoming a squeezing sensation, you are unsure which was worse - what was encompassing your head, reminding you of the time you caught your hand in a bench vice, the pressure as it felt as someone or something was pressing up on the souls of your feet as they pressed down at the same time on the top of your head, or the way your arms and legs feel as if they&#39;ve been lit afire whilst your insides twist and churn and your hands and feet feel as if they are being ground away.<br />
<br />
You are not sure if you pass out, or if it is something else. But glad for it, as it meant you didn&#39;t have to deal with the pain you were in, you are now free to wonder about your wish. Thinking about, curious to know why it had led to what had happened, as you feel yourself drift, your thoughts float back to the point leading up to you making your wish.<br />
<br />
For four years, you have sat and watched Julie, who you at first were conflicted about, but slowly grew to find them to be the most beautiful girl in your year. From the age of twelve, goaded by both yourself and friends, you have tried and tried to build up the nerve to ask her out, but never could bring yourself to do so. And when you began eleventh grade, you steeled your nerve at last, and told yourself, &quot;This was the year. This is when I shall ask out Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem you found with was how she was also surrounded by other girls, or often just one girl. Wanting to catch her alone, disliking the uncomfortable feeling you experienced every time you thought about asking her out in front of ours, you waited. Starting to believe you&#39;d never catch her alone, thinking, &quot;Maybe I should give up, or ask someone else out,&quot; it came as what you saw a great bit of luck when, arriving for school, you spotted her sitting alone. Dawdling, wanting to make sure what you saw was accurate, you almost lost your chance. But, before this could happen, you ambled across the quad in what you hoped was a leisure manner and not in a way which made you look like a dork, and slowing as you approach Julie, unsure what to say, you blurt out, &quot;Hi!&quot; before you can change your mind.<br />
<br />
A smile on her face, making her look even more radiant, Julie looks up at you from what she was doing, and after what seemed like an eternity, she reponds, &quot;Hi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what else to say, you fidget in place. Seeing she&#39;s expecting you either say something, or go away, you fumble for something to say, consider explaining how you share some of the same class, the way you&#39;ve sat next to each other on and off over the years, and finally, feeling as if you are blowing the situation, you blurt out, &quot;Hi!&quot; a second time, then, before she can say anything, rushed out, &quot;Wouldyouliketogooutsomething?Get something to eat?Drink?Catch a movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was another long pause, and you could swear you could feel the tension build. And then, as if she finally understood what you asked, Julie began to giggle. The giggle turning into a dainty laugh which made her even more beautiful, and curious to know what was so funny, you never got the chance to ask as she stood, collected her stuff, and hurried past you. Turning to watch her go, wanting to call out, enquire if it was something you said, you watch as she hurried across the quad to another girl pulling up on a bicycle. Recognising her as one of Julie&#39;s friends, you sigh, turn, and head inside, believing you blew it somehow, but unsure how.<br />
<br />
From there, it should have been smooth sailing through the rest of the day, as everything was the same as it had been the previous couple days. Instead, starting around lunch time, you were greeted by catcalls, snide comments you didn&#39;t understand, among other things which left you depressed and wondering what a lesbian was. Returning home, thinking it would be the end of it, you were met by your bratty, twelve-year-old sister, who said, &quot;Heard you finally got the courage to ask out Julie. You&#39;ve only been mooning over her for the past four years,&quot; and telling her to shut up, you listened as she replied, &quot;You know she bats for the other team, right. Came out last year,&quot; and finally having enough, you released all your pent up frustration on Catherine.<br />
<br />
Your row with hear escalating to the point you stormed out of the house, you tried to ignore her jeering laugh as you walked down the front walk. Wanting to get away from everything to forget the complications and worries of your life, your walk took you far, and before you knew it, you found yourself at the well. Recalling how you thrown your coin in and mentally thought, &quot;I wish I could understand girls better,&quot; as your mind flashed back to a movie you&#39;d seen some time ago where a guy had had an accident and suddenly was able to hear the thoughts of the females around him, and in the process gained a better understanding of the opposite sex. Going back over all this, believing the only thing which should have been different was a change in your mind, you are unable to determine why what happened had happened. Becoming aware you were no longer in any pain, you slowly open your eyes.<br />
<br />
Above, you see the pale blue sky of early to mid-afternoon through the trees. Blinking confused, not sure when you rolled over, or even if there had been any trees around the well, you push yourself up into a sitting position. Looking about, seeing only the familiar sights of the park several blocks from your house, you utter, &quot;What the...&quot; but stop upon hearing your voice.<br />
<br />
Higher than what it had been, you aren&#39;t sure which is odder - the way you sound or how you somehow have changed location. Standing, thinking you had to been mistaken by what you heard, you say, &quot;There&#39;s no way my voice could be different,&quot; and cringe at how not only do you sound like a child, but a little girl. Looking down, gasping at how big your clothes now are, you recall the public toilets are on the other side of the park as you start to put your wish and what you see together.<br />
<br />
Taking a couple steps, you stumble and almost pitch yourself forward. Losing in the process first your shoes and socks, then your pants and underwear, you are painfully aware of how you are now down to wearing nothing but an over-sized t-shirt. Whimpering out, &quot;This isn&#39;t what I wanted,&quot; hating the sound of your voice, you drop to the ground, and sitting there, you stare at the clothes you are no longer wearing before, hesitant to do so, you reach up with a hand now much smaller, grab ahold of the collar of your shirt and looking down. Seeing your now seven-year-old female body, you whimper, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a girl, as you are unable to help yourself as you start to cry.<br />
<br />
Not wanting what has happened, but unsure how to undo it, it takes you a moment before the well comes to you. Crying still, you force yourself up, and forgetting you are in the wrong area, as well as the rest of your clothes, you start to walk in the direction you hope shall take you back to the well, rubbing your eyes to brush away the tears after some time.</p>
