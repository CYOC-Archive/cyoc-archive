<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike slowly stirred awake. He hadn't slept well, having a lot of strange dreams, and his throbbing morning wood distracted him. He was vaguely aware that he was spooning someone--had he really been that wild last night? <br />
<br />
Suddenly he remembered what had happened, and his eyes snapped open to see his giant dick lying next to him, the head resting atop his pillow more than a foot above his own head. Mike try to sit up, but as his dick rolled onto his torso he grunted, finding himself weighed down by it.<br />
<br />
Then, without warning, his roommate Brandon entered. Taking a long look at Mike, he burst out laughing: &quot;God, you're really in love with that thing, aren't you? You spoon it every fucking night!&quot; Still laughing, he went into the bathroom and closed the door. Mike was amazed--it seemed like Brandon thought there was nothing strange about his suddenly having a dick almost as big as the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
Finally wrestling his cock out of his face, Mike hefted himself into a sitting position. His cock flopped forward, hanging a foot off the edge of the bed. Mike found that he had to sit with his legs totally splayed to accomodate his giant genitals--and even in that position his balls were forced outward to rest atop his thighs. Still astonished, he gazed up and down the length of his member. The base of it met his abdomen not far below his navel, and it looked as though he truly had a third leg. Indeed, his dick was as wide in circumference as each of his thighs--and his thighs were pretty big and muscular as it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you better hurry--you're gonna be late for that chem test,&quot; Brandon shouted over the sound of his electric razor from behind the bathroom door. Mike's mind reeled. &quot;Dude!&quot; he shouted back, &quot;I can't go out in public looking like this!&quot; &quot;Like what?!&quot; Brandon shouted back, incredulous. &quot;With--with this fucking huge cock!&quot; Mike replied. &quot;How the hell am I even supposed to get around?&quot; <br />
<br />
He heard the razor abruptly turn off; a second later, Brandon stuck his head out the bathroom door, a look of disdain on his face. &quot;I don't know what the fuck drugs you took last night dude, but you're acting really weird. We've been roommates for three years and I've never known you to wear clothes. How would they even fit? And you bought that laundry cart for a reason--because you're too lazy to carry your own dick around even though you know you're perfectly capable of it. Now stop fucking around and go to class. You fail that test and you're out, and I don't want a new roommate.&quot; Brandon slammed the bathroom door closed again.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Mike clumsily pushed his junk out of bed, and nearly toppled out of bed after it. Looking at his dresser, he saw a picture of himself standing next to his girlfriend on the beach, she in a bikini, he standing completely nude, his massive genitals resting in front of him. It finally sank in for Mike that the whole world must think he'd always been this way. He turned toward his full-length mirror. It really would be futile to try to stuff himself into any sort of pants, and even a shirt seemed questionable--he couldn't help notice that his torso and arms looked bulkier, just as if he had put on pounds of muscle through years of carrying his dick around. &quot;Not that it matters,&quot; Mike finally thought, as he opened his dresser to find it totally empty--as Brandon suggested, it seemed as though he had never owned clothes at all.<br />
<br />
Finally, Mike gathered his thoughts enough to remember just how important his test was. Shrugging, he gingerly hefted his cock and balls into the laundry cart next to his bed, and pushed himself out the door.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
As Mike pulled into the lecture hall, he was still amazed that no one stared or said anything about his nudity or anatomical change on the way. But he had little time to think about it, as the test was already being passed out as he arrived. Looking around, he saw there was only one seat left open in the back of the hall. He trundled over to it, but did a double-take when he got there--it was your typical college lecture hall seat, cramped even for a normal person, but extraordinarily daunting to Mike in his current state.<br />
<br />
Gulping, Mike lifted his cock and balls out of the laundry cart. He eased into a sitting position, wincing as his scrotum pinched slightly between his legs. Mike had always been athletic, and already had to sit with his muscular thighs spread apart in any seat. Now he had to stretch even more to accomodate his ball sack. The old cushion of the seat was scratchy and cold on his bare and sinewy ass, and as he finally came into a full sitting position his balls came in contact with the cold, tiled floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I gonna sit like this for an hour?!&quot; Mike silently wondered. His thighs were braced against either side of his chair's alcove. His testicles spilled over in front of him, filling up the whole space between his legs, the floor, and the row of seats in front of him. And his dick, with nowhere else to go, flopped back across his torso, nestling in the space between his pecs and hanging over his shoulder, forcing him to tilt his head to make space for it.<br />
<br />
Very carefully, Mike pulled down the movable desk atop his scrotum, and put down his copy of the test. He began to write, but immediately found that the action of moving his arm was jostling his penis against his chest and head, and the sensation of his hard biceps and pecs and soft hair against his dick drove him wild. Unable to control himself, he dropped his pencil as his dick spasmed and stiffened, reaching far into the air above him; Mike breathed hard and sweated profusely as everyone around him ignored his discomfort and continued writing. Mike felt the cum rise through his dick, taking almost thirty seconds to reach his head; finally, with a great bellow, he came, his dick spewing cum like a great geyser, leaving the back wall of the room spattered with his seed. <br />
<br />
After a minute-long orgasm, Mike finally found himself spent; he then snapped back to reality, and scanned the room, expecting to see faces staring at him, disgusted, but everyone persisted in ignoring the obvious. Dazed, Mike finished his test; as he left the hall at the end of the hour, he noticed a janitor quietly mopping up the back of the room.</p>
