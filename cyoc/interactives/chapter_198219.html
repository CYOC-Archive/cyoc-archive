<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan stared at the ball of tape contemplatively. Now what?<br />
<br />
He raised the gun again, this time sliding the dial to the smallest setting and fired. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And release.<br />
<br />
Again a moment passed and the ball began to shrink. Smaller and smaller, until it seemed to be about the size it was the first time he&#39;d threw it down on the floor. He sighed, relieved. It worked both ways.<br />
<br />
Now a real test...<br />
<br />
He was tempted to fire it at himself first of all but... that seemed too risky. He should really try it on someone else first, but who?<br />
<br />
As he thought about it he could hear his downstairs neighbour&#39;s son in the garden kicking his ball against the wall.<br />
<br />
Archer was about 7 years old and a nice kid, little noisy but sweet. Dan looked out the window down at him thoughtfully. A quick blast... wouldn&#39;t hurt him surely? Shrinking his was a bad idea... he was outside and if it went to far... it could be dangerous. He could grow him... a little, like a short blast... a little one?<br />
<br />
Dan cracked the window a tiny bit and aimed the gun. Was he really willing to test it on his neighbour&#39;s kid... he really shouldn&#39;t... without realising it he pulled the trigger and immediately released. A short beamhut Archer square in the back. Dan was stunned he&#39;d actually done it... well pulled the gun back out of sight and watched intently. Worry and excitement fighting inside him.<br />
<br />
Archer felt nothing, he carried on kicking his ball. He stopped to catch his breath and stretched. And it began. He felt like the world was shifting around him, changing perspective.<br />
<br />
Dan gasped quietly. It was working. The boy started to expand a little. The boy was about 4ft tall from the last time he saw him up close. Even from this angle he could see he was definitely taller than that, not be a huge margin but taller. He was still growing it seemed, he appeared to wobble on his feet a little and then it stopped. From his estimate he was about 5 feet tall ish, though it was hard to tell from this distance. Dan softly giggled to himself.<br />
<br />
Archer meanwhile was looking around the garden confused, everything looked different now. Smaller.<br />
<br />
From his perch above, Dan had a naughty thought... one more quick blast, haha that would be fun, I mean I can shrink him back... no I mustn&#39;t... his lack of control won out.<br />
<br />
He aimed, he fired, and... then... he...released. Fuck that was a good 4 count at least. That was a mistake... that was stupid... that was...<br />
<br />
Exciting!<br />
<br />
Archer felt his world spin again. This time it felt really really weird, and he finally realised what was happening. He was growing. He looked over at the backdoor and it looked, well it looked smaller.<br />
<br />
Dan watched as the boy grew, he was getting past 6 feet easily now, it looked like there was a strange child like man in the garden, in shorts and t shirt, trainers and socks. The blonde hair glinting in the sun. Now easily 7ft tall, the boy was starting to level the top of the fence, and now he was looking over it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... oh...&quot; Archer said as his feet pushed the dirt under him outward as his stance widened. &quot;This feels so cool. Everything is smaller!&quot; He had a big grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Dan watched the boy gain more height from his window, well past 9 feet now, he was nearing his floor... wait... oh...<br />
<br />
Archer looked around and spied his upstairs neighbour through the window watching him. He waved confidently, realising his raised hand was now level with the window. He beamed up at Dan, who looked shocked. &#39;Yea, I&#39;m a giant now, everyone will look like that at me.&#39; The boy giggled. It sounded deeper and louder somehow.<br />
<br />
The boy was still expanding upwards! He was now face to face with Dan&#39;s window, meaning he was at least 16 feet tall...he was 4 times his original height!<br />
<br />
Dan looked the giant boy in the face and waved back slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dan!&quot; Archer said, his voice Louder than Dan expected. &quot;Sorry... I seem to be having a growth spurt.&quot; The boy laughed cheerily. Dan laughed back shyly, looking up at the boy&#39;s face now. He had finally stopped growing, he estimated he must have been 20 feet tall! He looked the boy up and down, he saw the boy&#39;s hands and realised he could pick him up in one pretty easily. Then down to his feet, the were huge! They were easily 3 feet long!<br />
<br />
Archer wiggled his toes in his trainers, making Dan look back up. Archer gave him a knowing smile. &quot;I&#39;m big all over, it&#39;s like I grew everywhere! You look so tint, like a doll, it&#39;s sooooo cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Archer crouched a little to be more face to face with his neighbour. Dan was mesmerised by the giant boy. His hand was still holding the ray gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; Was all Dan could say.</p>
