<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she got on the bus, she looked around and noticed there weren&#39;t many students this morning. It was usual, as most of the students at her school had parents who had the time to drop their teens off in the morning. The other half had a car. She was a year away from being able to drive, which left her in the odd band of misfits taking the bus. It wasn&#39;t that bad, as a few cute guys rode the bus, and she usually got her own seat to unwind before a day of studies.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer sat down and the bus started rolling, she noticed that she had chosen the side of the bus that was catching the sun. It wasn&#39;t in her eyes, but it was making her a little warm on this summer morning. So she spread out across the seat. It wouldn&#39;t do for her to be sweaty before she even reached school. By this time, the jeans that she had left in had changed ever so slightly. Jennifer&#39;s butt had filled out a little bit more, and her jeans had acquired a few tears on them, exposing supple the supple white flesh of her legs. As she sat sideways, dangling one leg over the end of the seat, and the other on the floor, a yawn overcame her. As she stretched, pulling her arms behind her head, she arched her back and her breasts thrust forward. As she finished yawning and opened her eyes, she caught the guy in the seat across from her hastily return to the book he had been reading.<br />
<br />
&#39;A guy like that has been scolded for stealing a peek before&#39; she thought to herself mischievously. So she set about doing everything she could to distract the guy from his book. She started fixing her bra, acting like she wasn&#39;t paying attention, shuffling through her backpack on the floor while giving him ample view of her cleavage. He had a pretty strong game, considering he could easily steal glances over the top of the book. However, could feel every time his increasingly lustful gaze stole a glimpse.<br />
<br />
But then, her fun was over. The bus pulled up to the school, and the students started filing out. After she had bounced down the steps on the way out and started walking toward class, she felt a gentle tap on her shoulder, and a lustful gaze. She knew who it was without even turning around, though she did with a pleasant expression on her face.<br />
<br />
The boy was taken aback. He stammered, &quot;Hey, uh, um, I&#39;m not really good at this, but were you trying to tell me something on the bus? Did you want to maybe hook up before class? We&#39;ve got about fifteen minutes...&quot; he winced, expecting defeat before the question had even landed.<br />
<br />
She thought about it. A little bit of messing around before class was just the thing she needed to start the day off right. &quot;Of course, silly! Why else would I show you so much boob?&quot; She bounced in place. &quot;But we&#39;ve gotta go quick, I actually like my History class!&quot; As if he needed her to say more than yes, he practically kidnapped her and they made their way to the Old Gym. It was under renovation, but the showers still worked. Mostly, it was used by horny teens after school, so there wouldn&#39;t be anyone there this early.<br />
<br />
As they stripped down, she giggled again at the way her boobs bounced out of her top. Almost like they were thanking her for being free. She was a little sweaty still from the bus ride, so she was also thankful for the additional opportunity to clean up. She looked over at the Junior she was about to carelessly hook up with. He was nothing special in physique or style. But she was drawn to the boy who so tenderly watched her on the bus. Despite her glistening mound, she was still rather tight. Sure, she had sex here and there with a few boyfriends, but her cunt was still rather fresh. The student attempted to go straight in, and she gently scolded him. &quot;I like you a lot, but the party is barely started, you gotta warm me up a little! Don&#39;t you know how a vagina works?&quot; The student&#39;s eyes narrowed, then a grin spread to his lips. &quot;Like this?&quot; He began rubbing his cock up and down her slit.<br />
<br />
If Jennifer was moist before, she became Niagra Falls in comparison. The boy, seeing his opportunity, began to slowly push his way inside. Each thrust further and quicker. Jennifer moaned, her breasts rocking with each pump, the sounds of their lovemaking masked by the running water. Then, as quickly as it started, it was over in an explosion of pleasure. The student had reached his limit, and her body responded equally. They both rode the waves of pleasure to their completion, a thin stream of female cum streaming out of Jennifer as the student removed his dick. Then, their phone alarm went off and they realized that they only had about five minutes to get to class. As Jennifer cleaned up and toweled off, she reflected how fun he had been. It had clearly been fun for him too, &quot;So uh...when can we do this again? Are we, like, dating now...?&quot; He said with puppy dog eyes.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t mind letting him down. &quot;Sorry! I just thought you deserved a little more than a peep show. But now you have a story to tell all your friends! Just don&#39;t feel jealous if you catch me with anyone else, ok?&quot; She said with a wink, as she stuffed herself into her DD-cup bra. Her jeans felt a little tight, but she reminded herself that she was wearing skinny jeans. &#39;A juicy booty like mine needs to be tightly preserved!&#39; she thought, as she got her shoes on and finished drying her hair. She didn&#39;t notice more designer tears, exposing the flesh around her waist and crotch area, only completely covering the most important asset.<br />
<br />
She quickly made her way to her History class. Learning about ancient cultures was fun for Jennifer. She loved learning the different notions ancient cultures had about sex!</p>
