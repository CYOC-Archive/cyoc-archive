<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Virginia was busy helping Harold complete his transformation into a were-tiger; the un-named deputy just stared at Alice Decrux as she futilely struggles to free herself from the bonds that Dean Myer put her in earlier.<br />
“I’m not surprised,” the deputy staring at the were-raccoon; “I knew one day you would try your tricks with the next normal that crossed your path. You think I’ve forgotten what you did to my brother a decade ago?”<br />
“It was a misunderstanding,” Alice looking fearful; “besides it’s not as if he enjoyed my company.”<br />
“You turned him into a were-raccoon,” the deputy growling; “what’s more you got pregnant because of it.”<br />
“It was consensual,” Alice hissing in return; “and last I checked, it’s not against the law to get knocked up with a one night stand.”<br />
“You tried to sue George for child support,” the deputy still growling; the werewolf in him wanting to come out. “He was still in high school, or did you forget that part!”<br />
“Whatever,” Alice being dismissive; “I got off on the statue 1A charges.”<br />
“Yet you lost your child support suit,” the Deputy grinning; “and on top of that you lost custody of the daughter you two created. You may have got lucky with the courts when messing with my brother; but don’t think your prior bad acts won’t come to bite you as you are made to answer for this incident.”<br />
“Harold’s scratch was an accident,” Alice snapping back; “if anyone is culpable of statue 1A, its Virginia who we can hear getting plowed by Harold.”<br />
<br />
The Deputy just stares at Alice as he and the other deputies arriving can hear the growling and roaring of two were-tigers rutting. Unable to do anything but listen as they all hear a loud masculine roar, rattling windows and causing the birds to cease their chirping. At first there was silence and then a single clap could be heard; followed by another until a few started to cheer as everyone knew that the normal person involved in the altercation between two female weres was now a strong virile were-tiger. The only hold out to the celebration was Alice Decrux as she cry; her whimpering cutting through the din of cheers and applause.<br />
“Accident or not,” the deputy turning back to the tearful Alice; “Harold is now a were-tiger. Forever beyond your grasping paws,” The deputy removing Alice’s bonds and being assisted by another deputy to cuff her; “just like my brother George and your daughter Jessica Leprue.”<br />
<br />
Alice felt like she was hit in gut; hearing that her daughter Jessica is being called Leprue and not Decrux as she was being escorted into a police cruiser with tinted windows. The windows darkened because she was still in here were-raccoon fursona; the doors closing shut as Deputy Leprue just shakes his head.<br />
“And hear I’d thought Miss Decrux would have finally smartened up after her plan to milk by younger brother backfired.”<br />
“I never found that out,” Dean Myers approaching the deputy; “it was absent in the file I put together on her for Harold.”<br />
“My brother was still a minor,” Deputy Leprue answering; “as such the records were sealed to protect him and Jessica. After today,” Deputy Leprue looking at the man in a large oversized bathrobe; “Miss Decrux will not be able to dodge whatever bullet is rocketing towards her.”<br />
“If I have any say,” Dean Myers looking at the police cruiser containing the were-raccoon; “I’ll make sure the court is aware of her prior bad acts.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Harold Jenkins, now a fully transformed were-tiger was lying in bed enjoying the afterglow of his first orgasm as a were. No strange to having sex in the past; Harold was blown away at how enjoyable it became when he coupled with Virginia. Finding his senses now highly acute; Harold was surprised at how easy it was to see in the darkened bedroom. Despite the curtains drawn and very little light getting in; Harold was able to make out every detail of every piece of furniture in his bedroom as if it was a bright sunny day. His newly sense of smell was also surprising him; clearly smelling Virginia’s own were-tigress scent and finding it very pleasing. Harold could also detect the lingering scent of his old human self as well of the lingering scent of his daughter in the air. The hamburger patties he had defrosting in the kitchen for supper could also be detected and it caused his new body to react accordingly to the smell of raw meat; Harold instinctively licked his lips like a feline as he purred, enjoying the smells invading his nose.<br />
<br />
“This is going to take some getting used to,” Harold speaking in a gruffer voice.<br />
“It’s like being reborn,” Virginia rubbing her paws up and down Harold’s furry body; purring as she finds the new were-tiger an amazing specimen of masculinity. “I remember my first transformation,” Virginia giving Harold a loving lick on the muzzle; “I was on over drive with my senses. I suspect you are undergoing the same feeling.”<br />
“I’m also having a craving,” Harold growling lowly; “a craving for meat. Lots of it.”<br />
“The down side of being a were,” Virginia speaking; “at least for some, is that you have a larger than usual appetite. It takes a lot of energy to shift back and forth; you’ll find your grocery budget skyrocketing as a result.”<br />
“Any suggestions,” Harold spooning Virginia; “despite it just being me and Melissa, money is a bit tight at the moment.”<br />
“Some were’s supplement their diet with wild game,” Virginia answering; “I do. There are night’s I’m out in the woods hunting for a few rabbits. Now and then the were-tiger pride I belong to will kill a buck or a bull moose and we’ll make a meal of it. There is nothing more satisfying then going to bed with a belly full of meat.”<br />
“I don’t know how to hunt,” Harold sighing; “think you can teach me?”<br />
“Sure,” Virginia purring; “I can give you the basics, but your inner tiger will help you with the rest. You just got to let those instincts out for a bit.”<br />
<br />
Harold growls happily; rapidly getting used to being a were, despite the incident that brought him to his current situation. Seeing his feet now digitigrade paws with orange fur, Harold couldn’t help but smile as he flexed his paws; watching the retractable claws popping out and back in. Harold wanted to explore his new body further when a knock on the door brought him out of his happy moment.<br />
“Harold Jenkins,” Harold could hear thanks to his excellent new hearing; “this is Chief O’Hara. I need to ask you and Virginia McCoy a few questions. Can you let us in?”<br />
<br />
“Us,” Harold looking at Virginia; “Who other than the police chief would want to talk to us?”<br />
“We better get up,” Virginia pulling herself from Harold; his new barbed cock still in her. She sighs as the barbs tickle her canal giving her another orgasm; looking at Harold as he looks confused, she just purrs as she helps him up off the bed.<br />
“Sorry,” Harold looking at his new member for the first time; “is this normal?”<br />
“For a were-tiger,” Virginia seeing Harold’s new feline penis slowly retreat into his new sheath; “it’s perfectly normal. You’ll get use to your new anatomy in time,” Virginia chuckling; “right now let’s see who else other than Chief O’Hara wants to talk to us.”<br />
<br />
Harold watches as Virginia puts on the robe she had on earlier and sees her shifting back to her human self. Harold grabbing a bathrobe he had; he finds it doesn’t even fit him. In fact most of his clothes will now barely fit him; not realizing that until he shifts back to his human form and seeing his new buff and younger self for the first time. Harold just grumbles as he tries to cover up his new manhood with a large towel instead.<br />
“Chief O’Hara,” Harold hears Virginia answering; “Dean Meyers.”<br />
“Thanks for opening the door,” Chief O’Hara answering; “I thought it best to have our town chancellor join us. Miss Tachibana is also here after hearing about the altercation. Is Harold still upstairs?”<br />
“He is,” Virginia responding; “still getting used to being a were.”<br />
“Then perhaps you can answer a few of our questions,” Samantha answering; “while Dean Myers here was a witness to the altercation we need to investigate every aspect.”<br />
“This is a potential Statue 1A violation,” Tachibana responding; “we expect your full co-operation.”<br />
<br />
Harold hearing every word thanks to his excellent hearing; sighing as he couldn’t find a towel large enough to wrap around his waist, he walks by the large mirror as he heads downstairs. Pausing as he takes a good look at himself for the first time, Harold was surprised at his new looks. A large bipedal tiger with traditional orange fur with black stripes everywhere except for his abdomen and chest. Brilliant white fur their and inside his new ears on the top of his head; Harold could not help but stare at pink nose at the end of his muzzle. Whiskers poking out of his upper lip while his lower lip is speckled with white and black fur; his golden eyes with black pupils made him look menacing as he open his maw displaying his large rogue tongue and sharp canines.<br />
<br />
Holding a paw up in front of him, Harold looks at the orange fur covering his paw and fingers; flexing his paw and watching the razor sharp claws pop out and back in. Repeating the process a few times as the muscles in his body tense and flex. Enjoying the sensation; Harold can’t help but chuckle. Taking one final look in the mirror, he gazes down towards his crotch. His eyes widen as his testicles and scrotal sac are defiantly bigger than they were this morning; covered in a fine coat of white fur as he can’t help but caress his enlarged endowment, seeing his member tucked away in a protective sheath.<br />
“I can’t deny that I don’t look stunning,” Harold quietly chuckling to himself. Done looking at himself, Harold turns to the stairs; his tail swishing as he calmly walks down to the living room where Virginia was busy talking to Chief O’Hara, Samantha Twist and Tachibana.</p>
