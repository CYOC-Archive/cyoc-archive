<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Outside, she went for the small park near her place where people often gathered during the day. There were benches here and there, surrounded by trees and green grass. Right now though, it was empty save for two women sitting on a bench, talking. <br />
<br />
One wore sunglasses and had her arms crossed. Her posture was straight and on her head sat shoulder length brown hair. Small tits, hidden behind a black shirt marked her chest, A-cups if Selene were to guess. Her legs stood still as she talked, her skirt and white flats staying in place.<br />
<br />
The other sat with her legs spread apart, leaning backwards slightly, confident. Her blonde hair was done in a braid and falling down her blue jacket to her small waist, ending above her blue jeans. Selene approached them slowly, listening intently. <br />
<br />
The one in the glasses spoke. &quot;So, I&#39;ve been thinking about getting implants. You know, making my tis bigger, that stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second woman nodded. &quot;Yeah, my sister has hers done. They look great! But they cost an arm and a leg.&quot; However she stopped talking as soon as Selena walked by. The woman stared at the girl, scanning her from up and down, disbelief clearly written on her face, her partner joined her to in the staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Selene asked, fighting to keep a smile of her face, &quot;never seen a girl before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like you,&quot; responded the brunette, not taking her gaze off the girl&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then why don&#39;t we get to know each other?&quot; Selene offered, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thanks uh.. goodbye!&quot; replied the brunette, quickly rising from her seat and soon walking away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait wait wait!&quot; Selene called out after her &quot;I can help you with the implants!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both women turned around and looked at the girl, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;How the fuck do you want to do that?&quot; That was the question, was is not?<br />
<br />
&quot;With magic!&quot; answered Selene confidently, &quot;that&#39;s how I got to be the jailbait to end all jailbaits!&quot;<br />
<br />
They raised their eyebrows. It was clear both girls didn&#39;t believe her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please? Just let me try to make your boobies big!&quot; pleaded Selene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay fine. If it doesn&#39;t work, go away!&quot; was her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you! Now lets begin!&quot; said the purple haired child and crossed her fingers as she began to whisper, &quot;her boobs grow as big as she wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
She waited in silence until suddenly the brunette gasped loudly, covering her mouth and looking at her breasts as grew to B-cups. Her nipples showed through her shirt, as if she had no bra underneath it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; exclaimed the her friend &quot;you didn&#39;t lie&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I didn&#39;t! Look!&quot; continued Selene pointed at the still growing breasts of the woman. Both watched amazed as her breasts grew further and further into C-cup, almost reaching D-Cup size.<br />
<br />
Elated, the newly busty woman walked to Selena and hugged her. &quot;Thank you so much, this is amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; said Selene and hugged back. Their tist together felt amazing. After a few moments, she stepped back and introduced herself properly. &quot;My name is Selene. As you noticed I have some magic up my sleeve&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Rebecca,&quot; answered the blonde, &quot;and this is Sarah my girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
All three smiled and shook hands.<br />
<br />
Sarah had a sugesstion, &quot;how would you like to join ... us?&quot; her voice faltered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That does sound wrong does it not? Two twenty-somethings inviting a little girl to their place.&quot; Said Rebecca, &quot;don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t force you or anything. We just thought maybe you&#39;d enjoy spending time with us and as a thank you, and apology, from us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sounds fun,&quot; she said. She wasn&#39;t sure what exactly she would do there, but it could not hurt. And besides, she wanted to see more of those new boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; enthused Rebecca &quot;let&#39;s go then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two girls led the way while Selene followed close behind. It was not a long walk, as soon they were already at an apartment block and  Sarah turned a key and let them in.<br />
<br />
Inside the living room, the couch was pushed against the wall and there was a large wooden coffee table, covered in various magazines. Left and right from it were nice leather chairs. A flatscreen tv stood at the other end of the room, looking like new.<br />
<br />
All three sat down together and Sarah immediately made herself comfortable in the chair. Rebecca meanwhile went over to the kitchen and brought back drinks for everyone, cola for the young guest and bottles of beer for the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheers ladies,&quot; Sarah said, raising her glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheers,&quot; said the the other two and they all clanked their glass bottles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are your parents, anyway?&quot; asked Rebecca.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re on vacation right now.&quot; replied the little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; asked Rebecca &quot;where did they go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; answered the purple-haired girl, &quot;they just told me to stay here and take care of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like my kind of family!&quot; laughed Sarah and sipped some of her beer, &quot;so tell me about yourself, what are your hobbys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... well... I play games a lot...&quot; started Selene after putting her bottle down , &quot;and watch anime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; exclaimed the blonde, &quot;is that where you took your looks from?&quot; her hand gestured at the teenagers&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Selene blushed, it sure does look that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by &#39;looks&#39;?&quot; asked Rebecca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know... the purple hair, the huge boobs...&quot; the her partner started counting on her fingers, &quot;the only thing&#39;s missing are the huge eyes and high-pitched japanese.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca laughed out loud at that. &quot;Yeah, I guess you could say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about you?&quot; asked Selene, &quot;are you a gamers too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well I am.&quot; replied Rebecca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? What sort of games?&quot; asked the young girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, mostly first person shooters lately. But I used to be into RPGs and adventure stuff when I was younger.&quot; admitted Rebecca, &quot;Sarah meanwhile just calls it all &#39;nerd stuff&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s true!&quot; the guilty party said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t knock it until you try it!&quot; said Rebecca.<br />
<br />
Both girls laughed heartily at that exchange. Selene liked these two; they seem like really cool people.</p>
