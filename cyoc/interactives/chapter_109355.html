<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hot Jewish doctor that Allison had met the night of Logan&#39;s suicide attempt, Eliza Forestenzer, scooted Julia out of the way as she walked into her patient&#39;s bedroom to check on her vitals and well being, and had to smirk as she saw the two teenagers involved in an athletic evening under the sheets. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Elizabeth had nightmares that night of Robbie laid out on a bed in  pitch blackness, being penetrated with a strap on by some ravening female at work taking advantage of Robbie&#39;s depression and impaired mental state after the Great Change. Rob had been an impulsive person as a man, why would she not be as a woman? Liz turned in bed, her tears moistening her pillow case. Elizabeth hadn&#39;t been a loud, messy crier like Robbie had been, whose sobbing could be audibly heard. Elizabeth&#39;s anguish remained mostly on the inside, letting her fears consume her. <br />
<br />
She awoke to the rays of light coming through the windows in the master bedroom. Judging by their position, Elizabeth had guessed that it was still pretty early, no later than 6:30 A.M. She turned her body around to go wake up Billie for school. Elizabeth had been planning on attending the Kiss Off to support Billie&#39;s teacher Ms. Aaronsohn, whom Elizabeth had met many times before as a man and was on friendly terms with. She had hoped to maybe do it with Robbie, but if she was going to have an affair, then maybe Liz should too. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she saw Robbie laying in bed, snoring quietly, her hair all tussled and still wearing the dress she wore to work the previous day. Her lipstick and mascara were smeared all over her face. Elizabeth&#39;s resting bitch face furrowed a little, and she went to the bathroom. Pouring herself a glass of water, Elizabeth returned to the bedroom and splashed the water on Robbie&#39;s face. That woke her up...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; she asked a bit hoarsely, shocked by the water treatment. She was still disoriented for a minute until she saw Elizabeth standing over her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened last night?&quot; asked Elizabeth, acid in her voice.<br />
<br />
Robbie began coughing into her perfectly manicured hand for a minute and wiped her forehead with her other hand, clearly still not all there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I...I...:<br />
<br />
The phone rang.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth picked up. It was Lucretia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Elizabeth, this is Lucretia. We&#39;ve met before, I&#39;m a friend of your wife&#39;s at work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak of the devil&quot; said Elizabeth quietly. &quot;So what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; said Lucretia quietly. She was clearly nervous over having this conversation. &quot;Your home life is none of my business, but over a coffee break yesterday, Robbie had been complaining to me that she wasn&#39;t feeling appreciated at home, that she cries herself to sleep every night. I invited her out for a drink, maybe to call her nerves a little, and she got absolutely sloshed. She came onto me in the parking lot, tried to force me to have sex with her in my car. I&#39;m going to be honest with you, I REALLY REALLY wanted to. Your wife is so hot, but I couldn&#39;t do it, because it&#39;s wrong, so I drove her home. I took her house keys and unlocked the door, and I dropped her off in your bedroom because she was in no condition to get home herself. She was tripping every third step, and she was looking to bang the first broad that crossed her field of vision. I&#39;m sorry for entering your home unawares, but I swear I didn&#39;t touch anything and I&#39;ll never invade your privacy again. Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Lucretia hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, my hair&#39;s a mess&quot; moaned Robbie, self consciously worrying about her looks for the first time as she stared in the mirror, slowly getting over her hangover. Elizabeth looked conflicted at her. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever been to Disneyland?&quot; asked Jean. &quot;I never got to go as a kid, and I still have never been. You know, receptionist&#39;s salery. Can we go, please?&quot; begged the women, holding her hands, fingers interlaced out to her wife. &quot;And it&#39;ll be fun to drive there, seeing the country.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greta stared at her wife. &quot;Hmm. Well, I suppose. It would be an experience, and we would be spending all of our times together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we get to see our work up close!&quot; cheered Jean. Jean had been a lifelong bisexual woman, but after many years of bad relationships with men, including one extremely abusive one, she had grown bitter and disdainful of the entire gender except for very small boys, and even they, Jean knew, would just grow up to be men. Joe&#39;s perverted little shenanigan with the magic ring had just been the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Seeing a world full of femininity for the first time was exciting to her, versus just reading about it online and watching it on TV.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Martha watched with a bemused smile on her face as her former husband Kyle, now wife Kayla, eagerly embraced her new role as &quot;mommy&quot; as she played with little Jo. Kayla had fallen in love with the feral girl, using what was left of her pension to buy Jo toys, games, and decorations for her new bedroom. Martha had been wondering how they would be able to explain to the authorities about this, and didn&#39;t want Kayla to give her hopes up. Odds are, they wouldn&#39;t be able to keep the baby girl. <br />
<br />
Kayla had a huge, warm smile on her face as little Jo went for her new alphabet blocks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to spell Mommy a word?&quot; she asked to Jo. Jo nodded her baby head vigorously. <br />
<br />
Jo had spent the previous night staring at the blocks, waiting with nervous anticipation over when she&#39;d finally get to unleash her plan. She had been afraid that if she had climbed back down the crib bars the previous night, she would have been caught and never  be allowed out of Kayla&#39;s benevolent but Orwellian sight again. Privacy, Jo felt, was paramount. She needed as much of it as possible to plot and experiment with different means of escape. So she may as well send out her S.O.S signal during play time. <br />
<br />
She gathered her blocks and began to assemble them. Kayla watched with glee as she watched her little pride and joy spell out something...something.<br />
<br />
GRETA<br />
<br />
&quot;Greta?&quot; asked Martha from the doorway. &quot;Where&#39;d she learn that name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; wondered Kayla herself. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s her mother&#39;s name?&quot; she suggested. Martha gave a disbelieving sound. They watched as Jo got busy as a beaver assembling her next word, her little baby hands only able to carry one block at a time.<br />
<br />
VON<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I think our Jo here might be gifted&quot; said Kayla, turning to her wife. &quot;Remember Clever Hans, that horse that could do arithmetic and read and write back in the early 20th century?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha huffed. &quot;I&#39;m not THAT old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he could!&quot; whined Kayla childishly. &quot;I remember my father telling me about how he met Clever Hans once. He said he introduced him to my mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha was about to retort as Jo spelled out the final word in her sequence: HAUSER. <br />
<br />
GRETA VON HAUSER. Jo then stopped spelling and turned to face her two foster mothers.<br />
<br />
