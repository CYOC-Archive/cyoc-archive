<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you stare at the mask, you hardly notice a football freshman rush break from his lineup with the other recruits and walk toward you confidently. He carries a smirk on his face as he walks past Nick and the other frat bros stands squarely in front you. &quot;Hey Frosh!&quot; he shouts. You look up to him. &quot;What&#39;s up man? I&#39;m Nate, I&#39;m a football player, a halfback, and your mask is now mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were staring at his massive flaccid dick underneath his grey boxer briefs. The jock was huge. He didn&#39;t have massively defined muscles, but he was well built and thick. His quads were square and his dick was pushed straight down in his boxer briefs. He had a thin treasure trail up from his waistband to his chest, and a thin layer of hair over his pecs. <br />
<br />
You were paying too much attention admiring the jock&#39;s body that you hardly noticed when he slipped the mask right out from your hands and cupped them into his own. &quot;Mine now, nerd!&quot; he shouted, laughing while the other upperclass frat bros applauded his aggression. &quot;Nice one, Nate!&quot; they shouted. &quot;Now, try that thing on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate saw his whole act as one big charade, just something to show his alpha-ness, until he looked down at the mask and saw the same hypnotic green glow that you saw before. &quot;Woah, holy shit!&quot; he says with a smile. &quot;This thing might be really something!&quot; he said again, looking down at the glow, turning it to look at the angles before pushing it toward his face.<br />
<br />
You try to run after the mask but Nick and two other upperclassmen stop you, holding you back as Nate steps back. You see the dick in his shorts harden from his excitement. &quot;I&#39;ll try this thing on!&quot; he shouts, looking back up at the rest of the frat as he slowly starts to lift it toward his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOO!&quot; You shout, you don&#39;t know what will happen but you figure it won&#39;t be good for you. But Nate isn&#39;t listening to anyone anymore. He pushes the mask toward him until it finally leaps out of his hands and onto his face. Grabbing and sucking onto his chiseled face and liquefying over his head. The mask spreads its tendrils out and liquefies and spreads over his head. &quot;What the!?&quot; was the last thing that Nate shouted before his mouth was muffled by the mask, cracking a bright, electric spark of green energy as strange and supernatural runes emanate from the mask. He grabs the head of the mask but its of no use, it&#39;s clinging onto him too much, push its power into him in ways that you and the frat cannot comprehend.<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s body soon begins to twist and contort. The mask was somehow pushing power into the jock because his already built body began to grow outward. His pecs flattened and pushed out as his abs contorted and chiseled out, becoming the mediocre six pack that he had into a well-defined, deeply grooved eight-pack. His adonis curved inward and chiseled as his back expanded and grew upward, his biceps and triceps sculpting as veins began to pop out and muscle hardened and grew. <br />
<br />
Part of Nate was beginning to panic as he ran away from you clawing at the mask, but part of him was really growing to like it too. He stopped as his back was turned to you and you noticed his ass muscles underneath his gray boxer briefs spasm, his already strong butt shaking and quaking as new layers of muscle began to grow over it. You saw the side of his ass cheek lock in as it pushed outward, the flesh becoming rock solid as it pushed hard against the underwear. Soon his quads followed, locking in as it spread down from his butt and into his glutes, pushing outward. He turned back around as the green mask began to wrap over his head, completely thinned out and in a glowing, bright green wrap over his head. &quot;FUCK YEAH!&quot; the new being shouted, his dick now thicker than ever and growing a full-on erection, precum starting to soak the front of the briefs. &quot;I am a GOD! FUCK YES THIS FEELS GOOD!&quot; he shouted again before some otherworldly power completely took over for him. <br />
<br />
Nate turned back around and stretched his back, snapping his briefs and leaving his expanding but growing body  naked and growing ever-stronger. Now completely naked, Nate was free of clothing and open to the powers of the mask, and the act of getting naked seemed to immediately cause the powers of the mask to spin him into a violent tornado. &quot;WEEYEAH!&quot; you hear him shout underneath the tornado as outlines of his skeletal form spark in and out of existence as he continues to grow and contort. Nate skips and spins around each of his fellow frat rushes, ripping their own boxers and briefs off as a mischievous being, a god that he has become, cackling as he gains the powers to do whatever he wants.<br />
<br />
He picked up his pace, racing around the room as his powers grew within him. You pull back in fear, worried about what he&#39;s going to do next.</p>
