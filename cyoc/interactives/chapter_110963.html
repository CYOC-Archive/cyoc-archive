<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tachibana No Akane, a were-vixen; silently makes her way to the central dais of the council chamber. Seeing the rest of the council members present and in their fursonas; only Andrew the wer-mer rep still wearing his with robe but in his stage two form sitting in his seat. Tachibana scowls as several council members are sipping coffee in the room. Giving a few council members dirty looks for violating the no food or drink rule during session; Randolph the werewolf rep who was also drinking a cup of joe was the only were to dare shoot back a dirty look at Tachibana’s way.<br />
<br />
Raising her paws in the air to signify that the session has begun, Tachibana starts to speak.<br />
“This session is now in order. I would like to remind council members that there is a strict no food or drink policy in place when council is in session. So I don’t want to see most of you drinking coffee in this room again.”<br />
“Then stop with these early morning sessions,” Randolph quips.<br />
You of all,” Tachibana growls; “know how serious the matter we sit here for today. We have a Statue 1A trial to conclude as well as trying a werewolf pack and their Alpha for the murder of Alyssa Cooper.”<br />
“Don’t forget,” Andrew pipes up; “Julie Stovall committing murder and escaping the building yesterday.”<br />
“If its all the same to everyone,” Lance Knight getting up; “I would prefer to deal with Julie Stovall and then break for the weekend. We can always deal with the Luna Brotherhood refreshed on Monday.”<br />
“Now that is sensible request,” Leon Talbot bristling; “I move we vote upon it now.”<br />
“And what of Douglas Cooper,” Tachibana booming; “what of him wanting swift justice served. Do you want to draw straws to see who is stuck with the task with telling the grieving were-grizzly that finding the truth regarding his cousin’s death will have to wait? Will that same council rep also inform Alyssa Cooper’s five year old son who is on his way here as we speak?”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile; Joan was having a hell of a time getting Darrell to calm down on the private jet they just boarded. Wanting to play and not wanting to settle down; she had to shift to her were-tigress fursona just to get him to sit still.<br />
“Furry Joan,” Darrell beams as he grabs small handfuls of fur, while she gets the kids belt secured.<br />
Thankful that the flight crew was all weres and that this flight was provided by the Luna Brotherhood; Joan sits in the seat next to Darrell, just as the flight attendant who was a were-vixen approaches and offers her a water and a juice box for Darrell.<br />
“We will soon take off,” the flight attendant speaks; “and will arrive in Seattle in a few hours. If you want I can put on a cartoon or two to keep the child distracted for the time being.”<br />
“Thank you,” Joan sighs; “Darrell likes Yogi Bear or any of the old Hanna Barbera cartoons.”<br />
“I’ll see what I have then,” The flight attendant answering before heading back to the front of the small leer jet they were on.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
While most of the council knew how to handle Douglas Cooper, it was the revelation that the late Alyssa having a son that did not sit well with them. With several mumbling and muttering about having to spend another day away from their jobs or families for that matter, most started to resign themselves to what was looking to be another grueling session. All but Lance Knight; standing up as he addresses the council.<br />
“Would it not make sense to deal with the Luna Chapter situation after the weekend? Do we need to have a child, who would not begin to comprehend what is going on have to sit in a strange and foreboding place just for the sake of justice? I don’t know about you, but the best thing we could do right now is let Alyssa’s son be looked after by her cousin for the time being when he gets here. Meanwhile we attend to the matter of Ms. Stovall and then all go back to our families and prior commitments.”<br />
“Very well spoken,” Randolph responding; “my mate would very much appreciate me back at our cozy cabin; especially since she is due any day now with our first cub.”<br />
“You took a mate,” Tachibana looking shocked; “you the council’s and town’s local grump found love.”<br />
“I’m not a perpetual grump,” Randolph answering; “I’m just a private werewolf that likes his peace and quiet and a decent location in which to paint.”<br />
“Do you know if it’s a boy or a girl,” Leon asking.<br />
“Don’t know,” Randolph answering; “my mate chose to have a furry pregnancy; she has not shifted from her werewolf fursona since our last coupling. We also chose to have a home birth.”<br />
“So if she hasn’t given birth yet,” Tachibana glumly answering.<br />
“Don’t expect me to be come in on Monday,” Randolph finishing her sentence; “I will be with my mate comforting her. And if you send any of your Skulk agents to try and drag me from my cabin-”<br />
“Point taken,” Tachibana sighing; “All in favor of settling the matter involving Julie Stovall and holding off on Alyssa Cooper’s murder at the paws of the Luna brother hood, raise your paws.”<br />
Tachibana sees the paw of every council member raised and sighs; “then it’s unanimous. Let us all break for fifteen minutes and then begin with Julie’s sentence.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
As the break went by quick and the council members retook their seats, followed by Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight being escorted to two additional seats set aside for them. Tachibana announces for the guards to bring in Julie Stovall. Eric and Frieda seeing Julie in prison issue leg irons and shackles being escorted by Daisuke and Yamoto as well as Julie’s lawyer; the two were-panthers naturally give off a low growl, unhappy that she is in the same room as them. Frieda’s uncle Lance who was sitting nearby looked at the two and stared at them; silently telling Eric and Frieda to compose themselves while they are here.<br />
<br />
“Before we begin with your sentence,” Tachibana staring at Julie; “I must inform you that you have been found guilty of two counts of violation the town’s Statue 1A.”<br />
“You mean attempted violation,” Julie snapping back; “Eric over there is a not a wer-mer. So my attempts never succeeded.”<br />
“The law was written that no such distinction,” Tachibana staring that the child coldly; “was made to discern attempt and actual deed. So by that, I say again. You have been found guilty of two counts of violation the town’s Statue 1A.”<br />
“Do I have to stand and listen to you drone on,” Julie rolling her eyes; “or are you going to tell me what my sentence is. But before you snap back at me, I would like to inform you all that while the werewolf prisoners you have in the cells were treated to a decent breakfast, I have yet to have anything to eat. I’m not going to be here all quite like when I have yet had breakfast.”<br />
“That’s because,” Andrew shouting; “that Debbie was well like among the staff. I’m not surprised they are upset over you killing her and leaving the poor woman in an undignified manner in the woman’s washroom.”<br />
“That’s no excuse to deny a prisoner basic rights,” Brett snarling; “if my client is being mistreated, then you and anyone else here are in for a world of hurt.”<br />
“Silence,” Tachibana snarling; “all of you! The manner of being denied food will be looked at; but right now we have a sentencing issues to deal with. Then,” Tachibana looking at Julie; “we discuss your murder and escape charges.”<br />
“If you want my client’s co-operation regarding testifying to Alyssa Cooper’s murder,” Brett speaking; “then you better not lock my client away for life.”<br />
“Julie was found guilty of statue 1A,” Randolph shouting; “you don’t expect us to just let her walk out the front door now do you?”<br />
“Thanks for the offer,” Brett sneering at the werewolf; “we’ll take it as a condition of her co-operation.”<br />
“Like hell you will,” Eric growling; “Julie should be locked away for the crimes she tried to commit on me. As the primary victim, do I not have a say in how long she rots behind bars?”<br />
“You will get your chance,” Tachibana scolding the young were-panther; “but now is not the time for outbursts.” Looking at Brett Smithson; “or trying to hamstring this council with threats of not co-operating with our next matter.”<br />
“Its not a threat,” Brett stating; “it’s a guarantee.”<br />
“Then how is this for a guarantee then,” Tachibana growling; “we have video evidence of Julie witnessing Alyssa’s murder at the paws of the Luna brotherhood. So if she doesn’t want to cooperate then that’s fine; we’ll just hand her off to the prison where she will spend possibly her entire life there and still break in time for lunch. We also have her murder charges to deal with as well. We&#39;ll have her tried in absentia for that well if you&#39;d like.”<br />
“Do your worst then,” Julie scoffing; “but you must ask yourself this. Where is Sheriff Cooper,” Julie grinning malevolently; “where did he go after talking to me this morning.”</p>
