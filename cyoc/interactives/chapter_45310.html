<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim woke up feeling sore all over his body. Opening his eyes, he saw it was in the morning, and sunlight was entering through the window. He had a sinking feeling inside, but couldn't put a finger on why he was feeling that way, only noticing how uncomfortable he was in whatever position he was lying on the bed, and moved under the blankets only to feel that something was wrong with his clothes. With a quick motion, he lifted up the blankets, exposing his body. At first, he thought his eyes were lying to him, and rubbed them with a gloved hand. A lump formed on his throat, all of the memories from the last night appeared on his mind at once. From the heeled boots to the corset, he was still clad from head to toe on the last of the outfits that appeared on him. He was feeling like almost crying again, and sat up on his bed, taking some time to gather the force he needed to stay calm. <br />
<br />
That moment, the sound of people in the first floor startled him. With a cringe, Jim thought how he was going to explain everything to his parents and how they would react when they saw him like that. The first thought was of  trying to hide out of fear, but he knew that was currently impossible. Someone would enter his room sooner or later, and they'll find him out. He reasoned that the best but hardest thing to do was just telling them, as they would find out one way or another. Getting up of the bed, Jim took a couple of steps and reached the door to the corridor without losing his balance too much, the hours spent last night helping him on moving in the heels somewhat easier. He opened the door and walked down the corridor and the stairs, the rug muffling his steps. With his heart pounding as hard as ever inside his chest, he began to shake a bit when he could clearly heard his parents chatter coming from the kitchen. Holding his breath, he moved until he was under the door's frame, in clear view of his parents.<br />
<br />
His father was reading a newspaper, while his mother was washing some dishes by the sink, with her back turned to him. The first one to notice Jim was his father, that looked up from the paper and greeted him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mornin', Jim. Did you-&quot; he began, but immediately stopping, noticing how his son was dressed. Jim's mother, on her part, just said &quot;Hello, dear&quot; and turned around partially, still holding a plate. Upon seeing him, she let go of the plate she had in her hands and to the crashing sound on the floor joined a shriek. It followed a couple of long seconds, in which the kitchen fell in total-silence except for the sound of the water running. Jim's parents just looked at him, while Jim just remained still, experiencing the most embarrassing moment of his life. Her mother was the first one in saying something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim? What... How... I-I don't understand.&quot; she said, looking seriously confused and worried at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand it, neither,&quot; answered Jim, trying his best to not stutter and stay calm. He was feeling like the first time his clothes changed, when he passed out, and he didn't want that to happen, not before he could explain. &quot;You are not going to believe me, but it's something I do not believe myself yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, explain. I just...&quot; said his mother, but couldn't end the sentence.<br />
<br />
Jim then proceeded to tell his parents the events from the last night, omitting the fact everything started with a lingerie catalog. It was weird how, even in a moment like this, he just couldn't admit to be masturbating in front of his parents. He explained how the lingerie, makeup and jewelry appeared on him by itself in seconds, how it was painful not to wear high heels, and how everything he put on changed to skimpy women clothes.<br />
<br />
When he ended, his father looked a bit skeptical, and just remained silent, but his mother went to him and gave him a hug. &quot;I don't know if all of this is true or not, but you are my son and I'll support you.&quot; said his mother, &quot;I don't know if we can get you out of this, but we will have to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim just nodded, somewhat relieved that his mother reacted that way, but knew that everything was going to be futile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother is right, we will support you, no matter what.&quot; said Jim's father, saying the first words since he entered in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go to your room, ok?&quot; asked his mother, and helped him in the way to the second floor. Once there, his mother told him to wait, and went to take something. Jim sat on the bed once again, noticing for the first time how all the clothes were nowhere to be seeing on the floor, and were in their respective hangers instead. Then, his mother came back holding some things and put them on Jim's desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;First,&quot; his mother began, &quot;we are going to take off that tight corset. I'll bet is giving you a hard time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's uncomfortable, but I couldn't take it off last night... I ended up sleeping like this&quot; said Jim, and looked down at his long nails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, we'll take care of them later, dear, but first things first for now. How long do you can take off the boots?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About a minute or so, before the pain becomes unbearable... it happened once, when I didn't knew yet&quot; answered Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will do.&quot; said Jim's mother, and began to undo the knots in the back of the corset. After some struggling, they were untied and she let Jim took everything off. One by one, he left the garments on the floor, causing the makeup and the jewelry to disappear until another set of lingerie appeared on him. This time it was a white lace bra with a matching thong. Some silver hoops appeared on his ears, along several bracelets on his wrists while his nails turned light pink and pink gloss and blue eyeshadow were heavily applied over his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that, after this, it's clear that you were telling us the truth... for a moment I just hoped...&quot; began his mother, truly surprised by the speed of the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok, mom... It's just that... I feel completely helpless...&quot; muttered Jim, <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you tried to cover it up somehow?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but any clothes I try to wear end up changing too.&quot; answered Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about something like... a blanket? They are not clothes in the literal sense of the word, would they change too? You can't go just wearing underwear all the time&quot; she said, holding the sheets on Jim's bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, I didn't think of that, but I would like to give it a shot.&quot; said Jim, and picked one sheet, pulling it over his shoulders and closing it in the front, much like a robe, covering himself with it. For some moments, nothing happened, but this changed after a couple of seconds. The sheet divided in three. The upper part transformed into a strapless vinyl crop top, nothing more than just a mere band that covered his bra and not much else. The middle part changed into a pair of high waisted short shorts, tight on his waist and back. And the last part just keep tightening until they formed some white lace pantyhose.<br />
<br />
His mother raised a hand to her mouth in shock, &quot;I'm so sorry, Jim. I didn't think that will happen!&quot; she apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter... You were right, I can't go wearing just lingerie all the time, and the rest of the options aren't much better than this...&quot; he shrugged is shoulders, and reached down to pick up the boots he was wearing before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wear this instead. They will go easier on your feet, and... I think they match much better.&quot; she said, handing him a pair of white pumps from his open closet. Jim accepted them and waited until the pain was beginning to be noticeable before putting them on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just can't think about what you must be going through, dear, but there are some things I would like to try&quot; she said, and began to work. Jim knew nothing she could try would make any difference, but let she do it anyway, just to humor her. She unsuccessfully tried to take off the polish of Jim's nails, but it just didn't want to came off. Clipping down the nails was just as useless, as they grew back in just a couple of seconds. The makeup proved to be just as resistant, remaining as perfect as ever. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, mom. I didn't have much hope on anything of this working...&quot; said Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not going to give up so easy, dear. We are going to change you back, I promise you&quot; his mother assured him, and they just stayed there, hugging each other.</p>
