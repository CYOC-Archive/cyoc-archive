<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jonathan can be quite kinky, it&#39;s part of his nature. The power of shrinking or growing objects or persons has set his mind on fire, not really interested in evaluating the consequences. So, when he saw a very tall and muscular man walking along his street, he was not able to resist testing his power on him. <br />
<br />
&quot;WOW, he is such a stud, at least 6&#39;9&quot;, proud of his physic, a massive man wearing light blues and quite too tight jeans, and a white tank-top which were leaving very few for the imagination of how endowed and developed he is. <br />
<br />
Concentrating on that hunk, he said:  &quot;Shrink, shrink, shrink&quot;, well several times. To his most satisfaction, Jonathan saw the man shrinking with these clothes on, to around a doll size, so a little more than 12 inches tall. The toy-sized man was still dressed, but unable to budge very much during the shrinking process. Feeling dizzy, he had to put a knee down for a while. Standing up again, he was so confused to see that everything around became so huge, nearly 6 times bigger. <br />
<br />
Suddenly,  Jonathan remembered where he had seen him before. He appeared on TV after he had to testify in a court of law against a couple of lesbians. Those two women had a young teen boy a few years ago, but they were not able to provide the boy with a safe environment. In that insane unorthodox family, it was toxic and harmful to the teen&#39;s development. The man was is gym teacher or something.  Somehow, the man saved the boy&#39;s life. So, our powerful guy with the capacity to shrink others began to feel guilty.<br />
<br />
Strangely, that day, the muscle man was on his way to pay a visit to the teen we were talking about, but he had grown up since then. He was still living in a very nice foster family. Jonathan was still observing the now shrunken man. The tiny guy seemed to look at a house, Yip and he engaged himself toward it running as fast as he could. Then, near the front door, he stood still, waiting for something. Suddenly the door opened and an around 16-17-year-old teenage boy stepped outside.  The tiny man jumped up and down, waving his arms saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kevin, it&#39;s me, I shrunk, I need you to help me before some bad person sees me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy was quite good-looking, a very nice decent young man dressed in beige jogger pants and a red T-shirt. He had very short blond hair and blue eyes and he was obviously athletic. <br />
<br />
&quot;OMG, but how it happened, Mr. Zain?&quot;, asked the handsome young man<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea, honest, but hurry to help me, no one should see me like that!&quot;, the man replied.<br />
<br />
Squatting, the boy picked the man up with both hands, pressed him against his chest, then stood up and got back inside his house. So Jonathan was not able to see more, but he definitively noticed that the boy&#39;s crotch looked like a tiny tent... <br />
<br />
Kevin was very thankful for his life being saved by that man&#39;s help a few years before. It ended up that Mr. Zain was the boy&#39;s gym teacher back then. But what the man never knew, was what kind of feeling the teen has for him. He has been deprived of male presence and influence as he lived with misfit lesbian women who were his two moms.  The man was always ready to help anyone, in a very unselfish way. But misguided by his former bad environment, the boy didn&#39;t know how to interact with others, especially with men and in society in general... He has no role model at all. So Mr. Zain was some kind of mentor. He comforted the boy on many occasions, especially when his 2 moms were fist-fighting.  The poor boy was caught in the middle of violent fights on many occasions and even got hit and bruised. So Mr. Zain had no choice but to report the case to the child welfare.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a few years later, Kevin was holding his saviour in his hands.  He never told the man, but over the years, he developed some kind of strange fascination with that tall and strong man. He never knew how to deal with it though. But now, he was 6 times smaller, which made him feel very confused.<br />
<br />
As he was inside the house, the boy, maybe unconsciously, was pressing the toy-sized Mr. Zain a little too strongly against his chest while rubbing him up and down a few times. The man felt his genitals compressed and stimulated in a way he had not expected at all. But he said nothing at that point even if it made him quite uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Kevin was home alone that day, nevertheless, he went to his bedroom upstairs with the tiny man. It was the first time Mr. Zain ever saw the boy&#39;s room. When they met, it was always when the boy&#39;s foster parents were there, or they were just jogging together, and going to public places.  They had never ever stayed alone together before.  The teen sure wanted to help the tiny man, but his mind was so fuzzy, like being in some kind of dream where anything was allowed.  Putting the shrunken muscle man on his feet on his desk, he got an old dictionary he laid nearby for the man to be able to use as a seat.<br />
<br />
For a long awkward moment, they looked at each other, not saying a word. Then the boy, began a small talk, like asking the man how he became so muscular. He got his answers alright, so he learned about all those every single day gym sessions, discipline, a good diet with lots of proteins, etc.  Kevin asked tiny Mr. Zain if it was OK to feel his muscles. Finding no real reason to deny the request, he agreed. So the boy began to take the tiny arms between his thumbs and forefingers, pressing and rubbing the so well-developed biceps, quadriceps, and forearms too. His tank top was too tight, he was able to feel the awesome pectoral, and the abdominal muscles too. Even his back was very impressive. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see your muscled legs, OK Sir?&quot; The man nodded but thought the boy would wait he&#39;d pull down his tight jeans himself. But nope, the teen gently grabbed him, laid him on his back on the dictionary to then pulled off his tiny Snickers. Then he managed to unbuckle the tiny belt, then the waistband to pull on the jeans, removing them.  The man was only wearing his tank top, whiter compression bicker-type underwear and white socks. With a lot of enthusiasm, Kevin probed and felt the perfect legs quads, and calves. But without asking any more permission, he also pulled off the tiny tank top.  Sure, Mr. Zain found it unsettling, but like most bodybuilders, he loves having attention and admiration.  After all, Kevin was not a bad boy, just somebody without many social skills he should have acquired many years before, but boys without a dad.. what to expect?<br />
<br />
For some reason, the tiny man tolerated being grabbed, touched, probed, and almost taken like he was some kind of toy or pet. He would probably be more upset if it could have been somebody else but Kevin. Nevertheless, he was half naked, so very exposed. But it was not worse than those bodybuilder poses sessions at competitions he went to a few times before.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Mr. Zain had a little accident at a moment the boy was holding him in his right fist. It&#39;s not that he was holding him way too tight, but the pressure on his abdomen made him fart, but not only hot gas went out, a couple of turds decided to go out as well. The man blushed and worst, the teen felt the tiny bumps as well. Shameless, the boy having a very good idea of what it was, carried his tiny man to the bathroom. But besides not leaving him some privacy, he pulled off the tiny compression underwear soiled with shit right over the sink. Turning the water faucet on, he put Mr. Zain under the warm water stream, poured some cream soap, and washed the tiny butt carefully. <br />
<br />
Gee, almost naked except for his socks, the tiny man was confronted with the fact the boy really thought he was in charge of anything. While he was at it, Kevin washed him from foot to head, he finally even pulled off the tiny socks. After being rinsed, he was wrapped inside a tiny towel that was huge to him. <br />
<br />
Tiny Mr. Zain have no idea what the good looking  boy will do</p>
