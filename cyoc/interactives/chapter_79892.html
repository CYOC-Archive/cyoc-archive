<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She steadied herself using the bathroom counter.  She looked down at herself and also looked in the mirror. She was surprised by why her arms were getting so hairy, but also noticed it was happening to her legs too.  She was thinking maybe she just needs to shave, but she did that yesterday.  Next she noticed the hair was actually growing on her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this?!&quot;  she semi-yelled.<br />
<br />
Then she noticed a hair on her right breast.  She went to wipe it off, but it didn't move.  She went to pull at it as was surprised it was attached.  Soon, more hair appeared on her boobs and it looked like chesthair she would see on a sexy man.  She was turned on by hairy chests, but on sexy men not herself!  <br />
<br />
While noticing her hairy boobs, she also felt her formerly silky skin.  It felt like her skin was a little rougher and when she went to touch her fleshy boobs, they felt more like hard pectorals despite the fact they stuck out on her chest.  She brushed her nipples and was alarmed she didn't feel any sexual pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was hit with another wave and this one knocked her down to the ground.  She sat up against the counter and looked at her feet.  Her small, petite feet were now growing.  Her just pedicured toenails were losing their shine and the polish was fading.  Soon her feet looked to be about a man's size 13.  The transformation continued up her legs.  Susan tried to say something, but it seemed she was at a lost for words.<br />
<br />
Her shapely legs soon became more muscular to better match the hair that currently resided on them.  She grabbed the counter again and was able to stand up.  She was surprised now that her legs had apparently lengthened because according to the mirror it looked like she gained five inches in height.<br />
<br />
She looked down at her legs, now hairy and muscular and then felt a presence on her butt.  She grabbed it and felt it shrink in, along with her womanly hips.  Soon her bubble but and birthing hips were replaced with a rock-hard ass and skinny man-like hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm becoming a man?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as she said that, she felt a tingling sensation in her nether regions.  Her insides were changing as her ovaries stopped producing eggs and started producing sperm.  Her ovaries then moved through to her womb which was shrinking, turning into her new prostate.  Her ovaries then made their first appearance on the outside of her body, coming through some flabs of skin that was part of her vagina and starting to form a scrotum.  She now had a set of low hanging testicles as they started to grow hair like the rest of her body.  She watched in horror as the rest of her vagina continued to close up and her clitoris had expanded greatly.  Soon it was two inches outside her almost closed pussy and was continuing to grow.  Her vagina finally closed up for good as her clit became more penis-like and grew to around eight inches in length.  Even though she was scared, seeing a penis made her horny and the penis soon became hard.  She was experiencing her first boner.<br />
<br />
She was going to go touch it, but then looked at her dainty hand.  It was growing as well, with hair growing on her knuckles.  Her manicured nails shortened and the colors faded, just as her toes had done.  Her waist also grew out as her bellybutton pushed out and a six-pack formed.  The transformation went up to her shoulders, as they broadened out.  Then she watched as her tits started to suck in like her ass had done previously.  She tried to pull on them to prevent them from deflating, but it was no use.  Her nipples also shrank and soon she her tits were replaced with a nice set of abs.<br />
<br />
The transformation continued upward as she felt the urge to cough as an Adam's apples formed in her throat.  Soon those womanly moans were changing to manly sounding voice.  She looked in the mirror as her plumped lips started to lose their tone and became man like.  She noticed her upper lip was gaining a little bit of facial hair and noticed she now had a five o'clock shadow, which totally contrasted the rest of her feminine face, but that would change soon.<br />
<br />
Her checkbones and jaw became more angular as her little ears grew larger.  Her petite nose also grew.  Her formely huge feminine eyes, became to grow a little smaller and her eyebrows grew thicker.  Her hair remained long, but it was more shaggy like a man's than the silky smooth hair of a woman.<br />
<br />
The transformation was complete.  Susan looked herself (or himself?!) in the mirror once again.  What she (he?!) saw was what Susan would have wanted in a perfect man.  But it was HIMSELF!</p>
