<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was so engrossed in his books that he didn't hear Vinnie enter his room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to figure out how I changed you, Ryan?&quot; Vinnie asked as he read the cover on the book Ryan was <br />
reading.<br />
<br />
Ryan set the book down with a look of total surprise, &quot;How'd'ya get in here, Vinnie? Can you teleport too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; laughed Vinnie, &quot;I came by to see how you were doing after Carter told me you changed back.  Your <br />
brother Dylan let me in, and told me where your room was.  I guess you didn't hear me knock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Ryan said wiping his forehead, &quot;I don't think I can handle any more magic right now,&quot; Ryan lied.  He <br />
wanted to get up and get Vinnie out of his room, but as soon as he saw Vinnie he popped major wood. It wasn't <br />
tenting his boxer shorts.  It was at full staff sticking out of the fly, and his mushroom tip was smooshed <br />
against the underside of his desk drawer and oozing precum heavily. He started to sweat.  Why was Vinnie here?  <br />
Why was he so obsessed with Vinnie.  Damn, he needed Vinnie inside him right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nervous, I'll change you back into a dumb jock,&quot; Vinnie asked.<br />
<br />
Ryan decided to play possum.  He opened his mouth and shrank into his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn!&quot; exclaimed Vinnie, &quot;I didn't mean to- I still don't know how I? I must've.  I guess just saying it <br />
makes it happen.&quot;  He sighed and reached into Ryan's chair and pulled out his living jockstrap. He looked <br />
around to see if Dylan had seen it.  &quot;Well, I guess, I'll borrow your books, Ryan, and I suppose it would look <br />
weird if I carried a jockstrap out of your room. So, I'll have to wear you. Luckily, I cam commando.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan's eyes would have rolled and he would have laughed his ass off.  &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ryan thought, &quot;Vinnie <br />
came over here hoping he could change me back into a jockstrap.  Well, I'm glad I didn't disappoint him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie's cargo shorts were on the floor, and Ryan was over his ankles and secured around his waist. Then the <br />
cargo shorts were back in place and Vinnie was sitting on Ryan's boxers in Ryan's desk chair flipping through <br />
the books.  He selected only 3 of the dozen Ryan had borrowed from his grandmother, and loaded them into <br />
Ryan's backpack along with some clothes for Ryan in case he changed human again. Then he started to leave. He <br />
ran into Dylan as he was leaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how's it hanging?  Did my brother have what you needed?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, he did,&quot; Vinnie said, &quot;Loaned me a few books.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. You're different than his other friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Hearse and Carver are a couple of dumb jocks, and usually Ryan asks like one too. He thinks jocks are <br />
supposed to be dumb or play dumb.  He got a 710 on the math portion of the SAT, and nearly as good on the <br />
verbal, but his grades don't show that.<br />
<br />
&quot;He did?&quot; Vinnie said in true surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he did.  Say do you play chess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. Do you think your research could wait until later?  I enjoy working out and playing chess at the same <br />
time. I've got a gym and official chess clock and game set up in the basement.  Ryan used to play chess with  <br />
until he was about 14, then his buddies convinced him that chess was too nerdy for a jock. Why don't you join <br />
me for some mountain spring water and a chess match and workout in the basement, Vincent?&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
He had moved across the room and draped his arm buddy buddy across Vinnie's shoulders. He started guiding <br />
Vinnie to the basement stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, I- uh guess I could,&quot; Vinnie answered.<br />
<br />
No, thought Ryan, and he tightened around Vinnie's balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh,&quot; Vinnie said awkwardly as his cargo shorts tented.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries, man, I'm always throwing boners too. It's what young guys do.  I little exercise of the mind and <br />
body is just what you need. You're 18 right?  So you want anything stronger than water, we got a full wet bar <br />
down here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Vinnie blinked he was down in the ultimate man cave.  There was a billiards table in one corner.  An Icarian <br />
workout circuit and free weights in another corner and then there was the big flat screen HDTV, sofa and wet <br />
bar. &quot;That door over there is the sauna for when we're done.  Pops made us our own health club down here,&quot; <br />
Dylan explained, &quot;Here's the chess game already to go.  The way Ryan and me used to do it was we'd make a <br />
move, while the other lifted weights for 2 minutes until the clock chimed, then we'd switch places.  Makes for <br />
a more exciting game and workout. You game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm white,&quot; Vinnie announced, and gallantly moved the king's knight out on the board, then he hit the timer, <br />
and headed for the nearest weight machine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; said Dylan eagerly.<br />
<br />
Vinnie was surprised that Dylan was such a good player. The game went on and on, and both young men were <br />
drenched from lifting weights.  They had completed the Icarian circuit twice, and moved on to the free <br />
weights.  Half the pawns, two bishops and a knight sat on the table, as Dylan rubbed his chin, and moved his <br />
black queen to put Vinnie's King in check. Vinnie moved his remaining knight to block the check and threaten <br />
Dylan's rook. Dylan ran back to see Vinnie's move when he heard the chime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, you're a good player, Vin,&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
They were both panting from their workouts when they finally agreed they had stalemated each other.<br />
<br />
They laughed, and Dylan made Vinnie a tequila sunrise and then Dylan stripped down to his briefs, and asked, <br />
&quot;Ready for a sauna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that sounds great, but I don't have a suit or underwear - I'm wearing my jockstrap,&quot; Vinnie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine wear the jockstrap or go commando. It's just us guys,&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
He refilled Vinnie's drink, and the two adjourned into the sweltering sauna.   In a few minutes, Vinnie was on <br />
his belly getting a massage from Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a nice jockstrap, Vinnie. Do you think I could borrow it sometime?  I've got a rugby match tomorrow, <br />
but I need a jockstrap with a cup. Do you think you and Ryan could help me out?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
Vinnie moaned an &quot;Uh, huh.&quot; Then Vinnie's eyes went wide. Dylan knew about Ryan?  Ryan must've told him.</p>
