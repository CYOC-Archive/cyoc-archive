<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny looked at the giant baby stroller that was now parked in her driveway. The medal was white it went down to a bright pink seat for her that had cute little pictures of ponies dancing around on it. Still sucking her thumb she was awe struck by this. She realized that she was sucking her thumb and pulled it out of her mouth. With the absence of something in her mouth and not talking her mouth began to feel weird like something was really missing from it. Feeling a compulsion to put her thumb back in her mouth, trying to resist this urge the feeling began getting stronger and stronger. It was becoming a need to put her thumb in her mouth once more deciding that she needed to relieve herself of this weird feeling she put her thumb back in her mouth and the need started to subside. Not knowing what to do and knowing that she was a super hero that can’t talk right, needs to have something in her mouth,  can’t use the restroom and who knows what else is implied with wearing this outfit. She decided that it was not a good idea to be standing outside in her current outfit. so she ran inside her house knowing she would be safe here until her parents got home in like two hours.<br />
<br />
Wondering what she should do now that she is a super hero. Getting really sick of sucking on her thumb she decided that she better remedy her constant sucking problem first. Her only problem was that she did not want to leave the house wearing her current outfit she would be mocked and laughed at by anyone that saw her. She decided that she could change out of her outfit and go buy some binkies to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
She tried to pull off her striper boots but they would not budge, feeling slightly scared about this she tried to remove her mask but the same thing happened. She looked at the note kyle had left her. Jenny re-read all the instructions but there was nothing telling her that she could not take off the outfit when she wanted to she threw the note to the ground. As it fell down it flipped over and read the she must wear the costume until she fights two crimes. And so that she would not weasel out of wearing it she had to put it on three times a week. After reading this she knew why she could not take the outfit off and was now feeling ashamed that she had to go out in public like this. Thinking that kyle really thought of everything when he cursed her. Really needing a binky so she does not need to keep sucking her thumb as it was beginning to get wrinkly she decides to leave.<br />
<br />
Walking out to her stroller wondering why she was going to take this instead of walking she thought that less people would see her this way so she decides gets in. as soon as she sits down in the chair for her some straps come out of nowhere and buckle her in. a microphone comes out of the side of the stroller, she wonders how she is supposed to drive the stroller. Saying “aww I wanna get iss a wittle bwinky to suck on”. No sooner had she finished saying that did the microphone slide back in the side and the stroller started to move. At first it moved slowly like someone was pushing it then It really started to pick up speed moving what she assumed was around 100 mph taking really sharp turns that jerked jenny around finally stopping at a department store.<br />
<br />
The stroller let jenny go, she stood up and fell right down. She was really dizzy and could barely walk straight. Finally she made it to the door and was not so dizzy anymore. She walked in the store and resumed sucking her thumb as she looked around. It was massive and she did not know where to look for binky’s. As she was looking around a guy walked up to her and asked if she needed help finding something. Jenny looked at him and pulled her thumb out of her mouth and asked “ wawer woud I fwind bwinky?” the guy looked like he was about to laugh and pointed her to an isle saying they would be on isle 15. Jenny smiled at him with her thumb back in her mouth and walked off.<br />
<br />
Finally she found the binky’s then it dawned on her that she did not have any money to buy them with. Looking around she saw a young girl around jenny’s age looking for a set of binky’s herself jenny walked up to her and put on her cutes look she could muster and asked “ can wou hewp me buy a bwinky?” the girl looked at jenny and started to laugh at her. This really made jenny feel embarrassed to be there she felt like crying. The girl looked at jenny and said. I will buy you a binky if you beg me to buy you one. Just like a little baby.</p>
