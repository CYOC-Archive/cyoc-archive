<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait,&quot; said Gabby, &quot;before you go, I want to ask you something...&quot;<br />
<br />
 the black clad latex girl said, hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I found my way here, a few years ago, I did want to turn myself into latex,&quot; she started, &quot;but I wanted <br />
to go further, I just didn't have the courage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Lina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to be more than just a rubber girl,&quot; Gabby continued, &quot;I wanted to become a toy, a sex toy...I want <br />
to become a dildo, to be used in every naughty way and loved.&quot;  Gabby smiled hopefully.  &quot;I didn't have the <br />
courage to complete the transformation when I first found this place, so the wizard told me I could work in <br />
the shop until I found the right person or people to finish my change and take me home.  I believe that you <br />
two are the right ones to take me home.  Please, make me into your toy and take me home with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to become a sex toy?&quot; Lina asked, bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush,&quot; Amy chided, &quot;you're one to talk, Ms. Rubber Horse,&quot; she admonished with a grin.  Lina looked down <br />
sheepishly, oddly liking being commanded by her friend.<br />
<br />
Amy continued, &quot;What sort of toy do you want to become?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be a dildo, but I will be your toy, so really, anything you wish.&quot; Gabby said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; mused Amy, a cheshire grin slowly spreading across her face.  &quot;Okay,&quot; she said,  &quot;We'll make you our <br />
toy.&quot;  She had an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; beamed Gabby, &quot;Thank you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can we finish your transformation?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
Gabby led them further into the aisles in the back of the store, the toys and costumes becoming more and more <br />
outlandish the further they went.<br />
She led them to a machine that looked like one of those plastic injection molding machines that you see at the <br />
zoo, or the museum.  Next to it was a table, looking not unlike an operating table, only this one was concave <br />
on the surface and there was a tube connected to the drain at one end, the end closest to the machine.  The <br />
tube ran down into a sort of reservoir for a pump looking device, which then fed into the molding machine.  <br />
There was a collection of robotic arms above the bed as well, all folded up.<br />
<br />
&quot;This machine will finish my change to liquid latex,&quot; Gabby explained, &quot;and I will travel through the tubes <br />
into the molding machine, molding me into the shape you choose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby moved to the bed and climbed atop it to lay down.  Amy approached the injection molding machine, as she <br />
did, a screen on the front blinked to life.<br />
TOUCH TO START... the display read.<br />
<br />
Amy placed her paw on the screen, which blinked, and read INITIALIZING...<br />
<br />
Lina stepped up behind Amy, curious about the machine, when Amy shooed her away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go,&quot; she said, &quot;this is a surprise for both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy proceeded to cycle through the options on the computer screen in front of her, selecting this, tweaking <br />
that, adjusting dimensions.  She spent a few minutes designing something, then looked for the activation <br />
button.  &quot;Ready?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Gabby called to her from the table, &quot;Wait, before you start the process, I want to kiss you both one last <br />
time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina was already at the table, so she bent down into the arms of the rubbergirl, kissing her gently on the <br />
lips.  Their latex skin squeaked and creaked as they touched, Gabby running her hands up and down Lina's back.<br />
<br />
Amy moved over to the rubbergirl, and embraced her, kissing Gabby, open mouthed, tongues exploring each <br />
other's oral cavities.  When they broke the kiss, Amy looked into Gabby's eyes and asked, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby nodded, &quot;Thank you,&quot; came her reply.<br />
<br />
Amy moved back to the machine and touched the start button, then came back over to the bed to watch the <br />
process.<br />
<br />
First, the robot arms activated and a single arm with a hypodermic on the end swung down.  The cylinder of the <br />
needle was filled with a black substance that neither Amy nor Lina could identify.  It slowly approached <br />
Gabby, and a voice came from the machine, saying, &quot;Please hold still.&quot;  The arm aligned itself to Gabby's arm <br />
and proceeded to slowly move in, first dimpling the black latex skin of the girl, then piercing it.  There was <br />
a hiss, and the cylinder of black fluid began to empty.  The now empty syringe then retracted, out of Gabby's <br />
arm, and swung up and back into the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; moaned Gabby, &quot;it's warm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby proceeded to touch the spot on the arm where the machine injected her.  &quot;Ooh, it's spreading, i'm <br />
getting all warm and tingly&quot; she observed.  She ran her hand over her breast, moving the nipple in a slow <br />
circle.  The other hand slid across her belly and down over her navel, continuing further down to her hips and <br />
to her crotch.  She brought her knees up and slipped a finger inside her now warming slit.  She moaned again, <br />
playing with both breasts and nipples, slipping a finger in and out of her moistening folds.<br />
<br />
Amy and Lina watched as Gabby proceeded to pleasure herself, but soon noticed that the black fluid had started <br />
to leak from her nipples, and her pussy.  Gabby slipped another finger inside herself, increasing the pace of <br />
her masturbation, gasping in pleasure.  She began to drool now, the same black fluid oozing out of her mouth, <br />
vagina, nipples, and even a bit from her anus.  She was lying in a small puddle of it now, flowing down the <br />
drain tube and into the reservoir of the pump.  She slipped another two fingers in, moaning as her vagina <br />
stretched to accommodate.  The fluid began leaking from her ears and nose, and even from her eyes as she <br />
managed to fit her whole hand into her pussy.  Her motions reached a fever pitch, as a sheen appeared all over <br />
her skin.  The two girls heard a noise not unlike a water balloon sloshing with water coming from the latex <br />
girl, and she arched her back as she came, crying out in ecstasy.  No sooner had she come, then her skin <br />
split, up from her nethers all the way to her neck, like an overripe fruit.  Her skin liquified and the rush <br />
of fluid that was her body now flowed down to the pump tank.<br />
<br />
The pump turned on, sending the mass of liquid latex that had been Gabby into the molding machine.  The <br />
machine hummed to life, and with the hiss of air two mold halves moved together and the black latex filled <br />
them.  MOLDING... said the display, followed shortly by VULCANIZING... and finally, after several minutes, <br />
COMPLETE...<br />
<br />
A drawer slid out of the front of the machine, faint wisps of smoke rising from the newly molded toy.  There <br />
was Gabby, now a sleek black dildo, all knobby shaft, connected to a flared butt-plug on one side and a <br />
clitoral stimulator on the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's still warm,&quot; Amy said, picking it up.  Her eyes widened as she did so.  &quot;I can feel her!&quot; she exclaimed, <br />
&quot;I can feel how happy Gabby is right now, to be a toy. This is amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lina,&quot; Amy said, &quot;get back down on your hooves, I want to give you something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; exclaimed Lina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get down on your hooves, pony,&quot; Amy commanded, swatting her on the rump, the latex skin giving a satisfying <br />
slap.  It definitely was a turn-on dominating her friend like this.<br />
<br />
Lina did as she was told, startled and surprised, but deep down, she knew she liked being treated this way.  <br />
She bent over again, placing her fore-hooves on the bare floor.  She didn't know why, but she liked being <br />
commanded, ordered around, treated like an animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; cooed Amy, &quot;now close your eyes.&quot;  Lina did as she was instructed.  Amy stepped behind her and began <br />
to massage the mare-girl's outer lips with the knobby shaft of the sex toy.  Lina moaned from the contact.  <br />
Amy slowly pushed the shaft into her friend, stopping every so often to listen to her cries of pleasure.   Amy <br />
lined up the butt-plug with Lina's tailhole and gently pushed it in, Lina moaning louder this time, the flared <br />
bulb slipping in and keeping the toy in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Gabby,&quot; moaned Lina, &quot;I can feel her wriggling and squirming inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl,&quot; Amy said, &quot;just stay there, I'm not quite done yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy had been glancing around the back room of the shop ever since she and Lina had finished up their &quot;fun,&quot; <br />
and was starting to get turned on by the myriad of toys and accessories for changed individuals and those <br />
wishing to change themselves.  She had also noticed that around the only blank mannequin in the room, there <br />
were a few assortments of pony-play gear, harnesses and the like.<br />
<br />
Amy had stumbled on pictures of men and women in such outfits while searching for pony pictures on the <br />
internet.  Initially she was repulsed, but that slowly gave way to curiosity, then desire.  She thought about <br />
seeing Lina, in her new latex mare form, wearing such items, and she was only slightly surprised to feel a <br />
heat and tingling in her loins.<br />
<br />
Amy pulled a bridle with a rubber bit off the shelf and moved over to her friend.  She rubbed Lina's nose and <br />
chin, as Lina sighed from the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Open,&quot; she instructed, and Lina opened her mouth.  Amy slipped the bit into her friend's mouth, sliding it <br />
over her large tongue, back and behind the large white teeth.  She slipped the bridle up and over Lina's head, <br />
tightening the buckles and straps, locking it in place around the mare's head.  &quot;That's a good girl,&quot; Amy said <br />
as she tousled Lina's chocolate mane, &quot;you can open your eyes again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina could feel the bit in her mouth, pressing against the corners of her lips, and could feel the straps of <br />
the bridle against her head.  She looked down at her hands-now-hooves, and knew that she would never be able <br />
to remove the bridle and bit on her own.  She moaned into the bit, feeling it pressing down on her tongue, <br />
realizing it was preventing her from speaking as well.  She could feel the insides of her thighs getting slick <br />
with her fluids.<br />
<br />
Amy smiled at the mare-girl, smelling her arousal with her own new nose.  She crouched down and gently <br />
caressed Lina's cheek before leaning forward and kissing her again, deeply, her rough tongue probing Lina's <br />
rubbery lips and pushing past them, sliding, rasping across the girl's large tongue.  Amy stroked the mare's <br />
mane and rubbed around her ears, eliciting a sigh of pleasure from the girl.<br />
She pulled back from her friend, looking into the deep brown pools of her eyes, &quot;That's it,&quot; she said, &quot;you <br />
like this don't you?  You like being a pony.  You like being my pony.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina looked up into the slitted pupils of her friend's eyes, hesitating for just a moment, then nodding slowly <br />
in agreement.  She did like it.  She liked being a pony, being Amy's pony.  Amy's pony.  The thought floated <br />
through her mind, finally settling with the weight of realization.  She felt it, felt the rightness of it, how <br />
it filled her with warm feelings, feelings of belonging, feelings of loving and being loved.  Amy's pony.  <br />
Amy's.  &quot;I am her pony,&quot; Lina thought, &quot;Amy is my mistress, my owner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy continued to run her paws through Lina's mane, down her neck, and between her shoulder blades.  Lina <br />
sighed again into the bit in her mouth and arched her back in pleasure.  Amy kept stroking, further and <br />
further down Lina's back, stroking her rump and tail, causing Lina to make cute little noises into the bit she <br />
was wearing.  Then, Amy stopped.<br />
<br />
She could see Lina was very wet and very horny, her latex vulva and clitoris swollen and shiny, glistening <br />
with her juices.  Lina moaned again, Gabby still stimulating her, and Amy could hear the need in her muffled <br />
voice.<br />
<br />
Amy gently took Lina's chin in her hands and motioned for her to stand up, then turned around to pull a <br />
leather body harness off the nearby shelf.  She fastened the collar around Lina's neck, carefully arranging <br />
the straps down her back, around her breasts, fastening the harness around her waist, and running the strap <br />
through her legs.  She carefully threaded Lina's tail through a metal ring on the back of the harness and <br />
tightened the straps running under her crotch, locking Gabby inside her friend.<br />
Lina did not struggle or protest, she was lost in a haze of pleasure, as Gabby seemed to be able to feel when <br />
she was approaching climax and she would stop vibrating, keeping Lina on the edge of orgasm.<br />
<br />
Amy moved behind Lina and gently took one of her arms, fastening a leather cuff around her wrist and attaching <br />
it to the harness.  She then did the same with the other arm, pinning them behind Lina's back, and not <br />
allowing her any way to hide her breasts or crotch.<br />
She attached a lead to the bridle, and said, &quot;Come on, girl,&quot; leading Lina back through the backroom and into <br />
the front of the shop, stopping to pick up Lina's clothes and her own.  She dressed a little, putting on her <br />
uniform skirt, leaving it riding low to leave her tail free.  She buttoned up her shirt, and stuffed her <br />
shoes, and Lina's clothes in her bookbag.<br />
<br />
On their way up to the front of the store, Lina's new hooves clopping satisfactorily on the hardwood floor, <br />
Lina stopped, looking at one of the shelves.  Amy felt the tug on the lead, and turned, &quot;What is it?&quot; she <br />
asked.  Lina leaned over and picked something up with her mouth, then turned and clopped over, dropping a <br />
velvet collar into Amy's paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;For me?&quot; Amy asked.  The mare nodded.  &quot;Aww, that's sweet.  Thank you.&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
Amy opened the collar and placed it around her neck, and the pair of them continued up to the front of the <br />
shop.<br />
<br />
They came around one of the shelves to see the old man standing behind the counter, smiling at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;My,&quot; he said, &quot;it looks like you girls had some fun back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina blushed, but Amy just smiled, &quot;We did!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said the old man, smiling knowingly. &quot;I must say, I'm sad to see my employee go, but if she has found <br />
her home, I won't keep her.  The old man looked thoughtful for a moment, then said, &quot;you know, would you two <br />
like to work for me?  You can play with the wares in the store as much as you like...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy thought about it, then said &quot;Can we sleep on it and tell you tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; came the reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we owe you?&quot; Amy said.  The old man replied, a twinkle in his eye, &quot;Nothing, everything in my <br />
store is free of charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina looked shocked, and Amy just said &quot;R-really?&quot;  &quot;Yep,&quot; said the old man, &quot;oh, but before I forget, let me <br />
see your collars.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy and Lina stepped up to the counter and leaned over it.  The old man affixed some sort of black and red tag <br />
to each collar, some sort of pendant.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are these?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Incognito charms,&quot; replied the shopkeeper, &quot;They keep people from noticing your changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Handy,&quot; Amy said, turning to Lina and running a paw up her stomach and squeezing her breast.  Lina gave a <br />
little moan at the touch.  &quot;Thank you so much.&quot; Amy said.  &quot;My pleasure,&quot; replied the man.<br />
<br />
She began to walk toward the front door, but had to tug on the lead a bit before Lina would follow. Lina was <br />
afraid to go outside.  What if the charm didn't work, and worse yet, she was naked, and a horse-girl to boot!  <br />
But Amy kept walking and where Amy went, Lina followed.  They went out onto the street, the sun warming Lina's <br />
synthetic skin.  She could feel her cheeks getting warm, and she knew she must be blushing furiously.  She <br />
could hardly believe it, here she was, a latex horse-girl, as naked as the day she was born, in a bit and <br />
bridle, and a leather harness, with a living dildo in her pussy and up her ass, and no one seemed to care.  No <br />
one batted an eyelash at the two of them, the catgirl and the horsegirl, padding and clopping along on the <br />
sidewalk, seemingly without a care in the world.</p>
