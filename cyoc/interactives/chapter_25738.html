<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle found Simon right where Rachael had left him, in the science room. He was sitting on the floor with his back against a bench, eyes closed as if recovering form an ordeal. Hearing footsteps, the dazed senior opened his eyes and looked up at Kyle.<br />
“Where’d that bitch go? She’s gonna wish she’d never done that when I get through with her.” He mumbled. Shifting position a bit he winced and closed  his eyes again.<br />
“You animal! Do you have any idea what you’ve done to her? How could you even think of trying to rape someone?” Kyle was disgusted that the pile of filth sitting in front of him was respected by most of the school as a great athlete. To Kyle he was barely human.<br />
“She was practically asking for it, showing her huge tits off to the whole class like she did.” Simon didn’t sound as if he believed what he was saying, but to Kyle no excuse was ever going to be good enough. <br />
“You know, I was thinking about just having you arrested on attempted rape charges and maybe thrown in prison for a few years. Now I see you have absolutely no remorse and couldn’t care less what you’ve done to an innocent girl, I have something much nicer in store for you.” Kyle grinned evilly. “You’ve caused Rachael so much pain I think it’s about time you brought a little joy into her life.”<br />
“So what’re you gonna do, you little wimp?” Simon sneered. “It’s not like you can do any worse than jail.”<br />
“You’d be surprised. Transform or Dare?” Simon’s eyes snapped open and he struggled to get up. Kyle put one foot on Simon’s groin and pressed down very slightly and he fell still.<br />
“Okay, no answer means both.” Kyle said gleefully. “For your dare, you will say Transform or Dare back to me right away and dare me to finish off my curse by transforming you.”<br />
“Transform or dare?” Simon groaned.<br />
“Dare.”<br />
“I dare you to finish off your curse by transforming me.”<br />
“Okay then, for your transform, you will instantly become a bunch of three dozen red roses with beautiful perfume which, if planted in the ground, will grow into a huge rosebush with no thorns that will flower every year.” Kyle figured that ought to do it. Simon had been dealt with and he’d be much nicer now, especially without the capacity to hurt anyone ever again, not even by pricking them with thorns. The look on his face as he shrank and transformed into large bunch of sweet smelling roses went a little way to alleviating Kyle’s hatred for him, but not much.<br />
<br />
Rachael practically knocked him off his feet as she jumped on him when he came back to study hall. Her huge breasts squashed against his chest for a moment before she stepped back and checked him over anxiously.<br />
“You’re okay, you didn’t get hurt?” she asked.<br />
“I’m fine,” he replied, holding the flowers behind his back with one hand. “Simon’s gone and he’s not coming back.” He announced with a grin.<br />
“How?! What happened? Tell me.” She pleaded as she broke into a big smile, showing off her brilliant white teeth.<br />
“You messed him up pretty bad, he was still lying on the ground moaning when I got there. Still, he deserved every minute of pain.” Kyle said with venom. “Anyway, I threatened to call the police and told him what the penalty for attempted rape was. He and his family are moving to Canada tomorrow so I think that’s the last we’ll see of him.” Kyle couldn’t tell her what had really happened, but he had a suspicion that those roses would probably last the full duration of Kyle’s natural life; a long time for a rose.<br />
“Good riddance!” Rachael replied vehemently.<br />
“That’s not all though,” Kyle smiled. “Before he left, I made Simon pay for a little present I got you. It certainly doesn’t take the pain away, but I hope you like them.” He presented her with the roses and she beamed delightedly.<br />
“Oh, you didn’t have to…I love them!” she took a deep breath of their fragrance. “They smell heavenly, thank you!” she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. Kyle blushed bright red and said shyly.<br />
“It’s nothing…The lady I bought them from said if you plant them, they should grow into a big bush and you can have new roses every year.”<br />
“Thank you soooo much.” Rachael cooed. She pulled out a pair of scissors and cut the stem off one, then tucked it in her hair above her ear.<br />
“You look lovely.” Kyle said and she hugged him again, but this time he hugged her back. The bell went and he kissed her on the cheek as they broke apart. She touched the spot as if in disbelief and smiled.<br />
“I’ll see you later, okay?” he asked.<br />
“Not if I see you first.” She smiled. He grinned back and she gave him a little wave as he left the room. <br />
<br />
Rachael was in heaven for the rest of the day and she breezed through the rest of her classes without really paying attention. People kept staring at her, probably because her big breasts were stretching a very tight shirt and her Mom’s skirt did little to cover her long, tanned legs. She didn’t care though, she loved feeling pretty now, even though it had put her in danger, it had also brought her closer to Kyle. She couldn’t help thinking about him, every time she took a breath she smelled the perfume of the rose in her hair and it reminded her of him. She did get distracted once or twice though, when she shivered during class. When she took her seat in math, she sat down on something soft and immediately jumped up to see what it was. She spun around but only saw her long hair spinning with her, she had sat on the ends. It had grown longer, and seemed a bit thicker now too. She couldn’t keep it all behind her shoulders and it fell to mid thigh in shiny waves. She blushed when she saw everyone was looking to see what had made her jump up and kept a low profile for the rest of the period.<br />
<br />
Almost halfway through history class she shivered felt her breasts swell again, pressing against the taut fabric of Kyle’s shirt. Rachael quickly stood her textbook up on the desk in front of her and tried to look natural as her breasts pushed forwards behind the makeshift screen. She heard seams popping under her arms as the beleaguered shirt started to give way to her now FF cups. Luckily for her they stopped growing before the shirt snapped completely. A few of her classmates had heard the seams going and looked over at her curiously. Rachael glared at them and they turned back to their work. <br />
<br />
She didn’t see Kyle again that day but the big bunch of roses she carried home on the bus reminded her of him. She sat staring out the window, occasionally catching a look at her own reflection. Rachael could have sworn she was prettier than this morning. Her lashes were longer and thicker, her lips were fuller and poutier and her green eyes practically sparkled. It was almost her stop so she picked up her bag and held the roses in one hand as she stood up. She almost dropped them, however, when she shivered and her breasts surged against the already strained shirt. Holding the roses in front of her as she ran off the bus, people stared as more mass bounced with each step, but she was gone too quickly for them to be sure. Hair flying, she ran to the front door and hammered desperately on it. She just felt her fabric covered nipples brush the painted wood when her mother opened the door and she collapsed into the house. Rachael got to her feet and looked down at her chest just as her growing boobs gave one last spurt and her G cups snapped the seams all down both sides of Kyles now useless shirt and burst out into her Mom’s face.<br />
“Oh my, it seems you’ve grown again, dear. The medical shows on TV say that teenagers occasionally have sudden spurts.” She smiled at her daughter, “but I think you’re more beautiful than ever.” Her Mom did seem to be taking this pretty well, it’s not every day a girl busts out of her shirt in the living room. “Tell you what, if you grow any more then we’ll take you to the doctor and see if there’s anything to worry about. If not, then the boys will still walk over broken glass to date you.” That was what Rachael was worried about, well, except for one boy. Suddenly smiling at the thought, she found a vase for the roses and went up to her room. <br />
<br />
Rachael didn’t notice much as she did her homework, but she shivered a couple of times and noticed that by the end of the night her hair was thicker and now fell to her knees. She’d have to cut it soon, but in addition to that her waist had shrunk a bit, making her already outrageous hourglass figure even more pronounced. As she got ready for bed, Rachael pulled out her pyjamas and was amazed to find they fit her. The top was enormous but it still barely contained her huge bust and she had to breathe out a bit to get the last button closed. Despite this, it was surprisingly comfortable once she got it on. As she drifted off to sleep, Rachael wondered what else was going to happen to her. It seemed the only parts of her still changing were her hair, still getting longer and thicker, and her boobs, still getting bigger. The hair wasn’t so much of a problem, she could just cut it, but if her breasts got much bigger she wouldn’t be able to stand up straight. She hoped it would stop soon…</p>
