<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay had to properly try this body out. He decided to message Emma, his current girlfriend. Coincidentally, as he looked at his phone, he saw he had a missed notification, a message received 5 minutes ago from her. “Heyyy you free?” it read. He grinned. What perfect timing. Jay responded, telling her she could come over. There was an instant response from her. She said she’d come over right away.<br />
<br />
Jay had to prepare. The most pressing matter was his transformation. There was only a couple of minutes remaining until he’d revert back. He extended the duration to two hours. That should be more than enough for some fun with Emma. Then there was the issue of if Emma would be up to this or not, though Jay didn’t worry too much about that. She was absolutely infatuated with him, very eager to please and make him happy. Even with all the sleeping around he did, she didn’t mind, though Jay was unsure if she was turning a blind eye to it, or if she was just that gullible.<br />
<br />
Soon Jay heard a knock on his door. He threw on a simple shirt and shorts. The shirt hung a little loose due to his slightly narrower frame, deaccentuating his new chest. On the other hand, the shorts weren’t loose. They might be a little too tight, strained against his muscular butt and thighs which had received additional feminine padding. He did a little flex in the mirror, admiring himself. He was still immensely muscular. He still looked mostly like himself, now a little androgynous, but still retaining his sharp features. There’s no way she didn’t want this.<br />
<br />
He opened his door, revealing Emma, a slender brunette. She stood 5&#39;11&quot;, tall for a girl, though of course significantly shorter than her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” she lit up.<br />
<br />
“Hey Em.” he greeted back.<br />
<br />
She was all smiles. Somehow it seemed like she hadn’t noticed anything off about him just yet. She was never the most observant person, but this was a little much. Well, it’s not like he dated her for her wit. He eyed her juicy ass, then reached and gave it a little squeeze. Emma giggled. He led her inside.<br />
<br />
“Your hair is getting kinda long.” Emma commented.<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Jay laughed. “Do you think I should get a haircut?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm.” Her brows furrowed. “No. I think it suits you.” She paused, meticulously studying his face. “It just really makes you look different. Not in a bad way I think.”<br />
<br />
Jay decided he might as well tell her right away. Rip the band-aid off.<br />
<br />
“There’s something I have to show you. You just have to know that it’s temporary, and that I can change back any time.”<br />
<br />
“Okay?” Emma replied slightly puzzled.<br />
<br />
Jay pulled his shirt off, revealing his muscular torso, also revealing some undeniably feminine characteristics, most notably a feminine pair of breasts instead of his normally hard pecs. Emma took in his body for almost half a minute before she staggered back in astonishment.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck? Boobs? How? Are you on drugs?”<br />
<br />
“No. Drugs can’t do this overnight.” he explained. “You see, I have a device. It&#39;s what I used to change myself.”<br />
<br />
“What? Can you show me?” she asked in awe, instantly convinced.<br />
<br />
“Later. I want to give this body a proper test drive first.” he replied.<br />
<br />
Jay grabbed a good hold of Emma’s waist. She was a little hesitant, but still following along. He leaned down for a kiss. She reciprocated and grabbed him. Still, holding each other, They slowly shuffled along to the couch where they then paused the kiss.<br />
<br />
“Your lips. They’re soft.” she noted. Her voice was soft and her breath already was heavy. So far, it didn&#39;t seem like she disliked this.<br />
<br />
Jay lowered her tight body down on the couch.He laid next to her. He began to touch and fondle her. Her body felt nice, though Jay wanted to properly take advantage of his changed body. He grabbed her arm and placed it on his chest. Emma took the hint. She hesitantly began to squeeze his chest. Fuck, it felt good. It was even better when another person did it<br />
<br />
They continued feeling each other up, Emma slowly taking more and more initiative. Half undressed, skin against skin, it all felt so sensual, his softer skin. Emma grabbed his muscular ass, feeling it up. She tugged at his underwear. What she wanted was obvious. The timing was perfect. Jay felt like he was already about to burst. They did a quick reposition, letting him enter her, and he did. He stuck his dick in. Slightly reduced, but still large, absolutely filling her and some more.<br />
<br />
They moved in a slow and steady rhythm, front facing front. Her hands on his ass, assisting his motions. They were both pretty much there. Soon, it happened. Both of them began to shake. Amazing. Jay felt it throughout his entire body. <br />
<br />
“Yes!” Emma screamed out.<br />
<br />
Slowly it waned. Jay panted. Emma’s also breathing heavily. Some silence They both laid and recovered. Jay was thinking about how widespread and how long the orgasm had been. He wasn’t disappointed at all. Also, he’d enjoyed having his new skin being touched. Maybe another time, he could tell her to use her mouth and nibble. After a while, Emma spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I don’t believe you.” Emma giggled.  “Something like this happens and you just want to fuck.”<br />
<br />
“So?” Jay laughed. He gave her asscheek a little squeeze. “Anyways, it seemed like you enjoyed yourself.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” She admitted. “But, that’s not the point! Explain please! You said you had a device?.”<br />
<br />
“Well.” Jay gave some consideration towards what he should say next.<br />
<br />
He could tell her about the Chronivac, but should he? He’d barely touched the surface of what it could do, but it seemed immensely powerful. Sharing it with anyone was risky. On the other hand, sharing it would open possibilities. He looked at Emma. She was looking at him expectantly. How much risk could she pose? He knew Emma, and she was about as harmless as she was hot.</p>
