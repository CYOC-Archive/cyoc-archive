<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abby walked into her room with a frustrated expression. She and her friends were playing DnD downstairs in the living room when her friend lost her prismatic D20 inside their couch cushions. It hadn&#39;t been the first time, but this time, it was really hard to find. She knew she could use her friend Diane&#39;s extra dice, but she opted to select an old one she kept around. It had been the one she found in the bathroom, definitely hers, as it bore several marks akin to hers. Her older sister had avoided her question earlier in the week about where it was, and Abby suspected Jen of messing with her on purpose. Come to think of it, Jennifer had not been seen all day. Maybe she had bounced over to her friend&#39;s house to hang out or just gone partying with others. Either way, Abby knew Jen had something to do with it.<br />
Abby frantically searched the room, hearing her friends calling up to her as she looked. She remained quiet save for her actions. She flipped her blanket off the bed, scoured her desk drawers, and even checked the bathroom in case she had forgotten. It had a strange smell, something familiar, but she found no dice there.<br />
She returns and takes note of her closet. She had worn a warmer jacket that day and often left stuff in the coat pockets without realizing it. Maybe she left them in it? Cautiously, she approached the doors and placed her hand on the doorknob. Before she could open it, one of her friends appeared in the doorway. It was Nora, who startled her.<br />
&quot;Hey, what you doing, Abby?&quot; she questioned. <br />
&quot;Sorry, Nora. I&#39;m trying to find that damn die I left up here. Can you help me find it?&quot; Abby looked back to the closet door.<br />
&quot;You mean this one?&quot; Without hesitation, Nora pulled the die from beneath the bed. &quot;Dude, every time, sixty percent of the time, it will be under the bed. Dead serious.&quot; She plopped the die in Abby&#39;s open hand, before making her way back downstairs. Abby rolled her eyes and followed her back to the living room.<br />
Jennifer, meanwhile, had nearly soiled herself when her sister got close to her hiding place. If there was one thing to be taken from the day, it&#39;s that Jennifer is lucky when it comes to hiding spots. Though she had hidden twice that day from her own sister. Either by pure coincidence or some other force watching out for her, neither time had she been found. Unfortunately, what Jennifer needed was the die. And now Abby had it again.<br />
Without much choice, Jennifer exited the closet space. She peeked the corner of the bedroom door, her figure bending over to accommodate her height. No one could be seen, but she could hear the girls starting the game up again. Quietly as she could, Jen scooted her humantaur body to the banister. She overlooked the group, who were reorganizing themselves for the next event. Abby was on the couch next to Diana while Nora sat on the Ottoman. Their other friend, Annabeth, sat in their mom&#39;s reading chair. The group of four settled in, while Jennifer watched in silence from above. <br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; began Abby, &quot;returning to the land of Ardrella, our heroines&#39; quest for the lost weapons of the gods, the Sickle of the Harbinger and its sibling, the cursed Eye of Sugnam, is underway. So far, our heroes have encountered the three-eyed trolls, a succubus with too many tentacles, and a mob of angry gnomes. Currently, the team is moving East to the wilds of Tanmoora, home to the infamous Stellan Warriors. All who approach rarely live long enough to leave the lands, and only one has come back... in a cage of bone!&quot; She does dramatic sound effects for the game with her phone, and the other girls try to remain impressed by her dramatization. &quot;Now, approaching the edge of the forest, Dan Prana Urd, the human Monk (Annabeth&#39;s character) and leader of the party, the lowly orc bard Hera (Nora&#39;s character) and their halfling warlock Astrid Feldspar (Diana&#39;s character), brace for whatever lies ahead.&quot;<br />
Abby moves a figure onto the board. The figurine is an Amazonian woman with four breasts and arms. Jennifer went wide-eyed, realizing both how weirdly linked to her that figure was as well as that Abby&#39;s game was most definitely not PG. &quot;Suddenly, a figure leaps out at the group. It&#39;s one of the fabled Stellan Warriors. In her upper arms, she holds a large mace, while her lower arms wield a pair of clawed gauntlets. Her attack is doubled from the usual Amazonian warriors, making her a tough foe, and-&quot; Abby suddenly stopped to address something, &quot;Yes, Nora. She has four tits. Woop-dee-doo.&quot;<br />
Nora, who was eyeing up the figure, popped her attention back to her Dungeon Master. &quot;Oh shit, sorry. I can&#39;t help I really like boobs. They... enthrall me.&quot; The other girls chuckled a little, their openly gay friend blushing.<br />
&quot;Well, stop it. I know you don&#39;t have any yourself, but save your envy for later. You can have her after the session is over if you&#39;d like, as I don&#39;t really need her again, and you seem very fond of her.&quot; Abby shook her head before returning to the dialogue. This time, reading it in a deep female voice. &quot;Hey, you lot are not welcome here. This land is a sacred place, home to some of the last of my people. I will do what I must to protect it from you interlopers!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh shit, what do I do?&quot; asked Nora hastily.<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;d say roll for Advantage.&quot; Diana motioned to the die. The die that transforms Jennifer. To say Jen&#39;s eyes bulged out of her head was an understatement. The die was in play now and only spelled trouble.<br />
&quot;Hey, wait. Abby, doesn&#39;t Nora, besides regular Advantage, also have that ability to add a third die?&quot; asked Annabeth.<br />
&quot;Yes, she has the Scroll of Tricella. Which I almost wish I HADN&#39;T included in this game and grants an additional Advantage roll.&quot; Abby looked over at the single die in Nora&#39;s possession. &quot;You know what, I don&#39;t want to dig for that die again, so screw it. Roll that die three times, and Diana will keep track of the numbers and bonuses.&quot; Diana sighed but agreed to track.<br />
Now Jennifer was panicking. That die was about to be rolled three times. Which meant a possible catastrophe waiting to happen. She quickly browsed her options. Should she risk being seen to stop the onslaught of transformations or stay hidden while it happened? Or something else?</p>
