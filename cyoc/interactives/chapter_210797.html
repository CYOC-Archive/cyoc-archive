<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What if I became your udder?” Ema suggested. Jeff looked at her for a moment, contemplating.<br />
“Hmmm, that could be interesting, but I’m not a cow, or female for that matter.” Jeff said. He looked at the computer again. <br />
“Yeah, but we could easily change that. If it really came down to it, we can change those things too, right?” Ema asked. She still thought it would be fun to try something like this.<br />
“Oh, I’ve got it!” Jeff said as he started typing into the program. He wanted what Ema wanted, he did ask for her opinion after all. He busied himself in the computer for a few minutes as he typed away and clicked at various windows.<br />
“What are you doing?” Ema asked as she watched Jeff at work. It had already been five minutes and he was still typing away.<br />
“The program can change anything, so why not transform us and do a bit of a reality shift at the same time? I figured there probably would be some way to make it work.” Jeff said as he finished up with most of the settings. <br />
“Oh! So how will it work?” Ema asked. She wondered what kind of Idea Jeff was able to come up with. She was excited about the possibility though.<br />
“So you want to become my udder, right? Well I’m not a cow, or even female. But with the program, I can set it to turn me into both while you turn into my udder. I’ll become an anthropomorphic cow, and the settings allow for nobody to remember anything different except for us.” Jeff said. He was starting to get excited, both mentally, and down there. <br />
“I think that could work! I’m really curious to know what being an udder will feel like.” Ema said. She smiled as she stood up.<br />
“The last bit, is how long do we want the transformation to be for?” Jeff asked, as he only had that to input.<br />
“Well, I don’t want it to be short. Hmm, how about 1 year, and after that time, we can decide whether we want it to go longer or not.” Ema suggested. It seemed like a good plan, so Jeff just nodded as he input the time.<br />
“Well then, you ready for this?” Jeff asked as he hovered the mouse over the submit button. He looked to Ema who just nodded. Jeff hit the button, thus starting the transformation.<br />
“So how long is this going to take?” Ema asked as Jeff turned from the computer. He looked up at her.<br />
“The transformation itself will take 24 hours. Luckily I’m home alone for the holiday week, so we can really enjoy the rest of the day.” Jeff said as he stood up from the chair. <br />
“So what do we do now?” Ema asked. She moved closer to Jeff. <br />
“Well, any moment now and-“ Jeff said when he suddenly felt and urge to remove his pants. He did so quickly, Ema just watching surprised.<br />
“What are you doing?” Ema asked, rooted in place.<br />
“I can’t control it, I bet that we are about to start fusing.” Jeff said as he moved closer to Ema.<br />
“Oh, oh!” Ema said as Jeff approached her and moved behind. She suddenly felt Jeff’s pelvis on her body, and she could also feel his erect member. She tried to move away, but she couldn’t seem to figure out how to do it.<br />
Jeff stood there as he could feel Ema starting to fuse to his pelvis. It was an odd sensation, as he knew she would eventually become a part of him. <br />
“Oh wow, this is weird.” Ema said as she felt along the place where they were fused. Her butt had ended up fusing with Jeff’s pelvis. <br />
“A bit yeah.” Jeff said as he blushed. He didn’t know what to do, as the transformation had just started. <br />
“So what do we do now?” Ema asked turning to Jeff. It was a bit harder for her to turn since she was fused to Jeff now.<br />
“What do you want to do?” Jeff asked as he looked around. <br />
“Want to watch some tv?” Ema suggested. She wasn’t sure what to do, or if she would even still be able to see and think when she was an udder. <br />
“Sure, let’s head downstairs.” Jeff said. They made their way down, coordinating their steps. They made it to the couch. After a minute of trying to figure out how to sit down, they opted for Jeff to just lie down, and Ema would do the same on top of him. <br />
They decided to watch a movie. Neither could figure out what to watch, but they decided upon a cheesy romance movie. Jeff figured that when he was female, he may be more into that kind of stuff anyway.<br />
Jeff and Ema watched the movie. During the span of the two hour long film, Jeff could feel as his penis started to shrink inward. He would’ve made a big deal of it, if not for his girlfriend laying on top of him. All he could do was mentally feel his body as it slowly turned female. Eventually, he felt as his groin flattened, and his reproductive system became that of a female.<br />
While the movie was playing, Ema also was changing. She didn’t realize at first, but she had gotten significantly shorter. Her arms and legs also shortened in length. She tried to move a few times, but realized she couldn’t do as such, as more of her back had fused with Jeff. She did notice that Jeff had become female, however. <br />
The movie finished, and two of the 24 hours had passed. Jeff stretched and paused the credits. He had had quite a bit to drink and needed to use the restroom.<br />
“I guess the device really worked, huh?” Ema said as she noticed Jeff starting to get up. She twisted her body to make it a bit easier on him. <br />
“Yeah, you seem to be turning into your role quite well.” Jeff said as he went to stand up. He held onto Ema, as she was still a bit heavy, and he didn’t want her falling off of him. Jeff also noticed that he could feel through Ema as he held her. Nerve endings must have grown through his body, and grown into her. <br />
“Well, you aren’t really a boy anymore.” Ema said as she felt Jeff carry her. He made his way to the bathroom, and sat down, Ema on his lap.<br />
“Yeah, I guess you’re right.” Jeff said as she started going. It was an odd feeling, peeing through a vagina rather than a penis. She figured that she would get used to it. Eventually she stopped, and cleaned up a bit. <br />
“So what do you want to do now?” Ema asked. She was somewhat helpless at this point. All she could do was wait until the transformation was completed.<br />
“Well, it is pretty late, so I was thinking about going to bed.” Jeff said as she stood up. <br />
“Sounds good, I’m getting tired too.” Ema said. Jeff then made her way up to the bedroom, and laud down to sleep. It didn’t take her or Ema long until they were both fast asleep.<br />
Jeff woke up, feeling refreshed. She kept her eyes closed as she sat in bed. She remembered about what had happened the previous night. She wondered how much more had changed. <br />
Jeff opened her eyes and let her eyes adjust. She then looked down upon her body. She noticed one thing right away, and that was the brown fur covering her body. She figured that she wanted to be a basic brown cow, but that it would probably be pretty cute. She also noticed that her feet had become hooves. Aside from that, she looked down at Ema.<br />
Ema had also been transforming, and was still asleep at this point. By this point, her body had turned pink, and it had mostly reshaped into the large sac on Jeff’s body. Her legs had also turned into udders. <br />
Jeff reached a hand down to feel Ema. It was sensitive to the touch, especially her udders. Who knew that being a girl could feel so good?<br />
Ema awoke due to the touching. She tried to stretch, but realized she had lost all bodily functions. She tried to speak, and was surprised when she could.<br />
“Good morning Jeff!” Ema said as she sat there helplessly on top of Jeff’s body. <br />
“Good morning beautiful!” Jeff said as she sat up in bed. She checked the time. They had been asleep since 10 pm the previous night, and it was already 10 am. 14 hours had passed. <br />
“What do you want to do today?” Ema asked. She couldn’t really do much other than just sit there. <br />
“Well, I was thinking breakfast, then a shower.” Jeff said as she stood up. Instead of having to hold Ema this time, Jeff noticed he could just let her hang there. <br />
“Sounds good, although I’m not too hungry.” Ema said. The jerking motion was making her rather sensitive. She suddenly felt something leaking from the udders that used to be her legs. <br />
“Oh, guess you- I’m leaking milk.” Jeff said as she went down the stairs.<br />
“Oh that feels so good!“ Ema moaned as the milk kept leaking. It felt rather odd, but the sensations were so pleasurable. Ema knew that if she was milked every day, this wouldn’t be such a bad year.<br />
Jeff made her way down to the kitchen, and grabbed a bowl. She poured some cereal. Before getting to the fridge, she realized something. <br />
“Oh, I have a source of milk right here!” Jeff said as she lifted Ema up. Ema looked confused at first. She saw the bowl of cereal, then realized what Jeff was doing.<br />
“Oh, good idea!” Ema said as Jeff started milking herself. Although Ema was feeling a lot of pleasure, Jeff was also feeling it as well. It felt good to be milked. <br />
After milking herself, Jeff sat down to eat the cereal. Despite the fact that it came from herself, Jeff thought it tasted better than usual. She ate at a decent pace, and finished her cereal. <br />
Jeff then cleaned up her dishes, and made her way upstairs to take a shower. She wasn’t wearing anything currently, but she did have a light layer of fur. She turned on the shower and stepped in.<br />
Taking a shower with hooves and fur was interesting. Jeff almost slipped a few times, but was able to eventually understand her footing. The warm water on her fur also felt rather nice. Jeff could also feel something else change as she was in the shower. <br />
As Jeff showered, she could feel her mouth and nose push out from her face. Her nose became large and leathery, her mouth eventually widened to fit her new nose. Jeff inhaled a large breath. She ran her tongue along her teeth as she could feel that they changed to match that of an herbivore. The fur grew to cover her face.<br />
Jeff smiled and looked down. Ema hadn’t said anything in a while, and looked to just be sitting there contemplating things. <br />
“Having fun down there?” Jeff asked as she stepped put of the shower and started to dry off.<br />
“Oh, yeah, there’s not much I can do right now, So I’ll have plenty of time to think.” Ema replied. She could feel the warm water running over her skin. She soon wouldn’t have to worry about anything for a while.<br />
“Well, I know that this is weird for both of us. Becoming a cow girl is definitely odd.” Jeff said as she dried off most of her fur. She decided to let herself air dry. Jeff made her way back to her computer and checked the progress bar. Roughly 16 hours had passed. <br />
“How much longer until it’s done?” Ema asked. <br />
“Not too long, just a few more hours.” Jeff said as she went and sat down on the bed. She laid down and scrolled on her phone for a few while drying off. After a few minutes, Jeff felt dry enough.<br />
Jeff the. Decided to get dressed. She opened her dresser to see that her clothes had shifted to accommodate a female rather than a male. She got dressed, wearing panties and other female garments. The one thing she was worried about was Ema, but luckily the jeans and shirt didn’t cover Ema too much. Jeff went and looked in a mirror. She was almost a full cow girl, but she felt rather cute. <br />
“You look great!” Ema said, complimenting Jeff. Jeff blushed through her fur. <br />
“Thanks!” Jeff said as she realized her voice got much higher, becoming much more womanly. Jeff giggled a bit and went downstairs. Ema bouncing as she went down. <br />
“So what are you gonna do now?” Ema asked. <br />
“I was thinking about going for a walk!” Jeff said. She made her way to the door and put on a coat. She opened the door and stepped outside into the cool fall air. It felt nice on her muzzle, and in Ema.<br />
Jeff started her walk. There were a few people waking by, but nobody paid Jeff any attention. That reality change was a good idea on her part. <br />
As Jeff walked, she felt as her spine pushed out from behind her. Her tail grew in rather quickly. Jeff turned to see a long brown tail with a cute tuft of fur on the tip. It felt odd, she could feel her tail as a new muscle. Either way, it was a cute look on her.<br />
As Jeff walked, she found her way around town. Eventually, she found her way into a little coffee shop. As she entered, she found a cozy little shop. There was a barista behind the counter. Jeff approached.<br />
“Hi can I get you anything?” The barista asked as Jeff approached. <br />
“Oh, hi, is there anything you would recommend?” Jeff asked as she walked up to the counter. <br />
“Well, I got a nice blend that would go well with some fresh milk.” The barista suggested. Jeff nodded and paid for the coffee. Jeff went and sat down at one of the tables. She looked put the window at the orange trees, a light wind rustled through.<br />
A few minutes later, the barista stopped by. She brought the coffee over. <br />
“So I never got your name?” The barista asked as she set the coffee down. <br />
Jeff was surprised, she hadn’t thought of a name. However, she had to act quickly. <br />
“Call me Jen!” Jen said as she stood up. <br />
“Well Jen! This coffee would go real well with some fresh milk.” The barista said. “Actually, I’m kind of curious to try it myself.” <br />
“Oh, sure!” Jen said as she stood up. “You good with this Ema?” Jen asked as the barista went back behind the counter to prepare another cup of coffee. <br />
“Yep! All my limbs have become udders now.” Ema said as she hung there. Jen was surprised she could still talk, but her head hadn’t fully transformed yet.<br />
“Great!” Jen said as she grabbed one of her udders. She squeezed a bit of milk into her cup. After she had enough there, she stirred it in. The barista arrived as well, and Jen happily put some fresh milk into the coffee.<br />
Jen took a sip of the coffee, and realized how good it tasted. The fresh milk added a nice touch to the otherwise bitter coffee. The barista thought the same.<br />
“Wow, this tastes really good!” The barista said. “Oh, I forgot to introduce myself, I’m Kara!” <br />
“Thanks! I haven’t ever been asked to provide milk for anyone before!” Jen said as she continued drinking her coffee.<br />
“Really? Well it was really good, maybe you should get a job here, we could use some good coffee!” Kara said. <br />
“I’ll think about it!” Jen said. She and the Kara talked for a bit, and Jen eventually left. <br />
Jen made her way back home, enjoying the walk. The golden leaves crunched beneath her hooves. As she walked, she felt her ears stretch into large animalistic ears. Her hair grew out a bit longer, and two small horns grew atop her head. To most, Jen looked like a full cow girl. <br />
Jen made it home and walked through the door. She checked the time and realized she had been out for a few hours. It was about 4pm, meaning 20 hours had passed out of 24. <br />
“Well that was fun, did you enjoy the walk Ema?” Jen asked to her udder. She waited a few seconds and there wasn’t a response.<br />
“Oh, have you lost ability to talk?” Hen asked, and again there was no response. Jen smiled as she pat her udder. Ema had almost fully transformed.<br />
From Ema’s perspective, she lost all ability to talk or move. Her body and organs had become that of Jen’s udders. Even though she couldn’t move, it was nice being able to just sit there. Each time Jen milked her also felt amazing. Maybe this next year wouldn’t be so bad. She no longer had to worry about eating or drinking. She figured that as she could also still see, at least this wouldn’t be boring.<br />
Jen went and used the restroom, then went to find out what to do for the remainder of the transformation. The house was empty, so Jen thought of what she could do. <br />
She couldn’t think of much to do, so she decided to eat a quick dinner. As she sat, her udders began to get a bit sore. It seemed as if she would need to milk herself often to make sure it didn’t swell too much. <br />
Jen decided to bake a cake using some fresh milk. She went through and found a good recipe, and made the batter. Milking herself felt great, and it would help the cake to taste great as well. Jen put the cake in the oven. It would be done around the time the transformation was fully completed.<br />
Jen decided to sit down and watch some tv. She found a cheesy show and watched it for a few hours. As she watched, her hands slowly changed to become more hoof like, but they remained as versatile as normal hands did. Her chest also pushed out a little forming small breasts. Her fur coat also finished growing in.<br />
The cake was done, and so was Jen and Ema’s transformation! Jen patted her udder, knowing that Ema was there. Jen smiled, she was a full anthropomorphic cow. <br />
Ema sat there motionless. Despite this, she felt happy about her new position. She would be there to provide for people who needed it. The next year may get boring, but it should also be fun!<br />
Jen smiled as she ate a slice of cake that she made. She wondered what to do next.</p>
