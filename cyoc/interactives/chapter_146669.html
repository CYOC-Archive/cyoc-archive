<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So, Ty decided to walk around the athletic area of the high school when he came across the swimming pool. Once there, he heard the coach shouting instructions at several tall, muscular boys who were swimming laps in the pool. They had just completed a circuit when they climbed out of the pool in order to take a break when a group of girls surrounded the athletes. They were Cindy, Sandy, Mary and June Alex. <br />
<br />
Ty was standing right there, so he stepped a little closer to he could hear the conversations which were going on. <br />
<br />
“Wow, the guys on the swim team are so HOT!” one girl swooned. <br />
<br />
“I wish I could have one of them as my boyfriend!” another one uttered out loud. <br />
<br />
“I just love their tall bodies and their huge muscles!” a third smiled. <br />
<br />
One girl was rather quiet. She just stood there in silence, admiring the amazingly athletic physiques of the male swimmers. She looked rather sad and a little envious at the same time. Ty suddenly caught on to what she was thinking. <br />
<br />
“All those guys are so lucky. They’re big, tall and muscular and they can get any girl they want. Here I am and I’m forever lonely…” she sighed sadly. “Nobody would ever want to be a fan of me….”<br />
<br />
The girl was wearing a Cheerleading uniform with the school’s logo on it. However, she was rather short, and she was a little bit on the pudgy side. Surely, none of the tall, handsome young men on the swim team would ever be interested in her. However, she just loved the attention the swimmers were getting. <br />
<br />
Ty quickly learned, thanks to his powers, that her name was Alexandria, but everybody called her Alex. She was just about 5 feet tall and she had long, brown hair with blue eyes. She was a loner, and nobody really looked after her too much. He saw how she envied the swimmers for all the attention they were getting from the girls and he felt sorry for Alex. <br />
<br />
“So, she likes attention? How about I just transform Alex into another member of the boys’ swim team? That should solve her problem!” Ty thought to himself. “She’ll get the same attention as all the other swimmers are getting now!” <br />
<br />
So, Ty quietly willed for Alex’s bladder to fill up, forcing her to run to the girl’s locker room. She ran to the locker room quick, feeling a sudden urge to pee, which came out of nowhere. As she sat down in the stall, she was overcome by an odd, intense tingling sensation, which ran across her entire body. She was unable to move at all since it felt like she was overcome by cramps. <br />
<br />
“Ohhhhh….” She moaned softly as her body started to change. <br />
<br />
Alex suddenly realized that her body was changing. Her breasts were rapidly shrinking into her chest, leaving her flat chested. Next, her vagina closed while something changed inside of her. Something appeared on her groin. It started out as a small stub which grew longer and longer, until it was 9 inches long. She barely noticed that she now had a penis along with testicles, making her a boy!<br />
<br />
That wasn’t all that changed. Her short, pudgy legs grew more than a foot longer, gaining length and muscle at the same time. She gained lots more muscle in her quads and in her calves, as she rapidly gained more than a foot in height. Her short, compact torso expanded by her flat chest bulging with mighty pectorals matched up with thick rows and columns of well-defined abdominal muscles. As her torso grew another 6 inches longer, she gained more in length, adding to her height. Finally, her arms suddenly bulged with thick, rock-hard biceps and triceps as they lengthened by another 5 inches, great for a swimmer who needed long arm in order to complete his mighty strokes in the water. <br />
<br />
Her Cheerleading uniform quickly morphed into nothing more than a black Speedo, which covered her groin. She also gained a swim cap over her short, brown hair along with a pair of swim goggles. <br />
<br />
“Uhhh…. What is happening to me?” she moaned in her deep, baritone voice. Alexandria, or rather, Alexander, stood up, almost losing his balance since he had to adjust to his 6-foot-8-inch towering height. As he walked out of the stall, he saw his reflection in the mirror on the wall. <br />
<br />
“WHOAAA!” he gasped out loud, as he saw how big and how tall he had become. “I’M A GUY! Holy shit! I’m a swimmer! I’m one of the swimmers on the guy swim team!!” <br />
<br />
He quickly walked out of the bathroom, feeling scared one of the girls would see him. He used his new, super-long legs to run down the hall to the swimming pool, where he needed to be. <br />
<br />
As soon as he arrived at the pool, the girls and the coach turned around and addressed him. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Alex! You finally made it!” coach smiled. <br />
<br />
In addition, the same group of fan girls, that Alexandria used to belong to, now swarmed around Alexander as he walked up to the pool. Mary, June, Cindy and Sandy quickly surrounded Alex, who towered over all four of them. <br />
<br />
“Wow, look at his muscles!” Cindy grinned, as she felt Alex’s pecs with her hand. <br />
<br />
“And his abs! They’re so hard!” June giggled, rubbing her hands across Alex’s six-pack abs. <br />
<br />
“You kidding me? He’s the tallest guy on the team!” Sandy laughed, while she checked out the hulking swimmer. <br />
<br />
“Ohh…. Uhh… Hi, girls!” was all Alex could say, since he wasn’t used to receiving so much attention. He just stood there, loving the fact that the girls were just drooling over him. Suddenly, it didn’t matter that he was no longer a girl. He had no idea how he became a guy. Getting the attention was all that mattered. <br />
<br />
“Okay! Everybody back in the pool! Five laps!” the coach shouted as he blew his whistle. <br />
<br />
Alex knew how to swim, and he was the fastest swimmer in the pool. The girls cheered him on as the coach timed the race. And Ty looked on, smiling widely as he saw the results of his handiwork. He was already looking for the next person to transform.</p>
