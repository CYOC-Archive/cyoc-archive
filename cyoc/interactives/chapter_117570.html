<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan, went back to his house after having one of the greatest night of his life, there he saw all of the kids on the Livingroom.<br />
“Hey boys how was your day?” asked Ethan <br />
“It went alright” said Max<br />
“How was work?” asked Luke<br />
“It was great, by the way, Mark, Max, why don’t you just stay over for tonight? It is already late and I don’t think your parents would mind” said Ethan<br />
“Oh no, we can’t stay, we have been here all day, besides you know what my parent think about Zack staying out” answered Mark with a flushed face<br />
“Yeah, we should take Zack home, and I don’t think there’s enough space for all of us” continued Max<br />
“Ok boys, as you say, I’ll just take Evan upstairs” said Ethan with a smile on his face<br />
Ethan carried Evan in his arms and walked to Luke’s room<br />
“Hey, why would you leave?” asked Luke<br />
“It’s just that… well I’m kind of tired and just want to go home” said Mark<br />
“Yeah, and we can just stay some other night” said Max supporting his twin brother.<br />
“Ok then, I guess I’ll just see you tomorrow”<br />
The twins left the house back to their own, carrying Zack by the shoulders like if he was drunk. Then Luke went upstairs and entered his father’s room just when Ethan was undressing. He was sitting at the edge of the bed with his shirt on but without pants just wearing his boxers, and his was taking off his socks.<br />
“Hey dad, so I guess we will be sleeping together for a while” said Luke<br />
“Hey son, yeah, we will have some bonding time, just father and son” said Ethan taking off his shirt, just wearing his boxers<br />
“So this means we can do it even thou Evan is here?”<br />
“Oh come on Luke just join me, your cousin is sleeping in the other room”<br />
Luke took off all his clothes like he did a couple of hours before with Max. He walked straight to his father who was still wearing his boxers and fused his body.<br />
For a moment, Luke was in front of his father and grabbed his shoulders as if he was about to give him a lapdance but then he sat on his father at the time when his legs melted and disappeared onto his father, making only his torso be attached to his father but they were face to face.<br />
“Wow Luke, I was actually thinking about the typical two headed father and son” said Ethan grabbing his son’s back for not letting him fall.<br />
“We can just change if you don’t like it “said Luke<br />
“No, it is fine, I’ll just be the one who has the fun” answered his dad<br />
Ethan, just slowed down one of his hands through Luke’s back and sliced it in the boxers right were Luke’s ass should be but instead it was Ethan’s dick. Luke startled at the feeling of his dad grabbing his own dick because for Luke it was his ass, it was a strange sensation but it started to feel better as Ethan started to get hard.<br />
Luke could feel his father’s dick being rubbed against his back, and the more excited was Ethan the more Luke pressed himself against his dad. Luke was actually feeling something different than his dad, it was pleasure, yes but it wasn’t the kind of pleasure you get from your own dick but from your ass… <br />
Finally Ethan came on Luke’s back, he moaned and then started to gasp on Luke’s shoulder<br />
“(gasp) … that was, amazing…” said Ethan<br />
Then he grabbed Luke’s head with one hand and with the other hand dabbed his cum all over Luke’s back.<br />
“Hey, what’s wrong?” he asked looking at his son but Luke was still holding him like a hug.<br />
“It didn’t feel like cum” that was his answer.<br />
“It didn’t feel like… what are you talking about? I just came on your back, see, don’t you feel it?” Ethan started to rub his hand on Luke’s back again.<br />
“I know, but at the moment you came, it felt different to me” said Luke<br />
“Different, like what?” asked his dad<br />
“It felt like if I was shitting…” <br />
“0h, I see, but just before you were enjoying it, why didn’t you tell me?”<br />
“I was enjoying it but, at the end it felt just weird”<br />
“Well luckily for us it was cum, could you imagine you shitting on yourself? It would be like when you were little” Joked Ethan.<br />
“Dad!” said Luke getting embarrassed <br />
“Hey, it was just a joke. Ok, I know, what if I let you do the same so I can know what it feels like?” proposed Ethan<br />
“Are you serious” asked Luke<br />
“Sure! It would be fun, besides we are already joined”<br />
“Ok, but we will have to lay on the bed sideways”<br />
With that said, Ethan reclined his body on the bed so they both could lie down, Ethan over his right side and Luke on his left, both looking at each other face to face. Then Luke grabbed his dad hairy ass and started to pull.<br />
“Whoa! Luke, what are you doing?” asked Ethan<br />
“Trying to take my dick out of your ass” responded <br />
“Your dick, what?” Ethan was definitely surprised <br />
“You said you wanted to know what it feels like, now it’s my turn to have the fun”<br />
Slowly Ethan could feel how his son’s dick was coming out of his ass in between his butt cheeks until it was fully out.<br />
“Well that wasn’t that bad” said Ethan.<br />
“That was just the begging” said Luke as he grabbed his dick and started to jerk off until it was fully hard, then he rubbed in between his dad hairy buns. “How does it feels dad?”<br />
But without knowing why, Ethan just found that sensation so pleasant that his own dick started to get hard, then just started to jerk.<br />
Both Ethan and Luke were jerking their own dick at a different end of Ethan’s body until they fall asleep and merge their bodies without knowing.</p>
