<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, across town, Sherry&#39;s daughter Megan was deep in the flow of soccer practice with her teammates. The sounds of cleats thudding against the grass, coaches shouting, and players calling for passes filled the air. The group of lean thirteen- to fourteen-year-old girls sprinted across the field, their ponytails flying behind them as they chased the ball with fierce determination. Unbeknownst to any of them, Megan&#39;s mother had just activated the Chronivac, silently altering the world around them.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing seemed different. The players kept running, dribbling, passing, and colliding as they always did. But as the minutes ticked by, small changes started to creep in. Megan’s strides grew longer, her legs stronger, and her lungs seemed to hold more air than before. Her once bony form filled out as muscle gradually built beneath her skin, giving her an uncharacteristic power and confidence. The other girls were changing too. Jenna, who had always been small and quick, suddenly had the strength to muscle past defenders. Tori, the lanky forward, was now a blur of speed, weaving through players like never before.<br />
<br />
Their movements became faster, their tackles harder, and their stamina unrelenting. The game intensified, no one noticing how they seemed to adapt to their new physical prowess without a second thought. Yet, if anyone had looked closer, they might’ve noticed the subtle shift in appearance too. Megan&#39;s long brown hair, once tied back in a ponytail, had shortened into a sleek, messy crop, just brushing the tops of her ears. Tori’s hair was now shaved down in a buzz cut, while Jenna sported a neat fade, emphasizing her new lean, chiseled jawline.<br />
<br />
The scrimmage continued, faster and fiercer, as if the girls were training for something more than just a middle-school game. The air buzzed with raw energy until, at last, their coach blew the whistle, signaling the end of practice.<br />
<br />
Megan, panting heavily, collapsed onto the grass, her body thrumming with adrenaline and exhaustion. She wiped the sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand, startled for a moment at the unfamiliar texture of her short hair. Shrugging it off, she grabbed her water bottle, taking a long gulp before slinging her bag over her shoulder. She grouped up with Tori and Jenna, laughing as they recounted the highlights of the practice. Jenna’s dad, standing at the edge of the field in gray leggings, trainers, and a gray sweatshirt, waved them over with a smile.<br />
<br />
As they piled into Jenna’s dad’s car, the mood was light and easy, a post-practice glow settling over them. Jenna’s dad suggested stopping for slurpees, and the girls cheered. They pulled into a gas station, and Megan practically bounced out of the car, eager for the sweet, icy treat. Inside, the familiar chill of the air conditioning hit them as they rushed toward the slushie machines.<br />
<br />
Megan grabbed a cup and carefully tilted it beneath the slushie machine’s nozzle, her eyes fixed on the stream of bright red liquid swirling into the container. The chilled air from the gas station’s air conditioning sent a welcome shiver across her sun-warmed skin as she adjusted the lever for the perfect consistency. Just as the cup filled to the brim, she reached for a lid, distracted by the noise of her teammates laughing by the candy aisle. She didn’t notice the boy standing beside her until their hands brushed against each other.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry.” he said, his voice soft and slightly shy as he quickly pulled his hand back.<br />
<br />
Startled, Megan glanced up, locking eyes with him. He looked to be her age, maybe a little older, his lean frame casually dressed in a pair of faded jean shorts and a pale spaghetti-strap top that clung lightly to his torso. She noticed the faint outline of bra straps peeking from under the fabric, and her eyes flicked to his face, framed by long, flowing dirty-blonde hair that cascaded over his shoulders. His features were delicate, softened by a touch of light makeup: a hint of eyeliner that made his hazel eyes stand out, and a pale gloss on his lips that shimmered under the store’s fluorescent lights.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Megan froze. Her chest tightened with an unfamiliar sensation, her cheeks flushing as a strange warmth spread through her. She couldn’t look away, caught between confusion and an undeniable flutter of attraction. She had never felt this way before—not about anyone, and certainly not about a boy. Her mind raced, trying to process the rush of emotions swirling in her gut, but she came up empty.<br />
<br />
“No… it’s fine.” she stammered, barely managing to get the words out. Her voice felt small, almost caught in her throat.<br />
<br />
The boy gave her a polite smile, his eyes lingering on hers for just a heartbeat longer before he turned his attention back to his younger brother, who was standing beside him. The little boy, no more than six or seven, wore a cheerful yellow sundress that flared slightly as he moved, balancing on tiptoes to fill his own cup. The older boy crouched to help, carefully fitting a lid onto the smaller cup and murmuring something that made his brother giggle.<br />
<br />
Megan stayed rooted in place, her heart thudding in her chest as she watched him out of the corner of her eye. There was something effortless about the way he moved, a quiet confidence that seemed to radiate from him. It was disarming, magnetic even, and it left her feeling more flustered than she cared to admit.<br />
<br />
Snapping herself out of it, Megan quickly secured the lid on her slurpee and stepped back. Her hands felt clumsy, her fingers fumbling as she adjusted the straw. She stole one last glance at the boy as he straightened up, his hair shimmering slightly under the store lights as he held his brother’s hand. His gaze flicked toward her for just a second, their eyes meeting once more, and Megan’s stomach did an unexpected flip.<br />
<br />
Her heart was still racing as she hurried to join Tori and Jenna at the counter. They were laughing and teasing each other, completely oblivious to the whirlwind of emotions crashing through Megan. She clutched her slurpee, taking a sip in hopes that the icy sweetness would calm the warmth spreading through her chest.</p>
