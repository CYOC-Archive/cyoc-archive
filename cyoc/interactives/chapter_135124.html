<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So do you two play any sports,” Adam asked as the meals arrived. Mike smiled as he looked at the teenage boy, finally he could talk about something he knew about. “Oh yeah,” he said excitedly. “I play baseball, a pitcher actually while Sammy plays volleyball.”<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Adam said. “You twogood enough to make varsity this year?”<br />
<br />
Before Mike could respond, Samantha threw her hand over her boyfriends mouth. “We hope so,” she said quickly. “Mike was a really great pitcher in little league and I grew up playing volleyball with my family. Hopefully we can make varsity this year.” Mike gave Samantha an odd look as she mouthed the words 14 to him. Sighing he glumly began eating his meal.<br />
<br />
“So Adam what’s it like playing for varsity already,” Felicia asked. Adam shrugged as he gazed at his date. “Umm it’s cool,” he blushed. “Thankfully my dad played high school ball but it’s been mom whose been such a big help.”<br />
<br />
“Really your mom,” Felicia asked. Adam nodded feeling a lump begin to form in his throat.<br />
<br />
“Yeah mom is the athlete in the family,” Nate said, covering for his brother. “Grandpa always talks about how great she was at sports when she was a kid. Even though she was a bit of a brat when she was our age.”<br />
<br />
Everyone giggled as they looked at Nate. Happy to be the center of attention instead of his brother, Nate smiled continueing his story. “Yeah from what grandpa says mom was always an impressive athlete, even though she kind of gave it up between 12 and 15. Thankfully she got back into it later on. She actually earned an athletic scholarship for college. My grandparents were overjoyed.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Mike said. “So your bro takes after your mom then.”<br />
<br />
Nate nodded as he smiled at Mike and Samantha. “Yeah definitely,” he said. “Dad was an okay athlete but mom blows him out of the water. Grandpa always brags about how she could do a backhand spring when she was only six.”<br />
<br />
“Six years old,” Gloria said with astonishment. “I didn’t think that was possible. Too bad we couldn’t of seen that.” Once again Gloria’s ring began to glow softly as the group continued to enjoy their date.<br />
<br />
Maddie wiped the sweat from her brow as she finished her quick run. Amazingly she felt fantastic, even after running two miles on the treadmill. Glancing at the clock she was surprised at the time she put up. “Wow haven’t put a time like that up in awhile,” The 28 year old said in astonishment. Taking a drink of water Maddie picked up her cellphone to check for an messages. As she was doing so she noticed even more guys checking her out.<br />
<br />
Maddie was surprised, not only were men her own age checking her out but guys that looked like they were in college were checking her out as well. “Geez whats with these guys today,” she mused. “They act like they’ve never seen a woman work out before.” Looking in the mirror though she smiled.<br />
<br />
Maddie’s body was tone with the almost perfect amount of lean muscle on her body. As she gave her face a once over she was surprised how fresh and youthful it looked. “Wow,” she whispered. “Guess all this hard work is paying off today. I look years younger, my hair looks great and the sweat is making me glow. Gotta remember what brand of face wash that I used today.” Not thinking anything odd she smiled once more at her reflection, not even thinking that she was now almost 20 years younger. As she was doing so she heard her phone begin to vibrate, quickly she picked it up to see a text message.<br />
<br />
“Mom dinner is running a little slow,” it read. “Probably be another 40 minutes before we get the bill.” Maddie smiled as she read the message. “Awesome gives me just enough time to hit the steam room.”<br />
<br />
As Maddie entered the locker room she could see other women gawking at her beauty. Oblivious to the fact she was now only 26 she paused. “Geez even the girls are checking me out,” she thought. Gazing at her appearance she shrugged. In her head she still looked the same. True she looked fresher and in better shape than usual but her mind couldn’t comprehend the fact she was getting younger. The Magic seemed to prevent her from seeing the obvious. <br />
<br />
Maddie quickly changed into her swimsuit and a pair of flip flops as she began making her way towards the steam room. After dressing she had given Her appearance a once over. Maddie was wearing her usual swimsuit, however she found it to be a little baggy around her hips, theighs and butt. Curiously she examined the suit noticing also that her breasts seemed to be straining the material, seeming a little perkier than normal. “Huh it must of gotten stretched in the wash or something,” she thought. Grabbing a towel she wrapped it around her suit as she headed towards the steam room.<br />
<br />
As Maddie entered the steam room she could see a few people already occupying it. Two men in their 40s, a college age women and a couple of teenage boys were relaxing inside. Smiling Maddie made her way towards an empty bench. Settling in the 25 year old put her sandy brown hair up as she leaned back to enjoy the steam. As she glanced around she noticed the two men gazing at her seductively. Maddie returned a sly smile as the two blushed in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Wow this steam feels great,” she thought as she stretched her legs. Taking a look at her legs she was happily surprised to see how lean and beautiful her legs looked. Oddly though her flip flops looked a bit large on her feet, stretching her toes she once again got them to fit correctly on her feet. Letting out a sigh she leaned her head back once more.<br />
<br />
As time wore on Maddie began to feel odd, her suit seemed a bit baggier than before. Looking down at herself she could see it was a bit roomier while the towel she was wearing seemed to have come loose. Making some quick adjustments she retightened the towel while pushing the straps back in place on her shoulders. Looking over her body Maddie was puzzled.<br />
<br />
The muscle on her body, while still lean, seemed less defined than before. Curiously she examined her body finding that while her breasts seemed perkier than before they seemed less full. As she glanced over at the two men in their 40s she noticed they weren’t giving her the same looks as before. The two men before gawked at her without wanting to hide it, now they guiltily looked at her. They had sheepish looks on their face as they gave sideways glances in her direction, like they felt dirty gazing at her body. Oddly she noticed that the teenager seemed more interested now than before. The boy (who couldn’t be more than 18) seemed to be looking at her more and more, slowly sliding over towards where she sat.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” the teen said to Maddie. Maddie turned, confused as to why this boy was suddenly talking to her. “Hi,” she responded slowly, not noticing her voice seemed slightly higher in pitch. “So,” the boy started. “Do you go to college around here?”<br />
<br />
Maddie began to laugh as she shook her head no. “Sorry,” she giggled. “Way too old for college.”<br />
<br />
The boy gave her a confused look as he gazed at her. “Um you sure,” he asked. “Cause I could of sworn you were 20, maybe 21.”<br />
<br />
Maddie blushed, appreciating the comment. “Yeah I’m sure,” she smiled. Looking at her watch she sighed. As she stood she felt her suit shift on her. The material seemed to have stretched some more, shrugging she exited the steam room. As she looked in the mirror outside the 20 year old was surprised but what she saw.<br />
<br />
“Wow that steam did wonders,” she mused gazing at her youthful face. Maddie ran her hands over her body noticing her waist seemed thinner, while her muscle appeared slightly less defined. As she looked at her face she smirked, especially after letting her hair cascade down past her shoulders. “I see what he was saying,” she grinned. “Especially with my hair glowing like this I do look younger.”Glancing at her watch she swore as she started back towards the locker room. The boys should be finished with dinner soon, meaning she would need to pick them up. Maddie had just enough time to take a quick shower before driving to the restaurant and taking the boys to the bowling alley.</p>
