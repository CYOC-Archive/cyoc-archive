<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
On the third day they split off from the caravan, Vivian covered the costs and insisted on it. A fact that left Alec feeling very conflicted. He already didn&#39;t feel like much of a man around her.  But on the other hand it was nice to save some money for the morphing spell.  Maybe he could take her out for a thank you dinner when this was all over.<br />
They traveled until dusk when they made camp. Later that evening after their usual practice session they sat at the campfire. Vivian had removed her top armor revealing a sports bra that strained to contain her large top breasts. This was the first time she removed that armor since they went on this trip. She was lounging next to the fire, poking it with a stick. Alec sat across her, cross legged. Did her breasts seem bigger, or was that the fire? She scratched her lower back and looked up.<br />
&quot;Alec, have you ever used your power on a willing subject? Have you ever gotten feedback from them how it felt?&quot;<br />
Alec shook his head. &quot;No. In my world I didn&#39;t have it and here I didn&#39;t have anyone to ask. Apparently, the people I possess have some awareness. But I don&#39;t know anything else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then how about we find out?&quot; She sat up straight. &quot;Take me and I&#39;ll give you feedback.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure? It might be weird.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just do it, I trust you. Just take me over, walk to the other side of the fire and release me. Actually, maybe move some stuff around for some more details that I might remember.&quot;<br />
Alec looked her in the eye, she seemed serious. &quot;But it&#39;s not a matter of releasing. When I stop possessing you I apparently actually repossess my own body. So there&#39;s no real release to speak off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Same difference.&quot; She shrugged it off, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s try this. I&#39;m curious how it feels and you will learn something as well.&quot;<br />
That last thing at least was a good point. &quot;Okay, let&#39;s do this. Let me get comfortable first.&quot; <br />
&quot;Comfortable? Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because when I posses you, it&#39;s like my own body doesn&#39;t have a driver anymore. It just goes limp and crashes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, that sounds annoying. So what do you do?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting better at planning ahead for it. The first time I did it I was just lucky I didn&#39;t break anything. I&#39;ll just lay down here and put something under my head.&quot;<br />
&quot;But the your body is completely undefended? That&#39;s actually pretty scary. Good thing there&#39;s two of us then. I can look out for you once we reach the witch.&quot;<br />
Alec nodded and lay down on his side, while looking at Vivian. &quot;Possession.&quot;<br />
<br />
A familiar bright light flashed and Alec found himself sitting on the ground on the opposite side of the fire. He saw his own body laying peacefully on the other side.<br />
He immediately felt an annoying itch near her lower back, just above her ass and scratched it. Her fingers found a minor bump. The transformation must still be progressing, he thought. <br />
He looked at her hands, they were smaller, more feminine than his. He made a fist, but they felt strong. He looked down. Two large breasts were in view and blocked the view to the rest. He tugged at the straps from the sports bra, it felt tight around the shoulders and chest area, was it a size too small? He ran her hands over her body. She felt nice at least, toned as well.<br />
He got up and almost tipped over as 4 large weights immediately shifted and nearly pulled him back down. He caught himself and more slowly got up this time. Her weight distribution was completely different than he was used to.<br />
He hefted the lowest pair, the flesh cascaded over and through his fingers, he felt the middle pair rest on top of the bottom pair. These were much heavier than he&#39;d thought. He did a few stretches to get to know the body, Vivian felt very strong indeed. Yet, he was amazed she could train him while these wobbly weights hung from her chest. <br />
He thought back to his time as Amber, she was much smaller, much lighter. Yet, she was also a lot weaker. He did not want to piss off Vivian, though that at least seemed to be a difficult thing to do anyway. She was pretty happy most of the time.<br />
He walked to Vivian&#39;s pack and moved it to the other side of the fire. Like Amber he found himself walking more from the hips, swaying from side to side. He knew what it looked like from following Vivian around and smiled. As ridiculous as he found it, he actually felt sexy walking like this in this body.<br />
The tied together bikini did little to support the lower 4 breasts as he felt them shift and jiggle with every movement. He knew how hot it was to look at from the outside, watching the flesh jiggle and move. But now that he had them, he could feel them jiggle and move.<br />
He felt her crotch heat up, the feeling of having six large tits like this was amazing. Too bad he never tried to do that as Amber. <br />
He wondered how masturbation would feel as Vivian. He imagined himself pinching and kneading those large breasts. Rubbing her cunt. His mind wandered to all the things he could do with her if he&#39;d still have his dick. He felt a familiar hunger in her pants and looked at Vivians hands, maybe... &quot;No, no time for that now.&quot; She trusted him.<br />
He then walked to where his own body was on the ground and sat next to it. Her lowest pair of breasts rested comfortably in her lap. He couldn&#39;t resist and stroked them, trying to make it seem like and accident of course. Her hands felt the nipples beneath the fabric. Okay, he needed to get back now, before he went to far. Besides he was curious what Vivian would remember.<br />
He looked at his own body. &quot;Possession.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another flash of light followed. He was staring at the fire and for the first time after using his power, he didn&#39;t wake up with any bruises. He leaned on his elbows and looked at Vivian.<br />
Her eyes were wide as she stared around and at herself. &quot;Amazing.&quot; He heard her whisper.<br />
&quot;So how did it feel?&quot; and more importantly, &quot;What do you remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, so okay. Wow. That was trippy and weird. It felt like a dream and honestly I barely remember what you did. It was like...&quot; She put her index finger her to her chin and looked up, lost deep in thought. <br />
&quot;It was really like a dream I guess. I mean I already said that. But you know those dreams where something happens and you just randomly decide to fly away. But you have this voice in the back of the head that tells you that&#39;s impossible, but then you do it anyway because this is a dream. It&#39;s like that I guess.&quot; She was silent for a bit.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re aware, but not really. Your...my body does things and I know it&#39;s doing things, but I don&#39;t do them so I don&#39;t know? Does that make sense?&quot;<br />
Alec had no idea what she was rambling on about, but he just nodded. &quot;So what do you remember?&quot;<br />
He noticed Vivian studying his expression, the light of the fire illuminated her face. &quot;You have no idea what I mean do you?&quot;<br />
He shrugged, &quot;Sorry, I generally don&#39;t remember my dreams.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I can&#39;t explain any clearer. But I think you moved my pack. Honestly, if we hadn&#39;t agreed to do this, I would&#39;ve thought I was asleep and dreaming.&quot; She uncrossed her legs and spread them before her, leaning back on her hands. Something about her changed, but he wasn&#39;t sure what. &quot;So did you move my pack?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you said that people remembered, what or who did you posses earlier. I feel bad having such a bad memory of this.&quot;<br />
&quot;My first possession was a harpy...&quot;<br />
&quot;No way! You were a harpy? One of the armed ones or a winged one? Could you fly? Did you fly!&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s armed ones? No I had a winged one then I guess, it was really awkward and I couldn&#39;t fly. Or maybe I could, but I was unable to figure out how in my short time as one.&quot;<br />
Vivian&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Did you lay an egg?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Alec said. &quot;What kind of question is that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just curious. Wouldn&#39;t you like to know what it&#39;s like to lay an egg?&quot;<br />
&quot;No I wouldn&#39;t. Pushing unyielding and large out of a hole in your body doesn&#39;t interest me.&quot; Alec felt a pinch in his pants, no he didn&#39;t want to know that at all. <br />
&quot;Well if I&#39;d hazard a guess, then a harpy is more of a magical creature, who knows how they dream or how their consciousness works. So that may be why she was more aware.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;Or maybe she didn&#39;t know and just guessed it was a trap because she was suddenly somewhere else than her last memory.&quot;<br />
There&#39;s a viewpoint Alec hadn&#39;t considered. &quot;But my second ta...possession was a wizard. When I unpossessed her she flipped out, kicked my a...curse into action...after a big struggle. She seemed far too pissed off to not have been been fully aware.&quot;<br />
Vivian looked at him. &quot;Wizards get training in astral projection and dream readings and whatever other hippy stuff they get up to. She may have been more aware due to training. But this is all just guesswork on my end, I&#39;m neither a harpy, nor a wizard.&quot;<br />
There was a brief moment of silence as Vivian shifted position, she sat cross legged again. Her hands resting in her lap buried underneath her lower breasts.<br />
&quot;So I wasn&#39;t the first girl you possessed?&quot; She flashed a mischievous smile, &quot;What did you do that got her so fired up?&quot;<br />
&quot;I went through her things.&quot; He didn&#39;t lie.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Her tone couldn&#39;t be more incredulous if she&#39;d tried, &quot;You mean to tell me? A boy took over a girls body and only went through her things? And she got pissed off enough to...have a big struggle with you and curse you? Why, this sounds completely believable.&quot;<br />
If the purposeful pause mid sentence hadn&#39;t told Alec enough, the sarcasm at the end was impossible to miss. <br />
&quot;Okay okay, so I may have checked her out a little.&quot; He blushed. &quot;It wasn&#39;t very decent of me, but I wanted to test my power out. I learned my lesson.&quot;<br />
She laughed. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I understand, who wouldn&#39;t want to try someone else&#39;s body out. Especially of the opposite gender. Though you really should&#39;ve asked.&quot; Vivian stared straight into his eyes again, &quot;Tell me, was she hot?&quot; she asked.<br />
A whole bunch of answers flashed through his mind. Not as hot as you, not really, or he could say really hot. But he felt like Vivian was trying to find something out and he wanted to know what. So what was the correct answer here? &quot;She was quite hot. Not as muscular or fit as you though.&quot;<br />
Vivian was fidgeting as she sat. &quot;A yes, my 6 muscles you mean? Actually, now that I think about it, you never told me how she cursed you. What&#39;s your curse?&quot;<br />
Crap. &quot;Well you never told me about yours either, I figured it was a private thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? You could see mine.&quot;<br />
&quot;True, but you said were still transforming, what are you transforming into? A 6 breasted pig?&quot;<br />
&quot;No the witchsss...wait a minute! Are you trying to change the subject? Are you that embarrassed? You know what, I will tell you what I know and then you must tell me the truth.&quot; She held out her hand. &quot;Deal?&quot;<br />
Alec hesitated, he couldn&#39;t tell the hot 6 breasted girl he had a vagina. What if she laughed? What would it do for his future chances? <br />
&quot;Come on, take it. It can&#39;t be worse than what I&#39;m going through I&#39;ll tell you that.&quot;<br />
Alec still hesitated. He really didn&#39;t want to share this. <br />
Vivian retracted her hand and changed position again, this time with her shins beneath her body. &quot;You know what, I think I already know. Let&#39;s see, I haven&#39;t seen you change forms, so it&#39;s not a were-like curse. You&#39;re a bit scrawny, but otherwise look like a normal guy. But you&#39;re really embarrassed by it. We&#39;ve also been training and at no point did I see a tent in your pants, yet you obviously find me hot. No, don&#39;t look so surprised, girls eyes aren&#39;t on their chest no matter how much you keep not staring at them. And you keep slinking off when you need a toilet break. So she either shrank your dick or made it fall off. Well, am I close?&quot;<br />
Damn, she was pretty and smart. &quot;Yes, you&#39;re right. She shrank my dick into nothingness.&quot; Not technically a lie. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine Alec, don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll get the witch and get you your ingredients and turn tiny Alec back into medium sized Alec. Curses happen. Now, as for me. The witch of the west doesn&#39;t really do animal transformations, she leaves those to a witch on another continent. Circle or something I believe her name is. Really weird professional pride that this witch has.<br />
No, she tends to mix and match and merge more. I don&#39;t know what exactly she was planning with me, but based on what the others went through I expect some kind of sexual half pig half human thing. <br />
You remember when I said she had eyes and ears everywhere? There&#39;s clusters of transformed people in the swamp. Some are connected to her, some work for her and others are just there for her entertainment. I figure I was supposed to join the last group.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Alec was trying to get a mental image of whatever Vivian was going to end up as, she changed position again. She sat cross legged once more. An awkward silence fell. There was a question hanging in the air, Alec knew it. It was creating a tension between them.<br />
He could feel it, but what was the question and why hadn&#39;t Vivian just asked it as she usually does. It must be something she&#39;s scared to ask and why does she keep changing the way she sits?<br />
Maybe she wanted a kiss, it felt awkward like those times where you waited just a bit too long saying goodbye to a girl. But she hadn&#39;t really shown any romantic interest in him, unless being nice counted. But in that case Ralof would&#39;ve wanted to bang him as well. He felt his groin tingle and shuddered. Let&#39;s not pursue that train of thought.<br />
Thinking back, she changed when she broached the subject of his powers. And she started shifting after he&#39;d taken her body. Could it be she somehow liked it? Despite not remembering much of the experience.<br />
&quot;Is there anything else you&#39;d like to test out with your power someday?&quot; She interrupted his thoughts, her voice sounded uncharacteristically timid.<br />
&quot;Are there talking dragons? Otherwise I&#39;d like to try that at least once.&quot; He said absentmindedly. What was she looking for?<br />
&quot;Aww man, fire breathing and stuff? That would be friggin awesome. You know dragons also lay eggs, right?&quot; She replied.<br />
&quot;Then I wont get a pregnant one? Do dragons get pregnant before laying eggs? I seriously have no idea how dragons work.&quot; <br />
&quot;Maybe you can find a big manly dragon, Alec the dragon...&quot; she said as her voice trailed off. <br />
This did not feel like their normal way of talking at all. Silence followed.<br />
She had a sense of humor and this tension was unbearable, so fuck it. &quot;So...&quot; Alec started. &quot;W..would you like me to take your body again?&quot;<br />
For the first time since they met he noticed Vivian turn red in the face. Her mouth opened and closed. Her eyes darted around trying to find the answer she wanted to give.<br />
She didn&#39;t laugh though, which told Alec all he needed to know.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly quickly she recomposed herself and met his gaze. &quot;Okay, so listen. Somehow the thought of someone taking my body for a spin. Having some...shall we say, fun with it while I can&#39;t do anything except sort off be along for the ride just gets me hot.&quot; She stared him right in the eyes, she was going all in on this, shame be damned. He felt envious at how easy she just asked that.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s definitely the curse.&quot; she added. Okay, so there was still a little shame.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Alec responded, somehow feeling like he had all the cards got to his head, he immediately regretted his answer. <br />
The mood changed, she crossed her arms and legs, but avoided his eyes. &quot;Okay, so if you don&#39;t want to, that&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s just keep this between us okay. I understand, you&#39;ve already been me.&quot; <br />
&quot;Nono, that&#39;s..Sorry, that&#39;s not what I meant. I mean I was just a little surprised. If it makes you happy I&#39;ll take your body for another spin.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on, stop acting like you&#39;re doing it just for me. I think you want to do it a little as well right?&quot; She bent forward and pushed her shoulders slightly together causing her ample bosom to be squished together, giving him an excellent view of her cleavage. She added in a sultry tone, &quot;I&#39;ve seen you look after all.&quot; <br />
Alec felt himself heating up and wishing he still had his dick. &quot;Okay, fine. I&#39;m a little curious.&quot; He fell silent for a second, before he asked, &quot;So before I take your body again, is there anything you don&#39;t want me to do?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I won&#39;t remember much anyway. Though I guess, if a crowd suddenly forms in our little section of nowhere then I&#39;d appreciate it if you don&#39;t make me the village idiot or bicycle. Just, try my body out a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec lay down again and looked up at Vivian. &quot;You absolutely sure?&quot; She nodded. <br />
&quot;Possession.&quot; A flash of light followed and he was looking at himself again. The heavy weight of six breasts tugging at his chest and the annoying itch above her ass crack, he was definitely her again. He just sat there for a moment, so now what? She basically gave him permission to do whatever, which was a bit overwhelming.<br />
He had an idea of what he could do, but somehow it just didn&#39;t feel right just now. He wasn&#39;t in the mood. There was one thing though. He reached around her back and undid the knot holding the lower bra&#39;s together. Out flopped her four lower breasts. He then started pulling at the sport bra, that thing was too tight. As he slipped it off, it let the top two drop on the bottom four. The cool evening wind brushed her nipples, he felt them harden in response. A weird feeling.<br />
He then got up. Free from their restraints, the six large breasts shook and rubbed over each other. He held one in her hands, the soft smooth flesh felt great. <br />
He went to her pack, he sat down next to and opened it. He found two narrow bladed short swords. They reminded him of his own, except they were slightly longer and had more of an S shape to them. He found a change of clothes, some underwear. A map. At the bottom of the pack he found a pair of arm braces. There was an intricate pattern on of glittery green lines on them. Like vines the crawled over and under each other, curling and twisting and finally ending near the wrist where a small green gem was placed. The leather was soft yet sturdy.<br />
He was about to put everything back when his hand brushed a rough ridge on the inside. He peered in the bag, while feeling around and found a hidden zipper. He reached in and found what felt like a rubbery wand. He pulled it out and nearly dropped it in surprise. He held a medium size detached penis, complete with balls. He squeezed it softly, no, not a penis. It was a dildo. He smirked. She was a lot kinkier than he&#39;d expected her to be.<br />
He squeezed it again, firm, yet it still gave way. It wasn&#39;t quite as hard as his own dick could be. It wasn&#39;t quite as big as he was either. Fascinated, he flopped it around and ran his hand over the shaft. It felt so familiar, he&#39;d missed it. A warmth was spreading in her groin.<br />
&quot;Oh, you want this?&quot; He said to Vivian. Not that she could hear him. He was the boss now, he had her. He cleared her throat. He ran the dildo between her legs and whispered softly &quot;You really want this?&quot;<br />
Her groin tingled in response, a shiver spread over her body. He grabbed handful of tit and started kneading, toying with the erect nipple. <br />
He felt the empty feeling in her vagina. An aching feeling, a need to be full. To be complete. He ran her hand between her legs and the muscles tensed in response. He put the dildo between her fat tits and massaged the object. Imagining it was his own dick.<br />
Soon her hands left her breasts. He slipped off her shorts and thong and felt the cold air on her hot and wet pussy. Her stroked it, it felt different from Amber. Less sensitive, yet still good. His fingers explored the folds of her vulva, they felt bigger than his or Ambers. He kept probing and gasped when he finally her clitoris. He tapped the tiny nubbin and felt the pleasure course through her body. <br />
He slipped a finger in her wet hole and whispered. &quot;You want more don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
He felt her vagina clench around his finger. He, no she wanted more. She needed more. He teased her cunt by dragging the veined dildo across her mound. It felt like magnetism, a strong near irresistible pull to put it in. He felt her hips almost move up by itself, allowing more room near her wet folds. But he resisted. Alec knew what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Rubbing her soaking pussy, her 6 large tits jiggling, he made his way to his own body. He felt the tug on her hips, the desire of her vagina to be filled. &quot;Not yet.&quot; He whispered. He crouched over his motionless body and removed his shirt. <br />
Slowly, he moved from his head to his pants. Dragging her six large tits over his body, he could feel the warmth of his own body on her nipples and skin.<br />
He unzipped his pants and slipped the dildo in them. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a good fuck.&quot; <br />
He stood over his body, her vagina aching to be filled. Slowly he lowered her on himself. When he felt the tip of the dildo he grabbed shaft and teased her opening with the tip. He felt it clench, he needed it.<br />
He guided the tip to the vagina. It didn&#39;t immediately slip in, he pushed it through and gasped. Was this what it felt like. He felt so full. So much better than a finger. How would a real dick feel? <br />
He started bouncing up and down. Kneading two of her fat tits while letting the others slap around. <br />
He gasped. Faster. He kept bouncing, grinding her hips against his. The pressure was building, he needed release. But it wasn&#39;t enough. <br />
He rolled off his own body, with an audible plop, the dildo slipped from her vagina. He scrambled to grab it and gasped as he plunged it back in, moaning loudly. One hand pumped and one hand rubbing her clit. The pressure inched closer.<br />
He groaned, going even faster, biting her lip. It was coming, closer and closer. He needed release now. <br />
Holding his breath, he an explosion hit him. He gasped for air, her back arched, her hips bucking, her body shaking. Until it finally subsided, shortly followed by a warm blanket slowly landing on him. He lay there basking in the afterglow of her explosive orgasm. Gasping for breath.<br />
Her body felt heavy and tired, he looked at his own.</p>
