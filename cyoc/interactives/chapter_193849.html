<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">However, Isaac was not going to be in piece for much longer. Many of the pirates had been given shore leave and had immediately frequented the taverns and some of the more eager were early arrivals at Madam Astoria’s. <br />
<br />
They told of the strange goings on the latest voyage including how the 1st mate Isaac had disappeared and how the Captain had escorted a pretty lass ashore who must have been hiding in Isaac’s cabin. It was soon talk of the town, people were speculating that the girl must have done away with Isaac.<br />
<br />
Henrietta and some of the other working girls heard these story&#39;s from some of their first clients of the evening. She put two and two together and realised that Isabelle must have been the woman found in Isaac’s cabin - The woman who had supposedly murdered the young pirate. Isaac had been a favourite of Henrietta&#39;s and she was not happy. In a break between clients she conscripted two of her colleagues Bessie and Faith to help her teach this upstart a lesson.<br />
….<br />
Isaac heard a knocking on the door. “Who is it?”<br />
<br />
“Henrietta, Madam asked me to bring you up some stew”<br />
<br />
Isaac was hungry, She had been contemplating for the last hour the prospect of leaving the room and seeking dinner but had so far not summoned up the courage to be seen in a dress. She had heard the background noise of rowdiness increase as the sky grew dark and guessed that many of her former colleagues were now availing themselves of Madam&#39;s hospitality. She immediately unlocked the door to let Henrietta in.<br />
<br />
In a whirlwind of fluttering skirts, three women entered, grabbed Isaac and she found herself carried to the Captain’s bed. She had a knife pressed against her cheek and a menacing Henrietta whispering in her ear. “Don’t scream or I’ll finish you off here and now”<br />
<br />
Isaac was used to tense situations. More than once he had been in a brawl with knives and swords. The previous culprits had paid dearly. However, on the previous occasions he had been with his comrades and brute strength had won out. Now she was alone and in a weak female body and had been caught by surprise.  With the knife at her throat she knew fighting back was a risk. She would have to use her wit.<br />
<br />
She did not have the strength to get out of the grip of Henrietta’s companions who she recognised as Faith and Bessie. Bessie a dark skinned girl was another of Madams girls that Isaac had spent time with.<br />
<br />
“I’ll stay quiet” she managed to whisper.<br />
<br />
“There is a rumour going around that you are the girl found on the Crimson Pearl. Is that true?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” said Isaac quietly with the knife was still pressing tightly against her. <br />
<br />
“I won’t hesitate to cut you. Were you in Isaac’s cabin?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” It was the truth<br />
<br />
“What did you do to Isaac? He was a favourite of mine”<br />
<br />
“Nothing. I can explain. Just move the knife” <br />
<br />
Henrietta looked at Bessie. “What do you think?”<br />
<br />
“I say cut her. She has admitted she is the girl. Prove that we mean business. Then we will find out what she did to our Isaac”<br />
<br />
“Gladly” Isaac felt the tip of the knife push into her cheek. Her instinct was to scream, somehow she managed not to. She couldn’t help but struggle as Bessie and Faith held her tight.<br />
<br />
“She’s a calm one” said Henrietta. She withdrew the knife far enough that Isaac could see a drop of blood on the sharp tip. “That’s just to show we mean business. Next time I start carving you”<br />
<br />
“What do you want?”<br />
<br />
“What did you do with Isaac?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing”<br />
<br />
“Then where is he? They say he has disappeared” The knife was once more against Isaac’s face.<br />
<br />
“Here” Isaac decided she had no choice but to tell the truth<br />
<br />
“Where?”<br />
<br />
“I’m Isaac”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Honey. Your lying to us. You are definitely not Isaac” She felt the knife stick into her once more. Henrietta slashed the sharp knife down Isaac’s cheek. This time Isaac did scream. She was surprised at the high pitched sound that came out of her throat.<br />
<br />
“Shut her up before Madam hears her” Isaac found the shirt she had arrived in shoved into her mouth<br />
<br />
“You can’t kill her without proof” It was Faith who didn’t want to be part of murder.<br />
<br />
“It’s the truth. I’m Isaac. A magic amulet turned me into this” but the sound was muffled by her gag. <br />
<br />
There was no reply. Isaac realised the girls were no longer looking at her. They were looking towards the door.<br />
<br />
Then she heard a voice “Drop that knife! Now!” Isaac recognised it as Madam Astoria’s. Henrietta dropped the knife. Onto the previously clean bedspread. Suddenly there was a big red stain on the bed.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is going on? What have they done to you Isabel?”</p>
