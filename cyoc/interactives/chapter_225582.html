<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike Evans Sr. was a 45 year old father trying to connect with his son, Mike Evans Jr., who went by his middle name “Josh”. The 20 year old college student was currently back home for break and didn’t seem eager to be spending time with his dad. On his wife’s insistence, he bought two zoo tickets, hoping to relive his past memories at the amazing zoo they frequented often when he was young father with his loving son. But the present didn’t seem to be living up to the memories they had once made.<br />
<br />
The zoo was dirty and worn down. Besides the two of them there were hardly any visitors. And who could blame them? There were barely any exhibits. Most of the animals having been moved to better zoos that could sustain them in a better habitat. And the few exhibits that did remain were nothing impressive.<br />
<br />
Currently Mike and Josh were in front of the tiger exhibit. It was a small gated habitat currently with only a single tiger. A 5 year old, adult male tiger lazily slept on a smooth boulder while Josh sat on a bench and texted on his phone.<br />
<br />
“I wonder where the other tigers are?” Mike asked aloud. “Remember? You used to love watching them all play and interact.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… sure... yeah.” Josh said, he hadn’t heard a single word his dad had said. He seemed to be engrossed in the conversation on his phone.<br />
<br />
“C’mon sport.” Mike swiped his phone out of his hands. “You used to love tigers. I even used to call you tiger all the time when you were little.”<br />
<br />
Josh angrily glared at his father and grabbed his phone back.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m not a big tiger fan anymore. Especially when our college rivals mascot is one.” He quickly resumed his previous actions and checked his social media feeds. “Just tell me when it’s time to go Dad.”<br />
<br />
Mike sighed disappointedly. This wasn’t going at all as he had hoped. He had wanted to deepen his bond with his son. And he had hoped this zoo would be the key. But like most things nowadays about his son, he was wrong. He just didn’t know him that well anymore. Mike wished there was a way to connect with his son again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the virus entered Mike’s body, although he had no idea. However, Mike was beginning to feel a sudden heat rush throughout his body. He couldn’t quite assess what he was feeling as the heat enveloped his body, unaware he was craving to breed with another male. <br />
<br />
Mike wiped the newly formed sweat off his forehead. Perhaps it was time to go. The sun seemed to be making him sweat uncontrollably and overheat. Unsure if just instinct or his regular actions, Mike grabbed his son’s shoulder to get his attention.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, the heat had passed from Mike and into Josh. Josh dropped his phone in shock as the heat spread throughout his body, making him begin to fidget. Probably because he was younger, the effects seemed to have a bigger effect on Josh as his sex drive was higher.<br />
<br />
Josh stood up and pulled his shirt off, revealing his hairless skinny but toned chest and stomach, before stripping his pants and boxers off. Now nude, his penis was standing at full mast, erect and dripping pre-cum. <br />
<br />
Mike watched his son in amazement and in arousal as he stripped in front of him. Displaying his naked figure. Not questioning anything, Mike followed suit and removed his clothing, to reveal his hairy dad bod underneath. His cock also fully errect and beginning to drip pre-cum.<br />
<br />
Mike walked up to his son and began to kiss him, placing his tongue in his mouth. Since they were the same height at 6’ 4” they had no problems with embracing one another. They continued to French kiss as their bodies produced a strange smell.<br />
<br />
Being the closest animal to the pair, Michael the tiger was instantly awoken as he felt a sudden urge to join the two humans viewing him. He made his way to a tree and quickly climbed up before jumping over the gate and tackling the two men.<br />
<br />
The three finally united, they began to blend together as they merged. There were no screams and shocks of surprise to be had as the three were found in a strange aroused and trance-like state and could not react. Their form took mere minutes to reshape as they unified, creating a new singular body for the three. Combining the feline and human structure, the two men and tiger successfully combined before they became conscious again.<br />
<br />
Mike opened his eyes first and looked down to see…</p>
