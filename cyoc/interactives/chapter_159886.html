<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Fallen Island Magical Correctional Facility hosted some of the most evil warlocks, wizards and witches in the magical world. Beyond the jail’s walls were minions of darkness who committed unspeakable acts. Genocide, rape, murder, forced transmutation. If there was a magic and non magic crime to be committed, these evil people were guilty of committing them. <br />
<br />
In the deepest part of the facility, behind a concrete wall, sat one of the most evil wizards in the universe, Victor Roshkovich. Although he hadn’t committed the type of atrocities that others in the facility had, he had the strong ability to flee imprisonment and then avoid capture. He was a high level flight risk, especially considering how long he evaded capture before his imprisonment. 150 years+ Earth years, longer than any other evil wizard in magical history. As such, it was deemed after his trial and guilty conviction that he needed to be held in solitary confinement. Only then did the court feel he would serve out his ten thousand year sentence. Unfortunately for the magical world, this was not to be the case.<br />
<br />
The magical world would drive a mere mortal insane, being that time flies faster there than on Earth. One magical year can pass by in the course of a week on Earth. Such disparities would be problematic for anyone not familiar or comfortable with the drastic changes in the passage of time. This was not the case for Victor Roshkovich. <br />
<br />
Being that he had lived practically his entire thousand year plus life on Earth, he was still adjusted to the biorhythms and metrics that accounted for the passage of human time. As such, he realized that, despite more than one thousand years in a magical prison facility, he had only spent a little more than twenty Earth years here. <br />
<br />
Being fed in rapid intervals bothered Victor, who would turn down most of his meals, to the astonishment of the prison guards. Sleep never came for Victor, who preferred to rest via the powers of meditation. While those who observed him just assumed he was dreaming, what they were not aware of was that Victor was rebuilding his energy core and growing more powerful with each meditative breath.<br />
<br />
Over the course of his time in prison, Victor did two things undetected by the guards. He regained the strength he had lost in the battle against the magical police force and he slowly, but surely, weakened the foundations to which the concrete wall was supported. If the magical prison guards had known this earlier, they may have been able to prevent what was about to occur. By the time they knew what was coming, it was already too late to stop him.<br />
<br />
Sitting in his cold, damp prison cell, Victor began what would be his final meditation in prison. Throughout his time here, the only thing on his mind, besides a plan to escape, was to seek revenge on Freddy Benson and Michael Scavaloni. Out of all of the threats he had dealt with in the past, none proved as powerful as them. What angered him more than anything was that they weren’t magical beings at all, in his estimation. They were just a couple of lucky punks who used his love of his daughter Sofya to pin him down and leave him vulnerable to apprehension. <br />
<br />
Victor vowed that he would eliminate them once and for all. He would have gotten revenge on the old man from the magic shop, but he had determined in his meditation that he had passed away not too long ago. He also would have sought revenge on the man who had employed him as a thief and then lied to him about what his situation was actually like. Soon after the trial, someone else had the mysterious boss and the rest of his gang murdered. This was also discovered in his meditation.<br />
<br />
“No matter” Victor thought to himself, as his eyes were closed and he was deep in thought. “The less people I have to worry about eliminating, the better.”<br />
<br />
Finishing his last minute meditation, Victor opened his eyes and felt it was finally time. Thousands of magical years had passed leading up to this moment. It was make or break time; literally.<br />
<br />
Summoning a large amount of strength, Victor began to use his mind to shake at the foundations of the concrete wall. On the other side of the wall, two prison guards who were assigned to watch him began to feel the floor shake.<br />
<br />
“What was that?” one guard asked, with nervousness in his voice. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know” the other guard replied. “I hope it’s not…”<br />
<br />
Before he could finish his sentence, the concrete wall flung off and splattered the two guards to the wall on the other side of the hall. In the rubble lied two crushed bodies, oozing blood from the corpses of the prison guards. Levitating off of the floor, Victor began to speed his way out of his cell and make his way to the exits. <br />
<br />
“At long last” Victor thought to himself, as he travelled at light speed. “I’m finally free.”<br />
<br />
Guards in other parts of the jail noticed the floor and walls shake, before seeing a flash of light pass them by. <br />
<br />
“What was that?” a guard asked aloud. <br />
<br />
The head of the prison facility spotted a foot in the beam of light, deducing that it could only be one individual.<br />
<br />
“Victor Roshkovich!” the head guard exclaimed. “Shoot at him now! Don’t let him escape!”<br />
<br />
Despite their efforts to form a chain link around the front exit and shoot magic weapons at him with everything they had, Victor’s light ball knocked the army of guards over like bowling pins. With a powerful impact, he busted down the front door. One second later, Victor had done what no other wizard had done before him. He escaped a facility that was previously thought to be inescapable. The only saving grace being that the guards quickly shut the door before any other prisoners could be released along with him. <br />
<br />
Through a maze of woozy guards, some of them badly hurt, the head guard summoned a communication device and dialed a mysterious number. After a few short rings, a pick up noise could be heard on the other end. <br />
<br />
“Sergeant, this is a code alpha alpha red! I repeat, this is a code alpha alpha red! Call in the magical police force immediately! We have to stop him before he makes his way back to the museum!”<br />
<br />
Back on Earth....</p>
