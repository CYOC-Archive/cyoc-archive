<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
Gabe had gotten done at the pool and headed into the locker room shortly after Jackson did, both young guys looking forward to the afterparty. Jackson for his part wasn&#39;t quite at the point in his transformation where he was eagerly moving to engage with men - though he was seeing things a little differently than usual, but Gabe was more than at the point where he felt attraction toward guys. Jackson for his part started to get undressed from his swim gear - heading over toward the showers.<br />
<br />
And wasn&#39;t it just typical that something would happen near the showers...?<br />
<br />
Gabe found himself heading over there because the bathrooms were nearby there as well, needing to leak the hose. He stopped when he heard the tell tale sound of the showers starting up. Gabe felt his heart beat a little bit faster. He gulped and wondered where Terry had run off to. He was nowhere near ready to act on their plan. He had thought both he and Terry both would be ready and able to go with someone close by. And let alone the fact Gabe was having major second thoughts about their plan.<br />
<br />
It seemed too shortsighted, and what if they both ended up somehow enjoying what was happening? Ohh man where was Terry...? <br />
<br />
Gabe despite himself - and his earlier bravado just days ago - found himself moving to try and get a better look. He felt uneasy and shy, not keen on getting spotted so excited and shivering like this. He saw himself in one of the mirrors nearby, and wondered briefly when his tan became so good. When his tight, toned little body grew into such a look...? S-Surely the girls, once Gabe got this outta his system, would love how tan and tight he was.<br />
<br />
...Right?<br />
<br />
Gabe turned around the corner and looked around to see something that immediately left him clutching his groin, biting his lip and desperately horny. He could see just standing there in the midst of the spray of the showerhead Jackson White standing there. Something seemed different about Jackson lately. His muscles seemed larger, more well toned than ever, and was there something about his jawline? His hair seemed different too. Gabe couldn&#39;t tell what it was. But he knew he liked what he saw.<br />
<br />
But there was no way he could just...approach.<br />
<br />
Jackson was one of the biggest jocks in the school! And...wait, wasn&#39;t Gabe once...? No, no, Gabe wasn&#39;t. He was like this. This desperately horny guy dealing with all these intrusive gay thoughts - surely that was all it was. How Gabe wished he could walk over and feel Jackson&#39;s tightly muscled back, test his powerfully muscled chest and arms, really dig his fingers into the grooves between his abs, that tight washboard making Gabe feel like he could just drool...<br />
<br />
And then Jackson started cleaning his cock. Jackson didn&#39;t even notice Gabe was there. He was just feeling up and lightly breathing as he let the water drip down and clean him off. His tool seemed bigger than usual, stronger and more well developed. Gabe bit his lip lightly again. Again imagining himself in a thoroughly unusual position for him. And Jackson did not even know he was there.<br />
<br />
Jackson started lightly rubbing at his cock, murmuring under his breath in some sing song voice about some girl getting up on him like that. He saw Jackson tense and tighten his ass, thrusting under the water, toying with himself. Jackson was just...toying with himself. Gabe found himself thrusting into his own hand. He had to keep quiet or his blissful circumstances would be significantly disrupted. This...this was almost like sex, experiencing this kind of an extensive tease.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly and perhaps ironically, Gabe held himself to the idea of the plan far longer than Terry had. He told himself that as soon as he got off somehow with Jackson, he was gonna just...go on with his day. Go out with one of those fetching girls out there. Enjoy their presence and really get off like the straight boi---boy he knew he was. Gabe gulped and he felt something give inside of his shorts. His hips thrust a few more times.<br />
<br />
He realized what he was undergoing, and desperately tried to stop himself.<br />
<br />
But there was no halting his orgasm at this phase. His ass clenched, and Gabe&#39;s cock pulsed, and the burgeoning twink came, his shorts pulled down just in time to avoid staining the front. He shook and pulled his shorts back up. He still had to piss...dammit. Gabe kept walking and did what he came in there to do, thinking about what he just did all the while. And what might happen in the afterparty.<br />
<br />
A bit later he came back over to the lockers, seeing Jackson getting dressed for the afterparty. His shirt tight against his muscled chest, his abs outright showing a bit even through the thin material of his shirt. His jeans flattered the jock&#39;s bubble butt, and the athlete knew it. Jackson - true to form - didn&#39;t even know what had happened earlier, &quot;Hey dude, you ready for a wicked awesome after party?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah...you know I am.&quot; Gabe said, looking around, &quot;I hope Terry comes back over. I&#39;d like having him at the party...as my friend! As my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you two seem pretty close these days.&quot; Jackson remarked, and then seemed to think of something, &quot;Lots of cuties gonna be at the afterparty, you excited?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You know it, Jackson.&quot; As Jackson fully got dressed and started to head out, Gabe followed. Thinking already about what was gonna happen at the afterparty, and whether he&#39;d be able to control himself there surrounded by such obvious displays of sexuality and lust. He was already not sure about his own sexuality. But this was just gonna tempt him further than he could control...<br />
<br />
As they left, Gabe started looking around for any sign of Terry...</p>
