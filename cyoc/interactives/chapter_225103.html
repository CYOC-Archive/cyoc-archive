<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenna and Richard had no choice but to return to Madame Illusia&#39;s tent if the wanted to fight her.  And so, Richard drove the truck back to the carnival.  When they arrived at the carnival, they both decided to  run into the tent, tag-team Madame Illusia, and knock her unconscious.  Both Jenna and Richard Rushed into the tent screaming, but only made it half way before Madame Illusia froze them in place, moved them through the air and left them suspended slightly above stage.  Only two people on stage were horrified, but didn&#39;t dare move or say a word.  Everyone else was either too dumb to understand or they were completely indifferent.  The crowd knew that something unique was about to happen and watched the show with deep interest.  &quot;Ahh, I see my freaks are back.  Jenna, I sense that you have no desire to work anymore.  And you Richard, aren&#39;t you happy with your new strength?  &quot;No!&quot;, both Jenna and Richard yelled in unison.  Jenna yelled, &quot;I&#39;m tired of cutting myself.&quot;  In turn Richard yelled, &quot;I&#39;m tired of being tortured, I deserve care, respect, and dignity!&quot;.  &quot;Oh, I see.  Well, I don&#39;t really need anymore in my life, I have a handful as it is.  However, I can&#39;t leave you to your own devices anymore.  Since you were freaks before, you shall be freaks again.  But, fortunately, I promise you that you&#39;ll be well taken care of and Jenna, you won&#39;t have to worry about cutting yourself anymore.  Madame then wrinkled her nose as two large glass enclosures appeared that looked like aquariums.  The glass they were made of was thick and bullet proof.  There was no way anyone would break the glass by smashing it with an axe or a sledgehammer.  The top and bottom of the glass were made of extremely thick steel that couldn&#39;t be cut with a plasma cutter because they were so thick and heat resistant.  There was no way for anyone to get in or out unless they were magically teleported.  Inside each enclosure a fleshy latex bag formed.  Out of the latex bags, two thin tubes  and a slightly larger one grew out and attached themselves to to the glass enclosures.  Just outside each glass enclosure, the tubes again grew out.  One tube in each enclosure grew out to and expanded into a feeding pump.  One for each enclosure.  The other thin tube of each enclosure snaked out and then expanded forming a breathing ventilator.  Again, one ventilator for each enclosure.  A fourth tube formed from each enclosure that was the same size as the other large one that had formed inside the enclosure to the latex bag.  However this time instead of connecting to the latex bag, this tube along with the other snaked its way and expanded forming a larger tube which again expanded until the two larger tubes from both tanks fused and became one larger one that eventually expanded into a hot water heater who&#39;s temperature was set to exactly 98 F or around 36.5 C.  The first thing Madame did to Jenna and Richard was to magic away the voice box in their throats, they wouldn&#39;t need them anymore.  Then the crowd watched and Richard and Jenna were stripped of all hair.  leaving them bald and with no body hair.  Pain begin to form in both Jenna&#39;s and Richard&#39;s throats and stomach areas as tubes formed making it so they could be hooked to the thin tubes connected to the latex bags.  It was necessary because they needed to be fed and they needed to breath.  They tried to scream in pain, but couldn&#39;t due to the removal of their voice boxes.  Jenna and Richard watched while their wrists and ankles melted into their arms and legs rendering them unable to grasp anything or be able to walk.  Jenna then watched as her scars healed.  They were finally ready to be sealed into their brand new latex homes.  No one had a clue what was going on and looked on stunned.  It didn&#39;t matter if they were Richard or Jenna, the crowd. or anyone on stage aside from Madame Illusia.  Only a couple of the babies, one retard and the dog were asleep.  Madame teleported Richard and Jenna inside their enclosures.  They were suspended in air mid-way as the tubes sticking out of their throats and stomachs snaked their way inside the latex bags and connected themselves to the tubes coming out of the bags.  Then the bag rose up and started covering Richard and Jenna until they were fully inside.  The bags were slightly translucent, enough to barely make out what was inside them and Jenna and Richard could still kind of see vague shapes and shadows as well as light, though it was a bit dimmed inside.  With the bags now suspended in air, they had completely sealed shut.  Two latex extensions from each bag stretched themselves, one up and one down until they attached themselves to the top and bottom of the glass enclosures.  Yet another hose formed on the bottom of each bag snaked their way down to each enclosure floor and attached themselves.  However Jenna and Richard were not attached to these tubes.  After all, they were still going to wet and mess themselves since they had no other choice.  That reminded Madame, she removed the muscles and nerves that controlled Jenna and Richard so that all they could do now was helplessly pee and mess themselves.  It didn&#39;t matter that they were in a latex bag, that&#39;s what the drain in the bag was for.  They&#39;d just have to deal with sharing the water in their latex bag with their urine and feces until the the urine and feces decided to go down the drain hose.  Jenna and Richard were stretching the latex trying to get out.  Everyone watching could see an elbow poking out or a head pressed against the latex.  But no matter what Jenna and Richard did, they could not break through the latex, only stretch it.  Magically, the machines fired up.  Jenna and Richard noticed that they could no longer control their breathing as the ventilators breathed for them.  The crowd watched as a white liquid made its way through the feeding tubes until the liquid disappeared behind the latex bags.  Warm water started filling up both enclosures and both latex bags.  Finally a dim red light that couldn&#39;t be seen turned on shining down from the top of the tank.  When the water was at full capacity Jenna and Richard could no longer see anyone outside of their latex bags due to the red light obscuring the shapes and shadows.  However, everyone outside the enclosure could still faintly see Jenna and Richard inside.  Madame had one more job to do before these two freaks were finished.  She walked up to the tanks and placed her right pointer finger on Jenna&#39;s glass and her left one on Richard&#39;s.  Inside, both people slowly started to lose their intelligence.  Both fought, but it was no use, Madame took everything leaving them with the mind of a newborn.  Neither Jenna nor Richard were aware where they were at.  They didn&#39;t even know who they were.  They were incapable of thought, much less planning.  They could no longer form any memories.  All they had were proto-thoughts.  These were nothing more than emotions from the stimuli that surrounded them.  At the moment, both Jenna and Richard were content.  &quot;You see, folks, as stated before I don&#39;t really need anymore children, but I also don&#39;t like to let my freaks go.  Jenna and Richard seem happy to be in their brand new artificial wombs, look and see!&quot;, said Madame Illusia.  Everyone who was competent and awake looked toward the tanks.  Inside, were two latex sacks that wiggled and jiggled a little bit as both occupants spasmed forcing their limbs to jerk and move uncontrollably  Inside, Jenna and Richard could faintly hear voices, but it didn&#39;t really register in their brain.  All they knew is that they were content.  The crowd clapped, cheered, and laughed.  Those who cared or were aware were still stunned, but did not dare to challenge Madame Illusia.</p>
