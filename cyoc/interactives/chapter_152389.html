<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The familiar tone of a text message coming into Shane&#39;s phone finally woke him up. He remembered waking up sometime during the night to Luke stroking him off, they ended up fooling around, and the dried mess on both of them confirmed the memory as something that wasn&#39;t a dream. Light was streaming in through the bedroom window and Luke&#39;s arm was currently draped across his chest, but he managed to pull himself free and get to his phone.<br />
<br />
&#39;Come over around 10, gotta talk about that favor you owe me.&#39; It was from Pete. Shane shot back a quick confirmation that he&#39;d be there while idly scratching at his chest. It itched. God how it itched. It wasn&#39;t even stubble, but he could feel the raised bumps of the hairs starting to grow back.<br />
<br />
Looking over his shoulder at Luke he considered just growing it back in, he could with the Chronivac, but they had a bet and that&#39;d be cheating. Maybe another way.. For the first time since yesterday morning he dipped into his own profile, digging down till he found an option for hair growth speed, and tweaked his to be a little bit higher. Committing the change caused the stubble on his chest to suddenly appear. It still itched a little, but he knew it would be over quicker. And he found he did like rubbing his fingers over the prickly hairs. He got so distracted by it he almost didn&#39;t notice another hand joining in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, your hair grows in fast.&quot; Luke&#39;s arm wrapped around his shoulder, playing with Shane&#39;s chest stubble, which led to them having another tussle on the bed, pawing at each other&#39;s chests and cocks until they lay next to each other with a fresh mess mixing with the old.<br />
<br />
Luke looked over at the clock. &quot;Gotta get ready for work, too.&quot; He sounded disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised to meet up with a friend, today, anyway. But I&#39;ll give you a ride to work, just need to, uh, get cleaned up.&quot; Shane found himself idly rubbing at his chest and stomach again, and let it drop back to the sheets.<br />
<br />
Luke noticed though and laughed. &quot;I told you it was kind of erotic.&quot; He slowly got up and looked down at Shane. &quot;You know, the shower in this place is big enough for two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane didn&#39;t have to be told twice, and soon the two of them were in the shower, soaping each other up, though they resisted the urge to go at it a fourth time, barely, since both were hard as rocks when they got out of the shower and toweled off. Luke got dressed in a fresh work outfit, while Shane pulled on his jeans and undershirt from yesterday, just grabbing his work polo and underwear. The first he wasn&#39;t going to wear if not going to work, the later were, well, not fit for wearing anymore. Shane only paused when they got to the truck to pull out a spare t-shirt he kept in there to swap out for his undershirt.<br />
<br />
The ride to the restaurant was quiet, other than Luke giving him directions again on how to get back. Once he parked though, Luke pulled Shane in for an impromptu make out session that left Shane&#39;s cock straining at his jeans before hopping out of the car. &quot;I&#39;ll text you later. Maybe if we&#39;re both free we could hang out again.&quot; But Luke didn&#39;t wait for a response, and headed off to get inside as Shane sat there staring after him.<br />
<br />
For the first time Shane had a little pang of guilt for manipulating people like he was. But Luke seemed genuinely happy, in fact everyone he changed seemed happier about it in the end. If he kept to that, it&#39;d be fine, right? Shane rubbed at his jaw and tried not to think about it anymore, instead heading over to Pete&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Texting Pete as soon as he arrived, his friend greeted him at the door. &quot;Parents are out for the day so we got the place to ourselves.&quot; Which was basically Pete&#39;s way of saying they were able to hang out in the living room rather than having to stick to Pete&#39;s room, though Shane couldn&#39;t help but feel Pete was acting a bit strangely, which culminated with his friend bursting out with a, &quot;How&#39;d you do it?&quot; When they reached the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot; Shane asked with genuine confusion.<br />
<br />
In answer, Pete pulled up his shirt and pointed at his chest. &quot;This.&quot; Then grabbed his cock. &quot;And this. Don&#39;t lie.. I know it was you. You were watching me while it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane felt like kicking himself. &quot;Fuck. I thought I messed something up. You shouldn&#39;t remember being changed.&quot; At Pete&#39;s hurt look he sighed and sat down. &quot;Sorry, I should have..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Asked.&quot; Pete interrupted. &quot;I mean, at least you didn&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t have done myself. Actually, I would have killed for the bigger dick and some body hair. Guess it helps my best friend wouldn&#39;t screw me over. Well, except the being attracted to guys thing. Wouldn&#39;t have picked that for myself, but I&#39;m kind of enjoying it. So why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane looked guilty. &quot;I.. wanted to mess around. I don&#39;t know why. Are you angry about the uh.. blow job?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete shook his head. &quot;Nah. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t have done it until you fucked with me, but I offered to do it, not like you.. you didn&#39;t force me did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane shook his head. &quot;Only made you bi. So you&#39;re not mad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m kinda pissed you just didn&#39;t tell me and ask.&quot; That actually seemed to ease something in Pete. &quot;So how do you do it? How much can you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a computer program I have, there&#39;s an app on my phone, too.&quot; Shane pulled out his phone. &quot;There&#39;s a lot, it&#39;s mostly focused on physical changes but there&#39;s psychological ones, too. I can make the world alter to fit the changes, or not. I can make it so people notice their own changes or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t believe it if I wasn&#39;t living it. Show me how it works.&quot; Pete&#39;s eye fixed on the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;On who? And how?&quot; Shane moved over to sit next to Pete so his friend could see the screen as his friend was thinking about it. Then he looked out the window and pointed next door. Shane had been over to Pete&#39;s enough in his memories to know who Pete was pointing at. Stoner Steve was the son of Pete&#39;s neighbors, he pretty much lived on his parents dime and did nothing. Well, he didn&#39;t go to school or have a job, in fact he was just lounging by the pool, joint in hand.<br />
<br />
A few years older than Pete and Shane, Steve had never even gone to school with him, but almost everyone in the school knew him as a source of pot for parties. He was tall and lanky, his hair was a long brown mess that he kept tied back. At the moment he was wearing just a speedo, probably trying to work on his tan, it left the very cheap, and very bad tattoos that covered his right arm visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to waste your favor on him?&quot; Shane asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pshh.. no.&quot; Pete answered as he shook his head. &quot;I have something else in mind for the favor, this is just you showing me how it works as an apology for not talking with me before changing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane sighed and nodded, bringing up Stoner Steve&#39;s stats:<br />
<br />
Name: Steven Rollins<br />
Age: 24<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 6&#39;3&quot;<br />
Weight 155lbs<br />
Build: Skinny<br />
Hairiness: Somewhat light (Shaved)<br />
Status: Dating (Marianne Lewis), Dating (Cindy Yates), Dating (Melissa Laine)<br />
Sexual Preference: Heterosexual<br />
Penis size: 5.5&quot; soft, 7&quot; erect<br />
Occupation: Pot dealer<br />
<br />
Pete looked over the stats as they appeared. &quot;Dating three girls at once? Well, I figured he was kind of sleazy, but still. So you just change things in here and it happens?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane nodded. &quot;Basically. First, I&#39;m going to set the world to alter around him, then make it so only you and I will remember.&quot; He looked at the screen and squinted. &quot;Wait, he&#39;s dating your sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete made a disgusted face. &quot;And cheating on her, apparently.&quot; He looked at Shane. &quot;Can you leave it so he remembers, and punish him somehow?&quot; Shane rubbed the back of his neck, unsure at first, but then nodded his agreement. He began to make edits to the profile, with Pete offering his input. &quot;Make him gay..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay isn&#39;t a punishment.&quot; Shane said, giving Pete a wilting stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that, but he&#39;s a bit of a homophobe, trust me, knowing him he&#39;ll see it as one.&quot; Pete nudged Shane. &quot;And make that..&quot; Pete stuck out his pinky finger. Shane insisted on not making everything terrible, and giving him some chance to make something of his life, so they settled for making him younger and sending him back to college. Finally after a few moments they had the profile ready to go:<br />
<br />
Name: Steven Rollins<br />
Age: 20<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;3&quot;<br />
Weight 135lbs<br />
Build: Lean<br />
Hairiness: Moderate<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexual Preference: Homosexual (Bottom)<br />
Penis size: 1.5&quot; soft, 3&quot; erect<br />
Occupation: College student (Major: Dance & Theater)<br />
<br />
Shane let Pete do the honors. &quot;He might run off once he noticed the changes happening.&quot; Shane commented as Pete clicked the button. &quot;I&#39;ve never let the person notice before, well, on purpose. I don&#39;t know how he&#39;ll react.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter, as long as we see enough to know it&#39;s doing it&#39;s thing.&quot; Pete shifted so they could both look out the window into the neighbor&#39;s yard.<br />
<br />
Steve was shifting uncomfortably in his lounge chair. Shane could see why, it looked like the Chronivac was starting with the two things they had given him, a bit more muscle and hair. Steve apparently shaved himself clean, but that hair was now growing back in, and thicker than before, and Steve noticed. He was staring down at his torso as his chest and stomach suddenly sprouted first a stubbly coating of brown hair that grew out into fluffy curls of hair across the middle of his chest and in a line down into his speedo. He was mouthing something that looked like &#39;What the fuck?&#39; He was staring at his own forearm, running his fingers along the suddenly slightly thicker covering.<br />
<br />
The joint in Steve&#39;s hand got a dubious look, then was dropped to the ground. He pulled his speedo out to look at this pubes, and made a disgusted face and the curly brown bush he found waiting for him. So engrossed and seemingly disgusted by his hair growth, he didn&#39;t notice his skinny, bony frame suddenly putting on a bit of muscle.  He&#39;d never compete with Shane or Pete, not even close, but his chest developed a slight curve, and Shane could make out the muscles of his stomach even from here. Despite the faces Steve was making at it, the body hair covering him wasn&#39;t thick. It covered a good part of the front of his torso, but not enough to hide anything beneath it.<br />
<br />
Steve finally did notice the muscle growth, running his hands along his torso, seemingly more pleased with this development. That is until he suddenly lost a foot in height, making him even shorter than Shane. He stayed pretty proportional, and without something to compare him to, pinning his height down would be hard, but watching him go from 6&#39;3&quot; to 5&#39;3&quot; in a few seconds was enough to get Pete to laugh.<br />
<br />
Shane punched him in the arm. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t forget this short guy can kick your ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete wrapped an arm around his friend&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Yeah, but that dick head liked being tall.&quot; In fact, Steve was now freaking out. He had popped up to his feet, as his frame had shrunk with his height, his speedo fell right off of him. He was spinning in a circle, trying to get a look at himself, obviously in a panic. His cock, which was still impressive, even more so on his smaller body was flopping about, rock hard, which was probably to his annoyance.<br />
<br />
And then his cock started to shrink. Steve noticed right away and started grabbing at it, as if tugging it could make the inches stop melting away. But it just kept going until he was left with a rock hard nub smaller than most guys had soft. Not that he was really going to use it in the future. He freaked out and started running towards his house, just as the last two little changes took place. His long hair pulled in to a ultra-stylish spiked front hairstyle, no doubt jelled in place, and the tattoos on his right arm turned into a tattoo sleeve of much higher quality, a cascade of flowers going down his supple limb.<br />
<br />
As Steve disappeared inside the house Pete turned to Shane and nodded. &quot;Well, we&#39;ll see how that goes. Now for my favor, I have someone I want you to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane arched his brow and looked over towards the neighbors house, but Pete shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like that, this is for them. Let me give them a call and bring them over. Trust me, this will be a good thing..&quot; Pete pulled out his phone and went into the other room to make his call, afterwards they sat and chatted as they waited for the person to show up, though Pete refused to answer any questions about them until the doorbell rang and Pete went to answer it. A few moments later, Pete returned with..</p>
