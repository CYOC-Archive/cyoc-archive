<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tracey kept one running to approach her house, before her husband comes back and sees Crystal all alone.  She had to run at a slow pace cause she was carrying quadruplets inside her pregnant tummy.   Almost fifteen minutes later, she finally made it to her house and opened the front door.  When she entered the house, she looked around the place to see if Tom is anywhere inside.  Luckily, he wasn’t in the house yet, so Tracey sighed in relief.  “Thank goodness,” she said, “he’s not home.”  After that search, she then decided to find Crystal and see if she’s O.K.<br />
<br />
After looking around for five minutes, she found baby Crystal asleep on the rug and happily sucking her thumb.  She also found a bunch of toys and what appeared to be remnants of baby food all around her baby daughter.  Tracey shook her head and sighed again.  “Well at least she’s all right.” she said, “But she left quite a mess in the house.”  She scanned the area and saw everything destroyed, her lamp was shattered, pictures were on the floor, magazines were ripped page by page, and baby food she left on the table before she left the house was opened and was splattered all over the sofa and chairs.  At least she didn’t have the smell of dirty diapers or Tracey would’ve changed it as soon as that happens.  Looking at this mess, she lowered her head and shook it.  “I’ve been gone for an hour and the house is a complete mess.  I should’ve kept her in the crib if I had time.  If she was older, she wouldn’t cause this much of a mess.”<br />
<br />
And then it hit her.  Crystal would behave much better if she grew a little older.  She will be much more responsible then now.  She was going to use her laptop to fix that but then she realized she didn’t have it in her hand.  “Oh shoot!  Don’t tell me that I forgot my laptop?” she asked herself as she tried to figure out what happened to it.  She remembered having it with her when she went into Ann’s house and…  “Great…  I can’t believe I left my laptop at Ann’s house.  Now what am I to do?  Can’t get back to the house to retrieve my laptop cause Tom would be here soon.”  Tracey thought about it for a moment until she remembers that she still has the Reality program up in the master bedroom.  “Oh of course!  How could I forget?” she said as she slapped herself on the forehead.  “I’ll worry about getting my laptop another time.  I mean it’s not like someone else is going be in the house right?”  So she left the living room and headed upstairs to reach the main bedroom.<br />
<br />
When she reached the bedroom, she saw the computer still on and had the program still activated.  She shook her head when she forgot to turn the program off and shutdown the computer when she was away.  But at least on the bright side, Tracey won’t have to wait until she sets everything up.  So she sat on the chair and scrolled the mouse pointer to a sleeping Crystal.  Once the little menu appeared and she clicked on the age button, she pondered what age should Crystal would be.  Then she came up with one.  “Maybe five would be a perfect option for her.” she said, “I mean, she would be old enough to learn some responsibility.”  She typed down five and clicked on the enter key to watch the process starting.  But instead of waiting for the change to complete, she left the room and headed down stairs to see if changes would be complete when she gets there.<br />
<br />
Back downstairs, Crystal was sleeping peacefully unaware that the changes were taking place.  She grew out of babyhood, to toddler hood, to childhood as she quickly approached five.  Her height increased in a matter of minutes as her arms and legs increased in size.  All the baby fat that she has begins to dissolves away on her body while her tummy pushed inward into her body.  Her light brunet hair grew out of her head and covered it in seconds and her face looked childish then babyish.  Her diaper turned into training pants, then into a pair of white panties and a pink pajama dress appeared over her.  In minutes she went from being a couple of months old baby to a five-year-old girl.<br />
<br />
When Crystal was done with the change, Tracey walked downstairs to approach her and saw her still laying on the floor with her thumb in her mouth.  Giving out a disgruntle sigh seeing her daughter like that, she tapped Crystal’s body with her foot and woke her up.  “Wake up sleepy head,” said Tracey with a soothing voice, “Time to get up.”  Crystal slowly moaned when she opened her eyes to see her surroundings.  When she sat up on the rug, she looked around and then looked at her mom a little confused.  “Mom?” she said in a childish voice, “What happened?”  “You’ve been sleeping silly.” Melissa answered, “And it looks like you made a mess of things in the house.”  Upon hearing what her mother said, Crystal looked around and saw the living a complete wreck.  “How did I do all that?” she asked in shock.  Since the unaware toggle is on, little Crystal has no memories of what happened to the living room when she was a baby.  Tracey smiled a little and said, “It doesn’t matter Crystal.  Just clean it up and you’ll get some sleep when you’re done.  I don’t want your father to be mad about all this.”  Crystal looked back at her mother and said, “Okay.”<br />
<br />
So during the course of the next fifteen minutes, Crystal picked up her toys, cleaned off all the baby food on the table, and threw scraps of paper she ripped in the garbage.  Though she was cleaning up all this up, her mother insist that she leaves the rest of the mess to her cause she thinks it’s too dangerous for her little daughter.<br />
<br />
Once everything was taken care of, Tracey to Crystal upstairs and went into her daughter’s bedroom.  When they entered, the place that used to be the nursery for Crystal and all the other babies that were once adults was now a little girl’s room.  The crib is turned into a bed with cartoon character blankets on it, a poster of Curious George on one of the walls, and small desk on the right side, and a toy chest resting in between.  “Well Crystal,” Tracey said, “time to go to bed.”  “Yes mommy.” said Crystal as she ran to the bed and jumped on it.  While she was resting on the pillow, Tracey approached her and wrapped the blanket on top of her to make her daughter feel warm.  But before she could leave, Crystal wanted to ask her something.  “Mommy?”  Tracey turned around to see her daughter and wondered what she wants.  So she asked, “What is it hon?”  “My daddy told me that you are going to have four babies at the same time.  Is it true?”<br />
<br />
Tracey forgotten that the unaware toggle makes everyone’s memories rearranges themselves to match what’s happening around them.  So when she put both Ann and Bryan into her stomach with Janet and Sarah, reality around her changed.  So people would think that that she’s pregnant with quadruplets.  Thinking that there’s no way in getting out of it this time, Tracey silently sighed and answered her daughter’s question.  “Why of course it’s true dear.  You see, mommy and daddy loved each other so much that we want to have four babies in the family.  It was a hard decision for the two of us, but we didn’t choose it, we wanted it.”  “You think it’s going to hard to take care of all four babies in one day?” asked Crystal.  “I don’t know about that.”  Tracey answered, “But what I know is that we’re take good care of them long as we could.  And maybe you can help us take care of them as well and play with them to make them feel comfortable.  Think you can handle something like that?”  Crystal nodded and answered “Yep.  I promise, I’ll take of each of them with all my heart.”  “That’s good to hear.”<br />
<br />
There was a bit of silence between the two until Crystal said one more thing.  “Um…  Mom?”  Tracey looked at Crystal and wondered what she wants this time.  “Yes sweetie.”  “I was wondering…” Crystal stopped when she tried to figure out how to say it.  “Can I feel them?”  Tracey blinked when she heard that from her daughter but decided to let her feel them.  “Sure thing hon.”<br />
<br />
Crystal got up from her bed and started rubbing her mother’s stomach.  After a few seconds of rubbing, he felt a kick in the stomach that surprised her.  “What is it Crystal?”  Tracey’s daughter looked up at her mother and smiled.  “I could feel one of the babies inside you mommy.” she said with a gleam in her eyes.  Tracey smiled back when she heard that and looked down to rub her own stomach.  “I can’t wait to see the babies mommy.” Crystal said.  “Me too dear,” Tracey responded, “Me too.”  Quickly, Crystal went back to bed and closed her eyes.  “Goodnight mommy!”  “Goodnight Crystal.” Tracey said as she bent down and kissed her daughter on the cheek, “Sweet dreams.”  As soon as Crystal fell asleep, Tracey left the bedroom, closed the door, and headed downstairs to clean up the rest of the mess and waited for her husband to come.</p>
