<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey,&quot; Donovan stepped inside his house. &quot;Was there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. Nothing came today,&quot; Jackson quickly said. He had his duffle bag over his shoulder and already headed for the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I got an email that it was delivered...&quot; Donovan continued.<br />
<br />
Jackson&#39;s hand was already on the doorknob again. &quot;Nope nothing,&quot; he repeated a bit faster than he should have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Donovan turned back to his jock of a son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Jackson said. He was practically hanging off the thing. &quot;I&#39;m heading over to Nick&#39;s for a bit. That alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Yeah...&quot; Donovan nodded. Something felt a bit off, but he couldn&#39;t quite place where the feeling was coming from. He knew Nick and Jackson were pretty good friends, but each time he really tried to focus on it, his mind seemed to go a bit fuzzy. <br />
<br />
Jackson shut the door with a &#39;thanks,&#39; leaving Donovan to himself. &quot;Ray said they were really reliable. Guess I&#39;ll have to go to the website and see.&quot; He booted it up on the computer and was happy to see a link that would direct him to products stolen. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he clicked on it and typed in his details. Barely even another question was asked before it declared another package was to be shipped. This time it had to be signed for, but that wasn&#39;t much of an issue as it would be arriving in the hour. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is too crazy...&quot; Donovan muttered to himself as he leaned back in his computer chair. He&#39;d never thought of himself as being behind the times, but this was just so different. Computers had been a luxury when he was growing up, the internet was just a bunch of weirdo blogs and shopping was still done in stores. But now they could have a package shipped in less than a day? It seemed too much for him to really handle.<br />
<br />
Donovan took a second to pat his belly. &quot;Guess that just happens to everyone,&quot; he pondered. Never in his life did he think he&#39;d get this big. Even if he wasn&#39;t all that tall, he&#39;d at least been muscular. A thin waist and wide shoulders gave him a very masculine look. Even if he didn&#39;t have all those cut muscles the guys have in those superhero movies or magazines, he never thought of himself as weak. Though, looking at Jackson&#39;s buff body, he couldn&#39;t help but admit a bit of envy as well. Jackson had to have all kinds of women flocking to him. If only he&#39;d take an interest in them as well. <br />
<br />
The doorbell brought Donovan out of his haze. He went up and saw a man holding a package and clipboard. &quot;Sign here please,&quot; the man said. Donovan did as he was told, took the box and thanked him. &quot;Just doing my job. And if you have any problems don&#39;t hesitate to call the help hotline.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Donovan said again as he closed the door. He set the package on the dining room table and got out a pair of scissors. However, a mix of confusion and anger grew inside him as he pulled out an already opened box of drawing pencils and pens. For one, he knew it wasn&#39;t a present for Jackson. The guy barely used pencils to do his homework, let alone draw. And for two, the package looked like it had already been torn asunder. Even the sticker saying, &#39;Perfect for College Students&#39; was almost completely ripped off. &quot;What the hell man?&quot; Donovan threw them onto the table and pulled out his phone.<br />
<br />
His anger only grew as he was greeted with smooth, lofi, royalty free jazz. &quot;Mother fuckers...&quot; he cursed. &quot;Last time I take a recommendation from Ray.&quot; For the next minute or two he paced back and forth in his house. He could feel his blood pressure rising with each pass in the living room. &quot;Calm... You need to stay calm,&quot; he reminded himself. Raising your voice rarely ever got you good customer service. Even if you got what you wanted it would usually end up only having the lowest amount of compliance you could possibly get. <br />
<br />
Donovan took a seat and set his phone to speaker mode. The music continued with consistent reminders that his business is greatly appreciated and as soon as the next available consultant is available his problems will be resolved. He tapped his fingers knowing full well how full of shit the automated messages were. In his boredom, his eyes traveled back to the pens and pencils. &#39;They were already open,&#39; he reasoned as he pulled out one of them. Then a sticky note to start doodling on.<br />
<br />
It was surprisingly calming. Just feeling his wrist rotate and draw a more and more perfect circle. He tore the sticky note off and then started on the next page. His boiling anger turned back into a simmer. Then nearly nothing at all. Instead, there was a different desire. He couldn&#39;t quite explain it, but he went to the printer and pulled out a larger piece of paper. It was almost like a flash of genius. He could feel like his circles were being drawn more precisely and in specific locations. But then he started to connect them.<br />
<br />
Donovan didn&#39;t dare stop himself. If anything, he was feeling better than he had all day. His heart was racing, but it was more out of excitement than anger. With each line he felt more determined to finish. In his trance he didn&#39;t notice the grease and grime from the day started to wash off of his body. Almost like it had never been there in the first place. Years of his life were starting to rewind as his tanned skin as rough as hide from working outside all day was starting to soften. The dark hair running up and down his burly arms and legs receded back into his body. While the thick beard around his jaw pulled in but then remerged on top of his head. Instead of dark brown hairs, they were soft blond ones that grew a bit longer than he&#39;d normally have.<br />
<br />
Donny brushed his bangs out of his face as he continued to draw the image. It was growing more clear; it was a man. A very muscular man. The smile on his face only broadened. The man looked so familiar, but he couldn&#39;t quite place it. But he knew it was someone unlike him. His thick burly arms were rapidly receding into nothing. The muscle and fat that had been grown from years of heavy lifting and poor eating habits disappeared. He had to readjust his position as his thick belly pulled back into his stomach. What had been nearly 45-inch waist was now barely even 30. His little butt wiggled as he thought more and more about the big muscular man he was drawing. <br />
<br />
He made sure to add on the wrestling singlet that clung to his strong torso. But then looked between his drawing&#39;s legs. &#39;Jackson has such a big dick...&#39; he mused to himself. One of Donny&#39;s free hands went between his legs as he felt his erection. His little body squirmed with excitement and let out an accident, &#39;OOOO,&#39; as his hand padded it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for calling C. C. Helios. How may I help you?&quot; a female voice on the other end of the line asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;EEEP!&quot; Donny squealed as he nearly fell out of his chair and fumbled with his phone. &quot;Sorry! Sorry!&quot; he apologized as he tried to get the phone to his ear. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite alright sir,&quot; the woman&#39;s tone didn&#39;t falter. &quot;What seems to be the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... One second,&quot; Donny said as he took a breath. &quot;I wanted to buy a present for my friend Jackson. But then he said the order never came in so I had you guys redeliver it. Then when I got the box, it was a bunch of drawing utensils. It&#39;s just I don&#39;t understand why these were sent. Because it&#39;s more like they&#39;re for me instead of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; the woman paused. &quot;Let me take a look. Do you have your order number?&quot; Donny gave it to her and she pulled it up. &quot;Well... That seems to be the only thing that you have in your cart. Were you perhaps looking at them and added them to your cart and forgot to add your friend&#39;s present?&quot;<br />
<br />
Donny took a second to think. He could remember specifically looking at them as they were great for his college art projects. Something about the memory seemed to be missing, but he couldn&#39;t figure out what. &quot;Maybe...&quot; he admitted. <br />
<br />
The woman gave a pleasant, almost knowing laugh. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a problem I can fix. But if you go through our website and try to purchase a present for your freind, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be 100% satisfied.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Donny nodded, realizing how stupid he was for wasting this person&#39;s time.<br />
<br />
&quot;But was there anything else that I could help you with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Donny looked back at the damaged packaging. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know. Maybe. It&#39;s kind of stupid. But the packaging it came in was really badly damaged. I know you can&#39;t do anything about it. But I don&#39;t know. Never mind. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. That would be a problem,&quot; the woman said. &quot;We don&#39;t want our customers to be anything but satisfied. How about I send you something free along with the item that you want to order for your friend. I&#39;ll send the promocode for your item to your email.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really!? Thank you!&quot; Donny smiled. &quot;That&#39;d be so great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a problem at all. Here at C. C. Helios we take pride in saying our customers have 100% satisfaction.&quot;<br />
<br />
Donny thanked here again and then hung up. Within a few minutes he saw the code in his email. &quot;So easy,&quot; he mused to himself, tapping the drawing pencil against the paper. &quot;Jackson...&quot; he smiled down at the drawing looking at the hunky wrestler in his singlet. Though, he didn&#39;t realize just how big he&#39;d drawn the other man&#39;s dick and balls. There would have been no way for him to hide that monster if it was actually that big. <br />
<br />
For a second, he thought about erasing it. Then decided it would just go into his private collection. After putting it away, Donny booted up the website again and made sure to buy his friend a gift this time.</p>
