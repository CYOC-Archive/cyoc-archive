<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wondering what life she wants, Janet decided what she wanted to be. Like most girls, she had always looked at fashion magazines and the like, and admired the beautiful women featured in them. They were supermodels: almost impossibly beautiful women. She always wished she was that gorgeous...and with this amulet she could be!  But there was one other problem she wanted to clear up.  Most fashion models due tend to focus on their bodies more then their brains, so they are not as smart as they look.  She should know, she watched Zoolander a while back and could tell that looks don’t get you a college degree.  So besides having a hot body, why not be highly intellectual as well.  It could be the best of both worlds.  She imagined her ideal supermodel, incredibly beautiful, extremely intelligent, and possessing a very kind heart. The amulet shone bright, and she knew her newest transformation would begin!<br />
<br />
Janet felt the changes flow through her. Turning to her mirror, the changes were pretty typical. Her breasts increased in size slightly, while her shirt began to crawl up her chest. Her skirt became much shorter, as did her long socks. Her hair changed color slightly and grew in length as well.  She looked the same, more or less, but soon she will have a hot body and smart mind to match<br />
<br />
As Janet&#39;s changes continued, her shirt and socks disappeared, revealing her girly panties. She grew a little bit taller, while her skin seemed to tan a little bit.  Her hair grew out longer than before, now reaching the middle of her back. Her hair also took on an orangish tint. She felt a bit uncomfortable being so under dressed. However, the reason why she’s a little naked is because she was becoming a swimsuit model.  After all, swimsuit models do get the money.  Seems to make she felt less embarrassed than her normal shy self would have felt...<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation continued as her body grew and matured to a completely different person. Her body tanned further, looking incredibly beautiful. It seemed all-natural, though she felt like she did spend a lot of time at the beach. Her eyes became a brilliant green while they looked immensely beautiful as well. Her hair changed styles, becoming more delicate and curly. She also grew taller once again. Meanwhile, her breasts still seemed to be growing. Seeing herself in the mirror she felt strange. It was odd, looking at someone so...beautiful in the mirror.<br />
<br />
The changes in Janet went further while she admired her look. Her body felt far stronger than before, gaining powerful muscles. They didn&#39;t make her seem muscle-bound or manly though, they only added to her beauty. Her breasts grew to nearly massive proportions. Her curly hair now looked kind of a like a bright red color, giving her a beautiful yet kind of mysterious look. Her panties disappeared, replaced with an intricate (and very skimpy) bikini bottom. She was honestly shocked now! Seeing herself this naked felt odd...but the weirdest part was that it wasn&#39;t freaking her out as much. She felt oddly comfortable with so little clothing on. Her mind must have been adjusting...  But then, there was a different change in her mind too, almost feeling smarter as homework she had makes it really simple.  She could even pass high school and move on to college at a young age.<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation was now nearly complete, as a few things need to be altered. Her hair darkened, becoming a cool and incredibly beautiful dark red color. She sighed in relief as the red top to her new swimwear appeared. She had to admit, she looked incredible in it. Memories began to flow in. She was a supermodel, but a highly intelligent one. She studied Industrial Engineering in college but due to her looks took on a job as Supermodel. On the side she&#39;s continuing her education, hoping to gain a P.H.D. in her field. Her employer’s lover her amazing looks as well as intense dedication. And soon...she had another shoot to go to!<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation was now complete. Her hair grew out longer, now delicately emphasizing her incredible curves. A small white rose, a signature of all her pictures, appeared in her hair. Most of the changes weren&#39;t to her physical body...it was to her attitude. Confidence swelled within Janet. She knew how beautiful she was, how effortlessly she could do her supermodel job. She understood how effective she would be as an engineer as well. Despite her pride, she was far from a cruel person. She spends much of her free time improving the self-esteem of women everywhere. While not everyone could be a super model, everyone could be comfortable in his or her body, and she helped girls realize that looks aren&#39;t everything.  Not only that, but she becomes a role model for younger girls as well.  With her high intelligence, she can prove to the girls that a hot body isn’t enough for the future.  If you study hard enough, you can conquer anything.<br />
<br />
The world around her made an immediate change as her room altered.  Now she was in a private dressing room with a vanity makeup counter, a mirror, and a rack filled with swimsuits and robes.  Obviously they are for a summer collection.  On the wall is a schedule that not only has photo shoots and walkways, but also classes in college she needs to attend in between.  On the top of the schedule, it reads, ‘Jennifer’s Weekly Schedule’.  Seeing this, Janet, now Jennifer, is going to enjoy this new life to the fullest.  There was a knock on the door as someone called out, “Jenny, photo shot starts in five minutes.  Get ready!”  Jennifer turned to the door and said, “Okay!  On my way!”  Getting to the door, she smiled and was prepared for her new life as an intelligent super model.</p>
