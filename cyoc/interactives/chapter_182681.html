<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After finishing her share of the fast food, Miranda elected to stay in the common room and watch some TV as her other roommates went about their business. After several minutes of relaxation however, she started getting an uncomfortable feeling in her hips and legs, like the pins and needles feeling you get after sitting on your foot but over her entire lower body. When the sensation didn&#39;t go away after another few minutes she got a bit worried. When she stood up she found herself stumbling forwards, her legs barely able to hold her weight. She managed to catch herself on the wall of the common room and propped herself up on her numbed legs. At this point she was really worried that something serious was happening to her and that she needed to get help. She knew that Samantha was in her room studying and that if she called the other woman would most likely hear her, but she didn&#39;t want to interrupt the other woman with something she wouldn&#39;t be able to help with. Thinking of people who might know what was happening to her she remembered that a few doors down was someone working on getting her medical degree. Surely they would know what was wrong with her!<br />
<br />
Miranda awkwardly opened the door to the hallway and made her way to the medical students door, giving it a few sharp knocks. The door was opened by a woman with long black hair and light brown skin. Her brown eyes opened wide with shock when she saw the barely standing woman at her door.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re a med student right? My legs have gone almost completely numb and I was hoping you could help me figure out what&#39;s going on.”<br />
<br />
Too stunned to argue, the woman simply nodded and helped bring Miranda into her room, guiding her to the couch in the common room to sit down. Once she had a moment to compose herself she gave a stern look to Miranda and said<br />
<br />
&quot;Why was your first thought to come here, instead of calling an ambulance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want to have one come all the way here only for it to turn out to be something small…&quot; <br />
<br />
Rolling her eyes at the weak response, the other woman decided to humour Miranda for now and call 911 if it turns out to be something serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, my name is Kaia, what&#39;s yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK Miranda, describe your symptoms in as much detail as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Miranda had finished retelling her day, Kaia spent a bit of time fiddling with her laptop, before turning back to her patient.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, based on what you&#39;ve told me there are a few things I think it could be, but in order to be sure I would need to do some simple tests. Would you be alright with me taking off your pants so I can examine your legs more thoroughly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda was a bit embarrassed about having someone take off her pants, especially an attractive woman like Kaia, but her numbness had worsened since arriving in the med students room, meaning it would be incredibly difficult to do on her own.<br />
<br />
Once Miranda had given her consent, Kaia carefully and professionally removed her patient&#39;s pants, placing them on the nearby table. She then spent the next few minutes doing simple tests on Miranda&#39;s legs, rubbing, tapping, and squeezing various parts of them in an attempt to find the problem.<br />
<br />
Miranda meanwhile, despite the fact that she was no longer able to move her legs at all, could feel bursts of arousal wherever Kaia made contact, causing her to blush and turn away. Her blush deepened when Kaia put Miranda&#39;s legs on her shoulders and reached around to Miranda&#39;s back &quot;to check for any spinal issues&quot;. <br />
<br />
Kaia felt over Miranda&#39;s spine, checking if she could feel anything abnormal. When she went to pull her hands away however, she found that they were stuck. When she then attempted to pull herself away completely, she found that Miranda&#39;s legs were also stuck to her back. Alerted by Kaia&#39;s pulling, Miranda glanced back over, shocked by what she saw. Her legs had begun to sink into the med students back, causing Miranda to let out a scream. After several seconds of both women desperately trying to pull themselves apart, Kaia&#39;s arms had been almost completely absorbed into Miranda&#39;s back and thighs. As her arms continued to sink into Miranda&#39;s body, Kaia found her face being pressed into the other woman&#39;s crotch, the red panties covering Miranda&#39;s private parts muffling her cries of distress. <br />
<br />
Miranda&#39;s terror at the horrific situation began to be replaced by the sensation of having Kaia&#39;s face pressed into her crotch. These feelings only grew stronger when her panties fused with her skin, becoming a layer of smooth inhuman skin covering her crotch. With the other woman&#39;s face now directly touching her incredibly sensitive vagina, Miranda&#39;s reluctant whimpers turned into moans or pleasure as the terror at what was happening to Kaia was completely overwritten. The red skin slowly began to spread across the two women&#39;s merging bodies, enveloping Kaia&#39;s upper torso in a crimson tube of flesh and removing any remaining distinction between their forms. The tube continued to engulf Kaia, enveloping her body all the way do to her still flailing legs. Once Kaia&#39;s form was completely subsumed, the tube began to take on more distinct features, large spots of darker shades began to dapple the skin as the tube changed shape, flattening and lengthening until it resembled the tail of an eel. The most interesting feature however was a layer of mucus that covered the entire tail from the tip to where the eel skin met with Miranda&#39;s human waist.<br />
<br />
Before Miranda could begin to contemplate what had become of Kaia, she felt a tingling across her human torso. She still wasn&#39;t done transforming. Four arms, two on each side, grew below her original pair. These new limbs began flailing wildly once they finished growing, Miranda unable to control them. When she took a good look at them she realized that the new arms were not copies of her arms, but of Kaia&#39;s. Any thoughts about what this could mean were interrupted by more growths on her body, this time on her chest. Three new breast, each one lacking a nipple, formed on her chest in a single row below her first pair, her human torso stretching slightly in both directions to accommodate them. On each of the breasts, where the nipple would normally been located, things that were nor supposed to be there appeared. On the centre of the trio was a mouth, while the outer two had eyes, eyes the same brown as Kaia&#39;s. Once these strange additions were fully formed, the four new arms slowly stopped their chaotic movements, and a familiar, confused voice broke from between the newly formed lipple.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s going on? Why does my body feel so weird?”<br />
<br />
It took Miranda a lot of effort to figure out how to move on her nearly thirty-foot eel tail, but she managed to clumsily make her way to the communal bathroom so that she and Kaia could examine their new, shared, body. While Miranda had control of most of it, Kaia was in full control of the four extra arms, giving her some agency. While exploring, the two women also found their now shared vagina, nestled down towards the tip of their tail and became sidetrack for an hours bringing themselves to several orgasms, the pair finding that their pleasure was compounded upon itself  by their mutated body.<br />
<br />
Afterwards the conjoined pair retired to Kaia&#39;s bedroom and flopped down on the bed, their eel tail draped around the floor haphazardly as they passed out in seconds, thoroughly exhausted.</p>
