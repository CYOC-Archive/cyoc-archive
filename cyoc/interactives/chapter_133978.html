<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the middle of the night, Luka and her crew left the kingdom of Valarius, although they made a screw up which lead them to be hunted by more than thousands of people, the crew got what they needed, informations about the kingdom, the security measures, etc.<br />
The crew aboarded their airship and went towards the Adam&#39;s kingdom, while flying towards Adam&#39;s kingdom, Anija and Karyu had a discussion.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t feel guilty Karyu, those cultists have sinned for too long, you did a favor by punishing them.&quot; Said Anija, attempting to cheer up Karyu.<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t an angelic dragoness such as you be the one to scold me for my actions?&quot; Asked Karyu, with his eldritch voice absent.<br />
&quot;I should, but the cultists did far more cruel things, you may have caused a minor genocide and the destruction of a city, but the victims of the genocide were all cultists or supporters of their cause, who practiced inhuman rituals and other actions, plus that village was built through the resources of the cultists.&quot; Replied Anija, &quot;I felt the pain they felt, but it wasn&#39;t as detrimental as the emotional pain someone feels when a relative or a close friend dies.&quot; said Anija, this made Karyu smile a little.<br />
&quot;That still dosen&#39;t change the fact that i&#39;m a demonic dragon now.&quot; Said Karyu with a sigh, &quot;I&#39;m basically a sadist now.&quot; finished Karyu as he looked at his demonic paws.<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot; Said Anija, &quot;For example, Apollyon wasn&#39;t a cruel demonic dragon, although he did feed himself through negative human emotions, he helped people through unconventional ways, some of the actions could be considered unethical, but he still saved countless lives.&quot; finished Anija, the two of them continued their discussion.<br />
<br />
Eventually the crew reached Adam&#39;s kingdom, quickly leaving the airship as they went into the castle, to Luka&#39;s and the crew&#39;s suprise, Bartamus was in the throne room speaking with Adam and Elisa, meanwhile his dragon Teach was speaking with Sephira and Hadad, &quot;There they are!&quot; said Elisa cheerfully as she went towards Luka and her crew, only to be followed by Bartamus and Adam.<br />
&quot;I heard what happend in Valarius, me and Elisa are trying our hardest to calm down the situation.&quot; Said Adam, as he crossed his arms speaking with a worried voice.<br />
&quot;Until then our true identities will be concealed.&quot; Said Luka as she looked at her brother, who was also staring back at her.<br />
&quot;You all should take a break, i have another important mission.&quot; Said Adam, &quot;If you succeed it then the time taken for your bounties to disappear will be extremly reduced.&quot; finished Adam.<br />
&quot;Let me guess, you&#39;re gonna send us to assassinate the king of Valarius.&quot; Said Karyu, as he crossed his forepaws.<br />
&quot;You are correct.&quot; Replied Adam with a smile.<br />
&quot;Well, then i guess we will take some rest, we barelly took any form of rest while in Valarius.&quot; Said Avelia as she stretched, only to then yawn.<br />
<br />
Most of the crew fell asleep within the castle, the only ones to be awake were Bartamus and his little sister, Luka, who were in the nursery.<br />
&quot;They&#39;re so beautiful.&quot; Said Bartamus as he looked at Luka&#39;s children, &quot;Did you seriously change your gender and mate your dragon for this?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Replied Luka, &quot;Mating Karyu and giving birth did hurt, but the results were worth it.&quot; said Luka, as she held both of her children like a mother would.<br />
Bartamus smiled a little, wondering if he should do the same with his dragon Teach, &quot;Is there a problem with the fact that i&#39;m now a she?&quot; asked Luka as she raised her eyebrow in a cute manner.<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re actually really beautiful as a she.&quot; Replied Bartamus, &quot;But i will admit that i was thinking about doing the same with my dragon.&quot; confessed Bartamus, this made Luka&#39;s eyes go wide for a second, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Bartamus.<br />
&quot;First i have my affair with Karyu, then Vaestro recently had a session with his dragoness and now you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re thinking if you should switch your gender and have a session with your dragon.&quot; Said Luka, she was replied by a laugh from Bartamus, &quot;Love&#39;s in the air i guess.&quot; said Bartamus as he looked at the two baby Kinins.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Karyu and Teach spent some time together while their riders were in the nursery.<br />
&quot;So, how does it feel being like that?&quot; Asked Teach as he looked at Karyu&#39;s frightening yet adorable form.<br />
&quot;It feels weird.&quot; Replied Karyu with an eldritch voice, this made Teach back away a little, &quot;Sorry, i don&#39;t know how to control my voice.&quot; said Karyu as he gave a frustrated growl.<br />
&quot;I have to admit, you look much better like this.&quot; Said Teach, &quot;Anyways, putting the compliments aside,&quot; started Teach, &quot;how did it feel fucking your rider?&quot; finally asked Teach, this sudden personal question made him blush.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a personal question...&quot; Said Karyu as the black scales of his visage made red hue due to embarrassment, &quot;But you technically are my brother, so i guess i can say it.&quot; finished Karyu as he took a deep breath, &quot;It honestly felt better than mating a dragoness.&quot; said Karyu.<br />
Teach chuckled as he heard his brother&#39;s confession, &quot;Well i guess i will need to find a chick who is willing to let me mount her!&quot; said Teach with a laugh.<br />
&quot;Or...&quot; Started Karyu, &quot;You could wait for your rider to switch genders, so you two might have strong Kinins.&quot; said Karyu with a cheeky smile, Teach saw multiple Kinins in his life, he admited that he was amazed seeing how strong the Kinins were, but the idea for his rider to switch genders and have a romantic session with him almost sounded impossible, this didn&#39;t stop Teach&#39;s imagination to be filled with ideas on how Bartamus would look like as a female.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
The next day, the crew returned to Valarius, with their new identities.<br />
Luka switched her identity to a woman named Folka, a woman with bronze colored hair and brown eyes, meanwhile her brother, Bartamus, switched his identity to a man named Auralius, a man with much darker bronze hair and the same brown eyes as his sister.<br />
Vaestro switched his identity to a man named Ludvig, a man with shoulder length golden hair and azure eyes, Avelia, now known as Bertha, had the same hair color and eye color as Vaestro.<br />
<br />
Their mission was to join a royal banquet and assassinate the king of Valarius, who put the bounties on the heads of the crew, thanks to Adam, Elisa and some of the members of Bartamus&#39; crew, the crew had fake identification documents and invitations to the banquet, so they entered it without any problem, and if that wasn&#39;t enough, most of the assistants and guards were on Bartamus&#39; side, greatly outnumbring the king&#39;s official guards, the assistants were ready to poison the food of the king, meanwhile the guards were ready to hold the entire place hostage, some of the dragons and corsairs of Baramus&#39; crew also remained at a safe distance, ready to ambush any reinforcements who wished to take the life of their commander and friends.<br />
<br />
The dragons who were disguised as horses waited for their riders at the stalls, Vrackie and Anija, who were disguised as two snow white mares casted two spells that didn&#39;t require them to be dragons to be casted, which allowed them to see through the eyes of their riders and to communicate with them through a spiritual link created by Anija.<br />
<br />
Now, the mission was impossible to fail, Bartamus&#39; crew was one of the most powerful and dangerous corsairs with an almost unlimited number and with the strongest resources.<br />
<br />
And the death of the king has multiple options, the question is, which one was it?</p>
