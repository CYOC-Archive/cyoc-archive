<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After dinner Moe and Nichole Charleston cleaned up, then went to their bedroom.<br />
Behind the closed door, they sat side by side on the bed while he discussed his plans for reopening Moe&#39;s Pizza in Moon Lake.<br />
Nichole was happy to see the fire in her husband&#39;s eyes again at the prospect of not only getting their lives back to some semblance of &quot;normal&quot; after everything they&#39;ve had to deal with concerning the Gambonis and one man&#39;s obsession with their daughter, provided the word &quot;normal&quot; was even applicable in a town that served as a private sanctuary to anthropomorphic were creatures that most people didn&#39;t think existed outside of the entertainment industry.<br />
&quot;My only real concern is where to acquire the ingredients from,&quot; said Moe, after explaining everything he had planned for the new location, since Nichole was not only his wife, but partner in both life and business. &quot;After all, what if Daniel&#39;s right and the Gambonis have also been tracking us through my obsession with making the perfect pizza?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is one obsession I can live with,&quot; replied Nichole, taking her husband&#39;s hands in hers. &quot;But everything that&#39;s gone wrong in our lives lately <b><i>is</b></i> the Gambonis&#39; fault, not that of anyone within this house, let alone this town. We&#39;ve weathered this storm so far and with the Brooks&#39; help, we&#39;ll get through the rest too.&quot;<br />
Then Nichole paused before repeating her previous position on the subject. &quot;The only thing I don&#39;t like is this MANDATORY were law. I would happily have signed some kind of non-disclosure agreement or whatever documentation the town wanted. Heck. All they had to do was ask and I would have gladly promised to keep their secrets as long as we could stay here and were protected from the Gambonis. But to demand that one of us MUST give up our humanity?&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Moe, lovingly putting an arm around his wife. &quot;And if push came to shove, I would take Karen&#39;s place as the family were if necessary.&quot;<br />
&quot;But then we wouldn&#39;t be able to be together again as a couple,&quot; realized Nichole, while leaning against him.<br />
That was when Moe decided to broach the subject that had been on both of their minds all evening, but had yet to be discussed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless...&quot; he said cautiously, to which Nichole raised her head and looked at him intently.<br />
&quot;You mean, we both join too?&quot;<br />
&quot;The local law says only one of us has to become a were. There&#39;s nothing that says the rest of a family can&#39;t join if they want to.&quot;<br />
That was when Nichole pulled away from him.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying we should, or will. But the more I think about it, the more I understand their position. After all, you couldn&#39;t reveal the secret without putting a member of your own family at risk too,&quot; Moe pointed out to her. &quot;Besides, to hear Daniel talk, becoming a were was the greatest thing that ever happened to him and Fran.&quot;<br />
Then Moe leaned close and whispered in his wife&#39;s ear, &quot;He says their sex life has never been better since they became weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole started to blush, not only at what her husband said, but remembering her thoughts after Fran said something similar to her.<br />
Then she realized, &quot;Karen&#39;s still a virgin! Does this mean—&quot;<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; confirmed Moe. &quot;Yet I&#39;ve heard that weres do take precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancies. They have their own birth control pills and everything.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well. That makes sense,&quot; conceded Nichole. &quot;Otherwise, the world would have been inundated with them years ago, and I do have Karen on birth control to help regulate her periods. But sometimes I feel like I&#39;m in a nightmare and I wish I would wake up soon,&quot; she admitted, leaning against her husband again. &quot;First the Gambonis, now weres.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. Truthfully? Somehow, I&#39;m finding the concept of weres a little more easier to deal with now that we&#39;ve been in Moon Lake for a while than the whole mess with the Gambonis,&quot; revealed Moe.<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked his wife, not bothering to look up at him.<br />
&quot;The whole idea of one man wielding the entire weight and power of a criminal organization just to get someone who doesn&#39;t want him seemed so far fetched to me at the start. Like the plot of a bad TV movie. But now that I&#39;ve actually lived through it, discovering that weres exist somehow seems kind of... minor in comparison.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think I know what you mean. Everything the Gambonis have put us through has been a living hell. Yet, after finding out weres actually exist, what&#39;s next?&quot; asked Nichole. &quot;Discovering the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny are real too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Aw, you can&#39;t fool me. There ain&#39;t no Sanity Clause,&quot; replied Moe, quoting her a line from one of their favorite movies.*<br />
That made Nichole smile, before she raised her head and gave him a long and passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
The couple put their arms around each other.<br />
Each wanted to continue the moment, especially if it led to the ultimate expression of love.<br />
Then Nichole looked at Moe and asked, &quot;Do you want to become a were?&quot;<br />
Moe didn&#39;t hesitate to answer. &quot;If it meant saving you or Karen, in a heart beat. Otherwise, I honestly don&#39;t know. What about you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Like I said, it&#39;s the mandatory part I don&#39;t like about their law. Besides, to give up your humanity to become something else? I&#39;m surprised Karen is so willing to do it,&quot; admitted Nichole.<br />
&quot;Daniel says it&#39;s becoming <i>more</i> than human. Maybe it&#39;s some kind of empowering thing,&quot; surmised her husband. &quot;Weres are supposed to be stronger than humans, and if Karen ever is physically confronted by—&quot;<br />
Moe never got to finish that statement as Nichole shuddered in his arms.<br />
&quot;Can we not talk about him right now?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; agreed Moe, holding Nichole closer for more comfort.<br />
<br />
The couple was silent for a while. Just enjoying each other&#39;s company.<br />
Then Moe finally said, &quot;If, and I&#39;m stressing that word. IF we ever do become weres, we either do it together or not at all.&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; replied Nichole. &quot;And if we ever do, we both become the same kind of were by mutual consent, like Daniel and Fran are the same type.&quot;<br />
Moe agreed, before kissing Nichole again.<br />
Then she smiled at him and said, &quot;But right now, I have all the fur I need right here,&quot; before seductively reaching a hand inside his shirt to caress Moe&#39;s hairy chest.<br />
&quot;Well, I feel the same way about your hair and—&quot; as Moe reached down to start teasing the space between his wife&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
The couple started intimately kissing each other again as they began struggling to remove each other&#39;s clothing without breaking physical contact.<br />
That wasn&#39;t totally possible, but soon the Charleston&#39;s were naked on their bed as Nichole spread her legs open to invite her husband inside.<br />
She shuddered in pleasure, feeling Moe&#39;s hard penis enter her most private depths.<br />
Nichole couldn&#39;t help but feel even more turned on as Moe&#39;s hairy chest caressed the hard nipples of her breasts.<br />
Moe just moaned in pleasure as he urged himself even deeper into his wife, not daring to express the sensation of the hair around his cock intermingling with Nichole&#39;s muff.<br />
Nichole wrapped her legs around her husband, wanting Moe to dive into her harder with each thrust as she arched her back and waist up to meet him. She would not admit, not even to herself, how wet she was as stray thoughts of both herself and Moe as various weres in the photos she saw within Karen&#39;s book turned her on.<br />
Moe felt his hands (claws?) dig into the mattress on either side of his wife as his hard man(?)hood plunged into Nichole.<br />
Neither Charleston would ever acknowledge the moans (howls?) (roars?) of pure pleasure that issued from their throats as they came together as one entity.<br />
<br />
Spent, Moe collapsed on top of Nichole, who welcomed him with open arms.<br />
They laid there together in bed, each holding their mate close as they fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms.<br />
