<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unknown to most people there are a set of laws to time like that of Gravity, the conservation of Mass, or the expending of energy. Time could not be unwound or undone but it could be transferred from one item to another. And so as Jeff created a hole where his father once was by turning John from his father to his younger brother, the universe needed something to take up the time that was being stripped from John in exchange and fill the void in the family Jeff and John were creating by this action. As it happened, Jeff already had a younger brother, Joey. Joey was a toddler of four and an irritating pain as far as Jeff was concerned--too young to really be much of a brother with as of yet. As far as the Chronivac was concerned, he was perfect for taking on the amount of time that John was voluntarily losing and filling the parental void that John had vacated. So, Joey, who had been coaxed down for a nap along with her in her bedroom by Jeff&#39;s mother, began to age as John grew younger. <br />
<br />
Joey&#39;s young pudgy toddler body soon began to grow larger, the baby fat beginning to become more evenly distributed as arms, legs, hands, and feet grew longer, larger, and bigger. Since John had not had his clothes change with him as he had aged, neither did Joey&#39;s clothes change with him either, and so his pajamas began quickly to strain and stretch, his pull-ups bursting along with his pajamas as he moved more firmly into childhood and outgrew them. All the while Jeff&#39;s Mom, Cheryl, rested blissfully ignorant that her youngest son was growing up right next to her.<br />
<br />
Puberty hit suddenly as Joey grew a foot rather suddenly it looked, his hands and feet growing large along side his gangly limbs, but just as soon as he&#39;d grown into an awkward scarecrow than muscle began to catch up and fill in his thin body. A thin body grew to be a lean body as his shoulders broadened, his face matured as hairs began appearing there, his legs, his arms, his groin, his chest, his armpits, and all over, from his now bulging penis which grew larger and longer as his testes dropped and flooded his growing body with testosterone. As Joey came to the end of puberty, his jaw squared, his cheek bones became more prominent and angular, and his muscles inflated to a well proportioned finish. Joey now looked more like a Joe as he unconsciously moved his large hand to his throbbing hard-on that was hard from the suddenly flow of testosterone flowing through his system. He groaned as his voice settled into a low baritone and Joe finished becoming a man and a beard began to grow out.<br />
<br />
The groan caught the attention of Cheryl who woke at first confused at where the groan could possibly have come from before turning over to see her half-asleep husband--the wedding band just at that moment appearing on Joe&#39;s hand as less physical changes beyond a few weathering and graying at the temples occurred compared to the mental ones which were telling Cheryl that Joe was her husband and father to her children, and extremely horny it seemed that he was trying to get off without her. That she couldn&#39;t have, no, definitely not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe...&quot; whispered Cheryl into her husband&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
Joe groaned, still half awake and half asleep. His eyes opening slightly, confused at the flood of memories that were barraging him, but knowing that if he just kept doing what he was doing, it&#39;d all work itself out just fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to get off without me?&quot; asked Cheryl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t want to wake you,&quot; grunted Joe, unsure of where those words came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m awake now, and willing to help you with this,&quot; said Cheryl as she slid her hand down to Joe&#39;s groin and joined his hand in massaging his member, causing Joe&#39;s toes to curl as a wave of pleasure overtook him, leaving him for the moment defenseless as he basked in the rush of hormones. Seeing her opportunity, Cheryl moved in, rolling on top of Joe so that she straddled him and could position her vagina with his hard on. She took it in and together they began to rhythmically roll with the fucking as Cheryl rode Joe and the changes finished up leaving the once four year old a forty-four year old, taking the forty years that John had shed. With the climax of the transfer of time, came the climax of Joe, shooting his load into Cheryl and her waiting fertile womb. As they breathed deeply in recovery from that round, Joe heard a commotion from the next room--Jeff&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, he shook Cheryl slightly and said, &quot;Honey, I&#39;ve gotta get up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just heard something thud over in the boys&#39; room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God, I can&#39;t wait for them to just grow up and let us have our afternoon fuck in peace,&quot; said Cheryl<br />
<br />
&quot;It was supposed to be a nap, but I thank you for the fuck. I&#39;ll make sure to make it up to you later,&quot; said Joe with a quick kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m holding you to that,&quot; noted Cheryl as Joe slipped out of bed and stumbled over to what had once been John&#39;s dresser, but now was his. He slipped on a pair of boxers and a white t-shirt before throwing on his bathrobe over it, noting that some leftover spunk was leaving a sticky spot on the front of his boxers. He stuck his feet into what had once been John&#39;s slippers that now were his, and tied his bathrobe firmly in place so as to hide the stain on the front of his boxers and walked over to Jeff and John&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Jeff was actually digging through his closet trying to find something old of his for John to wear, and had been throwing things loudly enough to invite the distraction. When the door opened and Joe poked his head in, at first Jeff was confused until suddenly an onslaught of memories began to appear. Gone was baby brother Joey, here was his Dad, Joe, who owned his own construction business--the chronivac taking the only big interest that four-year-old Joey had had in Lincoln logs, LEGOs, and blocks; and turning it into a career that he was decently well at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff what are you doing to your closet?&quot; asked Joe as he took a step into the room and crossed his arms with authority. John, who had no memory of who Joe had once been looked up to Joe with a kind of starstruck wonder, suddenly feeling a surge of jealousy and pride that Joe was his Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just looking for something for John to wear,&quot; said Jeff after his head had begun to clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t John have his--are those my clothes?&quot; asked Joe upon immediately seeing John standing in nothing but the overly large undershirt, the rest of the pants and shoes and socks and dress shirt strewn across the ground.<br />
<br />
John blushed, feeling rather bashful and ashamed of being caught with literally nothing on but his Dad&#39;s undershirt on. He felt suddenly very keenly aware of how close to naked he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just really want to be like you when I grow up,&quot;  said John bashfully.<br />
<br />
The stern look on Joe&#39;s face melted involuntarily as he bent over and picked up the discarded dress clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just ask next time you want to play dress up, Johnny. I want you to understand you can&#39;t go digging into other people&#39;s things without asking their permission first. Do you understand, or do I have to take away computer priviledges for a week?&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny nodded dutifully, which was both amazingly normal and weird for Jeff to witness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, and next time, if you ask me, I&#39;ll help you out and even teach you how to tie a tie,&quot; promised Joe, tuffling Johnny&#39;s hair affectionately. His entire hand easily fitting on top of Johnny&#39;s entire head. Johnny looked up in awe and admiration as Joe finished picking up the clothes, leaving the undershirt on Johnny for now, and then turning to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the next time he goes digging where he shouldn&#39;t, I want you to actually do something, Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re his big brother. Johnny&#39;s got a lot he can learn from you, and if you set an example by just sitting by and letting something happen that shouldn&#39;t, what do you think he&#39;s going to do when something similar happens for him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want me to... what?&quot; asked Jeff, confused by what his new father was asking of him. John as his Dad had never seemed to have had too much expectations of him, but then for most of his life he&#39;d been the baby of the family until Joey had come along... now though, things were different, and Jeff was unsure of whether that was a good difference or a bad one yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you see something&#39;s wrong, do something about it. Sure, today it&#39;s Johnny getting where he shouldn&#39;t and taking things he shouldn&#39;t, but for all you know Johnny some day somewhere might witness something like a robbery happen. I want him to be man enough to do something about it be it chase after the robber, take note of the robber as he flees, or help the person that was robbed, not just sit by and think it&#39;s not my job to do anything. And right now you&#39;re not doing a particularly good job of being a good example for him.<br />
<br />
Jeff was still trying to make sense of everything but increasingly this reality was beginning to become clear that Jeff and John really looked up to their father Joe, and in this reality this rebuke really held a lot of sway on him, and was really making Jeff feel like he&#39;d let his Dad down.<br />
<br />
Joe took Jeff by the shoulder and said, &quot;You have to be an example to him all the time, not just when it&#39;s convenient.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked at how Jeff was impacted by Joe&#39;s words and was amazed by how with just a few words, Dad could have such an impact on his big brother.<br />
<br />
And with that Joe took his leave of the room, leaving Jeff and John a better idea of what this reality entailed.</p>
