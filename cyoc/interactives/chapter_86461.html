<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning&#39;s work went by slowly - Jake&#39;s further expanded unit kept catching on his boxers in unfamiliar and quite uncomfortable ways, resulting in him having to squirm in his seat or go to the bathroom every few minutes for adjustment. This wasn&#39;t lost on Jane, who continued to fix him with a disapproving eye while he fidgeted and twitched. It wasn&#39;t just his penis that had expanded, Jake discovered - his testicles had sized up proportionately, or perhaps even somewhat disproportionately; each was now the size of a tennis ball, sitting fatly in his still smooth, boyish-looking (but definitely no longer boy-sized) sack. The slightest stimulation seemed to elicit a wash of precum that matched or exceeded his entire ejaculation back in the bad old days of five inch something. If he wasn&#39;t careful, it would leak through his jeans. I&#39;m sure Jane would just LOVE to report to the Director that I&#39;m incontinent as well as incompetent, he thought darkly. No further growth seemed to be forthcoming - apparently whoever had given him a second dose of growth was satisfied with his nearly doubled endowment - but he couldn&#39;t stop worrying about the watch. Just your luck, Jakey-boy, he thought, solid proof of the supernatural, or at least some kind of alien technology, and what do you do? You lose it at the first opportunity. Gritting his teeth he levered himself up for the umpteenth time and went to get a cup of coffee, trying to restrain himself from flipping the bird in Jane&#39;s sour features as she fixed him with an evil eye.<br />
<br />
He almost didn&#39;t recognise Josh as he wandered through from the reception area - which was what Electric Marketing called the largely unfinished area by the door with a sofa. The body-builder seemed to have shrunken in on himself, slumped over so he was barely taller than Josh. And that broad waist looked more like a paunch this morning due to his depressed posture, obvious fat pressing against his tight T. Shit, Jake thought. Just what I need; the guy I humiliated in front of his girlfriend last night coming to pick a fight. I&#39;m gonna be sacked, aren&#39;t I? He tried to duck back into the open office, but Josh had caught his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake!&quot; The voice was urgent, but not hostile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Jake said, uncertain. &quot;Josh. You know where I work. Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Liz told me. Look, I kinda need to discuss something.&quot; He rolled his eyes in a manner that Jake thought was probably meant to communicate further meaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Jake turned back to the cafetiere and poured black coffee into the pot. &quot;Shoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm, you got somewhere private in this place? It&#39;s kinda embarassing.&quot; Josh looked even more miserable.<br />
<br />
Though he didn&#39;t look in a mood to be beating anyone up, Jake still wasn&#39;t entirely convinced it was in his best interests to be alone with the bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m really busy this morning,&quot; he said, trying to pitch his voice so it carried to Jane. &quot;What&#39;s all this about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh looked down, face red. &quot;It&#39;s ... It&#39;s smaller.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh. Right. Jake had almost forgotten that he had downsized his competition in the escalating rapture of his own growth. Suck for you, buddy, he thought, but I don&#39;t have the watch right now. If I did, I&#39;d have you back to normal in a jiffy. He could even give him a bit extra to work with without compromising the hierarchy established in Liz and Katie&#39;s minds. Oh well, it&#39;s not like it would do Josh any harm to see how normal people lived. And Jake had left him with an above-average one anyway; it&#39;s not like he&#39;d reduced him to even Jake&#39;s old size.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably just the way they measured it, man - heck, I normally consider myself a good inch or two larger than - what did they say for me? Eight inches?&quot; Nicely done there, Jake, you&#39;ve almost established an alibi for your current size.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dude, you don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s smaller AGAIN. Smaller than yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm.&quot; Jake furrowed his brow and took a sip of coffee. &quot;Sorry, my brain is on the blink. Could you run that by me again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh blushed even more deeply. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s shrunk since last night. Come on, dude, help me out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably just performance anxiety,&quot; said Jake, trying desperately to sound knowledgeable while his head raced. Assuming Josh had genuinely shrunk further, and wasn&#39;t just having a crisis-of-meathead-confidence, that might imply the current owner of the watch (or heck, for all he knew, another item from that weird shop) was fucking around with him too.<br />
<br />
&quot;What exactly do you want me to do?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to take a look, dude, tell me if you think I should see a doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake almost snorted black coffee out of his nostrils. &quot;No way, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, please. This is serious.&quot; Josh looked so distraught that Jake, worried that he might soon have a 6&#39; 6&#39;&#39; bodybuilder bawling in his workplace kitchen, grabbed him and maneuvered him over to the stationery cupboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, but nothing weird, right? Just, I don&#39;t know, pull your shirt out of your boxers and stretch out your pants or something.&quot; Jake tried to keep his voice at a normal register - nothing was surer to attract Jane&#39;s attention than the sibilant rustle of whispering.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Look!&quot; said Josh, his voice seeming alarmingly loud in the confines of the walk-in cupboard. Somehow it was harder to look down the other man&#39;s trousers while he was fully clothed than it had been to look at his equipment last night fully naked. Of course, that might have been the presence of both of their girlfriends. Jake opened one eye, and beheld a healthy, just-under-three-inches flaccid penis, slightly lost under Josh&#39;s big blond bush of pubic hair. The testicles were unobtrusive - perhaps even diminutive.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kinda cold today,&quot; he said doubtfully. The taller man responded by abruptly beginning to stoke himself up, large hands kneading at light pink flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, no, you cannot be doing that here,&quot; said Jake, still trying to keep his voice pitch flat. Jesus Christ, if there&#39;s anything worse than getting beaten up by your girlfriend&#39;s-friend&#39;s-boyfriend in the workplace kitchen, it&#39;s probably getting caught looking at his dick in the supply closet.<br />
<br />
Josh&#39;s three-incher expanded, slowly, the head seeming larger in comparison to the almost slender shaft than Jake remembered. It crossed the four-inch mark with a shocking lack of haste, even considering that the body builder didn&#39;t have two hot women to help him out. For a moment, Jake was sure it would stop before it reached five inches, but it pushed on, expanding now only in length, not girth, finally making its final stand (a perky 40 degrees or so). It was maybe five and a half, maybe a little less; and slim with it. The testicles nestled under it were equally diminished; Cadbury&#39;s mini-eggs at best, now. Jake boggled. The imposing body-builder was now smaller, genital-wise, than Jake had been since around 14. The thought was rapidly plumping Jake&#39;s enlarged cock, and the denim was already straining as it strove for freedom. Probably not best to let on that you have almost twice the cock he has now, Jake thought. He&#39;s either likely to think we somehow swapped dicks - and that&#39;s not really an argument I want to get into at the office - or it&#39;ll break him completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, man, I get it. That&#39;s weird. Put it away now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see it, right? I wasn&#39;t that small before. Now way was I this small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jake said, wondering if he was making the right choice in agreeing with him. Come on, he thought, convince him he&#39;s always been that size, it can&#39;t be that hard (pun probably unintended).<br />
<br />
&quot;Yours hasn&#39;t changed size any, though?&quot; Josh said, and for a moment Jake&#39;s breath caught in his throat. Did Josh know about the watch? &quot;I mean, yours hasn&#39;t shrunk? I read online there are, like, African diseases that can make your dick shrink...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;No way, man, those are just superstitions. Look, mine was fine this morning, but there&#39;s all kinds of things that can affect your performance. I agree though, you&#39;re smaller than last night. If you&#39;re worried, why not go to the walk-in clinic at the town centre - you know where that is, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh nodded. He had just finished zipping up his pants when the door opened and Natasha, a rather attractive young hire - eighteen or nineteen - with smoky dark eyes and hair and full chest on a slim, petite frame, came through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry. Didn&#39;t realise you were meeting in here,&quot; she said, in delightfully French-accented tones.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries,&quot; said Jake, impressing himself with his smooth patter. &quot;We need toner for the printer in Unit 4 - do you know which of these it takes?&quot; He waved his arms at the almost identical rows of cartridge boxes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; said Natasha, putting a finger up to her very full, pillowy lips and standing regarding the boxes, her moderate weight resting on one hip. Shit, Jake thought, so much for cooling down. Isn&#39;t she&#39;s a little young for you, Mr mid-twenties? He became aware of Josh&#39;s envious eyes on his crotch, even as his junk distended one thigh into an unsightly lump. It looked like he had stuffed with a draft excluder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think maybe this one?&quot; She picked up one of the boxes. Jake smiled and gestured to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dude,&quot; Josh said. &quot;I think I&#39;m gonna check out the clinic. Good luck with Katie.&quot; The body-builder clapped Jake on the shoulder with alarming force. &quot;I&#39;m not bitter or anything, you know? You were the bigger man, I think maybe even if I were my normal size&quot; (gotta love shifting perceptions, Jake thought) &quot;but I gotta try and set this right. Liz was already going off me last night; what the fuck is she gonna think now?&quot; He left, still slumped over and gut thrust out before him.<br />
<br />
Jake sat back down at his monitor and tried to absorb the implications of what he had learned.</p>
