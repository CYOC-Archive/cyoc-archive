<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James Jubilee or “JJ” woke up in his dads trailer. His dad was making JJ’s favorite breakfast Belgian Waffles. JJ walked down the hall from his bedroom and saw that his Dad and made waffles that said “Happy 15th Birthday!!” James completely forgot it was his birthday. His Dad gave him a hug and they both sat down for breakfast. <br />
<br />
James Jubilee was a shorter boy for his age being about 5’ 6” while his dad Jack Jubilee was an impressive 6’ 4”, he had always told James that he was a late bloomer. James sat there eating his waffles with his cropped brown hair with green eyes and slimmer build. His dad had slicked back brown hair and green eyes. <br />
<br />
Finishing up breakfast Jack pulled James over. He had to explain what turning 15 meant for him. James was aware of magic of the circus only for him it was different instead of learning just a single circus, since his father was the ringleader he had to learn all of them. This would mean instead of just turning into one thing he would spend the next year turning into each of the acts 1 month at a time. For example he would have to spend the month looking like a clown and learning their ways, or he would turn into a lion to learn what it was like. James was excited but still a little nervous what the next year would entail. <br />
<br />
After they had finished breakfast James heard a knock at the door to their trailer. Opening it he saw his friends LoLo and Milo standing there since they had school. LoLo originally Logan had a Snow White face with bright red cheeks and an Afro of red hair. He was wearing a white shirt with blue stripes on it along some loose fitting pants held up by suspenders, and a pair of blue clown shoes. LoLo  had actually already turned 15 a couple of months ago and change into a clown. Milo was an even shorter kid than James only about 5’ 4”. He had his brown hair in a bob style haircut. He was wearing some nicer shoes, jeans with a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up a red. Decorated vest and a black bow tie. He was also wearing a tall black top hat with a red stripe on hit. The only thing that was a little bit off was his ears and his teeth. He had just started his transformation. He would spend the next year as his mother’s assistant. In this case he would become the rabbit she would pull out of her hat. So he had grown a pair of big tall white rabbit ears sticking out of slits cut through the brim of his hat, and he had a pair of buck teeth similar to a rabbits. He also had the beginnings of whiskers forming. <br />
<br />
Both boys said happy birthday to James. Say thanks and runs back to his room to get dressed. JJ put on a plane white shirt black pants a basic red tailcoat and tall black boots. He runs back outside and joins his friends as they walk to school. Arriving, JJ saw LoLo’s brothers Jazzy and Oliver. Jazzy LoLo’s older Brother wore similar clothes to him as they were both full clowns now. Oliver in the other hand was just wearing a white shirt tucked into a pair of baggy colorful jeans held up by suspenders with normal shoes. Since he was only 13 and not a clown yet. <br />
<br />
JJ said hi to them along with a number of other kids some changed some not. As the day went on they finished up their school work eventually they made their way to the practice ring to prepaid for the show. LoLo went with his brothers to practice their clown act and Milo walked over to his mom to rehearse. All JJ got to do was sit on the sit and wait. Unlike the rest of the acts since the ringleader didn’t have a total routine JJs never gotten the change to go out on stage to perform. As the rehearsals finished up everyone walked back to their trailers to get ready for the show. JJ arrived back his trailer walking in in his father getting ready for the show. Jack brought James into his bed room where he showed him his birthday present his own ringleader’s costume. Similar to his own. It’s included the white dress shirt, cropped pants only going down to about mid calf, the knee high shiny black boots, the sparkly bright red gold decorate tail coat, along with a red bow tie and a big top hat. Jack told James that this was the start of his real journey at the circus. He said that after tonight he would start his first change that could be anything. He could wake tomorrow with a clown nose, and lions mane, or even an acrobats build<br />
<br />
Everyone made their ways back to the circus tent james was standing by the ring door watching his dad pump up the crowd. He turned around and saw his friends LoLo and Milo both now in the costumes. LoLo being in a full clown jumpsuit looking behind him JJ saw jazzy and Oly all dressed up ready to go. Milo was there in his red decorated vest with a black suit jacket over it with a short red cake coming off of it. He had his top hat with the bunny ears coming out. He was also wearing black dress shorts instead of pants because tonight he would be practicing his first full transformation into a rabbit by doing a flip into his moms had and pop out as a rabbit. Both boys were in awe at JJ’s outfit and how cool it looked. Milo was nibbling on a carrot before it was his turn to go out. Just then Jack introduces “Magical Moira and her assistant Mythical Milo”!! JJ looked back at LoLo and asked him what they were going to do tonight? LoLo said that Jazzy, Oly and him were going to some slapstick and throw some pies at each other. After they finished talking about it Milo and his mom came walking backstage with Milo on his moms shoulder as a small rabbit. He then hopped off Moira pulled out Milo’s hat placed it over the rabbit, when hands from the inside come out and started to pickup the hat. Milo’s feet ended came out on to the ground followed by the rest of him. Still having his rabbit ears and the like but he was still wearing his magicians outfit. Jack then introduced LoLo and his brothers to the stage. <br />
<br />
Once the 3 clown brother were covered in enough pie and having fallen over a number of times. They each bowed and ran backstage. Jack then invited the whole circus to come out and he started to explain the history of the circus with each new generation of performers. Gesturing towards Milo and LoLo as examples. Each of them bowing. He then said that he would like to introduce his the next ringleader James “JJ” Jubilee!! Walking out from backstage for the first time JJ was stunned by the crowd, James’ father snapped as a birthday cake appeared James walked up  and blew out the candles signifying that his future at the circus and his first change would start tomorrow.</p>
