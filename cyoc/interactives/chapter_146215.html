<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unaware of some of the bigger things going on in Moon Lake, Tad Decker was enjoying some &quot;family&quot; time that afternoon/evening as his father&#39;s parents, Josephine and Jacob Decker had come to visit. A lot of it came from some of the chaotic fallout that had come after the big debate that Tad and Amy had gone to. To a certain extent, Tad agreed with Tom&#39;s reasoning in the debate and that were society might be reaching a point were &quot;the secret&quot; wasn&#39;t going to truly protect them any longer, if that point hadn&#39;t already been reached and Moon Lake had simply gotten lucky that something hadn&#39;t happened to expose weres otherwise. But that didn&#39;t mean that what the City Council decided, if only narrowly, was going to be super popular.<br />
<br />
After all, the secrecy of weres being real beings had been there for centuries, largely beginning when scientific knowledge began to reach a point where claims of magic and sorcery lost its edge, and had largely worked. The fact that it had worked would be good enough for some to keep the secret, as the debate that Amy&#39;s parents had had over the issue indicated. How Tad&#39;s own parents had raised him reflected that as well. He&#39;d always had to be careful to make sure that no one could suspect that the Deckers were a family of weres. Thus when the suggestion was made to change things that had been a fundamental part of how weres lived, regardless of it being in Moon Lake or not, there was going to be resistance to that change.<br />
<br />
And even Josephine and Jacob had those concerns when they came over. From there it soon became something of a meet and greet, as neither Jacob nor Josephine had met Claire, yet. Both Jenn and Tad were a bit nervous on how they would react to Claire, especially for the fact that Jen and Claire had started up a very adult and romantic relationship after Claire became a werecat. Jen feared disapproval because of her past marriage to their son Jeff, and the fact that she still loved Jeff Decker dearly. In fact, had Jeff not been murdered and the Deckers still returned to Moon Lake, while Jen figured she might turn Claire if she was that willing to be a werecat at the cost of becoming at least bisexual, but wouldn&#39;t leave Jeff for Claire. Thankfully, though, Josephine and Jacob seemed to be rather accepting. The only &quot;excitement&quot; had been over a stray mouse that Jen caught and ate.<br />
<br />
From there, Jacob and Josephine inquired into Tad&#39;s relationship with Amy Howler. Tad was happy to share, even if a bit surprised that they knew of his dating Amy. He guessed that his mom might have told them or they had seen him and Amy in their fursonas on one of the past few nights when they&#39;d been having fun in the woods, some rather tame in taking Amy&#39;s younger brothers for a hike, some of it hunting, and some more adult, which for Tad and Amy both being eighteen, that wasn&#39;t an issue. Tad inwardly smiled as his grandparents accepted his relationship with Amy and made very pleasant small talk with her after she arrived. It partially moved things away from the bigger debate with the were secret and into a more &quot;getting to know you&quot; sort of thing, which was much more pleasant to talk about as they moved to the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it is good to see that you&#39;ve been helping Tad get used to things here in Moon Lake,&quot; Josephine said to Amy as she and Tad sat on the floor in front of the couch where Josephine and Jacob were seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he&#39;s been pretty friendly and he and Jen have been helpful to my family with some issues,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;I&#39;d think good things have gone both ways in the relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always good to hear,&quot; Jacob gave a small smile and nod to that, &quot;and Tad, you&#39;re treating her right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Tad said with a small nod which both his grandparents and Jen smiled at. Tad took that as some sign of approval, which he did like, but it also reflected a lot about who he felt he was. He could remember his parents teaching him about tolerance and respect for all people, regardless of race, creed, religion, gender, or sexuality. It was all something he ultimately wanted to live up to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff and I both stressed that he treat people with respect,&quot; Jen spoke as she looked to Jacob and Josephine from one easy chair that faced the back door, &quot;and to a great extent... that&#39;s been an area where Tad does take after his father. He&#39;d be proud...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s voice fell off a bit, though things got a bit better when she felt Claire&#39;s hand on hers. She looked up to Jacob and Josephine smile and nod as well. She&#39;d had concerns that Jeff&#39;s parents wouldn&#39;t take to her relationship with Claire very well, but thankfully they both did seem to accept the relationship. That acceptance let Jen remain calm, especially when Claire stated she wasn&#39;t out to replace Jeff in her heart. She had strangely found herself growing more and more interested in Claire as she adapted to being a werecat and actually began to show greater interest in Jen as well. In this, Jen&#39;s heart was warmed by the comfort that Claire wasn&#39;t out to replace Jeff, which only confirmed to Jen that there was enough room in her heart for both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what are your college plans?&quot; Josephine asked, &quot;getting all the applications in will be meeting their deadlines soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad gave a small sigh at that. His father&#39;s death and the move to Moon Lake that followed had put on hold much of the discussion on what colleges to apply for. As it would have the potential that if the colleges that were on the list before then were still there, there would be other things to figure out. As they had done a bit of touring over the previous summer, but all of those colleges were in area within easy driving distance of where the Decker family had lived in Quantico. Now, though, that would mean going across the country. Moon Lake&#39;s college was on the list, but he really wasn&#39;t familiar with the other colleges in the area, or if he still would go to the ones that he&#39;d gotten to visit before his father&#39;s murder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... for the moment... Moon Lake&#39;s college would be high on the list,&quot; Tad said slowly, &quot;though... I think mom and I need to talk some things over regarding some other local colleges.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake College is pretty good in many respects,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;and it&#39;s popular in the area as it allows Moon Lake&#39;s weres to live in some degree of safety that the other colleges would require extra steps...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how that will change if this reveal goes through,&quot; Jacob said with a sigh, thinking back on Jeff&#39;s courtship with Jen back then. There were the occasional issues, but nothing super serious and Moon Lake seemed to just continue on as it always had. However, if things moved forward with what had been reported, that would almost certainly mean some change on nearly every level. Colleges outside of Moon Lake might want to know if students are weres and administrators for the state might supervise Moon Lake more closely than they&#39;ve done before.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of it will probably depend on how this werefox&#39;s plan works,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;if works out well... while there might be some requirement to present information whether or not one is a were... things may not be too bad and weres will get the option to live openly and freely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming things go well,&quot; Josephine said slowly as she looked to Tad and then to Jen, &quot;Which... sometimes I&#39;ll worry on. Because if things don&#39;t go right... I... I don&#39;t want to lose either of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if things are difficult,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;the vote at the meeting ruled that only the secret would be revealed. It wouldn&#39;t necessarily reveal Moon Lake. In that... I&#39;d guess that some things about Moon Lake won&#39;t change too much until the overall picture is set on the &quot;right&quot; pace as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully they do go right,&quot; Jacob nodded.</p>
