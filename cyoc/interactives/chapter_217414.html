<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen spent the entire weekend as a dog. Mostly. Her mother insisted that she review the packet of assignments from her school. Jen sat at her desk and tried to read through them, but the shirt and shorts she had thrown on in place of her pads kept distracting her. They just itched too much. Eventually she tore them off and lay on the floor, spreading her papers out around her. It was much more comfortable down there. Her mother didn&#39;t even bat an eye when she came to check on her. She just rubbed Jen&#39;s head and called her a good girl. Jen beamed and wiggled in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Without the human distractions of clothing and chairs, Jen found it easy to complete the homework. It was mostly just review of everything she had already learned anyway. Satisfied that she wouldn&#39;t have too much trouble on her finals, she pulled on her pads and went downstairs for a break. The kitchen door was open to let in the early summer breeze. Jen trotted through it without a second thought and went to squat on the lawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked up, startled. Her mother was standing in a flower bed, staring at her in horror. She rushed over and grabbed her daughter by the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing out here?!&quot; she whispered hoarsely, trying not to shout. &quot;The neighbors might see you!&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked around nervously as she said this. As if the yard might contain hidden eyes that were watching them even now. She tried to haul Jen to her feet, but the girl&#39;s knee-pads prevented her from standing upright. Tracy half led, half dragged Jen back to the kitchen door. Once inside she let Jen slump back down onto all fours and stood glaring down at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you thinking?!&quot; her voice was strained from the effort of not shouting. &quot;What were you even doing out there?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen whined and crouched lower, A month spent acting like a dog had left its marks. Tracy stared incredulously at her daughter&#39;s behavior. Then her face softened and she crouched down. She reached out a hand and began gently rubbing Jen&#39;s head, just like she would a dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Jen,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I know that this is what you want and makes you happy, but other people aren&#39;t as accepting as I am. I&#39;ll see what I can do to make the backyard more private for you, but until then you need to stay indoors when you&#39;re like... this. Why were you even out there anyway? Taking a break from studying?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen whimpered and pressed her knees together. She really needed to go now. Being interrupted didn&#39;t help. Tracy stared at her for a moment, then her eyes went wide with shocked understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um...&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I... I see...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tracy stared around the kitchen in mild panic. For a moment she glanced out the still open back door, but she dismissed that immediately. Jen was lucky that she hadn&#39;t been spotted by the neighbors the first time. It was a nice day outside and she could hear them faintly. The sound of lawnmowers and distant conversation combined with the enticing smell of barbecue told her that there was too much of a risk that someone might pop a head over the fence or look out an open second story window.<br />
<br />
She was about to force Jen to just use a toilet like a human when her eyes alighted on a slightly dusty cardboard box sitting atop the fridge. She dashed over and pulled it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will have to do for now.&quot; she said triumphantly and placed the box on the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
Jen recognized it immediately. It was the absorbent puppy pads that they had used to housebreak Rex when he was still small. She gave a short bark of approval as her mother pulled one out and spread it on the floor. Tracy stared in awe as her daughter scurried forwards and crouched in the middle of the mat. With a look of intense relief Jen unleashed a heavy stream of piss right onto the pad. She didn&#39;t care that her own mother was watching her. When she had finished she looked up at Tracy expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Tracy asked, confused.<br />
<br />
Jen whimpered and wiggled her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- Oh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Realization dawned as Tracy recalled the book that Amelia had given her. She had read it last night. Most of it was just details about the various commands that Jen and Rex had been taught and how to best utilize them, but a few pages had been added to the back with information relating specifically to Jen. Remembering the part about hygiene, Tracy grabbed a packet of wet-wipes from beside the sink and carefully wiped her daughter&#39;s privates. Satisfied, Jen trotted out of the kitchen and back to her room leaving Tracy to clean up the now soaked pad.<br />
<br />
Once back in her room she cleared away the finished homework and books and got down to her next task. Revenge. Kyle was going to pay for what he did to her. Sure she was enjoying it to some degree. She had never dreamed that it would be so freeing to simply let herself become a dog like this. She wouldn&#39;t thank Kyle for this gift, though. The humiliation he had forced on her still burned hot in her stomach. The core of her revenge would be the curse itself. Kyle had made a mistake leaving it in her hands like this. A mistake she wasn&#39;t planning to repeat.<br />
<br />
Monday came all too quickly. Jen was forced to dress in normal clothing and attend school to take her finals. She had tried to convince her mother to let her at least wear her collar, but Tracy had been adamant that it was to be left at home. The tests were easy, even if Jen was uncomfortable in her clothes. The hard part was meeting all of her friends.<br />
<br />
Kyle had, of course, told everyone who would listen where Jen had gone. Thankfully no one believed him. Rumors still spread, however, and Jen had to squash them now before they got too out of control. She told everyone that she had gotten seriously sick and had to be hospitalized for a month. Her short hair and hoarse voice helped to sell this lie.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was some auto-immune thing.&quot; Jen told the rest of the cheer squad. &quot;I can&#39;t remember all the details, my head&#39;s still fuzzy. But I&#39;m alright now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tuesday was easier. She had forced herself to remain clothed all Monday evening so she wouldn&#39;t feel as uncomfortable. It was the last day of finals and Jen whipped through them as easily as she had the previous day&#39;s. <br />
Wednesday was supposed to be the official last day of school, but Jen told everyone that she was still tired and was going to stay home. Then as an after-thought remarked that the doctors wanted her to rest for as much of the summer as possible, so she probably wouldn&#39;t have much time to hang out.<br />
<br />
When she got home Tuesday afternoon she nearly tore her clothes off before pulling her collar and pads back on. Then it was only a matter of waiting.<br />
<br />
Tracy had mentioned that Kyle&#39;s mother had told her about him being enrolled in the obedience school&#39;s new program. She had gone on and on about how she was so proud of Jen for helping Amelia set it all up. Jen, in turn, had learned the date that Kyle would be coming back. While she waited for that day to come she refined her plans. It would be nearly two weeks until then, so Jen decided that spending her time relaxing was best.<br />
<br />
Tracy surprised her Wednesday morning with her very own dog bed. She put it next to Rex&#39;s in the living room and told Jen that if she wanted she could have another for her bedroom as well. Later that day a package arrived with two dog bowls with &#39;Jen&#39; stenciled on the sides. Jen was more than a little shocked by this. The effects of the curse should have ended by now, yet her mother was still openly embracing Jen&#39;s new-found doggy-hood. She began to worry that maybe Kyle had done something to her as well, but couldn&#39;t figure out how.<br />
<br />
Thursday and Friday were uneventful. Jen mostly lounged around the house and made use of her new dog bed. She spent a good bit of her time returning calls and texts she had received while at the obedience school. Most of them were friends trying to find out what had happened to her. She told everyone who hadn&#39;t already heard about her fictional hospital stay and fended off offers to come and visit.<br />
<br />
Friday evening her mother informed her that there would be workmen coming around on Saturday to replace the fence. Jen was expected to be properly dressed and acting human while they were there. She wasn&#39;t happy about it, but agreed when Tracy explained that the new fence was going to be an extra-tall privacy one to help shield the yard from prying eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And on Sunday the landscapers will be here to plant some trees and hedges. By the time they&#39;re done it will be safe for you to do your business in the yard instead of using the puppy pads.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen listened to her mother prattle on about neighborhood gossip while she ate her dinner from her new bowls. Betty had been thoughtful enough to include the recipes for Jen&#39;s doggy meals in the book and Tracy was taking full advantage of them. It helped that they were extremely healthy, well-balanced meals.<br />
<br />
Jen endured the weekend as a human. The workmen replacing the fence had been a little confused about why such a tall fence was needed, but once they saw the size of Rex they decided it was almost certainly necessary. The landscapers didn&#39;t bat an eye as they planted the requested trees and shrubs in the indicated locations. They were used to eccentric clients and just assumed it had something to do with Feng Shui or something. When the workers finally left Sunday evening Jen was allowed out to explore the garden to her heart&#39;s content.<br />
<br />
She had had a blast running around on a lawn for the first time in over a week. Tracy watched with amusement as her daughter ran in circles, played tug-of-war with Rex, and even experimented with lifting her leg to mark a few of the new trees. The rest of the week was just a blissful, doggy blur, but Friday came all too soon and Jen had business to attend to.<br />
<br />
On Friday morning Jen woke up, showered, and dressed. She wore her collar, but left the pads. Today she needed to be human. Mostly. She carefully snuck out in the pre-dawn twilight and made her way down the street towards Kyle&#39;s house. Her plan was simple. She knew Kyle was coming home that morning. She would sneak into his house, then lie in wait in his bedroom until he arrived. Then she would spring her trap.<br />
<br />
She arrived at his house just as his mother was leaving. Seeing her chance, Jen dove under the closing garage door and managed to avoid the sensor. Since his mother had just left, Jen figured she had only a couple of hours to get situated. She made her way upstairs and found what was unmistakably his room. It was a horrible mess and stank of god knows what. She cracked open the window a bit to try and air it out, then settled in to wait.<br />
<br />
It was a very boring two hours. Jen had left her phone at home to not compromise her stealth. She tried to use Kyle&#39;s computer, but it had a password. She made a few half-hearted attempts at guessing it, but gave up. Finally, when she was just about to change her entire plan and leave, she heard the garage door opening. She quickly took up a position behind the bedroom door and waited for her unwitting prey.<br />
<br />
She heard quite a bit of shouting from downstairs. One voice was rather hoarse and had a bit of a growl to it. Jen smirked at the sound of it. She heard footsteps stomping up the stairs and tensed herself. The door flew open and Kyle shouted one last angry remark at his mother before slamming it behind him.<br />
<br />
Jen waited half a moment then spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kyle! Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle spun around, but it was too late. Jen tackled him and easily pinned him to the floor with her teeth on his neck. He struggled briefly, but unlike Jen he hadn&#39;t cooperated with the trainers and missed out on all the exercise Jen had gotten. She held him down while he struggled and anytime he tried to speak she growled and bit down a little harder. After a minute had elapsed she pushed herself off him and stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare!&quot; he said triumphantly as he struggled to his feet.<br />
<br />
Jen gave him a predatory grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; she growled, &quot;It&#39;s been well over a minute now. You get both.&quot;<br />
<br />
The color drained from Kyle&#39;s face. He tried to dodge past Jen towards the door but a mysterious force held him in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had quite some time to think of how I was going to get my revenge for what you did.&quot; Jen said, still grinning. &quot;Quite. Some. Time. I&#39;m not about to let you get away with only half of a curse. First off, your transform. When you have fulfilled the first half of your dare, you will become a little bitch. A sweet little mongrel bitch. You will stay that way for the rest of your natural life. Everyone will think that you always were one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s face turned a pale shade of green. Jen&#39;s grin widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your dare, I dare you to pass the curse back to me. I will answer, and you will say what is written on this piece of paper.&quot;<br />
<br />
She held up a sheet of paper before his eyes. She had carefully written out the instructions so there would be no mistakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;After that, your transform will come into effect and you will be the sweetest little doggy anyone has ever seen. Unable to even hurt a fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt his arm move. He struggled, but there was no resisting the curse. He watched his own hand take the sheet of paper. Felt his own lips form the words. Heard his own voice say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
