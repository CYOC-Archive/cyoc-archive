<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The only noise in the living room of Hugo&#39;s small apartment was that of typing fingers. Another report needed to be filled. He&#39;d &#39;accidentally&#39; lost a few dicks during the rooms&#39; inspection, and such, needed to explain to his superiors that the chances of recovering them were very low, and that the best course of action was to led those &#39;poor&#39; men live the rest of their lives as dicks. With any luck, they would take him at his words. If not, well, maybe some strike team would be sent to retrieve the test subjects and *punish* the thieves. likely by dicking them too.<br />
<br />
Hugo managed not to smile at the idea. He was a consummate professional, after all. Glancing away from his screen, he doublechecked on the test subjects floating in his lava lamp, human cock edition. Number 43 seemed to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
As he went to return to his work, knocking at his door got his attention. As he stood, Hugo quietly activated his security system. Perhaps it would be another pair of police officers? It turned out to be a crowd of frat boys, led to the front by the bulky football team captain and a tall, muscled black guy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Hugo asked. <br />
<br />
Connor smirked and let himself in, alongside the crowd. &quot;We need your help with a little debate we had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor lounged around the room, before leaning with one elbow on the back of the couch. &quot;Well, Dominic and I were debating which one of us has the bigger dick, you see? And, to motivate ourselves, we made a little bet. The winner has to become the loser&#39;s dick to teach him humility. Of course, we can&#39;t do that without your help, Hugo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone looking at him must have thought Hugo was annoyed by the request. Yet, internally, Hugo was punching the air. After weeks of work, the societal structure inside the campus was slowly devolving into a dick-based hierarchy and men could not stop trying to dick each others and establish their superiority. How fascinating was it that the bet&#39;s terms meant that the *winner* of the bet would be turned into his own cock? That they were starting to think of it as a reward rather than a punishment? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I could be the judge for the competition. But I have one condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
The competitors grew a little tense hearing this. For once, Dominic looked somewhat worried. Connor was one thing, but rumors were spreading about Hugo and his very scientifically inclined mind. Fortunately for them, Hugo&#39;s intentions were pure enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;The loser has to walk around naked for the duration of his ownership of the winner. That way, they can&#39;t hide the result or their shame. Otherwise, what&#39;s the point?&quot;<br />
<br />
And this way, he would spread the idea of men becoming someone else&#39;s cock. Those two were offering him the opportunity he wanted to extend the experiment&#39;s parameters. <br />
<br />
Both Connor and Dominic looked hesitant for a split second. Obviously, the image of themselves with a dick of a different color had crossed their minds. No one could deny the obvious superiority of the winner with such contrasts at play. <br />
<br />
With that announcement made, the crowd gathered around Hugo&#39;s couch, where the two competitors sat and pulled down their zippers. Immediately, a few guys let out low whistle. Connor had good reasons to be confident. His penis already looked larger than most of theirs, and he was still soft in his hands. Dominic, on the other hand, calmly pulled himself out of his pants and winked at a guy in the crowd. <br />
<br />
A thin redhead named Dylan knelt before Dominic and began to lick the floppy cock, gently sucking the tip and kissing its length until it stood tall and stiff. Tender black hands gently pushed the man away, murmuring something about getting another chance later on.<br />
<br />
Both of them were at their hardest, and it was hard to tell the difference, especially with Dominic&#39;s larger height. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me,&quot; Hugo said, leaning over the horse-like cocks. He held out his tablet, who quickly produced a scan. &quot;Connor Marvel&#39;s penis, measurements: 11 inches long. Dominic Francoeur&#39;s penis measurements: 12 inches long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor grunted as the crowd cheered for Dominic, who sneered at his inferior. &quot;Aw, don&#39;t be sad, lil&#39; guy. I&#39;m gonna help you feel big for a couple of days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got barely an inch on me, you goddamned horse,&quot; he growled. <br />
<br />
Dominic leaned forward, all too smug, and pressed a kiss on Connor&#39;s forehead. &quot;Poor boy. Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll know what it&#39;s like to have a big dick in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheers rose up. Hugo took that as his cue to take out his camera and clicked on the flash.<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH!&quot; shouted a few lusty guys, which was followed by more cheering and clapping. <br />
<br />
On the couch, Dominic&#39;s enormous black dick was lying against Connor&#39;s leg. His large balls twitched and light reflected on the drop of pre at the tip of his dickhead. Hugo wasted no time and began to install the communication chip. Being honest with himself, he was looking forward to hearing that arrogant jock get another talking down to (Connor had a hidden submissive side, his computer told him). <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well,&quot; Dominic&#39;s voice came from the black penis, &quot;what&#39;s taking so long, Connor? Or did you forget all the details of our bet once you saw how big I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
With no other choice, Connor stripped of his remaining clothes. Tossing aside his shirt and kicking off his pants and shoes. With a bit of bravado, he flexed his arms and showed off his very toned abs and pecs. In all other circumstances, Connor would be an absolute treat to the eyes, and he knew it. However, with the bet over his head, he felt fare more disgruntled than usual, naked. <br />
<br />
Hugo didn&#39;t care about insignificant details like that. He just patted himself on the back for an opportunity not slipping through his fingers. With no further ceremony, he picked up Dominic and pushed him on Connor&#39;s groin. Within seconds, the change had operated, and Connor was left with a big black cock where his pale white one used to be. <br />
<br />
It really looked ridiculous on him. Like a prop. Or maybe an overcompensation. Connor started to blush. <br />
<br />
Kyle, infamous horndog on campus, wolfwhistle and shouted &#39;call me, big guy&#39; to the general laughter of the crowd. He was flipped the bird for his comment, but Connor did not dare do more than that. <br />
<br />
Dominic, however, &quot;Sure thing, sweetheart! See you tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor tried to pull his new foreskin over Dominic&#39;s dickhead, but it did not even muffle the sound. It did get him a short lecture on how to properly treat his cock though. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Hugo,&quot; some other footballer called out, &quot;mind if Greg and I take a turn to cockfight? We also need to settle who&#39;s got the biggest cock around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo pretended to sigh. &quot;Fine. Drop your pants, guys.&quot;</p>
