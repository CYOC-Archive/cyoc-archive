<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nikki thought her friend's question over, trying to decide if there even was anything about herself that she'd change. Back when she had been in high school the answer would have been a resounding yes. Ever since she had been little she had known that she was different from the other girls and her parents had tried to prepare her for any problems she might face. They had been accepting, treating her just like a normal little girl, and for all intents and purposes, she had been even if she had a penis. She had taken in as a part of who she was and thought nothing of it until she reached high school. Girls were mean of course and she had been though more than her fair share of tormenting because of her penis, but that wasn't the worst of it. Like any other teenage girl she had been insecure and as her friends started entering puberty she had started to worry about what it would mean for her. She knew that she was a girl, but she worried that somehow that might change. There had been many nights where she had cried herself to sleep, afraid that instead of her breasts budding and her hips widening she would start changing into a boy, getting muscular and hairy, growing taller and having her voice get deeper. During those miserable nights she would have done anything to have a pussy, even if the thought of having a period terrified her almost as much as the thought of becoming a guy. She had been a late bloomer, but finally she did enter puberty and what a relief it had been. Her chest became tender as her breasts budded, even as the first sparse dusting of hair sprouted at the base of her cock. Her balls dropped and her cock grew, but so did her breasts and she went from being frightened of her body to accepting it once again. Besides, as embarrassing as it had been getting a boner in class from time to time, she had learned to enjoy her cock by the time she had graduated high school and went to college. True she hadn't had any luck finding a boyfriend in college, but she had been so busy studying and trying to get good grades that her social life had suffered a little. Her cock had not nothing to do with it though.<br />
<br />
So, looking back she realized that she was fine with who she was.<br />
<br />
Jessica was looking expectantly at her and she smiled, &quot;Not really. Believe it or not, I'm fine the way I am. How about you? Why don't you change yourself some how if you're so big on wanting to change someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned the question back on her friend, curious what Jessica would have to say. She stopped short of suggesting that Jessica give herself a cock and balls, but it was tempting with how interested Jessica was in hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Jessica tapped her finger against the computer desk, staring at the screen, &quot;Maybe I will. Any suggestions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again Jessica had brought things back to her and again she was tempted to blurt out the first thing that came into her head, the suggestion that Jessica grow a cock and balls, but she stopped herself. There was no sense in limiting herself to that sort of thing and honestly, having a cock and balls wasn't all that interesting, at least not in her opinion, especially not when the machine could do all sorts of other crazy things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got nothing,&quot; she said at last, &quot;I'm happy being me and I guess I'm not as interested in changing things as you are. If you want to change yourself I can't think of any suggestions for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; Jessica shrugged as she stared at the computer, &quot;I was just wondering if you wanted to get in on the fun, that's all. I am going to change myself, I just haven't decided how yet. Even though I can make as many changes as I like and undo all of them, I want the first one I try on myself to be as fun as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at it that way Nikki could understand. What would she do to herself to make things more fun or at least more interesting? She wasn't sure, but if Jessica thought of something really good that might give her some ideas too.<br />
<br />
Jessica went silent as she clicked though the different menus, scrolling down to see what options there were. Nikki watched over her shoulder, hoping to see one that would catch her attention, but most of them seemed weird to her, especially all the animal options. Those ones really creeped her out and she hoped that Jessica wouldn't choose one of them. Much to her relief Jessica clicked away from them and moved on to the next set of menus. This one made Jessica burst out into a fit of giggles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's too out there,&quot; she laughed, pointing one of them out to Nikki, &quot;And with the other options for messing with reality that one should be a real riot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki looked at it, her eyes going wide when she realized the implications, &quot;So this one lets you duplicate body parts, put them in different places or turn parts from one sort to another?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like it,&quot; Jessica smiled wickedly, &quot;I'm going to try it. I'll set it so that you and I are the only ones who know and then we can go shopping. I want to see if people really won't notice something as wild as what I've got in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Nikki asked, curious about what had her friend so excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't look,&quot; Jessica said, waving her away, &quot;You'll find out soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment and some rapid fire clicking later, Jessica pushed away from the computer desk, &quot;All done. I set it so the changes will take an hour and you and I are the only ones who will notice. That should let us go shopping and stop for lunch on the way back while they're happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Nikki hurried off to finish getting dressed, picking out a nice orange top, because she liked warm colors, and a pair of rather tight fitting jeans. They were a little uncomfortable, but she kind of liked the way they were just tight enough to show off the bulge of her cock and balls. Being a part of who she was, she saw no sense in hiding what she had going on, to the contrary, she was proud of her endowments.<br />
<br />
When she was done getting dressed she went back to the living room and looked Jessica up and down, hoping to see some indication of what was going to happen, but nothing was visible yet.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Jessica licked her lips, &quot;Nothing yet, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, nothing I can see,&quot; Nikki said after a while, &quot;Are you going to give me a hint at least?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Jessica giggled, licking her lips again, &quot;I don't feel anything different yet either so there's probably nothing to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki continued to watch Jessica as they got into her car and drove to the grocery store. The trip there was only about ten minutes, but it by the end of it she was sure that there was something slightly different about Jessica's face. her lips looked, not exactly fuller, but maybe softer, and it looked a little like she was frowning, though that may have been her imagination. Not knowing what she was looking for and only able to see Jessica's face as Jessica drove meant that there may have been far larger changes happening elsewhere that she was still unaware of.<br />
<br />
As she parked the car Jessica gave a small smile and licked her lips, &quot;I'm starting to feel it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
For good measure she leaned over and looked at herself in the rear view mirror, &quot;Yup. I can sort of see it, can you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned to Nikki and while Nikki could see a slight difference, she wasn't able to put her finger on exactly what it was that she was seeing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't know what it is yet?&quot; Jessica laughed, &quot;I guess I shouldn't be surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Together they got out of the car and went to do their shopping. Since each had their own shopping list they each grabbed a shopping cart and split up, which Nikki was fine with. When she next saw Jessica that should help to make even slight changes more obvious.<br />
<br />
Checking off each item as she went she went up and down the aisles until she had found everything she needed. Most of what she had gotten had been fresh fruit and vegetables since she was more fond of cooking than Jessica. She figured that Jessica would get plenty of junk food and pre-made stuff on her own, besides, if they were going to be having lunch out she saw no reason to purchase any meat or fish. She at least was on a budget and stuff like that was a bit expensive to be buying when she was going to be treating herself to lunch.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, when she met up with Jessica in the checkout line the changes to her face were obvious, though she still wasn't sure what they were adding up to. Around her mouth Jessica's face looked slightly puffy and her mouth itself was looking decidedly odd. At first Nikki thought it looked smaller, but when Jessica looked at her and stuck tongue out she saw that it looked more like her mouth had shifted to open vertically. Her lips also looked puffy and very soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figured it out yet?&quot; Jessica laughed as they paid for their groceries.<br />
<br />
Nikki shook her head, &quot;Not yet. I get the feeling I should know what I'm seeing, but I just can't put my finger on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason this made Jessica laugh, &quot;I guess it's because it's something you probably don't see in person very often. That's a hint by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn't much of a hint though...or was it? She took a closer look at her friend's face, especially at her lips, so soft looking and slightly wrinkled. Nikki wasn't about to blurt it out in the store, but once they got to the car she had to ask. She had to be mistaken though, because why on earth would Jessica do a thing like that to herself?<br />
<br />
She finished paying for the groceries as fast as she could and hurried back to the car. As soon as they were both in and the doors were closed she stared at Jessica, wondering if she was mistaken, but in the end she still had to ask, &quot;Did you make your mouth a pussy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica took out her cellphone and looked at the time, &quot;It's only been thirty minutes so far, so not yet. In another half hour it will be though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica's half changed mouth twitched slightly, lips parting in a small smile, &quot;Chris really loves it when I suck his cock and I like it too, but I got to wondering if there was a way I could make it even more fun for both of us. Not to mention, I've always wanted to do something really crazy like walk around naked in public, and this is sort of like that, except no one will care.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was a lot for Nikki to take in at once. Clearly there was a side to her friend that she had never known about. They drove in silence, Nikki occasionally glancing at her friend's changing face until they arrived at the burger joint that Jessica had decided to eat at.<br />
<br />
The waitress seated them without so much as batting an eye, even though Jessica's lips had grown softer and drooped down slightly, looking more like a pussy than a mouth at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Jessica muttered to herself as she looked over the menu, her lips pressing together and then parting slightly, &quot;What do I waah?&quot;<br />
<br />
The last word was slightly slurred and she stopped to lick her lips, delicate pink tongue darting out and flicking over the soft folds of her lips, leaving them glistening with moisture. Her eyes went wide when her tongue brushed against the upper most part of her mouth, &quot;Ooh, tha feels good. Look an tell me waah you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting down her menu Jessica carefully parted her lips, revealing the unmistakable little pink nub of a clit. Nikki's wide eyed stare much have been all the answer she was looking for because she let go of her lips and they parted slightly in a smile, &quot;Thought so. Buh tell me, you like whaah you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki shook her head, &quot;I think it's creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just because she used a pocket pussy to pleasure herself didn't mean that she had any interest in the real thing. In fact, seeing an actual pussy up close like that made her decide without a doubt that she was straight. Honestly, she thought it looked disgusting, with its soft, gently sagging folds all glistening with moisture and seeing how small an actual clit was made her feel bad for other girls. Now more than ever she was thankful for her cock and balls. The idea of going through life with a moist slit where here cock and balls should be turned her stomach and she could never imagine what sex would be like when a clit was so tiny. How did you stimulate something that little?<br />
<br />
Jessica rolled her eyes, &quot;Suit yourself. Have you decided what you're going to order?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki's stomach was churning from the sight of her friend's face and food was the farthest thing from her mind. In fact, she had no clue if she would be able to eat without throwing up. When they left the restaurant she was going to ask Jessica if she'd be willing to change her face back to normal. The idea of sharing the house with her when she looked like that seemed like something out of a nightmare.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later the waitress came back to take their orders. Nikki quietly asked for a salad and a glass of water and Jessica ordered a burger and milkshake, her words slurring more than ever as the changes to her mouth neared completion.<br />
<br />
Unaware of Nikki's disgust, when their drinks arrived Jessica eagerly took the straw of her milk shake into her mouth and took a sip, her eyes closed in pleasure as she sucked on the straw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thaa waah goo,&quot; she sighed, her lips glistening with moisture, &quot;Aah caa waith for thaah buhguh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki had to look away when the burger came, staring resolutely at her salad and trying to ignore the sort wet munching sounds and small sighs coming from Jessica. When Nikki finally dared look up Jessica was blotting her mouth dry on a napkin, &quot;Foh ah geff we 'ay a heah 'ome ow?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was nearly impossible for Nikki to understand what she was saying, but she got the general idea.<br />
<br />
They paid and left the restaurant, Nikki still not able to bring herself to look at Jessica's face. She had barely picked at her salad and she was still afraid that she might lose what little lunch she had eaten if she looked at her friend.<br />
<br />
Making matters worse Jessica's phone rang on the way home and she was stuck listening to moist sighs and wet smacking noises as Jessica talked to her boyfriend, Chris. Somehow it seemed that he was able to understand her since the conversation went on for the whole ride home.<br />
<br />
When they finally got back Nikki all but jumped from the car and started unpacking the groceries to get away from Jessica.<br />
<br />
As soon as she could she was going to say something about what Jessica had done to herself and hopefully convince herself to change back to normal or come up with some less horrible change for herself.</p>
