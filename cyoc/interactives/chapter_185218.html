<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This came to my head while I was working on the Rhonda and Sofia branch.

<br />
Aubrey Chambers&#39; ambitions had been grand, but they never included &#39;last normal woman on Earth&#39;.<br />
<br />
As she sat perched atop the balcony of what had once been a quaint apartment complex, though, that was the status she seemed to have earned. The seventh sunset she&#39;d witnessed since that fateful day was capping off the week in which, out of nowhere, her entire life - civilization as she knew it, <i>humanity</i> as she knew it, had been wiped out. Suffocated by a pink cloud that converted all it touched into mindless bimbos, nearly-industructible, obsessed with sex, completely relentless in converting others to be like them.<br />
<br />
All except for Aubrey.<br />
<br />
Exactly why she was immune was a complete mystery to the redhead. While everyone around her had devolved into blonde, giant-titted sluts, she&#39;d remained exactly the same. She&#39;d walked through hordes of bimbos, only to be ignored completely; she&#39;d breathed in the gas so many times, and it had done nothing to her. For whatever reason, the affliction that had so rapidly spread over the world had deemed her fit to remain the sole rational, unchanged human being wandering what seemed to now be a cursed world.<br />
<br />
She had spent the time trying to remain scientific. Studying the infected, in the hopes of at least understanding how they worked. In many ways, they seemed to be like their old selves, still following certain behaviors and patterns - now just with a decidedly erotic element. And it was this observation, confirmed over the past several days, that had led her to go out on a limb in one last, hopeful shot at... fuck, like she even had any idea anymore. Even as she&#39;d been marching up to the building, Aubrey had known the chances were nonexistent. But she had to check.<br />
<br />
For a long time before all this, there&#39;d been a girl Aubrey was head over heels for. Terri, an adorable, nervous, bespectaled freshman who Aubrey had a crush on from the moment she laid eyes on her. She was smart, introverted, so very clearly struggling to see her own inner beauty - every time they shared a class, she made the redhead&#39;s heart go crazy. So many times, she had found herself too anxious to say anything, too lovesick to do anything but hope that Terri made the first move. Now...<br />
<br />
Now, she was hoping, wondering, if maybe Terri had been lucky enough to be immune too. If not... maybe she&#39;d still be in her apartment. Maybe she could see her crush one last time before... well.<br />
<br />
Hadn&#39;t been here when she&#39;d gotten up to Terri&#39;s unit and waltzed in through an open front door. All the day, she&#39;d been making herself feel at home, taking stock of what was left inside, what she could salvage and scavenge. Bimbos didn&#39;t need to eat or drink or sleep, but she did. This seemed like a decent enough place to hunker down if Terri didn&#39;t show up, at least, complete with some food and bottled water she&#39;d been able to restock herself with. If nothing else, it&#39;d be a warm place to sleep tonight before Aubrey set off in the morning to try and figure out her next move.<br />
<br />
It was as she was contemplating the California sunset that a noise was heard behind her. Footsteps, of the ditzy and poorly-coordinated variety. With every step, her heart beat faster, as she begged inside her head for it to just be some random woman, some bimbo who ignored her like all the rest seemed to. That it wouldn&#39;t have those eyes she was in love with, that the swollen lips wouldn&#39;t be the same lips she had spent so much time fantasizing about kissing. But hope, as they say, is a four-letter word.<br />
<br />
Tears were coming down her face the instant that Terri spotted her and shouted her name, rushing forward to huge her. She could do little but cry in confusion as those fat lips crushed into her own, the feeling of joy she ought to have felt completely absent. The girl she had wanted so badly rambled at her for a solid minute, babbling about bit titties and being hot, before finally, even her vapid brain seemed to piece together that something wasn&#39;t right. &quot;Aubrey?&quot; she asked in a sweet voice, one hand having stopped in trying to unbutton the redhead&#39;s shirt. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Do you want me to be sexier?&quot;<br />
<br />
The silent tears started erupting into sobs of anguish. &quot;Of course not!&quot; She pulled away from the confused bimbo&#39;s embrace, sliding down against a wall. &quot;I wanted you!&quot; she choked out, &quot;You were so pretty, and smart, and I never told you, and now you...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But... but I was ugly, and nerdy, and I was short and kinda pudgy and my boobs were so small, and I had those awful glasses...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I loved you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face was buried in her knees as she brought them up, arms wrapped around them as all the stress, all the strain of seeing everything collapse around her, it finally beat her down. Broke her. The pain in her gut, it was too much, far past what she could bear. Her hand fumbled off towards her bag, towards the gun that she&#39;d been carrying around for self-defense. Now... now all she wanted was to just end it. She wanted, more desperately than anything, screaming within her soul, not to hurt anymore. <br />
<br />
Even this was put to a stop as Terri grabbed her arm, forcing her to look up at the bimbo that the woman she adored had become. &quot;Don&#39;t hurt yourself!&quot; she whined, using her other hand to grab the gun away and hurl it off the balcony. &quot;You&#39;re perfect! Perfect people shouldn&#39;t never ever ever ever hurt themselves!&quot;<br />
<br />
Something broke through the haze of her misery. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m...&quot; None of the sex-crazed people she met ever so much as glanced at her. Almost like some ethereal force was keeping them away, saving her for... something else, almost. Someone else. Someone who... &quot;Terri...&quot; It couldn&#39;t be. &quot;I... you...&quot;<br />
<br />
She was quited by a finger on her lips. &quot;I always thought you were the most perfectest girl ever,&quot; Terri said, her affection and adoration clear even through her idiot-level speech patterns. &quot;That&#39;s why I took that beauty potion and set all this off. I wanted to be perfect for you too. And now there&#39;s a whole world of perfect girls you get to live in!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like the universe was playing some cruel joke on her. The existential horror of it all came crashing down - somehow, this girl she so dearly desired had felt the same way. And somehow, it had all spiraled into destroying the world as they&#39;d known it. Her mind snapped as the tears were renewed. That... that was why she hadn&#39;t been changed, hadn&#39;t been ravaged by the bimbos. The source of all this was standing right in front of her - and she hadn&#39;t thought a single thing about Aubrey needed to be changed.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, if she wasn&#39;t cracking under it all, she might have been able to use this to save everyone. Maybe in another version of these events, she would have thought to manipulate it, to influence the magic Terri stood at the center of to undo all this harm. But in that moment, as she felt her sanity vanishing, all she could do was grab Terri and sob uncontrollably at her. &quot;I&#39;m not perfect!&quot; She screched. &quot;I! Am! Not! Perfect! YOU&#39;RE pefect, you dumb bitch! YOU! You were ALWAYS perfect!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of looking hurt, Terri only seemed to become excited. &quot;You... you mean... I&#39;m perfect?&quot; She grinned. &quot;Well, then I&#39;ll make you perfect too, and we&#39;ll be perfect together!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aubrey&#39;s eyes went wide as she realized how her words had been interpeted, but it was already too late. She could feel it suddenly, creeping into her, soaking in through the skin. And... she didn&#39;t fight it. What was the point? Why try and hold onto herself in this doomed world? No, no, that was ridiculous. There was nothing left. Nothing but bimbos now... and Aubrey was tired of being alone. Tired of the bleakness of what her existence had become. She just... she just wanted to be happy with the girl she&#39;d been lovesick for.<br />
<br />
And oh, did she feel good as the pink energy coursed through her. Warm. Pleasured. Like her whole body was being lovingly caressed. Clothes seemed to fall away, discarded with ease, as she felt the magic fill her bosom and buttocks. Swelling her up to luscious curves, filling her lips as they met Terri&#39;s. Fiery red hair taking on a platinum blonde sheet, falling all around her in a silky blanket. Skin smoothing out. Massive pairs of tits smashing against each other. Facts vacated her mind, education being replaced with boiling lust... and with something more emotional, more affectionate.<br />
<br />
It was vocalized as she felt her mind slipping away, the heaviness and worry that had plagued her vanishing completely. &quot;Terri...&quot; She cupped her hands around the other blonde&#39;s face, holding her tight as glossed-over eyes met. &quot;I love you.&quot; She swore she could hear Terri&#39;s heart fluttering as she dragged Aubrey to the ground, desperate to make sweet love to the girl that she had torn down the entire human race for.<br />
<br />
Right then, nothing so grand or horrifying was on Aubrey&#39;s mind. She was just... happy.</p>
