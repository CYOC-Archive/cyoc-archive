<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yo!&quot; I heard over my shoulder. Scotty Ontaro came running up from the locker room and wrapped his arm around me. The big quarterback looked up at Ethan. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got a little guppy tagging along with you today.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Knock it off,&quot; Ethan pried the jock off my shoulders. &quot;He wanted to see the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Is that all?&quot; Scotty mocked. I felt my face burn again. Then forced myself to look away. The QB obviously knew I had a bit of the hots for him as well. His handsome athletic body was all the rage with women. Even if he wasn&#39;t completely cut, he didn&#39;t have a ton of fat covering his muscles. It was just enough to make him look a bit bigger without looking fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ethan said firmly. <br />
<br />
Scotty rolled his eyes. &quot;Alright man. Whatever,&quot; then trotted off into the gym. <br />
<br />
&quot;That guy...&quot; Ethan muttered. Then looked down at me and gave me an audible, &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
I had my notebook out, already writing something down. &#39;Scotty Ontaro will join us for our workout. Every time he insults me or Ethan at the gym, he loses 5% of his weight and 1% of his height. All of the weight transfer goes to me as pure muscle. No one, other than me, will notice anything changing.&#39; The notebook glowed and then that glow diminished.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really going to bring that around with us?&quot; Ethan asked.<br />
<br />
I nodded. &quot;Notes,&quot; I quickly added. &quot;And maybe progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan sighed. Especially when he saw Scotty coming back towards us. &quot;Ready big guy?&quot; Scotty grabbed at Ethan&#39;s extra weight and shook it. I could already feel the transfer happening. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the condescending way he said &#39;big guy&#39; or the act of grabbing Ethan&#39;s side, but I knew for sure the notebook was working.<br />
<br />
A small grunt escaped me as I felt some new muscle adding onto me. My thin 130 pound body was rapidly growing a bit larger and wider than it had been. I could feel my bones starting to stretch longer and my shoulders grew wider. A bit of muscle added onto my frame defining my figure just a little bit more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no Scotty,&quot; Ethan crossed his arms against his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Scotty shot back. &quot;Scared I might outlift you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh shit...&#39; I muttered as I felt another wave of muscle start to pack onto my body. I hadn&#39;t thought that Scotty would be this aggressive about it. The medium shirt I wore started clinging to my body. Even if it had only been two insults, the amount of change was rapidly becoming too much for my clothing. The shirt started to rise ever so slightly as a bit of abs showed out of the bottom of my shirt. My shoes were starting to feel cramped and small. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ethan stated. &quot;I just--&quot;<br />
<br />
I needed to cut this squabble short. I&#39;d be growing out of my clothes before we even started working out. &quot;You know what? It&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan eyed me suspiciously. That&#39;s when Scotty&#39;s arm reached around my shoulders and pulled me into a half hug. &quot;Yeah man, little to this little guy,&quot; he said. I felt another surge of growth overcome my body. The near 5 inches that had been between us felt barely like a half of an inch anymore. While I had been growing, he was obviously shrinking. I&#39;d never seen eye to eye with Steven before, but I sure was about to now. <br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s brow still raised, &quot;you sure?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I nodded. Then turned to Scotty. &quot;It&#39;ll be good to have two experts instead of one. How much do you weigh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Gay little fag wants to know?&quot; Scotty bragged. I almost wondered if that was worth two as our heights switched and I was actively looking down at him now. It didn&#39;t help that my shirt was really starting to strain now and there was a clear rift between that and my shorts. My lower set of abs was on full display and even a cursorily glance I could see just how tight they were. Same with my biceps. Even without flexing I could see they were almost softball sized. <br />
<br />
&quot;230 pounds as of this morning,&quot; Scotty answered. &quot;And 6&#39;1&quot; cause I know you gay guys really care about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ....&quot; I exclaimed. Scotty&#39;s face lit up as though I had just complimented him.  In reality I couldn&#39;t believe that he&#39;d couldn&#39;t finish an thought without an insult. My shirt was really starting to strain now. even the lightest bit of movement seemed to make the seams stretch. But I hadn&#39;t even noticed just how baggy Scotty&#39;s sleeveless shirt had been. He must have lost nearly 30 pounds along with 3.5 inches in height. The straps didn&#39;t hold onto his shoulders as they had, as his shoulders were far thinner than they had been.<br />
<br />
Scotty pulled up a flex. His much smaller bicep bounced. &quot;One day you might be as big as me,&quot; he continued to brag. It was a little bit awkward looking down at him in his much smaller body. However, his confidence didn&#39;t waver in the slightest. The flexing seemed to be another insult as I watched his body shrink even more. The tall peak of the muscle dwindled. It was true of the rest of his body as flattened out. His pecs weren&#39;t nearly as large nor were his shoulders wide. He had to readjust the strings on his shorts so they wouldn&#39;t fall down around his ankles.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile my shirt was really starting to strain. Even the slightest bit of movement made it sound like it was going to rip. A rift was forming even larger between my shorts and shirt. Not to mention just how tight my shoes were starting to feel. My feet were unbelievably cramped inside them. I let out a bit of a groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on little guy,&quot; Scotty pat me on the back. &quot;I&#39;ll show you how a real athlete works out. Ethan&#39;s a bit better in the cafeteria than in the gym.&quot; He whispered the last line not so subtly, but again poked the linebacker in the belly. <br />
<br />
&#39;Three more insults?!&#39; My shirt couldn&#39;t hold my growing body anymore. It ripped from my back and sleeves. Massive biceps pressed hard against the fabric and my wide shoulders were big enough to tear it completely apart. It fell away from my chest, revealing two thick muscular pecs where a flat chest had been. I couldn&#39;t see over them. Instead I had to use the mirror to see the six abs that were tightly woven underneath my new chest. <br />
<br />
Ethan grabbed Scotty by the shoulder. He pulled a bit harder than he meant to, throwing the smaller guy around. Not that either seemed to notice. &quot;Could you not?&quot; he hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Scotty still feigned innocence. &quot;Afraid I might take your little boyfriend away from you? Hmm?&quot; He looked up and down Ethan then shot me a wink with a wry smile. It was obviously meant to be a joke. But it was also an insult.<br />
<br />
I felt it in my body as it grew more. My shoulders widened while my waist stayed relatively the same. If not for my growing pelvic bone to help maintain my height, I knew it would have stayed just as thin. But stranger still was I was closer to Ethan&#39;s height than Scotty&#39;s. I was actively looking down at the other man who was shorter than when all of this started. His body still had a little bit of muscle, but that was rapidly deteriorating as he spoke. <br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s hands turned into fists and I pulled him back. &quot;Chill out,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
A look from Scottie was enough to set Ethan off. &quot;He&#39;s not my boyfriend!&quot; Ethan shouted. The gym paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay man. Whatever you say,&quot; Scottie shrugged.<br />
<br />
How that was an insult, I wasn&#39;t really sure. I could feel my muscles starting to grow more. Blood pumped faster through my body as I inched even closer to Ethan&#39;s 6&#39;6&quot; height. I was bigger than Scottie when we started and he was smaller than me. I couldn&#39;t believe the amount of muscle and strength building on my frame.<br />
<br />
Then Scottie had to go and continue. &quot;We all know who&#39;s on bottom and who&#39;s on top.&quot; He then nudged me with his elbow. Anger seethed out of Ethan&#39;s face. I had to hold him back. It was hard as I felt my body pulsing even larger. Any remnants of my shoes were gone as my feet had completely torn them asunder. I was now taller than Ethan, but instead of his imposing bulk, I had a lean bodybuilder physique stretched out over a towering body. I pulled Ethan back to the locker room.<br />
<br />
Scottie had to throw one more insult at us before we left. &quot;Have fun with your boyfriend for me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s fucking wrong with that guy!?&quot; Ethan paced around the locker room as he tried to calm himself down. &quot;I&#39;m sorry your first gym experience was so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; I had to duck to properly use the mirror in the locker room. The top half of my head was cut off. &quot;We can just try again later.&quot; I went back to the book and quickly wrote that &#39;Scottie can&#39;t donate anymore of his size to me.&#39; I was hoping that would be enough. I still hadn&#39;t tried erasing anything in the book yet. I didn&#39;t know the consequences for that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Ethan agreed.<br />
<br />
We walked past the gym to see Scottie flirting with some girls. Even though he was half his original size, he still had all the confidence and charisma from before. And since I made it so no one else noticed either, the girl was surprisingly into it. A bit of a smile crossed my face as I thought what to do next.</p>
