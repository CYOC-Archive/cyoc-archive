<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She cried miserably, stuck on that couch with about four hundred and seventy five extra pounds on her. Her beautiful body nothing more than a blob of unsightly fat. It was crushing her, all her muscles had faded, and she could barely breathe. Even crying was hard, her vision feeling heavy and tired.<br />
<br />
“No,” she panted. “I won’t let him win!”<br />
<br />
She strained forward, her bones creaking, the couch groaning, and her legs wobbling. She strained her eyes, panting, her body demanding she give up. She pushed through it though, inch by inch, strain by strain until she rose to her feet, exhausted from the effort. She panted in place, needing a nap from just that one movement.<br />
<br />
“One,” she panted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Lana panted as she shakily wobbled her way across the apartment, every step making the floor creak and groan like she was going to break through it, sweat poured off her body, all her excess fat jiggled and hurt as it bounced, and her legs screamed in pain. She made it to the other side of the apartment though and wheezed for air, red in the face and feeling like she was about to pass out.<br />
<br />
She then inhaled deeply and turned, starting her slow waddle back across the apartment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 3<br />
<br />
<br />
She panted on the second floor of the stairwell, she’d promised herself to see the fresh air that day, people stared at her in disgust as they walked past her on the stairs and she felt immense embarrassment, desiring nothing but to hide herself from the world.<br />
<br />
She caught her breath and started the painful process of descending those last few steps. Down and down and down with eyes repulsed by her form, but finally she broke from the building and stepped outside into the fresh air, rain fell from the sky and cooled her head. She stretched her arms out and inhaled deeply, taking in the beautiful smell of fresh air.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 7<br />
<br />
<br />
She panted as she walked down the trail, a gargantuan woman three times the size of everyone around her. She couldn’t run, it just wasn’t possible, but she still moved forward, one step at a time, she gulped down water and tried her best to ignore the stares of those around her.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 22<br />
<br />
<br />
Her lap was done, she was finally done that miserable walk around one of the campus trails, she could get out of the rain and go inside. She halted at the start of the trail and looked back and forth between her dorm building and the trail before exhaling deeply and walking towards the trail for one more lap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 30<br />
<br />
<br />
She chopped up carrots in her kitchen, one slice after another, making a small bowl of carrots and celery for lunch. As she chopped the door was swung open and her roommate Mason’s girlfriend Janette entered in a nice evening dress that framed her sexy body. Mason met her and they laughed together before departing somewhere for lunch, not needing to watch what they ate as much.<br />
<br />
Lana started to cry but scrunched up her face and glared forward, picking up a carrot stick and biting into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 48<br />
<br />
<br />
The guys in the gym were laughing as she walked back and forth with weights in her hands. Everyone laughed at her, it was funny to see someone fat exercising. She couldn’t even touch her toes and yet she was expecting to lose weight? What a loser.<br />
<br />
Lana tried to ignore them, walking back and forth and building up a sweat, working harder and longer than anyone in that gym, they just couldn’t see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 77<br />
<br />
<br />
Not even the cold could stop her morning jog, huffing along the trails early in the morning, she bounded along, feeling pretty good about herself, less people meant less pointing and staring aimed her way. She passed the trail marker and kept going. She was on a roll, why stop there?<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 93<br />
<br />
<br />
Girls giggled as she pulled her new clothing off the racks. They could laugh all they wanted as she purchased super xl workout gear, her old clothes were too big now, even seeing skinny framed girls jeering at her couldn’t destroy her confidence that day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 100<br />
<br />
<br />
Lana lay on her bed, lifting her leg up and down after a long workout, her eyes pinned to a book. She was exhausted but felt accomplished. She’d just decided to run double her usual run on a whim. It had just felt right, she wasn’t sore or throbbing either, just tired and feeling good in the afterglow of her workout.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 135<br />
<br />
<br />
She pumped weights upwards in furious reps, up and down, up and down. The guys laughed because she wasn’t lifting that much, but it was the motion she was after, not some number to impress her buddies. She pressed on, sweat rolling down her face as she worked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 136<br />
<br />
<br />
“And now breathe,” her yoga video instructed and she followed its instructions, holding her pose a little longer. Her breathing felt stronger, her lungs less wheezy. She continued to stretch out her muscles, work on her breathing, and calm her mind. It get good, she liked it, and she was glad she could move enough to perform it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 178<br />
<br />
<br />
Her fists thundered into the sandbag, taking out all her rage on it with powerful punches in rapid fire sets of ten. She was on autopilot, whacking the thing over and over when she lifted her leg and landed a kick. It was a movement she felt sore over but blinked at. She could kick again, a wild wave of joy filled her body before she gave a yell and delivered another kick, then another.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 200<br />
<br />
<br />
She lay on her apartment floor doing sit-ups, working her core until it hurt when her roommate Stella came back from the store and paused in front of her.<br />
<br />
“Your shirt is loose again,” she pointed out before continuing on her way. Lana literally couldn’t stop smiling.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 245<br />
<br />
<br />
The guy had stared at her during her entire workout on the cycle, she was expecting his snicker and elbow of his buddies but as she walked past he grinned at her stupidly and said. “You have a cut butt.”<br />
<br />
She blushed hard and stood in the change room, eying her shrinking backside, her beautiful rear end starting to become prominent again. She bit her lip and giggled girlishly to herself, unable to hide her blush as she left the gym.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 300<br />
<br />
<br />
“So anyway I’ve been into history books lately,” Lana explained to the guy across the table from her. She was done up in a nice casual outfit with her hair curled while he stared at her with a smile on his face from across the table, his hair spiked up a little. The date was going pretty well, the movie had been good and dinner out was always a treat. She was thinking of maybe meeting up with him again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 330<br />
<br />
<br />
“One hundred ninety eight... one hundred ninety nine... TWO HUNDRED!” The guys in the gym cheered as she beat the basketball captain’s record with a final upwards thrust of that weighted bar. She slid out from under the weights and popped a hip out.<br />
<br />
“Alright boys, pay up, I know you all betted against me,” she ordered and the guys handed her clusters of bills and coins while she wiped her chin off with her towel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 364<br />
<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” her boyfriend grunted as he thrust into her, making her breasts bounce and her teeth sink into her lip.<br />
<br />
She wrapped her strong thighs around her torso and he continued to jump her, bringing them both closer to an orgasm. Harder, harder, faster, and with bliss her mind exploded as his dick let loose a stream of cum that mixed with the juices of her own orgasm. He panted in place, his slightly flabby belly bouncing as he breathed.<br />
<br />
“God,” he groaned, rolling over to lay down next to her. “I’m sorry, I should have been able to go way longer.”<br />
<br />
“That was your best yet, you’ll get there if you keep trying. How bout this, if you can finish our run in under an hour tomorrow I’ll let you try again before class,” she grinned.<br />
<br />
“Can’t say no to a rocking body like yours babe,” he replied before leaning over and kissing her forehead lovingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 365<br />
<br />
<br />
Dan and his friends burst from their class as a bundle of laughter, Dan waved them goodbye and began to walk through the campus grounds towards his dorm. A few people played frisbee, a couple was having a picnic, and you could hear guitars strumming.<br />
<br />
As he walked he happened to catch sight of a fine piece of ass on a yoga mat, like the type of ass you only get to see every so often. She was lithe, curvy, and toned with muscles, a perfect specimen of woman, the peak of fitness and definitely in need of some flirting.<br />
<br />
He brushed his shirt off, he’d gained another freshman fifteen. Probably all the beer and partying, but what did he care, men could still be attractive if they were a little weightier, women though, they needed to keep their instruments toned.<br />
<br />
“Hey cutie, am I interrupting your workout?” He asked smugly before she turned and his voice caught in his throat. The girl he’d been watching stood up tall and glared at him. It was Lana, but that was impossible, he’d cursed her to be couch ridden. She was back to being thin and muscular, in fact she looked more athletic, fit, and beautiful than before.<br />
<br />
“Why if it isn’t what’s his nuts,” Lana grinned, stepping off her mat and stalking towards Dan who fell on his butt and tried to scramble away.<br />
<br />
“My curse wasn’t supposed to wear off,” he complained.<br />
<br />
“It didn’t,” she replied with her gaze growing even more venomous. “I worked off every single fucking pound.”<br />
<br />
“Ah! What was that curse again,” he whimpered.<br />
<br />
“Oh it won’t work even if you memorize it, I found your book and a lot like it, did a little studying this last year, learned a few tricks,” she raised her hand threateningly. “Now it’s my turn.”<br />
<br />
With that she snapped her fingers.</p>
