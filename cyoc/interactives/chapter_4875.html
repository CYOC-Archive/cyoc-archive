<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was a little worried now.  She had tried to take it back, but she could tell that Liz was mad.  And now Liz could have her way with her.  Not wanting to delay and be stuck with both, Jennifer blurted out, &quot;Transform!&quot;  Her reply amazed herself as much as it amazed her friends.  &quot;Wait, no!&quot;  Jamie shouted, &quot;It's too late Jenn!  You can't change once you've picked!&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz reared her head back with surprise and laughed.  &quot;Well alright, then Jenn.  I was going to dare you from making comments about my sex life, you know, to be nice like Jamie, but now I have a better idea.  Transform into Dylan, complete with Dylan's sexual urges and likes, but keep your own mind, and I'll show you who does the wrapping!&quot;  Jennifer screamed, &quot;NOOOO!&quot; but it was too late.<br />
<br />
She suddenly felt very light headed.  She glanced down and noticed that her breasts were slowly deflating.  Soon they had reached her previously generous D cup, but they didn't stop there.  In a few seconds her chest was as flat as the girls she liked to pick on.  She could feel her long blonde hair creeping up her back and shoulders, as it shortened to the cropped look that Dylan wore.  She also saw out of the corner of her eye that the blonde was being replaced with dark brown.  <br />
<br />
As her friends watched in awe, her waist began to expand, going from the petite size of her own to the male size of 31.  As her waist expanded, her hips retracted inward.  Changing from the feminine oval shape they possessed, they cruched inward causing a moderate amount of pain as they did.  Her ass also lost its feminine appearance, losing its roundness and flattening.  <br />
<br />
Muscles began appearing on her chest and in her abs, muscles that resembled Dylan's.  Her shoulders broadened considerably, expanding outward to those that would be found on any athlete.  Her arms and legs also added muscle, as they changed from being thin and toned to wide and muscular.  Small bicep bulges began appearing in her upper arms, growing slightly bigger to Dylan's size.  Her hands and feet also lost their petiteness becoming thicker and masculine.  Her nails retracted into her hands until they had no lenght past the tip of the fingers.  The color from her fingernails and toenails also disappeared, replaced with normal skin tone color.<br />
<br />
Hair began sprouting over her body.  It wasn't a considerable amount of body hair, but it was certainly much more than had been there a minute ago.  It came in thickest on her chest, where it was dark brown like that of the newly short hair on her head.  Now her head and face changed too.  Her neck had thickened with her shoulders and now the outlines of an Adam's apple was visible on her throat.  Her lips lost her fullness, becoming thin like a man's.  Her jaw and cheeks, much like her ass, lost their roundness.  They became thicker and angular.  Her nose turned slightly upwards.  It too, broadened like the rest of her body had already done.  The lashes on her eyes shortened, and her eyebrows thickened.  Hair now appeared inside of her newly masculine ears, growing into the long sideburns that Dylan sported.  Her face began to contort slowly as it molded itself into that of Dylan's.  Suddenly she let out a plea of &quot;Oh make it stop.&quot;  Her friends gasped in amazement.  &quot;That sounded exactly like Dylan!&quot; Liz exclaimed.  <br />
<br />
It wouldn't stop just yet though.  Anyone could tell that.  Jennifer suddenly felt a pulsing in her pussy.  She looked down at it to try and figure out what was wrong.  If she hadn't still felt so light-headed she would have known exactly what was happening.  Her reproductive system was rearranging itself.  First her ovaries swelled out of her vagina.  They quickly dropped down, one to each side, and took on the appearance of testicles within a scrotum.  Then came the final step.  Her clit followed in suit, swelling out of her slit, closing it in the process.  It swelled outward, and as it did, it took the shape of a penis.  The head formed, pushing its way out farther.  It kept swelling and lengthening, gaining width as much as length.  Trish and Jamie were astonished with its girth.  Liz, of course, was not, having seen it plenty of times.  What astonished her was how well this curse worked.  She looked at the changes that were finishing, and where only a minute ago her friend had stood, she now saw her boyfriend.  <br />
<br />
Jennifer's new cock grew out to a full 8 inches of length, and hung loosely from her groin, surrounded by her two new testicles.  The physical changes were now complete.  Jennifer was, to all outward appearances, Dylan.  Some of the jabs of pain had caused her to stand up.  Now exhausted, she sat back down, and tried to collect herself.  This gave time for the mental changes to take place.  The wording of Liz's curse had said that Jennifer would keep her own mind, meaning she would still know who she was, but she would gain Dylan's sexual urges and likes, meaning she would immediately want to jump on Liz and begin pumping away at the shorn pussy Dylan loved so much.<br />
<br />
That was how Liz had wanted it.  While she knew that Jennifer didn't really mean anything by her joke, she felt she could exact a little justice thanks to this curse.  And she get some sexual pleasure out of it too.  Who wouldn't take advantage of that.<br />
<br />
Jennifer regained her composure.  Liz began cooing at her.  &quot;Jennifer,&quot; she said.  Jennifer looked up at Liz and a strange look came over her face.  It was a combined look of shock, as if she hadn't expected to find three gorgeous, naked girls sitting near her, and satisfaction, with seeing her girlfriend sitting directly in front of her.  Almost immediately her new cock sprang to life, easily visible to the other three girls.  Trish and Jamie were almost tempted to jump on their friend before Liz could, but both knew Jennifer would go right for Liz.  As Jennifer's cock hardened, growing even further, Trish muttered, &quot;Damn!&quot; in acknowledgment that her own boyfriend Greg couldn't compete with that.<br />
<br />
Jennifer now sprang up from her seat and grabbed Liz by the shoulders standing Liz up from where she was sitting.  Liz contined to coo, &quot;Now let me show you who has the power.  Fuck me.  Slow and hard.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn't help but comply.  Even though this wasn't a dare, which it almost seemed to be, Jennifer was going to do what Liz told her.  Trish and Jamie were both wondering why.  The answer was simple.  While Dylan like to swagger around in public with an extremely macho persona, he was very kind, sweet, and gentle when he was alone with Liz.  He also pandered to her every sexual need.  If his friends ever knew this, he'd never live it down.  But he really had no choice.  He very much cared for Liz, most likely loved her but had never said it, and he was smart enough to know that if Liz wasn't satisfied, she wouldn't put out for him either.  That's what Liz had meant by having Dylan wrapped around her finger.  She didn't like to brag about it, for she did love Dylan and would never embarrass him.  Outside of sex, there relationship was very much about honesty and respect.  But she dominated him completely when it did come down to sex.  Now she was just demonstrating it to her three closest friends.<br />
<br />
Jennifer, in her now muscular, masculine form, laid on top of Liz's eagerly awaiting body.  She took her now 11 inch long cock, and entered Liz just as she had asked--slow, but hard.  Jennifer began to make sharp thrusting movements with her pelvis, pausing in between each one for a second or two.  With each thrust, her cock found its way deeper into Liz's pussy.  Liz was enjoying every second of this.  She loved to have Dylan slowly bring her to climax.  That way she could savor every second of passion, and ensure that he didn't shoot his load before she was ready to come.  Eventually, the pauses became shorter.  That was the way Liz had Dylan fuck her, and so that was how Jennifer was fucking her now.  <br />
<br />
Trish and Jamie were still looking on in awe.  They both fully realized just how powerful this curse could be.  And both found themselves being turned on as well.  Jamie broke eye contact from the action in front of her, to glance up at Trish.  She was curious to see if Trish was being turned on as she and Liz had been before.  Trish could not take her eyes off the sex happening in front of her.  She became completely transfixed by how much pleasure Liz was drawing from Jennifer's fucking.  At the same time she was becoming envious that Greg, her boyfriend, didn't cater to her needs as much as Dylan obviously catered to Liz.  The next time we fuck, she thought, I'll make sure he satisfies me the way I want to be.  <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, it got to the point where there was no pausing between Jennifer's thrusts.  Liz had started moaning softly when Jennifer had increased her pace, and now she was practically wailing with carnal delight.  At last she let out a scream of pleasure, and she came as much as she ever had before.  Her climax was made all the more monumental by the fact that Jennifer shot her load at the exact same time.  For a few brief seconds they remained motionless, Jennifer on top of Liz, both covered in sweat, both of them with their mouths wide open, frozen in a mixture of pleasure and awe.  Finally Jennifer pulled out of her friend, her cock still dripping wet.  Liz's pussy was very moist as well, and for a brief second Trish was tempted to lap up all the juices.  But self control got the better of her.  <br />
<br />
A few more minutes passed without anyone speaking.  Finally Jamie glanced down at her watch again, and stated plainly, &quot;It's 12:00 now.&quot;  This snapped the other three back into reality.  Jennifer and Liz had still been in a state a sexual euphoria, while Trish was in a daydream, picturing herself being pleasured as much as Liz had been.  &quot;Well where are we now?&quot; Jennifer asked.  It was the first time she spoke clearly in Dylan's voice.  It truly was an exact copy, as Liz told Trish and Jamie.  Jamie replied, &quot;Well we all passed the curse back to you.  So now you get to give it to one of us.&quot;  &quot;Oh, right.&quot; Jennifer said exhaustedly.  But before she spoke of the curse, she looked at Liz and said, &quot;I'll never question your sex life again.&quot;  Liz smiled and said, &quot;That was my goal.  Maybe this time you'll live up to your word.&quot;  Jennifer smiled.  Her friends knew her too well.  She usually never lived up to a promise of this kind.  But this had certainly been a day of strange things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let me think.  Ah, I think I've got one.&quot;  She turned to Jamie.  &quot;I'm going to ask you.  Pick 'transform,' just trust me on this.  Jamie thought for a second.  She had eliminated any jealousy that Jennifer might have for her.  She felt at ease with her friend.  &quot;OK.  I will,&quot; was her reply.  Jennifer smiled and said &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;</p>
