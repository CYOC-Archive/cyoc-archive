<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was an exciting game…for most of the boys. John seemed to have gotten the least of what he wanted. He had been the oldest boy in the group, and now he was the youngest. He felt humiliated being carried as a two year old in his now thirty year old brother’s arms and was jealous of his maturity. As Paul put the dice into his tiny toddler hands, he dreamed of aging up into a muscular version of himself.<br />
<br />
It didn’t help that Paul seemed to be obliviously milking this for all it was worth. “That’s it, little bro!” Paul cheered John on. John couldn’t tell if he was trying to humiliate him more or if he really found this fun.<br />
<br />
The dice themselves gave him a pretty good role. He felt a sense of toddler excitement as he watched his figure move multiple spaces, but it was all crushed as he landed on another negative space.<br />
<br />
John welled up to cry yet again, realizing he was losing one more year from his age. He was now the youngest the game would let him be. He watch as his toddler clothes warped into a cute blue onesie, an even fluffier diaper, and little baby booties in baby blue. He had sparse baby hair and was even smaller than before, easily cradled in Paul’s arm.<br />
<br />
“Woo,” Paul said. “So cute! Never knew I’d be able to hold my big brother as a baby! At least he is a little lighter than before! Can you still understand me, Baby John?”<br />
<br />
John very much could, and while he was somewhat distracted by the general attention span his new state was causing, he mustered the strength to stick his tongue out in disapproval. His speech skills were limited now, he found it hard to do anything but babble while he waiting for his next turn. At least there was nowhere but up from here.<br />
<br />
Paul squished the front of John’s diaper. “Oh dear, I don’t know how, but it seems he’s gotten even wetter.”<br />
<br />
John’s little baby face grew redder. He…laid…corrected again. Not only was he a baby, but he was peeing his diaper without even realizing it. His next turn couldn’t come soon enough.<br />
<br />
Paul picked up the dice from the floor. “Welp, let’s see were I’m going now,” he said. “Am I joining you youngsters or becoming a grandpa for you all?” He rolled the dice, and they all watched as his figure once again moved to a positive space.<br />
<br />
“How does he keep getting older,” Ellis said, “While I’m stuck learning my ABCs again?”<br />
<br />
“Lucky, I guess,” Paul said as the circle’s mist revealed a +10. “Wow! Thanks for inviting me, Jack! Growing older is fun!”<br />
<br />
It was odd for the other boys to watch as the childlike Paul grew from a man to an older man. He was wide-eyed and carefree as he watched himself age, keeping his head of hair and getting slightly grayer, keeping his muscle definition but looking a bit rougher for wear, gaining a few wrinkles around his eyes, and seeing the pants he still wore turn into leather. As he finished off his age up, he was the first to see some body modification appear. A large tattoo appeared on his right forearm, black flames going up to his shoulder bone. Then, he felt a few pinches as piercings appeared on his body, one on each of his nipples, and one…under his pants.<br />
<br />
Paul’s childlike admiration of his body was washed from his face. He didn’t feel angry about his changes like John did, just confused. He felt something odd in his crotch.<br />
<br />
“Could you hold my brother?” Paul approached his fellow adult-sized friend Bob and carefully passed John over to him. Paul then made a beeline for the bathroom. When he returned a few moments later, he made an announcement to the group.<br />
<br />
“Adults are weird,” he said, taking the baby John back into his arms.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” With Jack’s trajectory, he might be as old as Paul was soon. He needed to know what the bathroom trip was about.<br />
<br />
“I hope I don’t actually look like this when I’m older,” Paul said. “I went to the bathroom cause I felt something…weird. When I unzipped my pants, I saw that there was a…metal ring through my…penis.”<br />
<br />
Now it was Paul’s turn to turn beet red.<br />
<br />
“Like an earring,” Ellis asked, “but for your peepee?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah,” Paul replied, cradling his brother. “I guess so.”<br />
<br />
“Woah,” Jack said in wonder. After a moments pause, he called out. “I wanna see!”<br />
<br />
“What? No!” Paul replied. “That’s my private part!”<br />
<br />
“It’s not like it’s really yours, Paul, you’re in a different body…” Jack tried to bargain with Paul, but was cut off by Ellis.<br />
<br />
“If you want to see a peepee earring,” Ellis said, “grow up and get yourself one. In the meantime, it’s my turn.”<br />
<br />
Ellis bent over and grabbed the dice from the board, immediately throwing it back. He didn’t get to move more than a few spaces, but this time, he made it onto a positive space.<br />
<br />
“Bueno!” Ellis said. “I’m tired being young.” He watched as the circle gave him a +14. “Ha! Finally back to my muscle bod.”<br />
<br />
He watched as he changed once again to being a teenager, then older until he was a year older than his first change. His muscles came back, his scruff returned, and he was a bit hairier than before. He even had a well-kept mustache above his lip. He didn’t try and hide himself as he rubbed his new adult bulge, even pulling out the front of his pants to look at his crotch.<br />
<br />
“Ha,” Ellis laughed. “Looks like nineteen-year-old me doesn’t wear undies. Also looks like I’ve stayed away from penis earrings.” He chuckled to himself. “So far I’m growing into a normal man that would make my mother proud.”<br />
<br />
“Haha,” Paul said unenthusiastically. “You may be nineteen, Ellis, but I’m still technically old enough to be your dad.”<br />
<br />
“For now,” Ellis said. “I’m on the up and up!” He readjusted himself in his pair of tight fitting jeans.<br />
<br />
Bob noticed how Ellis’ bulge now seemed to extend into his pants leg. “Glad to see that I’m not the only one with that issue.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Ellis said. “It’s making me feel weird, like…hot.”<br />
<br />
“This is exactly why I’m tired being an adult,” Bob said, reaching for the dice.<br />
<br />
“Trust me,” Jack said, “it’s the same when you are a teenager.”<br />
<br />
“I hope I get a minus fifteen, I feel so weird in this adult body,” Bob said throwing the dice on the board. The moderate amount of spaces he moved landed him on a negative space. “Awesome! Now, back to childhood, please!”<br />
<br />
But Bob wasn’t that lucky, only getting a -6 taken off his age. “Well, it’s better than nothing,” Bob said. John, still listening along, stuck his tongue out and dribbled spit, seemingly in disagreement.<br />
<br />
Bob descended in age, losing some of the definition of his musculature, his bushy red body hair also fading. By the time he was down to nineteen, his hair was mostly located in his pits and, to his dismay, his pubes. The hair on the top of his head also grew shaggier, giving him a grown out bowl cut look.<br />
<br />
“Hey look, Bob,” Ellis exclaimed. “We made it to the same age!”<br />
<br />
Bob loosened up a bit at the mention of that. “That’s true. At least one of my friends is my age for the moment. That’s good.”<br />
<br />
“What is making you so uncomfortable, compadre?” Ellis put his arm around Bob’s shirtless shoulders.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, this body just seems like…not me,” Bob said. “Can’t put my finger on exactly why.”<br />
<br />
“Hopefully I can roll high enough to join you!” Jack eagerly picked up the dice and shook them in his hands. “Come on game! Don’t fail me now! I want plus six so I can join my friends!”<br />
<br />
He through the dice down, seeing that he was only moving three spaces…onto a negative.<br />
<br />
“What! How?! By how much!” The thirteen-year-old started to throw a tantrum as the circle reveled he would be moving -4 years in age.<br />
<br />
“Back to my original age?! Come on!” Jack yelled at the top of his lungs, making a fool of himself. He shrunk down to being nine, where he was when he started, no way to get himself to be big and strong like his friends. “This! Sucks!”<br />
<br />
“Like I said, it’s just a game,” Paul said. “It’s not my favorite thing to have metal through my nipples and…things. But that’s part of the fun. Pros and cons to each age. Very educational, in my opinion.”<br />
<br />
“Well, how am I supposed to learn if…”<br />
<br />
Jack was interrupted by a noise coming up the stairs; the unmistakeable sound of his father’s footsteps on the stair. Jack had been yelling so loud, he didn’t hear him coming in.<br />
<br />
“Jack,” his father said as he approached his door. “I’m home early. Who are you yelling at?”<br />
<br />
He looked at his friends, all severely changed by the effects of the game. It was too late to find hiding spots. How was he going to explain this?</p>
