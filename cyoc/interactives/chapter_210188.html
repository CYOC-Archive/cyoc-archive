<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Krentol for the help!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Szrel’s government issued van pulled into an open parking space and Master, Szrel, and a well-dressed Arabic-looking man got out. <br />
<br />
Szrel led the small group up to the elevator. As he approached, Szrel spied Davis, one of his co-workers, standing guard outside of it. He wondered if Davis was going to be a problem. Szrel hoped not. He liked Davis, but Master had no time for fools. If Davis stepped out of line…Szrel shivered, remembering the punishments Master liked to dole out to those who got in his way.<br />
<br />
“Who goes-Oh! Hey Szrel!” Davis cheerfully waved them all forward. He nodded to Szrel’s Master. “It is a pleasure to meet you, Sir. Szrel told me all about you!”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. I suppose it is a pleasure to meet you as well…” Master trailed off.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Davis, Sir.” Davis stuttered, pointing at his name-tag. “Normally, I’d shake your hand. But COVID regulations and whatnot…”<br />
<br />
“Yes, the human-engineered plague. Though you didn’t hear that from me.” Master smiled, a rare reaction.<br />
<br />
Szrel’s heart leapt. Maybe Master would spare Davis! He wasn’t all that important to the plan. Perhaps make him into another kobold like Szrel? That would not be so bad…<br />
<br />
“I have to say,” Davis began, “we really have come a long way.  Back when I was a kid, I don’t think anyone would have expected that a kobold would be allowed to leave its master’s den, but now here we are with a kobold for a US Marshal!”<br />
<br />
“Yes I suppose…” came Master’s disinterested reply.<br />
<br />
As if sensing the lack of enthusiasm in Master’s voice, Davis said, “You should be proud of Szrel, he isn’t just a trailblazer among kobolds – he’s also one of the best Marshals on the force.  Its kobolds like him that make me sad there are still so many of his kind living such primitive lives.”<br />
<br />
The word primitive struck a cord in Szrel’s mind.  He remembered back to when he was a hatchling, being told of when kobolds were little more than food for their masters.  And it was that knowledge of how bestial his race used to be that caused Szrel to swell up with pride in knowing how well he’s been able to serve Master.  How Master knew his name and, to Szrel’s overwhelming joy, valued his life.<br />
<br />
“There’s a group of those a few miles from my house,” David continued, “they live such basic lives – I’m not even sure what they do for a living, but I don’t think they can afford many modern amenities.  <br />
<br />
“After all,” Davis’ voice grew hushed, “I see them out riding these giant foxes to the market.  Don’t get me wrong, they look fun to ride, but I don’t think they’re riding them for fun.”<br />
<br />
“Direfox, yes, make good mounts for kobolds in the old days,” Szrel yapped excitedly. “Sometimes Szrel want Direfox to ride in spare time.  Like fancy horse for human, but for kobold instead.”  <br />
Then some of the excitement faded from Szrel’s eyes, “but Szrel too buys serving Mas-er, serving with the US Marshalls for fun times.”<br />
<br />
“They do not have a Master?” Master mused, smoke puffing from his nostrils.<br />
<br />
“I don’t believe so, no.” Davis went red under Master’s stare.<br />
<br />
“That would explain it. They need a firm hand to direct them or they stay primitive.” Master nodded to himself.<br />
<br />
The elevator dinged and opened up and all four… people walked in. <br />
<br />
“Trial on top floor, Master.” Szrel said, hopping up and hitting the button for the top floor.<br />
<br />
Davis chuckled and hit a different floor. “Man, I’d love to see that trial. Magic and Books and stuff. Too bad I have to drop off the food in the cafeteria for the animal witnesses.”<br />
<br />
“How did they end up catching him?” Master asked as the doors closed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, one of the detectives for the Feds owns two Books. He’s there too.” Davis replied.<br />
<br />
“How lovely!” Master clapped his taloned hands. “This trip looks to be quite lucrative after all!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master!” Szrel yapped happily.<br />
<br />
“After this, I think I can definitely spare you some time to enjoy yourself, Szrel.” Master said, then turned to Davis. “Do you happen to know any of those kobolds that live near you?  Would it be possible for you to help Szrel get a Direfox?”<br />
<br />
“I wish I could,” Davis said before pausing in thought “but those kobolds don’t let anyone YIP!” Davis’ eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
Davis brought his hands to his mouth, to explore the strange wriggling black snout that was extending further into his field of vision as his muzzle grew. He yelped, seeing his fingers painlessly shorten, pulling up into his hands with little pops and crunches. His nails were becoming short, pointy claws while black fur covered his hands. <br />
<br />
Davis stared at Szrel in confusion, before a loud noise echoed through the elevator – “GRANTED!”<br />
<br />
Davis spun his vision to the Arabic man that had, until now, been silently watching from the corner of the elevator.  Fear permeated through Davis’ chest as his bewildered gaze met a cold stare.<br />
<br />
Davis could feel his ears stretching out and stiffening as they migrated upwards towards the top of his head.  The more Davis felt his body shift, the more frightened and confused he got.<br />
<br />
Eyes darting around the room, Davis desperately search for anything that could explain what was going on, before finally turning to look at the kobold’s Master for help. He watched as the Gold Dragonkin pulled out a Book, one he recognized as almost identical to the one in the trial on the top floor. In gold, shimmering letters, the title read: Book of Myth. <br />
<br />
“You were going to be helping Szrel out regardless, but it looks like your poor choice of words let my genie friend there beat me to the punch.” The Dragonkin smiled.<br />
<br />
Chiffee felt his hips crack and his stance wobbled, before catching himself with a padded paw against the side of the elevator. He felt something press painfully against the back of his pants, wriggling frantically. He tried to call out, but only broken words and YIPs fell from his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Szrel,” Master spoke, watching the tail wriggling around under the fabric of Chiffee’s ill-fitting pants. “Why don’t you go help your new mount out?”<br />
<br />
“Yes Master!” Szrel yapped as he circled around Chiffee. He paused and whispered in the direfox’s still-growing furred ear. “Szrel sorry, but you going to be changed anyways. You be happy, Szrel promise.”<br />
<br />
With a taloned hand, the kobold ripped Chiffee’s pants away, his big furry black tail poofing out behind him. Chiffee found himself wagging it in a manner that conveyed happiness, though that was not how he felt on the inside. <br />
<br />
Chiffee felt his paws slipping on the elevator’s slick metal wall.  He felt his body begin to move towards the floor, towards his new, more natural stances as a quadruped.  He tried all he could to lean into the elevator, to stay upright, to remain standing like… a human.  Some deep part of his mind told him to fight it.  It told him that it could beat the magic, that he could stay human.  That all he had to do was keep from falling to floor.  <br />
<br />
But Chiffee also knew that part of his brain was lying to him.  He knew that his body was being reshaped by forces beyond his ability to control, beyond his ability to comprehend.  He knew that he only had one possibility of hope, one possibility of salvation.  He focused his mind on the now awkward feeling muzzle that had replaced his mouth.  He opened his new appendage and, “Please YIP! Help YIP!” Chiffee tried to beg, but his mouth and tongue were working weirdly.  And worse yet, he was starting to forget words.<br />
<br />
Szrel ripped away the former human’s shirt, more fur floofing out as the direfox began to assume his final shape, chest deepening and broadening into a proper canine configuration. He could feel his mind beginning to slip, nothing really made sense anymore. The kobold carefully put pressure on Chiffee’s back and it popped painlessly, the direfox hitting the floor softly on padded paws.</p>
