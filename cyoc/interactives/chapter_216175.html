<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">How far she travelled, she didn&#39;t know. Her human find too far regressed to be able to calculate and measure distance, Jeff found her attention more on other things. When a predator was detected, she crouched low in an effort to make herself as small a target as possible, as a feral instinct took over and directed her. Finding this interesting, Jeff was also distracted by other things, like squatting to pee when she needed to relieve herself, how natural it felt to go about on four legs, and her sharpened senses which, besides alerting her to danger, informed her about the world around her.<br />
<br />
When she reached the edge of the city, she stopped and looked back. The part of her mind which was still human struggled to make sense of why she&#39;d come this far, and if she could ever find her way back. Whimpering low in her throat, she for a spit second again felt she&#39;d forgotten something, something to do with her being what she was now. But then a large object came zooming toward, and what she now was, a female fox, resurfaced and took control. Finding it uncomfortable to be so visible, and out not when she normally wouldn’t, Jeff whined a second time, couldn’t get her human mind to focus, and instead turned to flee. Heading out into the countryside, her mind on the need to find a den, a place she could mark as her own, someplace as safe as possible from predators, and where she might raise any young.<br />
<br />
Open land leaving her too visible, her movement was slow, cautious as she travelled. When she came to more wooded lands, she relaxed, but only a smidge. The part of her which was still human helped her to work out any danger, as well as food, and when she smelled another of her kind nearby, she paused, but then moved on. Not ready for a mate, as it&#39;d been a male, she continued deeper until she found a dry place her senses told her hadn&#39;t been used in some time. Squatting to mark it as her own, Jeff had a brief relapse when her human side resurfaced, and she found herself fascinated about how she no longer had a penis to pee, as well as the notion of letting forth a quick squirt marked the area as hers. Doing so over and over, Jeff would have found it even more interesting to know the total area she marked off as her territory was about five to six miles. But lacking any comprehension of such distance, sacrificed so her animal self could have more free reign, Jeff didn&#39;t give it any more thought than need be as she returned to what was marked as her den, climbed inside, curled up and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
Awoken some time later, Jeff at first couldn&#39;t put anything together. Unsure why she was in a cave, let alone why she thought of herself as female, these and other concerns gradually faded away as it came back to her she was now a fox. Instinct, the same which had woke her, caused her to tense as she sensed both it was a better time to be active, as well as there was something creeping about outside her den. Shifting her ears to better hear, her senses told her it was another of her kind, possibly the same one she&#39;d detected earlier. Her mind starting to war between the dominate animal and the diminished human, Jeff tried to work things out, but found it difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay? Want male?&quot; she wondered after some time, and making a connection to before when she had felt it wasn&#39;t time to mate she tried to figure out if what she&#39;d forgotten was to make sure her sexual preference was still for females and not for males.<br />
<br />
Finding it had to work out, she sensed the male had moved on and standing, she stepped out of her den. Looking about, the two parts of her mind still struggling to figure things out, her human mind had one more realisation, it being okay for her to be attracted to males since she was now female, before her animal mind reasserted itself. Looking about, not understanding the time was dusk, Jeff moved toward a specific spot and sniffed. Smelling both her urine and the male&#39;s pee, she squatted down and re-marked the spot. Glancing about, listening, smelling the air, finding everything was becoming clearer the darker it got, Jeff again sniffed at the ground before she set out. Letting her animal self and instincts direct her, she ranged far and wide, hunting, scouting, dodging predators, and keeping herself busy with one thing after another. Finding herself back at her den, she had no comprehension a whole night had passed as she crawled in.<br />
<br />
A quick check of the area, and finding it was still as she&#39;d left it, Jeff lay down. Curled up in a tight ball, tail wrapped around her, she drowsed. As she did, her mind drifted until a part of her still human returned and she once more was trying to understand why she felt like she&#39;d forgotten something. Feeling certain it was connected to the fact she&#39;d become a vixen and hadn&#39;t left her sexual preference for females, Jeff couldn&#39;t shake the feeling this wasn&#39;t it. Squeezing her eyes shut, she breathed deep through her nose and as she felt herself starting to drift off to sleep, she wondered, &quot;What not done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her human mind to far regressed to figure out at the moment, the sensation of something forgotten chased her into a light sleep. On alert for the first hint of danger, Jeff found herself lost in a confusion of dream images, first of warm furry body giving her nourishment as she competed with others, then a place she was sure she should know, but lacked the words to describe the things before her as she walked on two legs toward a specific object.&#8232;&#8232;Lit up, Jeff was cautious as she approached it, worried it could’ve been dangerous. Things, squiggles and lines, appeared, and trying to grasp what they meant, she was distracted when a voice cried out, “I’m telling mom your doing weird things on your computer,” and not understanding, Jeff spun around in place to see a two-legged creature.<br />
<br />
The world shrunk, and Jeff dropped to what her mind insisted was the more comfortable, natural four-legged stance as the one before her said something else. The noise it was making not meaning anything, Jeff crouched low and back with legs splayed, and when the other creature stepped closer, became two, the second taller, different somehow, Jeff felt her bladder release before she turned and fled. Running through a surreal landscape mixed of what she was used to and the strange place with the two, two-legged creatures and the objects she should have known the names for, she heard from behind her a familiar for, “Come back. You’ve forgotten. I can show you what,” and for a split second, she thought she knew the voice.<br />
<br />
But then the world melted away and with a start she awoke. The same confusion she’d felt almost twenty-four hours ago engulfed her brain and she was unable to make sense of anything. Standing, on edge, she looked wildly about. Her tail twitched in agitation, she bared her teeth at an unseen enemy. Finding none, she slunk outside the cave and finding it was almost dusk, for which she still did not have the words and comprehension to understand this was the time of day when the sun was setting, she pivoted her eyes, sniffed the air and scanned the surrounding area. Finding nothing to cause her to be the way she was, her animal mind slowly reasserting itself, Jeff pawed at the ground for a moment before her head snapped up. Something catching her attention, she was wary for a moment before she moved off, the oncoming night calling to her.</p>
