<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ooooooooohhhhhmmmmmmmmmm-uuuuhhhhhhh,&quot; Eric gave a rather heavy moan as he felt his erect penis erupt in orgasmic pleasure after a second bout of mating with Julie that afternoon and through fluttering eyes he could see his fiancée and true love shudder in pleasure as well.<br />
<br />
As both came down from that sexual high, Eric felt himself slide down to his side so that he could lay beside the young woman he loved so dearly. As he looked to her and saw her &quot;glow&quot; with the light that told weremers who their true love was, he couldn&#39;t help but smile and think on how so many things had changed and so rapidly. In many ways it was very different from where he was in his life a year ago, but he couldn&#39;t help but feel it was a good thing. Back then he had come off as very quiet, shy, and perhaps anti-social, likely the result of being bullied. Soon, as his father&#39;s extra-marital sexual exploits became known there was the growing thought and feeling that such things were trouble and to be avoided, which only reinforced the thoughts that he&#39;d had that would be considered shy and introverted. They were definitely reinforced as he began to learn more about were society after moving to Moon Lake and the fact it really wasn&#39;t hard for weres, once they&#39;d had their first transformation, to become aroused.<br />
<br />
But Julie had begun to change that. They had made friends at school, and while they didn&#39;t share any classes, and both took a heavy class load that meant that they didn&#39;t have a &quot;study hall&quot; period they were able to talk at lunch. The talks had been friendly and Julie was always nice to him and in many ways showed him how good things could be in Moon Lake. They rapidly began to stir feelings in Eric that he&#39;d never had before, and because of his past didn&#39;t know and couldn&#39;t recognize, and that was actual romantic feelings and love. She&#39;d invited him to a &quot;pool party&quot; to further help him get used to Moon Lake, only for him to learn that not only was Julie a weremermaid but that the whole party was just the two of them. She&#39;d done a lot for him and seemingly just for him.<br />
<br />
And those growing feelings of love lead Eric to where he was now, a young weremerman and deeply in love with his fiancée, the weremermaid who had transformed him. His thoughts and issues on sex were different than they had been, and while Eric truly wished to be a good gentleman for Julie and have their relationship be about more than sex, especially because they were both so young, he couldn&#39;t deny that he&#39;d felt the things he&#39;d read about and learned about weres when the family had first moved to Moon Lake. He found it pretty clear that it didn&#39;t take much to really get him interested, in that thoughts of Julie or them together was enough to earn some rise in him, and he&#39;d come to full attention when they&#39;d first gotten home earlier in the afternoon when Julie said she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra, which then lead to where they were now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wonderful,&quot; Eric said to her a very happy smile as Julie began to cuddle to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you,&quot; Julie smiled back, &quot;and I think we&#39;re both getting better...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt a small blush rise in his cheeks at that. Prior to Julie, he&#39;d never had anything close to a girlfriend in Minnesota. He&#39;d occasionally worked on some school projects with fellow students that were girls, but beyond getting the assignment done, he really paid them no real notice. Julie was a real girlfriend and the two of them had gone well beyond what most have expected from people their age, and Eric had the sensation that his parents might have some uneasiness with regard to him and sex as he was their youngest son. He even had some sensation that they weren&#39;t entirely easy with Nate being sexually active and Nate was two years older than him. But that was all something that related to a were&#39;s libido and was something that was bound to happen, especially if the were found the one they wished to ultimately marry when they grew up...<br />
<br />
But the fact that Julie was Eric&#39;s first and to his surprise that he was her first had meant that there was a level of clumsiness between them in their first interactions together. Eric had looked into some things, particularly as he became more and more aware of the fact that the growing bond between him and Julie seemed to mean that they might be pulled into a situation where that of thing may happen entirely by instinct rather than by choice, and that search had included an awkward conversation with his father. However, conversation and study was one thing, practice was another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Practice makes perfect, I guess,&quot; Eric managed recognizing the fact he was very different from where he was when his family first arrived in Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
Julie only smiled back at him, her bright blue eyes, blond hair, and the joy she seemed to show was enough to make Eric&#39;s heart fill with passion and love. She was all that mattered to him and he couldn&#39;t wait until for when they finished college, married, and could move in together. Julie chuckled at the comment and moved to hug him when a male voice was heard echoing through the air vents in the Anderson home. It made both of them jump a little in Eric&#39;s bed and eventually, Julie rolled onto her other side and soon felt Eric slide up behind her. Eric then half laid on one elbow and half leaned over Julie&#39;s shoulder to try and listen as to what was heard.<br />
<br />
The voice was soft and faint, and they could only make out a few individual words every now and then. Many humans who became weres often commented on how their senses were enhanced by the transformation, particularly with their sense of hearing and smell, senses that humans naturally didn&#39;t rely on as much as they did with regard to sight. However, Eric had noticed certain things in his own transition into were society that was different. His sense of smell was better, and in fact far better, and he compared it to a shark&#39;s keen sense of smell, but his eyesight and hearing out of water really hadn&#39;t changed all that much. The point for him were those senses had improved was under water. His eyes weren&#39;t irritated by the water, which was why humans wore goggles while swimming or swam with their eyes closed. And his ears seemed to have adapt to understanding and hearing things underwater. He figured that for weremers that made the most sense. While they had a were-form in Stages 1 and 2 that could function well on land, they were a were species that most adapted to the water and thus many of their abilities would reflect being in the water, even if it meant not being quite as sharp with regard to hearing things outside of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it sounds like your dad,&quot; Julie said to him as she actually sat up.<br />
<br />
Eric soon sat up as well, &quot;he and mom must have gotten back while we were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Julie said to him, &quot;I mean... your whole family became weres...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was the last to join were society,&quot; Eric said slowly, &quot;and my dad was attacked and mom then HAD to change in order to stay with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;you&#39;re all weres. You&#39;ll all understand a were&#39;s urges and how easy they come to weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them soon began to put on the clothing that they&#39;d discarded when they&#39;d gotten home earlier in the afternoon and thankfully after they&#39;d finished their homework. Eric couldn&#39;t help but look over and watch as Julie pulled up her panties. He understood what Julie was talking about as he had felt it in himself since becoming a weremer and he was fairly sure his parents understood as soon after his parents became weres, he&#39;d noticed that they were being very passionate with each other, to a degree that they&#39;d never been at before even before issues that related to his father&#39;s past infidelity.<br />
<br />
&quot;They may understand it... and on some level they may ultimately accept it,&quot; Eric answered as he hopped up, pulling on his pants as he did so, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to be super comfortable with it... I mean... I don&#39;t think my folks would ever be up for anything like last night in the pool... with your parents there...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie gave a small giggle, &quot;A lot of that may simply be that your family is still adapting to Moon Lake. My mom&#39;s been a weremermaid for a long time and my dad was born a weremer. In that they could be rather open and informative with me... I didn&#39;t always think much on that issue of a were&#39;s libido, but I was aware on it and in full understanding of it. Your family&#39;s come from a world that doesn&#39;t really have that sort of openness really doesn&#39;t exist and at the same time tries to heavily impose things and expectations on people... I mean there are a LOT of people that have been trying block people like the Twists from having love together because &quot;God&quot; says so... It&#39;s a world very different from Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still doesn&#39;t mean I want to have sex in front of my parents,&quot; Eric said slowly, &quot;in fact... having sex in front of your parents was a bit... awkward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie managed a nod and to a degree agreed. While she and her mother had been able to openly talk about many things, there was the sensation that her parents had similar preferences to what Eric described with is parents. The main difference that Julie could tell was that her parents being far more used to Moon Lake and everything that came with it were far more willing to accept many of the things that made Moon Lake so different from other American towns. <br />
<br />
The two quietly dressed and left Eric&#39;s room. As they came out into the hallway, Eric moved over to take a look out toward the open door to his parents room. From what they could hear echoing through the vents, his father was somewhere downstairs, and likely in his study/office. However, from what he remembered, he and his mom were dropping of the lady friend that his mother had made, and had spent the night in the woods with both of them, which would mean that if his father was now home, his mother also had to be home. With a mix of curiosity and nervousness peaked into his parents found the bedroom empty and the bed made and the light to the bathroom wasn&#39;t on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone was listening,&quot; Eric said with some relief as he then turned back to Julie and moved to head downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe your mom is studying in the living room... or getting started on dinner,&quot; Julie commented thinking on some of the things said that morning at the local diner.<br />
<br />
The two made their way downstairs only to find the living room empty and there being no sounds coming from the kitchen. The only thing that they could hear were the muffled narration that William Anderson was giving as he went ever his plans for the next week. That lead them to following the sound of William&#39;s voice until they came to the doorway to the study, where they could see William Anderson calmly pacing and looking over a few notes he had. His briefcase lay open on the desk that dominated the center of the room. After a few moments he stopped and turned to see them and gave an appropriate greeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, you two,&quot; William spoke, &quot;I trust you had a good afternoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eric answered simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get all your homework done?&quot; William asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Julie said respectfully, &quot;we actually didn&#39;t have that much to finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; William gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dad... is... is mom home?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the moment...&quot; William said slowly, &quot;I don&#39;t think so. We did come home together... but as we arrived... Samantha came out from the Twist home and was visibly worried about Frances who wasn&#39;t home. Your mother then took Samantha to the hospital and I think she&#39;s probably still there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The hospital...&quot; Eric and Julie said together and both going somewhat pale. While the Stovalls weren&#39;t as close to the Twists as the Andersons were on a personal level, they were on good terms and Julie had met Frances Twist on occasion. Samantha&#39;s wife had seemed to her like a nice person and one Julie felt deserved a good and happy life with Samantha. Eric had similar nervous as Frances had informally talked with him a couple of times regarding his growing attraction to Julie and had been quite helpful. In that he kinda saw Frances as either a much older sister or a friendly aunt, and didn&#39;t want to see her hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s fine,&quot; William assured both of them, &quot;though I think Frances was possibly called in to help the hospital staff with something... particularly after what happened this morning. I&#39;m sure your mother will fill us in on the details when she gets home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Eric gave a visible sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... I have a bit more work to do with regard to getting next week&#39;s lessons readied,&quot; William gave a polite smile, &quot;why don&#39;t you go out and watch a little television or something. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be too much longer, and I&#39;ll get started on dinner when I finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric and Julie nodded and quietly made their way back to the living room. Eric hoped everything was fine for his neighbors and felt some degree of relief in that it didn&#39;t seem like his father had been listening in on him and Julie...</p>
