<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick thinks about how much he enjoyed having the hands of Hephaestus on him...in &quot;that way.&quot; In fact, he realizes that he likes Hephaestus quite a lot. He shakes his head to clear it, and he tries to take in the scent of the mares around him. He thinks about how pretty the mares are, and he hums nervously while trying to focus his mind on &quot;straight&quot; thoughts. No, it can&#39;t be...it can&#39;t be...but the more he thinks about it, the more he realizes that, while he likes the mares quite a lot, his true feelings toward them are ones of warmth and affection and perhaps a little bit of protectiveness. But lust? Not really as much as he thought. And then Derrick looks back at Hephaestus. He doesn&#39;t see the prettiness in him that he sees in the mares at all, but he keeps looking at the huge, toned chest of the god. For some reason, he feels a flush go through him whenever he sees it, and he starts thinking a lot about his own body. He flexes the muscles in his ass, and he thinks they are not bad-looking. However, he realizes he doesn&#39;t so much want Hephaestus to feel impressed with him as to...well, to like him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I&#39;m a handsome stallion?&quot; Derrick asks Hephaestus, posing to show off his muscles. The intonation of the question sounds a little bit like &quot;Do you like this dress on me?&quot; and it makes Derrick feel kind of nervous and silly to ask it in that way. However, he feels like he needs to know.<br />
<br />
Hephaestus nods appreciatively. &quot;You are as handsome a shire stallion as I could imagine, but how do you think I look?&quot; With those words, Hephaestus becomes a large, full-fledged Friesian stallion, himself, although the transformation is clean, without even so much as a puff of smoke. The change occurs in such a manner that it just seems that he has always been in the shape of a horse, and the image of a humanoid god is just a passing memory. As a Friesian stallion, Hephaestus is the same metallic gray as the metals in which he specializes as a god, his coat a beautifully soft shade of gray. As a Friesian, Hephaestus is more warrior-like than a shire, being slimmer, lighter, and more athletic. Unlike the shire, being chiefly a draft breed and relatively bulky, the Friesian is bred for action.<br />
<br />
Derrick immediately begins to drool at the sight of such a beautiful creature, and he finds his cock getting hard all over again, much to his embarrassment. If there was ever even a slight doubt he was gay, then that doubt is shot to shit now.  The savagely masculine creature speaks to every part of his mind. The breath catches in his throat, and his face goes red with his blush. Knowing the stallion is really a god...and one that has pleasured him so recently...makes every sexual part of the stallion scream out to his mind. &quot;I...I think...you&#39;re amazing. I want to...I love you...&quot; he finds himself saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you become a stallion, deep in your soul, in order to have me?&quot; asks the god.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; gasps Derrick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you give up having the mind of a human but instead be a brute animal that can be controlled by reward and punishment, knowing only pleasure and pain, fear and hunger, in order to have me?&quot; asks the god.<br />
<br />
Yes,&quot; Derrick says, his heart beating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then be transformed in body. From there, to purge the remaining humanity from your soul, give in to your brute bestial desires, and mate with me as an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick suddenly finds a membrane attached between his arms and his sides, and his flesh flows as they are merged into his sides. There is a colossal crunching and rearranging of his organs as they are simplified into merely being an enlarged horse&#39;s neck, and after a moment, he feels his skull being compacted and his jaw beginning to protrude as it is transformed into the head of a horse. With a fearful whinny, his transformation is completed.<br />
<br />
Still blazing with lust, he trots up to the god, who stands ready to receive him, and he rears up on his hindquarters, his mind enslaved by the fierce attractiveness of the other male, and his hindquarters surge forward, plunging his cock into Hephaestus&#39; butt. Grunting several times and whinnying aloud, he just barely manages to get shoved in past his medial ring as he begins to burst forth into a hot, blazing orgasm.<br />
<br />
As the orgasm washes over Derrick, he feels a sense of simplicity wash over him, and the sounds around him become echoic and obscure, although more clearly audible than before. He smells stallion. Since horses, like humans, can be gay, he realizes that he likes the stallion best, and he realizes that his cock is buried deep in the guts of an uncommonly beautiful one, His lip curls in a dumb horse-grin as he feels his balls emptying, and as his cock flops out, he dismounts off of his mate of the moment.<br />
<br />
Hephaestus, who had been successfully brought to orgasm also and whose cock hangs unabashedly under him, stands proudly as he looks at the newest member of his herd. Since shires tend to be very docile horses, Derrick will be most amazingly easy to control, and he will look beautiful dressed-up in full barding. &quot;What a pretty horse,&quot; he coos at his new possession. Derrick, not knowing any better, flushes under the praise, knowing his master approves of whatever it was that he did. He imagines that he might do it again sometime, whatever it was, since he is an obedient and well-loved horse. Oh...mating, yes. He will do that again. He likes mating and eating, and he likes his master to approve of him. He understands little else now.<br />
<br />
Hephaestus becomes a human-like god again, and he leads Derrick away to where the humanoid servants of Hephaestus can get him put into his barding. There are subjects waiting to see the god, and Hephaestus will be wanting to ride upon his new prize.</p>
