<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pyrithius saw what appeared to be a teenage woman huddled, and trying to keep warm, and she appeared to be freezing to death. Pyrithius approached the girl and she remained still, and stared at you,&quot;Excuse me girl, but why are you out in such a blizzard and not at home, where it is warm?&quot; Pyrithius asked, and the girl gave no response. Pyrithius then rushed up to her, and saw that she had symptoms of hypothermia badly, but she seemed to be able to move fine. &quot;Here I&#39;m taking you with me, you&#39;re going to die from the cold otherwise at this rate. If you don&#39;t come willingly I will carry you.&quot; Pyrithius said, and the girl motioned him closer, and she whispered,&quot;P....please...h..h...help.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment Pyrithius immediately took the girl into his arms, and made his way back to his cave with the girl in his arms. Pyrithius then layed the girl beside the fire pit, and lit a fire using his breath, and the wood inside. &quot;Here, wait here until I return. We need to get you into dry clothes, so I&#39;ll see what I can find for you.&quot; Pyrithius said, and the girl stared at him in awe as if she had seen a ghost. Nonetheless Pyrithius scrambled to find clothes, and pulled out something that he remembered making, but actually didn&#39;t. It was an animal skin suit that was basically unisex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here put this on, and get those wet clothes off your body, now! Your condition will worsen if you do not get everything even remotely wet off of you now.&quot; Pyrithius said, almost growling, and layed the clothes next to her. The girl them began undressing, and Pyrithius turned away in response when he first noticed her doing so. Pyrithius then felt a hand on his arm, and circled around to his claw hand, and touch it then back off. &quot;I assume you are finished dressing yourself, I hope that everything is fine by your standards.&quot; Pyrithius said turning around, and saw the girl fully dressed, and everything including her undergarments were laying on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y..you&#39;re...you&#39;re a...&quot; the girl began <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a dragon, was that what you were going to say. And no you are not my prisoner, or damsel those actions are merely fairytales. Ironic coming from a dragon I know.&quot; You said taking off your helmet, and laying it on the ground besides you.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; The girl continued <br />
<br />
&quot;Personally I do not know how I came to be, but I suggest you remain here until the storm passes at the very least. My name is Pyrithius, and all that matters is that you are safe, we should dry your clothes now.&quot; Pyrithius said,&quot;But the real question still remains, why were you alone in the middle of a blizzard, and away from any kind of society?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...My name is Ailitha, and I basically was rejected for marriage by a potential lover, and in response I ran away.&quot; The girl, Ailitha said <br />
<br />
Pyrithius paused, but then remembered the average human lifespan during the 11th century wasn&#39;t nearly as long as what he is used too, and shook his head and said,&quot;Apologise I sometimes get lost in thought. Anyways I believe you, but not completely, you ran off into a blizzard alone as a result from a marriage rejection.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was with him, he lives merely a few meters from my home when the blizzard began, and took shelter with him at his home.&quot; Ailitha said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess that, what you said proves your case. Anyways your clothes are set beside the fire to dry, and once your condition settles, you may use the hut with two beds inside however you wish. But for now getting warm is a priority overall.&quot; Pyrithius said <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you treating me so kindly?&quot; Ailitha asked<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? If it&#39;s because I&#39;m a dragon I hope you know that I don&#39;t like any of that fairytale nonsense.&quot; Pyrithius said <br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s just...nobody has treated me this nicely other than my mother, and you seem really nice overall, despite your personality, or what you make it out to be. Personally if you were human I&#39;d wish for you to be a potential husband. Everyone at home just claims to have wives that clean, and to pass on legacy through intimate means.&quot; Ailitha said <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I uhh, wow, nobody has ever really said anything about me like that.&quot; Pyrithius said and thought, for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you don&#39;t have to be so formal, you can take of your armor if you desire to.&quot; Ailitha said <br />
<br />
&quot;I would, but I doubt that you would understand my body as a whole, especially my uhh.... private areas.&quot; Pyrithius said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh it&#39;s fine then.&quot; Ailitha said <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just take off my chest piece, but I guess now we can converse with each other.&quot; Pyrithius said taking off his chest armor, and exposing his torso, which actually appeared to be rather muscular, and if dragons could have a six-pack he would.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, now let us sit and talk about each other.&quot; Pyrithius said, and he looked over to see Ailitha blushing. Pyrithius walked over, and sat down near the fire pit,&quot;Come here my scales generate heat, it will help you more than just sitting beside a fire.&quot; Pyrithius said, ans Ailitha sat down next to him, and put her arm around his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for saving me.&quot; Ailitha said <br />
<br />
&quot;Irony at it&#39;s finest, anyways allow me to tell you about myself. You already know who I am so I&#39;ll try to summarize what I can. I don&#39;t really know how a I originated as I said, my existence is as a mystery to you as is to me. Anyways throughout my entire life I was seen as sort of a threat, my age is unknown, but I think I have potential to live for thousands of years. I have seen human legends, and seeing you in distress made me think I has an opportunity to prove the world, and everything that lived in it a chance to believe that I am not bad, I am not evil, and I certainly am not a MONSTER!&quot; Pyrithius growled, and punched ground leaving a mark from where he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, you must think the same, like everyone I have met thus far, and everyone I will meet in the future which is already bad enough as it is.&quot; Pyrithius said <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait? Future, what do you mean? Your not a monster to me, you saved me, and told me I am free to leave when I wish to, no monster would do that at all.&quot; Ailitha said and you felt yourself blush<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really touching, please though tell me about your life.&quot; Pyrithius asked<br />
<br />
&quot;My life isn&#39;t special, it&#39;s just like every other woman who&#39;s ever lived, I mean I can not even believe I am talking to you in this manner. Like...for you humans accepting you is a fantasy, and the same can be said about me in a way, free will is not common for us women especially me.&quot; Ailitha said <br />
<br />
Pyrithius paused, and Ailitha said,&quot;For what it&#39;s worth I wish we could be together for all of those thousands of years, and living together too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just say that if there was a way you would? Because the thing is there is a way, but I&#39;ll only do it if you promise me that you will stay with me until death. Funny it sounds like I&#39;m a priest, but who would bless us?&quot; Pyrithius said <br />
<br />
&quot;Does it matter, if there is a way then I want it, and considering that dragons are already seen as the devil himself. I&#39;ll be glad to burn with you in those depths, for eternity even.&quot; Ailitha said <br />
<br />
&quot;You really want it... Fine, I&#39;ll tell you. The symbol on my chest is a mystery to me as my existence is to me as well, but the mark on my chest has the ability to transform any being into a female dragon version of themselves. Or at least I think it does, anyways my mark can do that, but only once, and I don&#39;t know how I know this, but I&#39;ve been saving it for a long time now. So I ask you now Ailitha, if you wish to become my mate now nod your head, otherwise say no.&quot; Pyrithius said.</p>
