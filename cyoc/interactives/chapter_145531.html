<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I was about to post this episode when I discovered &quot;A Moon Lake Fan&quot; posted the previous chapter. So with some editing (and a little cutting and pasting of a few of AMLF&#39;s passages to account for previous events...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Take me. NOW!&quot; Nichole told her husband in Tara Strange&#39;s living room, and he was more than happy to oblige.<br />
While there had been times when she had initiated sex between them, she had never truly been the aggressor before as she opened his pants just enough to reach her objective.<br />
Moe&#39;s eyes widened in surprise as she stroked his cock with one hand, even as she kicked off her shoes and started removing her lower clothing.<br />
Still dressed from the waist up, Nichole hovered over him just long enough to align his fleshy missile before sinking down upon his hard penis.<br />
Moe noted how wet his wife was, for she took all of him in one stroke, plunging his hard shaft as deeply into her as she could.<br />
Moe reached up and finished removing Nichole&#39;s top and bra so he could pleasure her bosom, even as she continued to ride him.<br />
<i>What&#39;s gotten into her?</i> he wondered. Then again, Moe really didn&#39;t care at that moment as he started moving  in return to give as good as he got.<br />
Realizing that he was getting closer to exploding within her, Moe turned.<br />
The Charlestons made the short (less than a foot) drop and landed on the rug next to the couch, but neither of them cared as Moe took advantage of now being on top to thrust into his wife with all his might.<br />
<i>Take me like my mate should when I&#39;m in heat!</i> Nichole silently urged her husband, even as she locked her legs around him to force Moe even deeper into her steamy moist cunt.<br />
Moe knew Nichole shuddered at least once before the end, but both enjoyed a mutual orgasm that seemed to last for all eternity before he collapsed on top of her.<br />
Nichole didn&#39;t mind his weight upon her, even as she felt her hard nipples rub against Moe&#39;s shirt covered chest.<br />
She got what she wanted and was happy, for the moment, as her legs collapsed onto the floor.<br />
<br />
When he finally caught his breath, Moe stared deeply into his wife&#39;s eyes and asked, &quot;So, not that I&#39;m complaining, but what brought this on?&quot;<br />
&quot;This,&quot; was Nichole&#39;s reply, reaching out to grab the Moon Lake Were Guide Book (as she called it) from where it fell before they had sex.<br />
&quot;Do you know that weres can live for up to 400 years?&quot; she asked. &quot;And while I still don&#39;t understand why there isn&#39;t any for the men, because all the species are VERY fertile, female weres have to take their respective birth control pills daily or else humanity could be overrun by weres within a generation or two at the most. Especially since, from what I&#39;ve read, sex seems to be a were&#39;s favorite past time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Moe said, his attention torn between Nichole&#39;s newly developed fascination with were society and the plain red covered book in her hand. &quot;Have you changed your mind about weres?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted his wife. &quot;I figured since Karen is going to join them, we should at least be more knowledgeable on the subject. While I still don&#39;t like this Mandatory Were Law*, I&#39;m beginning to understand our daughter&#39;s fascination with them.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; replied Moe. He wanted to get off his wife, but something other than the fact that his cock was still hard and deep within her stopped him from doing so. &quot;You do remember that if... someday, you want to join too, we&#39;d have to do it together.&quot; <i>Then again, what is it about the idea of you having fur that drives me wild?</i><br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go that far,&quot; said Nichole, denying how she felt at the moment. <i>Fuck me again darling! I&#39;m still in heat and long for you!</i> &quot;But I do think you should read this book too so we can be more versed on what Karen is getting into.&quot;<br />
&quot;That I&#39;ll agree with,&quot; said Moe, taking the book out of her hand and setting it down beside them. &quot;Now then, I think we still have some unfinished business.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? What?&quot; wondered Nichole, who was pleasantly surprised when Moe started thrusting into her as hard and as fast as he could. The fact that he was still dressed from the waist up didn&#39;t matter to him. All he cared about was giving his wife a great rutting.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; she screamed, locking her legs around Moe once more even as her body started to shudder in pleasure anew.<br />
Neither of them lasted for very long. Moe and Nichole both thought the other gasped, but that was the last thing either of them remembered before passing out from orgasmic bliss.<br />
When they awoke a few minutes later, Nichole stared deeply into her husband&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;I want to continue this conversation. I want you to continue fucking me like there&#39;s no tomorrow until your cock falls off! But I do think you&#39;re still over dressed and that we should resume our... discussion in the bedroom.&quot;<br />
A passionate kiss was Moe&#39;s only response before he reluctantly got up, his still hard penis longing to be back where it didn&#39;t want to leave.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
How long Karen Charleston sat in that chair, staring out the bedroom window, she couldn&#39;t say.<br />
Hearing her parents, and realizing what they were doing, brought her back to the present.<br />
Karen managed to pick herself up from her recent daydream and straightened her clothes.<br />
The fact there was a distinctive odor coming from her hand wasn&#39;t lost on Karen.<br />
She noted that the afternoon sun was in the sky, and figured that Peter would be home by now. She walked across her bedroom and opened her door. The first thing she noticed was a trail of clothes leading from the living room to the bedroom. Judging by the types of clothes on the floor, she figured her mom and dad were at it again. She started to pick up the trail of clothes, and when she got near her parent&#39;s bedroom, Karen could hear Nichole moaning in rhythm. Karen resisted the urge to open the bedroom door a crack and peek inside, and instead, left the clothes in a pile near the door. She made her way down to the kitchen where the phone was. Karen quickly looked up the number for the Brook residence and dialed the number on the phone.<br />
<br />
After talking to Peter Brooks**, Karen was more excited about meeting a werelion, the last were she needed to talk to before finalizing her decision on which feline to join were society as.<br />
Passing the closed master bedroom door again, Karen Charleston was surprised her folks were still at it.<br />
Her own wayward thoughts of sex, let alone becoming a feline based were, were driving her crazy with lust and desire.<br />
<i>I know weres will be out there will be doing it again tonight,</i> she realized. <i>I could easily slip out of the cabin again. But even if the were I want to be is in the woods tonight, the only way I could gain my fursona and not get pregnant in the process is with a female. Do I dare?</i> she asked herself, going back to her room to stare out the window again.<br />
<i>I promised my folks I would think this through carefully, and notify them of my decision before doing so. But even lacking a werelioness&#39; input, I want a fursona so badly! I want to be big, strong, and sexy. Beautiful enough to have any man desire me, but powerful enough so I can choose who I want to be with and not have some crazy idiot like Marcus Gamboni think they can claim me like property.</i><br />
<i>Even if I do dare defy my folks, can I risk taking matters into my own hands, or paws?</i> Karen asked herself, still staring out into the woods.<br />
<br />
TO BE CONTINUED...<br />
