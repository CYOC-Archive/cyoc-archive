<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From inside her handbag I heard Sarah unlocking the door to the flat. I felt her put her bag down. I heard the shower go on. Not once did she make an effort to pull either me or her knickers out of her bag. I was just left there. It was almost as though she was enjoying my predicament.<br />
<br />
Eventually Sarah reached into her handbag. She pulled out the dirty knickers and took them away. She didn&#39;t touch me though. I was left in her bag for a bit longer.<br />
<br />
It was later that evening when Sarah pulled me out of her bag. I was covered in fluff. She took a damp tissue and wiped me clean before putting me down on her bedside table for the night.<br />
<br />
It was early the next morning when Sarah&#39;s alarm went off. I knew her routine. She would get up, shower, have breakfast and get dressed. I would be one of the last things she would think of before she left the house to go to work. But I looked forward to when she did think about me and place me on her wrist.<br />
<br />
Eventually the time came. Sarah picked me up, casually, as though I could have been any inanimate object. She draped me over her left wrist and fed the clasp through the buckle. She took a brief look at me then gave her wrist a violent shake to move me where she wanted me to be. She then put her coat on and left, driving to work. As she drove I moved around slightly on her wrist, particularly when she was steering or changing gear. This was ridiculously arousing for me and yet I would never actually climax.<br />
<br />
Sarah worked in an outbound call centre. Once at work she hung her coat up on the back of her chair and sat at her desk, displaying me to the world. I wondered if anyone would notice her new watch, and if they did whether they would realise it was me. Of course it was silly to even think that anyone would recognise me as her watch. As she rested her hands on the desk in front of her I felt my bracelet on the wooden top of the desk and I simply looked straight up as I waited for Sarah to look at me again. The day was long and boring. Eventually lunch time came. Sarah got up and walked to the canteen where she sat down to eat her lunch. I could not see her eating her lunch but she reached into her handbag and pulled out an e-reader. As she held it in her left hand and read while eating I found myself being held up at an angle, still unable to see her. I looked out into the canteen, watching as her co-workers walked past. Eventually she twisted her wrist and glanced at me, her deep brown eyes momentarily locking onto my face. Sarah got up and walked back to her desk where she again sat down and resumed her work. I desperately craved her looking at me again, but she didn’t. She ignored me while she sat on the phone and typing at her computer. I felt myself being continually moved around as her hands moved over the keyboard. Despite this all I could think about was her looking at me and me being useful to her. Eventually the end of the day came and she drove home from work.<br />
<br />
Once home Sarah went to the bathroom where she washed her hands and face. As she did so she unclipped me from her wrist and dis-guarded me in the bathroom. When she was finished she left me there, alone, abandoned and unwanted. I savoured the scent coming from the kitchen as she cooked her dinner, knowing that I would never actually taste the food. She would usually leave me in the bathroom overnight before putting me on again the next day.<br />
<br />
Time went on. The weekday routine rarely varied much, unless she was on holiday. If she went away though she had a habit of either not taking me or leaving me locked in a hotel safe for the duration of the trip.<br />
<br />
At weekends I would only get worn if she had something going on or if she was going out with friends, or boyfriends. In fact, overall, it felt as if she had completely forgotten about me.<br />
<br />
Then, after about 3 years, for her birthday, her boyfriend gave her a new watch.<br />
<br />
Sarah was wearing me when she opened her present containing a new pink Apple watch. She took me off and discarded me on her boyfriend&#39;s coffee table. She put her new watch on. I seethed with jealousy. And I was fearful. This watch would do so much more than tell the time. It appeared that my time as her watch was over. Whatever happened now, whatever she decided to do, I was her old watch. From my position on her boyfriends living room table I watched the pair make out.</p>
