<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When patching Trevor back together....<br />
<br />
&quot;WHY DID YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT-?!&quot; Mary snarled at Serenity.  She finished <br />
patching up Trevor (she had been studying to be a vet after all) and changing his <br />
bandages. She had overheard her parents of course, the ears weren't just for show. <br />
<br />
Serenity was startled, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you have to tell them that? AFTER they made this -sacrifice- for -me-! They <br />
didn't want to make me human because they thought they'd be stealing who I was! They <br />
chose to adapt to me instead of the other way around-! How many parents do you know <br />
that would have done that?! AND YOU had to go and throw it all in their faces!!! I could <br />
have easily lied and told them that the blue wolf lady was mistaken and I was born a lion <br />
girl like they think and the whole world thinks!! I could have come up with a decent lie for <br />
what happened when I was cursed! But no! You! You had to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity was stunned, &quot;You -want- to remain a lion girl?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd have to have all my clothes customized for my tail, wearing shoes is a joke! I'll stand <br />
out like a sore thumb my entire life and look like those circus freaks in Russia who really <br />
do look like animal people! But my parents made a bigger sacrifice for me than I could <br />
have ever imagined! And I was more than willing to make a LITTLE sacrifice for them by <br />
lying! I don't want to take grade school all over again but I can likely skip a few grades if I <br />
try hard enough. I STILL don't know if my friends were altered by things or not or if I have <br />
new friends that I made in this version of reality the curse made! And my favorite stuffed <br />
animal whose been with me forever got his species changed too! But when I saw them <br />
defending me from those monsters I realized- I wouldn't MIND being this way as long as <br />
we were together!  I've had friends who some people would call 'unique' and less polite <br />
people would call 'freaks' but none of them gave up or gave in! I through!  This is my big <br />
middle claw to this stupid curse! Screw it! If Ulee' is stuck with wolf ears I might as well go <br />
around with cat ears!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Ulee'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;he was my best friend and I was tutoring him before his family moved away, or that was <br />
what I thought happened to him! He was the one who told me they were permanently <br />
wolves! Well! If he's stuck a wolf even if we get his head back ons straight then, then, <br />
then, then THEN---!&quot; The seven going on eight year old cat child shook, tears in her eyes <br />
as her muzzle quivered, &quot;THEN I WANNA STAY THIS WAY TOO!&quot; She practical tore her shirt <br />
and jeans off leaving her as naked as her parents.  &quot;You wanna see dis bad thing gone <br />
forever and 'ever? LET'S DO IT! But I'm stayin' in da pettin' zoo!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel sick to my stomach admitting it,&quot; Said a male voice, &quot;I mean, really feel sick, <br />
anymore sick I'd puke... but I've realized I can appreciate that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;TREVOR!&quot; Serenity declared happily, &quot;You're awake!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Technically yes, though I think the singing dancing plush toys in the corner would <br />
disagree... &quot; Trevor shook his head a couple more times, &quot;There, they're gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old woman and lion cup looked at each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor... thank you... you saved my parents... you saved me...you're the bravest cat I've <br />
ever known! What you did was so cool! A lion couldn't have done better!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor blushed, &quot;Mary. If you were some years older I'd ask you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary decided not to remind Trevor how long house cat's lived given Trevor's condition. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's very sweet, but you're two legs two extra of being my type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heard that one before.&quot; Trevor quipped back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure.&quot; Mary smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Serenity... what were the words whoever used to get you stuff as you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Madam Serenity said in the hardest not precise voice in existence. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay kiddo,&quot; Trevor said, &quot;I can tell you the wording the jackass used who cursed me <br />
instead, I'm stuck this way too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TREVOR!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Serenity, it's not like we're friends, and cats aren't known for loyalty, well, most, <br />
consider this my way of going against type and looking out for my fellow Felidae.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor this is escalation!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Serenity.&quot;  Trevor shook his head, &quot;But... I think ... for once, just this once... &quot;   <br />
Trevor told Mary the wording of his curse. Mary memorized it. Serenity ended up praying. <br />
<br />
Paul was keeping an eye out outside the house now that the mirrors were gone the <br />
wolves, if they decided to come back for Ashley, would have to come from the outside, or <br />
least that was what he hoped. He ignored his cracked ribs, he could get them set later <br />
once they were relatively in the clear. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Felicity left to greet the police officer coming in so he didn't freak out and draw his pistol <br />
first. <br />
<br />
Guarding the blue she wolf, Brian and Felicity looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting around is going to be hard isn't it for us honey? We're so tall...&quot; Felicity.<br />
<br />
Brian nodded, &quot;I didn't think we're end up so big... this could be trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so... I'm going to  have trouble not bumping my head in... well, any room <br />
really...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I was right about one thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mane is the most sexy thing I've seen in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brain could take consolation in that. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is why wolves are better.&quot; Ashley said gleefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shut up.&quot; Felicity snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pst! You're ugly, stupid, and impractical. We're still at least small enough to go around. <br />
How did we lose to clumsy things like you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be fair, we ARE more agile than you, and we have quicker reflexes to boot.&quot; Brain said. <br />
&quot;So save it, you're a criminal in our home and you threatened our pride. If we can't remove <br />
your brainwashing then you're going to jail.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We're the pack! They'll look out for me! So save it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy! Daddy! I wanna talk ta ya about somethin'.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two lions looked at see their cub with one arm around Lance standing in the door way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear you're naked.&quot; Felicity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you mommy and daddy. And so is Lance.&quot; Said the lion cub stroking the plush <br />
animal. <br />
<br />
The two giant lions looked at each other, and nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;You got BIG..&quot; Mary said in a voice mimicking innocent wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the Transform was for us to stand up to the wolves honey...&quot; Felicity said, &quot;It's to <br />
help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy... what Miss Serenity said...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... is it true dear?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary considering lying and acting like she didn't remember her past existence at all, but <br />
knew what Madam Serenity had told her parents that was impossible. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... &quot;<br />
<br />
Both lions shuddered finding out their memories were lies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey... after this is over I promise, we'll turn back and everything can go back to the <br />
way it was.&quot; Brian promised. <br />
<br />
Mary thought of Ulee'. &quot;I wanna stay dis' way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna you to stay dis' way too too!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two lions looked at each other, wonder if, what was said was true, if the game was <br />
effecting her like it clearly effected the wolf Ashley. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was a grown woman before.&quot; Mary lied, knowing her parents had no way of knowing, <br />
she hadn't mentioned her age to Serenity, and Judas wasn't one to be able to judge human <br />
except by size. No one would ever know except her.  &quot;I know it's hard for you to accept <br />
but... I WANT to be this way, I WANT TO STAY this way... and to be with you... &quot; She <br />
decided to leave out the part of Ulysses being a major factor in her choice.  &quot;And... if we're <br />
gonna gonna be a pride, a family, then let's BE a pride and family! Let's be dis' way for <br />
evah and evah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity sighed, &quot;Honey...  your life before...but can... you don't really...&quot; Being told all this <br />
confusing information made Felicity insure in spades, as did it in Brian. <br />
<br />
Ashley was blinking with wide eyed confusion. And a traitorous thought crept into her <br />
brain, 'Their bound... it's as unbreakable as ours?' <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor told me how he was stuck as a cat... and look around... our family pictures, the <br />
height of the ceiling, haven't ya wondered why you haven't needed to crotch and not bump <br />
da ceilin'? 'As we've always been.' That was part the transform I said... &quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed, their family pictures, their furniture, their doors... all of them, showed naked or <br />
almost naked lion people (Brian and Serenity still had their wedding rings though they <br />
were different sizes to fit their fingers). <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's be a pride and family forever and ever, let's show we're better than the big bad <br />
wolves and aren't savages and CAN live with humans.&quot; Mary said with sparkles nearly in <br />
her eyes that reflected then in the eyes of her parents who stared at her transfixed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey... if this what you want...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please~ daddy? Lance wants it too... All da police-mans who want to help can go back to <br />
the way they were before when we save everybody... &quot; <br />
<br />
Brian knelt down looking down at his child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mary... are you sure that's you talking and not-&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary licked her father's muzzle, &quot;Please~?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brain shuddered and went docile, looking almost entranced, &quot;If that's what daddy's little <br />
girl wants...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary whispered the details of the part of Trevor's curse that locked him in his form. Brian <br />
asked her daughter Transform or Dare, Mary answered without hesitation, and Brian told <br />
her sealing her fate, and Mary then asked her parents the same question and they <br />
obediently answered, and in a minute also, their fates too were sealed. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The police officer when came into the house was a busty woman, blond, and had long <br />
curly hair. She took one look at Serenity and said, &quot;Hey Old Man Scotts. So old age finally <br />
caught up with you again eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Irish, ugh, WAS irish!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same diff'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul came down from the roof grunting at his damaged ribs, looking decidedly tired after <br />
his fight with the gray female with the ribbon, but he had rested only a short time, he <br />
should have reseted longer but had proven stubborn. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO!&quot; The she cop said, &quot;This the nasty?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noh.&quot; Said the big orange ape.<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn't!&quot; Serenity moved fast before the cop could grab her weapon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze, don't scare me like that, this is Glendale, you don't know who you can trust...&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor walked into the living room moving like a drunken sailor. Mary emerged with her <br />
parents following behind and quickly scoped up Trevor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good Mr. and Mrs. Hardy...&quot; The blond she cop said in a perfectly calm and civilized voice <br />
to who she saw as simply the rightful owners of the house.<br />
<br />
Serenity looked at all of them. And sighed. Not wanting to bother to explain to the cop <br />
that the Hardys weren't supposed to be lion people. <br />
<br />
Of course Felicity dragged Ashley behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;OFFICER SAVE ME!&quot; Ashley tried. <br />
<br />
The she cop looked, &quot;This the nasty then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The lions said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're going now.&quot; Serenity said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want us to abandon our home?&quot; Felicity asked incredulous.<br />
<br />
&quot;I abandoned mine because Julie knew where it was... but somehow they found Julie after <br />
she left with her daughters, that's who hired me to try and do something about her <br />
vanishing husband whose apparently part of this pack too logically. Then Julie ended up <br />
changed as well. Now they know where I was? Right after getting here? I don't believe in <br />
random chance like that. We're going now. I already call Gill, the police chief to expect us <br />
at the police station with the officer he sent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So ya know da curse is real?&quot; Mary asked still holding Lance. <br />
<br />
The buxom blond pointed at herself, &quot;I used to be a effeminant man named Bob, joker <br />
didn't think to make me harmlessly give the curse back to'em, but he didn't count on that I <br />
still had my baton and police raining he tried to get down to business. And yeah, the joker <br />
used the whole 'always this way and no way back' clause. Jerkass. But the prick wanted me <br />
to appreciate everything that was gonna happen to me and left me that makes me me <br />
intact.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity asked, &quot;Do you still have your turn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry no, I used it on a serial child kidnapper who had off early a while back (early cause <br />
he wasn't in the ground yet), gave him a look that no would trust and sent him on his <br />
way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity put two and two together. &quot;And you let him KEEP THIS turn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I...didn't say I thought it out as well as I should have.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary however, had the monster who had changed at the back of her mind, her mind right <br />
now was on her family and pride. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's get going.&quot; The she cop said, &quot;I can call in the others maybe...&quot; <br />
<br />
Brain said, &quot;We can take Trevor, Mary and the wolf in our car. You can fit Paul in yours <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cop replied rather agitated, &quot;Now come on, she's a suspect and speaking of which.&quot; <br />
She looked at Ashley, &quot;You have the right to remain silent,-&quot; The she cop began and told <br />
the wolf her rights. <br />
<br />
After hearing her right Ashley laughed, &quot;Can you even try me in a human court? Ha ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a part of civilization like the Hardys, so save it. And now what's that nonsense <br />
about me not taking the suspect in my squad car?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;She's too big to fit, our car is build for people our size. And if she breaks lose, we're <br />
better equipped to handle her.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... fine... but if she escapes, you're facing jail time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She won't.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
The squad car drove with the Hardy's vehicle in front (if Ashley broke out it would likely be <br />
from the rear), Brian driving, Mary sitting in Felicity's lab and Trevor in Mary's lab. <br />
<br />
Ashley was mostly quite, though still throwing jabs about the lions being no match for the <br />
superior brains of the wolves and The Master. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's got to be something we can do.&quot; Felicity sighed looking over at their prisoner. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing you can do! My wolf self is complete! It's the only form I'll ever have! <br />
Game over!&quot; <br />
<br />
Felicity thought. 'What's the point of all of this? Is it wrong I'm a lion, or is it wrong if I <br />
thought 'I can just make more' if I lost Mary? Is it wrong these people are wolves... or is it <br />
wrong they're slaves?' <br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley.... Transform or Dare?&quot; Felicity said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;HA! If I chose Dare you'll make me betray my family and pack! F'you! I chose transform! <br />
I'd rather be a she wolf shaped bar of chocolate than stab my pack mates in the back <br />
because of the game that brought us together to begin with! I CHOSE TRANSFORM! Suck <br />
on that!&quot; <br />
<br />
Felicity face didn't change. &quot;... Transform, into a person who can appreciate everything <br />
you, and your Master, and all your pack mates: have done, are doing, and will do: with <br />
perfect objectivity.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ashley gasped. She shook her head and shook it again, she would have held her head i she <br />
wasn't chained up. Instead she simply had to endure the feeling of her brain nearly being <br />
split in two by the pain as she felt blood vessels pound and felt the cruel, vicious, <br />
undeniable, ruthless, overwhelming, uncompromising, brighter than the sun sharper than <br />
razors clarity of TRUTH!    What Master and Alpha Female had done to each other. What <br />
they had done to their parents. Marcine and Jack. Martha. Master's great grandfather. The <br />
kitchen and ground staff who were now the gargoyles and shadows. The betas. Her pack <br />
mates! The pups!  Ashley screamed. <br />
<br />
Her head leaned down as she patted heavily and bug-eyed. Her ears drooped flat against <br />
her skull. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I.... I remember... I remember all of it.&quot; What had Master, what had her pack, what SHE <br />
done-?! <br />
<br />
It also occurred to her now, objectively, if she hadn't been so hell bent on being the <br />
heroine outright defying her captor heroically as her pack mate mounted as dramatic <br />
rescue, she could have used her Transform or Dare on the lions.  But that didn't really <br />
matter anymore, what if's and could have's rarely did. What had she DONE, what she <br />
DONE?!  <br />
<br />
Master should have never created the pack out of unwilling members, and fifty three. Fifty <br />
three people not counting the six shadows, the six gargoyles, and Jack and Marcine, and <br />
the five statues. Fifty three and twelves made sixty five, sixty five and seven made seventy <br />
two. Seven two people, that was how many the game had  altered, all of them against their <br />
freedom of will... Well, Alexandra had said she would have willing been transformed <br />
anyway, her loyalty to the Smiths trumped everything even before the transformation <br />
Ashley thought logically.  Alexandra had actually been agitated with Master that he hadn't <br />
-trusted- her to accept the transformation willingly.  But seventy one others... seventy <br />
one.  Including her.  What choice had any of them been given? <br />
<br />
&quot;I remember it all.&quot; She repeated a third time. &quot;All of it. .... I... I apologize for taking part in <br />
invading your home and planning to assimilate your family and kidnapping your friends... <br />
my loyalty is to Master and my pack but... that's no excuse for breaking the law and trying <br />
to force our will on you... we could have -asked- Miss Serenity to leave us alone then and <br />
there, and it should have been suggested, and with our numbers now at the level for short <br />
term survival, -there's fifty-three of us total of the seventy-two transformed at the estate <br />
by the way- we could have brought to the table that we would seek out no new victims <br />
since we're immune to being revert anyway thanks to the choice of words of Alice, that's <br />
our semantics master and the one who can pass through any reflective surface along with <br />
her two  cousins/half-sisters.&quot; <br />
<br />
Of all the reactions the Transform would cause, none of the lions had expected this. <br />
<br />
Felicity continued, &quot;Ashley, what are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love Master Jensen, I love my packmates, but we've doomed ourselves by using unwilling <br />
people to transform into our pack... we'll be destroyed in one shape or another if we <br />
continue this way. We were wrong to break and enter into your home, and to try and <br />
kidnap Miss Serenity and Mr. Trevor just to have a chitchat.&quot; Ashley shivered, &quot;What I did <br />
was wrong and a crime... I was taught better than that.&quot;  The she cop had been right <br />
Ashley thought, they WERE part of civilization, and the pack couldn't survive if the Master <br />
thought they were somehow ABOVE it. <br />
<br />
The lions all looked at each other, again, they had expected the Transform to simply not <br />
work, or for Ashley maybe to go crazy, or for her brainwashing to shatter. Only now, she <br />
was the same as before, only now, as the Transform had specified, she could fully <br />
appreciate everything she, her pack and Jensen had done from a perfectly fair and <br />
impartial point of view. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are three of us who can pass through mirrors and take others with them, Alice, <br />
Samantha and Abbey, all little girls, anyone whose not a wolf they bring in becomes made <br />
out of living glass like them. Don't worry about being rough with them, they can't be so <br />
much as scratched, it's part of their transform.   There two other pups, Amy and Zelipe, <br />
white and red fur, and pink fur, anyone they touch and call a Big Bad Wolf turns into one.... <br />
Oh, and Master is the big bad wolf... from the story book, it was part of the original <br />
Transform that Alpha Female placed on him before she was Alpha Female.&quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity needed to know, &quot;... Who are they really? Jensen and Alpha Female? <br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer Smith and Kyle Perkins.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor heard the name, and fainted. <br />
<br />
Ashley managed to catch this out of the corner of her eye, &quot;Is he going to be okay?&quot; She <br />
asked, the fact that people who weren't part of her family and pack (which she still loved <br />
and would still die for) were PEOPLE and not just 'potential wolves' awakening in her brain <br />
again. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I think so...&quot; Mary said innocently, &quot;I think it's just time for his catnap.&quot;  <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger... your eye...&quot; Megan looked horrified. <br />
<br />
Where one eye had been was now only a bloody mess, Lawrence looked at her sadly with <br />
his surviving one. &quot;The cat that broke into the estate before did this... by the time we dealt <br />
with it, those lion things attacked us next.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn them.&quot; Megan snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, you'll get to pay them back for me soon, Master is call in nearly everyone to  <br />
come with him to take care of them and capture Serenity one way or the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan gasped. &quot;Master?! Is leaving the estate?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's left before to get his tooth made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that wasn't into danger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's what Master wants, and it's for the greater good of the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan merely nodded.  'Brother....' Megan thought dismayed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have to take so long Alice?&quot; Jensen said with her his army behind him.<br />
<br />
Alice handed him the wording of doom, &quot;Precision takes time father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Jensen said once again making the error of not trying to sense were <br />
Serenity was now, assuming she'd still be at the house, &quot;Let's go!&quot;</p>
