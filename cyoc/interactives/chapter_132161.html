<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Office pranks dude! We can do a number with that watch!&quot; Daniel said excitedly. She took Nolan by the wrist and dragged him about the office until they reached a cubical across from an office door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, use that watch to give us some cover, it can do that right?&quot; Daniel asked, whispering all the while. Nolan nodded his head, and tinkered with the watch, selecting himself and Daniel then setting an &#39;unaware&#39; status to them. He gave his friend a thumbs up and she sprang into action. <br />
<br />
Still sneaking she reached into the cubical. the woman within typing away on her computer payed her no mind as Daniel&#39;s flabby arm snatched the compressed air freshener from her desk. &quot;Hey Nolan, make a zip tie for me will ya?&quot; She ask as she placed herself against the office door cracking it open. <br />
<br />
Inside sat a professional looking man, black work suit and blue tie spinning in his chair talking on his phone. Nolan handed him the zip tie he&#39;d just fabricated from thin air. &quot;Ok, now make this freshener transformative. Anything you want, this&#39;ll be great. Noal knew just what to do, with a few taps of the watch he hit &#39;apply&#39; and the bottle shook in Daniel&#39;s hand. He quickly wen&#39;t back to the watch and changed the surrounding areas setting, making transformations an everyday possibility, no need to insight a riot with a little fun. <br />
<br />
Daniel fastened the zip tie around the trigger of the can and cracked the door further. &quot;Fire in the hole!&quot; She yelled as she pulled the zip tie tight locking the trigger in place and tossing the can inside as it fired its potent intoxicatingly fresh spay to no end. She closed the door shut and held it their. The windows into the office shook as the room filled with a white mist, a brief clambering of the man inside could be heard but soon ended as Nolan and Daniel retreated to watch the fall out. <br />
<br />
The door cracked open and the white mist trailed out into the hall like a morning dew. &quot;Your going to love this!&quot; Nolan said nudging his friend to watch closely. From behind the door emerged a giant of a man, his suit bursting at the seems around his arms and legs. His gut popping out of his shirt covered in mint green fur as were the popped seams of his clothes, green fur trying to escape. A thick fluffy tail poked out of his torn pants with two white stripes running down it and his face clearly resembled that of a skunk&#39;s. He stood there arms crossed, holding the spray bottle in one hand and looking quite unhappy at the woman working outside his door.<br />
<br />
The woman continued to type at her desk until her nose flared at the strong smell of mint. She looked beside her in surprise at her coworker. &quot;Tom! What happened to you?&quot; She asked, trying not to laugh. &quot;Very funny Brenda! Lets see how you like it!&quot; Yelled Tom as he did a 180 and lifted his tail. With a little &#39;poot&#39; a pink cloud shot right into Brenda&#39;s face causing it to sprout fur and morph into a skunk muzzle as well. Only her fur was a soft purple as it raced down her neck over her body. She too swelled as weight and fur poured over her, stretching her clothes to the point of bursting. Her breasts gaining three cup sizes and belly falling onto her lap as her thighs ballooned in size making her business dress skirt into a mini and wedging her into her computer chair while a luxuries fluffy lavender tail engulfed the cubical. <br />
<br />
Nolan and Daniel laughed historically at the sight they had just witnessed as the faint smell of lavender drifted across the office floor. &quot;Ok, what&#39;s next?&quot; Nolan asked, huffing for breath. Daniel motioned him to fallow as she got up. She led him to the office kitchen and opened the fridge pulling out a pudding cup with a sticky note, her name written on it. &quot;Every time I bring one of these to work, someone eats it. That ends today! Set it so whoever eats it get turned into something!&quot;<br />
&quot;Any preference?&quot;<br />
&quot;No just make it obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan did his work to the pudding cup and set it back in the fridge. &quot;Ok, so shat do we do while we wait then.&quot; Nolan asked closing the door. Daniel tapped her thick blubbery chin. &quot;Oh I got it, over here.&quot; The two went back to their cubical noticing on across the ally was currently emptied of its occupant. &quot;Jerry&#39;s a cool guy but he&#39;s a germ freak, look over there.&quot; Daniel pointed to his desk where in the corner sat three bottles of hand sanitizer, one still in use. &quot;Every time he comes back to his cubical he lathers up, give him something extra.&quot; She said with a wink. <br />
<br />
Nolan finished his adjustments just in time as Jerry returned to his desk with missing a best he pumped two squirted into his hands and spread it around. <br />
<br />
Jerry swiveled back to his keyboard and started typing when he noticed something strange, his fingers felt loose? He stopped and looked down at his hands, his skin turned yellow and became littered with green spots. His palms bubbles as small suction cups sprung from his skin and stretched up his fingers as they became limp and floppy. Each curled and contorted in imposable ways until it was clear his fingers were replaced with octopus tentacles. <br />
<br />
He sighed heavily and placed his hands back on the keyboard and started to type again, while also using his mouse. The new hands flopped over the keys withering and useless while also sucking onto the keys, the same happened to his mouse. Frustrated he stood up! &quot;Congratulations whoever you are, now I have to take a sick day thanks to this!&quot; Jerry shouted over the floor. Coworkers quietly snickered at him as he left, keyboard and mouse still stick to his hands. <br />
<br />
Nolan and Daniel shared a laugh at his expense two when their attention was caught by a odd sound, like a moose call but higher pitch. Nolan looked to his friend and pointed back to the kitchen. <br />
<br />
They peaked their head inside around the corner and immediately started to chuckle! Inside at a table sat a woman in a pink suit, holding the pudding cup in her hand and a spoon in the other. Daniel couldn&#39;t make out who it was, since her head had been replaced by a giraffe&#39;s from the neck up. The yellow and brown spotted neck arched upward then down over the table inside the small enclosure. Her thick purple tongue crammed into the pudding cup, licking it clean. Nolan looked back to his friend &quot;obvious enough for you?&quot; He said with a snicker. &quot;Oh man! That watch is too good! What should we do next?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan was about to suggest an idea when he heard a commotion from the front desk. &quot;Sir? Hey! Wait! You can&#39;t just barge in her without an appointment!&quot; Cried the desk clerk as three men wearing black suits and sunglasses entered the office floor, scanning the room. <br />
<br />
The suits had finally tracked him down!<br />
<br />
CLIFF HANGER!!!</p>
