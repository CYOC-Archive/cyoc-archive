<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While hunting down those meddlesome humans may have been prudent, he had used a lot of magic recently and needed a little reprieve from that. However, he wasn&#39;t completely ignoring the danger. With Ioke and Hybris out on patrol, he telepathically instructed one of them to go looking for the humans. <br />
<br />
After that, he summoned Harmonia and Themis to trot with him into a clearing behind some of the trees. This would be the start of the site of the first breeding. A momentous occasion that would serve as the origin of the herd. <br />
<br />
He glanced between the two queens. They were twins, so of course they looked practically identical. Both had pristine white coats that even dirt failed to stick to, with silky soft silver manes that cascaded down their necks. Their eyes were both a brilliant diamond blue, and of course they both had their royal golden horns.<br />
<br />
However, he was able to notice the subtle differences between them. Harmonia&#39;s mane was a bit curly and unkempt, while Themis&#39;s was a bit straighter. Harmonia was also a little bit more outgoing than Themis, her gait energetic. Whilst for Themis, her trot was cautious. Not that she was afraid of him. Far from it. But she was a little nervous.<br />
<br />
He asked Harmonia to come over to him first, to which she whinnied happily, bounding over like a filly. She took in his strong, musky scent with a nuzzle, and looked up to him with her tail swishing in excitement. He neighed in amusement, and asked her to turn around. The mare did so obediently, and lifted her tail before he even had to ask.<br />
<br />
Her feminine aromas wafted out of her posterior, helped by her tail fanning them into the stallion&#39;s nostrils. He inhaled the lovely smells and brought his muzzle to her clit, taking some laps at the quickly moistened folds. Harmonia shivered in delight, her own tongue sticking out as her king licked from her loins. She may have also been teasing her sister who watched with jealousy. Where was that nervousness now?<br />
<br />
Then, he stopped licking. Harmonia felt his strong, yet gentle forehooves get placed on her back. She knew what was coming next and lifted her flanks up into the air to assist her mate with what he was about to do. It only took seconds for him to thrust his colossal stallionhood into her awaiting foal hole, eliciting a loud neigh from her. It was her first time, and it hurt for a moment, but as he starting rhythmically pushing and pulling in and out, it was unbelievably satisfying. He pushed in, then she pushed back into him. In and out, in and out, the both of them getting wetter and sweatier. Until, finally, a large load of foal batter was shot down into her fertile womb. She neighed in delight, and he pulled himself out.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time, he sent Harmonia off to rest, and had Themis come up next. After watching her sister, a lot of her anxiety had dropped, replaced with eagerness. Good. Still, even with that, she had nowhere near the sexual confidence as Harmonia and waited for her mate&#39;s instructions on what to do.<br />
<br />
He patiently instructed her to help clean him up first, and turned around so she got a good look at his large equipment, coated in a mix of his and her sister&#39;s juices. She nodded and brought her muzzle over to his rear, starting to lick up the fluids. He stopped her, and told her to lower herself. Confused, but obedient to him, she did so, and watched as he turned around to be above her, his cock in front of her muzzle now. He had her open her mouth as wide as she could and thrust it in.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened in surprise. She would have never thought to use her other hole like this to please her mate. Does he...enjoy that? She started to suck on it as he thrusted his member into her mouth. Back and forth, back and forth, his warm stallion liquid gushing out and down her throat. It didn&#39;t taste bad, she thought. Maybe she was thinking about this too much. Her sister just kinda...let things happen, instead of overthinking it.<br />
<br />
So, she emptied her mind and just focused on the large organ in her mouth, sucking and swallowing until he commanded her to do something else. And, it wasn&#39;t long until he did. He was finished with foreplay and instructed her to stand back up and lift her tail. She got up as fast as she could to do so, nearly falling over from lightheadedness. Her sister, watching from nearby, whinnied. Was she making fun of her?<br />
<br />
Then, like a lightning bolt, she felt it. Her mate placed his hooves on her back and the large organ pierced her cunt. She neighed in surprise. It hurt, a lot! But, she remembered what she thought earlier....stop thinking. So, she did so, and the less she focused, the better it got. It stopped hurting, and it felt extremely nice! For those precious moments, her world became her and her mate&#39;s thrusts. However, all good things must come to an end, and he finished her off with a load of seed into her. She didn&#39;t even know it was over, still standing there with her eyes closed, until he gently told her she can go lay with her sister.<br />
<br />
Her sister was whinnying again. <br />
<br />
She nodded and trotted off to go lay by Harmonia, feeling very embarrassed.</p>
