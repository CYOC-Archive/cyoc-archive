<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was during third period as he listened to a thorough discussion of photosynthesis that Jared noticed the hairs sprouting on his arms. They were thicker than usual and not the usual light brown in coloration. Instead, the hairs were gray and extended right into his hands, sprouting even from his knuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he thought to himself and continued to watch the advance of gray fur as his right hand began to change. His thumb seemed to migrate farther from his other fingers as the nails changed to look like dull black claws. &quot;My fingers... they&#39;re turning into a dog&#39;s toes!&quot;<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, perhaps just to torment him, the change seemed to affect only his right hand. After staring in horrified fascination for most of the class, he quickly stuffed his dog&#39;s paw deep into the front pocket of his jeans when the bell rang to switch classes. Despite an awkward posture, Jared breathed in relief as he appeared to be capable of escaping detection so long as he kept his hand, or paw, in his pocket.<br />
<br />
During lunch in the cafeteria, he discovered another change as he took a bite from an apple. As he chewed, his tongue kept getting in the way. It felt odd and swollen, completely unable to fit into his mouth. He opened his mouth in surprise as an extremely long pink tongue and chunk of apple spilled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wut the fawk?&quot; Jared exclaimed. After a moment of panic, he got his tongue back into his mouth and kept his jaws firmly closed. &quot;Just two more classes, and I can get home,&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
The only awkward moment came when Ms. Bellapont tried to encourage him to join class discussion. Fortunately, she wasn&#39;t too determined and accepted Jared&#39;s surly shrug. &quot;Do go back and make sure you&#39;ve read the material, Jared,&quot; she told him.<br />
<br />
He gave a nod and rejoiced when she turned her attention to another student. Forty minutes later, the bell rang, sounding like the sweetest sound in the world to the anxious teenager. He only wanted to get home. He had almost made it to the door when Ms. Bellapont called him back.<br />
<br />
With the other students racing out the doors, Jared had to endure a mild lecture. <br />
<br />
&quot;You really must try harder, Jared,&quot; the teacher told him. &quot;I&#39;d hate for bad grades to affect your status to play baseball.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t risk speaking, so he nodded vigorously. He smiled, to show his sincerity, but had forgotten the way dogs smile. His tongue fell out!<br />
<br />
He covered up quickly, retracting the oversized organ and hoping she hadn&#39;t noticed anything amiss. She looked somewhat embarrassed. &quot;Well, that will be all, Mr. Webster,&quot; she said hastily.<br />
<br />
He nodded and dashed toward the door. The corridors had already emptied of students in their haste to get home. Jared made his way to the student parking lot and had almost reached his car when he felt a hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re late,&quot; Kirk said.<br />
<br />
Jared almost jumped from his skin. He turned to face a grinning Kirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll take my car,&quot; Kirk said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today,&quot; he managed to say rather plainly. &quot;Pwease, Kork.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get in the car,&quot; Kirk order and opened the passenger door. Something about the larger youth&#39;s tone made Jared feel compelled to obey. He slid into the seat and Kirk slammed the door closed, making him feel trapped. If Kirk had noticed anything off with his slurred words, he hadn&#39;t let on.<br />
<br />
Kirk climbed behind the wheel and put the keys in the ignition. Before he started the car, he reached across and groped Jared, feeling for a tell-tale bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not happy to see me yet,&quot; he remarked. &quot;You will be, bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of driving toward town, Kirk turned on the road to the lake. Fifteen minutes later he pulled into a driveway leading to a lakeside cabin. The other youth&#39;s cologne in the enclosed vehicle had been overwhelming as it mingled with another more musky scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;My folks keep this place for when my dad wants a long weekend for fishing,&quot; Kirk explained.<br />
<br />
Jared squirmed in the seat, feeling his cock very active as it stretched and ventured out of its furry sheath. He stood awkwardly as they got out of the car, Kirk leading the way to the cabin&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
They had barely gotten inside the house when Kirk slammed the door and pushed Jared against a wall, pinning him there, securing him in place with a muscular arm on either side of him. Kirk looked pleased with himself as he leaned closer and pressed his mouth to Jared&#39;s.<br />
<br />
With a shock, Jared felt his lips open as Kirk pushed his tongue into his mouth. Jared responded, with his own dog&#39;s tongue pushing back, wrestling against the football jock&#39;s tongue as the open-mouthed kiss continued for a long time. He felt Kirk&#39;s hands running along his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, you&#39;re a good kisser, bitch,&quot; Kirk said. He pushed down on Jared&#39;s shoulders to make the slimmer baseball player kneel. He hurriedly unfastened his pants and pushed them and his underwear down. &quot;Kiss that now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk&#39;s forceful tones obliterated Jared&#39;s feeble resistance as he again felt compelled to obey. He took his left hand and cupped the jock&#39;s heavy balls. The same tongue that had so impressed Kirk during their kiss now seemed to deliver intense pleasure to the burly football player as Jared lapped at the hard cock.<br />
<br />
As he sucked hard, Jared despaired when he saw his left hand had begun to change to match the right. A gray fur overtook his hand as the fingers rearranged and transformed into toes.<br />
<br />
He felt Kirk&#39;s fingers prowl on the side of his face, stroking his ears. Jared almost blanked out from the spasms of sensation as he felt the fingers dig behind his furry, floppy ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Furry!&quot; Jared thought. &quot;Floppy!&quot;<br />
<br />
At almost the same instant, Kirk realized something was not quite right.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Kirk said with surprised force.<br />
<br />
Jared felt pains in his stomach and doubled over, putting his front paws on the floor as more of his body raced to change to match them.<br />
<br />
He felt his face push out, trying to form a dog&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
Kirk, his pants still down around his ankles, stepped back. &quot;Dude! What the fuck is happening to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Oh no!&quot; Jared didn&#39;t know if he was speaking or thinking the words. &quot;Please, stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk snapped out of his shock long enough to retrieve his phone and start filming.<br />
<br />
Was Kirk filming him? &quot;Kirk! Help....rrr...ruff, ruff.&quot;<br />
<br />
His face changed as his nose turned dark and leathery at the end of an extended muzzle. His pleas for Kirk&#39;s help changed into a dog&#39;s barking.<br />
<br />
Kirk finished recording the unbelievable transformation with his phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so wild!&quot; Kirk exclaimed and looked down at an Old English Sheepdog still wearing most of Jared Webster&#39;s clothing.</p>
