<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the family sat and pondered what to do next, Steve stood up from his seat with conviction and a determined look in his eyes. Alan and Megan both tried not to laugh upon seeing their father trying to act so seriously while wearing a pair of overalls and a kiddie t-shirt. He looked down at the book and cleared his throat. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I should change us back!&quot; He announced, trying his best not to say any words with &#39;r&#39;s in them as to avoid further humiliation. &quot;I got us into this mess, so I should fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s kind of you Dad, but I don&#39;t even know if we should try to fix this right away.&quot; Alan rebutted. &quot;I mean, this thing alters the very fabric of reality! We can&#39;t just go around all willy nilly, changing stuff when we don&#39;t even know how to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve tried not too nap but was clearly losing his temper fast. He was sick and tired of all this magical nonsense, and was about to fix this once and for all.<br />
&quot;We alweady messed with it!&quot; He yelled, on the verge of childish tears. &quot;And I&#39;m gonna undo it all!&quot; He yelled, grabbing the book from the table.<br />
<br />
Janet could only watch in horror as her husband ran off with the book. She couldn&#39;t walk or run or talk so she sat there and cried. Alan and Megan were surprised but started to chase after him a moment later. Steve quickly realized that the magic was making him run slower than he should&#39;ve been running, so he knew he had to act quickly. He flipped open the book as he stopped in the door frame. Alan, Megan, and Janet watched in fear as the bright light filled the room once again.<br />
<br />
Steve opened his eyes slowly, as the light had shined so brightly that he couldn&#39;t see for a few moments. As his vision returned, he started to make out where he was. He was lying on the floor, about where he had been a second before. He had no memory of falling, but figured that maybe the book must&#39;ve reset something or other. He tried to hop up but found himself with his hands firmly back on the ground.<br />
<br />
He was very confused, so he tried once more but couldn&#39;t stand up. That&#39;s when he saw his hand. It was covered in hair. He was fairly hairy before, but now it looked like he hadn&#39;t let it stop growing for years straight. He felt his hair on his head brush past his neck, and as he looked around his body, he found himself still human, but covered in his unkept hair. He also found that he was naked.<br />
<br />
Due to the cold, his penis started to grow erect, so out of embarrassment he scurried into the next room. He didn&#39;t even know what had happened to his family. Obviously they hadn&#39;t turned back to normal like he wasn&#39;t, but he couldn&#39;t go out there in his present state. He started scratching at his neck subconsciously, but soon found, to his horror, that he was doing so with his leg. <br />
<br />
He stumbled again, sliding around the floor on all fours, as he made his way to one of the bathrooms. He propped himself up on the sink and stared in horror at what the world saw him as. What stared back at him was poodle. On its collar, the name &quot;Stephi&quot; could barely be read. Steve screwed up, big time. The world now saw him as a female poodle. He wanted to cry, but only dog like whimpers came out. He tried to call out for his family, but only fake human barks came out.<br />
<br />
He awkwardly stumbled back into the kitchen, and found what he had done. Megan stood in the kitchen, leaning on a chair, still very much her 12 year old girl self, but now with even crazier clothes. Her hair was cut short to a boyish buzz, and she was standing there in a suit. Alan was sitting in a play pen, his hair curly below his ears, a pink dress around his body, and an adult diaper around his waist. Mrs. Baker, for some reason, was in the kitchen stirring something on the stone, completely oblivious to the life changing/reality altering shenanigans happening around her. <br />
<br />
And finally there was Janet. She was naked, standing up fully erect. Her boobs were standing at attention and she was cleanly shaven. Her body looked cold and unmoving, almost like a mannequin. Her eyes were darting around desperately, but she couldn&#39;t move anything else. Her hair, strangest of all, was stayed into a disk like design and was gelled up above her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on honey, you&#39;ve had a crazy busy day at work.&quot; Kylie chuckled, kissing a very surprised Megan on the lips. &quot;Go take off your work clothes while dinner is cooking, I&#39;ll find something on tv for us to watch until it&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked to Alan sitting in the play pen, and lifted him up with ease, before sitting down on the recliner with Alan sitting on her lap. She turned him around and began making googoo eyes at him, saying stuff like &quot;Who&#39;s my cutie girl Alana?&quot; and other such nonsense until she did something that shocked them all.<br />
&quot;Phew, it&#39;s getting dark in here.&quot; She announced, before turning to Janet.<br />
<br />
She then proceeded to pinch, and then turn one of Janet&#39;s nipples. Instead of screaming, Janet simply and robotically said &quot;click&quot; as she continued to stand erect. No light actually came out of her, but Kylie relaxed anyway.<br />
&quot;Ah, much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s heart sank lower than it had ever been. In his recklessness, he had trapped his wife into the life of a lamp. Steve could only watch in horror as Kylie unfastened her bra, and plunged Alan&#39;s face into it. On instinct, Alan was forced to suckle away while Kylie sung. She looked up noticing Steve had been staring.<br />
&quot;Ugh, actually honey, before you get changed, can you let the dog out?&quot; She asked Megan, still standing in the kitchen dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
Megan seemed to half snap out of it. She looked down to see Steve in his hairy, collared state above the book still on the ground. Her eyes squinted and she smirked.<br />
&quot;Sure thing, honey.&quot; She said coldly.<br />
<br />
Steve tried to talk to her but only barks came out. Megan grabbed Steve by the collar, and despite being hundreds of pounds heavier than her, Megan was able to move Steve with ease. She practically chucked Steve out into the backyard.<br />
&quot;Nice going &#39;Stephi.&#39; I mean, really great job.&quot; She sarcastically nagged at Steve. &quot;Because you couldn&#39;t stand talking a little funny for a few more hours, I&#39;m in the life of an older dude version of myself, Alan&#39;s a baby girl, you&#39;re a freaking poodle, and Mom is A LAMP. I hope being out here pissing in the bushes like the bitch you&#39;re living as right now will give you time to think about what you did.&quot; She yelled before closing the door.<br />
<br />
Steve wanted to object, but even if he could, he agreed with Megan. He acted selfishly, and now the family was in an even crazier situation. He sadly curled up into the classic dog position in the grass, and decided to sadly wait it out, hoping that Megan could get this fixed.</p>
