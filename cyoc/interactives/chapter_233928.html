<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily slept peacefully as the sun rose higher into the air. opening her eyes she found herself not on her bed but on the floor of her dining room. picking herself up she gasped at the sight before her. One of her chairs was broken and the others were tipped over in varying places. even the table was flipped with a sticky goo coating it.  <br />
<br />
more of this musky goo-coated various surfaces as she looked around. grasping her head she walked into the kitchen. it was even worse than the dining room. Several of the cabinet doors were ripped off their hinges. the floors and walls were covered in every type of food she had.  <br />
<br />
water pooled from the open freezer. in the mess, a set of footprints led to the open door and disappeared off the patio. Apart from some food and a large crack on the patio&#39;s glass door, it looked the least messy. a second set of footprints led to the room Emily had just left. when she felt a breeze from the open door she realized she was naked and ran to the closet. &#39;what happened last night&#39; she thought. she soon went to her bathroom and saw what happened the night prior. the broken bathroom door was all she needed for her memories to come back to her about Ace. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ace felt a lust like he had never known as a female. he grabbed his dick and jacked off with it. several thick ropes of cum from his foot-long dick before his chair broke from his actions. this caused the table to be flipped by his strong legs and the chairs the fall. he didn&#39;t stop there as he rubbed his cock on the neighboring chair and shot several more loads.  <br />
<br />
he repeated this amazing action until he was spent. after this the next feeling came to him, hunting. Luckily there was plenty of food in the kitchen. for a while, he tore the cabinets open and opened the fridge to satiate his immense hunger. once he was done and his instincts died down he looked at his food-covered hands and the mess he had made. chuckling he licked himself clean.  <br />
<br />
even as a werewolf himself, he was surprised with how flexible he was. looking out into the night sky he saw his beautiful moon and wanted to have fun beneath it. he grabbed the door and opened it. this action caused the lock to break and a large crack in the glass. &quot;oops&quot; Ace said. shrugging it off for his daytime self to worry about he walked into the cool summer air. he grabbed the patio railing with one hand and jumped over it. sprinting he jumped over his fence with ease. tonight was his first night and he was gonna make the most of it. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ben was taking out the trash when he heard a noise. it sounded like a thud. Panicking Ben grabbed a broken bottle and held it up. &quot;Who&#39;s there!?&quot; he yelled. no answer was heard, not even a sound. after a nervous chuckle, Ben took a step back and turned.  <br />
<br />
&quot;keep you cool Ben. it was probably just...&quot; he stopped and looked up. a seven-foot figure with glowing eyes growled at him. Ben slashed at the figure when its furry hand came into the light of the moon. it didn&#39;t even scratch the beast as it walked out of the shadow it was in. The werewolf grabbed the bottle and crushed it into tiny shards with an annoyed look.  <br />
<br />
Ben tried to run down the sidewalk but was tackled by the male. in his desperation, he punched and kicked at the beast. one kick hit the beast&#39;s large sack causing confusion and pain on the werewolf&#39;s face. Ben found himself flipped onto his stomach and his clothes ripped. to stop his struggling for this part the werewolf sunk his fangs into the man&#39;s neck as his cock plunged into the man&#39;s ass.  <br />
<br />
with tears of pain, Ben could only hope that after the beast was done he could escape. After the beast released his load he chuckled. &quot;that&#39;s for the assault&quot; the werewolf said as he got off of Ben. &quot;argh, you can talk&quot; Ben said struggling to get up. he settled with sitting on the driveway.  <br />
<br />
&quot;well I wanted to ask you to join my pack as we had been neighbors but then you tried to hurt me&quot; the werewolf pretended to be upset. &quot;forgive me if I&#39;m scared of a seven-foot figure in the dead of night,&quot; he said. his wound was healing rapidly as his tailbone grew. fur covered him as they spoke. &quot;wait you said... neighbor?&quot; Ben asked dark grey fur covered the wound as well as his new tail. with a smile, the werewolf helped Ben up.  <br />
<br />
&quot;yep I figured you had a crush on my human form or at the very least were single,&quot; the wolf said. a light bulb went off in Ben&#39;s brain as his shirt was stretched by two bumps. &quot;Emily?&quot; he asked with a higher voice. it was still deep but was also feminine. &quot;yes and no&quot; &#39;Emily&#39; said as he could smell the arousal Ben was getting. the lack of bulge on his tearing jeans and the wet spot on the crotch made Ace&#39;s cock hard as well.  <br />
<br />
&quot;the name&#39;s Ace. I&#39;ll be an alpha one day. will you be my mate&quot; Ace said. Ben&#39;s eyes glowed as he felt the moon embrace her. After her jeans broke off and revealed her strong ass she presented herself then and there. &quot;call me Belle. I am yours my love&quot; Belle then felt Ace&#39;s cock go into her and then to fucked. this accelerated the changes for Belle.  <br />
<br />
her loose lumberjack shirt became tight as the buttons flew off. this revealed two large orbs the size of a human head each. light grey fur covered the front of her neck down to her inner thighs and under her tails. each digit on her limbs gained a claw as well as pads on her palms and soles. her hair grayed and became long and flowing down her neck.  <br />
<br />
Finally, her ears became pointed and a dark grey muzzle grew on her face. the two howled into the night. after they were done they found one drawback to being werewolves. &quot;I think I&#39;m stuck,&quot; Ace said. &quot;well how about a round two at your place,&quot; Belle said. a kiss from her caused his knot to get even tighter. thankfully while she had grown Ace was still strong enough to carry her.  <br />
<br />
After unlatching the gate he and his mate went to his dining room and made out some more until he could let go of her. afterward, Belle ate some food and went to the guest room while Ace felt pent up watching his mate&#39;s gorgeous breasts. he passed out near morning after cuming some more. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Emily suddenly went wide-eyed as she realized she wasn&#39;t alone. despite a human appearance she still had a better sense of smell than before. She quickly got dressed as the guest room door opened. She had just put her glasses on her face when she heard Ben. &quot;please tell me I was dreaming&quot; he said wearing a button-less lumberjack shirt and a blanket as a kilt.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Depending on what you dreamed&quot; Emily was embarrassed by what her nighttime self had done. it was one thing to make a mess, it was another to have brought someone else into this without consent. in the living room, the two sat down on the couch. it was untouched by their new night-time selves. Emily then explained what she could remember as she held the card in her hands.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry that he... that I did that. I dreamed about something like this happening but not... him&quot; She let out a few tears as she felt the same way Ace did about Ben. She had just never been able to act on it. deluding herself that it could never work. a hand on her shoulder stopped the waterworks. &quot;hey it&#39;s okay. they&#39;re just more to the point than us. that doesn&#39;t mean that I feel any less, how about you?&quot; Ben smiled. the two hugged for a while before Emily and Ben went their separate ways. it was unclear if they would be friends or more. they at the very least agreed to be neighbors. Emily sighed as she shut the sliding door. this mess was gonna take a while. <br />
<br />

<br />
after selling a teenager a game the young man went to the back of the store. the magic shop had shifted to an abandoned building in another part of the country. the old lady sighed at her latest form. like the magic shop, each form is different for her. The shapeshifter was charged with bringing magic to many different dimensions that had never had it or that had lost it long ago. Once she was done she would get a new form based anywhere between the ages of twenty to ninety.  <br />
<br />
Sadly the latter seemed more likely for her. being gender-less her appearance was a fifty-fifty chance of being a man or woman. the pool rippled as she passed it. this meant a new magic had appeared in this world. waving her hand over it showed Ace and Belle. &quot;the names Ace. I&#39;ll be an alpha one day. will you be my mate&quot; Ace said.  <br />
<br />
the old lady laughed as this made her job easier. once enough magic was in this world it was off to the next one. for now, she had to wait through the night for someone to purchase her wares.</p>
