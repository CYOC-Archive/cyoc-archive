<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, I was watching Jake completely botch acting seductive through the mirror when Morgana came in. <br />
She tossed me onto the bed, motioned for me to stay silent, and peeked out the window. She apparently saw <br />
something interesting, because she backed away for a second and started jumping for joy. Then things got <br />
strange. Well, stranger, as I suppose having a perverted witch prancing about in my room while I have to stay <br />
silent is already fairly strange. Anyway, Morgana flicked her wrist and instantly changed. This time, she <br />
looked like me. She was an exact copy of me, and all she had to do was flick her wrist? It was a horrifying <br />
thought, and I tried to distract myself from it by watching what Morgana did with my form. She leaned between <br />
the bars of my window and started waving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess, there you are! Are you alright?&quot; A voice shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes fair prince! Are you here to rescue me?&quot; Morgana yelled back. Once again, she had gotten the voice <br />
disturbingly right.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are! Is the accursed witch in the castle?&quot; The prince replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fair prince, she is in distant lands. I am all alone in this castle.&quot; Morgana said while making <br />
hilariously over-dramatic hand motions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. Stay where you are, we'll be right there!&quot; The prince yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wait! The door is trapped! I know a better way!&quot; Morgana said, a horribly evil grin appearing on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, how should we enter?&quot; The prince asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a hedge maze nearby. It is enchanted so that anyone who solves it is transported inside.&quot; Morgana <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're on our way. Fear not princess!&quot; The prince said.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Morgana pulled her head back in and started laughing. She dropped the spell that made her <br />
look like me, and sat next to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh goodness, can you believe him? Doesn't know if I'm here, starts yelling at me, didn't even try to climb <br />
the wall. On top of that, why would you know about the hedge maze at all?&quot; Morgana said, clutching her sides <br />
in laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;So there is a maze? Why do you have a maze?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was left over from the last wizard who lived here. It's pretty small, but it's magic.&quot; Morgana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You actually told them how to get in? And here I was thinking I had been captured by a competent witch.&quot; I <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you still were. It doesn't actually get them in the castle, in fact they'll never leave the maze. The <br />
maze changes so that no one can solve it. On top of that, I enchanted it personally so that anyone who's in <br />
there for a long enough time... well, you'll see.&quot; Morgana said. Then she grabbed me by the arm and pulled me <br />
downstairs. We ran outside just in time to see the entrance to the maze seal itself. Morgana summoned a mirror <br />
that gave an aerial view of the maze. I could see my would-be rescuers now, and I recognized them. One was <br />
Prince Timothy. He was rich, handsome, kind, and noble. The only thing wrong was that A, he spent all of his <br />
time trying to save the elves' forest, and B, he only had eyes for those elves. Speaking of which, Prince <br />
Timothy was accompanied by three elven rangers who were wearing so little, it would make even Morgana blush. <br />
It appeared they were wearing nothing but leggings, corsets, and quivers. By now, the party had split up. Two <br />
of the rangers were in the left side of the maze, actually making good progress if not for the ever-shifting <br />
walls, and Timothy had led the remaining ranger into no less than twelve dead-ends. At least the pair of elves <br />
were in constant motion, never hitting a stop. Timothy seemed to be actively looking for ends. It wasn't long <br />
before his partner ran off without him and started trying to track the other two. They however, finally <br />
stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I didn't expect the rumors to be true.&quot; Morgana said with the biggest grin on her face I had ever seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What rumors? I don't understand.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sara honey, you see how those two elves are both leaning against the wall together?&quot; Morgana said as she <br />
pointed at the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes but... no, no that can't be. Are they? I mean they appear to be but...&quot; I said, too shocked to <br />
finish a sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are. You see, official elven rangers are all, how can I put this delicately? Fruity. It supposedly makes <br />
them less susceptible to being swayed from their mission, but these two appear to be swaying quite a bit.&quot; <br />
Morgana said. As we watched, the elves began undressing each other as they... embraced. After a bit, Morgana <br />
poofed up a bed and began to... let's just say that I couldn't look at anyone without seeing something I would <br />
have preferred to avoid seeing. Then I realized that there was someone I could watch. Timothy was still in the <br />
maze, and the other elf girl was searching as well. They were now on opposite sides of a wall, which had been <br />
somewhere completely different moments ago, and the elf seemed to notice. She peered through the leaves for a <br />
bit before reaching into the hedge. She immediately withdrew her arm and began cradling it. I thought of <br />
asking Morgana what was going on, but she was too preoccupied to look at this particular elf. Instead, I <br />
simply focused a bit. The mirror's magic seemed to be more powerful than I knew, as the image became more <br />
clear. I could see exactly what was happening, but it still showed the whole maze. The elf girl's arm had <br />
turned brown, and the brown color had spread. As it did, her skin seemed to get rougher. Before long, I <br />
realized what was happening. She was turning into wood. In a matter of moments, the poor girl was completely <br />
petrified. On the other side of the maze, the &quot;fruity&quot; pair had finished their &quot;embracing&quot; and had started to <br />
transform as well. They however, were still fondling each other as they transformed. Morgana sat up in her <br />
bed, apparently also done. She seemed very pleased, but also somewhat dazed. She shook it off and the image in <br />
the mirror changed. Instead of showing the whole maze, it only showed Timothy. He was still running through <br />
the maze. Now, he seemed very angry. After a few more dead-ends, he unsheathed his sword and started hacking <br />
at the maze. This seemed to make the maze very angry, as it pulled the sword in. Timothy, apparently dumber <br />
than I thought, started trying to dig into the hedge and pull it out. Within moments, a vaguely prince shaped <br />
tree stood in the middle of the maze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that went better than I expected.&quot; Morgana said as she stood up. &quot;Come along Sara, we have to go see <br />
what has become of our uninvited guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Go into the maze? We'll be trapped!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sara, honey, you know I can teleport right? I do it all the time.&quot; Morgana said. With that, the maze entrance <br />
reappeared and we went in.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of walking, we found the elf pair. They still mostly retained their shape, making it easy <br />
to tell where one elf stopped and the other started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite a pair huh? I think I'll keep these two.&quot; Morgana said as she cast a spell on the trees. First, they <br />
changed from rough, bark-y trees into wooden statues. Then, Morgana transported them away. Fortunately for us, <br />
a wall opened up right next to us, revealing the third elf.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one is less interesting. However, I still need firewood, so&quot; Morgana began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! You can't just burn her! Please, make her a statue too, she doesn't deserve this.&quot; I pleaded. Morgana <br />
looked shocked. She stayed silent for a while, clearly thinking it over. I was sure she would burn the poor <br />
thing on the spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what Sara, you've been very good lately. You've brought in a fair number of princes, you haven't <br />
tried to run away, you even help me by staying hidden when I need you to. If you really care about this girl, <br />
I'll let you keep her. In fact, I think I can do better.&quot; Morgana said. Then she turned around and started <br />
casting on the elf girl. First, she repeated the spell that reverted the tree's appearance. Then she knelt <br />
next to the statue and put her hand on it. She stayed like that for a long time, both of us completely silent. <br />
Then something remarkable broke the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what is this?&quot; Came a voice. I didn't know where it came from, but it sounded very feminine.<br />
<br />
&quot;This, young lady, is a statue. It appears that you were caught in the crossfire in my little war on princes. <br />
However, Sara here has asked me to undo some of the damage that occurred.&quot; Morgana said, gesturing toward me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you mean you&quot; I said, but this time it was Morgana's turn to cut me off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I brought back her soul. She's still a statue, but she's alive... technically.&quot; Morgana said.<br />
<br />
Then I did something I never thought I would do. I ran over to the horrible, perverted, evil, villainous, <br />
slutty witch who had kidnapped me, and I hugged her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thank you Sara, but I think our friend would prefer if you explained what's going on. Why don't you two <br />
go back to the castle while I look for the moron prince.&quot; Morgana suggested. I didn't have time to respond, as <br />
she immediately teleported me back into my room, which now had a wooden statue in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; The elf asked. I wasn't sure how to answer her.</p>
