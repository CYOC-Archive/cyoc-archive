<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No big deal.<br />
<br />
The four hopped back in the truck and started to drive away slowly and then they saw Brittany running after <br />
them.<br />
<br />
So what's the deal with the car?<br />
<br />
Well you got a broken crank shaft. The carb has enough muck in it to choke an elephant. There is a crack in <br />
generator. I hope you got time cause it is going to take awhile. Chet said hanging out the window. Take care.<br />
<br />
We will go I guess we got no choice.<br />
<br />
The bunch climbed in the back and the boys started to pick out their favorite.<br />
<br />
I wants me that purdy one puttin on that gunk on her face. Said Bubba. <br />
<br />
Oh hell Bubba you know you don't play fair.<br />
<br />
Billy and Troy laughed at Chet.<br />
<br />
When they got back to the house they saw a barn that looked like it was used to work on machinery so the girls <br />
didn't feel too surprised.<br />
<br />
So where we gonna stay Brittany asked.<br />
<br />
Bubba let out a creepy giggle.<br />
<br />
But Chet said with a reassuring smile. Right over here. Sorry you are going to have to share beds we don't <br />
have too many visitors so this is all we got.<br />
<br />
Brittany realizing that they probably had no choice looked at it. The sheets looked like they were freshly <br />
laundered if not thread bare.<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
So hows about sumpin to eat Troy stammered.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit hungry Jade said. Me too came from Ashley. They all agreed they could use something to eat.<br />
<br />
Bubba was int he kitchen for awhile but when he called the bunch to the kitchen table and they sat Brittany <br />
noticed quite a mismatched grouping of place settings.<br />
<br />
She did look at the casserole set at the table. Casserole yea I guess that was what it could have been called <br />
it was a roasting pan that most people would use for their thanksgiving turkey but Bubba just cooked in it.<br />
<br />
Smells yummy Brittany said. Not fibbing too much. It did have a nice country sort of smell.<br />
<br />
Bubba dished up the plates and as the girls protested he just smiled and plopped a heaping helping on their <br />
plates and said jus eat what yas want.<br />
<br />
Bubba heaped his up the highest and began to dig in.<br />
<br />
As they all dug in the girls began to feel a bit queezy. Well not really queezy but overwhelmed by the <br />
ingredients. As they ate they no longer saw their hosts as rednecks but as hansom buff muscle boys. This was <br />
too much for the girls and before they knew it they had each picked out a guy to nuzzle up next to.<br />
<br />
And Jade for some reason hooked up with Bubba who now looked like the very image of Michelangelo's David.<br />
<br />
Chet got Brittany, Sarah hooked up with Troy and Ashley hooked up with Billy.<br />
<br />
Jade thought it odd that the bed sank quite a bit when Bubba sat down next to her but then she was seeing <br />
David and in moments they were engaged in the most erotic encounter of her life.<br />
<br />
Jade was sweating from the exertion but she got up and had to use the bathroom and she ran into Brittany. She <br />
told Brittany of the excitement she was enjoying in Bubba's room and Brittany suggested they trade.<br />
<br />
One after another each girl traded with the others coming back to the bathroom to compare notes. They each had <br />
their favorites but all agreed that Bubba was the sex god. Bringing them to near exhaustion.<br />
<br />
When they woke the next morning their view of the world returned and Jade almost hit the roof when she saw <br />
herself nuzzling up to Bubba. Hows bout breakfast in bed. Bubba suggested.<br />
<br />
Jade just grabbed her things and headed out the door. The girls headed out the door and huddled in the <br />
bathroom. Within hours that wonderful aroma floated through the house. Bubba rang the dinner bell and the <br />
girls came from the bathroom like a pack of Pavlov's dogs.<br />
<br />
Chowing down they once again saw their greek gods and hooked up again with their choices.<br />
<br />
It was some weeks later, maybe 6 months or so when the boys told their story. They had been heading to Miami <br />
to for spring break when their car broke down in almost the identical space. The images the girls saw were <br />
what they were when they headed down but they had been forever changed into the image they see without the <br />
meals. It was all Bubba's doing. He had never been part of the group and he had ensnared the boys and now the <br />
girls. The boys had all tasted of Bubba's pleasures and they knew the girls would enjoy him too. <br />
<br />
As the months went by they all showed signs of the meals. It wasn't really that they were getting fat but that <br />
they were pregnant with Bubba's children. And they wouldn't be the first. Almost a year after their car broke <br />
down the group went into town and had a family picture taken. Each with a baby clasped to one breast and <br />
obviously pregnant with another. There in the middle was Bubba with Jade upon his knee and her kid sucking on <br />
her ample breast. The others stood around him hugging their girl and their child of Bubba. <br />
<br />
None of the boys had a viable seed but they were able to perform in every other way but getting the girls <br />
pregnant. That picture had show quite a change in the girls as well. Not only were their boobs massive, and <br />
their belly filled with Bubba's seed but they were becoming more redneck themselves. They had girl mullets <br />
becoming softer and becoming a blond tinge. They were probably looked on as passing at this point but that <br />
wouldn't last they would soon be seen as white redneck girls and popping out kid after kid year after year.<br />
<br />
And although they saw Bubba as David his was the only image that was true without the meals.</p>
