<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reverend David White looked at the people attending the church picnic this sunny morning and smiled.  It warmed his heart that so many of his parishioners had decided to attend.  Of course, being in the morning meant that not everyone could make it, as they had school or jobs.  But not everyone was working.  A lot of his church members were retired, after all.  His dutiful, but timid wife Carol walked over, smiling.  &quot;I think we&#39;ve had a good turn out.  It&#39;s just too bad the park department wouldn&#39;t let us do this later in the afternoon,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we should feel grateful that we were able to get THIS,&quot; he said, looking at the many older couples eating breakfast, fruit, and pastries at the park&#39;s picnic tables.  Some younger couples were there too, with their young children and babies.  It was so nice to see so many young people as part of his church.  And normal ones too.  None of these oddball types.  You know, like homosexuals and transsexuals.  Only people that were pure in the eyes of God.  It was only a few weeks ago when he encountered a woman who he realized wasn&#39;t actually a woman, but rather a transgender one.  It disgusted him how this person, who was actually a man, was dressed up looking like a woman, wearing a dress, make-up, jewelry, etc.  It just wasn&#39;t right.  He berated the person for &quot;her&quot; choices, telling the person that God didn&#39;t make a mistake, that &quot;she&quot; was meant to be a man, not a woman, and that &quot;she&quot; was just confused and messed up in the head.  Well, the apparent woman didn&#39;t take that very well and ...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a FLASH and everything changed.<br />
<br />
Reverend Carol White blinked.  What was she thinking about again?  Oh yeah.  It was that transgender man she met a few weeks ago.  Thinking back, she still felt weirded out by &quot;him&quot;, having long hair, wearing a dress, make-up, jewelry.  It just wasn&#39;t right.  Dresses and make-up were for men, not women.  She looked over at her sweet, but somewhat timid, husband David.  He had wandered off to talk to some of the house-husbands nearby.  Today, he was dressed in a conservative, but pretty, dress.  Yes, dresses were definitely made for men to wear.  Anyway, she recalled how the transman reacted badly to Carol telling &quot;him&quot; that &quot;he&quot; wasn&#39;t pure in the eyes of Goddess, that he was sinning and wouldn&#39;t be able to redeem &quot;himself&quot; unless he rejected his perverse way of thinking.  At least she tried to get the confused person on the right path.  It was up to Goddess herself to do the rest, she supposed.<br />
<br />
She looked at the church-folk milling about the park picnic tables, putting that bad situation out of her mind, choosing to focus on the pure things in life instead.  Truly, this was what Goddess wanted.  For women to be women, and men to be men.<br />
<br />

<br />
Eric parked his Mini in the driveway, then touched up his make-up, not wanting his wife to see that he had been crying.  Encountering Derrick helped a lot, but he was still shaken up by that woman on the treadmill.  He didn&#39;t want Laura to know about what happened.  He knew that it would upset her and with her current pregnancy, Eric didn&#39;t want to complicate things.<br />
<br />
Walking into their house, still wearing the sports bra and yoga pants that he had worn at the gym, he found his wife in the rec-room, sitting in her favorite reclining arm chair, watching TV.  It looked like some mindless action film.  Eric, like a lot of men, preferred romantic comedies, or just romance.  Upon entering the room, Eric became alarmed, seeing the bottle in his wife&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura, what is that?  You know you&#39;re not supposed to ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, babe,&quot; she said, holding it up.  &quot;It&#39;s just a coke.  I&#39;m not going to risk harming our baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric settled down, but still looked distraught, from earlier.  But it seemed that Laura didn&#39;t notice, fortunately.  Her eyes were glued to the TV once again.  Seeing that his 8-month pregnant wife was preoccupied, Eric headed to the mistress bedroom to change out of these clothes and into something more fitting for the house-husband that he was.<br />
<br />

<br />
Jake looked up from his computer, seeing some of the other secretaries walk by.  There was Peter, Mark, Joseph, and Ted, all dressed in very flattering dresses, blouses, and skirts, and of course high heels.  Mark click-clacked over to his desk.  &quot;The boys and I are heading out for an early lunch at Wendell&#39;s.  You coming, hon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, sorry.  Ms. Smith said she wanted to see me in her office,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s that promotion you always wanted,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe,&quot; Jake said, feeling more upbeat about missing lunch with his fellow secretaries.  It was something he looked forward to everyday, hanging out with the boys, eating salads, exchanging gossip, talking about celebrity news, and the latest fashions.  But a promotion sounded nice.  If that was what this was.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Ms. Smith called Jake into her office.  Like many women who worked there, the 40-something woman was dressed in a power suit.  She had a smile on her face, like usual.  Though if Jake&#39;s sister were there, she&#39;d see it as more of a leer.  As it turned out, Cindy was right, after all.  At least in the case of her brother.  Jake didn&#39;t get this job because of talent, but rather because he was attractive and liked to flaunt it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming so quickly, Jake,&quot; she said, chuckling at her own joke, though Jake didn&#39;t understand why it was funny.  &quot;I wanted to talk to you about ... expanding your job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was right!  Jake really WAS getting a promotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ll have to do something for me, in return,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s excitement dwindled a little.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, now.  You know EXACTLY what I mean,&quot; she said, her eyes roaming over her secretary&#39;s hot body.  She got up from her desk and walked straight towards Jake, then did something that shocked him.  She pulled down her pants and underwear, exposing herself to him.  &quot;You want this promotion?  You gotta earn it.  Now eat me out,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jake just stood there, stunned.  He was alone with this woman.  Everyone else had left for lunch.  What should he do?</p>
