<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oh damn. Jean says to herself. I got to pee. The baby is pressing hard on her bladder and she puts her hand <br />
under her belly as if to guide it into the bathroom and as she drops her stretch pants she can see her body <br />
and the angry red stretch marks running up the sides. Jean pulls up her shirt as she sits on the toilet <br />
realizing that she can no longer stand to pee and looks at herself as she relieves the pressure. Rubbing her <br />
belly and working her way up to her tits. She finds that her abdomen is very sensitive and when she gets to <br />
her nipples it sends a ripple of sensation unlike any other sensation she has ever had. It is such a pain that <br />
she finds herself going to the bathroom so much now but she finds herself so sensitive.<br />
<br />
As she pulls up her pants and pulls back her bra and shirt over her distended abdomen she throws her shoulders <br />
back and waddles out of her room to the kitchen because that baby is hungry and so is she.<br />
<br />
She finds Jay cooking breakfast for her. He sits her down and asks her what she wants this morning. He has <br />
found that she has been having wild cravings so what he has cooked may not be what she wants but she so often <br />
has something of what he has cooked. She looks at Jay in his apron and notices something interesting. It isn't <br />
that he is naked under the apron it is that his butt seems to be nice and round and juicy.<br />
<br />
Looking good there cutie she says flirting with him.<br />
<br />
Jay just laughs. So what do you want?<br />
<br />
Bacon and eggs and sausage and waffles sound good. Oh and lots and lots of syrup. Blueberry if you got it.<br />
<br />
How could I not have it for my best girl.<br />
<br />
He brought over a plate piled high for Jean. It looked like a platter.<br />
<br />
I can't eat all of this! Jean says astonished at the pile before her.<br />
<br />
No worries. Eat what you want and I will take care of what you don't eat.<br />
<br />
Jay sat down and there was almost a glint in his eye as he sat and watched Jean eat. Got to keep that baby <br />
healthy he would say.<br />
<br />
As Jean finished what she wanted she pushed the platter away and Jay asked what else she wanted.<br />
<br />
Nothing I am so stuffed I couldn't eat a thing. But damn I got to go pee again. Jean got up and waddled as <br />
fast as her legs could carry her to the bathroom next to the kitchen and when she emerged she saw Jay stuffing <br />
the rest of the platter in his mouth. Almost done honey. When the platter was empty he got up and washed the <br />
platter and all the cooking utensils and put them in the dish washer. <br />
<br />
Damn he is a nice house husband Jean said to herself. They sat and watched television all morning long and <br />
with every twitch or moan Jay would jump up and ask what she wanted. If he could get her anything. This was <br />
nice and Jean let him get her anything her hearts desired but damn that bladder was so touchy right now that <br />
she found herself rushing often to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Jay would put his arm around Jean's shoulder and Jean would let him get a feel of her mounded breasts enjoying <br />
the attention.<br />
<br />
When he left at about 2 for work she had a couple hours break before Dan came home with bags of Chinese in tow <br />
for dinner. And it was about time. She was so hungry.<br />
<br />
Were they trying to fatten her up? Jean thought to herself. But then she realized she liked the attention and <br />
they never pushed her to eat more than she wanted they just wanted her to have whatever she needed and that <br />
would probably fatten her up some. Just like breakfast and lunch Dan would sit there as Jay had and watch Jean <br />
eat. She would say here have some. You look hungry. But they would just sit there and watch her as she ate and <br />
then finish up the rest.<br />
<br />
It was at that point that she realized that both Jay and Dan were adding quite a bit of weight to their bodies <br />
like most husband did when their wife's became pregnant. Dan's suit was showing the tightness of a growing <br />
belly and Jean loosened up his white dress shirt and undid his tie and let loose the belly from it's confines.<br />
<br />
The months would show quite an effect on their bodies just as it was showing on hers but the difference was <br />
that she would lose a lot of it when she had the baby but they would have trouble losing the weight.<br />
<br />
Dan she found out had a nice office job and Jay worked at a gas station at night sitting up all night. She had <br />
two different men in her life but they gave her everything she needed.<br />
<br />
When the months passed and Jean went in to give birth both Jay and Dan were there to support her. And it was a <br />
total surprise when it wasn't just one but two babies. She had twins. Well sort of. Giving them a paternity <br />
test it showed that Jay was the father of one and Dan the father of the other. Which worked just fine for <br />
their unconventional life. Jay would be father during the day and Dan at night and it all worked out fine. <br />
Eventually they both moved into the same bedroom. And the few times that they would be there they really <br />
needed the king sized bed and Jean found she enjoyed being a woman. And being the meat in the Jay/Dan sandwich <br />
was nice. But that had the unfortunate effect of getting her pregnant again and again with twins just as her <br />
first pregnancy was.<br />
<br />
Jay and Dan just grew larger and larger lumbering around the house. It was nice to see Jay's ample rump in the <br />
morning cooking for her but then Dan coming home in his over sized suit turned her on too. There was no way <br />
she would ever be able to decide on one so they remained together.</p>
