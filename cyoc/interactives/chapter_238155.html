<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot; Wow! That was incredible but kind of uncomfortable inside the tub, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Luke said as he was hugging his wife now mermaid.<br />
“ Yeah it was, but we have bigger problems now. Staring with the fact that our son transforms into a merboy the moment he touches water. Then there is the issue that we can&#39;t have sex without triggering the transformation. Then there is the baby and will happen to it. “ Chloe said as she turned towards her husband Luke and return the hug.<br />
“ You right about everything you said but what do you say for starters to get out of the bathroom and go to eat something downstairs. We can&#39;t find a solution to our issue on an empty stomach. “ Luke said as he started to climb out of the tub.<br />
“Chloe and Luke flopped to the bathroom floor and used what dry towels were left to change back into humans. With a little patience, both had legs again and their eyes, muscles, and other characteristics above the waist returned to normal.<br />
Now both stumble a little to walk out of the bathroom, and they head off towards their bedroom to dress up. Chloe with a sports bra and panties and Luke with a boxer and a T-shirt. “ I&#39;ve got us a salad with some Parmesan cheese and tuna but also some macaroni with cheese. “ Chloe said to Luke as he smiled at her. <br />
Then they head down to the kitchen to eat. Chloe brought the macaroni and Luke some pieces of bread and then bought 2 glasses of water. As they were eating Luke said&quot; this is delicious and the salad taste great&quot; then she smirked a little and said &quot;Thank you, although that might be because of the tuna in the salad. It adds extra flavor in the mix. “ <br />
After they have done with the salad, they moved to the macaroni with cheese. “ Sooo about our problems, do you want to start about our sudden transformation while we were having sex in the tub &quot;. Chloe said as she took a bite. <br />
Luke looked at her and put his fork down without eating anything from his plate. “ To be honest I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s weird because when we started making out nothing happened at first. Not even our scales on our legs spread. They just stayed there, and we didn&#39;t transform unless… &quot;<br />
 “unless what?”<br />
“ Unless there is an actual trigger for the transformation that we don&#39;t know about &quot;<br />
“ Hmmm yeah there might be. Although that doesn&#39;t explain how Ethan transformed in tub &quot;<br />
“ True, we don&#39;t know that either. What we can agree on is that there is a trigger for you and me, but for Ethan is water. “ Ethan said as he grabbed his fork again.<br />
“ That&#39;s precisely how things are. As for our trigger, then it must be something similar to garlic against vampires ??? . “ Chloe said as she went into thinking.<br />
Meanwhile, Luke took a few bites from his macaroni and said, &quot; It&#39;s good, but it needs a little bit of salt &quot;<br />
“ Wait that must be the trigger. I&#39;m pretty, sure that&#39;s the one. &quot; <br />
&quot; How are you so sure??? &quot;<br />
&quot; Earlier when I was preparing the salad I accidentally dropped the salt on my leg and hands when you called me to come in the bathroom. &quot; <br />
&quot; Okay let&#39;s finish our dinner, clean a little and test your theory in the bedroom later and maybe go for another round in our comfy bed&quot; Luke said with a happy tone . <br />
&quot; Oh we could do that later. &quot; Chloe said looking directly in his eyes. <br />
After they ate they put the dishes in the dishwasher machine to clean them. They cleaned the bathroom and Chloe suggested to wait Luke in the bed while he grabbed the salt and a glass of water. Luke kissed her and headed downstairs while Chloe removed her sports bra and panties and lay nude on the bed enjoying the soft mattress below her and clean sheets. Just then Luke walled inside the bedroom with the glass of water on one hand and the salt on the other . He got hard almost immediately after laying eyes on her . &quot; Are you ready to test my theory darling &quot; Chloe said seductively. <br />
Luke waisted no time and got closer bed and left the salt and the glass of water on the bedside table. He removed his T-shirt and looked at his wife &quot;Are you ready&quot; Chloe nodded and closed her eyes for a second took a breath and opened them again. First Luke poured a bit of water on her thighs and feet. Both made sure once and for all that normal water does not affect them. Then the actual theory took place when Luke poured a handful of salt inside the glass of water and mixed it together by moving it slowly left and right. Chloe lifted her head and used her elbows to have a better view on her legs. Luke took a step back and poured all of it on Chloe&#39;s legs and both waited a couple of seconds and then her patch of scales started to spread all over her legs as they fused and her feet become fins while her bones reshaped to create a more flexible limb. Lastly the changes above the waist took place including the breast expansion which made Luke remove his underwear and show how hard he was currently for the second round. <br />
“ It seems my theory is true, and the trigger is saltwater and not water for us. Now that we cleared that do you care to join me in bed.&quot; Chloe said as she started to flick her tailfin a little. <br />
“ Yeah you were right from the beginning babe, but before I join you, allow me to try one more thing based on your theory. “ Luke said as he poured barely 2–3 droplets from what&#39;s left from the glass on his feet and waited. After a few minutes, nothing happened, and then he left the glass on the bedside table and climbed on top of Chloe and kissed her passionately while Chloe grabbed his hard cock and guided it to her pussy. It didn&#39;t take too long for Luke to start transforming into a merman since he had poured basically the entire glass of water on her. Now that both of them were transformed it was easier to move around in bed and have another incredible make out cession between them.</p>
