<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Who could have guessed that she would become a royal tier almost entirely on her own&quot; you thought to yourself. &quot;Now I am definitely going to keep her for my collection!&quot; How long has it been since you last had a royal tier slut?<br />
<br />
Every &quot;victim&quot; has a grade associated to their level of expertise in any area of sex. As long as they were excelling in any specific area, to an unordinary extent at that, they would be elevated to the &quot;royal tier&quot; ratings, from Baron to Goddess. While, these kinds of girls were very rare, especially the Goddess ranked ones which was practically a mythological rank given its frequency of appearance. But they were practically obvious once they appeared. It was very hard to miss one unless they fell into one of only a few &quot;categories&quot; of expertise. Mainly the ones that dealt with personality types were hard to recognize.<br />
<br />
Analice clearly was at least a dutchess rank cock sucker. And may even end up being an Empress or even a Goddess once she gets trained a bit. You have never seen someone with such a high level of compatibility with anything before. She was a natural savant at pleasing dicks.<br />
<br />
The reason as to why you felt she may end up a Goddess was because of 1 simple reason. Analice could use magic instinctivly. Of course, she was not aware of fhe fact that she could, but it was clear as day to you. <br />
<br />
The proof was in her ability to alter her own body and the size of the dildo. She likely felr that you were doing it to her. But you never did anything more than the origional magic to her.<br />
<br />
 She herself had made her own body capable of surviving without harming itself with a cock stuffed inside of her from her mouth to all the way down into the start of her large intestine. She was the one who gave herself full control over her throat, turned her stomach acid into an harmless, aphrodisiac like substance so that she wouldn&#39;t harm the cock. She made her jaw able to painlessly unhinge itself when she wants to take in a larger cock. She made herself no longer needing to breath when a cock was inserted into her. She was the one just now who made her tongue that long, simply off of a sudden whim. Hell, she was even reprogramming her own mind to believe she was being helped along by you, and that she was being changed because you wanted it. <br />
<br />
It was ironic. You origionally intended her to be an anal bitch, this her name Analice. But she ended up excelling it in the completely opposite end of her body. If you had known that, you would have named her Coral, or Suckii, maybe even Headia. <br />
<br />
Anyways, because she could use transformation magic subconsciously already, she could possibly become a Cock Sucking Goddess one day. It was very hard to learn to do magic with yohr subconscious. You had taken almost 20 years to do just the simplest of the bare minimum magics and were already considered a prodigy amongst the magic society. This girl didn&#39;t even know about magic and was already using highly advanced magic with the precision and attention to detail of an expert, all with her subconscious.<br />
<br />
If only the other 2 were gems like her. Stissy was unquestionably a commoner level girl. She had no inherent talent for anything specific. Generic as can be. She may have a slight talent for being an assistant, but that was hardly at a level of unordinary. Nope, she was destined to be just an ordinary set of holes for her future owner to fuck. Only able to be a person if they let her be one. Otherwise she would be no different than a living sexdoll, whose entire reason for existing is to pleasure her owner(s).<br />
<br />
Now, with Cliterry, nothing specifically stood out besides her constant refusal to accept her new situation. Always trying to at least appear to be &quot;fighting it&quot;, even though you knew she was beginning to love it when she was forced to do things. &quot;Hang on a moment!&quot; You thought. &quot;Isn&#39;t that in and of itself a specificly defined focus? She seems to at least have a talent in resisting your subtle guidances at least at the mental level. She was a completely broken mess at the end of yesterday&#39;s lesson wasn&#39;t she! But today she seems like that never even happened. She is not even close to being broken at all! That means she fully recovered in just a single night! She was a Breaker Girl, or a girl who pretended to resist or who would put up a front in order for their user to try harder to break them. These masochists  loved the experience of being broken repeatedly. You had almost missed it because it was a personality type of specialty. <br />
<br />
You were elated once again. Of course you did your best to not show it though. You had 2 royal tiers! Analice who could become a cock sucking goddess. And Cliterry who was at least a Countess tier &quot;breaker girl&quot; since it only took a single night to recover her mind back to normal. If she could control her own recovery rate, then she should have no issue becomming a Duchess, or even a Queen tiered Breaker Girl.<br />
<br />
You decided then and there that you were going to adopt these two. What the heck, may as well keep Stissy around too as a maid or as your sextoy. Since the 3 of them knew each other from before they met you, her being around may make it easier for those two to improve their abilities. And if not, then at least she could clean up all of the cum after their lessons. Either way, keeping her around wouldn&#39;t be a negitive. She was kind of fun to chat with too. Were you perhapse taking a liking to her? She was a very sociable girl, but sadly, sociability wasn&#39;t one of the categories to be judged by. <br />
<br />
As you thought about it, maybe Analice wasnt a cock sucker, but was instead a magical adapter? Or maybe even both? Not that it mattered much. Cock suckers were just as popular as adapters were, not that you ever planned on getting rid of her though.</p>
