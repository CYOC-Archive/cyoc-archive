<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that Dillon was alone in his living room after dealing with his landlord and mother, it was time to focus more on his own body. Dillon was probably wondering to change to a full lizard knowing the two other people affected by the ring had specific changes for one species, but he didn’t want specific for himself. He wanted to be more unique, experimental, something that he could really play around with. Turning his mom into a pegasus centaur just shows he can be anything himself, so why not have fun with it. So many ideas flew through his mind at once. <br />
<br />
“So, how would I become the perfect freak of nature?” Dillon scratched his chin with his muscular arm. Then, inspiration hit. “I will grow two additional arms as muscular as these… and, any changes I make further will adjust my clothes to my new form.” For once he remembers to keep his cloths in mind despite his excitement. Not a moment later the ring reacted and Dillon felt jabbing pressure from his shoulder blades. No pain, but heavy pressure in which his cloths were getting tighter as two large lumps started growing out. Lucky the ring listened since his shirt had not ripped, but developed additional sleeves to fit his new appendages through. Dillon could still feel the extension of his bones growing out his back with the addition of developing joints as well as muscles. The feeling was invigorating. “Yes! So much power!” His new arms reached the same length as his originals and new hand palms started forming at the tip, with every finger extending out with a bone crunching sound. It was to much not to flex and stretch for Dillon. When his fingers finally gained the muscle needed to move, he closed his eyes and flexed his front arms within his pecs, and his new back arms flexed outward his shoulders. “Yeah! Oh… that’s what I’m talking about.” Dillon said opening his eyes to the mirror in his living room. Not only was he a beefcake with a chameleon tail, but he had not two, but four massive arms to complement his figure. Even his tail flexed out he was feeling himself so much.<br />
<br />
“Cool! What else?” Dillon’s adrenaline was starting to kick in with every change he made to himself. “How about more animal stuff… I will grow a long elephant trunk with tusks!” Once again, the ring reacted, and Dillon felt twitching in his nose. The same pressure that was applied through every other change was now going through his nose, making his nostrils flare and extending out further. “Ah… so cool!” He says as his nose stretches out and the skin starts turning to a rough grey texture. Dillon felt his bones and muscles extend within his nose as it grew longer and wider, and becoming more flexible with every inch. With his trunk reaching two feet long, he felt his mouth tense up as his upper maulers started growing. Dillon could feel them extending, sharpening into large tusks that practically hung off his upper lip. Dillon smiled in the mirror, while flexing his trunk up as it grew to its full length of three feet. The rough grey texture of his trunk stopped at the base of his nose which basically smoothly transitions to his skin tone. “And now I have six limbs I can use as arms!” Dillon said astounded at his change.<br />
<br />
Dillon thought he’d do one more thing before stopping, of course he’d want to make more changes to his body, but he didn’t want to overdo the excitement. He realized that the continued changes were making him ever so horny hence the pitched tent in his pants. “Alright, one more thing… How about horns… Ram horns!” Dillon saw the ring glow as he felt more pressure at the top of his head. He had felt his skull reshaping from within as two bumps of skin protrude from both sides. “Oh! Here they come!” He says closing his eyes from the pressure extorting from his head. He had to see what the growth looked like, so he squinted his eyes open to see the bumps start showing to pointed bony structures. “That.. just looks awesome!” He continues to admire the proceeding changes as not only did the bones grow longer, but they started curving back. With every bone cracking noise, he could feel his new extending horns grow with every inch as the base of the horns started growing thicker and wider that it almost weighed Dillon’s head down, but his muscles were big enough to keep him level. “Feels… so… good…. So… nice…” With his package stiffening, his trunk swaying, and his tail lashing side to side like a dogs, Dillon could almost swear his pants were about to burst open. “Oh God!” With a surge of energy, his horns started to spiral out of his head causing him to finally let loose. Dillon collapsed to his knees as the button on his jeans had finally burst as his zipper slid down and his cock slid out the top of his spandex letting out a stream of cum. Dillon rubbed his erection with his trunk to try and calm himself. He learned of a new emotion, as his tail seemed to be white as the cum he’d let loose. “Huh, so that’s the color of horny.” He wasn’t proud of it, but it felt good to finally let it out.<br />
<br />
Dillon finally looked at his new form. Sliding his dick back into his spandex, he looked at himself with glee. A massive muscular frame, big strong ram horns that curled back, a large trunk with powerful dusks, two sets of massive arms, and a long flexible chameleon tail shimmering with white scales. “I can’t believe this is me… and to think I changed reality to make people think this is normal.” He used his back set of arms to feel his ram horns along with is trunk, and his front arms to feel the base of his tail. He had to take in every feeling of his new form. “Hm… the night is still young, and I want to feel this body out… and maybe even change a few lives as well.” Dillon looked at the ring and grinned. He was finally ready to reveal who he truly was to the world… well, after he got new pants on.</p>
