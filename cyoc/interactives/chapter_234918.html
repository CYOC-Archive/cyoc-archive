<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allison falls deeply into sleep, dreaming away a magical dream. She was riding a luscious white unicorn, seeing giant toys in a clear light blue sky. After a while of riding, Allison gets off the unicorn to see and feel the fluffy cloud on the ground. Allison gets on the ground and starts making a cloud angel for a few minutes. After making her perfect angel, she looks up to see a a small table with a bottle of baby milk, and feeling very drenched all of the sudden, Allison crawls over to the table. After getting at the table, she grabs the bottle from the table, and starts sucking on the nipple the hardest she ever could have, tasting the delicious warm milk. After finishing what seemed like a limitless milk, Allison lays back onto the cloud ground, seeing a white light slowly consuming with a sudden vibration noise.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in reality, Allison is drooling a lot, with the pacifier she never put on while sleeping still attached to her shirt. Allison hears a notification sound of her friend Bailey saying, &quot;Allieee,&quot; along with a vibration sound. Allison started smiling, but not blushing like the sound with her mom&#39;s. She starts getting up, feeling refreshed and happy with a minor yawn, before she notices two things which makes her feel uncomfortable. One, her drooling has gotten all over her chin, lips, and cheeks, and two, her now super warm and squishier diaper, which was not making her horny at all. &quot;Ugggh, I must of had more in me than I thought,&quot; Allison said in a tired high voice, before grabbing her pacifier back in her mouth and sucking on it. She opens her phone to see a text from her friend Bailey, reading, &quot;Heyyy Baby, wanna go out? I&#39;ll take you out to a froyo shop, my treat!&quot; Allison assumes that &#39;Baby&#39; must be her nickname in this reality, but still smiling behind the pacifier from that and the idea of some frozen yogurt being in her stomach. Allison types back, &quot;Yeahhh, let&#39;s go in an hour or so!&quot; and puts away her phone as she starts to slowly stand up to put her fingerprint against the lock. After unlocking her crib poll, Allison starts waddling over to the bathroom. When in the bathroom, she sees nothing too much has changed in here, other than baby bath products and baby-like medicine. Allison opens the same drawer where the small towels were, and started rubbing her face against the nice soft fabric. After cleaning herself up from the saliva, she hears the notification from Bailey again. Opening up her phone, she reads, &quot;Okay! I&#39;ll see you in an hour, don&#39;t forget your &#39;purse!&#39;&quot; Allison was a little confused from that message, but she immediately thought of the diaper bag-like purse she saw in the living room.<br />
<br />
Still with a childish smile behind the pacifier, Allison starts walking downstairs and grabs that diaper bag that her friend must be talking to her about. She opens it to see some wipes, diaper rash cream, a small baby powder bottle and a large towel which she doesn&#39;t know the usage for, and in the side pocket does she see her pink wallet and baby-colored keys. Allison thinks of the necessities she might need for this visit, and naturally, she waddles over to the kitchen. Over to the drawer of burp towels and bibs, Allison grabbed one of each to put into the purse. She opens a big shelf she never opened before, seeing some stored dry food and some premade snack bags and small tubs of baby formula, assuming it would be for situations like this. She grabbed a decently-sized bag of some cereal, and put that into the purse along with some baby formula. Then she waddles back to the shelf with the bottles and nipples, and grabs one of each into the purse, but she reaches high to grab a thermal bottle, something she didn&#39;t noticed before. She poured some warm water into it, sealed it, and then put it into the purse.<br />
<br />
Allison waddles out of the kitchen and up to her bedroom for one thing only. She gets to her changing table, and grabs a couple pairs of diapers, despite not wanting to get changed from going back to her initial reality which would make her a laughing stock. But she pulls out a pair of white frilly socks, and a pair of pink light-up sneakers, and puts them on before leaving her room. After being done in her bedroom, Allison waddles over to the bathroom, and notices the light-up coming from her shoes, which makes her giggle a little, and starts stomping around to see her lights. After her playful time with her shoes, Allison pulls a drawer out to grab some basic sunscreen to apply over her arms and face. After she applied her sunscreen, she put it in the purse just in case. Allison waddles downstairs to the front of the door. She took in a deep breath, and took the confidence to step outside in her babyish look. After locking the door with the pink key she just knew would be the right key needed, Allison saw something on the front lawn that was definitely going to help get to the froyo shop fast. She saw a pink tricycle, with pink streamers on the handlebars, a silver bell, and a pink woven basket. Allison gets on the tricycle, which would feel comfy if not for the super wet diaper, puts her purse inside the basket, and starts peddling over to the froyo shop. As she was peddling away, Allison started to tear up a bit, mostly from the uncomfortable diaper she didn&#39;t want to take off, but she did hear some &quot;Awww,&quot; from random strangers, which made her slightly smile and feel happy.<br />
<br />
After some time, Allison eventually got to the froyo shop, before Bailey appears. So Allison just peddles off to one of the outdoor tables, and sat on the table next to her tricycle. After a few minutes, Allison sees Bailey&#39;s car pull up, and smiles in excitement to see her friend. Bailey walks out of her car, and starts walking over to Allison. &quot;Aww Allie, it&#39;s been a bit!&quot; Bailey coos, as she hugs her friend softly with firm, &quot;Man, I forgot how soft your skin is!&quot; Allison pops out her pacifier, &quot;Oh well, you know with my bathing and good skin products.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah, I know, but let&#39;s get some froyo first, then we can continue talking!&quot; With excitement in her throat, she yells, &quot;FROYO!&quot; with a childish laugh afterwards. They walked inside, and Bailey got both Allison and herself some good froyo with bits of small treats in them. After getting their froyo, Allison and Bailey both sat down, with Allison still feeling discomfort on the seat with her diaper. While caught up in the thought, Bailey says, &quot;Hey, Allie, can I..?&quot; as Allison, hearing Bailey and instinctively knowing what she is requesting for, responds, &quot;Okayyy,&quot; and gives Bailey her froyo. Bailey walks over to her diaper bag in the basket to grab and put on Allison&#39;s bib, and grabs a spoonful of Allison&#39;s froyo, saying in a light silly tone, &quot;Here comes with airplane...&quot; This makes Allison laugh softly while opening her mouth, as Bailey puts her froyo into her mouth. Allison, tasting new flavors of sweetness and cold, blushes very hard and started squealing in joy as she shallows up her first bite, as Bailey replies, &quot;Aww, so cuteee.&quot; Bailey and Allison do this for another few scoops, making Allison blush and enjoy her froyo a lot, until Bailey stops it and starts getting into her froyo while letting Allison start eating her own.<br />
<br />
After another few scoops, the conversation continues. &quot;Sooo Bailey,&quot; Allison starts, &quot;I&#39;ve been a &#39;Baby&#39; for a long time, huh?&quot; &quot;As long as I knew you, back in second grade of course. Why, are you going to try to &#39;grow up?&#39;&quot; Bailey asks. &quot;No, no of course not, just been thinking on a couple things,&quot; Allison retorts, as she eats another scoop, &quot;Say Bailey, let&#39;s play a silly game.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; Bailey says back, with some froyo still being in her mouth. Allison continues, &quot;Let&#39;s say I just lost my memories before today,&quot; Bailey nods her head with a &#39;Uh huh&#39; sound as she eats another scoop, &quot;And I just gotten my consciousness today, so you have to answer my questions about my past.&quot; Bailey finishes eating up her scoop as she responds, &quot;That sounds interesting, go ahead Allie, I&#39;m intrigued.&quot; &quot;So I just grew up being a baby?&quot; Allison asks, before hearing a &quot;Yup!&quot; from Bailey. &quot;And nobody questions it, like whatsoever?&quot; Allison asks. &quot;Well, weirdly no. I actually don&#39;t know how, but it&#39;s like magically we just adore and think you&#39;re cute like a real baby.&quot; &quot;Hmm...,&quot; Allison thinks while half blushing from the &#39;magically&#39; part from that the comment, &quot;Well, am I considered an adult?&quot; Bailey then proceeds to grab out her set of metallic keys, and starts jangling them in front of Allison, which makes Allison excited and giggle a bit, as she tries to grab the keys. Bailey abruptly pulls them back and replies, &quot;Does that answer your question? Look, you may be able to care for yourself and hold responsibilities like us, but in every other aspect, you are just like my baby twin brothers. You don&#39;t understand how it feels to handle 3 babies in my life Allie, including you!&quot; Bailey chuckles, in which Allison follows with rosy cheeks in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now let me ask you something,&quot; Bailey asks. After eating a spoonful, Allison feels pretty bloated again, and nods her head in slight pain while rubbing her back. &quot;Do you need a change? Your diaper looks bigger than usual, and your face is looking a bit red,&quot; Bailey asks. This causes sudden fear in Allison, and she quickly responds, &quot;NO BAILEY, I DO NOT-&quot; and before she finishes herself, she had a bad baby burp, one that got her spit and some of the froyo all over her face, bib, and even a little bit on the table, and as Allison had her baby burp, feeling the body pain from it, Allison suddenly feels her bowels very much full. She knew what was going to happen, she really didn&#39;t want to do it here, of all places, but the diaper was in full control against her will. Allison gets off her chair, and gets herself in a squatting position on the concrete floor against her body controls, as she starts pushing on her bowels, making a couple loud toots. After the gas though, she filled herself so hard, and Allison could tell the excrement was very wet and messy in there. After a solid minute of wet voiding, she got up from her squatting position, and got back onto her chair, sitting in her nasty, wet waste.<br />
<br />
Allison was turning really red, she could just tell from her hot-feeling face, and her tears were flowing down hard now, holding herself a shred away from breaking down. &quot;Allie, let&#39;s take you to the bathroom to clean you up, and...&quot; Bailey talks as Allison hears less and lesser of her speaking. After hearing the last thing that Allison doesn&#39;t want to happen to her, she lost all control. Allison starting crying verbally loud, with no control on herself, crying, &quot;Mama! MAMA!&quot; Bailey was feeling the eyes distinctly looking at them after Allison crapped herself, but now they were on them really hard. Grabbing Allison&#39;s hands and her purse in Allison&#39;s tricycle basket, Bailey exclaims with a forced chuckle, &quot;Alright Baby, let&#39;s get you changed!&quot; before running with Allison to the women&#39;s bathroom. With little to no hesitation, Allison blindly follows Bailey through her tears and cries for her mom. After going into the bathroom, Bailey takes the disability toilet space, and puts Allison on the toilet, as she takes her purse and looks at the contents inside. After pulling out some stuff, Bailey pulls out the large towel Allison didn&#39;t know the purpose of, and lays it on the floor. As Bailey grabs the diaper, baby powder, and wipes out and getting ready for the change, Allison stopped yelling out loud for her Mom, but she was still heavy on the tears with her still red face, sniffing and sobbing hard.<br />
<br />
As Bailey got everything all ready, she unbuttons Allison&#39;s overalls and has them go down to her ankles, showing off her very much used diaper, and gets her laying on the towel, ready to change her. &quot;Alright Allie, I&#39;m gonna change you...&quot; Bailey says in her light silly tone to potentially calm down Allison, but it only made it worse for her. Allison tries fighting back, throwing a physical tantrum in fear of turning back in an awkward situation, yelling, &quot;NO NO NO!&quot; but only after 15 seconds did she tire herself out, and lay still for Bailey to do the change. Bailey opens up the diaper, and Allison prepares herself mentally for the worst moment in her entire life. As Bailey opens it wide, she sniffs and makes a disgusted face, &quot;Oh man Allie, I would cry too if I had to wear this, this looks and even smells awful, oh my!&quot; as Allison just knows the magic is going away, making her friend see the feces and urine of a friend wearing a diaper all day, which makes her embarrassed. Bailey grabs some wipes and cleans up her messy areas, which makes Allison stiffen a bit from the coldness of the wipes. After a minute of doing that, and throwing the wipes away in a nearby trash bin, Bailey grabs the diaper under Allison, and cleans up the rest of her butt. As her ass is fully clean, Allison is only still prepared in explaining what Bailey is doing to her butt back in her old reality, but Bailey softly says, &quot;Wow, you do not have a rash at all, you are a lucky girl Allie.&quot; She then just goes straight to the baby powder, as she puts some on her hand and rubs it all over her areas, making Allison giggle a little. After the powder, Bailey grabs the diaper, and starts putting it on Allison. Allison, now with a tear-soaked with some froyo, spit, and snot face and calm but slightly reddened eyes, looks down to see as Bailey straps the diaper against her abdomen, the diaper slowly forms the front image of the same puppy face she saw on her magic diaper, as the diaper changes hue to the same light blue and feeling the diaper becoming puffier and thicker. As the diaper is fully strapped, Bailey picks Allison up, grabs the overalls to rebutton Allison, and puts her back on the toilet, &quot;There, now you got a diaper change, don&#39;t you feel better now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mentally, Allison was still shocked. Somehow, throughout the whole changing process, Allison did not lost the magic affecting the whole situation, and got a new magic diaper on her again, all without Bailey noticing anything different. Without questioning it at all to look suspicious, Allison abruptly hugs Bailey, and says in her baby impression, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Bailey, being taken back from the sudden movement, simply hugs her back and says softly, &quot;No problem Baby,&quot; which made Allison blush slightly. As the hug was broken, Bailey exclaims, &quot;Wait!&quot; as she goes through Allison&#39;s diaper bag to grab a barf towel, and cleans up Allison&#39;s face, &quot;Now you&#39;re all good!&quot; Allison completely forgot about the burp mess, but she smiled harder than usual with the diaper, she just felt so much better, and was grateful her friend cleaned her up well. After Bailey put away Allison&#39;s things back into her purse and threw away the super smelly diaper in a bigger trash bin, they both walked back to the table where they were at, and Allison puts away her purse back into her tricycle&#39; basket. Now slightly melted, they both continued eating their froyos,<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to continue the questions, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Allison asks, with a nod given back from Bailey, &quot;So, isn&#39;t this like expensive for my parents to keep me being a baby?&quot; Bailey finishes up her scoop, &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t know your family&#39;s financial situation, but I did heard recently they did get a huge pay raise, so maybe your parents are richer than even you think.&quot; &quot;Makes sense,&quot; Allison replies back, as she eats another scoop, &quot;Have I done anything, like an adult?&quot; Bailey blushes a bit, as she finishes her last scoop, &quot;Well, mostly through our sleepovers, yes a bit. Won&#39;t forget the time when you let me massage your breasts and finger you during your diaper change. I mean, the last sleepover we had, I got you to straight up wear a strap on with your diaper on, gave me one hell of a good time.&quot; Allison blushed even harder, she didn&#39;t knew she would be so intimidate with her friend who is being her guardian right now. &quot;But I mean,&quot; Bailey continues as Allison finishes her last scoop, &quot;You are an adult with a baby-like mind, I&#39;d assume you just get randomly horny and like, hump a doll or something.&quot; &quot;yeah...&quot; Allison quietly responds, as she remembers her dry humping her stuffed animal before passing out a few hours earlier. &quot;Well, any other questions with this game?&quot; Bailey asks boldly, pretending the last question didn&#39;t happen. &quot;No, I think I had my fun with this game!&quot; Allison replies with a big smile. &quot;Good, cause I think I need to go back to check on my actual baby siblings,&quot; Bailey replies, as she gets up to walk to the trash bin outside, with Allison following her actions. After getting back to their table, Allison says kindly, &quot;Thank you for the froyo, and the... clean up,&quot; as she blushes pretty hard, &quot;It was making me cranky a bit.&quot; &quot;Of course Allie!&quot; Bailey responds back, &quot;I made not be your sibling or anything, but you are Baby to me too,&quot; as Bailey pitches Allison&#39;s now rosy cheeks and gives her another soft yet firm hug. They then said their farewells, as Bailey walks back to her car and Allison takes off the bib Bailey put on her earlier to put it back to her purse and grab the sunscreen to reapply to her skin. As Bailey&#39;s car drove off, Allison puts her pacifier back into her mouth, starts sucking on it, gets back on her tricycle, now enjoying the comfy seat that all the urine before made it otherwise, and peddles back home, hearing some more &quot;Aww,&quot; from people which makes her blush just like earlier.<br />
<br />
After some time, Allison gets back to her front lawn, and grabs her purse back as she waddles away from her tricycle. Using the pink key she used earlier, Allison waddles into her house, slightly tired, but still feeling fulfilled going out and talking to her friend. She opens the bag to grab everything that she grabbed earlier before leaving the house, only leaving the wipes, diaper rash cream, small baby powder, and the large towel in her purse. After hanging the purse up back where it was, Allison starts putting her contents away, the sunscreen in the bathroom, the unused diaper in her bedroom, along with untying her light-up shoes and taking off both her shoes and her socks, and the used bib and burp towel in the kitchen. She left the cereal bag, baby bottle, nipple, and thermal bottle out because Allison was wanting to have a snack.<br />
<br />
After pouring the still warm water from the thermal bottle into her baby bottle, portioning the baby formula mix in her the bottle, and putting on the nipple and a light shake, Allison plops down, laying on the couch, pops out her pacifier, starts drinking her baby milk in her laying state, and then snacks on the dry cereal after her milk, leaving a cereal mess all over the floor. As she was enjoying her still delicious milk and her new love towards this dry cereal, Allison was still thinking about the diaper situation. Why did it still work despite being not on her body, and how did Bailey not notice anything different during the change? Allison was thinking if maybe she can only take off the &#39;magic&#39; to revert everything back to normal, but she was still loving the baby experience and doesn&#39;t want to take the diaper off herself until at least the following morning. As Allison was somewhat deep into thought, she realized the bag with her dry cereal was completely empty, with a decent-sized mess on the floor. So Allison gets up, waddles to the kitchen, crushing on the dry cereal on the floor in the process, and throws away the bag in the trash bin, and then puts up the baby bottle, nipple, and thermal bottle on the counter. Allison then waddles back on the couch, and plops again, lying down, thinking about how she was going to spend the rest of the night.</p>
