<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The school day was mostly normal. She had some classes with Sarah as usual. She did find some things had changed. her sense of smell had increased. As such chemistry class was harder as she had to filter out the smells of the chemicals.  <br />
<br />
then lunchtime came around. She ate a balanced meal however she soon found she now preferred meat. the biggest change was in gym class. of course, she was by no means bad in that class. however, it seemed to be easier, especially in running and strength-based parts.  <br />
<br />
after school, Sarah asked if they could go back to where Kira had found the totem. while she didn&#39;t want to admit she felt more powerful she did not want her friend to share this curse. &quot;well... I found it on a whim honestly. how about I try to find it again myself? then when I do we can go back.&quot; she said to her friend.  <br />
<br />
&quot;but what if you don&#39;t find it?&quot; Sarah asked as they came to Kira&#39;s house. &quot;Then I&#39;ll try again till I do&quot; While it be the truth later Kira had no intention of going back after returning the totem. after they said their goodbyes Kira went inside. immediately she went to her room and got the totem. &quot;sorry about this but I don&#39;t want this&quot; She found it odd she was talking to it like it was alive.  <br />
<br />
Kira also felt guilty about taking it back. however, she couldn&#39;t live with that other version of herself. the moment she touched the totem again she found herself in her transformed state. sighing she left her house. She walked for some time trying to find the creek she found earlier.  <br />
<br />
however, when she got to where she had first spotted the creek there was nothing but trees and bushes. She tried to find it for some time. she then noticed the sun and realized her mom would be home soon. she ran back to her house and entered. placing the totem back on the dresser she heard her mom enter the house.  <br />
<br />
focusing on her human form she went downstairs to greet her. After dinner, she went upstairs to do her nightly routine. looking at a picture on the wall she felt her heart grow heavy. it showed her and her mom alongside another person. her father was a great man.  <br />
<br />
Sadly a month after the photo was taken he died in a car accident on a wet road. the house just felt empty now that he was gone. sometimes she wondered if her mom wanted a new man of the house. she hadn&#39;t been on any dates but the thought hung with Kira. outside of her friends and school, she was actually a bit of a tomboy. <br />
<br />
She was just too embarrassed to reveal it to anyone, even her mother. her father was the only one she ever confided it to. That was why they went on so many camping trips and nature hikes. she sometimes wondered if she should have been born a boy. shaking herself out of her thoughts she went back to her routine for the night.  <br />
<br />
after it was all done she went to bed. She soon found herself unable to sleep. She remembered she felt more comfortable in her beast form. closing her eyes she felt herself change. sighing she pulled the covers over her.  <br />
<br />
this caused some small tears in the sheet. soon she fell asleep once again. like last night the totem&#39;s eyes glowed so bright. it bathed the entire room as its power went into Kira&#39;s sleeping form. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
waking up Kira rose. She heard her bed creak more than normal. she was jolted awake at the sight of her hand. her hand was larger than yesterday. She saw her nails had darkened and gotten sharper.  <br />
<br />
skin on her palm was slightly pushing outwards loosely resembling pads. Additionally, more dull yellow hair fur now was on her body. getting out of her bed she went to her dresser&#39;s mirror. looking at her face she saw it was even more like her favorite animal. her ears had moved upwards somewhat and had become larger.  <br />
<br />
they were now completely covered in dull yellow fur with fuzzy insides. the dull yellow fur now completely covered the area around her face. on her short muzzle white fur grew. her nose was now that of a feline. her eyebrows had thickened so that they could be seen amidst the short forest surrounding them.  <br />
<br />
her canines were now fangs and her other teeth were sharper. the most noticeable thing was her hair. it had to be twice as large as her human version. besides the lion&#39;s characteristics, her face also looks masculine slightly. looking down at her body she saw the same was true for the rest of her muscles were starting to fill out her hourglass figure.  <br />
<br />
the dirty blond hair had grown larger under her arms and chest. speaking of which her breasts looked smaller. it could be from the meaty pecs pushing out behind them. her nighttime crop top and shorts were now further away from each other showing off her muscular stomach. looking down she gulped.  <br />
<br />
her pubic bush had grown larger as well and a treasure trail began to form. however, what got her was the two bulges in her jeans. above her unchanged rear was a furry bulge. she could just tell it was theirs before it snaked down her shorts. said shorts now stretching almost painfully tights showing off her panties.  <br />
<br />
the front however concerned her more. the button on her jean shorts broke and the zipper was down. now the only thing between the bulge and fresh air was her underwear. her ankles now raised more as her right foot now had four toes. the other one looked like it was merging with the next toe.  <br />
<br />
remembering what happened yesterday she closed her eyes and focused on her human form. after she was her old self her jeans and fell to the floor. her panties now looser on her hips. even her crop top felt stretched out. &quot;okay I&#39;m gonna have to head out to the mall after school.&quot; she said before looking at the statue.  <br />
<br />
&#39;if I can&#39;t return it to the cave, then I can be at least prepared for what it does&#39; she thought. looking it over she could almost swear its eyes were more dull, as if its life was going into her. however, she knew it was ridiculous to think that. A thought momentarily came to her about destroying it or throwing it away. though that could make things worse.  <br />
<br />
it could curse her more or curse whoever found it. she then decided to leave her room. she was unaware of a figure hiding in the forest looking into her window. &quot;soon the moon will be full and the gift will be complete&quot; it smiled as it vanished.</p>
