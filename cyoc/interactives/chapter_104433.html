<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon and Devon kept chuckling as they talked about how they would change Cody. &quot;Yeah man, lets make him a total hair ball dude! Back, shoulders, the works!&quot; Devon suggested while laughing. &quot;Hey that&#39;s not a bad idea!&quot; Simon answered, his arms behind his head showing his impressive thatch of pit hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got an idea bro!&quot;, Devon said as he pulled out his phone. &quot;Cody doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m a jock. He will trust me&quot;.<br />
<br />
Devon tapped on his phone and sent a text to Cody. &quot;Hello Cody. Would you like to come over to my house today to work on our science project?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cody responded a few seconds later; &quot;Sure, I can be at your house in an hour&quot;.<br />
<br />
Simon and Devon grinned at each other with their scruffy faces and high fived each other. They paid for their pizza and hurried to Devon&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Cody knocked for a minute or so before letting himself in. &quot;hello?&quot;, he called in his squeaky high voice. He slowly made his way to Devon&#39;s room. As he entered he was hit with a foul smell. Body odor and locker room. Gross! But before Cody had time to react a big sweaty hairy arm grabbed him from behind and covered him mouth.<br />
<br />
He was pinned to the ground quite easily. &quot;Don&#39;t scream or we will break your arm, Cody&quot;. Devon said. Devon&#39;s voice was so deep and rumbling Cody didn&#39;t recognize it. &quot;Okay just don&#39;t hurt me. I wont scream. Devon let go of him and let Cody take stock of the situation. Two very hairy and muscular jocks were in Devon&#39;s room. One was blocking the door and one was grinning at him with his arms folded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Recognize me, Cody?&quot;, Devon asked. It took him a minute and then it clicked; &quot;Devon? Is that you? How did you get so big and hairy?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Devon grinned; &quot;why don&#39;t we show you!&quot;. Simon grabbed Cody and pinned him against the wall. A wave of stink rolled from Simons pits and made Cody gasp. &quot;Were going to make you a football jock like us&quot;. Cody protested quite strongly. &quot;NO! I dont want to be a smelly jock like you! I dont care what happened to you. Anything but this, please!&quot;. The two jocks just laughed.<br />
<br />
Devon lifted his arm quite playfully, exposing his clumps of brown armpit hair. &quot;I bet you want pits like these, don&#39;t you?&quot;. Devon grabbed Cody&#39;s hand and guided it to his exposed pit. He rubbed Cody&#39;s hand through the pit hair. &quot;Feel how much hair there is. How thick the hairs are. You could have this, and more&quot;. He guided Cody&#39;s hand under his nose and made cody smell it. It had picked up Devon&#39;s rank body odor and the smell made Cody sick. He couldn&#39;t imagine his body producing such offensive scents!<br />
<br />
Devon nodded at Simon and Simon lifted up both of Cody&#39;s arms. &quot;Were going to make you a hairball, Cody. First step is the pits!&quot;. Cody started protesting, and when he found that was ineffective, he began to cry.<br />
<br />
Devon popped the cap off the deodorant and began to smear it all over Cody&#39;s pits. Small hairs began to emerge, squirming out getting thicker and darker. The hairs curled and twisted together, becoming quite an impressive bush. The deodorant stick matted down the bush but Devon kept going. Devon finally relented when Cody had a incredibly thick and messy brown bush under his arm. It would stick out from both sides even with his arm at his sides; there was no hiding this. Devon then applied the same treatment to Cody&#39;s other pit. Simon let Cody go and Cody lifted his arm and began to weep. He was a freak! He had huge messy bushes under his arm forever now! Gross!<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go man! Pit fur is a good first step. In no time your going to be a sweaty smelly football fucking machine like us!&quot;. Cody shuttered at the thought while absentmindedly scratching his new bushes. So gross.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now cody, you&#39;ll notice your pits don&#39;t smell. Don&#39;t worry. They will son enough!&quot;. Without warning, Simon covered Cody&#39;s mouth with his large powerful hand. Devon lifted his arm and slowly forced Cody&#39;s face into the smelly tangled jungle of pit hair. Cody was more disgusted than he had been in his whole life. Cody held his breath as long as possible, but he knew he would have to give in. Cody felt his nose being pushed and smeared through the greasy wet bush, and he shuddered in disgust. Cody finally relented and took a deep breath. He retched from the smell, and he became very light headed. He took a second breath and it was still terrible. It was the worst b.o. he had ever felt. Cody then noticed his new bushes were wet. Uh oh, he thought. After about a minute, cody was released from the putrid prison.<br />
<br />
Simon and Devon laughed and waved their hands in front of their noses. &quot;Bro, I we over did it. You smell worse than us!&quot;. Cody lifted up his arm and stuck his nose in his new bush. He was assaulted with a very pungent odor. Gross! That&#39;s what he smelled like now! Forever! He felt absolutely crushed. His face flushed red and the two jocks taunted him. &quot;Your going to need a deodorant budget!&quot;, cracked Simon. &quot;Yeah, and your gonna be taking 3 showers a day from hahaha!, Devon laughed.<br />
<br />
Simon and Devon composed themselves, looked at Cody who was crying to himself. &quot;He is still a little bitch. What should we change next?&quot;.</p>
