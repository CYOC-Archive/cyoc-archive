<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate was searching through pictures of large dogs until he came across a picture of the perfect one. It made sense, since he loved the Disney movies so much. He enlarged the picture on the computer to ensure that this was the last one he would see, the one he would have firmly in his minds eye as he picked up the amulet, the sapphire dog paw print facing him. He turned the dial one click to the right and checked the directions to make sure that was correct. Satisfied, he placed the gold chain around his neck, the amulet landing around mid-chest for him, brushing against his t-shirt. He paused for one more moment, wondering if he really dared do this. He shrugged his shoulders, figuring it was all a gag. He lifted up the amulet and placed it under his shirt, pressing the sapphire paw print against his chest. <br />
<br />
To his immediate shock, he felt the described burning sensation as the medallion touched his skin. He let go of the medallion as it swing between his bare chest and the inside of his shirt. He began to get very scared as he wondered what he had just done to himself. He got up and walked to the bathroom, flipping on the light. Nothing was different, not a single thing. He looked over himself very carefully before flipping off the light and going back to the living room. He could still feel a tingle from the amulet and pulled it out, noticing that the jewels were glowing. He wondered if there was some sort of buzzer or something in it. Still, it seemed pretty cool so he placed it back under his shirt and sat back on the couch, turning on the T.V. As he flipped through the channels, he started to feel itchy. He scratched the itch, at the base of his scalp and then his back and then his chest. It suddenly dawned on him. <br />
<br />
Nate shot up off the couch and went back into the bathroom. He saw the outline of his reflection in the mirror and reached slowly out towards the light switch, equal parts excited and scared. He quickly flipped it and the room was instantly bathed in light, revealing his reflection. Nate&#39;s heart skipped a beat as he saw on the top of his head were bits of soft, white fur growing in with his usual dark blonde hair. Nate cried out in shock as that was not all. He nose and lips were darkening as well as a light layer of white fuzz was growing in around his face.  <br />
<br />
He looked at his hands and arms and saw the same white fur starting to grown in on his arms, hands and fingers as his palms were darkening and becoming rough. He tried to calm his anxiety by telling himself it was only for one day. 24 hours and then he&#39;d be a human man again. Nate couldn&#39;t help but grin from the excitement as he rubbed his fingers over the soft fur growing in. He looked up at the reflection in the mirror again and saw his face was now completely covered in white fuzz, obstructing his normally peach skin complexion. He smiled again and noticed his teeth were slowly growing into canine fangs. His normal dark blond hair was also almost completely replaced by shaggy white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look like a really cute werewolf,&quot; he remarked, surprised his voice was a couple octaves lower. His ears began to itch and he turned his head, watching as each ear began to grow out and flop over.  <br />
<br />
He walked out of the bathroom and looked over his arms and forearms at white fuzz on his forearms, hands and fingers. He walked back to his bedroom and pulled off his t-shirt, revealing a torso covered in the same short, white fuzz. He undid the belt on his jeans and slid those off as well, revealing to his surprise from the waist down, dark charcoal grey fur was growing in, matching the image he saw online perfectly. He crawled onto the bed, lying down on the comforter as he ran his fingers through his rapidly growing fur. His hand grasped the pendant and he picked it up in his hands, looking over the strange, magical item. Roughly ten minutes ago, he had been a normal man and now he was covered head to toe in soft fur and well on his way to turning into a dog. He hadn&#39;t been one to believe in magic, but he did now. He continued to run his fingers through the fur, feeling it getting longer and shaggier by the second.  <br />
<br />
He suddenly felt a strong cramping feeling in his feet and watched as they slowly stretched and reformed into canine paws. He cried out from the discomfort as his legs began to reform, becoming less human and more hind legs. He thought to himself that they must be entering the home stretch here. Soon, he&#39;d be all dog. His nose began to itch and tingle. He reached up and found it cold to the touch. It also felt different. Even though he couldn&#39;t see it, he knew it had changed. He watched in awe as his hands slowly reformed into forepaws and his nails grew out into claws. He felt the same cramping feeling as his torso began to reform into a more canine position. <br />
<br />
Nate slid off the bed, landing easily onto his four paws. It felt weird and yet natural all at once. He walked over and pushed open the door to his walk-in closet. He got up onto his hind legs and pushed the light switch to on with his forepaw. He knew the final change was coming and wanted to see it happen with his own eyes. He took in his reflection, shocked that the big, hulking dog beast reflected was him. He certainly would set the record for biggest Old English Sheepdog ever. He cried out as the same cramping feeling returned, this time around his face as it slowly pushed out into a canine snout. With that, the transformation from man to dog was complete. He took in his reflection, not quite believing it was him but ecstatic nonetheless. <br />
<br />
His stomach started to rumble. He was decidedly hungry but had not planned for this. Nate wondered, Should I be eating dog food? Is people food okay? Well, I&#39;m normally people, so it should be okay. I should avoid chocolate, just in case. He walked out of the bedroom and made his way down the hall to the kitchen. His newly heightened sense of smell only exacerbated his hunger pains. He just needed to figure out what he could get at as a dog, since he was without the use of hands. If he&#39;d thought this would work, he would&#39;ve planned it better.</p>
