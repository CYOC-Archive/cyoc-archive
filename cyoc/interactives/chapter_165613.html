<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Drew and the rest of the family takes a trip to the family-owned hot spring.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drew would like to bathe with his boyfriend. It is sexy if you think about it. Just them naked in the shower cleaning each other’s bodies. Drew would like to do it if he wasn’t so tired from all the unexplainable shit he got himself into. He can’t even answer his boyfriend whose new face is peeking outside the bathroom door waiting for a response. When Arthur saw his boyfriend already in the falling asleep, he walked naked towards him and tucked him in a blanket. His body is so big that the blanket didn’t cover his entire skin. And he is not even in the bed. Nevertheless, he could just ask his Uncle Alf to bring them more blankets tomorrow.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The following morning, Drew was supposed to take a bath early in the morning when Arthur, who is midway through the pancake breakfast he snatched in the kitchen, advised him not to. They’re going to the Onsen - a hot spring high above the mountains. It’s a long trek so Arthur further advised Drew to grab breakfast downstairs before his cousins eat all of them.<br />
<br />
When Drew came downstairs, he met Dylan who looked like he did not sleep well last night. He had a plate in hand containing a loaded quinoa bowl with banana, nuts, and blueberries. Drew would very much like to eat the pancakes served in the table with the maple syrup Arthur’s family is famous for. Dylan insisted on the Quinoa. His body is a temple that’s easy to get fat so eat quinoa or eat nothing.<br />
<br />
Drew grumbled. He thought being in a football player’s body would be a breeze but keeping appearances is taking all the fun. So he nabbed the quinoa and went back to his room to eat with his boyfriend. The Quinoa ain’t that bad - just a little bit dry on the side. It could really use a squeeze of maple syrup and luckily, Arthur brought a bottle back with him.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
When Arthur said that trek would take most of their morning, he meant it would take most of the morning. Arthur pointed at the peaking wooden towers beyond the pines and mist - that would be where the Onsen is. Their ancestors struck gold when they settled on this mountain. Not only did they have a farm for maple trees, but a hot spring that’s open to the public during summer and now, a ski course that’s going to be built next summer. The path is long and rocky. They could take the lift but their uncle Alfur insisted on the scenic route. <br />
<br />
So while they were trudging on the earthen path, their Uncle Alf recounted the history of their family, for the young ones, and those new additions to the family.<br />
<br />
The Williams family could trace their ancestry to the Hashimoto Clan in Japan. They were a secretive clan that also doubled as a cult who worshipped the heavens. On one fateful midnight, the night sky broke into a flash of light. A piece of heaven exploded and landed within the Hashimoto grounds. It was a meteor but no ordinary one. The Hashimoto’s found that the stone could alter reality, namely, the appearance of another person by wearing someone else’s apparel. You see, the Hashimoto believed that people leave a fragment of their soul in the things they own. The more you use a thing, the more soul left in that object. So, what thing is used more than your very clothes?<br />
<br />
The clan kept the stone a secret for centuries. Within that time, the stone melded with the tradition of the Hashimoto’s and soon, their very way of life revolved around it. One such tradition is a progenitor of Williams’s annual tradition. In this tradition, a father and a son, or a mother and a daughter, swaps for a year when the child reaches the age of 13 - the age of maturity for the Hashimoto. The child learns what it is to be an adult and the parent gets to have a year of relaxation in their child’s body. If it is a son, he learns how to do his father’s job or how to lead the family. In the case of a daughter, they learn how to give birth since house chores are left to the handmaidens. <br />
<br />
The Hashimotos kept themselves isolated until in the 1630s when Japan opened itself to foreigners. Seeing that the world is bigger than what they have known, the Hashimoto sought to expand their experience and clan throughout the world, while keeping the anonymity of the stones. As of now, the Hashimoto has expanded into multiple families throughout the world. The Williams family originally came from Europe but they migrated to the USA after the civil war. Then there’s the Jansen family in the Netherlands, who kept a modified tradition from the Hashimotos. Instead of swapping for a year, the parent and child swap for five years from age 13 to age 18.<br />
<br />
Arthur mentioned his classmate Lucas from his middle school. His family was originally from the Netherlands and Arthur’s parents mentioned that he’s a Jansen. They feel in their bones, or something like that. Arthur is pretty much close to everyone around him, except for Lucas Jansen. The kid never laughs when Arthur cracks a joke. Arthur and his friends horror-pranked him during Halloween but they were more scared when they realized that Lucas did not budge to any of their scares. He left grade 7 with a stoic demeanor but when he returned, he was a complete opposite of who he was before. He laughs a lot, even before Arthur cracks his jokes. Lucas would crack some himself, but his jokes sounded so old.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the school year, Arthur confessed that he knows who Lucas is. It wasn’t a bad thing. It is nice seeing a distant relative from another country. They talked about their families, how they are similar, and how they are different. One thing led to another and they were boyfriends just before Christmas. Arthur was supposed to invite him to the lodge when the real Lucas found out what his father was doing to his body. The real Lucas is the head of the family for five years and his words are final. They went back to the Netherlands and the dad posing as Lucas, never bothered to contact him again. Sometimes, Arthur wonders what happened to them? Of course, the real Lucas would be back to his original body by now.<br />
<br />
They reached the Onsen by the time Drew finished his story. The one he saw at the foot of the mountain paled in comparison to this. By his estimate, the place is three to five stories tall and completely made of wood. Just before entering the Onsen, they must pass a red bridge adorned with several T&#333;r&#333; (Japanese Lantern) at the sides. Drew peered below the bridge and saw a ravine with no discernable end.<br />
<br />
“Careful babe,” Arthur said before peering down himself. “Aunt Frida told me a family member fell here once. You can still hear his screams if you sleep in the Onsen at night.”<br />
<br />
Drew scoffed. He is not scared over old wives’ tales. He’s too old for such things and besides, he knows this is another one of Arthur’s crap jokes.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Only a few of the family joined in on the trip to the Onsen. When the children heard that they’d take the scenic route, most of them bailed out. Especially the teenagers stuck in children’s bodies, Dylan included. It is nice to be far away from him, even for a little bit. Dylan’s nagging is getting to Drew’s nerves. A trip to the hot springs can relieve some of the pressure building up in Drew’s body, and maybe even release the awkwardness in his body. <br />
<br />
The inside of the Onsen is more ornate than the ones outside. Wooden statues line the lobby, peering down on newcomers with grotesque Yokai sculptures. Arthur said the Onsen is a Roten-Buro, an outdoor hot spring. Before going to the hot spring, one must take a rinse themselves first in the indoor bath - to keep the hot spring clean and as a form of etiquette. The indoor bath also serves as the entrance to the three sections of the hot spring divided by gender which are male, female, and unisex. Those who found themselves in the body of the opposite gender went to the Unisex bath, while some went to the gender of their bodies. You know which ones are those whose sex changed because they are the ones that giggled the most. Aunt Frida who is currently in Rose’s Boyfriend’s Body, Oscar, is amazed at his current body that she had no qualms flaunting it with the other men. She’s waving her hips, joyful that her hips don’t hurt anymore and also, to flick that massive girth of dick between his legs.<br />
<br />
“Having a penis takes me back,” Aunt Frida said. She touched the shaft of his cock and playfully pumped it in front of the other undressing men.<br />
<br />
Seeing all these men surrounding him made Drew a tad bit uncomfortable. He was never around this much-naked people before. The first time he has seen another person naked is during his first sex with Arthur and there’s no one beyond that. Some of the men are peeking at Drew, waiting for him to undress. And just as he was undressing, he realized that he forgot to change to other underwear. He still has the jockstrap on, and fuck, seeing all these men is making him hard.<br />
<br />
“Babe,” Arthur said whilst undressing his underwear. “It’s okay. You don’t have to feel embarrassed around my uncles and cousins.”<br />
<br />
“But what if they judge me?”<br />
<br />
“They won’t judge you because they will be too busy judging Dylan, not you. And besides, I peeked in the Unisex room and Uncle Clyde showing off your body to the ladies. And man, the ladies are liking your abs.”<br />
<br />
Drew could not believe it one bit, but he did. His yoga sessions have finally paid off. Hearing that people liked his body, made Drew a lot more confident right now that he forgot what he was worried about before. He undressed his clothes and placed them in the shared locker with his boyfriend. He could see the other men of the family looking at him, but more specifically, the 6-inch flaccid uncut dick between his legs. His dick is smooth with little dismissable vein growth underneath. His groin is free of hair so smooth that Drew thought that he removed it via laser. Then there are his balls, smooth like the rest, bulbous pinkish and warm to the touch.<br />
<br />
“My, my…” A voice came from behind, whom Drew didn’t recognize. He turned around to see a man in his early 20s, blue hair with pale white pinkish skin. He doesn’t have an ounce of definitive muscle in him but he isn’t lanky either. He’s covered with a patch of freckles in his chest and three-flat moles in the sides. Drew looked down and saw an average length penis. Other than the bright colored hair, he’s pretty much an ordinary dude.<br />
<br />
“Ummm… Who are you?” Drew asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s me, Grey,” It’s Grey Williams, Arthur’s father. “I should have met with you boys after I swapped with my nephew’s body but I couldn’t find either of you and I thought you returned to your rooms. And I don’t want to intrude in case you’re fucking each other.”<br />
<br />
“Dad!” Arthur retorted.<br />
<br />
“What? Everyone’s thinking about it. You’re in Kyle’s body and your boyfriend is in Dylan’s. It is a perfect match and I know you know it. Unless you didn’t actually do it?” <br />
<br />
“Dad, we didn’t. Last night was Drew’s first swap and it must have been exhausting for him. And I was tired as well so we just slept.”<br />
<br />
“Well, there goes my hundred bucks.”<br />
<br />
“You bet for us to fuck each other?”<br />
<br />
“You know that betting is our tradition as much as transforming into each other’s bodies.”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know…”<br />
<br />
Before leaving, Mr. Williams left one final say in the matter, “Well, if you want Christmas gifts, go ask your Uncle Alf since he is the only one that bet against you two fucking each other last night.” He went by his stall and rinsed his body. Drew could see him mistaking his mole for dirt but it no matter how he scrubbed it, it won’t come off.<br />
<br />
While in their stalls, Drew saw some of the men stealing glances from him. Instead of feeling embarrassed about it, he feels empowered by it somehow. People are liking what he looks like so he appeased their wants by smiling at them. He even flexed his biceps once and Arthur joined in on the second time. <br />
<br />
While Arthur was scrubbing Drew’s back, he could not help but recount his thoughts about the bet. If Uncle Alf is the only one who voted against, that meant that Dylan’s dad even bet that his son’s body would be used to fuck his cousin. That’s sick in a kind of way if you forget the fact that it’s another person riding his son’s body. Well, the more Arthur thought about it, it’s not really incest anymore since Dylan and Kyle are as distant as the USA and China. Their surnames aren’t even the same anymore, and it goes the same for three-fourths of the family. It’s Arthur’s lineage that remains the main Williams Line. If his Uncle Alf fails to find a wife, soon the family figurehead might befall on Arthur. Being the figurehead means you’ll handle most of the family business, interaction with the other Hashimoto families, and you even get to hold a miniature transformation stone that you can use anytime you want. Arthur wants to become the figurehead just to get hold of the stone but the responsibilities of being one are making it not worth it. Arthur snapped out of the thought when Drew motioned that he finished scrubbing him. He was too deep in thought that he didn’t realize that Drew scrubbed between his dick. No wonder his dick is a beginning to get hard.<br />
<br />
Now that they have finished rinsing themselves, Arthur asked where they’ll go next. The Onsen offers a variety of services more than the hot springs.</p>
