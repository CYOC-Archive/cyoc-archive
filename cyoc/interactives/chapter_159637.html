<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon swam around in the sea, absolutely loving the sensation of the water flowing around his fishy body.<br />
<br />
Despite his enjoyment, there was someone who was on the back of his mind since his transformation. His girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monica.&quot; Damon thought, &quot;I have to find her and tell her about this.&quot; He said as he looked at his tail. He admired his new lower body, but knew this would throw a wrench in his relationship with Monica.<br />
<br />
Whether or not the fish tail would ruin his relationship was something Damon had to find out for himself as he flicked his fins upwards to the surface.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Monica was an attractive woman. Her body only being carefully covered up by her ruby red two-piece bikini as she relaxed on a towel and soaked up the sun.<br />
<br />
As much as she enjoyed the sun&#39;s warmth, she had something eating away at her recently. Her relationship with Damon.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that he was a bad boyfriend. Oh no. His kisses, restaurant dates, trips to the beaches, and his hugs prove otherwise. It was that things felt a bit… stagnant.<br />
<br />
For over three years, Monica and Damon had been together as boyfriend and girlfriend. Yet, that was the problem, they were still at the &quot;boyfriend and girlfriend&quot; stage, even though they both knew full well that they wanted to be with each other for the rest of their lives.<br />
<br />
Deep down, Monica wished they would become more than that. She wanted to be a wife, a mom. Monica sighed. On one hand, she wanted Damin to tie the knot already but on the other she didn&#39;t want to put unneeded pressure on her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Damon was here right now.&quot; She whispered.<br />
<br />
As if on cue, Monica heard a splash and cold droplets of water hit her hot body, prompting the girl to rise from her towel and her eyes widened at what she saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damon!&quot; Monica cried out as she ran to the water and showered her boyfriend with kisses all over his chest and cheek.<br />
<br />
Damon couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at this. &quot;Nice to see you, too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Monica barely listened as she kissed Damon&#39;s cheek and her mouth went up to his ear. Expecting to feel flesh, Monica&#39;s mouth felt something scaly and… finny?<br />
<br />
Monica quickly recoiled as she took a close look at what her mouth had touched. In place of his ears, Damon had pointed blue fins instead.<br />
<br />
Her eyes looked down to see gills pulsing at the sides of his torso.<br />
<br />
Monica began to swim back a bit, her eyebrows furrowed. &quot;Damon…&quot; She looked at her boyfriend in the eyes. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon gulped and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see…&quot; He swam back and showed his full merman body to Monica. &quot;I&#39;m not longer a human. I&#39;m a merman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica&#39;s hand reached out and carefully stroked his scales in fascination, completely entranced in wonder. Monica thought the royal blue color was beautiful and she was impressed to feel strong muscles in his scaly limb. <br />
<br />
Damon tried his hardest not to moan, as his fish scales were a lot more sensitive than human skin, especially with the gentle touch of his lover. He at least smiled as she saw the look on his girlfriend&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
It hit her. The tail was all too real to her. Her boyfriend was a real merman. A living legend of the sea, right in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing…&quot; Monica said in awe as she eventually brought her hand back. &quot;How did this even happen?&quot; She questioned. <br />
<br />
Damon coughed and his eyes darted around, &quot;Yeah, about that. We&#39;ll, how do I say this? Ummm… Let&#39;s just say that I signed a contract with a sea witch and leave it at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica nodded. She had a lot to process already, it was best to not try to overload her brain with knowledge of sea witches and contracts right now. Besides, she had something more important in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damon… We need to talk.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
Damon winced but sighed as well. &quot;Yeah. It&#39;s the tail, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No…&quot; Monica reassured him. &quot;I mean… A little bit but I&#39;m talking more about our status as boyfriend and girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon frowned a bit. &quot;You want to break up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! It&#39;s... ugh! It&#39;s not easy saying this but… I want to to get married!&quot; Monica finally blurted out. <br />
<br />
Damon&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Married? But look at me, I&#39;m a fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damon, I don&#39;t care if you have fins or feet.&quot; Monica swam up to Damon and gave him a hug. &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon smiled. He returned the hug and kissed Monica&#39;s cheek. &quot;I love you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them continued to embrace for what seemed like forever. Neither wanted to part away from the other. <br />
<br />
Eventually, letting go of their embrace, Monica spoke up. &quot;So you&#39;re all in on the marriage?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon grinned. &quot;Of course I am. I just need to swim underwater, get a fancy ring and...&quot; Damon&#39;s voice trailed off as the realization began to settle in. He looked at his fish tail and then back at Monica&#39;s legs. &quot;Oh no…&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. That&#39;s going to be the main problem.&quot; Monica sighed. &quot;How would a marriage between a human woman and a merman even work?&quot; She wondered if there was a way to be a mermaid.<br />
<br />
The two were silent for several minutes. Neither of them wanting to risk sinking their relationship at this point. They loved each other too much to seperate, yet mother nature said otherwise.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Damon spoke up. &quot;Maybe we could have a small marriage. We could get a home near a private beach and live there. On our wedding day, it would be the two of us exchanging vows and kissing in the sunset.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica scratched her chin and a grin began to appear. &quot;Yeah. That sounds pretty cute. I like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! We could make an income, too!&quot; Damon said. &quot;I can dive down in the water and hunt for treasure and we could sell what I can find. The sea is filled with treasure, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica began to grin more. &quot;I could work part time as a teacher and get supplemental stuff too. Oh, Damon, this sounds perfect! We could have enough money for a pool, a TV, a baby and… Oh…&quot; Monica paused.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah…&quot; Damon said as he scratched the back of his head and blushed. He was completely embarrassed. All this determination for a marriage and he didn&#39;t even know if he still had a manhood.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to give up on the relationship at this point. Monica looked down at his tail and her hand began to touch at where his groin would be if he was a human.<br />
<br />
&quot;There has to be something there. I just know it.&quot; Monica said.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Within the distance, Alora watched intently as she eyed her recent covert. <br />
<br />
A smile began to form on the sea witch&#39;s face. She was a sucker for love stories. In fact she has more than a few romance novels placed on her bookshelf, near her books of spells. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fascinating. A human woman with a merman? Now that&#39;s something you don&#39;t see every day.&quot; She said as she picked up Damon&#39;s contract and looked at it.<br />
<br />
Three days as a merman and Damon would be a polyp. That&#39;s what the condition of the contract says, and Damon happily signed it.<br />
<br />
Alora sighed at her dilemma. On one hand, she wanted Damon to pay the price to be a merman. On the other hand, three days was just not enough for Damon and Monica&#39;s love story to lead something more interesting. <br />
<br />
Using a tentacle as an extra hand, Alora scratched her chin at what to do next.</p>
