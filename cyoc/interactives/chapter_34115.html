<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The New Mark<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Mark was 50 pounds heavier.&quot; he muttered, a smile playing on his lips. &quot;And… was 8 inches taller.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behind him, his foster father cried out in shock! &quot;What? Hey! Ty, what...what's happened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty walked down the steps, and laughed at the sight. Mark was now 6'2&quot; tall, and the added poundage made him stagger. Ty sees that, under Mark's skin, all the subcutaneous fat was being transformed into muscle.  Mark's athletic build was getting more muscular as his clothes were being torn to shreds by his sudden growth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? What's up Mark? What do you need?&quot; Ty says with a smile. He watches as uncaring his foster father reaches out and steadies himself against the sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty...I don't know...what...How this could have happened. I'm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naked, for one thing.&quot; Ty says with a chuckle. &quot;Let's get you some...appropriate clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty makes another wish, and suddenly his foster fathers hulking form is wrapped in white cloth that quickly takes on a recognizable form. A skintight white shirt with a black bow tie at the neck covers his torso. The bottom of his foster father's form was covered in black leather pants. The pants were so tight that they left nothing to the imagination of what was underneath. <br />
<br />
Ty laughed as Marks face twisted in pleasure &quot;YOU! You're doing this to me! How...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, Mark. Wait until I'm done. Then you can thank me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark started towards Ty, but he was not use to his new size. Ty made more wishes. Marks gray hair kept its same length but turned back to its original brown color. Soon his hair began lighten to a honey blonde with sun bleached highlights.  The wrinkled face were replaced with smooth skin and a trimmed set of eye brows atop a pair of deep set blue eyes that anyone would get lost in. A light 5-o-clock shadow beard framed the masculine face.<br />
<br />
All the muscles in Marks grew in size again. The white shirt stretched thinner as Mark's body increased in size. Ty could hear the leather creak as Mark's leg muscles grew larger. Ty made sure that whatever Mark wore would be skin-tight and would never tear. Now Mark looks, to the entire world, like a man that spent hours in the gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Mark...&quot; Ty said, with a hint of amusement in his voice. &quot;...What are you doing lazing around the living room? Shouldn't you be in the kitchen making dinner? Mistress June will be home in a few hours, and you don't want her to be cross with you. After all, she might just fire you. Then you'd have to go back to the health club where she found you. You wouldn't want that, now would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Master Tyler. Please don't tell...”<br />
<br />
Mark suddenly felt his flesh tingle. He saw his skin darken to a shade of golden brown as most of the visible body hair was pulled back into the skin. His nose got a little smaller.  Unconsciously, his lips formed a natural smile. His hair turned a lighter brown, and though he knew he was a wealthy, businessman who owned this house and was married to &quot;Mistress June&quot;, he also knew that he was a live-in houseboy and was hired by this family as a companion.<br />
<br />
His body shifted inside the uniform, as huge pecs formed. His cock elongated out from his body and his balls became bigger completing the set of VERY male genitalia. His waist narrowed as a set of eight-pac abs formed making his hips seem to broaden while his butt swelled to twin striated globes. When it was done, Mark had gained another 25 pounds!<br />
<br />
Mark tried to curse at Ty, but what came from his mouth was an erotic lisp &quot;Oh Ty, what have you done to me. What are you going to tell my wife when he, I mean she gets home and his ... DAMN IT ... I mean HER Mark isn't here? What you going to say, Ty? An what about my lovely... gorgeous ... handsome son Dustin?&quot; All the time Mark was saying this he had his hands around his package rubbing it sensually.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled and reached out, cupping his former foster fathers buttocks and guiding him towards the kitchen. He'd wished that the newly minted Mark couldn't tell anyone who he really was, and that he couldn't refuse any request of Ty's. As opposed to ordering him around, Mark would be taking orders. Instead of being wealthy and impressive, he would be a live-in companion/house boy and unintimidating. Even at 6'2&quot; and 275 of muscle pounds, he looked helplessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, get into the kitchen, Mark And remember, once you enter the kitchen, you'll feel VERY comfortable and very much at ease. You'll feel quite natural, and you'll be happy. You'll remember who you really are, but you'll be unable to tell anyone unless I give you permission. But you won't worry about it, as you're just soooo happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Ty was right. Mark was suddenly happy and contented as he walked about, getting supper ready. He tried to put on an apron, but his arms were too big to reach behind him and tie the strings. Ty stepped in, tied it for him and gave him a kiss on the neck. Mark suddenly felt that he loved Ty as if he was his son. A lustful thought for his beautiful son came over him, and he smiled back at the saintly, friendly Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Ty.&quot; he lisped happily as he stepped back &quot;... What you’ve done to me is wrong, but I forgive you. I feel just so good inside. You always being such a nice boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark gave Ty an open mouth kiss that lasted more than a few seconds – (giggled) - then turned back to his work.<br />
<br />
Ty left the room, pleased yet stunned by the scope of his powers. He'd just re-made himself into a tall, handsome teenager... and replaced his unpleasant foster father with a muscular man who thought the world of him. He listened to Mark as he sang and cooked, sounding like any happy man in his kitchen. <br />
<br />
He looked up at the clock, and saw that June should be home in an hour, and who knew where Dustin had run off to. He had to decide what to do with them. He thought he might keep Mark as he was (houseboy Mark was quite an improvement), but wasn't sure. <br />
<br />
He had to think.</p>
