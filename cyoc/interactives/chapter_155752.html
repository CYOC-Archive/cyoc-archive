<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a massive breakfast (she demolished the entire box of waffles), Sophie began assembling her kit. Tent, bedroll, cooking supplies, all the essentials for a long hike. She would leave the trail occasionally for more food and water, there were many places along her route that catered to hikers. <br />
<br />
She hesitated with the last two items. First was her choice of footwear, her beloved stomper boots. Heavy black leather, steel toe, thick sole, oversize buckles, mid calf length - she had worn variations on this same theme for years. She knew these were not a good choice for hiking but couldn&#39;t say no. Second was a snub nose .357 revolver and a pocket holster. After an unfortunate incident with a short shithead with a Napoleon complex and a switchblade, Sophie had gotten the pistol and obtained her carry permit. In a way this was an easier choice, as the trail could have four legged predators as well as the two legged kind.<br />
<br />
Ready, she loaded up her kit into her lead sled, a lowered 1944 DeSoto. No matter which path she chose, she told herself, she isn&#39;t giving up her beloved street rod.<br />
<br />
Miles rolled past as she drove out into the countryside. <br />
<br />
As she drove, the strange twinges from this morning returned. It built to the point that she felt like her insides were crawling and everything below her sternum was periodically twitching under her skin. This was alarming but she put it down to spending the night on the bathroom floor and nerves.<br />
<br />
If she had looked closely in the mirror, she might have noticed that the twisting growth up her back had reached her shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
After a few hours she reached a dirt parking area used by hikers. Soon after she was off.<br />
<br />
The sun dropped in the sky as she pushed to reach the camp site she had planned for her first night. A persistent itch at the base of her skull increased into a piàñnching sensation, then faded.<br />
<br />
She felt relaxed, but more so she was horny. She couldn&#39;t explain her arousal, but she could feel that she was wet and ready down below.<br />
<br />
As the sun set, she took the side trail to the camp site. Ahead she saw a fire already burning and a two person tent.<br />
<br />
As she entered the clearing, she saw a young man only a few years older than her. Dark buzz cut hair and a few days stubble, she noticed a USMC tattoo on his sizable bicep. He stood as he noticed her approach. Tall, fit, and ruggedly handsome; the fires of Sophie&#39;s arousal burned even hotter. <br />
<br />
&#39;Hi! Mind if I camp here too? I just hit the trail today.&#39;<br />
<br />
She was close enough to the fire now that the guy could see her clearly. His eyes wandered a bit, taking in her long shapely legs which were nicely displayed by her tight jeans.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sure! I&#39;m Daniel. Hey Sam, we&#39;ve got company.&#39;<br />
<br />
From the tent came another large figure. She did a double take, as the newcomer was identical to Daniel, right down to the Marine corps tattoo.<br />
<br />
Sam noticed her surprise and laughed. &#39;Twin brothers, I guess it shows.&#39;<br />
<br />
They shook hands, and together cleared some brush to make room for her tent. As she settled in, they shared their stories.<br />
<br />
The brothers were fresh out of the Marines, having enlisted together upon graduation from high school. They had decided to hike the entire trail as a way to transition themselves away from the controlled orderly life of the military.<br />
<br />
She shared her story as well, including her crossroads. She even explained the sexual component of her dilemma. Normally she wouldn&#39;t be that forward, but it seemed to spill out without conscious effort on her part.<br />
<br />
She found herself moving, sitting down between the two brothers. Both were slouching a bit, trying to hide erections. She put her arms across each of their shoulders.<br />
<br />
&#39;Perhaps a threesome with two big buff Marines might help me decide.&#39;<br />
<br />
Both tensed in surprise, but Sophie was already working to undo Sam&#39;s belt. While she had enjoyed the attention she had drawn over the past year, she had never done anything this forward. She almost felt like she was a spectator as her mouth and body acted on their own. <br />
<br />
Quickly cloths went in a heap. She mounted Sam with no resistance, his seven inches sliding right in to her wet and ready slit.<br />
<br />
She pushed Sam backwards off the log upon which he had been sitting. On top, she looked back at Daniel and slapped her ass. He took the hint. Somehow he slipped right inside as well, her anus felt lubricated and prepped though she had done nothing.<br />
<br />
There was no technique, just raw fast fucking. Sophie felt the same strange twitches and movement from earlier, this time focused around the cocks inside her. Both brothers quickly erupted. She felt their cum pulsing out into her cunt and ass in impossible amounts. Pressure built. Still they came.<br />
<br />
She reach orgasm as well, building into rolling waves of ecstasy. A small sliver of her mind wondered how the three of them could climax this long, but the pleasure was too great.<br />
<br />
The face in front of her seemed different. Sam&#39;s hair was a few inches long, and his stubble was gone. His face looked softer.<br />
<br />
The world faded away as Sophie felt pressure and stretching from her stomach.</p>
