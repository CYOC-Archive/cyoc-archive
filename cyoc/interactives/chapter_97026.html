<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night finished hard for William. He was honestly sorry that things had gone so bad and he truly didn&#39;t want Yvette&#39;s attention, and after Martha left for her bedroom with the Twists, which amounted only to conversation as his ears didn&#39;t hear anything remotely close to sex, he spent hours seated and battling with conflicting emotions. Martha was still beautiful and he found his penis rising again through the night for her, and he also privately admitted that Samantha and Frances were also beautiful, and to make matters worse, at times, thoughts of Yvette sneaked back into his mind and that frustrated him. It served as a reminder on his past and how often he&#39;d thought with his penis because Martha was busy or tired from her duties as a mother and all the problems it had caused him in the past. It left him with very little sleep.<br />
<br />
His day started with Martha coming down to untie him with Samantha and Frances back in their human forms. He was only surprised to find himself in human form again, though it didn&#39;t amount much more support from Samantha or Frances. Frances remained quiet and tough to read, and while Samantha wasn&#39;t as hostile to him, she wasn&#39;t exactly friendly toward him. The only reason for the lack of hostility was probably Martha reporting that William was a bad liar and she didn&#39;t notice any of the twitches or signs that he was lying. It was a small favor, though it didn&#39;t count for much.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re giving you this chance because of Martha&#39;s decision,&quot; Samantha said to him before his sons came down for breakfast, &quot;you want to be on OUR good side? We&#39;ll let you complete your transformation with that vixen... but from there, you have to abide by whatever Martha demands of you and you&#39;ll need to prove you can be loyal to your mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I...?&quot; William began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need to complete your transformation,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;Otherwise... you&#39;ll never have full control and a part of you will want that vixen to complete it. It&#39;s why we will let you have one last dalliance. Once you have control... then you&#39;ll need to abide by the deal Martha&#39;s given you.&quot;<br />
<br />
William only sighed.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
He managed to arrive at college on time, but as he made his way into the lecture hall to get things ready, he found both the dean and Yvette waiting for them. And he found that it was their scents that alerted him to their presence first. The dean smelled like a cat, but MUCH bigger and much more powerful, which actually made him a bit fearful, and he recognized Yvette&#39;s personal scent for obvious reasons. When he entered, he found the dean holding Yvette by the arm and with a frown on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... she was right... she did manage to infect you,&quot; the dean said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William said looking down, &quot;She either clawed me in her attempt to rape me or when you pulled her off of me... and has only lead to more trouble for me at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; the dean answered, &quot;but that will be your concern... I really can&#39;t interfere there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; William answered with a nod and wishing that Yvette didn&#39;t have the triumphant smirk on her face that she did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I can make sure that Yvette here does give a full confession on HER actions to the police and the town chancellor,&quot; the dean spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s already aware...&quot; William told him and privately cursed himself when he felt his penis growing erect in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, it&#39;d be a formality, and will include the security tapes that prove you weren&#39;t the instigator of the incident,&quot; the dean told him, &quot;though the fact that she&#39;s infected you will make things more difficult...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He needs me,&quot; Yvette gave a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I wish I didn&#39;t,&quot; William gave a low grumble, &quot;I truly wish I didn&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It happens,&quot; the dean answered, &quot;though you will need to control yourself through the day... can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
William slowly nodded, &quot;I think so...&quot;<br />
<br />
The dean then nodded, and turned to Yvette, &quot;and you... your punishment will then have to wait... though you will be aware that it will be expulsion and that you will need to take a birth control pill BEFORE you complete William&#39;s transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
William heard a low growl ease into the dean&#39;s voice that carried a very serious threat. Yvette noticed it and did shrink away from the weretiger, even in his human form. She did nod, and with that, the dean let her go. With that, the dean patted William on the shoulder and then left, likely to finish his own tasks for the day. Yvette smiled to him and left for her her own first classes. As she reached the door she turned to him, &quot;I&#39;ll meet you at your car and we can go to a hotel to complete your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
William detected a slight tone of defeat in her voice, and figured that was understandable. He wouldn&#39;t want to risk a fight with a tiger either. Though there was a lot that would need to be done.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can stop at a pharmacy before the hotel,&quot; William said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t trust me?&quot; Yvette smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? You nearly killed my marriage... a marriage I&#39;ve honestly been trying to save despite my... my flaws... and it&#39;ll now be harder,&quot; William answered, his voice caught between arousal and frustration, which only made Yvette smirk more.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I&#39;m not queer,&quot; Yvette answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that matter?&quot; William actually snarled, feeling his teeth sharpen, &quot;I have loved Martha... even with all my mistakes... her being BISEXUAL doesn&#39;t matter. The sooner my transformation is complete... the sooner I can be rid of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your voice says no...&quot; Yvette laughed and then left.<br />
<br />
William only sighed and let her go. It would be a long day. And he could tell it wouldn&#39;t go easily, and while Yvette was attractive and the sex would surely be good, it wasn&#39;t sex that he wanted, even with the much larger erection that he presently had pressing against his underwear and pants.</p>
