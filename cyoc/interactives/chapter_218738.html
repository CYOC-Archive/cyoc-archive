<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first card reads, &quot;TG Questionnaire: If You Were a Guy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Huh, sounds kind of weird. You then look at each of the cards and find that the questions are all on the back of each one. Now to quit wasting any more time, you finally go and read the first question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 1: If you were a guy... would your handwriting be neat or messy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably messy,&quot; you wrote down.<br />
<br />
Not long after that, you feel your hands changing a bit. When you pick up the second card, you notice that your hands are bigger than before. Your nails have additionally shrunk down, and if you have nail polish on them, then it had naturally vanished. Still, you can&#39;t stop yet, so you move on to the next question by flipping the card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 2: If you were a guy... would you still like pink or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
You write down a no, and you instantly begin to feel a dislike toward any pink clothes on you, let alone shirts or pants or whatever. Once again, you pick up the next card and flip it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 3: If you were a guy... would your hair be straight or curly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe straight,&quot; you answered as you wrote.<br />
<br />
Once you get the next card on your hand, you find out that your hair, which has been touching your shoulders for nearly as long as you could remember, is now short and straight as a comb over. You yet again flip the card over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 4: If you were a guy... what would be your favorite color?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your previous color preference shifts to the masculine color. If your favorite color was blue, then it just stays the same. You take the fifth card and read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 5: If you were a guy... what would your hair color be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark brown.&quot;<br />
<br />
If your hair was originally blonde or red, it darkens down and changes into a nice form of brown. Same with the light brown hair, but minus the color change. If your hair was black, however, it lightens up a little as it reveals its colored form, but if your hair color was dark brown, then it pretty much stays the same. You pick up the next card just to answer another question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 6: If you were a guy... what would your eye color be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue again.&quot;<br />
<br />
If your eye color is that, then it also stays the same. If not, then you feel a poking sensation on your eyes. You open them and find out that your irises are now blue. You get another card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 7: If you were a guy... would you work out regularly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is definitely one of the most effective questions for your body because if number two and four affected your brain, then most of the other ones would change your own. Starting with your biceps, they gain a lot of muscle on them, resulting in incredibly masculine arms. Your shoulders widen to fit your much less slender arms. During that, both your boobs and nipples shrink down dramatically as the latter darkens. Ultimately, your breasts pull themselves back to your chest, but something is bound to replace them. Muscle spreads all around your chest and forms hard pectorals on it. If you had time to flex them, you would do that, but you instead get the next card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 8: If you were a guy... would you be sporty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously.&quot;<br />
<br />
While you answer the question, your skin generally roughens as it simultaneously tans. As your hips narrow down, your waist thickens, demolishing your hourglass figure. In place of that, a six-pack set of abs form on your stomach. Your behind receives more muscle, though it&#39;s more subtle compared to most of your body now. Because of this change, your butt loses most of its fat to welcome it, and this helps tone your legs. Despite all that&#39;s happened so far, your feet still remain small. You pick up yet another card and flip it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 9: If you were a guy... what kind of shoes would you currently wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pair of tennis shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
As expected, your feet become just as big and meaty as your hands, and they don&#39;t spare your toenails as they shrink down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 10: If you were a guy... would you wear a suit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but only on special occasions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 11: If you were a guy... would you be manly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br />
<br />
This kills the remnants of your girly mind; your mind is now suited to the young man you&#39;re going to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 12: If you were a guy... what would be your &#39;package&#39; size?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six inches long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right after you finish writing that, you get a painful feeling in your groin as your reproductive system rearranges itself. While nobody is looking, you spread your legs apart to get ready for your new organs. First off, your ovaries: they alter around and descend as all of your egg cells turn into sperm. They soon cause one of your testicles to develop from your labia during a second, and then create the other one during another. As soon as your pussy closes up, your clitoris bulges outside of it. At first glance, it appears be only an inch long, but while your fallopian tubes and uterus vaporize, it grows another inch and then another before it suddenly doubles in length. To add to that, your cervix seals shut just like your vagina, while your prostate gland forms when your bladder relocates. Foreskin covers up your new cock, with the exception of your urethral opening. Once your womb is no more, your penis&#39;s head finally reveals itself at the end, securing your new gender. You happen to be quite surprised at this, but that won&#39;t stop you from answering the rest of the questions. Somewhat nervous, you pick up the next card to get another one answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 13: If you were a guy... would you be straight, gay, or bisexual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your lust of seeing manly, muscled hunks naked disappears. In place of that is your desire to see beautiful, busty women completely nude. This is easily proved when you realize that the handsome jock isn&#39;t nearly as sexy as prior to the questionnaire. The big buxom cheerleader in your class inexorably takes his place as your darling crush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 14: If you were a guy... would you shave often?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like some facial hair on my face, but yes, I would do that just to keep it on a limit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your face contorts itself as it prepares to change. Before that, your neck thickens as an Adam&#39;s apple makes it its new home. You whisper quietly to yourself so that you won&#39;t get caught, and you realize that your voice is significantly deeper. Stubble begins form around your lips as they thin, and your eyebrows thicken. Both your eyes and eyelashes shrink down as the former gets into a more ovular shape. While that happens, your nose protrudes itself, and your jaw helps your face get harder by becoming straight and rough. Your forehead and chin also protrude to properly suit this. Lastly, your cheekbones slightly rise up, ending your face&#39;s masculinization. You look at your legs to find that they both have also gained hair. You move on to the next question by getting the next card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 15: If you were a guy... would you use cologne or hair gel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cologne.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just like with question ten, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 16: If you were a guy... what type of shirt would you currently wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A black tank top.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your sleeves recede back to your shirt while it darkens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 17: If you were a guy... would you wear briefs, boxers, or something in between those?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boxers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiding inside your skirt, which converts into a navy pair of shorts, your panties lengthen a little while turning blue, becoming a pair of boxers just for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 18: If you were a guy... rate how smart would you be: zero being a complete idiot and ten being smart enough to rival the class nerd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven, not too smart, but not too dumb either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet again, nothing changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 19: If you were a guy... how old would you be, and what would your height or weight without any shoes or clothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;16, would be 5&#39;11, and weigh 189 pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
The changes return to your body by simply affecting your spine. It extends your height until you are almost six feet tall. Your age doesn&#39;t change because you wrote your current one. Then again, it&#39;s nothing compared to other cases you have faced. Finally at the end, you pick up the final card and read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Question 20: If you were a guy... what would your name be?&quot;<br />
<br />
You write down your name as a guy, and now you are done. You realize that you are changed into a 16 your old man, and you made yourself into quite a stud. You look all around the room to give the questionnaire to someone else. When you try to find the girl who gave you the note, you unfortunately find that the same girl left for whatever reason. Just to wait for her to return, you pass the note over to one of your classmates.</p>
