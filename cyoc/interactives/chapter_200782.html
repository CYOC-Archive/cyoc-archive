<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While her students and staff were getting settled in to their new accommodations at the Villa de Vasconcellos, Lady Juliet was spending her time with their hostess. Countess Irena seemed to be in better spirits since Juliet has last saw her. Part of it had to have been from seeing her home full of people after so many years of emptiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, it&#39;s not as grand as your mansion, but there&#39;s room enough for now,&quot; said Irena, &quot;More living quarters will be built later, once they decided where the best place for them will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve been there,&quot; said Juliet, &quot;In fact, I&#39;m still currently there. I have to keep in regular contact with those contractors to make sure they don&#39;t plan to put anything over anyplace important. At least I can manage that over the phone or by video chat. I needed to get away from all that construction for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And put some distance between you and that golden fox who&#39;s been causing trouble?&quot; asked Irena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Juan is actually a gentleman,&quot; said Juliet, &quot;The problem is that everyone keeps assuming that we&#39;re both fox species, without even considering how separate our particular species are, that we&#39;ll both end up together, damn whatever the Animalian Edicts say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you&#39;re a celebrity, <i>everyone</i> wants to know about your love life,&quot; said Irena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, what about you and Lopez?&quot; asked Juliet, &quot;I can see he&#39;s also a Pyrenean Ibex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are some advantages and disadvantages,&quot; said Irena, &quot;One is that I&#39;ve already known him for many years and I can actually say that I&#39;m not letting my hormones do my matchmaking for me. But the disadvantage is that Lopez has had years of loyal servitude and propriety embedded to his core. Even as the same species, he&#39;s hesitant to do anything &#39;improper&#39; with me. I&#39;m hoping our wedding will change his mind better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing his conversion lacked the intimacy that others have,&quot; said Juliet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would be guessing correctly,&quot; said Irena, thinking back...<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Lopez had been rather shocked when the Countess returned from America as an Ibex Animalian, even though she had told him of her intent. Still, Lopez had been her loyal gardener for years and he wasn&#39;t about to leave even after all the changes that had happened to his lady or the changes that may be happening to his estate. But it was the changes that were offered to himself that unsettled him the most.<br />
<br />
&quot;My lady, this seems rather inappropriate,&quot; said Lopez.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would be appropriate?&quot; asked Irena, &quot;A few years ago, the family line would have ended with me. Who else would inherit the estate? Do you think the government would want to keep this land as it is? Would they have wanted to keep you there? This is a new beginning for the de Vasconcellos and if I want to keep the family going, I will need a husband, a mate. And I can&#39;t think of someone worthier than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I am only a humble gardener,&quot; said Lopez.<br />
<br />
&quot;One who&#39;s stayed with this family for many years, even with the family whittled down to just one. I know you haven&#39;t had a family of your own, but I&#39;m offering you the chance to start a new one. You should be rewarded for all your years of loyalty and hard work,&quot; said Irena.<br />
<br />
Lopez was hesitant and tried hard not to look at the Countess. Even if she was a goat, she had the body of a supermodel now. It just felt so wrong to be lusting after the Countess like that. &quot;I just...think you could do better...&quot; said Lopez humbly.<br />
<br />
Irena sighed. Sometimes loyalty could be a double-edged sword. &quot;Even if you&#39;re unsure about me, you do deserve a reward at least,&quot; she said. She put a glass of milk on the table, &quot;Youth, strength, and good health, right here for you. If nothing else, you should at least still be around to maintain the grounds as this new colony is built. I leave the choice to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the Countess left the room. As admirable as Lopez&#39;s devoutness is, it left her feeling a bit disappointed. She had heard many tales of Animalians converting their lovers in an intimate fashion which soon led into their first mating. Since her own conversion, Irena had felt her libido building up. She wasn&#39;t as straight-laced as some of the other ladies she knew of, but it was rather frustrating to have no one to help scratch her itch.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she heard the sound of hoofsteps. She hurried a bit eagerly to their source. Lopez was no longer an old Spanish man, but a young Pyrenean Ibex Animalian. Being built more for climbing and balance, he didn&#39;t become too muscular, though his clothes didn&#39;t hang on his frame as much as before. Quite noticeably, he had a far larger pair of horns than Irena, and she found herself being turned on more by that. &quot;You&#39;re looking much better, Lopez,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am feeling better,&quot; said Lopez, his voice so deep and rich now.<br />
<br />
Irena felt herself quivering with arousal. It took a lot of control to keep her from tearing off Lopez&#39;s clothes on the spot. &quot;Perhaps now you might-&quot; she started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment, my lady,&quot; said Lopez, &quot;I think I&#39;m still...processing this. This is a big change for me. And I don&#39;t wish to sully your honor like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Irena ground her teeth with frustration but kept her tongue. She wasn&#39;t about to offend Lopez by acting like a horny schoolgirl. She&#39;s waited this long, she can wait a little a longer. Anyways, now that he was an Animalian, she was sure Lopez will overcome his reserves eventually. &quot;Take as much time as you need, Lopez,&quot; said Irena, &quot;And please, call me Irena now.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Lopez was stand-offish at first, but he came around eventually,&quot; said Irena, rubbing her engagement band.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re quite fortunate to have someone like him,&quot; said Juliet, &quot;Such devotion is hard to find these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chivalry is overrated sometimes,&quot; said Irena flatly, &quot;It&#39;s rather lonely to be put on a pedestal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I see your point,&quot; said Juliet, &quot;Still, at least the de Vasconcellos will thrive again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if we have to become goats for that to happen,&quot; said Irena, &quot;I&#39;m just glad our old enemies are dust. Imagine what the Inquisition would have done to people like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought the Spanish Inquisition wasn&#39;t as harsh as people said it was,&quot; said Juliet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps not, but I think this may have been more than they could tolerate,&quot; said Irena, &quot;But enough dwelling in the past. It&#39;s time to start looking towards the future.&quot;</p>
