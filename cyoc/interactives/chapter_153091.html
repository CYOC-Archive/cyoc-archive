<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
“Are you kidding, leave this backwater of a place and become what I always wanted to become since I was six years old?” cried Jill like a little girl on Christmas morning, Vicki just smiled as her girlfriend jumped for joy.<br />
“And better yet, we will not have to hide what we are down there.” Answered Vicki as she took Jill’s hands and looked her into the eyes. “According to Damon or Scarlett depending on what you want to call him or her, mother we don’t have to hide being together.”<br />
“This day can’t get any better.” Cried Jill <br />
“Question how old are you?” inquired Carine “Both of you?”<br />
“16, almost 17.” Answered Jill<br />
“almost 18.” Answered Monica as Carine nodded. “Why?”<br />
“You have to understand, I can turn people under the age of 18 into mermaids and mermans. If you where older their would be a much harder process to turn you into merpeople.” Explained Carine “And you have to understand, while it is possible to turn someone into a merperson if they are older then 18, there is no to turn a merperson into a human after their 18th birthday.”<br />
“So there is basically no coming back, if you come with us.” Stated Vicki “You will have to leave your family.”<br />
That caused Jill to pause, she had a better life then any of the them, her parents were separated but neither of them where drunks or on drugs but they also never paid her much attention either and when she talked about gay upper classman coming out to see how they reacted they talked about how the classman’s parents should send the kid to a camp to straighten up and follow the right path. This had told her that she needed to keep her sexual orientation hidden. She still loved them, but she knew they would never accept her. <br />
“It will be hard, but to be with you it is a price I am willing to pay.” Confirmed Jill as Vicki gave her another kiss and a reassuring hug.<br />
“And you Monica?” inquired Vicki as suddenly Damon appeared on the edge of the beach. She pulled herself slightly onto the beach to get close to Monica. Monica looked down at what her boyfriend had become.<br />
“Listen, Monica, I am sorry about this, I didn’t know what she was doing to me until it was already done.” Explained Damon “I will not ask you to come with me, I will not ask you to become something you don’t want. I just want you to be happy, I want that more then anything. So…”<br />
Before he could say anything more, Monica jumped down onto her knees so she was at eye level with Scarlett and before Scarlett could say more, she pulled him/her into a kiss. Scarlett was taken aback as she returned the kiss even as the surf hit her in the back and splash up on Monica. They didn’t break the kiss as the wave washed over them. When they did Monica pulled back and looked him in the eyes. <br />
“How could I be happy without you?” inquired Monica. “I love you, be it as a man or a mermaid, be your name Damon or Scarlett, I love you.”<br />
“I love you.” Said Damon with a smiled. “So you will come?”<br />
“It is either that or go back to working two jobs so that my parents can pay for their own drug habits.” Stated Monica before she paused. “I do with to stay a women, are you alright with a mermaid?”<br />
“I may have a mermaid body, but I am still me.” Laughed Damon as he placed his new hand under her chin and pulled her into another kiss.<br />
“So, three mermaids?” inquired Princess Carine as she appeared closer to the shore.<br />
“Yes.” Said Monica as Jill and Vicki nodded their heads in agreement. <br />
“Alright, please come into the water and remove your clothing besides if you want a top. We will have to do this one at a time” ordered Carine as Jill raised her hand.<br />
“Hold on, I don’t want my parents to think I am dead.” Said Jill as she pulled out her phone and dialed a number. After a few rings, they could hear a voice on the other end. “Hello Mother, I have something to tell you.”<br />
Jill’s voice seamed strong but yet her face showed resolved fear and concern.<br />
“Mother, I am gay and I don’t care….”<br />
“WHAT!!!!” yelled her mother’s voice on the other end. “YOU CAN’T BE GAY I WILL NOT LET ME DAUGHTER BE A GODLESS SINFUL WHORE!”<br />
“I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU THINK!” Yelled Jill back into her phone before she calmed down a bit. “I love you and dad but I will not hide what I am, not anymore.”<br />
“WHEN YOU GET HOME YOU ARE GOING TO….” Started her mother still screaming in rage.<br />
“AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN, I AM LEAVING! GOODBYE!” yelled Jill <br />
“LIKE HELL YOU….” Started her mother as Jill hung up.<br />
“You ok?” inquired Vicki as she placed her hand around her girlfriend pulling her close.<br />
“Actually, strangely yes.” Confirmed Jill as her phone started ringing again, the caller ID said it was her mother. Instead of answering Jill threw the phone into the water. “Alright, I am ready.”<br />
“I am proud of you.” Confirmed Vicki kissing Jill again who smiled at finally coming out. <br />
“Whenever you are ready?” inquired Corine<br />
“Do me first.” Said Jill “My House is nearby, and my mother may come to find me.”<br />
“Alright.” said Carine<br />
“Damon, will you take my bike out to sea and dump it somewhere it will never be found?” inquired Jill as Damon nodded as Vicki picked up the bike while Damon dragged himself out into the water. She took the bike and went about 60 feet off the beach and dumping it into the sandy bottom. He swam back to find Jill, Vicki and Monica standing in about chest high water. His mother was in front of Jill who hugged Vicki one last time as a human before the same energy surrounded her. Jill felled backwards into the water just as Damon arrived. He watched as the transformations took over his sister’s girlfriend. <br />
It was strange watching it from the outside as Jill began to transform, gills came in first as expected and she took her first breath of sea water. Moments later, her dark hair seamed to get somehow darker and her eyes changed as well, becoming a purple color. Aside from her hair and eyes, nothing from the waist up seamed to change, well aside from her now webbed hands. All the changes where below the waist line as her legs merged together into a long tail which began to be covered with scales, dark purple with black sections as well. Finally the energy faded and Jill just lied their for a moment.<br />
“Wow…this feels so good.” Said Jill her voice clear as day under the water before she surfaced and looked at Vicki and Monica. <br />
“How was it?” inquired Vicki<br />
“Strange but so good.” Confirmed Jill as she smiled. “Can’t wait to see you as a mermaid.”<br />
“Neither can I? But first Monica.” Stated Vicki as Carine moved to his girlfriend and placed a glowing hand of energy on her chest. Within seconds her entire body became covered with the same light as she fell backwards.<br />
“It will be alright.” Reassured Damon as he took Monica’s hand as she began to transform. He floated beside her holding her hand eyes locked as she changed. Jill was nearby watching as well, as Monica’s blonde hair turned to a aqua blue color but her blue eyes didn’t change. The webbing in her fingers grew in even as Damon held her hand, he actually noticed that her finger nails changed colors to a bluish silver and that his was a red.<br />
Monica’s tail grew in a mix of silver, light blue and even white and just as before when it was done, the glow faded.<br />
“How do you feel?” inquired Damon as Monica responded by grabbing his face and pulling him/her into a kiss. <br />
“This is how I am feeling.” Answered Monica <br />
Lastly it was Vicki’s turn as she began her change, her golden blonde hair and green eyes stayed the same, her finger became webbed like the others and as her tail came in it was a golden yellow with some neon yellows and white mixed in. <br />
“You were right, this feels weird.” Said Vicki as she spoke underwater for the first time.<br />
“Ladies Welcome to the sea.” Said Princess Corine “Now follow me.”</p>
