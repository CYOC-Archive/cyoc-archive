<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Amelia heard steps in front of the door, she quickly picked up a blanket from the bed and held it in front of her naked body. Then an average-sized young man with shoulder-length dark hair enters. In Amelia's opinion, he was neither handsome nor ugly - but at the moment his looks weren't that important to her. As he saw her standing in the middle of the room with the blanket, he looked quite astonished. &quot;Greeting, mylady, I thought it would be better to get to know each other a little before our marriage. As I see, you seem to be appropriately dressed for that.&quot; Amelia blushed, but quickly found an appropriate answer. Lowering the blanket to just over her nipples, she smiled lasciviously at the prince. &quot;It seems you had a very good idea, dear sir. Come hither, and rid yourself of all those clothes, as I would like to get to know you as well.&quot; Now the prince just stood there for a moment, amazed by both the body and the behaviour of his bride. He was also a bit nervous, as although he had had some experiences with maids at his home castle, he had never needed to show off his entire body to them, and he hoped that Amelia would like what she would see. He started to unbutton his shirt and made a few steps forward while his erection was throbbing in his pants - easy to see for Amelia. The fact that her future husband obviously wanted her gave her self-confidence a boost, and she lowered the blanket further, exposing her entire upper body. The prince had thrown his shirt away and was coming closer, staring at her breasts. She dropped the blanket and embraced him. The prince pulled her towards himself. Her breasts touched his skin, and she immediately began a passionate kiss. While their mouths opened and their tongues met, he smacked her butt with one of his cold hands. She found it rather unpleasant, and the feeling continued as his hand came around her body and landed on her vulva. As he ran an icy cold finger along her slit, she pulled back from the kiss. &quot;Dear sir, I see you just arrived here. Would you mind not touching my delicate parts with your hands until they are warmer?&quot; Surprised, Calypso pulled his hand back. He didn't know what to make of her remark. The other women he had fornicated with had never commented on anything he did other than with moans of joy, so why did this one, who had waited for him naked like a harlot, suddenly object to being touched? On the other hand, she was going to be his wife and officially his only sexual partner for many years, so it would be better to try to satisfy her. He answered &quot;I'm very sorry, I was overwhelmed by your unworldly beauty.&quot; and renewed their kiss. Amelia quickly unbuttoned his pants and took the freed penis into her right hand. She began to move it carefully, wanting to keep him entertained without making him cum. With her left hand, she grabbed his right hand, which was a bit warmer now, and put it on her breast. He began to fondle her and gently squeezed her nipple, which she liked. Soon, he took her other breast into his other hand and was now playing with both. The young lovers were both greatly enjoying themselves now. Amelia was so wet she thought her juices would soon start to run down her legs. She wanted to be touched there, so se grabbed his right hand from her boob and carefully led it down between her legs. When Calypso felt the swollen, soft, wet flesh he knew he had never seen a woman so aroused before. This kind of sex, with the girl telling him what to do, was completely new for him, and to his great surprise he almost liked it better than the usual way. He gently carressed her, than slid one of his fingers into her opening. He could tell she was pleased as the was pressing her body closer against his and jerked him off faster.<br />
Amelia had never felt so good before, but as Calypso's finger was probing high up in her vagina, she remembered something important. She broke the kiss again, &quot;I love what you're doing, but please pay attention and don't take my virginity yet, we'd both be in trouble!&quot; The prince realized she was right and pulled his fingers back out. Meanwhile her hand had brought him to the point of ejaculation, and as he wanted to try out something else with her he took his hand from her vulva and grabbed hers with it. He pulled her towards the bed and she laid down on it, with him kneeling over her. He pushed her breasts together, looking into her eyes for signs of disapproval, and when he didn't find any he pushed his cock in between them. Andy was amazed, less by the act itself but by the fact that the breasts where big enough for it. However being tit fucked didn't give her much, so she began to toch herself again. This time, she noticed something she hadn't known before - she actually had a clitoris, and touching it was highly satisfying. So satisfying, in fact, that she let out a little moan. At that moment, Calypso came on top of her, and everything got hit: Her pillow, her hair, her face, her neck and some salty semen even got into her mouth. Overwhelmed by disgust, she jolted upwards, forcing the prince back into reality after his orgasm by almost making him fall over. Amelia retched and leaned over the bedside as her breakfast returned to the outside world. Calypso told her how sorry he was again and again while he was holding back his vomiting fiancees hair. When she stopped gagging, she turned around to face him and said &quot;I should be sorry. All this just came so suddenly and I was not prepared. But from tomorrow night on, you can safely dispose this elsewhere inside my body, and judging from the quantity, we will be blessed with many strong children.&quot; At that moment, Calypso knew that she loved him and he loved her, so despite the fact that she had just vomited he answered her with a kiss. &quot;I'm afraid you have to leave know, or else the maid will suspect something. Could you tell her I'm not well?&quot; Calypso grinned. &quot;I will do so, looking at the floor it is easy to believe. Goodbye, Amelia, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.&quot; &quot;So do I, farewell, my strong prince&quot; she responded, and after a last short kiss Calypso left the room. A minute later the maid came in and saw her mistress lying in bed with a puddle of vomit besides her. &quot;Oh my god, shall the marriage be postponed, mylady?&quot;, she asked. &quot;I am sure that will not be necessary, I just ate a little too much yesterday evening, I'm already feeling better now.&quot; said Amelia and smiled at the thought of the wedding night ahead.</p>
