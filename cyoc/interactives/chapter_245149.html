<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ice awakes an hour later, grinning at Ken who still has a blank expression on his face due to still being under the trance. The fox-man rolls over so Ken is lying on his back before pulling his cock out of Ken’s pussy with a wet pop, he then simply claims off of the bed and puts his boxer briefs and shorts back on, he then grins down at Ken, “hehe… until next time… Selena,” he chuckles before turning and exiting the room.<br />
<br />
The second the door closes behind him Ice smirks when he hears a muffled groan and a confused sounding voice saying, “what… happened?”<br />
<br />
Ice chuckles as he starts to walk down the hallway, “now, where did that little foxy-boy get to,” he asks himself, “I need to… hehe… “thank” him too. I’ll check the game room first”.<br />
<br />
However, as Ice stands by the elevators the doors open to reveal Tyler, the 12-year-old fox-boy’s eyes widen, “whoa! Sweet costume,” he squeaks, stepping out, not recognizing Ice.<br />
<br />
Ice chuckles, “hey there, Tyler,” he says, “don’t you recognize me?”<br />
<br />
Tyler’s eyes, if possible, seem to widen more, “Ice? Holy… crap,” he says, looking the fox-man up and down, “you look amazing!”<br />
<br />
Ice again chuckles, his tail wagging, “why, thank you, Tyler,” he says, “where are your friends?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, they stayed in the gaming room,” Tyler says, “I am on my way back to my room, because I want to have some time… well… out of these clothes. They are starting to get annoying”.<br />
<br />
Ice chuckles, “yeah, I get that,” he says, “your brother is… resting, so why don’t you come with me to my room? There we both can enjoy being out of these pesky clothes”.<br />
<br />
Tyler tilts his head, thinking about it, “well… okay,” he then says, shrugging, “I don’t want to disturb my bro”.<br />
<br />
Ice wags his tail, “then follow me,” he says, pressing the button of the elevator and stepping in when the door opens, “my room is on the fifth floor, so two floors up”.<br />
<br />
Tyler follows Ice into the elevator, then to his room, “so, are you happy with what Ken has done?”<br />
<br />
“More than happy,” Ice says, nodding and smiling as he looks at the smaller vulpine, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles back, his own tail wagging, “I’m glad,” he says.<br />
<br />
“We’re here,” Ice then says, stopping in front of a door and opening it, “come on in, make yourself comfortable”.<br />
<br />
Tyler steps into the room, “well, it’s not as roomy as mine,” he says, looking around at the simple, one bed, room, “but it is enough for a single person”.<br />
<br />
Ice chuckles, the door closing behind him, “I’m happy with it,” he says, leading Tyler into the room, “time to get out of these pants and underwear,” he then says and begins to strip.<br />
<br />
Tyler, at first, hesitates, feeling slightly uncomfortable with an adult getting naked, but he then shrugs, ‘what’s the big deal,’ he asks himself, ‘we are both boys, only that he is a little older than me,’ and with that, the 12-year-old fox-boy strips out of his shorts and underwear.<br />
<br />
Ice lets out a whistle, “I must say, Tyler,” he says, “for a 12-year-old, you have a pretty athletic body”.<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles, “yeah, thanks, I take a lot of pride in my body,” he says, his tail wagging, “it’s all thanks to my sports activities. I play soccer, basketball, and I also do parkour”.<br />
<br />
“Sweet, I love doing those things myself,” Ice says, sitting down on a couch in the room, letting out a relaxed sigh and as he locks eyes with Tyler, he activates his hypnotic stare.<br />
<br />
Tyler suddenly feels a little weird, “wow, your eyes look so… mesmerizing,” he says, “I can’t stop looking at them, nor can I stop looking at your body,” the fox-boy’s eyes wandering down before they come to rest on Ice’s sheath. The 12-year-old fox-boy gulps hard, “man… you’re so much bigger than me,” he says, looking down at his own little sheath, “I wonder if mine will get just as big when I’m older”.<br />
<br />
Ice chuckles, “oh, I don’t think your sheath is tiny,” he says, “it’s rather cute and just the right size for a fox your age. Be proud of it, because you are defiantly bigger than any 12-year-old human,” he adds with a grin and wink.<br />
<br />
Tyler can’t help but to smirk, “fair point,” he says.<br />
<br />
Unaware to Tyler, Ice has used his new powers to cause the young vulpine to be more relaxed and more open to suggestions, making sure that Tyler will feel like any decision he should make will be out of his own free will, unaware that he’s being controlled by Ice’s influence.<br />
<br />
“Have you ever done a RP,” Ice asks suddenly.<br />
<br />
Tyler tilts his head, “RP?”<br />
<br />
“I guess not,” Ice chuckles, “RP stands for “role play”, you might call it a “game of pretend”. It’s a lot of fun”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see,” Tyler says, “nah, I never did something like that, what kind of role plays are there?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, hundreds,” Ice says, “you can be whatever you want, the “story” can be set in any genre, like medieval or sci-fi”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, cool,” Tyler says.<br />
<br />
Ice smiles, “I was wondering, would you like to do a role play with me?”<br />
<br />
Tyler tilts his head, “what kind of role play would it be?”<br />
<br />
“I was thinking of an medieval role play,” Ice says, “in which I’d be the “prince” and you’d be the “princess”. So, what do you say?”<br />
<br />
“Um… I don’t know,” Tyler says awkwardly, “I mean, I’m a 12-year-old boy and you must be a lot older… plus… since I’m not a girl, I can’t be a “princess”,” he continues.<br />
<br />
“I’m 25,” Ice says, “that is the beauty of role plays: you can simply imagine yourself being older than you are, being somebody different. All you need is a lively imagination, close your eyes and try imagining yourself being a 22-year-old woman”.<br />
<br />
“A-alright, I’ll give it a try,” Tyler says, closing his eyes.<br />
<br />
Ice smirks as he lets some of his magic flow into Tyler, not to change his body, but to “help” him imagine himself as a 22-year-old vixen.<br />
<br />
After giving it some time, Ice asks, “what do you see, Tyler?”<br />
<br />
“I… I see a pretty vixen,” Tyler answers.<br />
<br />
“How does she look like,” Ice then asks.<br />
<br />
“She… she has long smooth black hair that stops in the middle of her back,” the fox-boy says, “she’s got an amazing figure… slim waist, wide hips and a big, firm and round bum”.<br />
<br />
“Dang, she does sound stunning,” Ice says, grinning, “just like a princess would look like. Now, I want you to focus on her and tell me the first name that pops into your head”.<br />
<br />
“Vi-Victoria… Vicky for short,” Tyler says.<br />
<br />
“Such a beautiful name, for such a beautiful princess,” Ice says, “you can open your eyes again, Tyler”.<br />
<br />
Tyler slowly opens his eyes, “th-that felt weird,” he says, “it felt as if I really was her… kinda creepy”.<br />
<br />
Ice nods, “that’s what RPs are: realistic games of pretend,” he says, “you don’t just pretend being someone different, you “BECOME” that person. Would you want to give it a try, I mean… doing the RP with me?”<br />
<br />
Tyler scratches the back of his neck, blushing beneath his fur, “I…,” he starts.<br />
<br />
But Ice interrupts him, “I can tell that you are curious,” he says, “I promise: the RP will stay our little secret, no one will know about it”.<br />
<br />
Tyler thinks for a while, he then slowly nods his head, “alright… I must admit that I am a little curious,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ice smiles and wags his tail, “sweet, then let’s start,” he says.</p>
