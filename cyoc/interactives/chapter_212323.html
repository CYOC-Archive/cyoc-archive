<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So you were a star player back in high school?” Mr. Huff said offhandedly to Mr. Higgins.<br />
<br />
“So you’ve heard, huh.” Mr Higgins puffed his chest, belly wobbling underneath it, and scratched his goatee. “Yeah, star running-back. So many touchdowns, I got a trophy! Almost made it to State.”<br />
<br />
“Do you have anything else?” Mr. Silvers asked impatiently.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff smirked and tapped a few things into the app. He wanted to make sure things went his way from now on. Higgins got his position as coach because he was Silvers’ nephew. They’d passed him, Mr. Huff, over for some useless fat human?! That would not do. Higgins was a mediocre coach who got mediocre results. But that was about to change.<br />
<br />
He hit enter and leaned against the door to watch the show.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Steve Higgins was leaning back against Mr. Silver’s desk, his blubbery ass providing a proper cushion, when he felt oddly warm and pleasant all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
He scratched an itch on his chest, not noticing his body hair thickening into a pelt with fingernails that were sharpening into claws. His clothes began to feel oddly loose and Steve found himself having to pull his pants up. He glanced down and saw less of himself than before. His beer-gut and bitch tits were no longer there, his body growing slimmer and lithe as he watched. <br />
<br />
It fascinated him. He pressed a thinner hand against his flabby midsection and watched, mesmerized, as the fat receded, leaving him with a flat stomach for the first time in years. Heavy muscles emerged from the flab like rocks during low tide. Then they, too receded, years of work at the gym fading away until he looked rather twinkish.<br />
<br />
Steve’s brow furrowed. Was that right? He could have sworn he was fat a moment ago. <br />
<br />
He scratched his muzzle as it grew out, his nose turning moist and black as coal, his ears growing pointed and shifting up to the top of his head. The dense fur on his chest spread across his body, engulfing it in flaming red fur. Something strained the back of his pants, so Steve pulled them down just in time for a big fluffy tail to floof out behind him. Steve stared at it in amazement, adjusting himself as his groin transformed into a soft fluffy sheathe. <br />
<br />
His legs and feet were last as they expanded out into large paws with leathery pads, his shoes unraveling and disappearing. In fact, now that he thought about it, all of his clothes had disintegrated, leaving him in the nude. Not that it mattered, since his cock was snugly in its sheathe. His paws and foot-paws were covered in pitch black fur. Combined with his red fur, Steve was pretty sure he was a fox. Which was...wrong?<br />
<br />
“Hey, YIP! Silvers, is there something off about...YIP! Me…” Steve paused and stared at the older coyote anthro who was sitting at the desk Mr. Silvers had inhabited moments ago. “...Don?”<br />
<br />
“You calling me by my name, fox?” Mr. Silvers’ muzzle curled in derision. “Didn’t they teach you better?”<br />
<br />
“W-what? Yip!” Steve clapped his paw over his muzzle. <br />
<br />
Why was he yipping every other word? His large, black-tipped ears flattened and he wagged his bushy tail from side to side in confusion, unsure of what was going on. He dropped down off his perch on the desk and found it a farther drop than usual. Wasn’t he taller than this?<br />
<br />
“Yip! I think I’m…” Steve’s head spun and he clung to the desk with his dainty paws. <br />
<br />
He watched the room grow larger around him. Why was the room growing bigger...No! He was shrinking! Holding onto the desk, he slipped lower and lower until he was only three feet tall. Normal for fox anthros.<br />
<br />
“...Shrinking.” Steve finished.<br />
<br />
His tail wagged nervously as the small fox took in his surroundings. Steve felt dizzy and confused and weirdly turned on by the two big predators in the room. Why was he even in here again? Didn’t he have towels to wash?<br />
<br />
“You’re the same size you’ve always been, fox.” Mr. Silvers rolled his eyes and turned to Mr. Huff. “You see what I have to deal with all day?”<br />
<br />
“What did you do?” Steve accused the wolf, though he felt like doing so was...wrong?<br />
<br />
“Fox, get back under the desk!” Mr. Silvers thundered.<br />
<br />
Steve timidly made his way under the desk. In front of him was Mr. Silvers’ hot, throbbing coyote dick. He could smell its virile musk now. Steve sniffed it delicately, drool slopping onto the floor. It smelled divine!<br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for? Get to work, fox.” Mr. Silvers demanded.<br />
<br />
Steve licked his chops and stared at the ruby cock in front of him. He felt an overwhelming urge to suck the coyote’s dick. It was strange, but his tongue had slid out of his muzzle and lapped at the end of Mr. Silver’s slick red cock. The flavor was strange-meaty yet neutral, though the precum was sweet. <br />
<br />
His bushy tail wagged as he took the older coyote’s member in his mouth and began to bob and suck on it. He found himself less weirded out as he coaxed another spurt of precum from the coyote’s length. Yeah, this was his purpose! He was a cocksucker, after all!<br />
<br />
The coyote howled in pleasure and shot his load down Steve’s throat.<br />
<br />
Steve let out a muffled yip and swallowed. Then he got to cleaning that potent shaft, making sure it was spotless. The coyote gently scritched him behind the ears as he did, and Steve felt happy to have sucked him off.<br />
<br />
“Good job, fox.”<br />
<br />
“No problem!” Steve grinned, his tongue lapping his blackened lips, hoping to collect a little more cum.<br />
<br />
Mr. Silvers leaned forward and clasped something around Steve’s neck. Steve reached up and found a collar at his throat. He tugged at it, the tags jangling.<br />
<br />
“W-wait, stop, what is this YIP!” Steve asked in horror.<br />
<br />
“You officially belong to me, now.” The coyote said.<br />
<br />
“N-no...that’s not-” Steve argued.<br />
<br />
“Shut your muzzle, fox!” Mr. Silver snarled, yanking on Steve’s collar. “You’re my pet, now! You’ll do what I want or you’ll be punished, got it?”<br />
<br />
Steve whined, earning himself another yank.<br />
<br />
“No whining! Sorry Mr. Huff, but this stupid fox is acting up.” Mr. Silvers said apologetically to the wolf. “I’m going to get him some proper training soon.”<br />
<br />
“No worries.” Mr. Huff leered at Steve. “Lesser Canines need to learn their place.”<br />
<br />
Steve nodded. <br />
<br />
Of course, foxes were at the bottom of the hierarchy in canine law. Only toy breeds of dogs were their lessers, though everyone knew foxes made better sex slaves.<br />
<br />
“We’re putting Axel on the team.” Mr. Huff said firmly.<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir!” Mr. Silvers said.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I like to hear.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Axel was feeling extremely uncomfortable already after his first boner.<br />
<br />
For some reason, despite being a teenage wolf who never wore clothes, it was the first time for him to experience it at school. That didn’t make logical sense. He could remember having boners all the time at really inconvenient times, like right after being called to the front of class to write an answer on the whiteboard.<br />
<br />
And now he was having a mini-crisis, went to his dad… and his dad just laughed at him. And now his cock was even bigger, jutting merrily in front of him, bobbing with every step. He tried hiding behind a backpack or a few textbooks, but people had already noticed and some jocks were following him around.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, faggot? Why are you so hard?” Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
The tall jock was moderately good-looking, black hair but with a broken nose from the fights he got into. Now that he had found a new target, he wasn’t going to stop. Axel knew that. His two friends were always with him. There was Dylan, who was shorter and blonde and on the wrestling team. Then there was Austin, a muscular and lean redhead who never spoke a word, just stood there with an amused expression when his friends tortured Axel.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, furry freak. Wear some fucking pants!” Dylan laughed, shoving Axel forward, making him stumble and drop his books.<br />
<br />
Other students were staring at Axel now, giggling. Axel’s ears laid back against his head and his tail tucked itself between his legs. Why was he so fucking horny?! Why wouldn’t the boner go away? <br />
<br />
Normally, if he was embarrassed or sad, his dick would retract back into its warm sheathe. But with every taunt, it seemed to throb harder, precum dribbling down the crimson shaft onto the carpet, leaving a trail on the ground as he walked.<br />
<br />
“Hey Axel, nice dick!” Josh, his nerdy best friend said, coming up to walk alongside him.<br />
<br />
Axel blushed furiously, tears wetting the fur around his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, the horny furfag has a boyfriend!” Jeremy taunted.<br />
<br />
“What’s their problem?” Josh asked. “You have a big dick. Are they jealous?”<br />
<br />
“W-what?” Axel blinked.<br />
<br />
“Everyone knows you’re well-hung. What’s their problem?” Josh asked.<br />
<br />
“The problem is your boyfriend is a furry freak!” Dylan chuckled and shoved Josh against the lockers. “Freak lover!”<br />
<br />
Axel hunched and scurried to class, Josh following confusedly behind him. <br />
<br />
History class was taught by Mr. Harries. The balding older man could put anyone to sleep with his lectures. For some reason, he could make even the most interesting history seem rather boring. <br />
<br />
In class, no one seemed upset with Axel’s big, throbbing cock. Not even the teacher commented on it, though he noticed his classmates shooting it glances when they though he wasn’t looking. He wondered if someone could die of shame. Axel buried his snout in his paws.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Kevin, another guy in class, asked. <br />
<br />
“My boner won’t go away.” Axel whispered.<br />
<br />
“What?” Kevin blinked at him. “So?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean ‘so’?” Axel hissed, shifting uncomfortably as his cock twitched hotly.<br />
<br />
“You have the biggest dick in class! Why would you be embarrassed about it?” Kevin asked, brow raised.<br />
<br />
Axel turned and stared at him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Axel, everyone wishes they could have a cock like yours!” Jason a blonde boy sitting next to him said, sniffing the air and licking his lips. “Or just have a quick taste…”<br />
<br />
Axel’s cock twitched again, making Axel moan before clapping a paw over his muzzle and blushing heavily under his fur. W-why were his classmates acting so weird? Was that why they were staring at his cock so hungrily.<br />
<br />
“I’d ride that tool any day!” Jenny giggled, the beautiful cheerleader running her tongue around her lips.<br />
<br />
“It’s so beautiful, ruby red, glistening,” Sam, another of Axel’s nerdy friends said, “And it smells so masculine, I wish I could bottle it and sell it to Dior!”<br />
<br />
“Class, please stop talking about Axel’s big, luscious wolf cock and pay attention!” Mr. Harris boomed. Everyone fell silent, though they still shot looks at Axel’s cock. Once the kids were suitably quieted, Mr. Harris continued with his lecture. “Anyways, the Owl Mountains were located in Germany where Hitler…”<br />
<br />
Axel was feeling less embarrassed and just uncomfortable when he left class. His next one would be with his dad. His father insisted he be referred to as Mr. Huff, even from him. It was kinda weird but dad said it was about professionalism or something.<br />
<br />
“Hey freak!” Dylan shouted behind him.<br />
<br />
Axel’s heart sank. <br />
<br />
Austin, Dylan and Jeremy were in Mr. Huff’s Biology class along with him. He’d been so weirded out about the whole cock thing and his classmate’s strange reactions that he’d forgotten all about them. The rest of the school seemed fine with his cock being exposed, but they sure weren’t.<br />
<br />
He guessed bullies were always bullies for no reason.<br />
<br />
“Running to big daddy freak, Axe-hole?” Jeremy chuckled. “Comparing freak dicks?”<br />
<br />
Axel cringed. They always said it like ‘asshole’. He wished they would just stop bothering him. Everyone else seemed nice enough about his big dick. Some even openly lusted over it as it bobbed in front of him. Still, he covered himself, terrified the two bullies might smack it.<br />
<br />
His father was in the classroom as Axel walked in, writing something on the whiteboard. He glanced over at Axel and frowned. The frown deepened when he noticed the two bullies follow him in, still making fun of his son. Axel thought he saw an angry glitter in his eye as he pulled out his phone.</p>
