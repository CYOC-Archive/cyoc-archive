<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wow, that was the best! That was...oh wow!&quot; John was ecstatic. He had never received a blow job before. He didn&#39;t even have a word for what just happened. &quot;Felt so good...&quot;<br />
His mother smiled. She had no idea she had just given her 9 year old son a blow job as he now looked like his 35 year old father. She ran a hand through his now very hairy, muscular chest. Short curls of fur stood all over his muscles. His armpits had big tufts of hair bursting out of them and they reeked now. John noticed that in his father&#39;s body, his armpits were really stinky. Maybe he should try the stuff Dad put on them. The deodorant stuff. Wow, he was old enough to use deodorant now! He was excited about so many things. He smiled. He was so happy right now. Mommy looked happy, too. She smiled. <br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re pretty,&quot; John said, appreciatively. Mom looked like she was good enough to be a model and make commercials. She was way prettier than other kid&#39;s moms he&#39;d met. He definitely liked the feeling of being naked with his big penis. It felt way better than before when he was just a runt. <br />
&quot;Well, it looks like you&#39;re having a good time. Let&#39;s snuggle for a little bit. Put your boxers back on and we&#39;ll go back downstairs to check on the boys in about ten minutes.&quot; <br />
John complied by getting his father&#39;s boxer shorts on. It was wild. His big dick now tented against his father&#39;s underwear, and it would have tented around him just a few days ago! He looked into the small wall mirror and started fooling around, flexing his muscles. <br />
&quot;Ooooh, my man is getting so buff! I&#39;m glad you took at least one day off from the gym to spend more time with us, but I don&#39;t want to get in the way of your goals. You should go tomorrow. And then you should come home right afterwards and fuck me,&quot; she said, seductively, wrapping her arms around his muscular frame. Mommy was only about as tall as his chest now! He was way taller! <br />
&quot;Huh? What&#39;s that?&quot; <br />
&quot;Huh, what&#39;s that? I want you to put that big dick inside my hole and fuck me until I scream.&quot; she whispered. <br />
John&#39;s jaw dropped. Wow! Grownups get to have all the fun. He had already felt pretty good when Mommy put her mouth around his dick and he cummed inside her there. He wondered how it would feel to actually...fuck..his mother. That&#39;s what fuck meant? He thought it was just a bad word. He didn&#39;t know it meant sex! It sounded so dirty and wrong. Like, he shouldn&#39;t be allowed to say that word but he suddenly realized he was an adult and he could say any word he wanted to! <br />
&quot;Yeah, we should FUCK. I should FUCK you.&quot; John grinned. He was allowed to say any words he wanted to now! Mommy...that is, Cindy...pushed him onto the bed and they rolled around in the sheets a little bit. She pressed herself against his firm muscular arms and she planted a kiss on his lips. His short beard, maybe a week old (his Dad liked to grow it out every now and then) scraped against her smooth creamy skin. He moaned. And then he kissed her back, long and deep. He enjoyed it more and more and held her in his firm arms, his biceps taut and rounded. He stared into her eyes. He was mesmerized by how amazing it was. He&#39;d never kissed a girl before! He hoped cooties weren&#39;t real. Maybe they weren&#39;t real for adults and just kids. Adults kissed in movies a lot so they probably were okay. And parents kissed and stuff but he&#39;d never paid attention to that icky stuff. Now, though, he felt overwhelmed by how amazing it felt to kiss Cindy. His mother was so...<br />
<br />
John realized he wasn&#39;t alone. His nine year old former body, now inhabited by his father, was staring at him dumbfounded. <br />
&quot;Honey, you&#39;re not supposed to come into our room unannounced. What is it?&quot; his mother asked his former body. His father spoke. <br />
&quot;I just need to talk to Dad for a minute. Please, Dad? It&#39;s important. It&#39;s about that thing.&quot; <br />
&quot;What thing?&quot; <br />
&quot;It&#39;s a guy thing,&quot; Bob replied in his son&#39;s body, sounding very believable as a 9 year old boy. <br />
&quot;Oh, I see. Well that does sound important.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you later, Mommy. I mean, Cindy.&quot; <br />
&quot;i&#39;ll see you later, tiger.&quot; <br />
John stood up at his new full height of 6&#39;2&quot;. It was so much fun being tall! He waved awkwardly to his slightly confused mother before Bob grabbed him and dragged him out of the room and down the hall to his new bedroom. They shut the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, SON?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not your son. You&#39;re my son, even if you are bigger than me now.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m WAY bigger! Hey, how much do I weigh now? I must be like 200 pounds now!&quot; <br />
&quot;You&#39;re actually...215 pounds. It&#39;s mostly muscle.&quot; <br />
&quot;WHOA! I do weight more than you! WAY way more! Haha.&quot; John stood way above his father, flexing his muscles. It was messing with Bob&#39;s mind to have to look UP to see adults now. John wasn&#39;t wearing a shirt and he felt the hairy pecs and veiny arms that used to be his father&#39;s. <br />
&quot;You...you were kissing Mommy.&quot; <br />
&quot;It was fun. She also put her mouth on my penis! And the cum stuff came out, Dad! This is awesome. I love being Dad.&quot; <br />
&quot;NO! Oh my GOD. You had sex with your mother!&quot; <br />
&quot;Nuh uh. She&#39;s not my Mommy. She&#39;s your Mommy. I&#39;m the big strong grown up now and you aren&#39;t so neener neener neener! I&#39;m BIG and YOU&#39;RE small! Ha ha HA HA ha!&quot; John sang song immaturely. <br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do these grown up things anymore. You&#39;re only a little boy in there!&quot; <br />
&quot;Can you drive now, SON? I can. I&#39;m a grown up and I can drive whenever I want.&quot; <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how..HOW did you learn to drive? How did we even swap bodies? You must know something!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how we switched bodies, Da-I mean..Son. I&#39;m a super big adult type guy and I haven&#39;t been a kid for a long time cause I&#39;m super old.&quot; <br />
&quot;35 is not super old. And you can&#39;t have sex. You&#39;re too young. It&#39;s too weird!&quot; <br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s not. Mommy thinks I&#39;m you now.&quot; John smirked and laughed stupidly. He then picked Bob up without warning by the armpits and held him up in midair, and then adjusted so he was carrying his own father with one arm. He opened up the bedroom door and quickly walked to the bathroom. <br />
&quot;Look at how strong I am! I can pick you up! I can be the Daddy now!&quot; <br />
&quot;I feel like screaming at you,&quot; Bob said under his breath.<br />
&quot;Why? I&#39;m doing you a favor. You&#39;re the one that gets to go to school. I&#39;m the one who has to go to work and earn money. Just like you used to. Only now I do it, so I get to be bigger,&quot; John said smugly. <br />
&quot;I thought you said my job was no problem. I should have guessed. You having a tough time selling fruit to vendors? It isn&#39;t easy. I&#39;ve got years of experience with it, though,&quot; <br />
&quot;I can do it, too! And I can do it better than YOU can!&quot; John was sounding very immature for a 35 year old man. It was like he was doing an impression of his spoiled 9 year old son. <br />
&quot;We have to find a way to switch back!&quot; <br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just enjoy it? I mean, I&#39;m not even tired and I&#39;ve been holding you up for like five minutes!&quot; John finally put his little father down. &quot;Heyyyy. I bet I have to SHAVE now, huh!&quot; John had a huge smile plastered across his face as he felt his stubble with both hands, wondrously running his hands over a week&#39;s worth of facial hair growth. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll teach you to shave if you want. You should learn, I guess. So you really have no idea why we switched places?&quot; <br />
&quot;Nope! I dunno,&quot; John shrugged. &quot;But YOU have to call me DAD from now on. I&#39;m Bob now. But you call me Dad, mister. If you know what&#39;s good for you. Now teach me to shave.&quot; <br />
So Bob did. He showed his son the brush and the shaving cream. He also had bottles of cologne and aftershave. John eagerly applied the cream all over his face, using a little too much. He smiled. This was so cool! He was the only 4th grader in the world that was 6&#39;2&quot; and 215 pounds and looked like a grownup. And he could shave and drive and everything! As Bob taught him to use a razor, John carefully followed his former father&#39;s advice. <br />
&quot;Yeah, okay. I&#39;m gettin&#39; the hang of this! This is cool!&quot; <br />
&quot;Okay, so let&#39;s go over what you did at work. How did you know what to do?&quot; <br />
&quot;I dunno. It&#39;s like I just knew what to look up on the computer. I used a computer! You didn&#39;t even have to show me how or nothin&#39;!&quot; <br />
&quot;So you must be...channeling something from my body&#39;s memory. Like when people get heart transplants, sometimes they have food cravings for things they never ate before. Or their behavior changes slightly.&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, like your body knew that I had to like, call the people on the list and then take care of some shipments. And I talked to some farmer who wanted to sell us blueberries. He was cool.&quot; <br />
&quot;This is unreal. You&#39;re nine but you can drive and do my job with no problem. There has to be some explanation for this!&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, I think we should go downstairs and watch some TV. You wanna watch Spongebob? I&#39;m on Season 2 and i really like all the characters so far!&quot; John said with his enthusiastic but baritone adult voice. John seemed to retain a lot of who he was but with the body of a man far advanced in experience. At least if he was in the same room as both Cindy and John he could potentially avoid them getting too friendly. <br />
<br />
Alas, it was not to be. John spent the rest of the night snuggling with his Mommy and they would kiss here and there when they thought Bob wasn&#39;t looking. Bob changed the channel to sports instead of the mindless cartoon his son was engrossed with. A 35 year old with the tastes of a 9 year old. Yeah, nothing could possibly go wrong there. What was going to happen? <br />
<br />
Soon, it was time for bed. Both of his &quot;parents&quot; hugged him good night. Bob saw the knowing smirk on John&#39;s face. You couldn&#39;t wipe that smile off of him! He glowered in the dark hoping beyond hope that his son just fell asleep soon and didn&#39;t explore anything further with his own mother. This was all some kind of lucid nightmare, he thought, as he snuggled into his Scooby Doo jammies and fell fast asleep.<br />
<br />
The next day...</p>
