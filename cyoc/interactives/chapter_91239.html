<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">New sister. The words rang through my mind in more than one way. I remembered everything about my past. I remembered being born Haley Johnson. I remembered growing up human and all I had done to resist the Lycothans after my capture. But now things were different. I was now a warrior Lycothan and good part of me was happy to be one. It was strange. I hadn&#39;t fully believed Lartara in her earlier attempts to explain that, but now as I stood up onto my presently digitgrade feet, I did feel happy at the strength and power that now resided within me. I was happy at the cheers and howls that answered my own. It was as Lartara had said, that the others would accept me once I changed, and I had. They were Warrior Lycothans and so was I. They were my sisters, just as Lartara was... though she was more of an &quot;older sister,&quot; and a part of me actually saw her as something more, for all that she had done for me. <br />
<br />
I felt happy to have sisters. Yet the warriors outside Lartara&#39;s room were a different kind of sister from what I remembered. I&#39;d had a human sister, her name was Katie. I had loved her, and we did a lot of things growing up together, but when we grew up and got through college, we ended up in different lives. I&#39;d majored in business management and had been running a small grocery when I had been captured and began my journey to becoming Harkaal, the Lycothan version of Haley. My sister had majored in English literature and was a teacher in a different town. We had been fairly close, but schedules meant that we didn&#39;t see each other as often as we would have liked. I had no idea if she had escaped capture by the Lycothans and was hiding somewhere or had been captured and, like me, was now something other than human. I hoped wherever Katie was, she was safe. For the moment that was all I could do for her, and at present, I had new sisters to meet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;d best not disappoint them,&quot; I said to Lartara as a stood up and looked over to her.<br />
<br />
Lartara nodded. And I could see that in transforming me, she had also fully shifted forms. Her eyes had gone a solid gold and even the eye obscured by the part of her &quot;human&quot; hair that hung over it was fairly visible as it seemed to glow with a bright inner light. I assumed my own eyes now carried the same inner glow as I looked through the hair that hung over my own eye. The silver streak was clear obvious, though it didn&#39;t seem to obscure my vision. I wondered if Lycothans simply had better eyesight than humans or there was something else.  Lartara was beautiful in her wolven form. Her musculature looked even larger, as did her breasts, but everything looked perfect in a way, and her fur lay perfectly on every curve of her body. Surprisingly, the uniform she wore and hadn&#39;t removed to change me was still on and hadn&#39;t snapped when Lartara changed. It was a surprise, but didn&#39;t remove the amazing amount of recognition of Lartara&#39;s beauty that I now had. I only wished I could get to a mirror and see what I had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lartara nodded, &quot;and don&#39;t worry about a uniform... the cloth is stretchy and won&#39;t irritate your fur in &quot;wolf form&quot; and is designed for being appropriate considering our ability to shift forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and followed Lartara as she moved back toward the door to the rest of the barracks where I would introduce the other warriors to Harkaal. I actually began wagging my tail at the prospect. Lartara opened the door and stood aside as I ducked through the doorway.The building that had been built for humans didn&#39;t really accommodate my now much larger form that I had taken. I was greeted  seeing all the other Warriors, who had earlier looked on me teasingly as Eira had or either in disinterest as others had while I was still human, who know looked on me with a bit of a smile, as now I was their sister, and they my sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, sisters,&quot; I said to them, &quot;I am Harkaal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Harkaal,&quot; one of them who had hair a different shade of black from Lartara&#39;s said to me, &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel great,&quot; I answered with a bit of a smile, which probably looked a bit funny as the wolfish muzzle I presently had, since animal muzzles weren&#39;t designed for human facial movements, though I was no longer human and the people I was talking to weren&#39;t human either, &quot;I feel stronger... stronger than I&#39;ve ever been before... and our captain was so friendly to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked over at Lartara as she only smiled, likely proud and knowing full well that I&#39;d be accepted by the others once I became a Lycothan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Captain Lartara&#39;s always looked after us,&quot; another commented, &quot;you&#39;ll love it here with us, sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, now mentally relishing the musky scent of all the others had. With my own enhanced senses, I could now tell the difference between each and every one of the Lycothans in the room by scent alone. I only knew Lartara and Eira by name, but I could recognize the differences in each of their respective musk. Each individual had a musk that was unique to them. And my own was probably stronger at the moment due tot he sexual nature of my transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you did shape up well,&quot; Eira came forward, smiling, though now friendly way, &quot;Look... you can even see her freckles in her fur!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down toward my greatly enlarged chest, counting both muscle and maternal material. My dark nipples still stood attention and poked through the red fur on my breasts, though the color on my breasts and belly was more of a lighter shade of red then the fur on the rest of my body, my hair (apart from the silver stripe), and around new vagina. There my fur was a darker shade of red, and I quickly noticed were several spots where my freckles would be in my more human like form where my fur was darker, even in the ruff of fur just above and between my breasts. I gave a slightly embarrassed chuckle and wondered how many other Lycothans had freckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be mean!&quot; another commented, &quot;I think she looks cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute?&quot; Eira answered, &quot;Cute doesn&#39;t describe her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eira then leaped into the air at me. At first I thought it was some attack and in my more wolven state, I caught her easily, but it wasn&#39;t an attack. The Valkyrie that Eira became had her arms wrapped around my neck with a friendly smile on her face as she looked at me with her own gold flaked blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful... drop dead gorgeous would be more appropriate,&quot; Eira continued and kissed the tip of my muzzle, &quot;Don&#39;t you think, Harkaal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know... I haven&#39;t been able to see the new me, yet,&quot; I answered and licked her cheek.<br />
<br />
I still remembered what few times I had been around to talk with Emily while we had been prisoners. Seeing her as she was now and getting used to her as Eira might take a little getting used to, especially since I still remembered being Haley. But, I had become Harkaal as well, and I was glad to be with my new sisters. I also knew that I would need their help and support, not just in terms of what would happen when I interacted with those that were still prisoners, as they might see me as a traitor or would simply be afraid of me, but also in terms of dealing with the Alpha that thought having Casey, a scared girl, raped was a good idea. I became Harkaal to spare Casey that fate, but it was Lartara&#39;s treatment of me that made me accept the change. I would be loyal to my sisters, but my human mind, in a way, saw the prisoners as sisters too. They had a right to choose their own fate, and that Alpha was not one to give the prisoners much of a choice, as she had demonstrated.<br />
<br />
My thoughts were interrupted for the moment when Lartara spoke calmly. &quot;Trust me, Harkaal. You are beautiful.&quot; Lartara then turned her head to the others, &quot;Now, your new sister has introduced yourself. Why not introduce yourselves so she knows the names of her sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
I set Eira down and looked around the room. Not counting Eira, Lartara, and myself there were eight others there. They were either leaning against walls or were seated on the beds of the barracks. The beds easily held the weight of the Valkyrie on them, and given what you remembered as you walked through the first time, you figured the beds probably also held weight of a fully shifted Lycothan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Eira,&quot; Eira spoke, introducing herself, &quot;I only joined this morning... you and I will be new recruits together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I believe you said something of a first date when I came in?&quot; I teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see...&quot; Eira only laughed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Raksha,&quot; said the warrior, who had asked how you felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Verozza,&quot; said a warrior, who apart from her silver streak had sandy blond hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Marrh,&quot; said a warrior with very dark brown hair, almost black but not quite.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Sartari,&quot; said a warrior who had very light colored hair, almost white, though she wasn&#39;t old by any means. In fact all of the warriors there, including Lartara, looked like they were between the ages of 19 and 30, though I didn&#39;t know on how Lycothans aged. For all I knew some of the warriors here got younger when they changed...<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Tarrgh,&quot; said a warrior with brown hair, the same shade as Eira&#39;s, but unlike Eira who had gold flaked blue eyes, Tarrgh had gold flaked brown eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Lexeira,&quot; said a warrior with black hair, which seemed to have some luster two it in the barrack&#39;s lighting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Nyl,&quot; said a warrior with reddish colored hair, a shade or two lighter than your own. She had been the one who said you looked cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am Lesroia,&quot; said the last warrior present, her hair was either a very light brown or a very dark blond.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pleased to meet you, my sisters,&quot; I said to them, and I found it to be very honest. All my memories were there, so were Lycothan instincts. These warriors may not be related to me by blood, but the bond would be close enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that we all know each other,&quot; Nyl commented, &quot;The Alphas don&#39;t take shifts. When the day is over, they&#39;re all done for it...so Harkaal can&#39;t report in until tomorrow morning... The Servants that run the barbers shop have likely closed, meaning Harkaal will also have to wait until tomorrow to have sides of her head shaved... And she can&#39;t go on duty until after that happens...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I intend for to have Harkaal and Eira on the same shift,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;So I can supervise their training...&quot;<br />
<br />
I said nothing, though I realized on how much things had just changed for me that went beyond the fur, fangs, and power. I had been a prisoner of the Lycothans for a long time. Now, I would likely a guard there. Part of me was excited about that and part of me was nervous. I watched as Nyl nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what shall we do?&quot; Nyl then asked toward both you and Lartara.</p>
