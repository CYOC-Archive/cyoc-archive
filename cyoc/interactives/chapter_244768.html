<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mason sighed, his eyes glossy as he stared at his computer screen. A few days ago his siblings left. When Mason asked, they said they were dealing with the Superior Church. Mason wanted to help, but his mothers wholeheartedly refused. As they said, he was too young.<br />
<br />
That was the hard part about being a teenager, you were old enough to have some freedoms, but still under your parents rule. Watching his siblings go, Mason proceeded to head to his room and sulk as he mindlessly began to play video games.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the fourth match you&#39;ve lost in a row,&quot; Fenrir said.<br />
<br />
Mason glanced back, noting the magical dog sprawled across his bed. He had assumed he was sleeping, it was one of Fenrir&#39;s favorite activities. Mason usually smirked when he noticed him. Fenrir, the mythological canine of Norse legend laying on his back, tongue lolling out of his mouth, leg twitching from REM sleep. He alway tried to keep the noise down when Fenrir napped, only waking him when he occasionally let out a fart, which the family joked could peel wallpaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t realize you were up,&quot; Mason replied. &quot;I didn&#39;t wake you did I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ve been awake for some time,&quot; Fenrir replied. &quot;I usually am whenever you start playing. I try not to interrupt you, seeing how competitive you can be in your games. That&#39;s why I&#39;m surprised to see your current losing streak. Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know maybe,&quot; Mason sighed. &quot;I... I just wish I was helping. The Superior Church went after me and ever since then I&#39;ve been stuck at home while everyone else is out trying to stop them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fenrir yawned, stretching before taking a seat, the wolf dog now gazing intently at his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do this because they care for you Mason,&quot; he replied. &quot;Your parents, your siblings, even your Uncle Fukushu, which is surprising. Most people assume he cares for no one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that,&quot; Mason shrugged. &quot;But I&#39;m almost seventeen Fenrir. I&#39;m not six. I don&#39;t need to be tucked into bed or wrapped in bubble wrap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is the fate of the youngest sibling Mason,&quot; Fenrir replied. &quot;They are both the freest and at the same time most protected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound like your speaking from experience,&quot; Mason smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I too have siblings Mason,&quot; Fenrir said. &quot;I&#39;ve seen how family dynamics play out over centuries.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of the front door opening now drew Mason and Fenrir&#39;s attention. It was still too early for either one of his parents to be home. It could only mean his siblings had finally returned. The teen and his dog now scrambled to their feet, Fenrir&#39;s clawed feet tearing across the hall as he barreled ahead of Mason. Both sprinting down the stairs as they noticed Aaron and Nyx now enter the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you&#39;re home! How&#39;d it go?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron raised his head, immediately clueing Mason into the fact that something was wrong. Aaron&#39;s face was ashen, his eyes red as if he had been crying for hours. The young man&#39;s shoulders slumped, his foot steps heavy. Mason paused. Why did Aaron look like someone died.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going upstairs,&quot; Aaron said sadly, his voice catching in his throat. Nyx simply nodded, watching as Aaron trudged upstairs before closing the door to his room. Now Mason was worried as he glanced at Nyx who seemed anxious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nyx, what&#39;s going on,&quot; Mason asked anxiously. &quot;Is everything okay? Did something happen to Kari or Haley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re okay Mason,&quot; Nyx said softly. &quot;Everyone is okay. They headed to the kitsune realm. It has to do with the Superior Church....and Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is...is..he dead?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No he&#39;s alive,&quot; Nyx stated. &quot;But...he&#39;s lost it. I....I&#39;ve never seen...heard rumors but... he was so.....cruel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened Nyx,&quot; Mason asked. &quot;What happened with my uncle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nyx shook herself from her own doldrums. She had been replaying their interactions with the fearsome kitsune the entire ride home. How cruel he was with his words. How hateful he was in his actions. The rage that seemed to permeate from the kitsune, it was almost palpable. Fukushu wouldn&#39;t stop, not until everyone even associated with the Superior Church was dead...and there was only one person who could possibly reason with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason,&quot; Nyx asked. &quot;You and your uncle, you&#39;re close right? Like, really close?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason paused, remembering Fukushu showing him the memorial. A memorial to Fukushu&#39;s older brother Raiden. A brother no one save he and Fukushu knew about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep it brief,&quot; Nyx said quickly. &quot;Fukushu...your uncle. He&#39;s gone mad. He&#39;s determined to hurt a lot of people... a lot of innocent people. He won&#39;t listen to anyone, but he might listen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think he would listen to Mason?&quot; Fenrir asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he says he is doing this for Mason,&quot; Nyx said softly. &quot;To keep him safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason turned white. He had heard stories about Fukushu, about the kitsune lust for vengeance. During his years traveling to the kitsune realm, he remembered whispers of Fukushu&#39;s deeds. The names he was known by. Death Fox. Dark Samauri. Angel of Vengeance.<br />
<br />
Mason never truly believed them though. That wasn&#39;t the uncle he had come to know throughout his life. Sure, Fukushu was grumpy, antisocial, stern, but genocidal? Murderous? Evil? That wasn&#39;t Fukushu, was it?<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s not my uncle, it can&#39;t be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason,&quot; Nyx said, before pausing. How could she explain this. She had seen the look on the kitsunes face, heard his words, seen what he had done to Chase. Said to Aaron...and to her. &quot;I...I know it&#39;s hard to hear but, your uncle. He...he has a very dark side. He may have tried to change but, something deep inside him snapped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you would put my master at risk,&quot; Fenrir asked, his dander standing on end. &quot;Why?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir wait,&quot; Mason interrupted. All quieted as Mason stepped forward, locking eyes with Nyx. &quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; he said firmly. &quot;Not because everyone thinks he&#39;s dangerous, but because I know he isn&#39;t. He&#39;s not who everyone thinks he is. I know it! If it means I have to talk to him, I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Fenrir asked. Mason nodded, the pair looking to Nyx.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I want you to help,&quot; Nyx said. &quot;I have to be sure. Aaron....Aaron wouldn&#39;t forgive me if something happened to you. Are you absolutely positive about this. You&#39;ll help us stop him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do this Nyx,&quot; Mason replied. &quot;I know my uncle. He&#39;ll listen to me. I&#39;m positive he will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can help Mason find him,&quot; Fenrir added. &quot;I am familiar with his scent. We will find him and keep him from hurting the innocent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nyx said, her voice tense. &quot;Please, be careful and good luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason nodded, both human and dog quickly leaving the house. Wherever his uncle was, Mason would find him and help Fukushu not make a mistake he would regret. Mason made a quick phone call to Anjelica as he left, telling her not to worry and what he planned to do.<br />
<br />
*********************************<br />
<br />
Alexa bit her lip, tapping her foot anxiously as she gazed at the test in the bathroom. This couldn&#39;t be happening. Glancing at her watch, she could see it had been ten minutes. Grabbing the test and the box she came in, her eyes went wide. The test was positive, just like the last two.<br />
<br />
Alexa had chalked up the bit of nausea she was feeling to the stomach flu. Afterall, a bug had been circulating through the office, it made sense. Then she found she was late this month. Considering how intimate she and Tom had been, she began to worry. She now kicked herself for not taking her birth control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa you feeling okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa squeaked, grabbing the tests and box off the sink and hastily hiding it. &quot;Um, I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it that stomach bug?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sort of,&quot; Alexa answered, staring at the tests once more. &quot;But, I&#39;m okay. Just um, stay out okay? It kinda stinks in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa now flushed the toilet, trying to cover for her lie as she turned on the shower. Thankfully, Tom had already showered, the pair were getting ready to go to work. From the briefing they received, S.P.E.A.R has finally located the headquarters of the Superior Church. Today, they would be raiding it and ending this threat once and for all.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the shower, Alexa now let the water wash over her body. What was she going to do? A stomach flu she could deal with, but this!? Sure she loved Tom, but was she ready to start a family? And what would Tom think? How would he react? Would he even be able to focus on the task at hand? Today was a big day, they needed to focus.<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, Alexa stepped out of the shower, drying herself as she now wiped the bathroom mirror. Glancing at herself, she studied her body carefully. At least she had time before she would show. It would give her plenty of time to come up with a way to tell Tom. A knock now drew her attention as Tom poked his head in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You doing okay Alexa,&quot; he asked. &quot;You look a little pale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine now,&quot; she said, forcing a smile.&quot;Probably something I ate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want I can run and get you some ginger ale,&quot; Tom offered. &quot;I know that&#39;s a sure fire cure for an upset stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds great,&quot; Alexa said.<br />
<br />
Tom smiled, placing a gentle kiss on Alexa&#39;s lips before exiting the apartment. It would take him about 15 minutes to run to the corner store and come back. Plenty of time to get dressed and dispose of the evidence. After they took down the Superior Church, she would have a long conversation with Tom. For the two of them, their relationship was about to take an unexpected and hopefully joyous turn.</p>
