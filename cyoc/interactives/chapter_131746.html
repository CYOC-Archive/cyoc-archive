<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I got home parked the car out the front used my key to open the front door then went straight to my bedroom. I could hear the television going in the lounge but wanted to hide the signs of my tears before facing Mum and Dad.<br />
<br />
I stopped the flow of tears then went to the bathroom and rinsed my face. Finally ready I went down to the lounge. Mum and Dad were snuggled up to each other on the couch watching a movie. It was a picture of how I had envisaged myself and Sarah would be in 30 year’s time. The tears welled up in my eyes again. It was all I could do to say goodnight before retreating back to the bedroom. <br />
<br />
I was too upset to bother probing emails as I had planned. So decided to go to bed. Back in the bathroom I did my ablutions then cleaned my teeth. I stripped off the clothes and put on the pajamas from under my pillow. I noticed my pajamas were slightly stained around the crotch but decided they would do for tonight. There was now quite a pile of used clothing in a basket at the foot of my bed. I would need to do a load of washing on Saturday.<br />
<br />
I set my alarm, climbed into bed and turned off the light. My thoughts as I drifted to sleep were of Sarah and the life that might have been. That was my world, my future when I was Rod, however I knew that could no longer be. I was Jenna.<br />
……<br />
I was again woken by my phone alarm at 6am. It took me a moment to orientate where I was. I didn’t feel like getting out of bed in a hurry and just lay there looking at the ceiling for 10 minutes. Maybe I was slightly depressed or maybe Jenna was just not a morning person.<br />
However soon enough my full bladder forced me to get up. I put on my dressing gown and went to the toilet. After washing my hands I headed down to the kitchen. Mum was already in the kitchen, I think she was surprised when I said “Good Morning” She was wearing a knee length blue satin nightie. I couldn’t help but admire her figure. She really was a very good looking woman. After a quick good morning to me, she disappeared into her bedroom and came back with a dressing gown on. It made me suspect the cuddle on the couch last night had continued in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
I made myself a muesli breakfast again and a cup of coffee. Dad came out of the master bedroom showered and dressed for his workshop. He was whistling.<br />
<br />
I went and had a shower, washing and drying my hair. I took the last of the Yasmin pills. I knew that meant I would now have a period over the next 7 days. I had no idea how soon it would start. I decided to play it safe and inserted a pad in my panties. I considered myself a veteran with regard to menstrual periods. <br />
<br />
I put on one of the dresses that Sarah had selected last night. She had described it as a trench dress. It was tan in color and had a sash belt. I wore the same bra as yesterday but fresh undies. Again I wore pantyhose and finished the outfit with beige shoes that Sarah had also recommended. <br />
<br />
I had time to make myself a cut lunch, also grabbing a pear from the fridge. All went into the tote bag along with the forms I had filled out last night. I said goodbye to Mum and Dad and collected Sarah’s suit and silk shirt, which I dropped into a drycleaners near work. <br />
Work was again very busy. There was very little free time to chat with Maria or the other girls. At lunchtime I went to the bank and explained that my card was no longer working (I had intentionally bent it). The teller informed me that I should receive a new card and PIN by mail in about a week. I had observed that if I didn’t think about it, I could perfectly mimic Jenna’s writing style and signature, so filling in a form for the new card did not faze me.<br />
<br />
During the afternoon I had a chance to talk to Millicent. I handed her all the forms I had filled in and also explained that I needed to take April 23rd off as I had a pre-existing appointment. That date was after the end of my 2 week trial period but I was optimistic that my job would continue. She said that wouldn’t be a problem. <br />
<br />
I also rang the hairdressers and explained that I couldn’t make my appointment on Monday because I was now working. Amy who had answered said they had a spare slot on Thursday night if that suited better. I thought to myself ’Why not’ and accepted. <br />
<br />
I stayed late to help Maria clean up the mess that the afternoon crop of school kids had created in our waiting area. I was still sweeping the floor when Millicent left at 5.30. She shooed me out. Saying it was time to go home. She needed to lock up.<br />
<br />
I rang Sarah as I walked back to my car and in a sisterly way as possible asked &quot;Hi Sarah, how has you day been? Did you end up going to work&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jenna, Yes have been at work, nothing much has happened. I got a lot of sympathy. Oh it was Helens last day, she is off on maternity leave&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any news on Rod?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I spoke to Hilda earlier who had said there had been no change in his condition. I&#39;m on my way to the hospital now&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence. Eventually she asked &quot;Are you doing anything tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ll clean out the car when I get home, but otherwise maybe see if I can retrieve emails&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve just arrived at the car park. I&#39;ll ring you if I have any news&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Ok, Bye Sarah&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Bye&quot; she hung up<br />
<br />
I drove straight home and said Hi to Mum who as usual was in the kitchen. She asked if I was home for dinner.  &quot;Yeah, that would be super. I&#39;m planning to clean out Rod&#39;s car&quot;<br />
<br />
I went to my room and changed into some jeans and a tee-shirt then went out to the car. <br />
<br />
I thoroughly searched the car, cleaning out accumulated rubbish. Systematically I worked from the glove box to the boot. I found $15 in coins but there was no sign of the medallion. <br />
<br />
Feeling a bit depressed I went back inside. Mum said dinner would be ready in 10 minutes. I returned to my bedroom and decided to look at the emails on Jenna&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
I had a look at the phone it was connected to the home wifi. I set it to open up the Gmail account. There were only 5 messages. I was disappointed to see that they were all junk mail. it looked like the account was rarely used. There was no sent mail in the last 3 months.<br />
I then opened up the second account. This was different. It said there were 15 unopened messages.  I selected to download messages for the last 7 days. The messages started coming through. A lot of them were what I considered junk. Messages generated from companies Jenna must have dealt with in the past. There were 3 messages that I thought sounded interesting. <br />
<br />
One was from someone called &#39;KatieC&#39;, &quot;Hi Emma, Your 1st lesson is Thursday night 7pm. See you then Cheers Katie&quot; The message had been sent on Tuesday. So I had missed the appointment. There was no address or anything else attached to the message. I searched for further messages from KatieC. Nothing in the last 7 days. Why was the message addressed to Emma?<br />
<br />
Another message was from &#39;Alison Banksville&#39; &#39;Hi Emma, we have a possible job on Saturday night. Give me a call if you are available, Ali&quot; This time there was a mobile phone number under the message.<br />
<br />
The third message was from &#39;James M&#39; &quot;Hi Jenna, The customer was very happy with you. I think we can get some follow-up business out of this. However we will need to keep it secret. Monique would have my balls if she ever found out I was involved. Let me know next time that you can get to Gladesville.  I hope the accommodation was fine - James&quot;<br />
<br />
My god, I thought that has to be Monique&#39;s husband James. He obviously had a side business with Jenna. I would need to check this out.<br />
However that would have to do for now. Dinner was probably ready.<br />
<br />
Eileen had prepared a cold chicken and created a salad for dinner. She asked if I was heading out later. I said I had no plans. She seemed surprised.<br />
<br />
I helped clean up after dinner then returned to my room. I had picked up my phone and was about to download older emails when a message came through &quot;Hi Jenna heading to Astons, ~11. Do you want a lift?&quot; The message was from someone called &#39;Shaz&#39; <br />
Astons was a nightclub in town. I had been there a few times when I was Zach. I looked through he message stream. Shaz seemed to be a regular clubbing partner of Jenna&#39;s. The texts talked about hot guys so I guessed Shaz was female. Should I? I wondered. If I was going to assume Jenna&#39;s life I needed to know her past. Maybe Shaz could divulge a few clues regarding the mystery that was Jenna McKenzie.<br />
I wished Sarah was with me. I would go with her. I wasn&#39;t tired, I had gone to bed early last night and had slept soundly. To be honest I was feeling a bit thrilled with the idea of dressing up this body. However if Shaz was male, well I wasn&#39;t ready for that. I decided to find out if Mum new anything.<br />
<br />
I went back to the lounge where Mum and Dad were watching the TV. &quot;Mum, do you remember my friend Shaz&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Redhead&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I was just wondering what you thought of her hairdo?&quot; Why did I just say that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Her hairdo? I can&#39;t say I have ever paid it any attention. She is certainly a good looking girl&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh never mind&quot; I retreated to my room.<br />
<br />
I heard Mum ask Dad &quot;What was that about?&quot; as I closed the door.<br />
<br />
Ok I know Shaz is female. I feel like doing something. Why not? Money I thought. I don&#39;t have much cash. I didn&#39;t like the idea of asking Mum or Dad for a loan. I remembered there was only $25 in cash in my purse. I supposed I could use the credit card. At Astons like most nightclubs you could buy drinks with tap and wave. Actually I was a female now. I probably wouldn&#39;t have to buy drinks at all. I would just have to make sure not to lead anyone on too far.<br />
<br />
I found my hands reaching for the phone. I typed out &#39;Hi Shaz. Sounds great. Are you still happy to pick me up?&#39; I hit send. Immediately I thought what am I getting myself into?<br />
<br />
Shortly a I reply came through. &quot;I&#39;ll pick you up at 10.45 Remember to wear Red&quot; It was only 8.15. I had a couple of hours to get ready.</p>
