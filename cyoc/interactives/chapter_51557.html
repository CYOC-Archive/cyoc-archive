<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lutfiyah was really excited about being in the Ivory Palace. She never thought that she would be here. Soon they came upon Jean talking with Carmen. &quot;It was just that one crossing over so far,&quot; Carmen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But more will be coming,&quot; Jean stated sure of that. She then saw Lutfiyah, Laila, and Jana and smiled saying, &quot;Welcome to the Ivory Palace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Goddess Jean,&quot; Lutfiyah said bowing a bit. At that moment Greta and Rachael appeared and Lutfiyah added, &quot;Greetings Goddess Greta. I've been wanting to meet you since The Change. I wanted to thank you in person for using the ring to make the wish changing us males into females Goddess Jean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jean and Greta were stunned by this. Only their advisers knew about the ring. &quot;How do you know?&quot; Jean asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I read about it on CYOC.net,&quot; Lutfiyah said looking confused.<br />
<br />
Greta waved a computer into existence next to them and tried going to the site. All that came up was that the domain name was for sell. &quot;Well it appears that it's not there now,&quot; she said with a sigh. &quot;It's a shame too as we could have kept tabs on what Astara was doing and planning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Lutfiyah asked. &quot;It's not for sell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can see the page saying it's for sell,&quot; Jean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can?&quot; Lutfiyah asked. &quot;But I can see the homepage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can see it then tell me what I was just doing and who this is,&quot; Greta said gesturing to the melancholy woman beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Lutfiyah said. &quot;Just let me use the computer to navigate to the right chapter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Greta said and stepped aside.<br />
<br />
Lutfiyah clicked the mouse looking as if she was navigating a web page but what was on the screen didn't change. At one point she gasped and covered her mouth with her hands saying, &quot;Oh Goddess.&quot; After some more reading she turned to the woman and said, &quot;That must be horrible for you Rachael.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What must have been horrible for me?&quot; Rachael asked looking surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you having to kill another world's Jessica,&quot; Lutfiyah said. &quot;I can't imagine how you felt when you first saw the demon revert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok how did you do that?&quot; Greta asked frowning. She didn't like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I read it on the site,&quot; Lutfiyah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just a page saying that the domain is for sell,&quot; Laila said looking worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachael can sense when something is about to happen,&quot; Lutfiyah said. &quot;She counted down to when the wave hit her school and when the demon appeared in her house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael had lost the color from her face again. This woman was telling them things she had no way of knowing. &quot;How?&quot; she asked weakly.<br />
<br />
Lutfiyah thought for a little bit then said, &quot;I don't really know how I'm doing it. I just know that I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you've read this then how did we come to be in possession of the ring?&quot; Greta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Joe had received it as a reward from an old lady who had forgot her purse,&quot; Lutfiyah began. &quot;After he used the ring on you he gave it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did he use the ring on us?&quot; Jean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really want everyone here to know that?&quot; Lutfiyah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Greta said with a sigh. She still found it humiliating what Joe had forced them to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what Astara is doing now?&quot; Jean asked looking thoughtful.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last that I read of Astara was she was really mad that Ninjatta had been destroyed and said the one who did it would suffer greatly,&quot; Lutfiyah said. &quot;She doesn't know it was you Rachael,&quot; she said seeing Rachael go even paler than before. &quot;So Jessica was a boy before the change and she's ten now. That means you became a father when you were thirteen. Who's the mother? Is it Allison?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we were young and exploring,&quot; Rachael said slowly. &quot;We didn't plan on having Jessie but the condom broke. We both took responsibility even though we weren't sure if we were ready to be parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's interesting but what's more interesting is this woman seems to be able to see what has happened with us,&quot; Carmen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what happened to the old woman who gave Joe the ring,&quot; Lutfiyah said a far away look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think she's important,&quot; Greta said. &quot;I want to ask you something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lutfiyah,&quot; Lutfiyah supplied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lutfiyah,&quot; Greta said nodding. &quot;You seem to have a gift that we can use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I'll use it to help you with Astara,&quot; Lutfiyah interrupted Greta.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you see what will happen next?&quot; Greta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can only read the chapters that have been posted,&quot; Lutfiyah said shaking her head. &quot;The last one left off with Laila, Jana, and myself entering the Ivory Palace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't seem like it's a useful gift,&quot; Jean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the contrary it just may be,&quot; Carmen said. &quot;As long as what Astara is doing is written in one of the chapters we can keep tabs on her without alerting her that we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to keep an eye on this story Lutfiyah,&quot; Greta said. &quot;If you read anything about Astara's plans let us know immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Goddess Greta,&quot; Lutfiyah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now to you Rachael,&quot; Greta said. &quot;I would like Carmen to look at your sword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Rachael said holding her sword out.<br />
<br />
Carmen took it and after a few minutes of looking it over said, &quot;This sword contains powerful magic. However it seems to be half of the whole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Greta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's something that goes with this but does something different,&quot; Carmen said.<br />
<br />
Rachael looked down at her ring and said, &quot;I think it's my ring. They didn't change when the wave hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I see it?&quot; Carmen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Rachael said and tried to take the ring off. She looked surprised and said, &quot;It won't come off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can look at it while it's on your hand,&quot; Carmen said and then took Rachael's hand. After a few moments she said, &quot;This is the other half to the sword. And after touching you I sense another magical object on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; Rachael asked stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your locket,&quot; Carmen said. &quot;Do you know what these objects do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps we can find out from their names,&quot; Carmen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Names?&quot; Greta and Jean asked together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost all magical objects have a name,&quot; Carmen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the legendary sword of King Arthur, Excalibur,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely,&quot; Carmen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what their names are though,&quot; Rachael said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The maker of the magical object is usually the one to give it it's name,&quot; Carmen said. &quot;However some objects let a person know what it's name is. I'm going to ask you what the names are and I want you to say the first thing that pops into your head. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok what's the name of your locket?&quot; Carmen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Din-o Ennyn,&quot; Rachael said immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Opening of doors,&quot; Greta said thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Rachael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddess Greta is a closet geek,&quot; Lutfiyah said. &quot;And so was I. What you said was Elvish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok next,&quot; Carmen said. &quot;What's the name of your sword?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raug Belthor,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Demon killer,&quot; Lutfiyah said nodding. &quot;An apt name for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And last what's the name of your ring?&quot; Carmen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cor-eva Coi,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ring is the other half of the sword?&quot; Greta asked looking puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Carmen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it mean?&quot; Rachael asked. &quot;Why did you ask if it was the other half of my sword?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your ring's name is opposite of your sword's,&quot; Lutfiyah said. &quot;It means ring of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ring of life?&quot; Rachael asked slowly. She looked down at her ring and said, &quot;If that's true I need to go back to my house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may be dangerous to go back there,&quot; Greta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take me back please,&quot; Rachael begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but it's not safe,&quot; Greta said. &quot;More demons may come through while you're there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael looked mad. She wanted to see if her ring would bring &quot;Jessica&quot; back to life. She fingered her locket and got an idea. A door was a portal to another place. If her locket opened doors then she might be able to use it to go home. At the thought of going home she felt some sort of power go through her and her locket opened emitting a beam of blue light. This blue light stopped a few feet in front of her and the same type of vortex that the demon came through opened up. Rachael quickly stepped through it and Greta was about to follow when it closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a portal to this world,&quot; Carmen said when Greta looked at her with a questioning look.<br />
<br />
&quot;She must have gone home,&quot; Greta said. &quot;I'll go get her.&quot; With that she disappeared.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
At Rachael's home the portal appeared in her living room. Rachael stepped out of it and closed her locket. Once her locket was closed the portal closed. She quickly walked over to &quot;Jessica&quot; and pointed her ring at her hoping she was right. Her ring started to glow and so did &quot;Jessica&quot;. Her head started to move toward her body.<br />
<br />
Greta appeared behind Rachael and watched as her ring and &quot;Jessica&quot; glowed. She knew enough about magic not to interrupt what Rachael was doing whether it was for good or not. She just hoped that it was for good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica&quot; felt herself coming back to life. She opened her eyes in time to see the woman that killed her grab her stomach and another woman come over to her asking, &quot;Are you alright Rachael?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I will be Goddess Greta,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;It feels like I was in labor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greta looked at &quot;Jessica&quot; and said, &quot;You just brought Jessica back to life. It may have that effect on you every time you do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who... who's Jessica?&quot; &quot;Jessica&quot; asked a little afraid and scooted back a bit. It was when she did this that she found she was human again. She looked at herself thankful that she was no longer a demon. She was still naked but she was human with only two arms and no tail. She broke down crying remembering what she had done as a demon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you crying Jessica?&quot; Rachael asked coming over to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica&quot; cringed away and said, &quot;My name is Amy... Amy Jo Halcomb. And I'm crying because of what I've done.&quot; She wailed at this last part and cried harder.<br />
<br />
Rachael embraced her and rocked her as she cried saying, &quot;Let it all out Amy. Let it all out.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few moment Amy had calmed down a bit. She was now snuggling into Rachael's embrace and she felt that she had to get her story out. &quot;Do you want to know how I became Ninjatta?&quot; she asked sniffling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you want to tell us,&quot; Greta said sitting down beside them.<br />
<br />
&quot;My world knew that there were others,&quot; Amy said. &quot;We had friendly relations with some of them. Some of the worlds began falling to Astara and we would send help trying to stop her advance. We accepted those that fled from their world. Eventually Astara came to our world. Our military fought them with all they had but conventional weapons weren't working. They tried biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons with little success. Finally they used the &quot;God Bomb&quot;. It worked killing most of Astara's army. Unfortunately there was only one and she was able to march over the military killing some and transforming others. My daddy was one that was killed. Astara caught me and said she was impressed with my ability to evade her demons for as long as I did. She had caught my mommy before and she put me in the same cell as her. In a lull in the fighting Astara made me into Ninjatta. She made me to find hidden defenses of worlds she wanted to conquer and to prove my loyalty to her she made me... she made me... made me eat my mommy.&quot; She wailed this last and broke down crying again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's horrible,&quot; Greta said shocked.<br />
<br />
Rachael just rocked back and forth with Amy in her arms. Eventually Amy went on saying, &quot;The worst part is that I enjoyed eating her. I swallowed her whole and I felt great joy feeling her struggle in my stomach for hours before she finally quit. I knew she was still alive and being digested slowly and painfully and I took pleasure in it. I would tease her while she was still alive and I took pleasure knowing she was in anguish. While the physical pain was delicious it was her mental anguish knowing that what had once been her daughter had eaten her without a second thought and didn't show any sympathy or regret that was so delicious. When I eliminated what remained of her I gave it no more thought than I had the food I had eaten before. I'm a bad girl.&quot; She started crying again.<br />
<br />
Rachael continued to rock her and said, &quot;You're not a bad girl. You didn't eat your mommy. That was Ninjatta.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I was (sniff) Ninjatta,&quot; Amy said through sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ninjatta was a demon that took you over,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;It wasn't you. And now you're free of that demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Amy said quietly. &quot;But now I have no one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have me and my family,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;Now lets get you some clothes then I'll take you to the rest of my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael led her to a bedroom and helped her pick out some clothes. She was surprised that they fit her so well. &quot;These seem to be made for me,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a reason for that,&quot; Rachael said cryptically. &quot;Now Goddess Greta I'll meet you back at the palace. I should be able to open a portal to the room we were in since I know what it looks like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you decided then?&quot; Greta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really have to ask that after hearing Amy's story?&quot; Rachael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see you there then,&quot; Greta said then vanished.<br />
<br />
Rachael grabbed either side of her locket with her fingers and it opened emitting a beam of light for a few feet. At that point it opened a portal which Rachael stepped through with Amy behind her.<br />
<br />
Stepping through a portal was just like stepping through a door from one room to another. There was no sense of the distance between the two points. &quot;Thank Goddess,&quot; a familiar voice said. &quot;I thought another demon was coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked out from behind Rachael and when she saw the woman she shouted, &quot;MOMMY,&quot; and ran to her giving her a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachael, who is this?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Amy,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;She's our daughter in another world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did she get here?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Through the portal the demon came through,&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can't be that demon,&quot; Allison said shocked. &quot;You killed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was the demon and I did kill it,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;My sword kills demons and my ring brings the victim back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Allison said. &quot;Why is she hugging me so tight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's been through a lot,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;I'll tell you later if she doesn't tell you herself. Right now I need to get to the palace.&quot; She knelt down and said, &quot;Rachael, I need to go. I'll be back though. In the meantime get to know your twin sister.&quot; She stood up and kissed Allison. After she said, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Allison said. &quot;Be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael opened a portal and before stepping through looked back and said, &quot;Oh I don't think she's going to let go for some time. When you hear her story you'll understand.&quot; With that she stepped through and the portal closed behind her.<br />
<br />
Amy kept hugging her mommy. On some level she knew that this wasn't the woman who gave birth to her. It didn't matter right now though. She did wonder what Rachael meant by twin sister. When she saw Jessica come into the room though she knew. And she also knew that on this world she had a family again.</p>
