<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny was feeling excited for more than one reason by the time the two guys were there, eager to see if he could detect the transformations that were going on in the two of them since they involved themselves with Sasha. His ex really knew how to pick em. Gabe and Terry would be just the first, though Danny decided he would need to check in later to see what might be going on and if there were any more people who would be changing similarly. Jackson would also be another he&#39;d need to look in on. Well, until then, it was time to get this moving.<br />
<br />
The two guys as soon as they arrived made a bee line right for the pool, and Danny guessed he was not surprised. The heat was pretty astonishing, and the pool his folks had was pretty nice. He&#39;d thought he could tell something was different, but as he watched, the shirts and jeans were taken off, exposing their swimsuits. Danny just decided to hold off on swimming around in there for now, and simply made to work on his tan a little bit while the sun was out.<br />
<br />
He removed his shirt and shorts, standing out there in a tight speedo that he used when he wanted to swim out there and or get his tanning on. Propping himself up on a pool side towel, Danny put on a pair of sunglasses and sat back to watch. He had the perfect position to observe the two guys who&#39;d be changing in his position. Ahh, it was at least a nice day out to get his tanning done. Pity he had to share it with these two dumbasses, but at least he was gonna get a front row seat to the show.<br />
<br />
As Danny watched he swore he saw the two of them starting to get a little bit more keen to engage in horseplay in the pool. Though maybe that was just the fact he&#39;d never been to a pool party with these two idiots. He watched as Terry and Gabe wrestled around in the pool, splashing and laughing whenever they surfaced. Danny tried to get a better look, but the two were a flurry of motion. He couldn&#39;t really tell if anything was unusual about them yet.<br />
<br />
By the time they stopped and went back to just swimming about, Danny did see something seemed at least a little odd physically.<br />
<br />
He did know Gabe well enough to know that the guy was a major hairball. Below the head, Gabe was a mess of hair. Some of the other guys called him Sasquatch due to his hairy appearance and height, but it seemed like the days of Gabe being called that were nearing their end, because Danny was able to see it seemed Gabe&#39;s hair was just about 75% retracted. Thankfully it didn&#39;t all fall out, though, that&#39;d make a hell of a mess in the pool! Terry meanwhile had not been exactly smooth either, and now he was looking almost like he&#39;d waxed before coming over. The only remaining vestiges of body hair were at the middle of his chest and his arms and legs, though reduced somewhat.<br />
<br />
It seemed it was starting slow, and given that he&#39;d directed the change such, he was glad it was. If it came on too fast and overwhelming, it might alert the two of them and make them more suspicious. And Danny wanted to make sure he could watch the majority of their transformations! Maybe it was somewhat perverse, but he did look forward to observing it. As Danny adjusted his position on the poolside, he lightly touched at his groin. Weird again how changing these two seemed to be turning him on. He was gonna need to take care of that...later.<br />
<br />
Danny observed the two some more, and wondered; was Gabe looking a little bit thinner? He wondered about that. Gabe was a big, stocky guy, and it was an open secret that despite the position he had on the football team, Gabe did not exactly like the fatty gut he carried around and the heavier appearance he needed for being a linebacker. Danny started to wonder how the change might affect Gabe&#39;s chances now, while it was not exactly overwhelmingly obvious.<br />
<br />
Terry for his part...Danny swore there was something just slightly off about Terry&#39;s face. Was he slightly prettier than usual? Weird to notice, but it was something. His features seemed a little more noticeable in that regard. Lips a little thicker, facial hair mostly gone, more rounded / effete looks in a few places. How would Terry be able to handle that?<br />
<br />
By the time the two of them got out of the pool, Danny was curious indeed. Terry shouted, &quot;Hey dude, we&#39;re done with the pool, you up for pizza tonight? We&#39;re gonna start calling the girls to come over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pizza sounds awesome!&quot; Danny shouted from his position, and then started to get up and get his clothes together. He looked forward to the women coming over mostly to get himself over Sasha and hopefully find a girl worth his time. But he also looked forward to seeing whether anyone noticed the changes that happened to Terry and Gabe. He also found himself noticing that even after they got themselves cleaned off and dried off, they were just lounging around in their shorts. Would they do that normally...?<br />
<br />
Well, this would be a long night, and Danny looked forward to seeing if anything else happened.</p>
