<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting in the dining room, Amanda looks at her were-panther husband and his parents Anton and Esmeralda.<br />
“Okay,” Amanda speaking; “it’s time to talk about the elephant in the room.” Looking at Anton and Esmeralda; “spill it you two, what is this “deep dark secret you have regarding my husband?”<br />
“Straight to the point I see,” Anton answering.<br />
“Amanda has always been like that dad,” Benton speaking; “what is it I need to know?”<br />
“The bipolar issues are not in the knight family,” Esmeralda speaking; “it’s in my family.”<br />
Amanda chuckles; “coo coo for coco puffs crazy?”<br />
“Don’t be so flippant,” Esmeralda glaring at Amanda; “this is serious. Benton do you remember ever meeting your grandfather. My father?”<br />
“Only vague memories,“ Benton answering; “before my first transformation and all that.”<br />
“Your grandfather was bipolar,” Esmeralda answering; “you never being with him much is because mother did what she could to keep him locked away as best she could. Mom knew he was going feral but couldn’t bear the thought of having to have him sent away.”<br />
Anton holding onto his wife; “its okay, our son needs to know.”<br />
“After you started going off to college,” Esmeralda starting to chock up; “your grandfather managed to escape your grandmother and he had an incident.”<br />
“What kind of incident,” Benton looking concerned.<br />
“Your grandfather attacked a group of young normals on spring break,” Esmeralda shuddering; “he killed them all.”<br />
“What,” Benton shouting; “why was I not told!”<br />
“Because this happened in Florida,” Anton answering; “the Luna brotherhood hunted your grandfather down and had to dispatch him. Apparently he was too far gone for any treatment. With their help and hell of a lot of money, your mother and I was able to get everyone to believe your grandfather was another sighting of the elusive skunk ape; Florida’s version of Bigfoot.”<br />
“Bigfoot,” Amanda snorts; “that just weres getting sloppy with their treks in the woods and letting people take pictures of them.”<br />
Esmeralda ignoring Amanda continues her story; “after your grandfather’s episode, I had a long talk with mom. I made it clear to her that I wanted to know what the hell dad had and why he was never treated for it. Not getting much from mother because she was starting to shows signs of dementia; I ended up having to pour through my family’s medical history. Being were’s such information is not easily to come by. But apparently Bipolar has run rampant in my family for generations.”<br />
“So how does this help me,” Benton is speaking; “why tell me now?”<br />
“Because son,” Anton answering; “you opened the door when you called me those few days ago. Hearing you say you were bipolar, it made me think back to that ugly incident with your grandfather back in Jacksonville. You needed to hear this in person. Not over the phone.”<br />
“Plus,” Esmeralda speaking up; “we wanted to spend time with our granddaughter.”<br />
“Speaking of Frieda,” Anton looking serious; “has she been tested for bipolar disorder?”<br />
“Yes,” Benton answering; “and so has Lance. Both came up negative.”<br />
“Oh thank heavens for that,” Esmeralda sighing;” but you son, how much time do you have before you-“<br />
“Snap,” Benton finishing his mother’s sentence; “go crazy? Need to be put down? Never.” Getting up to grab an assortment of pill bottles and placing them on the table; “as long as I stick to the medication prescribed to me by my doctors, I’ll won’t be like grandpa.”<br />
“And hopefully,” Amanda pursing her lips; “not have another blow up like you did at Tachibana’s.”<br />
“But my doctors did say that Bi-polar tends to skip generations,” Benton sighing; “we won’t know if Frieda’s daughter will be bi-polar or not.”<br />
“Our granddaughter is pregnant,” Esmeralda shouting?<br />
“No,” Benton doing his best to calm his parent down; “Let me explain.”<br />
<br />
Benton goes into detail of how he had several dreams involving him being hunted and killed to being locked in a cell in a ward in the hospital basement. Ending the whole story to watching Frieda give birth to her first child; a daughter and he is holding the child.<br />
“Now I really never put much stock in what most say was prophecy dreams,” Benton speaking; “but after having those dreams and then finding out Frieda, Eric and Spencer had the exact same dream; the birth of their daughters-“<br />
“I just felt a cold chill,” Esmeralda truly spooked by what Benton just said; “Why did you not tell us about this earlier?”<br />
“Like dad said,” Benton answering; “better to hear it in person then over a phone. But I thought you never put much faith in prophecy dreams mom.”<br />
“I never said that,” Esmeralda answering; “I just never…  I never put much faith in premonitions or predictions of the future. I have always been a here and now were-panthress, and I still am.”<br />
“Well these dreams I had,” Benton answering; “gave me three different visions of the future. Not to mention a rather vivid chat with a strange man that looked like Claude Rains telling me to accept whatever diagnosis the doctors are about to give me.”<br />
<br />
Before the conversation can continue; there was an individual pressing the door bell.<br />
“Now who is that at this hour,” Benton getting up and grabbing a robe.<br />
Heading to the front door and about to defur; Benton sees through the peep hole that it is Tachibana No Akane at the door. Opening the door and letting the were-vixen in as Benton was wearing his robe but not cinching it up.<br />
“How are you this evening,” Tachibana speaking.<br />
“As well as can be expected,” Benton answering; “I already heard that Julie has finally been captured and the were-alert has been lifted.”<br />
“That’s not why I’m here,” Tachibana answering; “where is Frieda, Spencer and Eric?”<br />
“Upstairs sleeping,” Amanda answering as she joins her husband at the front entrance; “we heard their rutting and-“<br />
“That’s okay,” Tachibana smiling; “I get the picture. But I have these summons for them.” Tachibana producing scrolls from her large overcoat; “they need to be at the council building tomorrow for the conclusion of Julie’s proceedings.”<br />
“So they get no school again,” Benton sighing; “is it bright and early like before?”<br />
“Unfortunately yes,” Tachibana answering; “so most council member will be their usual grumpy caffeine deprived selves.”<br />
“I’ll make sure the cubs get these then,” Benton placing the scrolls in his paws; “anything else?”<br />
“Tell Tachibana I’ll talk with her tomorrow son,” Anton shouting; “your mother and I are going to have a little fun with a romp in the woods right now.”<br />
“I heard you Anton,” Tachibana chuckling; “It’s nice to see the sand and sun hasn’t changed you from your usual randy self. But you might want to wait until Saturday. Council is likely to last all day like today did.”<br />
“That bad then huh,” Anton laughing; “glad I dropped it all for more time with my wife then.”<br />
“Alright you two,” Benton looking embarrassed; “go have your romp, with luck Amanda and I will have a quiet moment to ourselves.”<br />
<br />
It was at that moment that everyone at the front entrance twitched their ears to the sounds coming from upstairs. Eric, Spencer and Frieda were awake and rutting yet again.<br />
“Quiet night indeed,” Anton laughing as he and Esmeralda walk to the kitchen entrance for their night time fun.<br />
“I’ll leave you two alone then,” Tachibana grinning through her vulpine maw.<br />
<br />
Benton and Amanda sigh as they watch Tachibana leave and they listen to Eric Spencer and their daughter Frieda shout, scream and yowl in joy as they continue their own night’s pleasure.<br />
“You know we are going to have to get use to that,” Benton speaking as they head to the kitchen for some coffee;” especially if it makes Frieda happy.”<br />
“Yeah,” Amanda looking resigned; “you know when I checked on them, seeing the three sleeping peacefully and purring so loud; it made me smile as I longed for those days of us going at it all night.”<br />
“You do remember what Tachibana said earlier,” Benton smiling; “that the scents of those three mixing and mingling during sex, acts like an aphrodisiac to all other weres.”<br />
“What are you trying to say Benton,” Amanda looking at her husband coyly.<br />
“That I’m not sure I’ll be able to keep my paws off you tonight,” Benton growling; “and I can tell you have that same look in your eyes.”<br />
“You know,” Amanda sauntering up to Benton and placing a paw on his large furry chest; “your parents are probably rutting in the woods right now. I wouldn’t be surprised if they spend the night sleeping under a tree.”<br />
“Let them,” Benton inhaling his wife’s aroused scent; “we have our own love nest to couple in.” Guiding his wife upstairs; Benton has a big smile on his face and a deep throaty purr as Amanda clearly aroused and eager for him. Ignoring the loud rutting sounds coming from Frieda’s room; Amanda and Benton hurry to their own bedroom and begin their own night’s passion.</p>
