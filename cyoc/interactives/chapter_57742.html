<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>It wasn't long before we were at the home. It did look like a big house that could 
hold about three families of four. I had to wonder how many orphans were housed 
here. We would soon find out as we got out of the van and were led up to the house. 
Once we were inside Mrs. Bailey introduced us to the other girls and none had been 
transformed though I didn't know if any were from our world. There were four of them; 
Crystal Poore who was six, Janet Hopkins who was eight, Denise Richards who was 
twelve, and Gabriella Gunn who was fourteen. With us that made a total of eight girls 
in the home which had space for sixteen girls. There was one major rule in the house, 
no boys in the bedroom or bathroom. The others were to be respectful, do your chores 
and homework, and no fighting.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bailey took us around showing us the dining room, the rec room, the 
playground, the bathroom, and finally the bedroom. The bathroom had eight showers, 
four toilets, and four sinks. While the showers weren't private the toilets were in stalls. 
The bedroom was pretty much one big room with bunk beds along the walls, eight to a 
side. There was a walk-in closet at the end with room for some of our clothes should 
we decide to hang some up. "Well choose your beds girls," Mrs. Bailey told us. "The 
four empty bottom bunks please. Also later we'll see if you need to go to school over 
the summer. I hear that Gregorskie's School for Girls of All Ages has a pretty good 
summer program. Maybe we'll send you there if you need summer school which I think 
you will. Lunch will be in about two hours. There will be a bell to tell you that it's time 
so when you hear it come to the dining room." With that she left us alone.</p>
<p>Dike sighed and said, "If only my ring could grant wishes. Then I could wish us 
home."</p>
<p>I smiled as I put my pack next to the bed I picked out which also had a window by 
it and said, "Well if it did I doubt if it would be able to... get... us... back." I slowed up 
as I thought of something that could mean trouble.</p>
<p>The others must have picked up on my hesitancy since Nausikka asked, "What is 
it?"</p>
<p>I turned to Nausikka and asked, "Do you remember one story called <i>It began 
when I made her clothes disappear</i>?"</p>
<p>"I remember that," Nausikka said nodding her head. "I read quite a bit of it. I 
stopped reading the branch where they were becoming she-males since I'm not 
interested in them. Why?"</p>
<p>"Well then you probably didn't get to the part that could be trouble," I said looking 
down. "I'm such an idiot for not seeing it when we were with Father."</p>
<p>"Well what is it?" Dike asked with a little impatience in her voice.</p>
<p>"Ok at one point in the story the she-males' power to transform others into she-
males was becoming weak," I said and looked at Nausikka. I could tell that she didn't 
know what I was talking about so I continued, "Well the old woman that gave the 
character the ring at the beginning was Salmacis who had merged with 
Hermaphroditus so they became a she-male. I suppose you should say it was 
Hermaphroditus but that's splitting hairs. Anyway she knew that the she-males' power 
was weakening as more people were transformed so she went to Olympus to get the 
Ring of the Gods. This ring was designed to boost the gods power should they need 
it."</p>
<p>"So why would it be trouble?" Nausikka asked then suddenly got a look of 
comprehension on her face as it dawned on her. "But Father said nothing was 
stolen."</p>
<p>"Correction," I said holding up a finger, "Father didn't say if something was stolen 
or not. He only mentioned the message and the dead mortal." Seeing the blank looks 
on Dike and Semele's faces I continued, "This means that someone could have stolen 
the Ring of the Gods and would explain why Father looked so worried. If someone did 
and tried to boost their power with it then there's no telling what the results would be if 
it was an unknown power."</p>
<p>As if to make my point the temperature suddenly dropped to below freezing and it 
started to snow outside. We all started shivering and Semele said, "Nice going." Well I 
guess it could be seen as my fault since it happened right after I said there was no 
telling what the results would be.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bailey came in and said, "Come down to the rec room girls. We'll have a fire 
going in the fireplace shortly, hot chocolate for you to drink, and blankets for you to 
wrap yourselves in until we get the gas turned back on." She left and we quickly put 
on our winter wear which we were glad we had. Once we were somewhat warmer we 
went down and joined the others in the rec room.</p>
<p>Hours later I was dressed in my pajamas and looking out the window. Everyone 
else was asleep but I couldn't get to sleep quite yet. I kept thinking about how my 
sisters were happy about the possibility of going back once we found the Ring of the 
Gods. They had chatted excitedly about it when we were once again alone and 
Nausikka and Dike thought they would be turned back into boys. I didn't share in their 
enthusiasm and when they asked me what was wrong I told them that I didn't want to 
become a guy again. They seemed to buy that and didn't pursue it any further. While I 
didn't want to become a guy again that wasn't why I wasn't excited. If we found the 
Ring of the Gods and it is the reason we were here then I was afraid that the power 
contained in it might have been badly damaged and that we might have to destroy it to 
prevent it from ripping multiple worlds to pieces. That would mean that more than likely 
everyone who had been drawn in would be stuck here for eternity. It may not be so 
bad for some of us but others would probably go crazy. Also I don't know if Father 
could bring our families into this world. I could only see one slim hope. For me and my 
sisters we were now of both worlds so we may be able to go back and forth at will. 
This could be the key to getting the others back before we had to destroy the ring but 
then it might kill whoever used it. I looked at my sisters and sighed. I should tell them 
about what I think may happen though I don't want to crush their hope. I slipped into 
my bed thinking that we needed some more information about what power we were 
dealing with. Maybe we could find the answer in a library full of books on magic. With 
this thought I slipped off into dreamland.</p></p>
