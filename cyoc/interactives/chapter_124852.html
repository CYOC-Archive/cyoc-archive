<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt looked up at the departure board and saw that the flight to Dublin that his ticket was for was due to leave in ten minutes! He ran as fast as he could to the gate, and was greeted by a suspiciously cheery flight attendant.<br />
<br />
‘Ah, so you’ll be... Matt? Just in time. We’re very busy today, so you’ll be in seat 3A, first class.’<br />
<br />
Matt decided to ignore the fact that she somehow knew his name, he was just pleased that he got this free upgrade. He got onto the plane and sat in his very luxurious looking window seat, and lied down to try and get some sleep during the long flight.<br />
<br />
He was woken up by the flight attendant from earlier shaking his shoulder gently, who smiled and handed him a generous glass of whiskey and a very thick wallet.<br />
<br />
‘We’ll be landing in just a few minutes, so here’s your complementary drink and spending money. Thank you for flying with us today, sir.’<br />
<br />
Matt opened the wallet as he took a sip of his whiskey to find thousands of Euros in cash! He tucked it into his pocket, grinning to himself, and took another gulp of the oddly salty beverage, not realising that he’d already downed it.<br />
<br />
Matt walked out of the airport and hailed a taxi, and asked the driver to take him to the city centre. When he stepped in, the driver said to him, ‘Sure thing, welcome home by the way.’ He was confused by this for a second, but then he remembered that this is his home, he’s lived in Ireland his whole life! Matt thought about this in confusion for the rest of the journey, but was interrupted by the driver shouting back at him, ‘Alright, here we are. That’ll be twenty Euro.’ Matt handed him the money, and stumbled out of the taxi right into a pub.<br />
<br />
As he walked in, he was almost deafened by the cheering and clinking of glasses. A man got up and came over to Matt from a group of five, all wearing rugby shirts and shouting loudly at the rugby game on the TV.<br />
<br />
‘Hey, come join us! The craic’s grand! I’m Sean by the way.’<br />
<br />
Dazed, Matt stumbled over to the table and the lads shuffled along to make room for him as he collapsed onto the bench. Sean shouted over to the bartender for a pint of Guinness, which he promptly handed over to Matt.<br />
<br />
‘Go on mate, have some.’<br />
<br />
Matt raised the glass to his lips and took a sip, which became a gulp, which became a chug. Before he knew it he was on his second glass, and the group around him was cheering him on. The man next to him pulled off Matt’s t-shirt, and replaced it with a green rugby shirt which was far too big for Matt. Sean shouted to the group, ‘He’s turning into a proper Irish lad now, so!’<br />
<br />
As he said this, Matt felt the alcohol going down his throat sting a little, and create a mild tingle across his whole body. He felt the prickling of stubble coming in, and looked in a mirror beside to find that not only did he have a 5 o’clock shadow, his hair had turned ginger! His facial features shifted around a bit, giving him a handsome typically Irish face with a scattering of freckles.<br />
<br />
Matt groaned as his shoulders widened and his spine creaked up, growing him to a solid six foot. Focussed on the rugby game, the rest of the group seemed not to notice his pecs expand, stretching out his shirt. Matt quietly moaned as his now sensitive nipples rubbed against the smooth material, causing his cock to slowly become erect. His biceps bulged out, prompting Matt to flex his arm, showing how firm and meaty they now were. He felt his abdomen tighten, and lifted up his shirt to reveal an impressive set of six-pack abs. As he rubbed his hands up and down them, he noticed his fingers become thick and his hand expand outwards, and become rough and calloused.<br />
<br />
Matt felt his thighs start to grow, and so looked down and realised that his jeans had somehow become rugby shorts, which had become tight around his expanded thighs. His thighs and calves became nice and firm, but his attention was quickly drawn to his groin.<br />
<br />
Seeing as everyone else seemed to be distracted, he pulled out his cock and started jacking off. As he stroked it, it slowly started to lengthen and become thicker, and even regrow its foreskin. Matt moaned loudly, and suddenly came all over himself. He swallowed some of this, and felt dizzy for a second.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t Matt anymore, he was Aidan. He stood up, towering over the group, and shouted in his new musical accent, ‘Right lads, let’s get out of here, I’m pissed.’</p>
