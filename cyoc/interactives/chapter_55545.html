<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kathy didn't know why she felt the need to check up on her family tree. Maybe the incident <br />
with the Game turning her into a mouth-piece puppet to mutate her family and everybody <br />
nearby had left her curious about that period in history. <br />
<br />
Sadly all the archives about such things were in Glendale, and after the horror of Kurse, <br />
Kathy felt even less eager to return to that cursed town. <br />
<br />
This left Kathy with some faded family albums, the words of her grandparents (her <br />
mother's, father's, and step-father's),  and a 'sweet dreams' fairy figurine goodluck charm <br />
that had been in the family for generations accord to her real father.  <br />
<br />
The half-dragon twins (born after her mother had remarried) were of course scared stiff by <br />
what happened, but had quickly recovered and now wanted to know all they could about <br />
the game (likely fantasizing using it to becoming full dragons, or super heroes, or ninjas, <br />
or pirates). <br />
<br />
Glendale had been under the effects of a plague at the time, so records however dealt <br />
mostly with that rather than the so-called myth of witchcraft. <br />
<br />
Finding a family tree in the attic with yellowing paper, Kathy found that her family had <br />
come across the atlantic around the year 1800, and had split up settling in Salem, <br />
Frostvile, and Glendale. Of course Kathy knew that already, her family had relocated here <br />
because they were fellow Felman here. <br />
<br />
Kathy was glade the curse at least hadn't turned her into a leoman, or a gargoyle, or a <br />
lupman.... all their fur colors were so drab, so faded, so dark, so bland. Kathy's <br />
grandparent had said they had to be logically related to the Wolf Pack, since those <br />
wonderful bright colors in the lupmans' fur had to come from somewhere. <br />
<br />
Kathy remembered somewhere that the Indian word for vegetarian was 'bad hunter', she <br />
didn't know if it was true or not, but had been a joke among the other hunting species <br />
eons ago that felman were pathetic hunters since they had all the sublimity and stealth of a <br />
marching band due to fur color that you'd also see on poison arrow frogs. <br />
<br />
Some even figured that felman had survived BECAUSE their bright fur colors made them <br />
resemble poisonous creatures, like supposedly some species of butterflies had wing <br />
patterns that imitated more poisonous species of insect. <br />
<br />
While leomans might have invented civilization, humans and felmans were the first to pick <br />
up on it, lupmans and dragons stubbornly rejecting it for half of recorded history of the <br />
species' of man. <br />
<br />
Kathy found what she already knew, that her tattoos (and those of her brothers, mother, <br />
father and one set of grandparents) were ancestral and were supposed to contain bits of <br />
her family history if she knew how to read them. Apparently it was a trait felman in Africa <br />
had picked up from the local leoman, which had since mostly fallen out of style. <br />
<br />
Apparently some felman had been brought over as 'discount' slaves from Africa, brought <br />
over purely as an afterthought since they couldn't fit humans into the space they had left. <br />
This had been in the 1820s. <br />
<br />
'At least that explains where the half-naked members of my family came from.' Kathy <br />
thought. <br />
<br />
However, for leomans, only the matriarch of the Pride was tattooed anymore. And the only <br />
felman besides Kathy and her relatives who still practiced it were some fundamentalist <br />
pockets in Africa, and a the first born of families in Asia... There were some teenage <br />
felmans in Japan who still apparently ancestral tattooed themselves. But their style was <br />
considered a total bastardization and generalization of the tradition and style even by <br />
those who didn't practice the ritual tattooing. <br />
<br />
Kathy couldn't find anything with her limit research material on WHY her forefathers had <br />
come across the ocean. She figured it must have been opportunity, or good old fashioned <br />
curiosity (though Kathy cringed at the stereotype). <br />
<br />
 Kathy also figured it might have been the traditional fear of oblivion, and wanting to <br />
spread their seed as far as possible least another plague hit Europe. After all, even today, <br />
there were only sixty million felman in the world.... one percent of the entire world's <br />
population. Dragons numbers were even smaller. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope my letter gets to that boy... he was a real hero for someone who wasn't gifted to be <br />
born a felman... Well, it's not like I'm going to get a response in a day.... &quot; Kathy wasn't <br />
about to let it consume her ever waking thought however, and thought instead of the <br />
modeling agency that had offered to hire her as soon as she graduated. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The nine cubs took one look at him as her shadow fell across them.  The purple lupman <br />
boy struggled under the loving weight but only look somewhat desperate to escape rather. <br />
<br />
They didn't respond all at once like Gillie thought they would knowing what she did about <br />
their origin. Their expressions weren't all the same either. Four had Elise's fur color, with <br />
four others were the dirty orange of Fox's. The ninth of course was Mary, reddish gold, like <br />
her father. <br />
<br />
Gillie crushed herself, she was a police officer, she was supposed to be observant. She she <br />
had seen Brian Hardy was also experiencing loss, but it hadn't registered since she was <br />
distracted by their badges they now had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chief?&quot; One of the black furred cubs asked looking surprised and seemed to have better <br />
maintain fur than the other. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't you be at work?&quot;<br />
<br />
The forth one said nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think mom and dad will be able to come onto work for a while.&quot; Mary said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chief?&quot; Said the purple teenage wolf. <br />
<br />
'Chief of Glendale police.&quot; Said one of dirty orange ones. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! I! Am I in trouble?&quot; The purple lad asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;.... No... you're not... I just came here to find the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Another of the dirty orange ones. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever it is I didn't do it.&quot; Said another dirty orange one with slightly more wild fur than <br />
the rest. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not in trouble.&quot; Said Gillie firmly. <br />
<br />
The wild furred seemed relieved at that. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... just came here to see how you were all doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The eight girls all suddenly looked sad. And Gillie remembered what Amy said about these <br />
were supposed to be now Elise and Fox's children... <br />
<br />
'But they're supposed to be just Elise and Fox cut into four pieces dammit! They should be <br />
the ones acting alike, thinking alike, looking -exactly- the alike... Not Frank, Julie and <br />
Daryl!' <br />
<br />
The copper colored lioness wondered what she was even doing here.</p>
