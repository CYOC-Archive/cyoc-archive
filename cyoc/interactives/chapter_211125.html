<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim needed to do something quickly. He could hear the pneumatic chuff coming from ahead. As he stood there contemplating what he could do to escape this fate the dark thought came to him that he was just a raw commodity now. Humanity saw him as a thing that had to be harvested and processed into meat. It was now an inconvenience to them that he needed to be bled, cut open, bits of him removed before he could be eaten and ingested by humans.<br />
<br />
He should of been laying more attention to his surroundings. A man in a plastic apron shouted &quot;too slow!&quot; and proceeded to insert a metal probe into Tim&#39;s anus. Instantly his back arched and his legs, both fore and rear spread open. His head lowered involuntarily as another man wrapped a rope around his horns and head. &quot;should of been quicker shouldnt you!&quot; snarled the man as he spit on Tim.<br />
<br />
All time could do was moo loadly back. &quot;Fucking cow. I&#39;ll see you... Or a bit of you in my cheeseburger tomorrow. Enjoy your death!&quot; spat the man.<br />
<br />
The rope around Tim&#39;s head was attached to a pulley/conveyor system above his head, and the anal probe was roughly removed. Tim got his movement back but found the give on the rope was lacking. The conveyor dragged him along towards his doom.<br />
<br />
Ahead he saw a group of men talking, as he was dragged closer he caught a few words of the conversation. &quot;so we need to try this method on a new one&quot;. The bull ahead of Tim went into a cage. &quot;so you don&#39;t stun them?&quot; the door slid down behind the big bull. &quot;no you just use this on the neck, and it makes them completely immobile, but keeps the heart going&quot;. BANG. The bull dropped to the floor and rolled out of sight - to be turned Into burgers. &quot;Here, let&#39;s try it on this cow&quot; they turned and one of the men pointed at Tim. Tim was dragged into the box and the door slid closed behind him. Another man was moving a device towards his head when a colleague stopped him. &quot;try this on that one&quot;. The stunner grinned. &quot;with pleasure&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim struggled but between the rope holding his head and the door behind him, he couldn&#39;t escape. The stunner placed a strange device Tim had never seen before over his neck, and pushed a button. At once he heard a drill and felt the drill going into his neck. Timlost all feeling from behind his neck. His mouth lolled open and his eyes went out of focus. But he could still see. And he was still conscious. And he was still a cow, who had just beened stunned in a slaughterhouse. He was beside himself with fear. All the way here in the truck Tim had assumed and taken a small comfort from the fact that the moment he was stunned, his life would be over if he wasn&#39;t somehow saved before hand.<br />
<br />
The side of the cage opened and Tim rolled out, just as the bull had done before him. That very same bull was now hanging upside down about 5 ft away, blood pouring out of his neck, his front legs removed and his penis and scrotum currently being cut out of his body.<br />
<br />
A man came up to Tim and touched his open eyeball. &quot;see, completely unconscious. Ready to be processed.&quot;<br />
A chain was looped around Tim&#39;s left rear leg and attached to a hoist, which began to lift Tim up. He had lost most of his feelings but still could feel something. Almost like when he had been numbed at the dentist by injection and could still feel very basic movement.<br />
<br />
As Tim rose higher, his pelvis cracked in two as his bulky form moved into an unnatural shape. <br />
<br />
A man came into Tim&#39;s view who plunged a knife into Tim&#39;s neck and at once a torrent of red blood began to fall out of his neck.<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, he got carried on to another station where a man held a large machine shaped like a pair of scissors. He placed them around Tim&#39;s forelegs just above the knee and the scissors efficiently snapped Tim&#39;s forelegs off<br />
<br />
Tim screamed inside but his body made no noise. If he could cry he would have.<br />
<br />
The journey continued, as the blood continued to pour from his legs and neck. He was whizzed into the clasp of another man with another scissor machine who proceeded to cut off the leg Tim was not being suspended by. A hook was then inserted into the stump of his leg that remained and hoisted tim onto that, the leg with the chain was then cut off and the chain removed. Another hook inserted into that leg and off tim went down the rail spread eagled.<br />
<br />
The blood flow began to lessen and Tim&#39;s vision of the world began to darken. He barely noticed a whizzing of a saw into the back of his neck which cut off his head. A worker catching him by the horns and tossing him into a container nearby where he landed next to the bull he had followed into the slaughterhouse. The last Tim saw of his body was as it was deskinned and sawn into two pieces before it whizzed out of view to be further processes into prime cuts of beef and steak.<br />
<br />
As Tim lay there on top of his former cow friends he wondered how things would of turned out had it not been for that bloody watch!</p>
