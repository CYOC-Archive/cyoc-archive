<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack felt awkward, his new body heavy and foreign. Sitting on his parents&#39; bed, he hugged his arms around his mother&#39;s large breasts, hoping to stop their constant jiggling every time he moved. He glanced down at himself—at *her*—and then back at Maddie, who stood in his own body, grinning in a way that was unsettling on Zack&#39;s familiar face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I *need* my body back!&quot; Zack pleaded, his mother&#39;s soft voice making the words sound desperate and whiny. &quot;This isn&#39;t right! I don’t even know how your powers work. I don’t want to be in your body any longer than I have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie laughed, brushing a hand through Zack’s wavy brown hair, her every movement unsettlingly confident for someone who had never been in his body before. She sauntered toward the closet, opened it, and pulled out a simple but elegant yellow summer dress. She held it up against Zack&#39;s—*her own*—voluptuous frame and tilted her head thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sweetie,&quot; she said dismissively, as if Zack were merely overreacting to a bad haircut. &quot;You need to stop worrying so much! It’s *fine*. It’s not like this is permanent. At least, I don’t think it is.&quot; She winked at him. &quot;Plus, don’t you think it’s fun to experience something new? I mean, look at you! You’re me! And I have to admit...&quot; She glanced at herself in the mirror, flexing Zack’s toned arms and running a hand over his tight abs. &quot;...Being you feels *amazing*! So much energy and stamina—no shoulder or back pain, either. Honestly, Zack, I think I might keep this body for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Zack shot to his feet, momentarily forgetting he was wearing nothing but his mother&#39;s bare skin. He froze, feeling the heavy sway of her body, and quickly grabbed the blanket from the bed to cover himself. &quot;You can’t just *keep* my body! I didn’t even want you in it in the first place!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie ignored his protests, walking over to him with the yellow dress and a matching set of plain white bra and panties. &quot;Here, let’s get you dressed. You can’t go around naked all day—you’re me now, and I have standards.&quot; She winked, making Zack’s stomach churn.<br />
<br />
Zack’s protests turned into stammering when Maddie held the panties out for him. &quot;No, no way! I’m not wearing *that*! I’m not wearing any of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie sighed, giving him the kind of stern mom-look he had grown up with. &quot;Zack, we’re not arguing about this. You’re going to put these on. What if someone comes over? Or worse—what if you have to leave the house? You can’t just walk around naked.&quot; She smirked and leaned in closer. &quot;Besides, sweetie, you’re *me*. You’ll look ridiculous if you wear anything but my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack’s cheeks burned with humiliation, but he reluctantly accepted the panties and bra. &quot;This is so messed up,&quot; he muttered as he clumsily stepped into the underwear, struggling to pull them up over his mother’s wide hips. The bra was even worse—his hands were shaking as he tried to clasp it behind his back, and the unfamiliar weight of his mom’s heavy breasts made him feel completely off balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me help,&quot; Maddie offered cheerfully, stepping forward and expertly fastening the bra. &quot;There we go! Now for the dress.&quot; She held it up for Zack to step into, and despite his protests, he complied, slipping the soft fabric over his new curves. Maddie zipped it up in the back and adjusted the straps on his shoulders. &quot;Perfect! You look lovely, sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack stared at his reflection in the mirror, horrified. His mother’s body looked perfectly at home in the yellow dress, but the expression on her face—his face—was one of pure despair. &quot;This is humiliating,&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don’t be so dramatic,&quot; Maddie said, grabbing a pair of white sandals from the closet and handing them to him. &quot;Now put these on. Trust me, you’ll feel better once you’re fully dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack reluctantly slid the sandals onto his feet, glaring at Maddie the entire time. &quot;There. Happy now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very,&quot; Maddie replied with a wide grin. &quot;Now, let’s talk about what happens next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens next is that you figure out how to swap us back,&quot; Zack snapped, crossing his arms—an action that only made his chest stick out more, much to his embarrassment. &quot;I don’t want to be you, Mom! And I definitely don’t want to stay like this while you’re running around in my body, doing...who knows what!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don’t be so boring,&quot; Maddie said, waving a dismissive hand. &quot;You’ve already awakened your powers, so this is the perfect opportunity for you to practice! You’ve seen how Molly and I use ours—it’s all about focus and intent. If you concentrate, I’m sure you can figure out how to swap back or jump into someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack frowned, suspicious. &quot;Why would I want to jump into someone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Maddie could answer, the bedroom door burst open, and Molly stood in the doorway, completely naked as usual. &quot;Whoa!&quot; she exclaimed, her eyes lighting up with excitement. &quot;Zack! You look *just* like Mom! That’s so cool!&quot; She clapped her hands together and grinned mischievously. &quot;Hey, let me try jumping into you now! I bet I can do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? NO!&quot; Zack shouted, backing away, his arms outstretched defensively. &quot;Stay away from me, Molly!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Molly’s grin only widened. &quot;Aw, come on, Zack! It’ll be fun!&quot; She closed her eyes and tilted her head, the familiar shimmer of her power radiating from her small frame as she prepared to leap into him.<br />
<br />
Zack panicked, his mind racing. He didn’t know how his powers worked, but he knew he couldn’t let Molly take over. He closed his eyes, trying to concentrate the way his mom had told him, and suddenly, he felt a surge of energy deep inside his chest. It was instinctive—a raw, defensive burst that felt like a wall slamming into place.<br />
<br />
When Zack opened his eyes, Molly was lying on the floor, staring up at him in shock. &quot;Wha—?&quot; she stammered. &quot;How did you do that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don’t know,&quot; Zack admitted, breathing heavily. But a part of him felt strangely proud—he had stopped her. For the first time in his life, he had actually stopped Molly from taking over.<br />
<br />
Maddie clapped her hands, looking delighted. &quot;Well done, sweetie! It looks like you’re learning how to use your powers after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don’t even know what I did!&quot; Zack protested, still trembling.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s okay,&quot; Maddie said with a shrug. &quot;The important thing is that you did it. Now, you just need to practice. Speaking of which...&quot; She turned to the door, a mischievous glint in her eyes. &quot;I’d better get going. School’s about to start, and I wouldn’t want to be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, WHAT?!&quot; Zack shouted, his voice shrill with panic. &quot;You can’t go to school in my body!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can,&quot; Maddie replied cheerfully. &quot;You’ve been acting so strange all week—if you skip now, people will really start asking questions. Don’t worry, sweetie. I’ll behave.&quot; She winked at him and turned to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Don’t you dare—&quot; Zack tried to follow her, but Molly suddenly grabbed his arm, still grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Zack,&quot; she said, tilting her head. &quot;If you can stop me from jumping into you, does that mean you can jump into *me*?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack froze, torn between horror and curiosity. He looked at Molly, then at Maddie, who was already halfway out the door, humming to herself.<br />
<br />
This was going to be a long day.</p>
