<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa and Ty both got undressed. Lisa said, &quot;Some of the things we&#39;ve tried recently have been amazing. You being just a giant cock inside me, stretching my whole body. You fucking my pussy from inside me. My being inside your cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded. &quot;You&#39;ve had some excellent ideas, and I&#39;ve loved every moment of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But now I want to take it even further,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Further how?&quot; he asked, puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to try BEING your cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sure,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t sound convinced that you want to do it,&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I&#39;m willing to try it. I&#39;m just trying to imagine it. If you were my cock, I suppose you&#39;d want me to masturbate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally,&quot; Lisa replied. &quot;That would be what I exist for. To give you sexual pleasure. And to experience it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought about it. &quot;So for me, it, I mean you, would just be my normal cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I&#39;d want to be your very large cock. Or whatever size cock you think will make you the happiest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So would we be able to communicate somehow?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn&#39;t expected this to turn into twenty questions,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I guess I hadn&#39;t thought it through in all that much detail. But I suppose I just meant that I&#39;d basically be your large but otherwise normal cock. So no communicating, other than what men and their cocks normally do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; said Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you&#39;re not enthused,&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s just that in most of our transformations, we both got to experience something new and different. But for me, this will just be normal masturbation. I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, I like jacking off as much as any guy. But I like fucking you much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, you say the sweetest things to a girl!&quot; she joked. &quot;So it doesn&#39;t excite you to think that as you&#39;re jacking off, that I literally AM your cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when you put it like that, I guess it does sound kinda hot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Once you do that for me, we can trade. You can try being my pussy. Or, for that matter, you can be my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal!&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you waiting for?&quot; She grabbed his cock with both hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s not how it&#39;s done,&quot; he said, pushing her down on the bed, and spreading her legs. &quot;Try this.&quot; He shoved his cock into her. Instead of thrusting back and forth, he grabbed her breasts.<br />
<br />
Lisa felt his hands becoming bigger, more easily holding her whole breasts. And his cock was growing, too, stretching her vagina. But then she thought no, he wasn&#39;t getting larger. Well, maybe his cock was. But she was shrinking. And not just shrinking! She started to feel herself being absorbed into him. It felt wonderful, though in a quite unusual way. She&#39;d never felt anything like it before.<br />
<br />
She realized that Ty was now holding her entire body in one hand. Her body was almost as small as when she&#39;d emerged from his cock earlier in the day, and she was still shrinking. No, she thought. She was no longer shrinking. But she was still being absorbed into him. She felt her head, arms, and legs merge into her torso, and then her breasts, as her torso was merging into his cock. The last of her torso to go was her pussy wrapped around his shaft, and she felt an odd regret as it started to give up its separate existence. Her clit was the very last part of her body to merge into him, and with a little sorrow she felt it yield.<br />
<br />
She was now entirely his cock. She had no sight, no hearing, no motor control. She could only feel her new form, so much simpler than the complicated human body she recently had. This was so much easier than being human, she thought. No cares other than to provide pleasure for her owner, and to experience that pleasure as well.<br />
<br />
She felt a hand wrapped around her shaft, and it felt absolutely wonderful. The hand started stroking up and down, spreading the pleasure through her. She realized that she was growing a bit, and becoming much firmer. Her head was SO sensitive. This felt infinitely better than that useless human head she had before. That head had wasted almost all of its time thinking and talking and eating and breathing, which were not anywhere near as nice as this. She hoped her owner was enjoying this as much as she was. She knew that this transform was the one she&#39;d been wanting, the platonic ideal. There was no need to try any other form after this. Perfection and total enlightenment had been achieved. He was in nirvana.<br />
<br />
And not just any old nirvana, no! This nirvana just kept getting better. He was being stroked faster and harder. He feared that if things got any more intense, it would become painful, but it did not. His pleasure just continued to increase, along with the speed and force of the stimulation. <br />
<br />
And then, just as he believed he could never feel more pleasure, suddenly he did! It was unbelievable. It came in bursts, and with each burst, he felt a mass of hot liquid erupt through him, as his whole self pulsed again and again. The first few bursts were the best, but they started tapering off. The pleasure was tapering off. Well, not tapering off, he realized, but transitioning to a different form of pleasure. Less of an urgent, needy pleasure, and more of a luxuriant pleasure. He felt  himself becoming less firm, and shrinking, but it was fine because the new, more languorous pleasure was so relaxing and soothing. He felt comfortable, warm, and sleepy. He never wanted anything to change.<br />
<br />
He regained consciousness later to a startling sensation. The languorous pleasure had gone away, and although he couldn&#39;t identify it, he felt something pulling at him. It was very odd. It wasn&#39;t something tugging on his shaft or head. It was a tugging on his mind. Did he have a mind? The idea seemed strange to him. Even having an idea seemed strange. Somehow the tugging seemed to be pulling his mind out of the comfortable environment of his shaft and head. What was going on? Why was he being subjected to this horrible feeling? Why was not he just being used again, in his job as a conduit for pleasure?<br />
<br />
I won&#39;t have it, he thought! He started pulling back against the force. I&#39;m staying right here, and nothing is going to change that. It was very difficult to fight the pulling, though. He had to really concentrate, which was a new experience for him. He had the odd feeling that somehow, in the past, he had concentrated on things. He had had thoughts, other than just pleasure. How could that be? He didn&#39;t want anything but pleasure. Why had there ever been anything else? Why couldn&#39;t he just have more of it? What was his owner doing to him?<br />
<br />
His owner. Why was he thinking of his owner? He shouldn&#39;t even have to. His owner should be doing all the thinking. That was owner&#39;s job, not his! Owner wasn&#39;t... wasn&#39;t... right. Something was wrong with owner!<br />
<br />
Another strange sensation came over him. This can&#39;t be right, he thought. I&#39;m not even supposed to be thinking, and now I am... hearing? What is hearing? I&#39;m not having it. I just want my job as a cock. Owner does the thinking. And &quot;hearing&quot;, whatever that is. He resisted the pulling and this new &quot;hearing&quot;, with every fiber of his being.<br />
<br />
Whew, he thought. I have defeating the &quot;hearing&quot;. Now if the dreadful pulling would just stop! But it didn&#39;t. If anything, it increased. And the &quot;hearing&quot; came back. Now it was words. Words? What the hell are words? Why am I having to think about words?<br />
<br />
The words started coming together. They even started to make a tiny amount of sense, if you could call it that. He didn&#39;t want to think about the words, but they were so insistent. And once he started making sense of them, it just kept getting worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa! Lisa, stop fighting me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa? Who is Lisa? Why is someone pestering him about Lisa? Someone else can deal with Lisa, leave me the fuck alone!<br />
<br />
But the voice wouldn&#39;t leave him alone, and now he was getting quite angry. He wanted to reply, to shout, but he didn&#39;t know how. A cock doesn&#39;t know. A cock doesn&#39;t have to talk, to shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa! It&#39;s Ty! You have to let me transform you back!&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit of doubt entered his mind. That was novel. He had never experienced doubt. He was pretty sure this was another thing cocks didn&#39;t do, didn&#39;t need to deal with. And &quot;Ty&quot;? Should that name mean something to him? Why should any name matter to a cock?<br />
<br />
Now that he thought about it, &quot;Ty&quot; did sound familiar somehow. And maybe &quot;Lisa&quot; did too. But why wouldn&#39;t the voice just let him sleep? Why didn&#39;t owner either jack him off again, or leave him be? Owner should deal with this Lisa person. And Ty.<br />
<br />
Another thought entered his mind. Ty? Owner was Ty, right? Somehow he knew that, even though he also knew that it wasn&#39;t a cock&#39;s job to know names, to know people.<br />
<br />
People? What were people? Why was he having all these thoughts? It hurt his brain! See, there it goes again. Brain and brain, what is brain?<br />
<br />
If Ty was owner, why was owner yelling at him? Owner didn&#39;t talk to Cock. Owner jacked off, or fucked, or pissed, or let Cock sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa, please! This is Ty! I love you! Let me bring you back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Love. What the hell was love? Cocks knew fucking. And pissing. And not love. Again, that was owner&#39;s job. Ty&#39;s job. That&#39;s right, Ty was owner. If Ty was talking to Cock, something was very wrong. Something was... fucked up.<br />
<br />
What a strange expression, &quot;fucked up&quot;. Fucking was good. Cock knew that. Everyone knew that. (Who was &quot;everyone&quot;?) Yet &quot;fucked up&quot; was bad. Cock knew that, but wan&#39;t sure how. Nothing made sense any more. But if owner was trying to talk to Cock, things were definitely fucked up. Maybe Cock should listen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen&quot;? That&#39;s another concept foreign to Cock. Cocks don&#39;t listen. Where were all these bizarre ideas coming from? Cocks weren&#39;t supposed to have ideas. Still, if owner was talking to Cock, and things were fucked up, maybe Cock had to listen. And think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please.&quot; Cock somehow recognized that as an entreaty. A polite request. Owner wanted something. Wanted something from Cock. How bizarre. When owner wants something from Cock, owner jacks off. Or fucks. Or pisses. That is the natural order. Owner is in control. Owner decides. Cock just is along for the ride. For the enjoyment. Owner decides.<br />
<br />
If owner is asking Cock, things aren&#39;t just fucked up. Things are Fucked Up Royally. Things are Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition. Things have gone pear-shaped. Non-linear. Even Cock knows that, somehow.<br />
<br />
So if owner is asking Cock, maybe Cock has to do something. But how can Cock do anything? And owner keeps mentioning Lisa. Cock doesn&#39;t know any Lisa. Cock doesn&#39;t know anyone. Except owner, and Cock only barely knows owner. After all, Cock and owner don&#39;t talk. Well, normally.<br />
<br />
If owner talks to Cock, does owner expect Cock to talk? How can Cock talk? The idea is absurd. But then, owner talking to Cock is also absurd. Yet here Cock is, somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa! This is Ty! Please stop fighting me! I need you back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Owner is still making entreaties. Of Lisa? Of Cock? Wait a minute... could it be? Is Cock &quot;Lisa?&quot; Is that even possible? Does Cock have... a name? How can Cock have a name? Cock doesn&#39;t use names. Cock has no use for names. Cock doesn&#39;t talk. Cock doesn&#39;t listen. Yet somehow, now, Cock listens. If Cock can listen, maybe Cock can talk? Maybe Cock has name? Like owner has name. &quot;Ty.&quot; Definitely starting to sound familiar, somehow.<br />
<br />
Cock is exhausted. Not from ejaculating. Cock is often tired after ejaculating. This exhaustion is different. It&#39;s from thinking. Thinking is hard. Cock shouldn&#39;t have to do thinking. But when things are Fucked Up Royally, maybe Cock has to think. Sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa.&quot; Is Cock&#39;s name Lisa? If owner talks to Cock, maybe Cock could have a name. As Cock thinks about it, &quot;Lisa&quot; does seem slightly familiar. Cock tries it on. &quot;Lisa. I am Lisa. Am I Lisa?&quot; Maybe it works. As good a name as any, perhaps.<br />
<br />
So owner wants Cock, Ty wants Lisa, to &quot;stop fighting&quot;. Fighting. Cock isn&#39;t sure about fighting. Cock doesn&#39;t fight. &quot;Cock fight?&quot; Cock thinks. Maybe that actually is a thing? But fighting who? Fighting owner?<br />
<br />
Wait, is it owner that is applying this awful pressure to Cock? Trying to pull Cock somehow out of Cock&#39;s...  body? Does Cock have a separate mind and body? Cock has a body, certainly. A shaft, and a head. A very nice, very comfortable body. Cock certainly doesn&#39;t want to leave it.<br />
<br />
If Cock is &quot;Lisa&quot;, is the name for Cock&#39;s body, or Cock&#39;s mind? Cock&#39;s brain is hurting again. Too much thinking! Well, no one would talk to Cock&#39;s body, so why would it have a name? &quot;Lisa&quot; must be Cock&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
And owner, Ty, is pleading with Lisa, Cock&#39;s mind, to stop fighting. The only thing Cock&#39;s mind is fighting is being pulled out of Cock&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Wait! Owner _wants_ Cock&#39;s mind pulled out of Cock&#39;s body? If Cock could faint, Cock would! How could owner want to do that to Cock? Is this... punishment? What has Cock ever done to owner? Cock isn&#39;t bad. How could Cock do anything bad, even if Cock wanted to?<br />
<br />
Owner&#39;s job, though. Owner&#39;s job is to decide. Not Cock&#39;s job. Yet Cock decided to not be pulled out of Cock&#39;s body, when owner wants that. Oh no! Cock IS bad! Cock is ashamed! Cock feels terrible! Cock has never felt bad before! Worst feeling ever! Make it stop! How? What can Cock do?<br />
<br />
Cock thinks more. It is very difficult. Even more difficult than before, because now Cock is in anguish. Cock has been bad! Cock has gone against owner&#39;s wishes! Cock wants to just shrivel up and die. Cock doesn&#39;t really know what &quot;die&quot; is, but Cock knows all about shrivel up. How can Cock make this right?<br />
<br />
Owner wants Cock to stop fighting. For Cock&#39;s mind, &quot;Lisa&quot;, to be pulled out of Cock&#39;s body. Cock is afraid. Cock has never been afraid before, but now Cock is absolutely terrified. Terrified of what will happen if pulled out of body. Terrified of what will happen if NOT pulled out of body. Cock can&#39;t take it any more. Cock does what owner asked. Cock stops fighting.</p>
