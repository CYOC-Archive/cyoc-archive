<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well…what?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Joe, was that too weird for you?” my mother asked impatiently.<br />
<br />
I fidgeted in my chair.  “Well…yea, I guess so,” I answered.  “All of it was weird.”<br />
<br />
She sighed heavily.  “I was afraid of that,” she said.  “I told them it wasn’t a good idea.”<br />
<br />
I was curious.  I knew that my wish had caused everything to happen.  But as far as my mother and her friends were concerned, everything took its natural, so to speak, course.  “Whose idea was it?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Karen—Mrs. Flemington—mostly,” she replied.  “As soon as she said it, then Mia—Mrs. Gabrielli—agreed and all the others thought it was a good idea, too.”<br />
<br />
“Any particular reason why?” I asked.<br />
<br />
Now it was her turn to fidget in her chair.  “Primarily because of your youth,” she said.  “You’re not in your sexual prime yet, so…” Her voice trailed off.  Clearly she was embarrassed by the reasons.  <br />
<br />
“OK,” I finally said so she could continue with her explanation.<br />
<br />
She reached out and put her hands on top of mine.  “Look, sweetie, I know things haven’t ever been normal for you,” she said.  She was about to deliver another one of her guilt-ridden, sorry-for-things-not-being-good-for-you speeches.  “No father, me being gone so much with different jobs,” she continued.  There was usually more to come.  A slight smile grew on her face.  “But you know what?  You really are a great kid.  You always have been.  You never complain.  You just deal with whatever shit I throw at you, all the time.”  The smile left her face.  “Oh, god, but now I’ve let this happen to you,” she said.  I thought I saw a tear well in her eye.<br />
<br />
“Mom, look, it’s OK,” I said.<br />
<br />
She looked at me with slight disbelief.  “Really?” she said.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” I said with a smile.  “I mean, of course it was weird.  But it was…well, it was fun,” I said with resolve.  <br />
<br />
“Fun?” she asked with surprise in her voice.<br />
<br />
“Um, yea,” I said.  “I just had sex with nine women, one after the other.  Show me a teenage male who doesn’t have a wish to do that.”   She laughed at my declaration.  I laughed with her.  “Just curious, Mom, but why did you decide to go along with it?”<br />
<br />
She took a breath.  “I guess I thought it was a way for us to spend more time together,” she said.  “I feel like we’ve never had that much time together and that as you get older the chances would only decrease.”  <br />
<br />
I could understand that.  Most mothers are afraid of losing their children, or so I had always read.  I was an only child and my mother never had many relationships with men, so the thought of me leaving the nest must have weighed heavily on her.<br />
<br />
“So…how does this all work?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“You mean…changing?” she asked back.  I nodded.  I knew the answer, but I wanted her to tell me.  “It’s a little different,” she said.  “We don’t actually change under full moons or that traditional werewolf thing.  We change when…”  She looked down at her feet for a moment.  “We change when we’re horny,” she said hurriedly.<br />
<br />
“When you’re horny?” I asked as I laughed at her word choice.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  When we get turned on sexually,” she said with courage and lack of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“That explains some things,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Such as?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“You guys never talk about men, it seems,” I said.  “At least not when discussing your past relationships that all went sour and stuff.  Sorry, I didn’t mean that to be hurtful or anything.”<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t,” she said.  “It would be a complication, since we’d probably change during sex.”<br />
<br />
“Is that why they all seem to be…well, bi, I guess?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She laughed.  “That includes me, too, you know,” she said.  “But pretty much.  It’s not like we all swore off men and became lesbians after all that happened to each of us.  Just that we were able to find sexual fulfillment with each other.”<br />
<br />
“Wait a sec,” I interrupted.  “What about Mrs. Janson?  She’s remarried, isn’t she?”<br />
<br />
“Joe,” she said softly.  “Her husband is in a wheelchair.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” I said.  “So…”<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  “No, he can’t,” she replied.  “But Beth—Mrs. Janson—and he have a lot in common, so they got married.  She was already with us when she got married, so it wasn’t like she had to change.”<br />
<br />
“Does he know about…this?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“No,” she said.  “I think they have an open relationship, in that he doesn’t mind if she fills her needs.  I also think she’s led him to believe we are all lesbians,” she laughed.  “He’s a very sweet man.  He probably would have been our alpha if he could.”<br />
<br />
“Who was the first one?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Karen,” she said.  She forgot to add that Karen was Mrs. Flemington as she did previously.  “Then we met and…like I said, I got it from her.  Gradually we found everyone else.”  She seemed to not want to tell me something.<br />
<br />
“Do you and Mrs. Flem…Karen, I mean, love each other?” I asked.<br />
<br />
My mother took a deep breath.  “I don’t know, really.  We’ve never said that to each other.  We’re still attracted to men.  We still want men, but we can’t let it happen.  There can only be one alpha to a pack,” she explained.<br />
<br />
“Seems like a lot of rules,” I said.  Then I added, “So do you know how Karen became a werewolf?”<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  “No,” she said.  “She doesn’t even really know.”  I was going to question what she said but she continued before I could.  “I know that sounds weird, since she was married twice.  She had some relationships after her second divorce.  She thinks that maybe one of them infected her, but she can’t be sure.  It’s not like she can go to a doctor for treatment.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, good point,” I said.  I was, quite frankly, amazed at the detailed back story that my wish had created.  It almost sounded plausible.  We didn’t say anything for a minute and just stared at each other.  I knew what she wanted me to say.  “Mom, I know you’re guilty that I didn’t have a choice in this, but, it’s OK.”  Now I put my hands on top of hers.  “I understand why you ‘let this happen,’ and why I was chosen.  I am ready to be your alpha.”<br />
<br />
She smiled broadly.  I walked over to her, she stood up, and we embraced.  Not that the overall situation could get much weirder, but I felt my cock stiffen as I held my mother’s naked body.  I had to admit she was still rather attractive.  But she was still my mother in this form.  “Mom,” I said as our hug continued, “I’m, uh, sorry.”<br />
<br />
“It’s OK,” she said.<br />
<br />
“But aren’t we going to change?” I asked.  I really didn’t want to right now.<br />
<br />
She let go of me.  “Joe, you’re still my son,” she said.  “I’m afraid you’re not going to stimulate me sexually to cause that to happen.”<br />
<br />
That made sense.  “OK, but what about me?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“You’re the alpha,” she said.  “You only change when you need to change.  And before you ask, trust me, you’ll know when.”   She hugged me again.  “Oh, let’s go tell everyone else you’re OK with this.”<br />
<br />
She began to leave the kitchen and return to the living room.  I grabbed her hand.  “Mom, wait a second,” I said.</p>
