<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">May had closed her eyes in the final minutes of the transformation - she became dizzy as everything whirled around her as her eyes rearranged their position.<br />
<br />
As her eyes opened, she saw the television, and the emergency program was still on, just there were no reporters apparently present.<br />
<br />
She could still control her (now their) body, at least until Carrie woke up as she was walking.  Their legs froze, and they nearly fell over before May, Carrie, and a just awoken Zac quickly maneuvered their legs to make themselves fall into a chair.  They all sat down, took a breath, asked each other if they were okay, and wondered why all three of their fields of vision were situated so low on their body - between a pair of womanly legs, and why their voices weren&#39;t coming from a point of origin that should have been under their eyes.<br />
<br />
Odd sensations were coming from above.  Carrie&#39;s breasts were somehow pressing against Zac&#39;s pecs.  With some odd maneuvering, Carrie somehow got her hands to clasp Zac&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Panicked, the three worked together to (awkwardly) control their leg movements as they stumbled towards the first floor bathroom.  After slamming into the door (which was extra odd as they felt two shoulders hit it) and struggling to grab the handle, they burst into the bathroom and turned on the lights. <br />
<br />
The reason why their fields of vision were so low was because all of their eyes had been moved to May&#39;s head, which was now snugly situated where Carrie&#39;s crotch would be, protruding from a short neck attached to where Carrie&#39;s vagina should have been.  It was still in the same area though - replacing a nose and a mouth on May&#39;s head was her vagina, which was surrounded by the family&#39;s eyes.  May&#39;s&#39; eyes lay where they originally did, while Carrie&#39;s were located on May&#39;s upper cheeks, to the sides of the vagina, and Zac&#39;s were located on May&#39;s lower cheeks, to the lower sides of the vagina.  They all widened in shock before gazing at the rest of their body.<br />
<br />
The rest of the family&#39;s body was a strange amalgamation of all of their original ones.  <br />
<br />
The legs and butt of their body were clearly Carrie&#39;s - they had beautiful flower tattoos that she had gotten a few months back.  The body&#39;s hips and stomach, however, were that of Zac&#39;s.  Running a hand up their smooth, soft thigh into stiff, firm pecs, the strange sight, made stranger by the difference in skin tones, became even more real.<br />
<br />
On top of the lower torso (stomach) were the upper torsos of Carrie and Zac, only they were facing towards each other, Carrie&#39;s breasts, exposed by shredded clothing, were pressed against Zac&#39;s pec&#39;s at all times.  Zac&#39;s upper torso was facing forward as normal, but Carrie&#39;s was jutting out of the area above their shared stomach, facing towards Zac&#39;s.  Attached to their torsos were their respective arms and heads - which had no eyes.  They also had very slightly enlarged lips, but regular noses.<br />
<br />
A few more odd changes caught the eyes of the family.<br />
<br />
The first most prominent change was the fact that May&#39;s mouth had taken the place of the family&#39;s body&#39;s belly button.<br />
<br />
The second was that, where Zac and Carrie&#39;s upper bodies met with the family&#39;s body&#39;s stomach, May&#39;s arms jutted out on each side.  They, for some reason, ended in Zac&#39;s feet instead of her dexterous hands, jutting out, ankles and all, from where her wrists would have been.<br />
<br />
The third was that May&#39;s breasts had fused with the family&#39;s body&#39;s buttocks - they had her nipples at the center of them, and if it weren&#39;t for the fact that all their clothes were shredded, the rubbing of the jeans she was wearing earlier in the day against them would have made them all aroused beyond imagination - they had become swollen and hypersensitive.  They didn&#39;t know that yet though<br />
<br />
The fourth was that Zac&#39;s penis was situated above the family&#39;s buttocks, testicles and all.  It was abnormally larger than it had been previously - its testicles were tennis-ball sized and the penis , which was now as thick as a can of Pringles, extended, rock hard, all the way up to the back of Zac&#39;s head.  It was circumcised, which it had not been before, and just below its head were both of May&#39;s hands, attached by the wrists, one on each side of the penis.  They had six fingers now, and were as veiny and pink as the rest of the penis.  The wrists were elongated so that the palms of the hands were always an inch in front of the penis&#39; head when not moved.<br />
<br />
Looking at each other and then giving their butt a shake, the penis wiggled along with it.  In an instant, it suddenly went softer, and drooped down, before it suddenly perked back up and curled around as May&#39;s hands clapped and grasped the other&#39;s.  May&#39;s mouth smiled and she giggled as she began figuring out how their tail worked.<br />
<br />
In a half hour, the family found out who had primary control over which body parts, and how to coordinate and cooperate so as to share body part function easily - it only involved relaxing a limb and then allowing for another to take it over.<br />
<br />
The family then stumbled out of the bathroom, with Zac closing the door with his daughter&#39;s hands attached to his penis tail (with a slightly pleasurable feeling they all stopped to feel) before heading upstairs to take a (an awkward) shower.</p>
