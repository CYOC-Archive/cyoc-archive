<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Phoebe had no idea just how small she could feel, but here she was suddenly surrounded by enormously buxom amazonian women with knee length schlongs. It was just after her meeting with the principal of her new school and when Ricarda was showing her to her dorm room when she finally saw more of her soon to be peers. Phoebe stuck out like a sore thumb surrounded by these hyper sexual futanari, or as the case may be… like an erection. Phoebe had no boobs, no curves, and was only so tall, not to mention the lack of meat in her pants.<br />
<br />
So no wonder when surrounded by these heavily endowed women she would end up garnering a surprising amount of attention. If they weren’t staring at her from afar, they were walking up to her to say hello like excitable puppies. God how much their assets bounced as they walked, especially the bulges in their crotches threatening to flop out of their panties at any given moment, and indeed some have. The only ones who weren’t talking interest in her were the ones who were literally having sex in public! It was no wonder that the air around here smelled heavily of semen.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” Ricarda realized, “you aren’t used to public sex being so normalized. Err… well… no better time than the present to get desensitized, right?”<br />
<br />
“R-right,” Phoebe croaked.<br />
<br />
“It looks like at least those girls are using protection,” Ricarda stroked her chin, “Don’t wanna end up pregnant while you’re still in school.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ricarda,” Phoebe’s eyes locked on one girl who had very unusual ears. They were long and floppy like a lop eared rabbit, and the girl’s dick was a rabbit dick.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, that’s a kemonomimi,” Ricarda explained, “She went through a procedure to give herself animal ears for fun… and a matching animal dick for more fun. She probably got it as part of a class project or for high grades, otherwise it’s crazy expensive.”<br />
<br />
“So like, cat girls and stuff?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly like cat girls and stuff,” Ricarda nodded, “Well, cat futanari and stuff anyway. You can even get a horse cock and that’s it if you want, that’s a popular procedure.”<br />
<br />
“S-sure…” Phoebe said, rather unsure, “horse cocks are popular…”<br />
<br />
“Ooh! I forgot to mention what sports we play!” Ricarda exclaimed, “I think one of our basketball captains is around here somewhere.” The tall blonde dickgirl scanned the dorm commons, looking through a sea of girls and cocks. “That’s her over there in the b-ball jersey! C’mon, I’ll introduce you!” She took Phoebe by the wrist and led her to the basketball captain.<br />
<br />
The girl was sitting at a table with other members of her team sharing what looked like fruit punch… and handjobs. The captain was wearing only her jersey, with her titanic torpedo tits hanging through the bottom. Her skin was a smooth olive color, and her hair was a brownish raven tone. Of course, Phoebe’s attention was on her crotch, staring at a two foot python flanked by softball sized nuts. Poor Phoebe was going a bit pale in the face, about ready to vomit from neuroticism after how much genitalia she’d been exposed to.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Dickie,” the basketball captain greeted Ricarda, “good to see ya. This the new girl?”<br />
<br />
“Hi-hi to you too, Lana,” Ricarda beamed, “This is Phoebe Alice, the new girl. Phoebe, this is Lana Hard, captain of our dorm building’s basketball team. The 69’ers!”<br />
<br />
“Of course that’s the name,” Phoebe croaked.<br />
<br />
“And why wouldn’t it be?” Lana asked, “We love our dick jokes here, and if you’re gonna attend this school you’re gonna get pounded with them. I say just take the whole cock and stuff it up ya, that’s what I say.” That’s the line that made Phoebe’s knees give out, dropping her on all fours to purge the nervous bile that’d been forming in her esophagus.<br />
<br />
“I think this is a bit too much excitement for one girl to handle,” Ricarda chuckled worriedly, “Lana, could you help me get her into a chair?” They got Phoebe seated and gave her a glass of water to wash the taste of anxiety vomit out of her mouth and rehydrate her. The new girl was still trembling like a terrified fawn.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry,” she croaked, “I’m sorry… I don’t know what went over me.”<br />
<br />
“It’s cool, girl,” Lana shrugged, “you just ain’t used to seeing so many naughty bits at once. No time like the present to get desensitized, right?”<br />
<br />
“R-right,” Phoebe nodded, eyes glued to the glass in her hands, “it’s just… I’m not that kind of person, you know?”<br />
<br />
“I think so,” Ricarda replied, “Most people aren’t on their first day, or even their first month. Heck, it took <i>me</i> half a year to come to terms with my new existence. It doesn’t have to be all at once if you don’t want it to, or if you can’t.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think I want it to happen <i>ever,</i>” Phoebe weepily sighed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, honey,” Lana placed a consoling hand on the new girl’s shoulder, “neither did a lot of us. I don’t know what to tell you. I guess maybe that it gets easier as it goes? It did for me, anyway.”<br />
<br />
“And it’s not <i>all</i> sexual here,” Ricarda assured, “it’s just kinda unavoidable most of the time. But you <i>will</i> get used to it, I promise.”<br />
<br />
“<i>Promise</i> promise?”<br />
<br />
“Cross my balls, hope to die.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Phoebe nodded, “thank you.” She looked up into Lana’s face, making sure to maintain eye contact and avoid letting her eyes wander. “So… basketball?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah,” Lana smiled, “I’m the captain of the 69’ers, y’know? My team do pretty well for ourselves. Got second place in the school championship last year. Of course, since we’re the only futanari school for leagues we have more than one team for each of the four dorm buildings. And it’s not just basketball here either. We also have golf, swimming, and track and stuff. There’s even two local sports we enjoy, Fuck Wrestling and Dorse Polo.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what’s ‘Fuck Wrestling’ entail?” Phoebe dreaded asking.<br />
<br />
“It’s like Olympic wrestling,” Lana explained, “Except your goal is to pin the girl to the mat and stick your dick in her ass to win the round. If you manage to cum inside you win automatically, otherwise it’s best of five rounds.”<br />
<br />
“And ‘Dorse Polo’, I presume, has a similar erotic twist?”<br />
<br />
“Well you know how regular Polo has horses or whatever?” Lana continued, “Dorse Polo replaces horses with ‘dorses’, which based on your face is probably a topic best left for later.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously, you’re going to need rest before you learn what those are,” Ricarda concurred, “and on that note we should probably get you into bed.”<br />
<br />
“M’kay,” Phoebe mumbled.<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
“A whole room to myself?” Phoebe inquired as she was led into her new dorm room.<br />
<br />
“Yup, unless you <i>want</i> a roommate,” Ricarda confirmed, “which you might end up wanting eventually. So before you turn in for the night, do you have any more questions?”<br />
<br />
Phoebe mulled it over, and decided that if she was going to be a student here, then she might as well learn to embrace her new surroundings. So with a deep breath, she decided to ask the boldest thing she could.<br />
<br />
“May I… p-p-p-play with your penis before you leave?”</p>
