<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are in the current dilemma of choosing your new attire when you notice something. From the hallway you could look into your bedroom or the “guest room” it had been altered to. It seems that a suitcase was lying underneath your bed.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” You wonder as you walk over to your bedroom and crouch to grab it your. Due to your new age, you find it hard to get back up once you’ve gotten down so you decide to just open the ragged suitcase. You unzip from the side and open the suitcase to see some clothes that surprise you.<br />
<br />
It’s your old clothes or more precisely your old boxers you used to wear when you were your appropriate age. “Wait! I thought reality had completely altered….” You say in surprise but just as you are in deep thought a sudden pounding from downstairs awakens you. It was the delivery man and he sounded a little impatient! You decide to figure out things later and run to your Dads room and put on his pajamas while going commando.<br />
<br />
His pajamas fit your new body well although they are slightly loose so perhaps you weren’t as heavy as your Dad was. You quickly sign the clipboard as the man gives you the new microwave your Dad had ordered before he angrily walks away muttering things under his breath. You place the box on the coffee table before closing the front door. You then rush back to your room, worried the suitcase may disappear but the suitcase still laid opened with your boxers inside.<br />
<br />
“I wonder…” you begin to think and quickly take off your Dads pajamas before picking up a pair of your old boxers. You put them on your body and feel the fabric tightly compress over your much too wide figure. <br />
<br />
“These things are so tight!’ You say as you feel then dig into your waist. Then the boxers start to become more comfortable as if you were slightly begging to become adjusted to them. You look and notice your stomachs slowly start to recede and realize that you’re actually adjusting from your boxers.<br />
<br />
Your arms and legs become thinner as your body hair shrinks leaving your body bare except for your pubes and light covering on your arms and legs. Speaking of hair, your hairline starts to disappear as your bald spot slowly regrows your hair. Your body also continues to lose weight as your moobs and beer belly slowly fade.<br />
<br />
“NIcE to nOt be So hAIry anyMoRe,” you say aloud before clasping at your throat. Your voice had begun cracking as it began to lift in pitch. You feel your Adam’s apple become less prominent as your old voice returns. As you return to your proper weight, all the good changes you had also start to leave. Being older gave you a good few inches but you slowly return from being 6’ 2” to being 5’ 9” along with your old 3 inch dick.<br />
<br />
I stare at my hands to see they’re back to normal, thin and lanky with no copious amount of hair covering them. I  walk to the bathroom mirror to see my old face peering back. My crop cut haircut with my light brown hair grown enough to not show a hairline or any bald spots. My awesome beard was gone leaving me clean shaven along with my youthful appearance with no hints of wrinkles or exposure from age. <br />
<br />
I had becomes my old 16 year old self again! I move easily due to my lighter weight and lankier frame and find myself feeling much more energetic than I had previously. Now that I was back to normal I had to figure out what was going on. I run back to my room to see it completely back to normal with the suitcase gone and my old possessions covering my shelves and room.<br />
<br />
I quickly take a shower (since I still reeked from work), put on my own pajamas, and place my Dads pajamas back in his dresser. I find my uniform on the ground along with my Dads tighty  whities outside the bathroom door and place the underwear in my dirty laundry pile. I would probably wash it tomorrow considering my parents got home from their trip Sunday night.<br />
<br />
Now to figure things out! I grab my phone to see the text message gone and my Dad marked as Dad instead of Luke as he was before. I open my notes and jot down my thoughts.<br />
<br />
 It seemed that I was momentarily aged after I put on my Dads underwear. “But how?” I wonder and more importantly why did I only turn 40 and not 45 like the actual age my Dad was. Something else that bothered me was how my surroundings kept changing. I assume that while I worked at the bakery I slowly aged but nobody noticed and it seemed that reality had shifted to fit my new form for my surroundings and the people I was nearby.<br />
<br />
While I was 40, I was a house sitter, since it didn’t make sense that I wouldn’t be living in my brothers house but why was there a suitcase in this room after reality altered and why was my underwear inside of it. I had plenty of questions and no answers. For now I decided I would just go to work tomorrow commando and figure everything during the week.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
Sunday Night<br />
<br />
I got home annoyed at how Ben had gone back to treating my like shit and realize how I could’ve benefited from being 40 again. I open the front door to see my Dad plugging in the new microwave.<br />
<br />
“Hi, Andrew. We just got home. How was work?’  My Dad asks as I stare at him in confusion. It feels so weird seeing my Dad since I almost looked exactly like him when I turned 40. Would I really look like that in the future? “Andrew?” My dad repeats a look of concern on his face.<br />
<br />
“Yeah it was just a bit boring,” I tell him leaving out the part of how Ben treated me, considering he was my Dad’s friend and all, and walk upstairs to my room. I see my laundry hamper and decided I should probably do my laundry before the smell got any worse. I carry the hamper downstairs and pass my Dad in my attempt to get to the washing machine.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Are those my briefs?” My Dad asks as he scoops out his tighty whities laying on the top of the pile. <br />
<br />
“Yeah. Sorry I had to borrow them because I didn’t do laundry and had to get to work a bit earlier than usual,” I explain to my Dad.<br />
<br />
“But why did you grab this pair? I stopped wearing my tighty whities years ago!” He said with a look of amusement on his face.<br />
<br />
“Wait what!? Then why do you still have them?” I asked him.<br />
<br />
“I just don’t really like to throw things out. But you must’ve dug pretty deep in my dressers to find my old white briefs,” Dad says as he laughs.<br />
<br />
I laugh too not only from my slight sense of embarrassment but from a suddenly realization. I quickly put my laundry to wash and rush back to my room and open my notes again. I think I have figured out what happened. Since my Dad stopped wearing those briefs, I must’ve turned into the age he was when he stopped wearing them which would be 40. That means that I somehow have the ability to age when I put on other clothing but I wondered if it worked in the opposite as well. I decided to experiment tomorrow. After finishing my laundry, taking a shower, and eating dinner with my parents I went to sleep eager for the next morning.<br />
<br />
I awoke Monday morning at seven, probably from a force of habit from school and work, and found myself home alone again due to my parents already leaving for work. Since I had the day off and the house to myself I had free reign to do what I wanted. I want to experiment on myself more but to do that I had to try on something but what?</p>
