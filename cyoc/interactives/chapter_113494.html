<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff headed to the bathroom to take care of his bodily needs and wash up before dinner.  He didn&#39;t feel the massive ripples in reality.   He was aware of what had been, and not really paying attention to the changes in his recent history.  Yes, his mother was now a werewolf, but wolves unlike humans tend to have litters, so he no longer only had one sibling.  He also hadn&#39;t excluded himself from change.  It was one of the reasons he headed to the bathroom, his smelling had grown more acute, and what he perceived as being suddenly over ripe was in fact his normal scent.<br />
<br />
His brother Jack headed straight into Jeff&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Jeff, ma says you gotta help me with my Jack O&#39;Lantern,&quot; said Jack carrying a small pumpkin and a knife.  &quot;Yo bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard the water running in the bathroom, and the humming of the transformer in the Chronivac.  He walked over to the Chronivac, and sat down.  He saw and knew what the Chronivac was, he saw his mother was the subject currently on display, and he was relieved to see that Jeff hadn&#39;t appaently done anything to change her.  Jeff was probably waiting for Jack to get home to test this, Jack thought, well Jeffy, I gotta surprise for you.  You&#39;re going to be my Jeff-O-Lantern.  He grinned a toothy wolfy grin.  His ears rose up the side of his head a bit, and got pointy and furry, as he started to type.  He didn&#39;t want to be surprised by Jeff&#39;s return.  <br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Jeff opened his shirt to wash his armpits and immediately noted how hairy his body had become.  He was aware that he had been smooth chested before using the Chronivac, but now remembered growing his first chest hairs when he was 10.  He shook his head, he hadn&#39;t considered that if his mother was 50% wolf that he would be 25% or 50% wolf depending on his father.  Thinking of his father caused another realization.  His mother had been a single mother raising her two children, but wolves mated for life, and dad still lived with them.  No divorce, and Jeff realized he had a lot more than two siblings.  He bolted from the bathroom, his bedroom door was open.  He dashed through the door, and shouted at the stranger at his desk, whom he suddenly also recognized as &quot;Jack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you do-o-oi-in-ing?&quot;  he stuttered as he felt himself slowing down and freezing in place a few feet behind his brother Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Jeff, cool Chronivac, hope you don&#39;t mind me trying it.  Actually, I don&#39;t care if you mind, because I know you were probably going to try it out on me, and I just beat you to it.  Mom sent me up here to get you to help me with Jack O Lantern.&quot;  He put his hand on the small pumpkin, and turned to face Jeff.  Jeff suddenly felt cold all over.  He realized his clothing had vanished.  He was naked and immobilized by the Chronivac at his brother&#39;s mercy, and his brother was starting to wolf out from his excitement.  Jack sighed, &quot;Kind of a pathetic pumpkin for a Jack O Lantern contest, right, Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes lit up, and he stared Jeff in the eye, &quot;But you, bro, you&#39;ll make a fine big Jeff-O&#39;Lantern!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a hollow feeling inside.  No it was wasn&#39;t fear.  His body was expanding and morphing into a giant gourd.  His penis was rock hard and he suddenly realize as it sank into his flesh that it was growing bigger inside him, and that it was becoming wax.  Oh, Jack, I&#39;m going to kill you if you melt my dick down to nub, thought Jeff.  Jack had made Jeff unaware of his new changes, so even though he knew he was human who had changed his mother into a werewolf, he didn&#39;t think there was anything abnormal about being a werepumpkin or maybe he was a werewolf pumpkin?  Or ?  He wasn&#39;t sure, the soles of his feet vanished into his growing rotund body, and his bare shiny hard butt cheeks came to rest on the floor.  His brother was in glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner!&quot; shouted mom.<br />
<br />
Jack totally wolfed out growing from 5&#39;7&quot; to 8&#39; and ripping out of his shirt.  His loose jeans no longer hung to his ankles and were now skin-tight.  He walked over on his hind paws, and carefully but effortlessly hefted the huge Jeff-O-Lantern up, and carried it toward the door to take Jeff to dinner.  He frowned.  The doorway was way too small for Jeff now. <br />
<br />
Jack had never understood why they had to duck through doorways anyway, so he sat down and typed.  The ceilings rose to 12 feet, and the doorways in the house and hallways grew wider.  He walked out the double doors of Jeff&#39;s bedroom, and downstairs carrying his Jeff-O-Lantern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, looking good, Jeff, I am so glad you agreed to help Jack with his Jack O Lantern contest,&quot; Lauren said.  The kitchen table was gone or rather had been replaced with one lower to the floor.  Dog bowls and water bowls were at 11 places around the table. &quot;But I wish you had waited until after dinner.  I don&#39;t know how you can eat like that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, probs, ma, I&#39;ll eat his dinner too.  It&#39;s the least I can do, and you always say I&#39;m a growing wolfboy!&quot; Jack said setting his Jeff-O-Lantern in a safe corner of the room.<br />
<br />
Jack and Jeff&#39;s mother went to the back door, and opened it.  She stuck her head out, and let out a blood curdling howl.<br />
<br />
A number of howls answered.  The family would soon be home for dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, werewolves!&quot; said Mr. Chaney looking out the window at the rising full moon. &quot;I knew this house was too cheap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lonny,&quot; said his wife, &quot;They&#39;re decent people.  They stay pretty much to themselves, and they don&#39;t howl all night like some do.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed, &quot;Honey, they stay to themselves because I planted wolfsbane all around the house. Though I have heard of worse.  Gregson at work has vampires for neighbors.  Bit his kid too.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Better keep Molly in tonight, don&#39;t want one of those wolves knocking her up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Lonny, wolves don&#39;t normally mate with dogs, and when they mate they&#39;re monogamous.  The neighbors are werewolves, not weredogs.  Molly is perfectly safe in the yard.  Now come to dinner, dear.&quot;</p>
