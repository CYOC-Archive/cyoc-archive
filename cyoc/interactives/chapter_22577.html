<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben knew that he could kiss goodbye to his old life if he was stuck as a Donk Man. He made his mind up there and then that he should go back to the club and find some answers and maybe even a cure.<br />
<br />
Trying to look as inconspicuous as possible, Ben made his way across the city and back to the club, unsure weather he would be spotted or not. When he arrived at the club, there was on sign of life or anything. It was amazing to think what had conspired in that ordinary building only a night ago.<br />
<br />
However, looking up Ben saw that there was an elevated walkway and some pipework connecting the club to a sleek modern building across the alleyway. He new that he was onto something. Walking round the building, he reached the main entrance, which had a large plaque over the door saying:<br />
<br />
“Genetix Ltd – World leaders in Genetic Engineering”<br />
<br />
Ben was certain that all of the answers he was looking for would be in this building. Peering in, he could see that the reception was teeming with security guards and CCTV cameras, he would have to find another way in.<br />
<br />
Sneaking around the back of the building, he saw his chance, a delivery lorry had arrived and was unloading crates into a back door. When no one was looking, Ben sprinted for the door with all his might. His added strength really helped him out there! Once inside he hid behind one of the creates.<br />
<br />
When no one was around, Ben carefully crept towards a door. Opening it slowly, he peered around it, no one was around so he went in carefully closing the door behind him. The offices were all deserted, no one was around. “That's weird” Ben thought. The last office he came to had a computer that was switched on. Going over to it, it was still looked on and it had a report open titled “Trans-Animal Experiments”. Ben's blood ran cold, this must be about what happened to him and his friends at the club. Taking a seat, he took a closer look.<br />
<br />
“The Trans-Animal project was created by Genetix as a way of transforming animals from one kind to another. The possible applications included transforming farm animals to other kinds of more useful animals, such as a chicken to a horse or vice versa. A possible military application was to transform animals into humans, which could then be used to build large armies of solders at the militaries disposal. The project was spearheaded by  Dr Jonathan  Stephens, codenamed “The Man in White” in the adjoining “Pleasure Island Club” building which was used as a cover.<br />
<br />
The project and Dr Stephens were terminated after it was revealed that Human subjects were being used instead of animals, and without consent. Genetix Ltd and the Military feel that this was done in the best interests of us in order to prevent the existence project form becoming public and the possible scandal. All equipment used for the experiments has ally ready been disposed of and the Club will be demolished in order to destroy any remaining evidence. <br />
<br />
In order to transform an animal form one kind to another, the DNA of the new animal must be placed over the existing DNA. A vial with a liquid containing the new DNA can be injected into the subject or administered orally ether in pure form or hidden in food or drink. Once the vial has been administered, the subject must then be subjected to short bursts of gamma radiation, which will cause their existing cells to split, allowing the formula to implant the new DNA into the subjects cells. Any existing formula left over is then filtered out as waste and is removed via the bladder.  After successive gamma treatments, the subject will be fully transformed. However, here have been instances of animals escaping during the gamma treatment, resulting in hybrids. All animal hybrids were captured and studied. It is unknown if any humans escaped part way during treatment, as Dr  Stephens refused to divulge that information before he was terminated. Unfortunately, it is not possible for the animal to revert back to its original form, and it was the companies decision to offer the transformed humans (all were transformed into Donkeys) up for sale to farms instead of terminating them.”<br />
<br />
That explained how Ben was only partially transformed, because he had escaped during his gamma treatment. But he was stuck as this for the rest of his life. He fely angry, but at least he didn't suffer the fate as his friends, destined to live out their lives as farm animals. He felt guilty inside, how his friends were now on some farm now, where as he could could at least have some sort of dignified life, even though he would have to hide his appendages form the world. But he let out a dry smile, he was certainly more muscular and had the equipment any man would be proud of.<br />
<br />
His more sensitive ears picked up voices in the building, he knew he had outstayed his welcome. As quick as he could, he made his way out of the office and made his way back to the storage area. Once his was hiding around the back of a crate, he could see vans pulling up to the entrance, and people loading equipment and boxes of documents into them. They must be pulling out he thought. When no one was looking, he slipped out of the door and quickly walked away without anyone noticing.<br />
<br />
Walking away, he couldn't help but feel sorry for his friends and angry that he was stuck like this for the rest of his life.</p>
