<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam coughed again and cussed Mario out, he couldnt beleive that much dust could come out of such a small box, Adam, went over to Marios bed and tryed to
<br>
 cover up the box and cut down on its expanding cloud of powder, &quot;How the HELL did you get so much powder into that little box Mario?&quot; Adam said, Adam was
<br>
 waveing his arms in the air to clear his space of the powder. 
<br>

<br>
 Mario was laughing so hard he could hardly talk, &quot;Im sorry dude! That wasent supposed to happen. Its micro biotic, it multiplies on its own. Whyed you throw the
<br>
 box on my bed dude?&quot; Mario asked still gigling about it, &quot;What do you mean it multiplys? You mean this shits like a virus or something! OH GOD! WERE
<br>
 BREATHING A VIRUS ARNT WE!&quot; Adam screamed he was freaking out, what the hell was Mario thinking? Why'd he bring a virus into their room! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Its not a virus! Adam. It just acts like one! Besides its harmless trust me.&quot; Mario said still smileing at the look on Adams face. Their door flew open and Stan
<br>
 Burgen came into their room and started waveing his arms in front of his face to clear the air of the smoke, at leist thats what he thought it was, &quot;Man what the hell
<br>
 are you guys burning?&quot; Stan asked in his deep baretone voice, Stan was Adams best friend and fellow teammate on the college baseball team.Stan was a
<br>
 enoumuss guy at 6'5 and 235Lbs of rock solid muscle he towered over most guys at the school, including Adam and Mario, he concidered Mario to be short as
<br>
 hell! 
<br>

<br>
 Stan inhaled volumes of the stuff and began to cough, it gaged his lungs as he stood there and waved more and more of it around the room,&quot;MAN WHAT IS
<br>
 THIS SHIT?&quot; Stan asked as he looked over at Mario who was covering his mouth with a rag, Mario laughed and pulled the rag away from his face and between
<br>
 laughs and gigles he told the two guys what it was supposed to be, then he explained that it was a failed attempt at a reducing agent. 
<br>

<br>
 Stan quickly threw his hand over his mouth and went out side of the room, failyer or not he wasent going to breath anymore of the shit in his lungs, Adam soon
<br>
 followed him out into the hall and the two coughed out and hacked out as much of the yellowish powder as they could, Mario followed after a few seconds and
<br>
 was still laughing at the two big jocks when he joined them in the hall. &quot;This isent funny Mario! You just expossed us to some fucking weird shit you invented in that
<br>
 weird class of yours! HOW DO KNOW ITS NOT GOING TO KILL US!&quot; Adam said in a very angry tone. &quot;Its not alright! Its harmless, DAMB, its just a
<br>
 microb, its not even alive after its expossed to the air. It dies instantly!&quot; Mario told them and walked away. 
<br>

<br>
 Stan had a look of confusion on his handsome face, Stan stood there and took in all of what had just been said and shook his head and then smiled,deep dimples
<br>
 formed on his cheeks when ever he smiled and he was smileing big time now. &quot; Man Adam you need another roommate my friend!&quot; Stan said as he wiped the
<br>
 remaining powder away from his pouty lips,&quot;Lets go man we got practice dude.&quot; Stan said as the two both brushed off the dust from their jeans and tee shirts and
<br>
 headed for the gymnasium, to get ready for baseball practice. 
<br>

<br>
 Mario went to his magic class with a small amount of the powder that had accumulated on the rag he used to cover his face, he was going to test it but he knew he
<br>
 would find nothing, or at leist he hoped he wouldnt. Mario enlisted the help of his teacher Mr Knowls and the two did an asortment of test on the powder, and
<br>
 much to Marios own 
<br>
 dismay the test proved that the spores were still very active and were still growing and multiplying. What they would do to someone who inhaled them was beyond
<br>
 there understanding, the teacher asked him who else had breathed in the spores, Mario reluctantly told him. Marios teacher read the roit act to Mario over even
<br>
 thinking about takeing magic out of the controled enviroment of the class room. And then told him he would have to find Adam and Stan and get them back to his
<br>
 class, Mr Knowls told him he would try to come up with an antidote for the spores while Mario got the other two young jocks back to the class. 
<br>

<br>
 Adam and Stan had already gotten changed and were on the baseball diamond by the time Mario got to the baseball feild. Adam was at first base and Stan was
<br>
 out in the out feild, Mario was starting to feel weird when he got to the feild and had noticed he had to keep pulling his pants up as he walked, they were sliding
<br>
 down his thighs quite easly and he was begining to get alarmed over it, he looked down at his cuffs of the pants and noticed that they were begining to bunch up on
<br>
 top of his shoes! He was getting shorter! His shirt sleeves that he always kept buttoned were begining to cover the tops of his hands. 
<br>

<br>
 Mario knew that Stan had inhaled alot more then he or Adam had Mario knew that when Stan opened the door to their room the tempeture diffrence between the
<br>
 hall and the room had sucked a lot of the powder to the opening of the door and it would have to have been more concentrated at the thresh hold of their door
<br>
 then it was in the room so there for Stan had to have inhaled alot of the powder when he came in then either Adam or he had by just standing in the cloud of static
<br>
 dust! 
<br>

<br>
 Stan had indeed inhaled more of the dust then the two who stood in the fog of the room, Mario knew the room cleared out quicker after Stan opened the door and
<br>
 that meant Stan had inhaled more then the other two had and then Stan stood out in the hall way as well and probably inhaled even more of it out there. Mario
<br>
 could see Adam on first base and he could see that the powder was begining to take its toll on the semi handsome Adam, Adams baseball uniform was begining to
<br>
 look a bit big on him and the straps at the ends of the pant legs that went under his feet was just hanging loose and the crotch area of his uniform was bunching up
<br>
 around the tops of his thighs, Adam seemed to be unaware of it though as he caught a ball and went to throw it to second base to get a runner out, his aim and
<br>
 streanth must have been affected because the ball just grounded a few yards away from it intended goal. 
<br>

<br>
 Mario was trying to find Stan on the feild and fould him in the outfeild he was grabbing at his baseball pants and seemed to be in a state of panic, Mario couldnt see
<br>
 him that clearly but he could tell he deffenetly looked thinner then he should have looked. Mario always liked the way the two studs looked in baseball suits, and he
<br>
 liked Stans look best of all Stan just seemed to fill out the uniform the best it hugged every well developed muscle it encompassed and esetuated it, but now it was
<br>
 begining to look positivly baggy on the poor guy, Mario was shrinking a little faster now and he was forced to have to hold up his pants as he ran to tell Adam they
<br>
 had to go see his teacher, for the antidote. 
<br>

<br>
 Adam was just standing there with a dumb look on his face as he to was shrinking down in height, poor Adam was clutching at his waist line of the baseball pants
<br>
 and fould that the once form fitting pants were now rideing down his thighs quite easly now, Adam was freaking out, but he was also pissed he knew this had to
<br>
 have something to do with the powder that Mario had expossed him to! Adam started to run off the field and so did poor Stan who was fighting to hold up his
<br>
 uniform the whole way into the infeild of the baseball field, Stan didnt seem to be getting shorter though as he ran he was just getting thinner and thinner! 
<br>

<br>
 By the time poor Adam got off the feild to were Mario was standing he had droped in height by two full feet, he was holding up his uniform with a look of pure
<br>
 shock on his face, &quot;WHAT THE FUCKS HAPPENING MARIO?&quot; Adam screamed as he got closer to Mario, poor Adam was quite the site, his baseball
<br>
 uniform was so big on him now that he looked like a kid wearing adult clothes and the crotch of the baseball pants was around his knee area, Mario was alot
<br>
 shorter as well by now and he to looked like he was playong grown up as well, Stan on the other hand looked just as tall as he always did as he came running up
<br>
 clutching the waist of his baseball pants that now looked four sizes to big for his rapidly thinning frame! &quot;WHATS HAPPENING TO ME!&quot; Stan yelled as he got to
<br>
 the guys and looked way down to them,&quot;MY GOD YOUR DWARFS! WHATS HAPPENING TO US?&quot; Stan said his voice sounded higher and his face for
<br>
 some reason seemed to be younger looking as well! 
<br>

<br>
 Stan was now a tall skinny guy, with absolutly no muscle definition on his still tall frame, his long arms looked like a refugees and his face was guant and thin, his
<br>
 baseball jersy hung long on his narrow shoulders and the short sleeves of the uniform were touching his thin knobby looking elbows. Both Mario and Adam looked
<br>
 just as bad Adams shirt had come out of his pants and now hung down to his knees like a dress and his pants that he had let go of had piled up around his baseball
<br>
 shoes that no longer even fit his feet, Mario tryed to explain what had happened but neither of the two once proud studs was listening to him! 
<br>

<br>
 Mario finally got their attention and tryed to explain what was happening to them but he was getting shorter and so was poor Adam, they were both under three
<br>
 feet now and Adam was crying so bad he was haveing trouble breathing, Poor Stan was now just a tall bean pole of a man skinnyer then any guy in the school.</p>
