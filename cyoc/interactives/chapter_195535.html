<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After 4 long hours of partying, the wolf gathering finally began to die down. Todd felt a little disappointed that it was already time to go, but Dan reassured him that this wouldn’t be the last full moon gathering. As the crowd began to disperse, Todd made his way over to where Sam had been waiting for him. <br />
<br />
“S-So?” the wolf stuttered slightly. “H-How do I look?”<br />
<br />
“Like a million bucks,” Sam replied, pulling Todd in for a kiss. The wolf didn’t resist his boyfriend’s advances, allowing the tiger to kiss him for as long as he wanted. When they finally broke their kiss, Todd waved goodbye to Dan and his other pack mates before going back to the dorm with Sam. <br />
<br />
“I’m really proud of you Todd,” Sam said as they walked off the beach. “Watching you go out there and socialize without me to guide you…it made me feel like a father watching their son, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yeah, I know what you mean,” Todd replied, a shy smile on his face. “You have every r-right to feel p-proud. You’ve done s-so much to help me become more comfortable with everything that’s h-happened. For the first t-time in years, I f-feel…<i>happy</i> with myself. A-And I…I wanted to thank you by doing s-something special for you.”<br />
<br />
“And what did you have in mind?” Sam asked, looking at Todd. Their eyes met, and Sam’s heart skipped a beat. Despite how many times he’d stared into Todd’s eyes, he could never get over how gorgeous they were. <br />
<br />
“I want to take things further than we did last night.”<br />
<br />
~     ~     ~     ~     ~     ~     ~     ~     ~     ~<br />
<br />
Sam quickly opened the door to their dorm room and pulled Todd inside. Without skipping a beat, he shut the door, pinned Todd against the door, and began to passionately make out with Todd. The wolf moaned softly into the kiss as he pushed his tongue into Sam’s mouth. He whimpered softly as Sam slipped his hands under Todd’s shirt and lifted it up over his head. Sam quickly threw Todd’s shirt onto the wolf’s bed before guiding the horny canine to his bed. Much like the previous night, Sam scooped Todd up and gently put him in the bed before climbing into the bed on top of him. Todd quickly helped the jock get his shirt off before resuming their intense make out session. <br />
<br />
Their kiss was admittedly a bit strange, as one of them had a muzzle and the other one didn’t. The longer it went on, however, the more natural it began to feel, as Sam’s face began pushing out into a rounded feline muzzle. His nose flattened and changed to a triangular shape as long whiskers grew just below it. White fur began to spread down from his forehead and up from his neck as four of his teeth extended into large fangs, giving him a smile that perfectly matched his charming personality. Todd could feel Sam’s changes happening as he kissed the other male, but he never once felt worried. Sam’s tongue had changed slightly, but it didn’t take on a rough, sandpaper-like texture (much to Todd’s relief). <br />
<br />
When they finally broke their kiss, Sam reached up and felt his new muzzle, rather happy with how it felt. He then looked down at Todd with a grin before moving down to kiss his neck. The wolf moaned softly as Sam gently nipped his skin every now and then. The feline gently caressed Todd’s pecs before showering them with light kisses. He began to gently gyrate his hips, rubbing their bulges together and making the wolf whimper with anticipation. Sam smirked at the wolf’s whimpers before reaching down and unbuttoning Todd’s jeans, pulling them down with his boxers and throwing them to the side.<br />
<br />
“Such a gorgeous body…” Sam said in a seductive tone as he ran a clawed hand against Todd’s cheek. “I think it’s about time that I showed it some love.” Sam moved down and brought his mouth close to Todd’s erect canine cock before running his tongue up the length of the cock. <br />
<br />
Todd moaned out in pleasure as the tiger delicately licked his throbbing member before wrapping his lips around it. He tightly gripped the bed sheets beneath him as Sam bobbed his head up and down the length. Todd squirmed slightly, moaning every so often. The pleasure he was experiencing was nothing like he’d ever felt before. After a few minutes though, Sam removed his mouth from Todd’s cock, making the wolf whine in disappointment. “Why’d you stop?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Two reasons sexy,” Sam replied. “One, I can’t have you cumming just yet, or else we wouldn’t be able to make such a mess. And two…” Sam laid back, propping himself up with his elbows. “I figured you’d like to give it a shot.” Todd looked down at the bulge in jock’s pants. Without wasting a second, he moved closer and began to unbutton Sam’s pants, pulling them down and slipping them off his legs. Now that they were both fully nude, Todd could see Sam’s feline cock, standing erect and practically begging to be sucked. He moved closer, bending down to get as close as he possibly could. He slowly took the tip of the cock in his mouth before beginning to suck. <br />
<br />
Sam let out a moan of satisfaction, placing a hand on the back of Todd’s head. “There you go bud, take it in,” he said. “Remember to breathe through your nose, okay?” The wolf nodded before taking more of the length in his mouth, trying to imitate what Sam had done with his tongue a few minutes prior. The jock put a little pressure on the back of Todd’s head, encouraging him to take more in. <br />
<br />
Before long, Todd had a rhythm going, slowly bobbing his head up and down his boyfriend’s length. “You’re so fucking good at this babe!” Sam moaned, running his claws through the fur on Todd’s head. Every now and then, the wolf would bob his head low enough that Sam’s cock would almost trigger his gag reflex. He wanted to take more, to show Sam how truly grateful he was for everything, but there wasn’t any way for him to fight past his gag reflex. <br />
<br />
After another minute or two, Todd stopped sucking and looked up at Sam. “Did…did I do good?” he asked, tail wagging slightly. Sam smiled and gave Todd another long, passionate kiss. “You did amazing,” he said once they had broken their kiss. “But now it’s time for the main event.”<br />
<br />
Heart racing, Todd laid down on his back and moved his tail to the side, exposing his hole for Sam. The tiger grabbed Todd’s legs and wrapped them around his waist as he moved on top of the wolf. He gently lined the head of his cock with Todd’s eager hole, prodding it slightly. “I wish I had some lube with me, but I didn’t think that I’d be getting any action this soon into the semester,” Sam admitted. “I’m going to go slow, and you tell me if it’s too much, okay?”<br />
<br />
“O-Okay…” Todd replied nervously. Sam nodded and placed his hands on the wolf’s hips before gently pushing in. Todd let out a whine and clenched his eyes shut as his virgin hole was stretched wider than it ever had been. There was a bit of pain, but it was bearable. He felt Sam’s hand brush his cheek. “Breathe…”<br />
<br />
Todd nodded and slowly inhaled as Sam pushed more of his length in. The further in he went, the better Todd felt. The feeling of being filled by his boyfriend, his <i>lover</i>, was nothing like he’d ever experienced, and he wanted more. He used his legs to pull Sam closer, to make him go deeper.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, you’re taking almost all of it…” Sam panted. “Just another inch or two…” The jock grabbed Todd’s legs and used them as leverage to push the last little bit of his cock into the wolf’s ass. Then, he began to pull out. <br />
<br />
“N-No…keep it in me…” Todd whined. Sam gently stroked Todd’s head as he pulled out a bit more…before slowly thrusting back in. The wolf threw his head back and moaned in pleasure as Sam began to build up a rhythm, thrusting slowly in and out. <br />
<br />
“I take it you’re enjoying yourself, pup?” Sam grunted. “You want me to go faster?” Todd only let out a needy whine, which told Sam all he needed to know. He began to pick up the pace of his thrusts, getting rather forceful at points. When Sam’s cock hit a certain spot in Todd&#39;s ass, the wolf let out the cutest moan he’d heard in his life. “You like it when I hit right there pup?”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yeah!”<br />
<br />
“You want me to do it again?”<br />
<br />
“F-Fuck yes!”<br />
<br />
Sam thrust in again, watching as the wolf’s body shook in pleasure each time he hit that same spot. Every moan from Todd pushed the jock closer and closer to release. Every thrust made thick white fur sprout on his face, with black stripes coming in immediately after. The two were breathing in unison as Sam wildly thrust his length into Todd and the wolf cried out in pleasure each time he did. Unable to hold back any longer, Sam thrust one more time into Todd’s ass before firmly grasping the wolf’s hips and flooding his insides with his hot, feline seed. Feeling his lover’s cum inside him was enough to push Todd over the edge, as the wolf let out a loud howl and shot rope after rope of thick seed onto his chest. Sam rode on his orgasm high, letting the fur cover the last bit of his face and complete his look. Finally, he was a tiger. <br />
<br />
Sam collapsed forward on Todd, which made the wolf nuzzle the crook of his neck. “God…we need to do that again…” Sam panted. Todd nodded his head in agreement. <br />
<br />
“Hey…Sam?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah Todd?”<br />
<br />
“Th-Thank you…for being there for me. I-I love you so much.”<br />
<br />
“I love you too, babe.”<br />
<br />
Sam pulled Todd into another passionate kiss, cuddling and nuzzling together for the rest of the night.</p>
