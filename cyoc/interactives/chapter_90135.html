<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think you&#39;d better tell us a bit more detail than that.&quot; Jeff said<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Way!&quot; Carol said. &quot;You diddle yourself eight to ten times a day?  How do you have time to get anything done?! And how do you not have arms like Popeye?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne did her best to ignore her daughter&#39;s incredulous questions.  She was relieved Jeffrey had put his cock away; seeing it there, hard and available, had revved up her hormones something fierce.  Jeffery&#39;s playing with her tits and petting her over the course of dinner hadn&#39;t helped keep her mind off sex either.  In a way it felt like a relief to get this out in the open.  She was thankful Jeff&#39;s curiosity had finally let her secret out of the bag.  She folded her hands in her lap over her bare pussy.  Jeffrey hadn&#39;t specifically asked her to show it to him, but he clearly enjoyed seeing it.  She saw him frown and instead moved her hands to her knees, pushing her boobs together slightly with her upper arms.  She smiled as her son flushed, she&#39;d guessed right that he&#39;d enjoy this pose more.  But she couldn&#39;t put off answering him forever.  She licked her lips and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s pulse raced as his mom&#39;s rack bulged as she breathed deep, then let it out with a sigh.  She wasn&#39;t looking at him or at Carol as she started talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;It, it wasn&#39;t too bad after your father died.  I&#39;d touch myself in the shower, or at night in bed missing him beside me.&quot; She swallowed a sudden stab of sorrow; Jim had been her first and only lover, losing him to an embolism had been like losing a part of herself.  She&#39;d kept up a strong persona for her children, but as Jeffrey had demonstrated tonight they were both adults now, perhaps it was time to stop acting.<br />
<br />
&quot;About a year ago, you remember when I brought Mark Reynalds home for dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh, he&#39;s like, the only guy you&#39;ve ever brought home to meet us.&quot; Carol said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after you kids went to bed Mark and I stayed up talking and finishing the bottle of wine he&#39;d brought.  He started, well I guess maybe we were both a bit tipsy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, you fucked that smarmy asshole?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carol, what&#39;s your problem?  Let Mom say more than two sentences in a row, damnit!&quot; Jeff snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Jeff, it&#39;s just, when I was getting him the cork screw he, well, I saw his reflection in the microwave and he was checking out my ass like he planned to plant a flag in it.&quot; Carol crossed her arms and hunched over in her seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I wish you&#39;d said something, I&#39;m truly sorry I ever brought him home.&quot;  Anne got up and shuffled around the table to give her daughter a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets move this into the den, the dishes can wait a bit tonight.&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Anne walked beside Carol, one arm around her daughter, the other keeping her pants and panties from sliding all the way down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey?  You told me earlier to ask if you&#39;d like me to take my top off.&quot;  Anne felt her pulse start to race again<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Jeff turned to look at her.  &quot;They look kinda painful sticking out like that..&quot;  He trailed off as he stared at her exposed crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit, but if that&#39;s how you want them...&quot; Anne felt heat rising between her legs.  she hadn&#39;t had a man look at her like this since her husband died.  Well, aside from Mark.  Oh the guys at work would sneak glances, and her clients were occasionally a bit pervy, but watching a man get turned on looking at her, and knowing she&#39;d do whatever he wanted had her pussy getting wetter by the second.  She shook her head slightly, this was her son, Jeffrey, not some random man.  <br />
<br />
She remembered her initial response when Jeff had made her look like his ex-girlfriend: a surge of excitement that if she wasn&#39;t in her own body then it wasn&#39;t breaking any laws for her to fuck her son who reminded her so much of his father when they were teens in high school together.  It had taken all her strength of will not to go through with it after he put her in that sexy outfit; clearly he found her as appealing as she did him.  She trembled, remembering the way he&#39;d touched her at dinner.  She&#39;d have done anything he asked, as as she felt her lust dribbling down her thighs she realized she still would.  She looked at her son, at the sudden erection tenting his pants.  Part of her wanted him to ask her to fuck him, part of her wanted to do it without him asking.  &#39;No!&#39; She thought, I am not going to rape my son, no matter how horny he makes me.  She almost missed his strangled answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, ah, guess you might as well take it off then.&quot;  Jeff fought to keep his voice from cracking as his mother let go of her pants and peeled off her sweater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff?  Do you want me to get naked too? Carol asked, already starting to pull her top off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sh-sure!  We&#39;ll all get naked together tonight.&quot; Jeff gasped out.  he turned and hurried into the den and closed the drapes. His mom, wearing nothing but the gold jewelry he&#39;d made her was adjusting the gas fire in the hearth. Carol walked in, tossing her panties over her shoulder as she did.  She struck a pose, standing with her legs spread and her hands on her hips before strutting over an pirouetting to show Jeff her ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;You planning to do anything with that tent pole you&#39;re hiding?&quot; She asked playfully looking over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carol!&quot; Anne snapped. &quot;Stop teasing your brother and sit down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What teasing?  I can&#39;t get myself off anymore, so what Big Brother wants, big brother can have any night of the week!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Young lady do not make me ground you, or I swear I will find a fetish store selling chastity belts and lock that perky little ass of yours up so tight you&#39;ll need my permission to pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, Mom!  That&#39;s gross!&quot; Carol said as she dropped onto her end of the couch.<br />
<br />
Jeff blew out a sigh of relief.  He had enjoyed teasing Carol at dinner, but honestly his mom was so much sexier-- at least until he had a chance to give Carol a tune-up with his computer.  They were both staring at the fire instead of at him.  His mom sitting close enough that her body was silhouetted in the dim room.  &quot;So, what happened with that jerk anyway?&quot; Jeff asked as he started taking his clothes off.<br />
<br />
Anne couldn&#39;t look at her son.  She knew if she watched him undress she&#39;d be on her knees in front of him, her hands and lips wrapped around his cock, breasts pressed against his--she bit her tongue to break that line of thought.  &quot;Oh, well, no sex, but we fooled around a bit.  He hadn&#39;t brought a condom and expected me to go down on him instead, or get him off with my breasts.  I kicked him out, and let him know I wasn&#39;t interested in seeing him again.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shifted position, sitting cross legged instead of kneeling in front of the fire the heat on he breasts and loins was matched by her racing pulse.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was like those sloppy kisses and groping had unlocked two years of sexual desire I hadn&#39;t let myself feel after your father passed.  I got the two of you out the door to school the next day then canceled all my appointments and spent the rest of the day in the tub wearing out vibrator batteries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn.&quot; Carol said softly.<br />
<br />
Anne was surprised as Carol knelt down and wrapped her arms around her. They rocked in the embrace, Carols breast&#39;s warm and soft against her back.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat on his end of the couch watching his sister hug their mom, then settle herself with both arms and legs wrapped around her.  They were whispering to eachother, and Jeff couldn&#39;t quite make out what they were saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, that&#39;s it?  Some jerk gets to second base and suddenly you&#39;re a nympho?&quot;  Jeff wasn&#39;t sure why he was angry, or at what really.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no honey, I went back on the wagon after that, but one day after my lunch work out I stopped in the unisex stall at the gym.  I think it was knowing that I was in a place where men could get naked and haul out their junk that I, well, it took a while before I was able to hurry into the locker room and shower away the smell of what I&#39;d been doing.&quot;  Anne paused as Carol&#39;s hug tightened for a moment.  &quot;After that I figured out ways to be more discrete, and well, at first it was just my lunch break, then my morning and afternoon breaks as well.  When I was showing houses to clients I&#39;d find time to visit a clean gas station or two, and a couple months ago I started doing it when I got to work early, and right before heading home at the end of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne felt tears running down her cheeks.  &quot;I went to see Dr Fentle, the therapist I saw for grief counseling.  She referred me to a colleague for sexual addiction, but I haven&#39;t worked up the courage to make an appointment.<br />
<br />
Jeff heard Carol say something softly to their mother and her whisper back.  He couldn&#39;t believe it.  He could easily imagine his perfect soccer mom fingering herself in bathrooms all day long, but that was a fantasy, some daydream, not a reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; he asked, trying to distract himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister asked about doing it at home, and I explained I do it when I first wake up and gain in the shower, then right after I get home, and a couple times before I go to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mom, I...&quot;</p>
