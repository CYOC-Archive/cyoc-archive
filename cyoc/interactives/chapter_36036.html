<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well we could have sex&quot; Karen suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you weren't ready?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I am now&quot; Karen said. &quot;Now hush and let's get to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen kissed Rick deeply and started caressing his back. Rick didn't think about how weird this was. He just went with it and kissed back. His pussy was getting wetter by the second. Karen layed Rick down on the bed and began rubbing his pussy. When she inserted a couple of fingers he moaned softly. Finally after teasing him Karen inserted her dick into his pussy. The feeling was sheer ecstasy for him. Karen was half way in when she stopped and started to pull out. He was just about to say something when she suddenly thrust her dick into him and he felt something tear inside him.<br />
There was a brief moment of pain then immense ecstasy as Karen kept thrusting in and out. Perspiration was starting to break out on his body and he was breathing heavily. He started moaning again as his body started tensing up. Karen was also moaning and Rick could feel her body tensing. Finally Rick gave out a long, low moan as he had his first female orgasm. He could feel Karen's dick spasm in him as<br />
she moaned and had her first male orgasm. After a few seconds Karen collapsed on top of Rick.<br />
<br />
Just then a voice came from the open doorway. &quot;Karen!&quot; Alice said in a shocked tone.<br />
<br />
Karen reacted by sitting up and covering herself with a sheet. &quot;I can explain Mom&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you can Rick&quot; Alice said in disbelieving tone. She had closed the door by this time and asked &quot;Why did you call me Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We seem to have switched bodies Miss Punnit&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Karen I'll bite&quot; Alice said. &quot;How did you switch bodies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the Medallion of Zulo Mom&quot; Karen said. &quot;Rick found it and he showed me it. When I grabbed it a blue spark leaped between us then we changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So where's the medallion at?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;On my nightstand&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
Alice went over to Karen's nightstand and picked up the medallion. After she had examined it she said &quot;Well this is the medallion. So you two had grabbed it at the same time and it turned you into each other. Of course you would then take off your ill fitting clothes. I guess I won't punish you since you were both thrust into bodies you weren't used to. Teenage hormones can be tricky even if you grow into them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we're not in trouble?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Alice said. &quot;Now get dressed and come downstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
Just then the lights went out leaving them in the dark and Alice said &quot;Oh great.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lights came back on and Karen asked &quot;Mom, where's the medallion?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice looked at her empty hand and said &quot;Shit, it's been taken again. I'm sorry you two but it looks like you're stuck as each other now. We'll have to go see Dr. Mezzner. Won't she be surprised to see me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do?&quot; Rick asked. &quot;I can't go home like this. My parents will freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen, you'll have to call Rick's parents and tell them that you're going to stay here until Monday&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I have to say that I'm staying here?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because like it or not you have Rick's body and voice now&quot; Alice said. &quot;His parents may think that he's going crazy or something and insist that he get some help. That would mean that you would be the one they come to get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick could explain it to them&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't work&quot; Rick said. &quot;I could explain it to them and they wouldn't believe it. They would think that we were playing a joke on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want a repeat of last winter?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don't&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened last winter?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie had decided to become a little girl&quot; Alice said. &quot;I had invited her parents over to witness her change and her father accused me of using drugs. He even accused me of slipping his son some and he called the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why aren't you in jail right now?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I called Dr. Mezzner and she was able to fix things so the cops wouldn't come&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can't let them know that we switched bodies and are now stuck&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Alice said. &quot;At least you have a four day weekend. We can go see Dr. Mezzner on Monday. That will give both of you some time to get used to your new bodies. Now get dressed you two then come downstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and could you stop calling me Mom&quot; Alice said. &quot;It's weird hearing it out of Rick's mouth. I guess I'll have to call you by your new names too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What should I call you then?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Miss Punnit Rick&quot; Alice said pointing at Karen. She then pointed at Rick and said &quot;And you young lady will call me Mom. Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss... I mean Mom&quot; Rick said. &quot;This is going to take some getting used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Alice said. &quot;It's going to be a big adjustment for all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The weekend passed with many awkward moments including Alice explaining to her other children what had happened. Both Daisy and Stephanie had congratulated Karen and Rick on joining the transformed family. Denise had voiced her suspicion that every one of them would be transformed before everything is said and done. Rick was surprised that he felt good wearing Karen's clothes and he was looking forward to his new life. Another awkward moment was when Alice had bought a home pregnancy test for Rick. Alice had explained<br />
how to use it and then stood and watched him use it. The test had said that he wasn't pregnant and Alice had said that should they have sex again to use protection.<br />
<br />
Sunday he had to go to church. Afterwords Katie, Daisy, and Stephanie had begged him to play with them. He did have fun with them and just wished he had Karen's memories to help him.<br />
<br />
Monday morning came, the day Alice would be taking him and Karen to see Dr. Mezzner. Rick was wondering how she would be fixing things. From what Alice had said he guessed that Karen would be Alice's new son while his parents would get a daughter.<br />
<br />
He got up and dressed. He only had a little bit of difficulty but he was getting better at put his clothes on. He met Karen in the hall and together they went down to breakfast.<br />
<br />
When they sat down at the table Alice sat down pancakes, sausage, eggs, and toast before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat up you two&quot; Alice said. &quot;I'll go get the others up and get them down here for breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice was gone for only a few minutes and then she was back. &quot;So how do you like being a girl Karen?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it&quot; Rick said honestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you like being a boy Rick?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it better than I thought I would&quot; Karen said. &quot;I don't miss my old clothes at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you two have adjusted so well&quot; Alice said. &quot;It seems that our family can easily cope with these changes. Daisy adjusted within two days. Stephanie did it in about the same time. Now you two have in just as short of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad that it happened Mom&quot; Rick said. &quot;I'll admit that I had been curious about what it would be like to be a girl. Now that I know I don't want to go back to being a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad to hear that&quot; Alice said. &quot;It just makes me sad that you won't be my daughter any more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been thinking about that&quot; Karen said. &quot;We switched bodies so our dna is now different. With Daisy she used a pair of Katie's undies so she was still a member of the family even though her dna was changed. Stephanie's dna was changed only enough to make her a seven year old girl. With us our dna was totally changed like Daisy's was. The difference is that we're from separate families. I now have Rick's dna and he has a different mother and father. So<br />
we'll be switching families. So I won't be your son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's sad either way&quot; Alice said. &quot;I enjoyed having all girls. I'll still have that but I'll be losing you with your reasoning.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time the rest of Alice's daughters had come down to eat and the rest of breakfast was spent in silence.<br />
<br />
After breakfast Alice gathered everyone up and got them in the van.<br />
<br />
As they approached Dr. Mezzner's office Rick said &quot;I remember this building. I found the medallion near here and I walked past here after I found it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same with me&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought so&quot; Alice said. &quot;I'm willing to bet that one of the medallions will show up here in a few months and it will make it's way to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So who will be next to be transformed?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll know when it happens&quot; Alice answered.<br />
<br />
They were quickly shown into an examination room like the previous times though this one had two examination tables in it.<br />
<br />
Soon two doctors came in, a man and a woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice to see you Alice&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nice to see you again Dr. Mezzner&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please call me Hanna&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;I have this funny feeling that we'll be seeing each other more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have that same feeling&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Dr. Wheeler&quot; Hanna said indicating the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you do?&quot; Dr. Wheeler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As well as can be expected&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the admission form you indicated that your daughter and her boyfriend switched bodies&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's correct&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's a simple enough procedure then&quot; Hanna said. &quot;All we have to do is copy their memories over to the other then suppress their original memories. They will still remember who they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have what transformed them?&quot; Dr. Wheeler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The medallion was taken shortly after during a power outage&quot; Alice said. &quot;It was taken right out of my hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had one of the medallions again?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we did&quot; Alice said. &quot;And it wasn't replaced this time so I'm guessing it was someone from the brotherhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You told them about the brotherhood?&quot; Dr. Wheeler asked. &quot;How stupid can you be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as stupid as you apparently&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you mean by that?&quot; Dr. Wheeler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She means that you just inadvertently outed yourself as a member of the brotherhood&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
Dr. Wheeler turned white and said &quot;Shit, we're not suppose to reveal ourselves. This complicates matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it doesn't&quot; Hanna said. &quot;They already know that I'm a member and they haven't said anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as long as they keep their mouths shut there's no need to tell the rest of the brotherhood&quot; Dr. Wheeler said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They more than likely know about it now&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I believe that they have this place bugged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww shit&quot; Dr. Wheeler swore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get in trouble for not being able to retrieve the medallion from me?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; Hanna said. &quot;The leaders have said for us to let you keep the medallion that comes your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering why the medallions kept finding us&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be the will of Zulo&quot; Dr. Wheeler said.<br />
<br />
&quot;For what purpose we don't know&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Alright, let's get the exams done.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Hanna had examined Rick and Dr. Wheeler had examined Karen they placed helmets on their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;No this won't hurt but you may have a feeling of vertigo during and shortly after the procedure&quot; Hanna explained.<br />
<br />
Rick was able to tell when it had began when the vertigo hit him. Karen's memories flooded into him while his own memories grew dim. After a few moments Rick, now Karen felt the helmet removed from her head. As she sat up her breakfast almost made an encore appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take it easy&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Just lay back down for a few minutes until the vertigo passes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While we have some time I need to know&quot; Alice said. &quot;Is Karen pregnant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No she isn't&quot; Hanna said. &quot;She didn't even conceive. According to the readings she won't ovulate for three more days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Hanna, that takes a load off my mind&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet that you're not ready to be a grandma yet&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
When the vertigo passed they said goodbye and headed to a restaurant for lunch.</p>
