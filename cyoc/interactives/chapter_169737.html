<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When his bodily needs are fulfilled, and he wasn&#39;t being commanded to do field work for a slave-driving farmer of which he has yet to experience, Jeff finds he is mostly free to wander around the field. His new home, of which he has no clue where it&#39;s even located. Like right now,  for instance. <br />
<br />
Jeff has discovered he has control over his body again,  rather than just his unintelligible aninal brays. He is able to walk around. The ground barely registering through his newly shod hooves. He&#39;s tired of being stuck on all fours,  and without proper hands. He makes a couple of unsuccessful attempts to stand on his hind legs,  but its physically uncomrfortable as his new physiology strains mightily to rear up,  just to be pulled back into his new natural four-legged stance. <br />
<br />
While his body is uncomfortable trying to stand on two legs,  his human mind is uncomfortable and embarrassed being forced on all fours, and helpless to any anything about it. He is now at tbe mercy of the body of his new species <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh......hhhhaaawww!!&quot; He attempted to speak out of frustration,  realized once again he can&#39;t even talk,  and hawwed back out. <br />
<br />
&quot;This sucks!&quot; He hawed outwardly. Mentally feeling &quot;cramped,&quot; struggling to stay calm. The &quot;cramped&quot; or &quot;trapped&quot; feeling stemming from several sources, all of already covered:<br />
<br />
1) He has no fingers. He mentally wants to spread them out,  and flex them. But with just hard hooves, that&#39;s quite impossible. Jeff continues to struggle with this fact. Each time he mentally tries to flex his fingers and fails, he is greeted with a stiffening of his donkey penis. Which only serves to make him more self-conscioys and uncomfortable. And at times, kicks his donkey instincts to take control of his body in the attempt to mate with another donkey. One that actually IS a naturally-born stupud brute. <br />
<br />
2) Being stuck in his four-legged position like the vast majority of other species. No longer will he ever experience the ability to walk upright.<br />
<br />
3) His inability to articulate actual speech out loud. <br />
<br />
There are even times where he forgets the actual shape and furriness of his body. Until he looks backwards across his own flank, which reminds him with inevitable dread that he&#39;s stuck with the barrel-shaped gray-coated body of a donkey! <br />
<br />
Currently, the image of what he is stuck as,  and tbe oppressive limitations of his form is strongly imprinted on his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaawww!&quot; he brays outward uncomfortably, <br />
 as his dick is hardening with this reality. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrgghhh....&quot; he breaths in....&quot;hhhhhaaawww&quot; his snelly breath breaths out lacking the words he knows should form upon escaping his thick,  black,  rubbery donkey lips. The refusal of his vocals to play out his thoughts increasing his libido.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghhh hhhaaww!&quot; His vocal chords continually refusing intelligent words he knlws are there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww ...eerrrgghh hhhaaww....eerrrgghh hhhaawww...&quot; He repeats over and over again in the forever futile attempt to speak,  stuck in his fingerless hooved fourlegged, barrel-shaped posture. The world ignoring the plaintive cries of a common jackass donkey. <br />
<br />
His sexual desire builds up and up. This is the point where Jeff would jerk off to the horrific idea of imagining what it would actually be like to be stuck permanantly as a donkey. But his fingerless front left hoof makes it impossible to grab onto his stiffening pole. The reality of actually BEING stuck permantly as a donkey is driving him beyond any of his imaginings!<br />
<br />
Suddenly,  the power is seized from his body as his donkey instincts are switched on. He starts releasing disgusting-smelling pheromones that would make him gag as a human. And his bidy under its own command, goes seeking a female. Or a male. Or a horse. Or a cow. At this point,  his body doesnt care! Jeff&#39;s mind can only bray in dismay as he suddenly loses control. <br />
<br />
He finds himself wandering towards tbe closest group of animals. A cow,  completely covered in mud. A strong odor of piss spraying out of his back end from its uplifted tail. His body seizes its opprtunity!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. Oh no! A cow? A COW!? At least let me have something thats my own species, &quot; he thinks,  as his humungous black donkey dick found its home right after latching onto the sides of the random large farm animal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gawd, &quot; his human mind thinksas he begins humping it. His underside being coated witg the same much that has coated that cow all day. His white belly fur turning a heavy wet brown,  to match the rest of the bovine herd. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhaaww eerrgghh hhaaww eerrgghh hhhaawww!!&quot; Jeff cried out with each hump,  white the cow just stood still,  stupidly paying no mind to what he was currently doing to her,  and paying no heed to tbe fact that tbey are two cometely different incompitable species.<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel the gallons of thick cum pooling at the base of his dick,  ready to shoot forth. When suddenly, the cow he was helplessly and disgustey trying to mate with,  let forth with another powerful stream of urine, at the same time the first jet of his yellowish male donkey cum spewed out. <br />
<br />
The cow&#39;s heavily-scented nuclear-yellow urine coated his entire underside. But still,  he kept cumming! Three,  four,  five more pumps! Six! SEVEN! His mind an explosion of fireworks as he heaved and hawed,  and thought about how he is now officially a filthy farm aninal,  helpess ti even clean himself<br />
<br />
As it finally,  mercifully,  came to a close,  he began to dismount the cow he had horrifically just fucked. Tbe cow&#39;s anus opened up with several large fresh &quot;PLOPS&quot; that his front hooves just landed in! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hheerrgghh hhhaaww!!&quot; Jeff wanted to cry. At this point, his deviant fantasy would come to an end as he would pull himself up from his bedroom floor and hit the toilet and the shower. Instead, he comes crashing back down to all fours on his hooves! Smashing a fresh green steaming pile of cow shit with what should be hands. His own cum dribbling out from her behind,  and with one more squirt,  coated his neck fur in cow urine and his own cum. <br />
<br />
He brayed out in defiance one last time,  as he noticed his head dipping down and jaw opening wide. His big,  thick,  slimy donkey tongue comes rolling out,  as he caught a large clump of wet,  muddy,  urine-soaked grass with some cow shit for extra spice in between his large,  greenish-yellow half-rotten blocky donkey teeth. He started grinding the greenery into a pukish green mush to be swallowed. His large slimy tongue stained green. <br />
<br />
He brayed once,  before his head dipped for another bite. His body&#39;s needs to nourish itself shutting him up. His head raised for more chewing. He started to bray again,  when his head dipped for another bite of sweet and sour grass. And on and on it went,  as Jeff was grazing as a filthy farm animal covered in mud, stinking piss, and cow manure stuck to the bottoms of his hooves. His donkey body ignoring it,  his hunan mind trapped inside more uncomfortable as than it&#39;s ever been. Wondering when this disgusting and physically-limiting nightmare would be over. He knew it never would be. He&#39;s stuck permantly as a filthy god damn DONKEY!</p>
