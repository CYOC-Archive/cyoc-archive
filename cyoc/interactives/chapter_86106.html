<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob:<br />
 A 17 year old guy living in a small apartment in London, though he used to live in the US and still has an american accent. He&#39;s short (5&#39;2) with some muscle from his job as a U-Haul employee. Jacob has curly blond hair grown with a messy bedhead style.  <br />
<br />
Catrina: <br />
 A 20 year old cat-human hybrid who is very intelligent, and acts rather regally and quiet, though she&#39;s never a snob. She&#39;s very thin, with dark blue hair that&#39;s grown down to her bellybutton. Catrina has cat ears that had replaced her human ones, and a cat tail (both are also dark blue in color). She has a small human nose and lips, and her height is around 5&#39;4. Catrina has a small butt and breasts around the B-C cup category, and cat teats below her waist. Her hips are wide and noticeable. Catrina has a british accent.<br />
<br />
Daracha:<br />
 A rather grumpy 18 year old dragon-human hybrid. Her height towers at 7&#39;1, and she has long red wings. Her skin is covered with polished green scales from her waist up, the rest is human skin. Her face is slightly shaped like that of a dragon, but still retains long, hazelnut brown hair. Daracha&#39;s breasts are also plated with scales, and has nipples that are a dark green color. Her butt is humongous, looking disproportionate to the rest of her body. Daracha prefers to walk around with no clothes on, even in public. <br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
(Daracha&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
To think I would be surprised when that &#39;&#39;Sarah&#39;&#39; lady brought me to Jacob&#39;s house. After all of the initial shock from him that I was now a dragon-human hybrid, Jacob acted perfectly normal around me and even gave me a towel to hide my nudity, though it was far too small to cover much, and I could see that he was trying hard not to stare. But I appreciated the thought.<br />
<br />
Sarah was drinking tea in Jacob&#39;s living room. There was an awkward pause as she took a loud sip, and then said to Jacob...<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;All right, cousin. Looks like the A-Virus is spreading somewhat quicker than I expected around here. I&#39;ll need you to watch Daracha too now.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;-yes&#39;&#39; said Jacob quickly. I felt warm inside that he liked me that much -- even in my new state.<br />
<br />
But...&#39;&#39;too?&#39;&#39; Was Jacob watching another A-Virus victim? I&#39;d have to ask him later, since there was nobody else around other than Sarah and Jacob.<br />
<br />
I got up from the sofa and hugged him, but the towel fell off of me and Jacob had a face full of dragon tits, but I kept the hug going anyway.<br />
<br />
I knew then that I could make a move on him, and that I&#39;d make one soon.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
(Jacob&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
Alright, since Catrina and Daracha started living with me, life became a lot better. The two get along really well, too. And it doesn&#39;t hurt to have two women under the same roof, but I honestly found the whole, &#39;&#39;hybrid thing&#39;&#39; to be really hot. I&#39;m able to see Catrina&#39;s teats from her blouse. Plus, I guess Daracha&#39;s changes made her want to become a nudist, since most of her old clothes couldn&#39;t fit her anyway. Call me a pervert, but I couldn&#39;t help but stare at Daracha&#39;s ass when she walked by me.<br />
<br />
But the two girls still brought a big problem to me; my tiny apartement could barely fit me in there before, but with the three of us (and with one who&#39;s a seven foot tall dragon) it became real difficult to find some room. Catrina had to sleep in the guest bedroom, and Daracha had to sleep on the couch. All in all, we needed more space to make it liveable, since I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d be leaving here anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I decided I&#39;d need my cousin Sarah&#39;s advice, since was the one who brought those two in the first place. I took my car, and Catrina joined me, with her usual disguise that hid her cat features. I knew Daracha couldn&#39;t come along, she was way too noticeable with her green skin and unusual height.<br />
<br />
We arrived where at the building where Sarah worked (at least, that&#39;s the address she gave me in case I needed help) and asked the receptionist to meet her. He escorted us to Sarah&#39;s office, who was reading a document with a bored look on her face. As always, she was wearing a camo military uniform. <br />
<br />
Catrina gave her a smile. &#39;&#39;Hullo&#39;&#39; she said.<br />
<br />
Sarah looked up. &#39;&#39;Oh, hi. Something you two need?&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
I told her about my overcrowded apartement, and how we needed a bigger place to live if  we were to make this work.<br />
<br />
Sarah snorted. &#39;&#39;Yeah, I&#39;ll help. Anything to keep me away from all of this fucking paperwork. Come with me.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
She began muttering something about how she doesn&#39;t get into the field much anymore, or something like that. We followed her, and she led us to room filled with computers. For some reason, the place was empty. Sarah instantly brought up a picture of a house -- or a mansion, it seemed. But it looked dirty and unkept.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;This is an mansion a little ways out of town. In one of my cases, the owner was murdered and the place was abandoned for a while now. He had no family, so nobody was able to claim it&#39;&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;But...&#39;&#39; she reached in her pocket and handed me a deed. &#39;&#39;You can move in that mansion for free; if you&#39;d be able to fix it up&#39;&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Oh my, that sounds lovely!&#39;&#39; beamed Catrina.<br />
<br />
We returned to my apartment a little later. Daracha was on the couch, watching some TV. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Hey&#39;&#39; said Daracha in a bored tone.<br />
<br />
I told her of our plans to move into a run-down mansion, and immediately some interest entered her voice.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Sounds like a sweet deal to me&#39;&#39; she finally replied.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
(Catrina&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
The next day we packed our things and headed for the address given to us by Sarah. Oh, I felt very sorry for Daracha, since she had to lay down on the back of the car in order to not be seen as an A-Virus victim. <br />
<br />
We drove for about half an hour until the mansion came into view. Despite being slightly run-down, it looked quite massive and impressive from the outside. The inside wasn&#39;t much worse. Daracha whistled when we entered the giant hall. The three of us seperated to explore all of the various rooms in the home.<br />
<br />
What I found was very interesting. There was a huge library, a kitchen (the kind professionals use), a dining hall with a working fireplace, a metal shop, a spacious garage, a trophy room, an art room to name a few. There was also a back yard that was quite lovely, with a hedge garden, a swimming pool, what looked like hot springs, a tennis court, an empty stable and a path that led into the forest. I was very impressed by it all.<br />
<br />
We met up by the dining hall and Jacob said, with a smile, that he could probably fix all of the run-down parts of the mansion. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;That sounds fantastic!&#39;&#39; I replied, giving him a hug.<br />
<br />
We unpacked all of our things and began fixing up the mansion on the next day. I had to say, the bed in my new room was rather comfortable.<br />
<br />
Jacob found a number of tools in the back of the shed, and we renovated. For the next week or so, the three of us cleaned, built upon, painted and changed whatever needed. Jacob did most of the work, since Daracha and I had little to no experience in handiwork. By the end of the week, a large portion of the tasks had been finished (at least, what the three of us needed to live a comfortable life there).<br />
<br />
I brought Jacob a pile of wood for the shed he had been fixing. I saw him rub the sweat out of his brow.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Thanks, Catrina. I think that&#39;s all for today&#39;&#39;.<br />
<br />
He squeezed me shoulder, and I found myself blush. Once he left, a strange sensation swept through my body, and my cat instincts took over as I began purring.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
(Jacob&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
I felt glad that all the day&#39;s work was done, so I jumped on the fluffy living room couch and drifted asleep, my body aching from the renovating.<br />
<br />
I was woken up a few hours later by the sound of Daracha calling me. I got up and followed the sound. Daracha was in her room, layed down on her bed with a seductive look on her face. She turned around to give me a view of her bubble butt, and her reptilian tail slowly swinged back and forth.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Hey there, big boy&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;You sure helped us out by moving here&#39;&#39;.<br />
<br />
Daracha got up and walked towards me, her hands on her hips. She put her arms around me and lowered her face.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;That deserves a reward... wouldn&#39;t you say?&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
I gulped. I&#39;ve obviously had a crush on Daracha, but this felt a tad too fast for me. She pulled my body to her&#39;s and kissed me. <br />
<br />
Daracha pushed me onto her large bed while kissing me passionately. Her heavy, half-dragon body was nearly crushing me, and I was in serious pain. Normally I would&#39;ve loved to make out with my ultra-hot best friend, but I could barely gasp for breath. I tried to say something, but Daracha just began kissing me again, totally ignoring that I had any problems.<br />
<br />
I knew then that if I could&#39;ve get her off of me soon, that would be the end. I thought quickly over what to do... <br />
<br />
As if it was instinctive, I grabbed one of her horns by the hand and pulled. Instantly she yelped and loosened her grip on me.<br />
<br />
By then, I was just about to lose conciousness, and Daracha noticed that something was wrong. My vision faded to black as she yelled my name in worry.</p>
