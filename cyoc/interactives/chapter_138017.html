<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Let’s see here,” Kat murmured to herself with a grin still playing with the corners of her mouth. “Whatever will I find here on my ex-brother’s iPad...” Her finger worked over the touch screen, flicking through the manipulated browser history. She tipped the screen, letting Jan look on with her as they searched for the first piece of evidence against Dan. <br />
<br />
He could only wait, with his arms still locked behind him and the woman towering above, for what Kat would lay against him and what she’d do in response. His chest felt tight and hot, ashamed he was so easily subdued and captured by these two, the weakest beings in his family! But really, they’d locked him under their will, so perhaps he wasn’t as tough as he thought. <br />
<br />
“What’d she pretend I wrote, huh?” Dan thought to himself, still annoyed and confused about what they had planned for him. He just stared up at her with a distant expression, looking distantly bored. “When will this game be over?” He wondered. <br />
<br />
“What’s this?” Kat’s finger paused, hovering over an interesting line. She gave a little cough, clearing her throat. “HateForums.com/RantItOut/LactatingCows...” A long, sighing breath left her lips before she tapped, skimming down for DanTheMan’s comments. <br />
<br />
“Dan, really? You think it makes you more manly to come on some site with that name? Are you really so insecure?” Her eyes roamed over his bare chest for a moment while a bemused smile curled up her lips. “I don’t know why I’m surprised...” <br />
<br />
He rolled his eyes, “Uh huh, yeah. I’m such a weakling... ha ha.” He thought to himself, trying to ignore her mocking, keep a distant between her insults and himself. Though, he couldn’t help but feel the chill in the air settling over his bare skin and the heat speckling down his chest with the embarrassment of being so exposed. <br />
<br />
Every glance down at him, from where they stood above, he felt a small fluttering in his gut as they saw his bare cock sitting between his thighs. <br />
<br />
Her finger tapped onto the link, opening his comments and skimming through the forum as they chattered back and forth sharing photos of woman lactating and breastfeeding at the mall, mocking them. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know where feminists get it in their heads to try and “change the world” they are just around to provide milk! They are just fat cows for milking-” Dan started to roll his eyes, knowing that his sister had to have planted all that stupid commentary. “I would never waste time writing that shit!” He tried to say, but Jan just glared him back into silence, “Don’t interrupt your sister! At least pretend to have some respect!” <br />
<br />
“God,” Kat shook her head with disgust. “It’s all the same shit. We’re cows. We’re useless. Lactating women should stay home and leak... photoshopped images...” She looked at him, eyes bright with anticipation. “Dan, maybe you should be the one experiencing this, huh? How would it feel to have tits aching with milk, hoping for someone to come empty them?” <br />
<br />
“Pssh- leaking is for people‘s sisters,” Dan thought, rolling his eyes at her threats. <br />
<br />
She stepped closer to him, her breath tickling the top of his head. “How would it feel to have your nipples tingling and sensitive all the time?” Her finger ran down his neck, tweaking one of his bare, exposed nipples so that it stiffened and jutted out. Her nails caught the skin, leaving a faint white line on his bare skin that tingled even as her fingers retreated. He felt a flare of heat from her teasing touch as his teeth grit back, irritation flaring. <br />
<br />
She just sneered, knowing he couldn’t do a thing about it. His wrists wiggles against his bonds while the ropes dig into his flesh, reminding him he was locked in place, right into his place. “What if you had that weight pulling on your chest all the time? Hanging down from you? Weighing on you?” <br />
<br />
Her eyes focused on him, narrowing slightly as she leaned into the magic she’d just gotten her hands on as his nipples started to go more and more tingly from the touch of her tweaking fingers. He could feel the air on them, swirling around the engorged flesh. <br />
<br />
“Is she doing that?!” Dan found it hard to believe Kat could really wield magic, even now after seeing it before. <br />
<br />
Then, with a smirk, she adjusted her spell which was completely invisible to him until moments later, his chest started to swell, giving him a heft against his chest of slightly breasts swelling into his pectorals. <br />
<br />
At first, he didn’t notice. He thought it was still just the tingling of his tweaked nipple radiating down some sort of elevated sensation, but then his eyes caught the sight of his chest below his chin and the size caught him off guard. Sure enough, he was swelling bigger! “W-what?! What is this!?”<br />
<br />
“Huh, Dan? Should I give you some tits and send you to the mall? Maybe a dribble of lactation?” On queue, his nipples swelled bigger to the size of a pregnant woman’s ready to deliver milk. They were thick, girthy and pink and raised from his chest with a darkening areola, looking more and more like the tits of a photoshopped, overemphasized pregnant woman than a young man! She raised a brow, as if to reiterate her question. <br />
<br />
“Want to feel what it’s like to drip and dribble? Hmm? Would you find sympathy from your fellow assholes? Someone to “drag you home and lock you up where you belong, dripping into a bowl?”” She stood over him, shadowing his face with her height as his chest continued to swell, giving him A cups and then B cup breasts. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I should slow the changes, untie you and free you into your day and let the changes happen slowly? Send you to the mall only for you to find your chest is getting more and more sensitive with each minute and your nipples are rubbing and chafing to the fabric, growing firm.” She was grinning, standing above him and painting this scene to unfurl into his mind. <br />
<br />
“A friend would tweak it, grab at the sensitive nub through the shirt. “What’s got you going, Danny Boy? Thinking about Maddy, haha!” But, his grabbing would make it spurt! Milk shooting out against your shirt, staining it and soaking through! “What the fuck, man? You’re squirting at me? What are you, a fucking lesbian? A leaking bitch? A milky cow?” They’d all be laughing, yelling, mocking you right there in the open.”<br />
<br />
“T-they wouldn’t do that to me!” Dan thought, trying to convince himself more than anything. He knew they would! They’d throw him out of the group faster than he could say boo. He’d be a freak. <br />
<br />
“Mothers passing by would either stare on with horror at some boy trying to leak like them or maybe one would come help, give you a nappy to soak up your leaking titty with...” She gave his other nipple a nipple, kneading it into his growing breast for a second. “Would that make you sympathic? To experience the plight of the cows?” <br />
<br />
“W-what is she doing?” Dan thought, starting to thrash as his eyes tilted down, watching as his chest became more and more obviously transformed, going from the thin, but defined pecs he had before to swollen, soft mounds beneath his chin. Pink of his deepening blush led the way down to where his chest was starting to swell out, visualizing his embarrassment for them to see. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Dan-” Jan chuckled, snickering a little. “Should I help you go pick out a bra? I never thought you’d need that, but alas. You clearly do.” His mother chuckled a little, trying to hide the smile that was breaking over her face with amusement as his horrified expression. <br />
<br />
“My mom? She can’t laugh at this! At this abuse!” Dan thought, looking up at her, feeling his cheeks growing ever hotter while his nipples tingled in the air, exposed and vulnerable. <br />
<br />
“But it’s not enough to just transform you into a man with tits, where’s the fun in that? You compared women to cows! You deserve more than just some breasts you can hide under a sweatshirt and keep on with your day!” <br />
<br />
“Besides, he’s a pervert...” Jan sighed. “What if he just enjoyed it? Having some of his own to... ya know?” Her daughter nodded, soberly in agreement. <br />
<br />
“I-I would not!” Dan’s mind was racing, railing against there mocking. He thought for a moment of his friends’ laughter if he showed up with tits. <br />
<br />
“Uh moo! Danny has got some milky bags now, huh?! Always said you ate too much!” <br />
<br />
“Lemme tweak a nipple!”<br />
<br />
“Hey! Now we can all practice our moves on Danny’s knockers!” <br />
<br />
Kat stamped her foot on the ground. “I think maybe you need to be an actual cow.”</p>
