<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">n&#39;t know what my obsession was with this fetish. I had an overworked imagination of the horrors of turning into a donkey. It both terrified and sexually aroused me at the same time. I had become obsessed with the concept. So much so, that I had gone out and &quot;borrowed&quot; an entire donkey costume.<br />
<br />
It would actually transform your body fully into that of a donkey once you put it on. More like, crawled inside of it. The thing was unbearably thick and unmanageably large, heavy, and dense. <br />
<br />
It had come with a nicely written professional letter explaining that it was a 1 time trial. It would last a full 24 hours, then you needed to return the thing. If you put it on a second time without fully paying for it....well.... You&#39;d be stuck to an entire life on all fours. Never again to have the privilege of a nice human body and identity. <br />
<br />
Well. I did try it once, not really believing it would actually work. Much to my horror, it did work! I found myself suddenly stuck to all fours with four legs and hooves! My body was bloated and inflexible! I was all covered in grey fur. My head was long and broad, my nose huge and black. My ears tall up on my head and wide. I had a relatively poor eyesight, but an excellent sense of smell and hearing. I even felt what it was like to actually have a tail! But most intense of all, was the sexual release from having a HUMUNGOUS hunk of male donkey meat between my four legs! <br />
<br />
I remembered reading it would only last for 24 hours as a one-time test run. But the longer I remained as a that stupid ass donkey, the more I began to question the &quot;rules&quot; of that letter. Luckily, I did leave it within easy &quot;reach&quot; for a donkey. Meaning, I didn&#39;t need to have hands to open a drawer or reach up to grab it. I just simply left it on the kitchen table lying face up. All I had to do, was &quot;clip-clop&quot; my way over to it. Unfortunately......I found out ... I couldn&#39;t fucking READ it! Besides the fact that my eyesight was not meant for reading fine print to begin with, what I could make out was just so e confising and meaningless shape-blobs!<br />
<br />
That sent me into another panic-driven sex drive! Dies this mean that the written word would be denied to me as long as I remained in this god damned limiting form!? I already couldn&#39;t fucking speak! God,I wished I could read that fucking letter again! <br />
<br />
(&quot;Ok....24 hours, then&quot;) I told myself. (&quot;24 hours!&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAaaawww,&quot; I breathed out in frustration as I felt that damned dick of mine beginning to demand attention again! Which I tried ignoring. But the fact that was just.....STUCK as this dirty disgusting oversized four legged farm animal with a way oversized male donkey dick, made that impossible. Nothing about me felt at all human! I was nothing but a fucking donkey, and all the senses sent from all the body parts as well as my quadruped position I was forced to remain in, screamed nothing but DONKEY! <br />
<br />
And so, for a third time, I had to get down on the floor and awkward hump it till I released yet another mess all over the floor! <br />
<br />
Well, I did spend my entire 24 hour period as a donkey in my own home. A most unpleasant experience. I was ravenously hungry near the end, but managed to somehow will myself to remain in the living room but for that one venture into the kitchen to try to re-read that letter. I had already decided that I would get myself brand new carpeting. Might as well leave the rest of my bodily messes contained to one room for when I would be physically capable of cleaning up after myself again. I didn&#39;t want to go into my kitchen and try to somehow get into and eat food. Not as a disgusting fucking donkey. making me nauseous. Living with the slimy, disgusting DNA of donkey snot and saliva was bad enough already. I didn&#39;t want my disgusting donkey mouth all over everything. <br />
<br />
The entire time I was bored, but managed to doze off and sleep for large chunks of that 24 hours. I had to be a no-call, no-show from work on the following Monday. I couldn&#39;t even work a phone. All I&#39;d manage to do would be to smash it with a large clumsy hoof. I couldn&#39;t even talk anyway. All I could do was make the harsh, irritating, obnoxious, and humiliating noises that only donkeys can make. <br />
<br />
The following day, around noon, I FINALLY turned back into a human! I felt my skin and thick fur detaching, and I physically collapsed, completely inside of a large, horrendous-smelling, hot, humid, and somehow slimy fur suit! <br />
<br />
Breathing heavily and half panicking, I thrashed about inside of it. Finally finding the sweet open hole on its belly, I kicked and shoved my way out into the fresh air of my house!<br />
<br />
Well.... Relatively fresh air anyway. FINALLY able to stand up on two legs, I was heaving heavily. Rapidly checking out my now-human pink-skinned naked body! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....oh thank God!&quot; I said aloud. Flexing and stretching my fingers!!!!<br />
<br />
Very first thing I did, was run right upstairs to the shower! A long, hot shower! Brushed my teeth till they bled, and washed it out with a lot of mouth wash! God, that was disgusting. So much so, I nearly hurled. And a really terrible experience overall. <br />
<br />
The limitations of physically being a donkey was horrifying. The thought of being stuck like that, stuck forever with the body of a donkey, was the stuff nightmares were made of. Just. Being stuck to all fours. Any attempt at standing upright on two legs only lasts a few brief moments before your physiology forces you back to all fours. Worst of all, were the fucking HOOVES! <br />
<br />
On top of it, the humiliation. The degraded position of being nothing but a dirty old farm animal meant only for plowing a bunch of old Amish farm fields. Of only being stuck outdoors. Huge tall ears and a tail always present and marking you for what you are. Gigantic big black make genitalia always exposed and always erect. Nobody knowing you are an intelligent being, no way to let them know you are, and.....would you even WANT anyone to know that you are the one behind those big brown eyes? Better to make everyone think you are just a stupid beast. But still....talk about wasted human intelligence....<br />
<br />
I was constantly shaking and shivering, despite the relaxing hot shower. The images in my brain were constant. Me. As a filthy fucking DONKEY! Only stuck with a constant stream of braying.....<br />
<br />
Oh shit! My phone! It started ringing. Luckily I brought it into the bathroom with me and was within easy reach from the shower. Maybe it was my office&#39;s manager? <br />
<br />
I quickly shut off the hot water, and reached out for it. Sure enough, it WAS him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; I quickly answered.<br />
&quot;Yeah, Mike. It&#39;s me. Tim.&quot; <br />
<br />
(&quot;God how I hated how he always introduced himself. Yeah. I get it. Caller ID is a thing on smart phones in the 21st century.&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boss, what&#39;s up?&quot; (He hates being called &quot;boss.&quot; Makes me chuckle.&quot;) <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. We did have work today ya know. But because you were no-call no-show, you don&#39;t need to come in tomorrow. Or. You know. Ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re firing me!?&quot; I demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.... I prefer the phrase &quot;let go.&quot;<br />
<br />
(&quot;God, what a douche!&quot;) I thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;So....you don&#39;t even want to know what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah....no...&quot; *Click*<br />
<br />
Son of a bitch just hung up on me! <br />
<br />
Great. Now what was I going to do? Apply for unemployment I guess. Hang out as a donkey. I was  qualified to get another job as a business analyst.....<br />
<br />
Wait a second. &quot;Hang out as a donkey?&quot; Did that actually cross my mind!? No, fuck that! That was worse than working fur that doesn&#39;t douchebag! <br />
<br />
I sighed. I guess I&#39;ll have to get my unemployment process started....</p>
