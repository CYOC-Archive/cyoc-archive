<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To your amazement the box had a purse in it, when you picked it up you drop the pen and it rolls away, but you forget about your previous life. The pen rolls back to the magic shop......... until the next customer walks in then pay for the pen and walks home .....<br />
(Las) *is late for work and runs into someone* &quot;Hey&quot;<br />
(Zoa) &quot;Oof, sorry about that&quot; *a man with a goggles and a outfit pretty much saying adventurer looks at the person who bumped into him*<br />
(Las) *A man with a tuxedo and lots of files* &quot;no it&#39;s my fault&quot;<br />
(Zoa) *It&#39;s alright the goggled man walks off but finds something* &quot;hmm what&#39;s this?&quot; *It appeared to be a strange ring with a blue and pink gem inside*<br />
(Las) *As the tuxedo guy rushs to work he finds a pen in his files* &quot;where did this come form&quot; *shugs it off then gets to work and his boss coming up to him* &quot;hello&quot; <br />
(Boss) &quot;your fired&quot; *and gives him a note of fired then leaves*<br />
(Las) &quot;as if&quot; *then he scribbles on the page the words* &quot;no your fired&quot; *Then it actually happened*<br />
(Zoa) *When I walked down the road I&#39;m confused by the ring but remember the pen of reality I had and pat myself down looking for it but I realized I must of dropped it so I start heading in the direction the guy went hoping to find him*<br />
(Las) &quot;No way it worked&quot; *then he wrote i am a girl* &quot;my dream will come true&quot; *then he shrank and morphed* &quot;oh man i ment woman whatever i can change it&quot; <br />
(Guy #1) &quot;what are you doing in here&quot; *then grabs her and pulls her out of the building* &quot;and stay out&quot; <br />
(Las) *very confused and scared starts to panic* &quot;what am i going to do now&quot;<br />
(Zoa) *I accidentally run into you making us fall down I grunt and start to get up I offer my hand to you* &quot;sorry&quot; *A piece of blank paper falls next to you*<br />
(Las) *Takes it* &quot;Oh it&#39;s ok&quot; *picks up the paper* &quot;whats your name&quot; <br />
(Zoa) &quot;Zoa sorry about that I&#39;m looking for someone who I ran into for, he must&#39;ve grabbed my pen of reality when we bumped into each other. Oh and ignore that thing I mentioned about a pen. need some help?&quot;<br />
(Las) &quot;My name is........natalie daisy thankz but am fine i hope you catch that guy in the tuxedo &quot; *walks off*<br />
(Zoa) &quot;Oh thanks&quot; *I&#39;m about to leave but I realize what she said and starts running after her* &quot;hey wait! How did you know that! Unless you used that pen!!&quot; *I managed to catch up* &quot;hey can you please give that pen back, you could do many things but you have no idea the dangerous power you possess!&quot;<br />
(Las) &quot;What are you talking about? I saw a man in a tuxedo running that way with a strange pen&quot; *starts crying* &quot;stranger danger!&quot; *All the people look over to you*<br />
(Zoa) &quot;What!! No I never said a guy in a tuxedo! I only said I was looking for someone! Please return it or at least let me tell you how to use it, please I don&#39;t need this kind of attention!&quot;<br />
(Las) *Stops crying* &quot;sorry but my life is at rock bottom&quot;<br />
(Zoa) &quot;Well then you now have the means to change that, with that pen you can do anything you want as long as you have some paper to write on, let&#39;s go somewhere more quiet so we don&#39;t cause a problem&quot;<br />
(Las) &quot;Oh cool, we can go back to my house&quot; *starts walking*<br />
(Zoa) *I began to follow* &quot;so you made yourself a girl? Well to let you know you can make changes mental and physical if your specific or you might not get exactly what you want&quot; <br />
(Las) &quot;I did indeed...&quot; *then stops as her dead mom is in the front yard* <br />
(Las mom) &quot;hi honey, have you seen my ring?&quot;<br />
(Zoa) &quot;Uhh do you mean this thing?&quot; *I hold up the ring*<br />
(Las mom) &quot;Thankz, who are you?&quot; <br />
(Las) *I pull out the paper and write down* &quot;my parents are out of town&quot; *then i walk inside* &quot;sorry about that but it was strange&quot;<br />
(Zoa) *I decided to ignore that for now* &quot;I&#39;m zoa a adventurer. I&#39;ve been traveling the world but only recently got that pen from a strange magic shop. I don&#39;t know why i chose it but I guess the situation from such a item is kind of funny to him. I haven&#39;t even used it yet myself I only know what it does is thanks to me being shown and told about.&quot; <br />
(Las) &quot;My real name is lost anime swvenge&quot; *goes inside then pulls out the paper then writes* &quot;zoa is back at the magic shop with his own pen forgeting this whole adventure, leaving my to do whatever i want&quot; *then watchs him fade and goes to sleep Then as she sleeps the pen vanishs And as she awakens* &quot;where is it&quot; <br />
(Las mom) &quot;we have to get to school&quot;<br />
(Zoa) *I&#39;m looking at the paper I wrote glad to have got her back for trying to make me forget as I wrote that she was a high school student that has a very horny boyfriend that they have sex twice a week or even more while she now is attracted to both guys and girls while being a grade A student, I remember because of the person who gave me the pen gave me my memory again saying its not allowed to have more then one pen so punishment is needed*<br />
(Las) *As she was pushed out the door she grabbed the ring* &quot;yoink&quot; *then she arrived at school and this guy walked up to her* <br />
(Mike) &quot;yo babe want to have some fun before class starts&quot; <br />
(Las) *she blushed in anger* &quot;i don&#39;t even know you&quot; <br />
(Mike) *he grabbed her arm* &quot;oh so role-playing is what you want&quot; *he pulled her off*<br />
(Las) &quot;please let me go.......on&quot; *as they made love she lost herself* &quot;ohhhhhh yaaaa!&quot; *Then she went off to her first class cheerleading and ran into some of her new friends* <br />
(Cheer captain) &quot;whats up?&quot; <br />
(Las) *To which she replied* &quot;the infinite universe&quot; *all her friends laughed and she blushed in apearestment* &quot;sorry it&#39;s a habit&quot; *then she went to her locker to get ready and spotted the ring and put it on out of curiosity* &quot;wait a minute this is my moms ring but it does look sexy&quot; *then the ring glow blue and the cheer squad stared yelling* <br />
(Cheer team) &quot;boy in the girls locker room&quot; *then beat him out of there* <br />
(Las) &quot;what was there problem&quot; *then looks down* &quot;I gotta get going to pe away&quot; *rush into the boy&#39;s locker room then over to the gym*<br />
(Couch) &quot;where you been son?&quot; <br />
(Las) *he thinks back* &quot;i don&#39;t remember sir&quot; *the couch lets him pass* <br />
(Couch) &quot;well your hear now&quot; <br />
(Mike) *then he sees his best bro* &quot;yo get over here&quot; *and they hug it out* <br />
(Las) &quot;lets do this&quot;<br />
(Zoa) *I then make it so she has to give a guy a bj once a day and everyone thought it was normal* &quot;that&#39;s going make sure my memory is avenged&quot;<br />
(Las) *His game of football turns into her game of blowing* &quot;yum yum more cum&quot; *then after that she asks* &quot;who next &quot;<br />
(Zoa) *I decided to visit her new self seeing if he&#39;ll get pleasure from her as well. as he walks through the entrance wondering were she is*<br />
(Las) &quot;Any one, its free!&quot; *Looks around*<br />
(Zoa) *I get to were she&#39;s at seeing her offer he tacked his pants off and underwear* &quot;I&#39;ll be next&quot; *I say with my &quot;little friend&quot; out ready for action*<br />
(Las) &quot;Get ready,for some fun&quot; *she grabs the dick and starts to stroke it as it gets closer to her mouth then puts her other hand in her mouth to get it wet finally she puts the dick in her mouth and uses her tongue to put the ring on it* &quot;got cha bitch!&quot; *As the ring glows pink*<br />
(Zoa) *I changed into a girl surprised at what happened seeing you holding a ring* &quot;uhh why are you right there are you going to eat me out slut?&quot;<br />
