<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim awoke from her drugged sleep when she felt the cold air that filled the room.  The warm liquid she had spent all night in slipped off her body and drained through the holes in the net she lay upon.  Two figures covered in heavy, full-body coats started wiping her down.  They used soft, rubber pads to squeegee the thick liquid from her body.  Clean water was fed from a hose and played over her body to make her clean.  Everything drained into the tub.  Kim figured the liquid was too precious to waste.  When she was clean, the net was shifted over the floor and lowered slowly to a soft pad.<br />
<br />
Kim felt exhausted and was almost unable to move.  It was as if she had just spent the last twelve hours doing full-body aerobics.  Her skin felt stiff and thick.  With great effort Kim lifted a hand so she could see.  Her fingers gleamed in the dull light.  A fragment of memory floated to the surface of her mind; she was young and had spilled white school-glue on her hand.  Kim had spread it all over her hand and let it dry.  It had pulled tightly on her skin when she tried to flex her fingers.  It had been glossy just like her hand was now.  She remembered how strange that had been.  The strangeness had been thrilling.  Especially when the glue started pealing off.  As she had teased the dry plastic from her fingers she had felt herself getting more and more excited.  It was a feeling she had never understood until now.<br />
<br />
Kim flexed her hand.  The muscles were tight and stiff.  The skin was smooth and glossy.  She could no longer see the fine hairs on the back of her hand.  The nanites had removed them while she slept.  She suspected that it was the same on the rest of her body.  Her hand was not much different from before but for the skin.  She thought about trying to peal it glossy right off.  She brought her other hand up; it too was glossy.  With one hand she tried picking at the back of the other hand.  Slowly she scratched but soon realized that there was nothing happening.  She could feel a dull round finger rubbing at her hand.  She could feel the smooth skin; it resisted moving or flexing like regular skin.  Her skin, though soft, was now more like plastic than flesh.  She took a closer look at her fingers noting that the hard nails had gone the way of her body hair.<br />
<br />
Kim tried to lean up onto her elbows.  The two men who had pulled her from the tub had lost their robes.  One was the smart looking doctor from yesterday.  The two were now examining her body.  The doctor was checking various things and reading measurements off of instruments.  The other was taking notes.  As their bobbing head parted Kim was able to see the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
She was smooth.  Completely smooth and her body had a sheen to it.  Her body was still flesh covered but it was so uniform in tone that it looked artificial.  She could not see any hair on her body.  Not even between her legs.  Her feet were also missing the nails on her toes.  She was naked too.  The robe she had worn into the tub was gone.  She expected that the robe was now part of the gloss that was adhered to her.  Under the skin her muscle tone was the same as it had been but the skin was so plain. She could see that her navel was now smoothed over.  If Kim had not spent hours in a tank of nanites she would have thought she were wearing the tightest garment she had ever seen.<br />
<br />
When the men were satisfied that Kim was not about to die the unknown man left to bring back a wheel chair.  The cute doctor took Kim up in his arms and lifted her gently into the chair.  Neither man talked to her or took notice that she was watching them.  They did not offer her clothing or blanket to cover up.  Kim was naked as they wheeled her through the halls.<br />
<br />
Kim was mortified that someone might see her naked form.  She wanted to hide her body but she still felt incredibly drained.  The stiffness seemed to have gotten worse since she had been removed from the tank.  Her limbs felt as though they were locking up.  Kim was unable to cover her bare body and the strangeness was causing those old feelings to rise up again.  From first seeing her hands, Kim felt a growing need between her perfectly smooth legs.<br />
<br />
Her eyes watered in the cool wind of the halls as she was pushed along.  She closed her eyes to prevent herself from crying.  That was when she realized that her eye-lids had been rendered transparent.  Kim blinked several times to confirm the fact.  She could see easily through clear eye-lids.  Kim wondered what life would be like if she was able to escape from the institute right now.  A clean, featureless, unblinking, doll-like woman walking the streets completely naked.  Where could she go that would not cause people to freak out?<br />
<br />
There was an elevator and then another hallway.  Kim was taken in to a small room where sun streamed through a window.  Kim was parked in the light.  The cute doctor came around to the front and squatted to look up and Kim.  Kim wanted to smile and tilt her head in a flirty way but was unable to move.  It would make no difference as the man did not seem interested in Kim as anything but the item she was turning into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now you feel entirely drained of energy.  That is normal.  The layer you have been coated in is actually a high-efficiency solar collector.  This light will re-energize you almost as if you have eaten a high-sugar meal.  Think of if like charging your batteries.&quot;  He smiled a delightful grin that Kim wanted to return.  &quot;Your immobility is normal, also.  It will fade as you sit.  But resist the desire to move out of the light.  I will return when it is safe to move again.&quot;<br />
<br />
He placed a hand on her knee.  It lingered a little long and Kim wished it would linger longer or do more that just sit there.  Then he rose and left.  Kim followed him as much as possible with her eyes before her immobile head caused her lose track.  She resigned to just sitting and feeding on the sun.  In its light her body gleamed gloriously.  It tingled pleasingly driving her arousal even higher.  Kim forced herself to remember the touch of the doctor.  Unable to move she had nothing else to do.</p>
