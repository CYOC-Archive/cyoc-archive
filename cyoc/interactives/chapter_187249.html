<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sometime later Sugar was carrying her spoilt owner into the grounds of an impressive mansion where she was directed towards a stable large enough to accomodate two horses for the night. After being allowed to eat some grain then drink some not as fresh or clean as she would have liked water from their respective troughs, Sugar was lead into a stall directly opposite a near identical one the male would be staying in. The only obvious difference was that the entrance to hers was painted pink and his blue, presumably to indicate their respective genders.<br />
<br />
As the mother left the chilly stables for the warm comforts of her house her daughter made an excuse to linger a while longer. Sugar guessed this would likely be to taunt her and she was correct.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Christina, sorry Sugar. I almost forgot your new name&quot; Cassie giggled cruelly as she stroked the mares mane &quot;I hope you didn&#39;t have any plans for the weekend as it looks like you are going to be my personal pet until Monday. I might even ask mother to make Jenkins an offer to buy you and keep you like this permanently. Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sugar felt sure that was an empty threat and decided it was best not to rise to the bait. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, it&#39;s cold and smelly out here. I&#39;d best get inside&quot; Cassie blew the unfortunate human turned mare a kiss before shutting the horses into the stables for the night.<br />
<br />
With so little room to move or options to do anything other than wait, Sugar was thankfully able to take advantage of her physical exhaustion and fell asleep for the rest of the night.<br />
<br />
Christina awoke to bright sunshine seeping through the cracks of the stable. She was still a horse, which made her worry that she would need Jenkins to turn back to normal.<br />
<br />
In the distance, she heard the sound of stable doors creaking open. Cassie walked in, dressed in riding gear yet again. <br />
<br />
“Hello there, Sugar!” Cassie greeted. “Turns out you’ll be with us all weekend, ain’t that great?” She smirked at Christina with an evil undertone to her words. <br />
<br />
“Now here on our farm, we take care of our horses, and we keep them well exercised. So that means another day of riding for a horse like you.” Cassie opened the door to sugar’s pin, and sugar walked out. <br />
<br />
“Hold on sugar, we’re not going by ourselves” Cassie opened the pin across from her, and out marched a tall and muscular stallion. It had black fur and a long luscious mane. Christina stared at the stallion for a moment, entranced, then broke her gaze when Cassie tugged on her neck. “Sugar this is a real horse, his name is rocky.” Rocky stepped forward towards Christina, sniffing her. “It looks like rocky likes you sugar. Careful, he might make a real horse out of you too.” Cassie said with an evil grin.<br />
<br />
Cassie rode Christina around in the field for an hour or two, and Rocky followed close behind. Eventually Cassie grew hot and tired, and she hopped off of Christina. “Sugar, I am parched, I’m going to go get some water, so you stay here and munch on some grass or whatever it is horses eat.” She said giggling to herself while walking off towards the house.<br />
<br />
Christina stood there, and grumpily decided to eat some grass. She still didn’t like eating dirty grass, but she was hungry and Cassie likely wouldn’t give her another chance.<br />
<br />
Christina started eating, but didn’t notice the stallion behind her getting closer. The stallion rubbed its side with Christina’s. Christina felt it brush past, it sent a tingle down her spine, but she forced herself to ignore it, convincing herself it was nothing. Rocky stick his head close to her tail, taking a deep whiff. The stallion smelt a mature mare, ripe to reproduce. <br />
<br />
Christina jerked upward instantly as she felt a shocking sensation coming from her behind. Rocky had started nipping at her vulva, almost as if he was playing with her. Christina was in shock, as she didn’t want this at all, but her new horse hormones were giving her a different message. She trotted a few feet forward to escape, but Rocky persisted. Each nip sent a jolt of pleasure through her body, which simultaneously terrified her. <br />
<br />
Christina wasn’t sure what to do. She was tired from running all morning with Cassie, so there is no way she had enough energy to escape. To Christina’s luck, she heard a voice from behind.<br />
<br />
“Oh sugar what do you think you’re doing?” Cassie walked fourth. This was the first time Christina was happy to see Cassie. “I told you that rocky likes you, y’all need to come with me.” Christina sighed in relief as Cassie dragged both of them back to the stables, where she would be safely separated from her aggressor. <br />
<br />
They arrived at the stable, where Christina was let in her pin. What she didn’t realize was that the gate didn’t close behind her. <br />
<br />
“Sugar, the rule is that daddy has last say on what horses get bred. I just asked him about you and rocky when I went inside, He thinks that you are just an average mature mare, and lucky you, he said yes to letting you guys breed!” Cassie said with a smile on her face. Christina’s heart sank as she watched rocky enter her pin, and Cassie closed the gate behind him. “Plus I figure, if your pregnant with a foal, you probably can’t turn back to human, then you get to be my horse forever, ain’t that great sugar?”<br />
<br />
Christina started shaking as Cassie walked away. “Like I said, rocky will make a real horse out of you!” She said as she closed the doors to the stables.<br />
<br />
Rocky went straight back to his aggressive tactics from before, nipping at the backside of Christina, who would soon be known only as sugar the horse. Christina had no where to go and no one to talk to, and eventually her horse vulva started to wet itself. The scent sent rocky into overdrive as he pushed forward and climbed on top of Christina. Rocky’s huge horse cock jammed forward into Christina’s cunt, sending shockwaves of pleasure through her body, and melding her mind to that of a mare in heat. Christina quickly gave in, and she sat there and took it like a mare for hours. Rocky thrusted and pumped over and over as Christina was filled with cum. <br />
<br />
This continued for most of the night, until rocky finally fell asleep. Christina fell beaten next to rocky, falling asleep next to him.</p>
