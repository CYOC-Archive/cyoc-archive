<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ted was a big guy. So it was only natural that he wanted to get bigger. He worked hard, after all, to reach this size. Countless hours of hard work at the gym or on the field to get where he was now. Still, just because he was bigger than most doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t room for improvement. Of course, at this point, this didn&#39;t register as a desire for the ring. Right now, it was just a random thought a teen had made. For it to be a desire, he would have to think about it a bit more...<br />
<br />
Ted&#39;s girlfriend, Natalie Simons, was waiting outside by the time he had driven up to her home. Once he pulled up, Ted admired his girlfriend as she walked to the car. Nat was pretty, fashionable, and popular. It was no wonder that she was dating a football player; everyone pretty much expected her to. Still, out of all the football players she could have dated, she chose Ted... (Right?) Anyway, once Natalie got in the car, Ted turned to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you said you got done with homework early, but you do remember I have to pick up Jack and Toby too, right? They may not be ready by the time we arrive, or was there some reason you wanted me to come by early?&quot; Natalie chuckled and then gave Ted a lustful look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe I just wanted to spend a little bit more time with my Teddy bear.&quot; Natalie placed her hand on Ted&#39;s stomach and started to work her way up. Oh, well, Ted knew where this was going. He quickly turned off the engine and wrapped his arms around Nat&#39;s much smaller body. Soon, the two began making out like most horny teenagers did when they were left alone in a car. Who knows how long this would last or how far it would go if it weren&#39;t for Natalie feeling the sensation of metal on her skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Wait!&quot; Natalie yelled, and two stopped. Natalie then took Ted&#39;s hand to find the ring, &quot;What is this? This better not be from someone else!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa. This isn&#39;t from another girl. This is from my uncle!&quot; Nat gave Ted a look. This time it wasn&#39;t a lustful one, &quot;No, really! He runs a curio shop, remember? Besides, do I look like I&#39;m stupid enough to wear another girl&#39;s ring when I&#39;m picking up my actual girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie held her look of disdain before turning away and sighing. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. You&#39;re not the type to wear jewelry anyway. Sorry.&quot; Though under her breath, Ted thought he could hear her say, &quot;But it&#39;s not girls that I&#39;m worried about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, now that the mood was killed. Guess it was time to drive to their next stop. On the way, Ted thought about how he could make this up to her. How he could make her happy. The large man remembered how Natalie called him her Teddy Bear. Maybe if he was a bit larger, sexier, things would be better. Naive thoughts for sure, but probably a mistake that many young people in one of their first serious relationships make. Still, that thought he had when he first left his house became something more. Was it desire now? Well, it was to the ring as it began working its magic.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
After a while, Ted pulled up to Toby&#39;s house, and despite coming a bit earlier than they planned to, Toby was thankfully ready to go. Toby was one of Ted&#39;s childhood friends who, at this point in his life, was trying to figure out where his place was in the world like most teens were. Having been influenced by Ted, Toby tried out for every sport, eventually landing on archery. Though as much as he enjoyed it, was this really a good direction for his life?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Toby!&quot; Ted greeted his friend. &quot;Ooh, what do we have here?&quot; Toby said he was going to bring food for the party, and Ted couldn&#39;t help but peak. &quot;Whoa, pigs in blankets? And these mini-sandwiches... Are all these handmade?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; Toby responded, &quot;You can thank my Mom, though. She really helped out when I was running behind schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, give my compliments to your Mom.&quot; Ted reached for one of the sandwiches, but Toby swatted his hand away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! If you eat one, you&#39;re going to end up eating ten. Leave some for the rest of us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if I want to break 300 pounds, I gotta eat.&quot; Needless to say, Toby did not let Ted eat before the party. Still, despite the fact that Ted was half joking, he was still half serious. His ring responded to this by working a bit faster as his desires were growing. <br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Nothing eventful happened while they were on the road to Jack&#39;s house. Well, except Toby frowning at the fact Natalie was with them, but Toby made sure not to let Ted see that. He didn&#39;t think that those two would last past high school and that Natalie wasn&#39;t right for Ted, especially after they broke up. Still, Natalie was making Ted happy right now, so who was he to say anything.<br />
<br />
When all of them arrived, they saw Jack struggling, trying to carry soda bottles and his guitar all at once. Jack was a musician and one of the school&#39;s heartthrobs. His long blond hair tied up in a ponytail, his slim figure, and his pretty yet masculine face made him very popular with the girls. Although despite that, Ted didn&#39;t recall Jack ever having a serious girlfriend. It made him wonder if Jack either didn&#39;t have the time for dating, was waiting for &quot;the one,&quot; or was playing for the other team, but Ted couldn&#39;t find the words to ask. In fact, Jack was one of the reasons why Ted became so curious about life on the other team, and his curiosity peaked again...<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, bro, let me help you with that.&quot; Fearing that Jack would drop everything, Ted was the one to get out of the car first to help his friend. He effortlessly carried the soda bottles leaving Jack with just the guitar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Ted, and sorry about that. Guess I should have waited for the residential strong man to come and help out, huh?&quot; There was a twinge of jealousy in Jack&#39;s voice when he said that. To be honest, Jack was jealous of Ted&#39;s strength and size, and maybe a bit more jealous about some other things about Ted...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t mind helping, besides I still have a ways to go before I&#39;m a strong man.&quot; Once more, as Ted&#39;s desire grew, the ring worked a bit faster to make those desires a reality. Ted took a moment to adjust his clothes before loading the soda bottles into his car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again, Ted. By the way, that&#39;s a nice ring. where did you get it?&quot; Jack asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this? I got it from my Uncle. He runs a curio shop and gave it to me for whatever reason.&quot; Hmmm, now that Ted looked at the ring again, was it shinier than it was before? Maybe Ted was misremembering things, but he did make a mental note of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I didn&#39;t know that. I like strange trinkets so maybe I&#39;ll look into visiting his shops one of these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before the group arrived at Seth&#39;s party. It seems like someone had edited together some highlights of the football games Ted&#39;s team had played. Ted and Natalie decided to sit down together to reminisce about those days long ago when Ted notice that his clothes seemed a bit tighter than usual.<br />
<br />
Ted excused himself and went to the bathroom to get a look. There he saw his body had changed.</p>
