<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man who walked into the barber shop was of medium build, height and non-descript looks. His suit was expensive but slightly old and rumpled. The wedding ring on his finger explained the bags under his brown eyes as much as the greying hair and the big sliver ‘people carrier’ BMW he had pulled up in. He didn’t shuffle into the shop but smoothed his black tie down and walked confidently up to the barber like the experienced salesman he was<br />
“Good morning” he said in a firm voice “do I need an appointment?”<br />
“Not here” the barber said back with a small smile. The suited man took a look around and smiled a nice even white toothed smile <br />
“Good. Nice to see an old fashioned barber shop, I hope your cuts are as good as the surroundings are traditional and wonderful” The barber waved towards a seat and slightly loosening his tie the gent walked over and sat down adjusting his position until he felt comfortable<br />
“Just a trim for me today- my wife and my boss would be unhappy if I came back with one of those ‘modern’ cuts……” he was cut off as the door opened another man came in.<br />
<br />
If the man in the chair was dressed conservatively then the man who came through the door was his polar opposite. Tie-dyed colours all over the rainbow clashed on his open shirt and surf shorts, the green T-shirt he was wearing had a huge peace sign on it. He was 5’ 9” and medium build; a wild brown-grey beard covered his chin and chest and his greasy hair was down to mid back. He wore John Lennon style round, rose coloured shades and had an easy, tobacco stained toothy grin on his face. <br />
“’sup dudes” he said in a lazy voice. He didn’t sound Californian but he’d certainly embraced the hippy culture some years back and was still living in the ‘60’s. He was certainly old enough; the sunken muscles and old blue eyes belayed his age.<br />
“Hullo” the man in the chair said simultaneously with the barber; the new comer laughed an easy laugh and walked down the shop running a hand through his beard<br />
“It’s got a bit wild man” he said to the barber “think you can do something with it hombre?” The barber nodded and pointed towards a chair. As he past the seated gent he suddenly stopped and stuck out a hand<br />
“Do I know you man? You look familiar?” The man in the suit shook his head <br />
“I don’t think so, though somehow I feel I do…..it is most odd. I’m James Hawk” he offered a hand and the two shook<br />
“I’m Bobby Port, also known as Thunderbeard” he laughed at his own name “Its so weird dude, it’s like I know you… where you at New York High?<br />
“No, I was an army brat- I kind of grew up all over until I settled down”<br />
“Wow that’s wild, I was heading for an army life until my dad died and I headed off into freedom” the hippy laughed and James laughed along. <br />
“So you in here for a shave and a haircut?” James asked. Bobby shook his head<br />
“No way dude! I’m never shave this off! I like being hairy! I’d have more if I could but I don’t grow hair much apart from on my head, I just need a clean up and the wilder bits tamed.” He smiled at the barber and took the chair<br />
“Sorry to keep you waiting man, but this dude is soo strangely familiar” the barber nodded<br />
“Sometimes my customers often seem to know each other” he said as he tried the cloth around Bobby’s neck. The Barber was actually surprised by these two customers, if he was right in his guess he’d found some kindred souls- two lost loves who should have always been together. <br />
<br />
The Barber tied the cloth round James neck as he observed<br />
“I always wondered what having that sort of hair would be like...” he mused towards Bobby<br />
“Never been able to grow a beard?” <br />
“No. Never been allowed. Army, work, wife. Not allowed one really”. <br />
“A shame man. I tell ya having lots of hair is cool. Fits my life”. <br />
“Oh?” James said titling his head. <br />
“Yeah. Freedom man. No bills, no mortgage. Live on the road. Live by my wits. Not many of us left now though so it does get a bit lonely.”<br />
“What do you do for cash?” James said as the Barber began to run his fingers through his well cared for hair. <br />
“Odd jobs here and there. Times are hard sometimes, but I manage. You nailed down to debts and stuff?” James nodded surprised how easy he found it to talk to Bobby.<br />
“Oh yes. My wife and kids- we don’t even live together and I am still caring for them. The eldest three have kids of their own which need support too. My wife’s demands get bigger each year even though I have not seen her in person for 5 years….” He sighed “plus I got to maintain the lifestyle and profile so the company looks right to our customers……” he shook his head “sometimes I wish it would all go away, but it won’t so I live with it”<br />
“Why not walk away? Get out on the road? Grow that beard” James smiled a mirthless smile<br />
“Not that simple. It’s not. No one truly vanishes, not any more.” <br />
<br />
The Barber started combing James hair slowly. “What would you do if you could start again?” he inquired making James tilt his head up towards him.<br />
“What all over from scratch? Ha. I dunno... I loved my wife and kids, and the job used to be fun, but it’s all got so, so complex, hurried. I would have my life less complex; a job that’s organised but less rigid. Plus more hobbies or something like that.”<br />
“I hear you man” Bobby said “Ya too much caught up in the web of life, the grind and the burdens of modern life  yeah?” James nodded at Bobby’s words who continued “I know what I’d want. I’d go for something to stand out. Be different. I don’t stand out, people don’t hear my message. I am dismissed as a crank or a smelly hippy. People need to know this country has become too complex, too bureaucratic, too tied to things. We need to embrace a simpler way of life, lower the aggression levels. I’d want to be someone who could get headlines, column inches, TV spots….. Yeah that’s what I want man. “<br />
“Stand out how?”<br />
“I dunno being good looking is so pass&eacute; these days, Ya needs something bizarre and odd to suck up the media interest, get on Oprah and stuff. Something freaky man, something no one else has” <br />
“An example please?” James said watching Bobby in the mirror.<br />
“Ya need to be special, something like being 8’ tall giant, or covered in hair...”<br />
“Or both?” James ventured<br />
“Well the odds of getting gigantism and hypertrichosis together is pretty small.” Bobby said with a slight grin.<br />
“What’s hypertrichosis?” James asked<br />
“It’s a generic disorder where someone is totally covered in long hair. Totally. Up to 4 inches in places on some” the Barber said calmly. <br />
“Like those wolf brothers down in Mexico or Jo-Jo during Barnum’s day.” Bobby nodded. <br />
“Well having that would get you noticed” James said relaxing back into the char.<br />
“I guess….. but…..”<br />
“But?” James looked over at Booby “but what?”<br />
“Well I guess being like Jo-Jo or Lionel the Lion faced man would be even more lonely What’s the point if I’d be alone? <br />
“Tell ya what” James said lightly “I’ll come along on this fiction. Say there’s two of us. Twins or something, how that change things?” Bobby looked at him sideways. <br />
“Well only if you’re happy with the idea man. If a freaky change to fantasise about dude” <br />
“It’s only a fantasy Bobby. It’s good to talk while we get our hair sorted out. <br />
“True man true. It can’t happen we is just thinking and talking” <br />
“I am going to wash your hair while you talk” the Barber said spinning James chair round and tipping it backwards. He set about washing James hair as Bobby started talking.<br />
<br />
“So what we want is a pair of dudes who stand out and get some serious attention, without losing sight of freedom, and a message? Not cogs in the machine? Yeah?” <br />
“I guess so.” James said relaxing under the Barbers expert fingers, his eyes half shut “so you have to define who they are first” <br />
“Hum… ok. How’s about twin sons of Jo-Jo?”<br />
“Was he married or had kids?” <br />
“Not that I know, no.” Bobby said watching James getting washed. <br />
“I’m genna leave you to soak and get you under Bobby” the Barber said leaving James and spinning Bobby’s chair around “carry on talking”<br />
“Too obvious and surly they’d be known. You need something more distant and exotic if you want to explode onto the modern media scene.” James said. <br />
“True man true… well how’s about the descendents of Petrus Gonzales - Wolf Boy of the Canary Islands? He was around in the 16th century; I’m sure his descendents are all around Europe, just need the right genes to kick in and bang two hairy little babes come out” Bobby relaxed under the Barbers fingers<br />
“You have researched this a lot then?” James said<br />
“A little man, when ya on the road as much as me, a library is a good place to get warm and spend a few hours. You didn’t think a hippy like me would like to read books occasionally dude?” <br />
“Never considered it. So tell me why would these two super hairy giants want to come here- what they got to say?”<br />
”Well it’s a message about freedom, about getting away from rules, keeping communities working, loving your friends and family, that sorta thing.”<br />
“That’s a bit woolly Bobby. Perhaps we should start somewhere else. How old are these guys?” The Barber had Bobby’s head covered in a mass of bubbles and smiled as the two men spoke; it was nice to let someone else guide the change. <br />
“20’s. Not too young, but youthful enough to still be in their prime. 25-26 something like that - not too old.” As he spoke his body began to change, his old muscles beginning to fill back out, his scars and weathering slowly melting away, the years falling off him. The two men continued to talk blind to the change.<br />
“Where they from?” <br />
“Well I was thinking somewhere like Russia, but maybe Portugal or the Greek Islands. Places where Petrus’ family went but are easy to be over looked.”<br />
“Ok – Greece sounds good, lots of Islands and mountains, rugged land. Good sun.” Bobby’s skin began to tone bronze as the years faded away. Over his firm muscles his tan looked good, natural, smooth. His face became more youthful, his voice higher and stronger with a Mediterranean tang to his accent. <br />
“What about looks? How sorta solid and beautiful should we be man?” <br />
“Got to be handsome defiantly; strong solid jaw, good roman nose, sharp piecing eyes, ears not to big, brows not too low- it’ll be covered in hair after all but a good structure cant hurt nothing too thuggish.” <br />
“Yeah none of the ‘big jaw’ and mis-shaped features of gigantism heh dude?” <br />
“Damm right bro. Any how tall did you want to be?” James said his eyes closed, his features melting into a new face a classic Greek-Roman face that could have some from a statue of Zeus or Hercules, his age falling into line with Bobby’s too.<br />
“Not totally out there man- don’t want to top Robert Wadlow but Titans can’t be too small. I’m thinking 7’ 11” a good clear two foot taller than the average man… now that would be groovy” As he spoke he began to stretch, his bronzed legs elongating out of his shorts, and his T-shirt popping up out of his waistband as got taller in the chair, forcing the Barber to adjust the seating position, he got wider in the shoulder and his legs filled in a little from the lithe things he had, but he didn’t get massive just beanpole tall.<br />
“I am thinking that’s too tall you know” James said “I was thinking more 7’ 7” and more muscle than beanpole- a little more wrestler than clothes line”. As he spoke he began to grow slowly, his body adding muscle as well as height.<br />
“But dude if we are going to be giants, then don’t we need giant muscles anyway?” <br />
“Well yeah so we’re born big then? Clothes are going to be a bugger”<br />
“Clothes won’t be that much of a problem I am sure” the Barber interjected to the suddenly nude giants.<br />
“That’s it! That’s why we are here dude!” Bobby cried as muscle began to fill in on his lanky frame “We are sons of a long lineage of hypertrichosis sufferers, but also on dad’s side a line of strongmen, circus performers!” Thick muscle began to pump up on his body- his chest inflating, his shoulders rounding out, an eight pack popping down his long belly, the thick diamonds of his thighs began visible, then engorged, his arms becoming massive. <br />
“So dad is tall, massive, heavy and strong with gigantism in his family and mum is a decedent of a legendary hypertrichosis carrier. That’s kind of freaky, but I guess that’s the point.” James said as his own body began to inflate with thick heavy muscle “but I still want to be shorter than you, heavier, more thick cut” <br />
“Man how’s about we are not only naturally big and strong but we work out? Shape the immense bodies we have?”<br />
“Now that’s a good idea. Beautiful, tall, heavy set and shaped like the Greek Gods themselves. Now that’s adding something” <br />
<br />
Bobby continued to grow, his shoulders overlapping the chair edge, his thick back pushing him further upwards on his solid ass. Under his bull’s neck his chest was two massive plates of thick muscle, his nipples rolled down pointing towards a ski plain of bumpy abs that flowed down to his groin. Legs that seem to flow stretched out from him along the floor thick with muscle his claves thick from carrying his massive frame around, his thighs and biceps where covered in veins pumping the blood around his oversized body. <br />
“One thing I got to ask brother” James said his voice deeper than Bobbies, still with that wonderful sexy accent “how big are our…. you know…. manhoods?” <br />
“Of course I know how big yours is bro, we been looking at each others since we where young and since that time down the pool it’s not as if we haven’t been playing about”<br />
“Yeah I know, but tell me again” Bobby rolled his eyes and looked down at the organ in question<br />
“Mine is exactly 11 x 3 inches flaccid” his dick grew and pulsed as he spoke “uncut of course, and a magnificent 13.5 x 5 when hard, like it often is around you”<br />
“And mine is shorter but thicker as it only right on my heroic form” James smiled as his cock began to rise and thicken, his foreskin re-growing as the heavy organ slapped against his belly still thickening “8 x 4 while soft but a beautiful 10 x 6 when fully engorged…good job you got that massive hinge on your mouth or you never fit me in” He smiled a sweet smile at his brother who looked the man-mountain over and blew him a kiss from between his pearly white even teeth.<br />
“And it’s a good job you have a flexible gut otherwise I couldn’t top out on in your bottom heh?”<br />
“No one said you had to be identical twins” the Barber said helpfully as he rinsed out Bobbies long hair. <br />
“Indeed not!” James said with a grin “We both know that I got my blue eyes from mother and he got his brown ones from dad” a blink and their eyes conformed. <br />
“Yeah but I got dads slightly pointed teeth you got mums pointed ears” features moved to match as they continued to horse trade. <br />
“Pointed they are hardly pointed, just slightly elongated. Anyway it’s not as bad as your size 25’s” Bobbies feet spread and grew huge with long thick toes.<br />
“Ha. At least I can out run you” Bobbies legs got a little thicker and stronger<br />
“But I am stronger than you, remember that Bull I used to wrestle?” James arms filled in further, even though it looked like they belonged on a champion bodybuilder already. James was defiantly heavier set than his gargantuan brother- his muscle seemed thick and heavy compared to his more graceful brother. The heavy muscle that hung from him suited his smaller frame and heavy cock. Unlike his brothers more extreme V shape James was more of a T his belly still had a cobblestone 6 pack but he was wider than his brother, though both of them where titanic compared to a normal person and even some Olympians<br />
 “I remember. I remember when it gored you too idiot” a three inch scar appeared on James’ right side, would have been a nasty wound when fresh “if not for my speed then you would have bled out”<br />
“I know your fast bro, I know. Dexterous too- you’re a natural gymnast” Bobbies tall body seemed to shift and the thick muscle became somehow more streamlined “but you have to agree I out strength you, out endurance you, can hold my breath longer, and my balls are bigger, more cooking apples to your golf balls” James reached over and hefted his big package in one meaty hand, his shaft getting rigid as he played<br />
“Yeah, well I can cum longer and thicker than you” Bobby said with a smirk reaching down and waved his outsized package, his long cock stiffening as he waved it about<br />
“I recover faster” James said sticking his tongue out. <br />
“Wanna bet on that man?” Bobby said stroking his hard member<br />
“Bro, you lose every time, but if you want….” He grabbed his own hard shaft<br />
“Gents please a moment?” the Barber cut in “it would be best if I finished your hair” the two giants looked sheepish at each other<br />
“Sorry” they said in unison. <br />
<br />
The Barber smiled and turned each of their chairs round in turn. He started with James, combing out his hair the black lengths getting longer and longer as he worked. A patch of black hair appeared on his chest and then another round his cock. As the Barber pulled the hair through his fingers it got longer and longer a huge mane of hair, all the while the hair grew all over James, racing all over his chest, shoulders, arms and back; across his lap, up his belly, and down his legs. It was almost criminal to cover such a body but soon all the skin was covered in a covering of silky black hair, his beard rushing in across his square jaw. The Barber soon had a length of hair that would hang to mid back and he began to plat it into long threads, as he did the hair covering James began to get longer and thicker. Slowly his skin vanished as every part of his body hidden by inches of thick fuzz. It grew up onto his cheeks, and down from his brow, even over his nose giving him the ‘classic look’ of hypertrichosis. His beard reached the middle of his chest and worked itself into a thick central bloc complete with sliver cording that could have come from a classical statue of a Spartan King. As the Barber finished a shudder went through James and he blew a tremendous load his thick cock pulsing and covering his hairy body a good quart of milky cum. <br />
“You never could resist a man playing with your hair could you Athos?” Bobby said twisting around in his chair and jerking his own massive shaft. <br />
“Oh, man!” Athos panted “when this guy gets his hands on your hair, you will blow a load too!” he said breathing heavy his massive chest heaving up and down as he tried to recover. The Barber smiled as he finished the braiding he was doing so the mass of Athos’s hair was hanging in three massive braids. <br />
“I’ll do you now Koios” he said to the other man, who turned himself round in the chair so he faced the mirror again. The Barber had more hair to work with here and as he combed he made the volume even heavier and longer than before, this mass would hang down to Koios’s bubble butt in a huge mane of black. With each stroke the mass of hair got longer and longer and giant began to grow body hair on his chest, under his arms and round his massive erect cock. Koios smiled as he watched the Barber work <br />
“You where right brother…. This mans hands are heavenly” he went to grab his cock but found his hand would not move from the arms of the chair….but a sudden of pleasure as the Barber touched his scalp and his cock was forgotten as he relaxed. <br />
<br />
As the Barber worked the hair began to hide the giant’s body as it had his twin brother, growing long and thick from his groin, down his legs, and up his belly. From under his pits, up his chest, over his shoulders, arms and back; it was not as long as the four inch hair on parts of his brother’s body but it was thicker in volume and softer. Where his brother had none on his feet or hands, Koios was covered everywhere but his palms and souls. Their fur patterns where slightly different too Athos’s hair was more curly than his and stuck to his body more, while Koios’s hair hung off like tassels, tassels that where suddenly dripping in cum as the barber finished and he exploded all over himself, thick ropy cum matting his fur to him as it had his brother<br />
“Oh, you where so right…..” he panted as his cock dribbled out its last. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you gents rub all that cream into your hair?” the barber suggested as if he was discussing Brylcreem' “in fact why don’t you stand and help each other?” The Barber stood a step back, and then a few more as the titanic pair got up- they simply dominated the room, filling it with muscle and their freaky hair – exactly like they had fantasised. No one could ignore these two! <br />
<br />
The older one (by two minutes) was Koios and he took charge kissed Athos deeply as their slick hands spread the white goo into each others torso’s, arms and backs. Their slick groins pressed into each other, their hard cocks rubbing against their slick bellies. Both where moaning in pleasure as they spread cum across each other matting their thick hair against their bodies. Athos broke the kiss and turned around, bending down and grabbing his knees, inviting Koios inside him, but before Koios could mount his cock exploded its heavy load all over Athos’s back! Koios wasted no time and reached up and began to massage the quart into the fur- making sure he got covered his brothers ass and between the cheeks as well as down each tree trunk like leg. <br />
<br />
Athos turned round so his brother could do the front of his legs and Koios went down kissing the long thick cock as he worked the long thick legs. As he went down to do Athos’s feet his head kept rubbing across Athos’s low hanging balls so it was invertible that he blew his load over Koios wide back! Athos shuddered in pleasure and then reached over and began to work his brothers back resting his still dripping cock on Koios’s shoulders. After he got most of the cum worked in Athos stepped back and pushed the kneeling Koios backwards onto the chequered floor allowing him to massage his brothers long, long legs. He did the left first throwing the limb onto his shoulder when done, then he started on the right leg, soon he had both legs on his shoulders and he inched forward pressing his hard cock to Koios’s hole. Koios smiled at his brother and twisted his legs catching Atho’s off guard and sending the huge man crashing to one side releasing his legs. Swiftly Koios got up and threw himself down onto his brothers prone body kissing him deeply. <br />
<br />
Athos’s enjoyed the kiss for a few moments and then pressed his brother away from him forcing Koios into a kneeling position. Pulling himself into a couch the two giants broke out into laughter filling the shop with their booming mirth. Koios reached forward and pulled his brother to him with one hand while the other grabbed his rigid cock. Athos wrapped his own paw around Koios’s boner and they kissed again tugging at each other. In almost slow motion they separated and slid round each other until Koios had Athos’s incredibly thick member in his mouth and Athos’s lips where wrapped round his brother’s tremendously long shaft.<br />
<br />
The Barber smiled as he watched the 69’ing brothers. He stepped past them to where James had left his car keys. Picking them up he faced the door and pressed the door open button, with a BLEEP the BMW became an open topped jeep with ‘The Green Circus’ on the side. A pile of flyers appeared next to XXXX’s chair for the world first ‘environmentally friendly circus’ , next to the other chair the poster for the circus the Titan Brothers had come in to ask him to post. A pile of clothes appeared next to each chair as well. <br />
<br />
A double throated moan of pleasure brought the Barber’s attention back to the rocking couple, as he did the brothers eyes went wide as both came at the same time, their eyes rolling back as their cocks pumped cum down their throats, sealing and deepening the brotherly love and their shared history. Neither missed a drop and the flow eventually slowed and stopped. They sat together for a moment and then Koios untangled himself and stood, his dusty, cum covered fur became clean, shiny fully brushed as he did. Athos also stood clean and brushed his long fur hanging off him.<br />
“Wow look at the job this guy did!” Athos’s exclaimed in his deep youthful voice, his English accented. He ran a hand through his thick body fur “no tangles, nothing” he smiled at the Barber “no one has been able to ever get his coat this untangled”<br />
“I am pleased you like it, I don’t get many customers like yourselves so it was a challenge I hope I have been able to meet”<br />
“I bet you don’t” Koios said “I can’t imagine many of your customers needing to go naked for a cut” The Barber smiled with his hidden knowledge of exactly how many ended up that way<br />
“Thanks for taking the flyers and poster” Athos said reaching for his pile of clothes. <br />
“Not a problem. You are not the first circus I have advertised in my window” <br />
“Well there is a pair of tickets with the flyers, I how you might be able to come one night. It is a great night out- entertainment, environmentalism and the Titan Brothers- all in one tent” said Koios, also reaching for his clothes. <br />
<br />
The Barber watched them dress- Athos was clearly dressed (inaccurately the Barber reflected) as an ancient Spartan warrior, loincloth, loose sleeveless tunic, belt, long cloak and bronze legging over sandals, combined with the shaped beard and braids it actually gave him a regal if fearsome look and did little to hide his immense body. He wore no weapons in his weapons belt, but he knew when he went on tonight his spear and sword would complete the look. <br />
“Looking good brother” Koios said cheerfully “I am so glad father got them to drop the whole ‘wolfman’ approach to the act. Now at least we deliver a message about war and its costs as well as scaring the crowd”<br />
“So dressing as Samson ad ripping a set apart is not the strongman thing then?” Athos asked pointing to his brothers loose tunic, sandals and belt. <br />
“Hey I make it look good” <br />
“True, true” Athos picked up the Jeep keys and turned to the barber “thank you again for your work. I’ll make sure we recommend you to all the guys” <br />
“No problem. Gald I could help make your journey easier” Koios offered the Barber his hand and they shook warmly<br />
“I just wish we had a place like this back home in Greece. You’d make a fortune from our family alone” <br />
<br />
They laughed and the two giants made their way to the door. Both had to turn sideways and duck to get out of the door, starling several passers by’s who simply stopped and stared as they unfolded from the shop door. Ever quick Koios grabbed some flyers from the back of the Jeep and past them out – not a single one went wasted since no one was able to stop staring long enough to say no. When done Athos climbed behind the wheel and Koios stood in the back with a huge circus advertising banner trailing behind him which unfurled as they moved away from the Barber shop and its smiling proprietor.</p>
