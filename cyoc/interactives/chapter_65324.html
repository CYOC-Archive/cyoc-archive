<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan's cheeks burned red with embarrassment. The effect was rather cute on his new, feminine head. &quot;How could <br />
you?&quot; he shouted angrily at Kevin. &quot;We've lost now, you messed up. What. The. Hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch Kylie made a tutting sound and wagged a finger. &quot;Now, now,&quot; she said. &quot;Don't get upset just yet. I <br />
never said you had to be the same gender you started as. Maybe Kevin realized that your true popular self is a <br />
buxom woman. Or a buff hermaphrodite with excellent cheekbones. That's normal, for some.&quot; Her smile was dark <br />
and wicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could argue that for anything!&quot; Bryan countered. &quot;If I had the body of, of, a bug thing like Kevin you <br />
would say that's normal for bug things! We've been set up. Kevin, please, just turn my head back to what it <br />
was and stop. That's all I want. I'll be popular then, okay?&quot; He was begging the insect woman, hoping to get <br />
through to the person Kevin was and not the creature he (she?) was becoming. His large, doe eyes pleaded with <br />
Kevin, urging him to do the right thing.<br />
<br />
Kylie circled around by Kevin. &quot;Well, what are you going to do next, hm?&quot; she asked. &quot;Do you see anything <br />
wrong with what you did? I think he's got rather pretty eyes, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; Bryan shouted at the witch.<br />
<br />
Ignoring him, Kylie continued. &quot;Remember, normal is relative. What's normal to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Kevin could answer, change swept across her body. The drying skin on her torso flaked away, revealing <br />
shiny exoskeleton covered in short, bristly hairs. Alternating bands of yellow and black crossed her body, <br />
from her neck to her groin. It had an elasticity to it, as evidenced by her taught, pregnant belly, but it was <br />
also strong and sleek.<br />
<br />
This was only a minor, cosmetic change coming to completion from earlier. The real action was happening behind <br />
her as her ass began to swell up, her crack sealing over as the flesh ballooned outward in a tear-drop shape <br />
just a little smaller than the size of her torso, or as she now thought of it, her thorax. It was flexible, <br />
curving slightly behind her. The skin was glossy and firm, coarse barbs sprouting across it as the black and <br />
yellow bands appeared one by one in rings down her new abdomen's length. A long, black stinger sprouted from <br />
the end, curving even further in a wickedly sharp point. The added weight helped balance her, especially with <br />
her bloated stomach.<br />
<br />
Kevin's body adjusted itself for this new development. Her sticky slit slid back a few inches as her hips <br />
angled backward and her still human-looking legs shifted backward as well to adapt her center of gravity. From <br />
the neck down, Kevin was looking more and more insect-like. All that she needed was bug legs, her upper arms <br />
to grow chitin, and perhaps a beautiful pair of gossamer wings. Her head was still the same as it was, and <br />
still looked rather masculine in comparison. It was almost like she was the inverse of Bryan, but who knew how <br />
long that would last? For either of them...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Gwen felt impossibly hot. She hadn't noticed it right away, being caught up in the ridiculous change that had <br />
happened to Bryan. Sure, she still kept looking down at his crotch and was even feeling a bit jealous that <br />
buggy Kevin had gotten to sample it, but she was still normal, relatively speaking. So was Stacy, Kylie had <br />
confirmed that. In fact, Stacy should thank her for giving her those lips and that tongue. She would be one of <br />
the most popular girls in school with them once she learned how to use them properly, and oh how Gwen wanted <br />
to help her learn. She could start by sucking her nipples...<br />
<br />
Her body ached with need. She was so horny it was hard to think about what Stacy needed next. She vaguely <br />
remembered a list of changes but couldn't remember what was on it. A bigger, juicier pussy? Even bigger tits? <br />
She wasn't sure but those sounded like great ideas to her the more she thought about them. Something nagged at <br />
her, though. Was that right?<br />
<br />
She looked at Stacy, admiring her sexy legs and her new curves. Her hair was kind of drab. Maybe she should <br />
change that? But what about the sweet ache between her own legs? Bug-lady had gotten some, why couldn't she?<br />
<br />
'All I have to do is make a change that'll do both,' Gwen realized. It didn't take her long to figure it out, <br />
now that she was motivated.<br />
<br />
Stacy's hair began to grow. It fell into her eyes as the short, curly strands straightened and lengthened. <br />
Soon it was down to her ass in long, lustrous waves. Then the color began to change, lightening dramatically. <br />
It stopped when it reached a bright platinum blond, the kind you would get in a hair salon and the kind you <br />
had to maintain by getting highlights and root touch ups every week.<br />
<br />
As Stacy brushed her new, fabulous hair from her eyes she felt something else. Her thoughts seemed to be <br />
twisting, becoming fuzzy. Gwen watched the confused look in her eye and licked her lips. What kind of girl had <br />
hair like Stacy now did? Why, the self-centered kind of course. The kind that loved their body and wanted <br />
others to worship it. The kind that loved getting their pussies licked.<br />
<br />
Gwen leaped at Stacy, knocking the blonde over backwards and landing on top of her, wings flared out <br />
dramatically. Gwen pushed up Stacy's princess dress, tearing it some with her sharp claws. She used them to <br />
tear off Stacy's panties as well, revealing a newly shaved and dyed blonde mound beneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax,&quot; Gwen cooed in her sexy, musical voice. &quot;You'll love this, Stacy. You're so beautiful. I need to taste <br />
you. Let me taste your sexy, perfect lips.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Gwen leaned in and began to lick greedily. She gasped at the delicious taste that touched her <br />
tongue. It really was perfect, she thought. She probed deeper, lapping and sucking. When she found Stacy's <br />
clit she paid special attention to it, running her tongue over the sensitive little button. As she worked, her <br />
teeth accidentally nipped Stacy. The sharp, coppery taste of blood mingled with the sweetness of Stacy's <br />
pussy. Gwen was in heaven. She shifted her grip and moved her body. Using her wings for balance, Gwen brought <br />
her own crotch up close to Stacy's head. She still wore panties but they were soaked and the outline of her <br />
enlarged cunt was clearly visible. It hadn't even entered Gwen's mind that she was mostly naked. It seemed <br />
natural, as did licking Stacy and demanding the same in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; Gwen urged between licks with her musical voice. She shuddered as she felt the magic sweep up her <br />
body, signalling her change. She was oblivious as she kept swallowing the sweet juices from between Stacy's <br />
legs.</p>
