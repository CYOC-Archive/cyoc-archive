<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once you get to the building you then clock in and start heading to your desk but on the way you bump into your coworker Jim, He then says sorry but afterwards eyes you up and down and says &quot;say you&#39;re looking different today... but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it as to what&quot;. You then blush nervously and apologize to him for bumping into him and continue to your desk but then he grabs your hand and notices how smooth and hairless it is and smiles at you &quot;ah I did not realize you swung that way&quot; he then gives your ass a playful pinch and whispers &quot;meet me in the bathroom during break&quot; with that he then gives your ass a playful slap and you rush off to your desk redder than a tomato.<br />
<br />
Work goes on like any other day until break time comes, you had no intention of meeting Jim in the bathrooms but on your way to the break room you pass by the restrooms and feel a hand grab you and pull you in and you sigh as you realize it&#39;s Jim. &quot;Let me go you bastard!&quot; you shout but he just shushes you and say &quot;quiet bitch! unless you want me to spill your secret to the whole office!&quot; you then shake your head &quot;what secret?&quot; you ponder and he then facepalms himself and say&#39;s &quot;oh you know, the little thing about you being gay... It would be a shame if the office were to figure that little secret out now wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; you then nod in defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now&quot; Jim then commands &quot;undress yourself and present yourself to me!&quot; not wanting to get on Jim&#39;s bad side you do as you are told and when Jim see&#39;s your underwear he snickers to himself &quot;ha! I knew you were gay!&quot; you just stare at him with anger as you finish undressing yourself and as Jim comes over he notices the opening in your underwear and pulls it open to take a look &quot;wow I knew you were gay but I had no idea you were trans as well!&quot; He then bellows with laughter and you just sigh and ask him if he want&#39;s you to remove your underwear and he shakes his head &quot;nah I&#39;ll get those sugar!&quot;<br />
<br />
He then grabs the hem of your panties and you prepare for you junk to reappear and shock the hell out of Jim but to your surprise once Jim is done removing your underwear you are shocked to find that you still have a fully functioning vagina rather than a cock and fear begins to set in but before you can ponder the consequences Jim just smile&#39;s and says &quot; shall we?&quot; he then proceeds to pin you down and he positions his cock right at your vaginal entrance and without warning he then thrusts his member in and you moan with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Jim laughs &quot;he you even sound like a girl when you moan, slut!&quot; just then a wave of pleasure overwhelms you and you spasm as your orgasm hits you &#39;this has to be a dream... it just has to!&#39; but it was all too real for it to simply be a dream. As Jim keeps thrusting harder and harder you fail to notice your hips getting wider and wider, growing to child bearing proportions and your ass ballooning out at the same time you are afraid of what might happen if Jim climaxes inside you and before it can get that far you gather your strength and punch Jim square in the jaw. He reels back in pain and exit&#39;s your vaginal entrance and shouts out &quot;you bitch!&quot; but before he can retaliate you grab your underwear and run out heading home early.<br />
<br />
You sit on the bed sobbing at what just happened, &#39;how could he... how could my own coworker use me like that...&#39; suddenly a voice enters your mind and says &#39;oh, c&#39;mon! don&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t enjoy it! even a little!&#39; just then your head starts hurting again and you find yourself talking back to the voice in your head but the thoughts aren&#39;t your own &#39;yeah... I guess you&#39;re right even if he was overly rough Jim was still a stud&#39; you shake your head &#39;no! why am I thinking this! there must be something wrong with me!&#39; You then put the underwear back on and remove them relived to see your penis once again.<br />
<br />
&#39;I could always punish him for you if you like&#39; you hear the voice say and you wipe a tear from your face and say &#39;you would do that for me?&#39; not knowing who this voice actually is and it responds &#39;yes of course! anything for you love!&#39; Meanwhile back at Jim&#39;s apartment he was sitting on the sofa with a ice pack on his cheek from where you had punched him and he think&#39;s &#39;that bitch, why&#39;d he have to hit me like that?&#39; Suddenly a wave of pain overtook Jim and he rolled onto the floor in agony &quot;dear god! what&#39;s happening to me!&quot; in that instant Jim shrunk from his towering 6&#39; height to a dainty 5&#39;4&quot;.<br />
<br />
The changes did not end there however and he roared in agony as his back cracked as it arched backwards giving his spine a feminine arch. Next his hips and ass grew to child bearing proportions and his waist narrowed inward giving his frame a sexy hourglass shape. Next his thighs ballooned out too and his calves tapered down to his feet which also shrank from their size 13 shoe size to a much daintier size 9. Next his arms and hands slimmed down and lost all their muscle definition and his shoulders caved inward greatly diminishing his broad chest and at the same time his Addams apple shrank away into his neck and his voice shot up several octaves until he sounded just like a woman.<br />
<br />
Finally his chest ballooned out into two F cup breasts and his ass and hips ballooned out even more to match and finally he screamed in pain as the last remining part of his manhood shot up into his body and formed a vagina. Once the pain subsided she then got a massive migraine headache that lasted at least a hour but once it subsided she no longer remembered ever being a man names Jim but recalls that she was always a woman named Jacqueline and everything about her life was still the same aside from that and reality altered itself around this new information.<br />
<br />
Jacqueline then smiles as she get&#39;s horny and decides to head to her room for some much needed relief. Meanwhile back at your house you hear a knock on the front door and head to the door to answer it and see another coworker from work his name was Michael and you saw that he had your work uniform in his hands and he extends his arm out to hand them to you. &quot;Hey there Garrett, I saw these lying on the ground in the restroom at work and thought you might need them&quot; you then take the clothes from him and blush slightly, he then says &quot;I heard what happened from our boss, it&#39;s crazy to think that Jim took advantage of you like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
You then begin to burst into tears and Michael asks &quot;is it alright if I come in?&quot; you nod your head and move over to let him inside. Once the door is closed you set your work uniform on the living room chair and notice something off about them, you think they look more feminine but you shake your head at the thought and say &#39;there&#39;s no way...&#39; You then sit down on the sofa and Michael joins you to comfort you &quot;you need to report him to the police he says, just cause you are trans does not mean he can ju-&quot; but then Michael stops in his tracks and his eyes gloss over.<br />
<br />
You shake him and shout &#39;Michael, are you okay?&#39; but then he comes back to and looks over at you and says &quot;uh, what was I talking about again?&quot; you sniffle and reply &quot;we were talking about Jim...&quot; and then Michael looks at you confused &quot;Jim? what Jim? we don&#39;t know anyone named Jim!&quot; and you look at him confused &quot;yeah! we do! you were just talking about how he-&quot; but then you get a massive headache and you lose your train of thought &quot;but he- uhm... what was i talking about again?&quot; Michal just thinks you are making it up and decides to change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you call me over here again?&quot; he asks and that&#39;s when it comes to you &quot;oh yeah! now I remember! I was going to ask if you wanted to take our relationship to the next level!&quot; &#39;that&#39;s strange&#39; you think to yourself &#39; could have sworn that was not what I was going to say...&#39; but just then you lose your train of thought again and Michael says &quot;sure thing babe, what did you have in mind?&quot; this weirds you out for you did not realize Michael was gay before... but you just shrug this thought off and say &quot;wait here okay?&quot; and he just rolls his eyes and says &quot;okay&quot;</p>
