<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Classes let out the earliest at the elementary school level and then progressed up to the high school in Moon Lake, just as they did for any public school district in America. Normally that would mean that Martha&#39;s day would end first, but that would be more to after she got her certification sorted out and updated and was teaching full time again. For now though, she could only serve as a substitute and was presently subbing for the Middle School&#39;s assistant PE coach, which meant the end of her day was when the Middle School let out. She found that PE was a bit different than the standard classes and potentially more hectic as Katherine &quot;Kat&quot; Johnson had to deal with all the middle school grades, five through eight which all had different needs and concerns.<br />
<br />
Those in fifth grade were pretty much like what Martha would expect those in the elementary school to be. Those that were weres had their were scents, but it was weak and hard to fully determine what kind of were that the child would grow into. Martha managed to figure some out, but it took her a little bit of time to sort that out. Much of that was because she was new to Moon Lake and definitely new to the kids, though she did manage to keep them going with Kat&#39;s lesson plans for the day&#39;s activities. Once they got to the eighth graders, however, and the kids were around twelve to fourteen, their were scents were growing stronger as they began to get closer to when their first transformations would occur. Many of them also began to exhibit some of the physical and mental signs of that coming transformation, which her study materials had made some mention of. There, Martha had to make sure that the young weres didn&#39;t either forcefully do anything that would put the normals in their class at risk or do something that might accidentally put the normals in their class at risk. Thankfully, things turned out fine for a first day.<br />
<br />
&quot;That turned out well,&quot; Martha commented as the last students of the day departed from the gym as the last bell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;You expected something more troublesome?&quot; Kat inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe more questions at me being a sub and all that,&quot; Martha answered and remembered some of the moments of &quot;rebellion&quot; that both Nate and Eric went through when they were in middle school in Minnesota, &quot;or the first stirrings of teenage rebellion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... well, that could happen and even does happen on occasion,&quot; Kat answered, &quot;as it IS a public school... But many were parents have worked hard to make sure their children understand and respect their normal classmates and respect weres of other species that things aren&#39;t too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something that comes with wanting to show weres aren&#39;t the snarling monsters in the movies?&quot; Martha surmised, thinking off hand at Nate&#39;s movie collection.<br />
<br />
Kat nodded for her answer, &quot;Anyway... I will have a little bit of paperwork to close out the day, not to mention bus duty today, and as a sub, your day is officially done. If you wish to clock out in the office and go home that is fine...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can handle the bus duty for you, if you let me know where I&#39;m to go,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;besides, if you&#39;d like to talk more privately... I&#39;d think it would be best that I stay until you&#39;re ready to head out. That way you can follow my car home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat gave a smile. She hadn&#39;t found her future mate yet, but like any were, she was just as easily aroused and eager for more &quot;adult fun&quot; as any other were. Martha Anderson might only be a werecat and couldn&#39;t match Kat in terms of strength and power and she might be married, albeit in an open marriage, but that didn&#39;t mean that Kat wasn&#39;t interested in the beautiful werecat before her.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Eric called to Julie as he found her by her locker at the end of the school day, &quot;Julie!&quot;<br />
<br />
She barely turned when Eric pulled her into a very happy hug with his arms around Julie. It felt good to be close to her, but Eric had found that what Martin had said to him about dealing with &quot;the longing&quot; as he&#39;d termed it had worked fairly well. He&#39;d made it through the day without any real distractions from missing Julie, though that didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t happy to see her now. He was pretty sure she felt the same way when he felt her arms wrap around him in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone is happy to see me,&quot; Julie commented with a smile on her lips and a twinkle in her eyes and loving the return smile and twinkle from Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m always happy to see you, my Jewel,&quot; Eric told her as they broke from their hug, &quot;you ready to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just about,&quot; Julie answered and reached into her locker to retrieve a her backpack and what homework assignments she had for the day. Once her homework was in her backpack, she turned to face Eric and smiled, &quot;There, ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then made their way out of the school and made their way out and soon looked for where Ben was parked. They found Ben opening the driver&#39;s side door, but he was waiting by it. It was clear that he was waiting for someone, and likely Nate and Alex. Ben eventually noticed them and looked directly to Eric and Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, you two,&quot; Ben said in a friendly voice, &quot;you two looking for a ride?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;as Julie and I will still have some dancing lessons to go through and practice on... And since Nate and Alex have a date tonight, we&#39;d like to at least have something to start on and get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Ben nodded, &quot;though you two may need to either squeeze together in the front or let one sit in the back and one in the front. That&#39;ll be up to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll squeeze together,&quot; Julie answered before Ben could finish.<br />
<br />
Ben only smiled as the two stood together. They waited patiently for the last two people that Ben was waiting for, Nate and Alex, though they didn&#39;t have to wait long. The two werewolves soon came out from along the front of the school and came toward Ben&#39;s car. Nate was the first to speak to his younger brother, privately happy to see all the growth that finding Julie had brought out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Eric,&quot; Nate spoke as he playfully ruffled his younger bother&#39;s hair, &quot;You two looking for a ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... so as to maximize what time we have for dance practice before you go for your date,&quot; Eric answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dance practice?&quot; Alex wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never had any real reason to before,&quot; Eric explained, knowing that while Nate might not have had a boyfriend left in Minnesota, his brother was the more outgoing before coming to Moon Lake and by hiding from society after being bullied meant that he didn&#39;t have any experiences of his own that would allow him to know any dancing steps first hand. Finding and falling in love with Julie Stovall, however, had changed that and he didn&#39;t want do poorly. The fact that Julie wasn&#39;t any better at dancing than he was a surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ve been helping,&quot; Nate said with pride, &quot;You want to practice too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I got stuff to get things ready for tonight,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;besides, I can break it down with the best of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Ben commented from the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; Alex answered and shot Ben a glare.<br />
<br />
Eric and Nate looked a bit puzzled, as there seemed to be a story there, but they let it go for the moment. While Alex climbed into the back seat of Ben&#39;s car, Nate turned his focus to Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t hang around for too long,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;as my date with Alex starts at five... but I can get you started until mom gets home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as we have a starting point, it doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Eric answered.<br />
<br />
With that, Nate climbed in to sit in the back seat next to Alex. Nate pulled the front seat back toward him once he was in the back seat so that Julie and Eric could climb in. Bet set his armrest up so that Julie could settle into the middle front seat and while Eric climbed into the front passenger seat. Nate watched as once Eric was in and the door shut and then buckled that Julie did her best to move closer to him, both to give Ben the room to drive and likely to also to be as close to Eric as she could. He made the mental promise to thank Julie for being there for Eric before their lesson got going. Fourteen might be young for an engagement, but Eric deserved to be happy and free from bullies, and Julie had seemed to allow for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Nate, want to...&quot; Alex said playfully to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one will be making a mess in my car,&quot; Ben spoke as he glanced in his rear-view mirror and backed out, &quot;be it in the front or the BACK seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t make a mess,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just making sure,&quot; Ben answered and proceeded to drive out.</p>
