<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was going to become just like Bull, another porter for the resort!  Derrick gasped and looked up at Bull.  The minotaur seemed to smile and grunted.  There was no more intelligence to the sound than there had been before, but now Derrick &#39;heard a rumbling voice in his head.  &quot;Brother.  Our Brother.  Come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick longed to find a mirror so he could see what he looked like, but there was nothing...  wait!  The clear pool!  He moved over to the water hole and stared at his reflection in the still water.  It was large enough to give him a good view, though the flickering light of the torches made it difficult to make out fine details.  <br />
<br />
It was still him, mostly, but a darker, dirty version, as if he was some wild child from the forest.  Or the fields.  Tarzan of the Cows?  He grinned at the shaggy, teenager in the surface.  The bumps high on his temples were the start of horns, and his nose and lower face were slightly swollen.  Pushing back the dark hair, he found his ears were now slightly pointed.  Closer examination of his skin revealed that not all the darkness was dirt - fine hair had started to appear on his arms, legs, and chest.  He was going to be a minotaur!  This was so weird, but so great!  Part of him wondered if this was all just for the week of vacation, or if he was going to be a minotaur forever.  <br />
<br />
Bull grunted again, adding a snort and a lowing sound.  &quot;Come, Brother.  Pleasure awaits.  Cows will welcome you and help you complete your change.&quot;  is what Derrick heard in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cows?&quot;  He straightened and walked back to the towering minotaur, grinning.  &quot;Let&#39;s go!  I don&#39;t want to waste any time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bull headed out going further down the cavern passages, with Derrick following close behind.  They passed another minotaur, absolutely identical to Bull, as the receptionist had said.  This new Bull nodded and stopped to place his forehoof on Derrick&#39;s head just as the first had done.  Once again, the teen felt that powerful sense of bonding, and a curious sense of belonging.  He also felt the prickling start u[p, and the odd throbbing.  After the new minotaur had continued on, Derrick felt his head and face, and checked his body.  It was hard to tell for sure, but his horns seemed more developed, and his face a little more protruding.  Was the fine hair a little thicker?<br />
<br />
A third minotaur confirmed Derrick&#39;s suspicions when the friendly head pat increased his sense of being a brother to these monsters and also added at least a couple of inches to his height.  These Bulls were making him more like them!  More thant hat, they were sharing themselves with him.  Derrick had a hazy awareness of the minotaur mind now, not quite understanding, but comfortable with them and his impending future.<br />
<br />
He and Bull encountered three more brothers, these naked and damp, reeking of bovine sweat and musk.  Each repeated the hoof/hand touch to Derrick&#39;s head, and each left the boy even more transformed.  He felt powerful, massive, excited.  A stronger bovine scent started to drift from ahead of them, and he started to get aroused.  The loincloth was tenting out now, and Derrick realized there was a lot more malenesss between his legs than he had had before.  <br />
<br />
Light appeared in front of them, a soft golden glow that resolved into an opening that looked out over a rolling valley.  Dozens of cattle were grazing here, and Derrick was not surpised to see two more Bulls engaged with cows.  He and his Bull watched the minotaurs bellow and grunt over their mates, until both male and female bellowed in joint pleasure.  The first to finish saw them and plodded over to the cave mouth.  His heavy black bovine cock was still slick with the cow&#39;s fluids, and he reeked of sweat and rut.  <br />
<br />
Derrick stared at the field in awe, but also felt nervous.  Could he mount a cow?  It was more than just morales, which were pretty shaky now.  He was bigger, but not that much bigger.  The new Bull grunted and instead of putting his hoof/hand on the teen&#39;s head, reached down and wiped his still-erect cock with the palm and fingers.  He raised the glistening hoof-hand up and wiped the slick residue of sex across Derricks nose and mouth.<br />
<br />
Startled, Derrick gasped as his face throbbed, then again as the new minotaur placed the heavy hand on his head as the others had.  The link was powerful and clear, this Bull&#39;s connection much more intense.  He could see himself through the minotaur&#39;s eyes, a mishappen creature that rapidly swelled and darkened into something much more handsome.  He felt the changes even as he saw them, face pushing out into a short muzzle, eyes enlarging and drifting apart as his horns grew out several inches.<br />
<br />
This minotaur stepped away with a grunt that also said &quot;Welcome, Brother&quot;, only to be replaced with the last who had come in from the cows.  There was no surprise this time as the Bull repeated the actions of the previous minotaur, but both the transformation and link felt much more intense.  Derrick knew the Bulls now.  This one had been a stock clerk who had won a vacation here.  The previous Bull had been even younger than Derrick, a boy of 8 or 9 who matured into the hulking minotaur the same way Derrick was being changed.  They all remembered where they had come from, though none knew which they had been before.  It was not important.  They were Bull.  <br />
<br />
There was a tug at his loincloth and it fell free, revealing a massive bovine cock and swollen testicles.  Not as big as the others&#39; yet, but the cows before him would complete the transformation.  Bull wanted the cows.  Derrick wanted the cows.  He took a shuffling step, then another, feeling the need, the desire building inside him.   He felt eyes watching, and twisted back to see his Bull and the two from the field watching him.  He could sense them in his head, satisfaction, welcome, a sense of accomplishment at helping the human join them.  There was no difference in the thoughts, no way to tell which was thinking what.  They were all thinking the same thing.  <br />
<br />
Derrick continued towards the cows, his nostrils flaring as he identified those who would welcome him.  He felt satisfaction, welcome, a sense of accomplishment at helping the human join....  Wait.  He was the human.  Or had been.  Certainly he was far more minotaur than the scrawny boy he&#39;d started as.  Eight years old.  No.  Fifteen!  Happy to give up the dull stockroom job to serve the resort.  No!  he was still in school!  <br />
<br />
Confusing slowed his approach to the cows as he struggled to think, really think on his own.  Somehow, he was connected to all of the other Bulls that had touched him, and he was aware of them almost as completely as he was of his own body.  But his own identity as Derrick was slipping way, merging with the Bulls.  They were all content, devoid of fear or worry.  Using their muscles to do heavy labor, common jobs requiring little intelligence.  What was it the receptionist had said?  All of the minotaurs are the same?  They were all Bull.  And Derrick was becoming Bull, too.<br />
<br />
A faint sense of alarm provided Derrick with an anchor to hold his dimming identity.  The Bulls all had pasts, had all been human, and had all been here longer than a week.  Time was hard to comprehend - what was a week?  And there had been other Bulls.  Bulls who stayed in the field with the cows, who did not rise to two legs after falling over the backs of females.  Bulls who had become bulls that eventually vanished from the herd.  None of this bothered the Bulls watching him or any of the others.  Being a bull was just another form of being Bull.  They did not have an awareness of there being a difference.<br />
<br />
Derrick stopped suddenly, staring at the back end of a large, shaggy cow.  She was in heat, her huge black cunt slick and hot.  He was just a step away from plunging his massive buyll&#39;s cock into her opening, the action that would complete his transformation and make him truly Bull.  The awareness of a half-dozen minotaurs was accepting his fate, urging him to join them, to be them.  But Derrick still help onto to a scrap of his identity, and now he was afraid to take this final step.<br />
<br />
The cow bellowed and looked back, her tail swishing back and forth, urging him to fill her.  He could sense her thoughts now, too, identify with the dull but insistent needs of the animal.  The longer he stood here, the more he connected with her, the bovine mentality even simpler and duller than that of the Bulls.  Derrick felt the creeping fog thicken in his head, felt his hands start to stiffen.  If he mounted the cow now he would become a minotaur.  If he waited much longer, he would become a bull and then mate her.  Why did it matter?  He struggled to hang on to his intelligence, his identity.  What other choice was there?  Refuse?  Run away?  He bellowed in frustration, and then made the decision to</p>
