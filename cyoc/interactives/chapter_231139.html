<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenna was still buzzed from her experience in the store, smiling and humming to herself as she walked down the street, when the familiar feeling of vibrating in her pocket captured her attention.<br />
Flicking her phone out and into view she smiled at the notification<br />
(Becky: hey girlfriend, you in midtown?)<br />
Jenna chuckled at her profile picture, herself and their old collage sorority, all at a rave trying to get in on the photo<br />
(Jenna: yeah I&#39;m around, wana meet up?)<br />
(Becky: hell yeah!, meet me at the shortbread break)<br />
Jenna rolled her eyes, if Becky was known for anything it was her sweet tooth, she almost always had something sweet on hand<br />
&quot;Helps to fuel my sweet personality&quot; as Becky put it.<br />
Letting out a sigh Jenna pocketed her phone and began walking towards the cafe.<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Mh- Sho good, Oh hey girl!&quot; Becky brushed the crumbs from her shirt and quickly sprang from her chair before attacking Jenna with a hug<br />
&quot;Hey Becky, how you been?&quot;<br />
&quot;Eh could be better, but your here now so it&#39;s all good&quot; she replied, her bubbly personality slightly duller than normal<br />
&quot;Cmon, sit down and talk to me&quot; Jenna took Becky by her hands and lead her back to her seat and sat down across from her.<br />
<br />
Becky short cut blonde hair was haphazardly brushed, a pink streak through her hair that she kept back behind her ear.<br />
Round silver glasses seemed to frame her crystal green eyes perfectly, long thick eyelashes and freckles under her eyes, a small stud piercing on her nose and under her full plump lips, and a black lace choker around her neck, if she was being honest, Jenna was slightly jealous of her friends looks, her face and figure pulling off the &quot;pretty blonde&quot; look to perfection<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s......it&#39;s brad&quot; she sighed, looking down at the table, pulling her hands away from Jenna to rest her head in her palms<br />
&quot;That bastard, what did he do to you&quot; Jenna&#39;s temper flaring slightly, having had her own unfortunate messy break up not too long ago<br />
&quot;Well, got home late, working a few extra shifts, you know how it is.....open the door, he&#39;s on the couch, but.....by the window, is a bra, that wasn&#39;t mine, and a pair of soaked through panties on the coffee table&quot; Becky&#39;s voice hitches as she retold her experience<br />
<br />
Jenna was lost for words, deciding to keep quiet, at least until Becky was done<br />
&quot;It was like he wanted to get caught, he didn&#39;t even deny it, he just got up, grabbed his stuff and walked out, threw his key at me as he left&quot;<br />
Jenna took a deep breath, seeing her friend like this was beyond unpleasant<br />
&quot;How....how long ago was this?&quot;<br />
Becky took a steadying breath &quot;a-around a week and a half ago?&quot;<br />
Jenna grabbed Becky&#39;s hand again<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you call me, I&#39;d pick up you know I would&quot;<br />
Becky shrugged her shoulders &quot;I guess, I didn&#39;t want to drag you down into the dumps with me, thought I could handle it myself&quot; she gave a light chuckled before wiping her damp eyes<br />
&quot;Guess I wasn&#39;t doing as good as I thought&quot;<br />
Jenna pondered for a moment, before a lightbulb went off in her head<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, I got a party to get to tonight, and your gonna be my date&quot; Jenna declared, all of Becky&#39;s sadness seemed to wash away in an instant, replaced with shock, and bright red cheeks<br />
&quot;Wh- what ummm Jen, girl I love ya but, it&#39;s been a while since I swung that way&quot; she said with a nervous chuckle, looking away from Jenna, her eyes flicking back to her from time to time<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Becky bear...pleeeeease?&quot; Jenna began batting her eyes and pouting her lip at Becky, before she let out a sigh of defeat<br />
&quot;Ok ok fine, god you haven&#39;t used that since collage, il be your date, provided there&#39;s some late evening activities of course&quot;<br />
Now it was Jenna&#39;s turn to blush, biting her bottom lip as she curled her hair around her finger<br />
&quot;Oh...of course, if you know....if your up for some...late night fun&quot; she hummed, smiling as Becky began to snicker<br />
&quot;Oh girl just say you want to get into my pants already&quot; Becky laughed, Jenna put her hands either side of her face as she saw several of the cafe&#39;s customers turn to look at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well actually, there is something you can help me with to get ready for the party now&quot; Jenna smirked as she held up the box for Becky to see.<br />
Becky&#39;s eyes began to get a gleam of mischief in them<br />
&quot;Nononono not that Becky&quot; Jenna hurried to correct her friend<br />
&quot;Awww no fun&quot; she poured before they both burst into laughter<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon il show you&quot;<br />
___________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so how does both of us in a private bathroom, with you getting undressed not lead to hot steamy sex?&quot; Becky chuckled, her arms folded over her chest<br />
It was then that Jenna brought out the bodysuit from its box<br />
&quot;Even better, your getting naked, to put something on that makes you look naked, makes perfect sense&quot;<br />
Jenna rolled her eyes and stuck out her tongue as she slipped her bra off<br />
&quot;Ooooo the girls have decided to join us&quot; Becky purred, reaching out and cupping her underboob, getting a squeak of supprise from Jenna as she spun to face her friend, hands on her hips<br />
&quot;Hey, save that for later missy&quot; she said in a serious toan before letting a small smile crack.<br />
Bending over Jenna removed her jeans and panties, now standing naked apart from a pair of bright pink socks, cupping her hands over her blooming cooch, smoothing out some stray pubic hairs from her cute little bush at her pussys peak before slipping her feet into the bodysuits leg holes, hoisting it up like a pair of tights, then slipping it&#39;s shoulder straps on, surprised with how flush it sat against her skin, the suits fake nipples standing erect and dark, Jenna caressed them gently, almost going as far as to play with them<br />
&quot;Oooo boy, this is trippy, almost thought this was the real me for a sec&quot; she chuckled nervously as a loud zipping sound went up her back, feeling the skin like embrace of the suit, each inch of its fabric clinging like a second skin to each of her curves<br />
&quot;Ok sooooo, how does this work?&quot; Becky asked, holding a black hose, before plugging one end perfectly over a fosset<br />
&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s how it works&quot; she chuckled as Jenna opened a hidden hatch on the bodysuits bellybutton, plugging the hose in and turning on the fosset<br />
&quot;Ok just say when&quot;.<br />
<br />
The sound of running water filled the small bathroom, Jenna closed her eyes and placed her hands over the bodysuits midsection, awaiting it&#39;s growth, imagining it as her own womb, growing with new life, swelling her up, making her grow bigger and bigger, feeling her tits blow up, sloshing with thick creamy milk, whimpering slightly at the thought, her pussy aching for something to pleasure her, to make her fantasy come true.<br />
&quot;Heloooooo, earth to Jenna, you taking me to this party as an exercise ball?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha- who, OH GOD!&quot; Jenna squeaked as she saw her new figure.<br />
<br />
She looked like she was about to pop out a set of twins, BIG twins, she looked to the point of so pregnant you looked at them like a bomb that could blow at any moment, she was so much bigger than she thought she would be<br />
&quot;Ok, this is so weird&quot; Jenna said with a nervous tone, turning her profile to the side, gazing at herself in the bathroom mirror.<br />
Curiously she began to press and prod the fake belly, finding it surprisingly taught, yet more squishy at the top, and the weight, god the weight was murder on her ankles and hips, arching her back and cupping her hands under the bodysuits sloshing swell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, that&#39;s big&quot; Jenna huffed, straightening her legs with a groan as she adjusted to the new weight<br />
&quot;Guess I kinda got caught up in everything&quot; she chuckled<br />
Becky rolled her eyes and threw Jenna&#39;s shirt at her<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon preggers, get some clothes on and let&#39;s get going&quot;<br />
<br />
The shirt was the easy part, well, if easy meant that her shirt had become a second bra, the fabric not having enough resolve or elastic to stretch over her new mountain of a bump, but then there was the real challenge, her jeans, fitting snug around her ass and thighs, they had no choice but to sit low on her hips, embarrassingly low, having being wrestling with the zipper for close to ten minutes now Jenna almost felt like crying, god this bodysuit was messing up her hormones big time<br />
&quot;Sooooo are we ready to pop in to a maternity store yet?&quot; Becky piped up, wrapping her arms around Jenna from behind, cupping them around her belly and resting her head on her shoulder<br />
&quot;No I refuse, there&#39;s no way im-&quot;<br />
SNAP<br />
Holding the remains of her zipper in her hand Jenna let out a sigh of defeat<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine.....but we&#39;re calling them yoga pants or something like that, NOT maternity leggings&quot; she warned before storming out of the bathroom, now with a slight waddle.</p>
