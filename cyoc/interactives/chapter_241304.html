<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hours tick by, and Zoey enjoys every second of being a mom, she plays with her “daughter”, feeds her, changes her diapers and she even enjoys cleaning the house and doing laundry, “being a mother is so much fun,” she says to herself as she cleans the windows in the living room. Zoey smiles wide when she thinks about her “daughter” upstairs in her room, the currently four-year-old playing with her dolls, “Jeff looks so adorable as a girl,” Zoey mumbles to herself, “and she’s developing into a beautiful young lady, I wonder what tomorrow brings”.<br />
<br />
Due to Zoey’s manipulation of Jeff’s mind, the former teenage boy’s mind matures just like a normal girl’s as she ages up, the “girl” not even remembering that she had been a boy a couple of hours ago, she also doesn’t remember that “her” “mother” is in reality HIS little sister.<br />
<br />
Zoey had put Jeff’s laptop away, planning to return it to its original place an hour before they return to normal, she did this to make sure her “daughter” won’t think about doing something stupid with the program.<br />
<br />
33 hours later, “Jess” is now a pretty 11-year-old girl, with long smooth black hair which reaches the middle of her back and tied in a pony tail. The “girl’s” chest has developed into two beautiful 32B cup breasts, she also has a beautiful firm round butt and wide hips, which causes her to have an amazing and stunning hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
When seeing her former brother develop even amazes Zoey, ‘whoa, she’s really getting more and more stunning and beautiful with every passing second,’ the “woman” thinks to herself, feeling a strange sense of pride, a smile spreads across her face, ‘she’ll be turning heads for sure, and it wouldn’t surprise me if a boy falls in love with her. Though I hope that won’t happen, since “Jess” won’t be around much longer, in 15 hours both of us will be back to normal, and I don’t want to see the feelings of a boy being hurt. Hm… I think the best would be, should a boy fall in love with “Jess”, to tell the boy the truth, before it becomes serious’.<br />
<br />
“Mom,” the 11-year-old girl suddenly says, tearing Zoey from her thoughts. “Jess” is wearing a padded white bra and matching panties, over these underwear she is wearing a white t-shirt with a image of a unicorn on the front, a blue skinny shorts and a pair of pink sandals, her feet are bare.<br />
<br />
“Yes dear,” Zoey asks.<br />
<br />
“I’d like to head to the park to read a book, it’s such a beautiful and warm day”.<br />
<br />
Zoey smiles, “alright, but take your phone with you, and make sure to be back at latest 6pm”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles, “will do mom,” she says, she then hurries up the stairs to grab her handbag and her favorite book, a story about a princess who falls in love with a stable boy and the two start a secret relationship, and is soon walking down the street towards the park which is four blocks down the road.<br />
<br />
Zoey smiles to herself as she watches “Jess” almost skipping down the street, “she looks so happy,” she says to herself, “though I wonder, is she still Jeff or does she really think she is a girl? I hope that’s not the case, Jeff will be so mad at me when he returns to normal!”<br />
<br />
“Jess” meanwhile reaches the park and finds a quiet bench under a tree, the “girl” sits down and takes out her book, flipping to the chapter she is currently reading, and begins to read. As the minutes tick by, the girl notices eyes on her, “Jess” smiles to herself, letting out a chuckle as she thinks, ‘it feels good to be stared at. I have one amazing body, hehe… more amazing than other girls my age, and I am proud of and just love the way I look. I wonder how long it will take for a boy to approach me, mom doesn’t need to know, but I didn’t come to the park to read a book, the real reason I came here is to find a boyfriend. Every other girl my age has a boyfriend, so, I should have one too’.<br />
<br />
After two hours, “Jess” is about to give up hope, the girl lets out a sigh, ‘well, guess no luck today for me,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
“Jess” is about to put her book away, planning to head home, when she hears footsteps approaching her, “um… h-hey,” she then hears a young voice quietly say as the footsteps stop a foot away from her.<br />
<br />
Looking up “Jess” sees what appears to be a 12-year-old boy with short brown hair, brown eyes, a light brown skin tone and an athletic body, average for a 12-year-old, wearing a plain yellow t-shirt, blue jeans shorts and black sandals. “Jess” is immediately drawn to the boy, ‘whoa, he’s handsome,’ she thinks to herself, “hi,” she then says, “who are you?”<br />
<br />
The boy rubs the back of his head in a shy way, “s-sorry to bother you,” he says, even his voice has a shy tone to it, “my name is Juan Hernandez. I… I couldn’t help but notice you sitting all by yourself, I… I didn’t mean to interrupt your reading, but… um… I… I’m new here and… well… um… I… I’m trying to make some friends. M-may I join you?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” mentally giggles, ‘oh my, he’s so cute,’ she thinks to herself, the “girl” smiles, “sure, I’d be happy if you’d to join me”.<br />
<br />
The boy noticeably relaxes a little, smiling as he sits next to the girl, however not to close keeping a respective gap between them, “th-thanks,” he says, his voice still sounding nervous and shy.<br />
<br />
“Jess” once again mentally giggles, ‘I can tell that he finds me super attractive and he’s defiantly interested in me,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I must say, I already like him and his personality, he seems like a boy who respects other’s “private space” and doesn’t want to “intrude”. That is what I’m looking for, not only does he have an amazing body, he is also super handsome, and has an relaxing aura around him. I can sense that he’d treat me not only with respect, but with love too, I also feel really safe and secure in his presence, let’s see where this will lead’.<br />
<br />
“So… um…,” the boy says, “what’s… what’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” giggles, “no need to be so shy and nervous around me, Juan,” she says, smiling kindly, “my name is Jess, Jess Davis. By the sound of your name and appearance, I assume you, or at least your family, are from Mexico? Nice name, by the way”.<br />
<br />
“I always get shy and nervous around girls, especially around such… um… stunning girls like you,” Juan mumbles, blushing a little, “s-sorry… th-that was… um… to direct,” he then quickly adds.<br />
<br />
“Jess” giggles, “your too cute,” she says, smiling, “no need to apologize, I know that I am stunning! I do appreciate a boy who speaks his mind freely and doesn’t hide his feelings, I could already tell that you seem to find me attractive”.<br />
<br />
Juan rubs the back of his head, grinning a little, “I was never good at masking my true feelings,” he says, “and to answer your question, yes, my family is from Mexico, however, I was born here in the US. We just moved to this city due to my parents jobs”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” the “girl” says, “what do your parents work as?”<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, relaxing a little more when he notices that the girl seems to show interest, “my dad is a lawyer and my mom is a teacher”.<br />
<br />
“Oooh, interesting,” “Jess” says, “what type of lawyer is your dad?”<br />
<br />
“He’s an real estate attorney,” Juan says, unable to hide his pride.<br />
<br />
“Jess’s” eyes widen, “whoa, that is one of the most highest paying lawyers jobs, you guys must be super rich!”<br />
<br />
Juan rubs the back of his head, grinning, “well… not wanting to boast… but… yeah, we kinda are,” he says.<br />
<br />
‘AND he is rich,’ “Jess” thinks to herself, ‘I’d really be a fool if I don’t get him!’<br />
<br />
“Jess,” Juan asks.<br />
<br />
“Jess” blinks, “oh… sorry, Juan,” she says, smiling, “I was just imagining the palace you must live in”.<br />
<br />
Juan chuckles, relaxing completely, “we aren’t THAT rich,” he says, “but… yeah, we do live in a big house, but we try to not boast about it. As you can see, I am not even wearing expensive clothes, and we don’t look down on people who are… sorry in advance… less fortunate”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles, “that is a wonderful mindset you and your folks have,” she says, moving a little closer to the boy, “tell me more about you and your family”.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, ‘looks like I’m in luck… finally,’ he thinks to himself, “well, my parents are involved in lots of charities, especially towards helping children, teens and families who need help”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles wider, “that’s really amazing of you,” she says, “I bet you have helped so many families and people”.<br />
<br />
Juan nods, “we have,” he says, “that’s what makes us different from all the other… rich folks”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” nods, “yeah, the majority of rich and wealthy people tend to be… well… cold to put it mildly”.<br />
<br />
Juan frowns and nods, “yeah, I think it’s mean,” he says, “I mean… why should we rich people have it better than the rest? Everyone deserves a chance, and if we are able to help them make the first step, and they take the chance, then we made the world a little better”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles, ‘I’m falling in love with Juan more and more,’ she thinks to herself, “tell me about yourself”.<br />
<br />
“Well, at school, when I see someone being mean to someone who is poor, I step in and defend them,” Juan says, he then rolls his eyes, “the other rich kids tend to avoid me,” he then grins, “BUT I don’t care, at least I have REAL friends, right?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles and nods, “yeah, you do,” she says, “those kids you help, they must feel grateful to you”.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles and nods, “they do, I even invite them home,” he says, chuckling, “they are all so nervous and scared at first, but it doesn&#39;t take long for them to feel relaxed, especially after meeting my parents”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” can’t stop smiling, “you and your family really are amazing,” she says, “it surprises me that you haven’t yet found a girlfriend”.<br />
<br />
Juan’s eyes widen, “how… how do you know that I am single?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” giggles, “oh, just of the way you approached and started talking to me,” she says, “you were so shy and nervous, and I could tell that you find me attractive. You wouldn’t act like that if you were in a relationship”.<br />
<br />
“He… looks like you are not easy to be fooled, hm?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” grins, “nope, you’d need to try harder,” she chuckles, she then leans in closer, “by the way: I’m single myself,” she whispers, giving Juan a smile and wink.<br />
<br />
Juan’s eyes widen, “y-you… you don’t mean…,” he stammers.<br />
<br />
“Jess” giggles, “oh… I sure do,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Bu-but why… why me,” Juan asks.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get me wrong, Juan,” the “girl” says, “a part of why I want to be your girlfriend, is that you are rich, BUT… that is not the main reason”.<br />
<br />
“What is it then? If not the… money?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles, “you,” she says, “your personality and what you told me about yourself and your family, THAT is what hooked me”.<br />
<br />
“B-but… you don’t even know my interests, and… and I know nothing about you yet,” Juan says.<br />
<br />
“Jess” reaches out a hand and closes it around Juan’s, the boy looks down, then back up at the “girl”, “then… let’s get to know each other,” she says, smiling.<br />
<br />
Juan is still in shock and surprise, but then he smiles, closing his hand around “Jess’s”, “I can’t wait to learn everything about you and your family, Jess,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Jess” giggles, “and you WILL learn everything about me and my family,” she says, “but… first, I want to know more about you, so… tell me: what are your interests? You look as though you do a lot of sports”.<br />
<br />
Juan nods, moving closer to “Jess”, the gap between them slowly closing, “I do,” the boy says, “I play soccer and basketball, but the most thing I enjoy is doing parkour”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles, “that explains your amazing athletic body, at least from what I am able to see,” she says, her eyes moving up and down the boy’s body.<br />
<br />
Juan chuckles, “I promise you, Jess,” he says, “if… if this should really work out between us…,” he trails off, blushing.<br />
<br />
“Jess” giggles, blushing herself, “he… I guess I am JUST as bad in hiding my feelings and thoughts as you are”.<br />
<br />
Juan chuckles, “a perfect match,” he says, his eyes then widen as he looks at “Jess”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” simply smiles, “yes… I agree,” she says, moving closer to Juan, closing the gab between them, causing their legs and hips to touch each other.<br />
<br />
Juan gulps and fidgets a little when he feels his three inch flaccid penis twitch, “s-so… do… um… do you do sports,” he asks awkwardly, blushing a little.<br />
<br />
“Jess” grins, “am I making you feel uncomfortable?”<br />
<br />
Juan quickly shakes his head, “n-no… I… it’s…,” he stammers.<br />
<br />
“Jess” smirks, lying a hand on Juan’s leg, “it’s what… Juan,” she whispers.<br />
<br />
Juan lets out a whimper when his cock erects a little more, “n-not helping,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
“Jess” giggles, removing her hand, “sorry, couldn’t resist!”<br />
<br />
Juan pouts at the “girl”, “mean tease!”<br />
<br />
“Jesse” sticks out her tongue, “just a taste of me being your girlfriend,” she says, grinning, “and to answer your question: yes, I do sports, I also enjoy parkour but I also do cheerleading at my school,” this, of course, is not true, but due to Zoey’s mental manipulation, the program simply “decided” to give “Jess”, as she ages up, the mindset of a girl suiting her current age. By now, three hours have passed, causing “Jess” to age up a year from 11 to 12, however, neither Juan nor “Jess” seem to notice.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, “that is so cool, a girl that does parkour,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Not only do I enjoy parkour,” the “girl” says, “I also enjoy playing video games!”<br />
<br />
Juan smirks, “you seem to be quiet the “tom-boy”,” he chuckles, “but I don’t mind, I do prefer more boyish girls… girly-girls are just sooooo… annoying!”<br />
<br />
“Jess” laughs, “yeah, they are,” she says, the “girl” is about to ask Juan what type of movies he likes to watch, when suddenly her phone rings, “oh, that must be my mom,” she says. The “girl” reaches into her handbag and answers the call.<br />
<br />
“Jess, it’s getting late,” Zoey says, “time you come home”.<br />
<br />
“Sorry mom, I just met someone and forgot the time,” “Jess” says, looking at Juan.<br />
<br />
“Oh, who did you meet,” Zoey asks.<br />
<br />
“A boy, his name is Juan,” the “girl” says, still holding the boy’s hand as she smiles at him, “do… do you mind if I bring him along?”<br />
<br />
“Well… would he want to?”<br />
<br />
“Um… Juan… would you like to come with me to my place?”<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, “sure, let me just call my folks and ask if it’s okay”.</p>
