<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There names were Mazy and Rose, theis two young women were in the service of Lady Willow, they had been for many years, but as the human and Fey worlds continued to clash they knew it was only a matter of time.<br />
<br />
They did not want to fight, but they knew without a proper reason, they would have no choice, but as they gazed into the throneroom at their mistress, they also saw the young baby in her arms, happily feeding from her breast, and in him the young servants saw their escape.<br />
<br />
Now Mazy and Rose had no intention of betraying their mistress, she had been good to all her people for many a year, always putting the people before herself, and everyone loved her for that, but Mazy and Rose could see no other option to stay out of the fighting, after all, their mistress would never force her people to fight.... but the queen would.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure we can do this Rose?, I mean going behind lady Willow&#39;s back hurts enough as it is, but I don&#39;t realy see any other option, the human army at the border grows by the day, its now or never&quot; said Mazy as she looked in the mirror, preparing for bed.<br />
<br />
Her hair was chocolate brown, tied in a bun, her eyes were kind and gentle, glowing with a warm orange colour, her skin was smooth and pail, like freshly fallen snow, and her cheeks were rosy and pink, she wore a loose fitting white night gown, with a low V neck design to accommodate her large assets, ohh her breasts, they had serenity grown over the past week, but then again, Rose was no better, but it was what had to be done to continue their plan.<br />
<br />
Rose gave a groan as she stood infront of her own mirror, gazing down at what was once her almost flat chest, she had never been a busty girl, but now she looked and felt like a prize winning dairy cow, watching as a steady flow of milk draped from her dark nipples, her creamy white skin around her breasts showing no signs of veins or iritation, Rose then gave a sigh as she pulled up her night gown and tied her inky black hair up, before turning to answer Mazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if the gilt will crush us or not my love, but we have no other option, I just hope our research and theory is correct, and I pray to the gods that Lady Willow will forgive us&quot; said Rose sadly, as they sat on their bed, awaiting the midnight hour.<br />
<br />
Willow lay in her private quarters, her room was round, bark covering the walls, with a large circular glass roof showing the night sky above, her walk in wardrobe doors were to her left, the arch matching the walls perfectly as roots seemed to sprout from the archway, burying themselves the wall, Willow&#39;s bed was a large oak tree in the center of her room, the bottom of its trunk hollowed out to create a headboard and canopy, its roots wrapping around the front of it to encircle a large white mattress, it&#39;s sheets and pillows strewn across its surface as the land of the wood rested on her bed.<br />
<br />
Then a familiar cry caught her attention, looking to her right she saw her Prince in his crib, she had fashioned it herself, it was a treestump, with wicker and Willow woven to create a basket on the top of the stump that sat flush against the side of her bed, wich allowed both her and her son to be bathed in the moonlight upon the midnight hour.<br />
<br />
Willow sighed and rolled over to scoop up her crying Prince &quot;awww, my sweet boy, hungry are we?&quot; She cooed to her baby boy, who waisted no time in latching on to his mother&#39;s breast, eagerly pulling on her sensetive nipple to get the milk he so desperately needed, Willow gave a yelp in shock from her sons eagerness, before she began stroking his head &quot;shhhhh nghh not so hard with mommy baby, take your time, I&#39;m not going anywhere&quot; she whispered, watching with a smile as her sons eyes began to droop as he fed, his pace slowing down as mother and son enjoyed their closeness.<br />
<br />
Then there was a knock on her door &quot;come in&quot; called Willow, the door did not open right away as whispered could be herd outside, fear began to creep up Willow&#39;s spine as she waited for the door to open, just as she was about to call her hards the door opened, and in stepped Rose and Mazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ladies it&#39;s just you.. you had me worried for a moment that we had some uninvited guests&quot; she chuckled, placing her hand over her beating heart to slow its pace, Rose and Mazy gave a small laugh, &quot;sorry to scare you at this hour my lady, but we have a request to ask of you, and it cannot wait until morning&quot; said Rose looking down at the floor, fiddling with the string of her nightgown.<br />
<br />
Willow not being one to deny her people a request of her simply smiled &quot;of corse girl&#39;s, after all what&#39;s mine is yours, we are all members of the western wood after all, and what is taken from the forest is passed among the people no matter their social rank or progression&quot; said Willow with a smile as she sat up, now cross leged with her hands still cradling her baby, awaiting her serpents request.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your ladyship we ummmm...we&quot; stuttered Rose as a tear escaped down her cheek &quot;we need your baby&quot; she said as she stuck out her hand and began chanting in the ancient tongue, Willow was to confused at what was happening to move or speak, what did they mean they needed her baby, she didn&#39;t understand.<br />
<br />
But then as she looked down she saw that where her son one was, was now a glowing blue gem, floating infront of her, the sound of her baby&#39;s cryes echoing from within &quot;What are you doing.... WHAT HAVE YOU DONW TO MY BABY!!&quot; screamed Willow as she attempted to reach for her son&#39;s gem, only to find that she could not move, it was like time had stoped as she remained frozen in place.<br />
<br />
But upon looking into Mazy and Rose&#39;s eyes she saw nothing but pain, sadness, guilt, they got no joy from this, so why would they do this, but then Willow watched in horror as her son&#39;s gem began to ripple like liquid before splitting into two identical gems, his cryes now sounding like an echo as the sound now came from both gems, her son had just been rippled.<br />
<br />
A forbidden type of magic that allowed the user to basically clone a person, but the clone was always found dead by the original within the first week, so the council had deemed it too dangerous for any spell caster to use, yet here two of Willow&#39;s serpents were, using it on her only son, but before she could scream at the two girl&#39;s for even considering this kind of sorcery, two beams of moonlight hit the gems.<br />
<br />
Willow watched in horrified fascination as the gems Inc again began to ripple, fearing another divide she looked away, tears streaming down her cheeks, but what no sound could be herd, she looked back up to see the gems had changed shape, now both of the gems were perfecty round see-through balls, around the size of a chickens egg, but what surprised Willow was the little shapes within the gems, almost like......a two week old fetus.<br />
<br />
Immediately Willow knew what was going on, watching in horror as Rose and Mazy took eachothers hands, and the orbs began to drift over towards them, all she could do was watch as the two girl&#39;s began shaking with fear, tears continuing to fall as the gems aproched their lower abdomens, but then instead of the orbs simply passing through into them, Willow watched in horror as steam began to rise as they passed into the girl&#39;s abdomens, watching as their faces scrunched up in pain as the orbs finished paying through.<br />
<br />
Willow was both scared for the girl&#39;s safety and for her son&#39;s, as she guessed that the pain and steam was not supposed to happen with this spell, then all of a sudden she fell forward, her tits and her mattress cushioning her fall as she was once again free to move, upon looking up she saw Rose and Mazy clutching over ther slightly swolen womb, steam still leaking through the gaps in their fingers, &quot;were sorry my lady&quot; croaked Rose before she and Mazy collapsed in a heap on the floor....</p>
