<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the kids were getting ready for the school. Nick was talking to Jane in there room about what he said early in the kitchen and how he was sorry  he brought it up and that he would never do that to one of his children and how he felt sick from the thought. He just wished his family was like any normal family. But if that happened we would probably never of met or be created, Jane said sitting on the end of the bed staring at him lovingly. Nick agreed with her on that. he couldn&#39;t fathom how life would be without his family. He walked over to his wife leaned over grabbing the back of her head and kissed her long and passionately pushing her back onto the bed. Laying on top of her he crest her. Moving his hands all over her body unlike he has before more passionately like a rough gentleness. Lifting her up and flipping her on top of him. They started stripping with no care in the world. Like a blazing inferno the heat between them was so intense it could set the room on fire. What they didn&#39;t know was this was the heightened libido kicking in and or if they did they didn&#39;t care. <br />
<br />
The kids snuck out of the house hearing their parents making love. Grabbing a set of keys as they when out the door and drove to school. On there way to school the conversation of there father&#39;s Second Puberty came up, how there lives are going to change, and how more careful Gean would have to be around his father because the changes seem to be coming coming faster then the doctor though. Then they all thought and talked about  how that sex might make the changes come faster as well. how right they were even if they didn&#39;t know it yet.<br />
<br />
While Nick and Jane were making love. Changes were happening he was loosing mass and heighth soon they were the same height. Nick shrank from 6&#39;3 to 5&#39;9 just 2 inches from his new height. his original weight was 256 pounds to 180 pounds. With them to entranced in there passionate love making they didn&#39;t notice the changes in his height and weight. Some hair growth and body hair loss plus a more feminine face. Not till after they were done till they noticed. After seeing the all the changes they could. They called the doctor for them to come in. they got dressed and went. Nick had to barrow some clothes from his son&#39;s wardrobe. Once at the doctors more tests were taken since it was a rush the doctor&#39;s office did have a small lab they used. The results came back in 3 hours. during that time Nick called his boss to tell them what was going on and how he needed a few days maybe weeks off. His boss understood the severity of the situation and passed it through the proper channels. His boss got back to him saying that everything was done and for him to take all the time he needs till he can come back to work.<br />
<br />
After getting back home from the doctors with some new paperwork saying it would now only be 2 to 3 weeks till he is fully a girl. They called the school to them the news and to let their kids know. And the school told them if the kids wanted to come home it was okay and they would allow it. The kids rush home to see their father&#39;s condition and to be there for him. Before the kids left the school they had to sign out and told them to mail their homework to the house. The kids burst through the door to see their father and mother. They embraced each other when they seen their father. Collapsing to their knees and tears filling their eyes. After a while the family composed themselves and sat down in the living room around the coffee table to talk. The parents told the kids what the doctor said and of their plans for their father&#39;s changes  and at its new determined rate.<br />
<br />
Nick and Jane were talking before before the kids got home about how there might need to be a new living arrangement and that both of them concluded that it would probably be best if he slept in the office/guest bedroom/craft room till the changes were finished. They both knew it would be hard on them but they didn&#39;t want what happened earlier happen again. And when the kids get home they&#39;d tell them. Nick got the room ready for himself with Jane&#39;s help. He wasn&#39;t nearly as strong nor as tall as he once was so he appreciated it and it showed. Once done with the room they decided to have a celebratory drink for all the hard work they put in. The room looked more like a storage locker more then anything. So the drink was well deserved.<br />
