<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I decided that I needed a few bucks for some odds and ends which were never enough for mom's budget or my allowance. Most of my friends had jobs to make their money. I have something better; wishes.
<br />
 The First Bank of Unionville was an obvious choice. It was the only bank in town and in the words of Willie Sutton &quot;that's where the money is.&quot;
<br />
  Now, I know that it would be easier to say &quot;I wish for a million dollars&quot; and there it would be at my feet. Sometimes what's easiest is also the most boring. Besides, the money is indidental. It's the ability to make wishes to change people into things is what is important. I have to admit, changing my mom into a teenager and Ms. Barnes into a baby kind of gave me a thrill. It's time to see how much of a thrill it will give me to change people on a larger scale.
<br />
  Before entering the bank, I made all the cameras disappear. No fun having my antics being videotaped. No reason to make my power known to the rest of the world, including the police and the F.B.I..
<br />
  I walked inside and looked around to see if the cameras were really gone. Nope, nothing there. I looked around and scoped the bank to see who was around. 
<br />
  There were three bank tellers, standing behind three inches of bulletproof glass, two other bank employees sitting at desks. They were probably in charge of new accounts and loans. On line were five people; an old couple; a man in a hard hat and dirty jeans; a twenty-something in a black skirt and white blouse and a girl about sixteen or seventeen. The girl was dressed like Britney Spears, complete with belly shirt and flayed cuffed jeans. Very cute.
<br />
  There was also a bank guard standing on the far side of the bank. He was looking at me blandly. No way could I be a bank robber. I couldn't drive the getaway car. He yawned and streached his arms up and out. He was ready to call it a day. All the standing can wipe you out. Well, in a second, he wouldn't have that problem.
<br />
  
<br />
  I didn't do much. I closed my eyes and thought that I wanted them to become infants for fifteen minutes and have them put back on their clothes and forget what happened to them. 
<br />
  When I opened them the first thing I saw was all the people in the bank starting to twitch, like the floor was giving them light charges of electricity. Then, the most amazing thing I have ever seen started to happen...they started to change. It was subtle at first. The old couple on line, their hair started to darken and their bodies seemed to rise up. Now this would be noticed by most people, under normal circumstances. But no one noticed because they were undergoing their own transformations.
<br />
  The man in the hard hat, the hat slid off his head and clattered to the floor. His jeans began to bunch around his legs as twenty years slipped away from him. The woman in the skirt and blouse also lost some years. Her skirt had already fallen to the floor. Her white blouse hung loosely off her flattening chest and began to creep to her feet. The Britney Spears wanna be was already crawling around, her clothes were left in a loose pile behind her.
<br />
  The security guard, who was probably in his sixties was now a spry thrity-five but it didn't stop there. Suddenly he was twenty-five, then fifteen. His gun belt slid from his narrowing hips which his pants soon followed.
<br />
  Also entering their early teens were the two bank employees at their desks. They just slid off their chairs and finished their transformation under their desks. They joined the tellers who had already disappeared behind the counters. I could hear their hungry cries, even behind the plexiglass.
<br />
  The last to become infants were the old couple at the head of the line. They shrunk into their clothes and two bald heads peeked out at me. They both giggled toothlessly at me as I walked by them towards the partition that was probably locked but that's not a problem.
<br />
  I admired my handiwork. Very fucking cool.They all had turned into babies, just like Ms Barnes. I walked past what were once walking and talking people. Now they were staring at me with their bright eyes, drool running down their chins. I just hoped none of them decided to go to the bathroom. 
<br />
  Quickly. I removed some of the money from the cash drawers. I didn't take much, around two thousand dollars. No need to be greedy. I carefully stepped around the regressed tellers, two of which were sleeping, nestled in their clothes. Awwwwww.
<br />
  Then going back to the floor, I took another passing glance at what I had done and was just to go out the door when I saw...</p>
