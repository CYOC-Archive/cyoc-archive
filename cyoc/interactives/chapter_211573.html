<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Uhhh….” Jeff swallowed and blurted out the first job that came to mind. “Accountant!”<br />
<br />
There was a click and whir from the machine, along with a steadily building hum as something inside of it powered up. Jeff waited with baited breath as the machine processed his request. Even Mr. Walters was eyeing the machine, a slight frown on his face. Had his Principal wanted him to get defaulted?!<br />
<br />
“Occupation selected.” The machine dinged cheerily. “Accountant-Using Default Accountant stats.”<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed in relief. At least he’d managed to choose his occupation. Anyways, accountant was a solid choice. They got paid really well and-<br />
<br />
“Default stats are:…” The machine continued in a perky tone. “…Homosexual. Overweight. Bald. Small Penis. Bad Eyesight. Drinker. Smoker.” <br />
<br />
“What?!” Jeff’s eyes bulged in horror. “How are those the fucking defaults?”<br />
<br />
“Hahahaha!” Mr. Walters gave a belly laugh. “Sorry to tell you, but you took too long to decide. Have a nice molding!”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters was still laughing as he left the room. Jeff heard the door lock. His heart pounded in terror as he heard the humming noise within the machine begin to build, the barrel of what looked like a laser attached to a robotic arm on the machine swiveling and pointing at his head.<br />
<br />
Jeff struggled in the restraints. They were only Velcro, but they were surprisingly tight and difficult to escape from. He tugged and tugged, hearing the machine above him powering up. Across the room was a sink with a metal paper towel dispense. He could see the machine’s LED display in the reflection, and saw it counting down. 59…58…57…<br />
<br />
He cursed and tugged harder. Jeff shot a quick glance at the countdown, noticing the humming grow louder. 49…48…47...He yanked and yanked and heard something give. The Velcro strap felt much looser now. Jeff checked and noticed the plastic ‘eye’ the Velcro had been threaded to had deformed, the plastic stretching. He clenched his teeth and pulled his arm. With a snap, the Velcro cuff came loose. <br />
<br />
Jeff quickly reached over to his other arm and undid the strap. He got to his feet and went to the door. Locked. He glanced at the LED. 14…13…12…Shit! No time.<br />
<br />
He looked around frantically for someplace to hide. The room was mostly empty save for the machine with the laser barrel, which was still targeting him in spite of his escape. Maybe rip off the metal towel dispenser, deflect the laser? No, that wouldn’t work, it was screwed to the wall.<br />
<br />
The humming was building to a crescendo. Jeff’s eyes fell on the one thing in the room big enough for him to hide behind…..the chair he’d been strapped to!<br />
<br />
3..2…1…<br />
<br />
Jeff dove behind the chair just as the beam fired. It was red and warm where it caught the top of his head. Jeff knelt close behind the chair, pressing himself to it so the beam had no target. The tingling receded the moment he was out of the beam’s sight. With a shaking hand, he reached up and found his hair thinner at the top of his head where the beam hit him, loose hairs floating away to the floor. <br />
<br />
The beam hit the chair and the leather started growing warm, warping as the transformative ray did its work. <br />
<br />
Jeff could only watch in horror as he saw the form that the machine had intended for him. The arms of the chair slowly plumped, the leather softening into pale white skin, Pudgy hands appeared, a forest of hair trailing from the knuckles and top of the hand, thick and long, and traveled up the arm in tandem with the path of the laser.<br />
<br />
The beam moved in methodical fashion, traveling around the chair’s prone form. It cut across the body of the chair, moving towards the legs. The chair warped and swelled, a chest and pecs plopping out into existence, growing huge and thick with soft fat before sagging into a rather hairy gut and moobs. It got to the legs and they stuck together, growing into two fat limbs with cankles.<br />
<br />
Jeff pressed himself tighter to the chair as it transformed. As the beam moved towards the crotch of the new accountant, Jeff had to control his breathing so the machine wouldn’t detect him. The leather against his face grew warm and began to swell. He soon found his face pressed between two pillowy mounds of flesh.<br />
<br />
With a mix of disgust and horror, he realized his face was wedged in the chair-turned accountant’s ass crack. He wanted to pull away, but moving at this point would expose him to the laser. So he kept still, praying the laser would move on to the last thing that remained unchanged, the headrest.<br />
<br />
He stared in morbid fascination, a pleasant warmth engulfing his face, as the flesh in front of him began to swirl and sink in on itself, forming an asshole. Jeff let out his breath and breathed in the smell of musk as the skin in the crevice began to pucker and clench. The smell was oddly…pleasant, deep and robust and rather earthy. <br />
<br />
An urge struck him. <br />
<br />
What did an asshole taste like?  It was a chair, the asshole should be completely clean, after all. What would a little taste hurt? His face throbbed gently as his pressed deeper into the forming ass crack, his tongue extended. He gave the new hole a lick, savoring the organ’s flavor.<br />
<br />
The flesh around him was growing hairy, Jeff’s 5 o’clock shadow bristling against it. It nice and warm here, the hole a little moist. The space between the swelling ass was growing a bit tight, so Jeff reached his hands up, gripping the flabby flesh firmly and spread the cheeks wide, giving him better access.  The warmth intensified and the waves of pleasure rolling across his face seemed to only increase as he ate that hot ass out. <br />
<br />
He sucked and lapped at the ass, kissing it with his rubbery lips, his jowls slowly sagging as he did. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s tongue drilled deeper as pleasant tingles continued to engulf his head. A hair fell on his nose, making it twitch. He brushed it away as more hair began to fall around him. His hand reached up and brushed more stray hairs off the top of his severely receded hairline. That should have bothered him, but the ass in front of Jeff had his full attention. <br />
<br />
The warmth and tingles started to fade as the beam moved away, up towards the headrest of the chair. Jeff kept lapping at the twitching pucker, hoping the hot guy the chair was turning into would appreciate it. He’d love it if it were him. Afterwards, he’d have himself a beer and a cigarette and just relax on the couch…<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mind stumbled a bit at that. It sounded pleasant but oddly…wrong. Did he even like the taste of ass? The body above him twitched to life, drawing its first breath. Jeff gave the hole a light sniff and the deeply musky aroma rather appealing. He gave it another lick and swished his tongue around, finding the savory flavor rather satisfying. <br />
<br />
He heard the naked hairy man above him moan in pleasure. <br />
<br />
The man turned his head, glancing behind him, eyes focusing on Jeff. He was bald, only a ring of shaved hair left, and obviously overweight, with sagging jowls and a doublechin that even the beard he’d grown out couldn’t conceal. All in all, a rather handsome middle aged man. With a smile, Jeff lapped at the hole again, his short beard rubbing the side of the man’s ass.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, yeah, that feels good!” The man groaned, reaching behind him and placing his hand on Jeff’s bald patch, rubbing it and pressing him deeper into his crack. “Keep going!”<br />
<br />
Wait, his bald patch? Had he always been bald? Jeff was confused but with the pudgy hand on the back of his head, he could only eat that ass out with gusto. The man above him moaned happily and Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit hot about the hole thing. <br />
<br />
“Physical and mental changes completed.” The machine’s cheery, mechanical voice echoed in the room. “Applying proper attire.”<br />
<br />
Jeff continued pleasuring the obese man as the laser moved from his head-where a pair of thick glasses appeared-then continued down his body, laser-printing a button down shirt and vest. The pleasant warmth and gentle wave of tingles enveloped Jeff’s head again as the laser targeted the obese man’s crotch. He pulled away as a pair of tightie whities wrapped itself around the man’s crotch and a pair of slacks painted itself on the man’s ass, a belt slithering into place and securing it to his hips. <br />
<br />
While the man unbuckled his belt, Jeff adjusted his glasses. As the man shifted to get his pants down, Jeff was momentarily exposed. While the obese guy fumbled with the belt buckle, the laser finished crafting his slacks and shoes. The machine whirred and clicked, swiveling to and fro before centering on him.<br />
<br />
“Resuming molding.” The machine spoke cheerily.<br />
<br />
Dimly, Jeff heard the machine speak. He wondered what else about the man needed to be changed. The man continued fumbling his belt and Jeff sighed impatiently. There was a hum, and then a red light illuminated his face. <br />
<br />
It was soothing and gentle, making his face tingle pleasurably. The back of his neck tickled and Jeff reached back, ruffling and dislodging the last of the hair on his head, leaving him rubbing a smooth, bald dome. Jeff moaned as the gentle waves envelop his face, making his cheeks puff a bit further, crow’s feet etching themselves into the corners of his eyes and wrinkles furrowing his brow.<br />
<br />
The tingles engulfed his brain, making Jeff shiver. He felt tired as thoughts of spreadsheets and tax write offs filled his mind. There was something off about that, but the pleasant waves gently massaged his worries away, shaping them into lust for the hot obese man in front of him.  Jeff sighed, happy the bear seemed so eager to fuck. He let himself relax, his mind washed away by gentle ripples of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Yeah, after sucking this guy off, he’d definitely be getting a smoke.<br />
<br />
The beam moved lower down his neck, and Jeff’s face was pulled with it, sagging a bit. His chin swelled with fat and his Adam’s apple grew more prominent. Further and further it went, hair tickling as it sprouted along the path of the beam. His nipples puffed and enlarged, hair ringing them, then spreading across his chest as it filled with fat. The beam continued lower, dragging his breasts down as they sagged into moobs.<br />
<br />
It swept down to his belly and his stomach tingled nicely as it bloated under the warm light. Jeff burped softly as a feeling of fullness enveloped him. He reached down and pressed his fingers into the pliable fat, his hands plumping as the light enveloped them. His belly swelled larger and larger until it sagged into a rather large, hairy beer belly. <br />
<br />
The light drifted lower, centering on his crotch.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned as the warm red light gently pressed his cock back into him in waves. His proud seven-incher was slowly reduced to three inches long, tingling as it shrunk under the light of the ray. The light tucked his small cock under his belly, a fold of fat slumping over it and his groin engulfing it. Once his dick was snugly nestled in a cradle of lard, the beam moved to his balls. Jeff moaned as they bloated and sagged. There was something wrong with this, but it all felt so good, how could he-<br />
<br />
And then the obese man stepped in front of the light, his pants down, his own small cock dribbling precum. <br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, the warmth receding and his thoughts clearing. What had just happened? He’d been watching the hot bear struggle with his belt. Then a weird light had hit him and-<br />
<br />
“Target lost. Attempting to reacquire.” A cheery, robotic voice said.<br />
<br />
Panic overwhelmed the pleasure as Jeff realized he’d been hit by the beam. His mind was telling him his fat and sagging form was normal, but he knew, logically, the laser had hit him. He needed to get out of here!<br />
<br />
“Hey, uh,” Jeff cleared his throat, sounding rather froggy. “Can you stay still, that laser makes me nervous.”<br />
<br />
“Making you nervous, huh?” The man chuckled and adjusted his glasses. “I think it’s making you rather handsome.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed. “Still, I’d feel more comfortable if you blocked it for me.”<br />
<br />
The man glanced from the laser, which was scanning for targets, the arm swiveling to and fro, and then to Jeff. He smiled mischievously. Then he moved out of the way of the ray, letting out a hearty chuckle.<br />
<br />
“I think you’ll look even better when it’s done.” The man laughed, his doublechin shaking.<br />
<br />
“Target reacquired!” The laser announced, the robotic arm swiveling so the muzzle of the bun was pointed at Jeff. “Finishing transformation!”<br />
<br />
Jeff staggered to his feet and stumbled away from the laser. He could hear the hum of the laser building back up again, the lights flickering as it drew even more power.  The laser was focusing on his stomach again, Jeff realized.<br />
<br />
As the hum built up to full power, Jeff jumped out of the way. <br />
<br />
The red-colored ray lanced out and missed. Jeff panted heavily, all the extra weight he’d just acquired slowing him down. The machine hummed, powering up for another shot. Jeff backed up and bumped against the wall.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Jeff cried, glancing behind him, and realized that his voice thicker and deeper.<br />
<br />
“Warning. Movement during Molding Process could have unforeseen effects. Please stay still.” The machine cheerfully informed him.<br />
<br />
“Screw you!” Jeff spat.<br />
<br />
“...Acknowledged.” The machine’s voice sounded…icy.<br />
<br />
The hum built to a crescendo. There was nowhere for him to hide! The beam fired and Jeff attempted to jump out of the way.<br />
<br />
It hit him in the crotch.<br />
<br />
The beam was no longer gentle, a loud *WUM* *WUM* *WUM* emitting from the machine. Jeff was knocked to the ground by the sheer force and lay there, legs spread, as waves of energy engulfed his groin. It was intensely pleasurable, and Jeff found he couldn’t move if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
His ill-fitting clothing disintegrated, fabric shredding away. <br />
<br />
Jeff gasped as the beam hit his bare cock. It plumped and grew, lengthening almost a foot and a half long. He wanted to touch it, stroke it, but the pleasure and force of the beam kept him from moving. All he could do was twitch his fingers and curl his toes.<br />
<br />
The head-and only the head-began to grow. Larger and larger, the spongy tissue solidifying. Hair began to ring the crown of the cock, leaving the top bare and exposed. Jeff blinked as he saw indentations begin to form, ridges rise on the bloated tip of his distended dong. It almost looked like…a human head.<br />
<br />
With mounting horror, Jeff watched eyeballs form in the indentations-the sockets-of the firming skull. He felt panic rise in his chest, but only for a few moments. The constant, all-consuming pleasure washed it away, so intense he almost forgot about why he was worried.<br />
<br />
As the beam finished off the new head of a fat, balding man who looked strikingly similar to the guy whose ass he was just eating, the beam moved to his limbs. His legs went first, thick ham-hocks thinning slightly, knees popping and becoming elbows, feet becoming dexterous hands. Then his arms went next, hands losing their dexterity and becoming feet, wrist billowing with fat, becoming cankles. Jeff found himself wedged between two thick thighs.<br />
<br />
The beam hit his chest. Moobs slid down towards his new head, a beach-ball sized belly swelling just beneath Jeff’s chin. He wanted to protest, but everything felt so good. His head was pressed back the larger his gut swelled, neck nestling into a forming fat gunt.<br />
<br />
“It’ll be fine.” An eerily recognizable voice spoke from below him. “You’ll love being a cock. “<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to crane his neck to see the speaker’s face, but his movement was too limit. He could only see the swell of his hairy gut. A pudgy hand reached down under the gut and rubbed Jeff’s head. Jeff moaned, the touch igniting his pleasure centers further.<br />
<br />
“That’s it. All a cock feels is pleasure.” The hand stroked Jeff’s bald head. “Doesn’t that feel good?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, rubbing his face against the hand. The machine whirred and hummed, the loud *WUM* fading, as the beam moved and Jeff feel the red light engulf him. Thought the pleasure lessened, the warmth and tingles filled his mind again. The hand rubbed him again and heat surged through him.<br />
<br />
He moaned, drool dribbling out of his mouth. The hand stroked and teased him, playing with his lips as they plumped thick and full. A thumb reached out and began rubbing his nose. The cartilage slowly collapsed under the touch. A feeling of vertigo struck him. Fat thighs rose up around him and Jeff realized he was shrinking. <br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to panic but then the warm, gentle wave of pleasant energy engulfed his brain. His thoughts shifted towards the bear’s hole. The taste of it, the smell. He wanted nothing more than to be inside of it once again. The throb of the beam filled his mind and Jeff drooled even harder, the taste sweet now.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrunk under the accountant’s belly, the soft, warm fat of his gunt almost welcoming. He twitched needily as he was gently nestled into the fat pubic mound. That nice warm hand descended and rubbed him so nicely. Jeff closed his eyes, the throbs beginning to block his thoughts. He felt pleasurable throbs, but trying to think when he was so hard and needful was difficult. <br />
<br />
The red light switched off. <br />
<br />
Immediately, the pleasant warmth and tingles receded. Jeff found himself coming back to reality. The fat man he was attached to continued to rub him. With rising panic, Jeff realized that not only was he a cock-he was completely aware of it. The true horror of his situation came to him, then. He was stuck as a fat accountant’s small dick for the rest of his life!<br />
<br />
All he could do was twitch and drool and enjoy the gentle tugs the man above him gave.<br />
<br />
“Analyzing,” A cheery voice spoke, “Subjects will perform their assigned roles.”<br />
<br />
“Well, aren’t you sexy.” A deep voice said.<br />
<br />
“Heh, could say the same about you big guy.” Jeff’s body replied. <br />
<br />
His body moved and he found himself jostled as the fat accountant waddled over to the other fat accountant. He heard kissing sound, a hand-not his own-reaching down and fondling him. Jeff found the gentle strokes and tugs rather…pleasing, actually. He found himself growing rigid under the fat accountant’s tender ministrations and drooled.<br />
<br />
Was…was he really enjoying this?<br />
<br />
The man knelt down and all Jeff could see was a moist mouth just before it engulfed him. He felt a tongue lap at him, swirl him, gently suck at his head. It was all Jeff could do to hold on to himself, not let his mind be washed away by the pleasure. It was disgusting being used like this. It was violating to be touched… played with. The bear began to bob, more and more of Jeff entering that warm, moist mouth. The suction increased and Jeff groaned.<br />
<br />
Not a cock, Jeff thought, in spite of the tingles and suctions on his head. I’m not some small cock! This is a nightmare; it has to be. I’ll wake up any second now. I’ll wake up in my bed and I can leave this all behind me. I’ll just count to 3… 1, 2… <br />
<br />
“Anomaly detected.” The machine announced cheerfully. “Analyzing…Parameters adjusted. Defaults altered to better Mold subject. Correcting.”<br />
<br />
The mouth withdrew, leaving Jeff wet with saliva and precum. A warm red light bathed him once again. Jeff twitched in fear, wondering what new horrors and humiliations awaited him. <br />
<br />
Instead of shrinking him into a nub however, the light gently tugged him forward. <br />
<br />
Jeff moaned inwardly as the warm red light made him swell to full erection. His head began to swell as the waves of pleasure pulled him further and further out of the cozy gunt he’d been nestled in. His shaft thickened as he grew larger.<br />
<br />
Why was he getting so big?<br />
<br />
As the head of his dick swelled ever larger, he grew dizzy. He could tell he was at least ten thick inches long now. A blood vessel wormed its way up the shaft to his tip. W-was this really so bad?<br />
<br />
Jeff’s cockhead bumped the bottom of his soft belly. His thoughts scattered for a moment before reforming, the waves gently remolding them. He was so big, so hard…who wouldn’t want to be such a big cock? The red light was still there, waves of pleasure still washing through him though his growth had stopped.<br />
<br />
No! I have to hold on, keep my thoughts in place, Jeff thought. Think about happy things, anything other than… being stroked… being licked… hot bears…<br />
<br />
The two accountants resumed kissing even as the light lingered on Jeff. He stood proudly erect, pre dripping down his throbbing shaft. The waves gently played with his thoughts. That feeling of pride was stoked and inflamed. <br />
<br />
Then the other bear turned and got on all fours. Jeff could see that perfect asshole in between his cheeks as the obese man spread them wide. He wanted to be inside it, to feel the walls, the clench of the ring on his shaft. Fucking was what a big cock like him did best.<br />
<br />
His own body knelt behind the bare, taking Jeff in his hands. Then he paused. Jeff twitched and flexed in his grasp as the accountant lubed him and the other accountant up liberally. Jeff wanted to groan, but it all felt so good. He twitched more as the accountant rubbed him up and down. It was harder to think straight. All he could think about was that asshole and the warmth and the tingles-<br />
<br />
The red light switched off as Jeff slid between the accountant’s big cheeks and pressed insistently on his rear entrance. The contact was so delicious he almost came right there. Then the ring relaxed and he glided inside, the walls pressing in close. Jeff felt himself being thrust in and out of the warm, moist hole.<br />
<br />
In and out, in and out. It was almost too much for Jeff to take. And yet he held out, enjoying the friction, the clench of the pucker on his shaft. It was so good, so tight. He thought her heard a cheerful voice somewhere outside, though it was distorted by the accountant’s innards.<br />
<br />
Warmth engulfed his balls and Jeff felt them swell ever-larger. His body bucked its hips, thrusting Jeff deeper and deeper. He was so big now, his balls so achingly full. The warm, gentle light radiated up to this base and Jeff swore he was growing again. His body thrust him nice and deep the waves of warmth pulling him even deeper, spreading the bear’s ring wide.  <br />
<br />
He just wanted to-<br />
<br />
The waves pounded relentlessly on his pysche. All he could think about was the pleasure, how big and perfect he was-<br />
<br />
Wanted to-<br />
<br />
Another wave, flooding his mind, washing away his thoughts. It was a big, proud cock.<br />
<br />
The cock twitched and throbbed as it came, flooding the other accountant’s hole with warmth.</p>
