<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">when you say yes he goes and comes back still naked but with two weird backpacks in his hands. he explains that they are special backpacks they stretch when you shift so you can go fox form and have all your cloths in your backpack. he said strip. you getting angry becuase you just put your cloths on, then your realize something has changed in your... your body must be taking in some estrogen and your turn into a girl... or at least thinking like one. your strip and put your clothes in the back pack as he instructed you on how to strap in around your waste to so it doesn't come off.<br />
<br />
about 2 hours later you finally figure out how to turn fox with some help from the were-fox who told you his name is Jason and that he is 200 years old.... apparently being a were-fox gives you longer life.  he didn't look a day over 21. but he told you to follow him you were surprised at how much stamina you had and how fast you were going. <br />
<br />
we reached the doctors about 2 hours later. we got there around dark and since the doctor lived at the office he was always there. and his office was close to the woods only about 10 feet away.. he also had a doggy door installed just for were-foxes there was a lock on the outside  so other animals couldn't get in but were-foxes were smart enough to open it also the fact that it opened according to a collar on his neck....<br />
<br />
when we go in we turn back to human and got dressed... we rang the bell he had just for were-foxes... he told his patients its for emergency cases. you met him 30 minuets latter after you had ate almost everything in his fridge. apparently if you are turned into a were-fox you have a super increased metabolism and that with the new muscles formed means i need lots of food... you ate mostly the rare meat... at first it disgusted you till you had 3 steaks that way.<br />
<br />
Jason asked him to check you out and when i was in the exam-room striping, your sheath was now all the way up, the doctor came in as Jason was finishing up the story of why we were here. the doctor just said hmmmmmmm.<br />
<br />
at first he tried to get you excited ,your penis was 3 inches flaccid while your sheath was just a little bit longer than that, so in order to checkout your penis  he had to get you excited or pull your sheath down.. and in most cases that won't work without cutting. he stuck a finger in the sheath and pull it out a little and when it didn't strain he pull a bit farther... he kept pulling as both his and Jason's jaw dropped when it stretched all the why to 16 inches. before it wouldn't stretch any more. he got a set of tools he uses for female patients to hold open there vagina to take a look inside and used it to hold your sheath open. he then pull the sheath down an started to look at your cock.  he started to feel up and down looking at the spines that stayed there.. they were smaller almost flat really. and then felt around the bottom of your penis... when you started to get excited from the constant touching down there you wasn't nearly as disgusted as you should have been, but you guess that was due to the female hormones. as it reached 7 inches long  the knot on base base was becoming more and more visible and the spines started to expand out. they were alot bigger than you thought they would be almost 1/2 an inch long each. and that knot made your cock go from 2 inch width to 3 1/2 inches at the bottom.  after he examined you some more in other places and toke out the tool in your sheath he took you to a large xray machine and toke some xrayes of every part of your body in were-fox form fox and human to make sure everything check out, he also took some CT scans MRI pictures and then after studying some of the pictures he told you he needed a sperm sample, you tried to object telling him I'm not sure if they work anymore and he told you you still have a prostate so you will get something. you went to the bathroom he pointed you too, stuck your hand in your sheath, and started to jack off happy that you still could as it started to get bigger and you stopped for a second and stuck the special condom he gave you on it had a glass container on top to hold the sperm then you went back to it and finally you came and cum filler the container and some came around the condom and your dick. but as you came you felt the new muscles inside you tighten up, almost like it was trying to keep your sperm out. you took the sperm back to him..<br />
<br />
he examined it under a microscope and told you i am at least fertile as a male becuase you had a high sperm count then he said he would like to look at something so he set you back on the table and told you to spread your legs you did so he stuck the device in your sheath again and then tried to see if he could get into your penis he tried pushing with his finger, prodding with a blunt pencil and even using a probe used to enter females but he couldn't get in. finally he told you to try, so you just stuck your finger there  and started to twirl it around the  tip opened up a little  then you stuck your finger in the tip  and started to move it down the length of the penis the doctor started to take notes at how stretchy it was. Then precum started to come out to lubricate the inner part of the penis or the outer depending on whether  it would be female or male sex. Your penis quickly hardened except the muscles made sure the inside was open for sex then the doctor said good… and then stuck his finger in too and you started to wither in pleasure as the 2 fingers in your penis made you go crazy he said to start stretching it open and when it was about an inch wide he stuck the tool that was holding your sheath open but a much smaller one and started to open up your penis which hurt a little when it reached 5 inches open because that’s was about its breaking point. The doctor stretched it open to 7 inches thou. Then he took a small probe with a light and camera on the end and started to stick it in and went all the way to the base you could see it and looked around he could feel the muscles in the penis trying to pull the camera down farther. He left it there for a moment as you started to get less excited. The penis softened and the doctor pointed to the monitor and we watched as a small flap of skin flapped across a gap and a large hole disappeared as a small hole opened the doctor wrote down some stuff and then started to move the camera back and forth making your penis hard again and the flap started to slowly but surely flapping back the doctor went to the big hole and went down until he was at the end of his probe and he looked at something and said….. theres your cervix.<br />
<br />
He started to move back and forth with the probe and I felt a pressure  deep within like when I first was transformed and then he watched the cervix open for a short time and took his chance and stuck the probe farther in with his arm in too he looked around and saw the uterus was bi-horned at least but may have been more.  And he looked around and saw that It looked like you are pregnant because he saw a small blemish on the wall near the opening, he said with were-fox’s there are usually 4 or more kittens so theres a good chance that its more than one.  And I should be expecting in around 8 months. But this proves that you are also fertile as a female and he said that from what he can see at the  base of your cock  your tubes split and your have your urethra where your male semen and piss go and then theres a flap of skin like a epiglottis  that  folds over your  vaginal passage when you are stimulated on the outside of your  cock as long as its 1 inch or more from the top and if you are stimulated less than one inch from the top then the flap flips and your vaginal passage opens up, but lets say you get a blow job and she takes the top half and more then it should just be male. I am going to study your sperm and take some blood and tell you in a few days your hormones and DNA and also everything else</p>
