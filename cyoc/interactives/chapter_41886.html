<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad then pumped up the sex appeal to it's maximum level.<br />
<br />
Brad felt a surge in his body. A warmth that made him feel more <br />
confident and a bit self involved.<br />
<br />
As he set off for work he knew he had a few hours before he had to be <br />
in so Brad stopped off at a strip bar and he could feel all eyes on <br />
him.<br />
<br />
One of the best looking strippers with tits the size of watermelons ushered him into a private room and soon it was filled with women <br />
pawing at this hansom man.<br />
<br />
pealing off layer after layer of clothes till he was naked.<br />
<br />
Taking his turn with one after the other he soon was exhausted and <br />
grabbed his clothes, quickly dressed and rushed out of the private <br />
room where he was confronted by the fact that there were no women in <br />
the main bar and dozens of angry men.<br />
<br />
He rushed out the door fearing that he would be pummeled by any <br />
number of these men.<br />
<br />
As he ran down alley and back road he rushed in the back door of an <br />
unidentified business.<br />
<br />
As he stepped through the back hallway into the main room he <br />
discovered that he was in a biker bar. But not just any biker bar but <br />
a gay biker bar. These men looked tough, not something you would <br />
normally associate with a gay bar, and all eyes went to him.<br />
<br />
The two big men standing on opposite sides of the doorway that Brad <br />
entered from grabbed him by his arms and lifted him like a rag doll.<br />
<br />
quickly stripped and fastened into a sling he was immediately <br />
assaulted from both end by many many men.<br />
<br />
his throat and ass were filled for hours with cum and piss. He had no <br />
way to stop the onslaught and resigned himself to the attack. He was <br />
not gay but by the time he was let down, 5 hours later he had grown <br />
to miss the fullness that the men had filled him with.<br />
<br />
Somewhat sated the men dressed him and he went on his way walking <br />
very bow legged. A large wet spot seeding at his back end and a <br />
bloated feeling in his stomach.<br />
<br />
He was already very late for work and as he entered the vets office <br />
he started to open all the doors to let the dogs out for a walk and <br />
rather than heading out the back door they headed toward Brad <br />
mounting him in turn.<br />
<br />
He was exhausted from his day and when the morning came the dr came <br />
in seeing Brad passed out on the floor and a chihuahua comically taking his turn at the waiting boy.<br />
<br />
He was sent on his way where he passed out as soon as he got home <br />
waking to a call from his boss telling him he was no longer needed.<br />
<br />
Brad frantically searched for the chronivac but was unable to find it <br />
anywhere. He needed to change that now. Where could it be? Could he <br />
have lost it somewhere along the way?<br />
<br />
It was almost 3 hours later, getting close to happy hour when he felt <br />
an uncontrollable urge to head to the biker bar.<br />
<br />
Jerry the bartender at the biker bar had found the chronivac and had <br />
been playing with it all day long. Making changes first to Brad and <br />
then to himself.<br />
<br />
Unknown to Brad Jerry had castrated Brad and making mental changes to <br />
him to lusting for men using him in every conceivable way.<br />
<br />
Jerry was going to use this machine to earn himself a good living changing some of the men in the bar into working boys and subservient to him.<br />
<br />
Brad was just a whore. Getting reamed from both ends and his sex <br />
appeal was left at high so he was always in demand.<br />
<br />
Terry the big 500 pound bear was turned into a 110 pound smooth as a <br />
baby's butt chaser. He was collared and sat on the ground next to the <br />
bar and would suck off any man that came up to him depositing a 10 in <br />
the tip jar.<br />
<br />
Donald was one of Jerry's strangest changes. He made him with an <br />
insatiable hunger. This Muscle man would come in sit at a corner <br />
table and eat for the patrons. Anything and everything they brought <br />
him. And wash it down with gallons of beer. His once buff body was <br />
quickly turning into a blubber boy and these men would stuff his face <br />
into a cheesecake while reaming his ass.<br />
<br />
All of Jerry's men were very submissive and would do what he wanted <br />
turning over their earnings to Jerry. And when one became unable to <br />
earn him a good living he would sell them off to one of the customers <br />
and build himself a new money maker.</p>
