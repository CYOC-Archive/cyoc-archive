<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were enjoying your walk in the park when an abomination dared to brush its pestilent form against your arm. This humanoid abortion of nature didn’t had enough just leaving an ugly stain imprinted on your retinas, it had to go and actually touch you.<br />
<br />
To add insult to the repugnant act, the abomination opened his greasy lips and you found out with bewilderment that the big mass of body fat turned out to be capable of human speech.<br />
<br />
“Hey, watch where ya’ goin’, punk!” The obese creature blurted out with jaded breath, the sole act of standing up in place being too much of a workout for the sweaty slob. A crude caricature of an ugly human man that had unwillingly gone through a washing machine for hours until his body features had deformed and stretched to their limits, that’s how it seemed to you. His enormous belly and man boobs were blown up and bouncing around as the owner of these disgusting things turned around to face you. His shirt seemed to be at least three sizes too small exposing his hairy underbelly and his black hole of a navel to everyone.<br />
<br />
You weren’t planning to waste not even a single precious second of your time to the pink dumb troll but just when you were to turn around and leave the mythological monstrosity put his hairy hand on your shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Not even a single word of apology, uh? Don’t ya know who my father is? He’s a big shot around here... Surely you must know the mayor... He’s the one who built this very park you’re standing on!” The male monster with female-sized tits kept spouting nonsense. “Ya better show some respect!”<br />
<br />
“Me? Respect you?” That sure did make you chuckle. “To an airheaded buffoon like you, a big balloon blowed up with undeserved luxuries and treats?” You pointed at his beach ball of a belly to illustrate your point. “Yes, I can tell you’ve never worked up a sweat, in the rhetorical sense of course. You’d make a big service to the poor dirt on the ground your heavy self is standing on if you were to leave the Earth’s surface.”<br />
<br />
“Wha’?!” The dumb man’s brain was having a hard time comprehending your words. It took him awhile to realize you were putting his worth as a human being in question. “Who ya’ callin’ an airhead?” He laughed in naïve mockery. “Don’t make me laugh! You’re the only airhead around here, you fucking punk!”<br />
<br />
“Alright then, let’s make it clear for a simple-minded fool like you. Let’s start by getting rid of some of the luggage leaving you nailed to the ground, like that complete depence you have on everyone that surrounds you. At the snap of my fingers, your entire existence will be completely disbanded from your family and the few young gangsters who you call your friends. They’ll forget completely about you. For the world you’ll never have existed in the first place. You won’t have a family, you won’t have any friends, nobody will remember you at all and you’ll have to win some money in order to survive for a change. You’ll have no home, no belongings... Oh! But just to be an asshole I’ll make sure you pay back to society every single cent you’ve ever spent with your rich dad’s money. Debt is the only thing I can’t erase, it’d mess up the world economy, you know?”<br />
The fat man was confused. “The fuck does that even mean? What kind of trick are you trying to pull...?”<br />
<br />
SNAP!<br />
<br />
“That should do it.” You said, completely unfazed. Overwriting a dumb man’s existence was something you could do without batting an eye. And you were just getting started.<br />
<br />
The fatso’s eyes darted around in confusion, oblivious to what had just happened. “You’re a big weirdo! I’m callin’ the cops!” The fatso tried to take out something from his pocket, probably his phone, but he didn’t find it. “What the?! Where is it?! Did ya fucking stole it from me, punk?”<br />
<br />
“Phones are too expensive for a bum like you to afford them. And you have nobody to call to any longer in any case. You have no identity or past.”<br />
<br />
“You stole my ID card too?!” The fat man said, completely misunderstanding your words. He pulled out his wallet. To his horror, his wallet was completely empty. The photo of his family had evaporated in the blink of an eye, and so was his ID card and any personal documents. “Hey, you stole the twenty bucks I was stashing in there!”<br />
<br />
You laughed out loud. From all the things you had taken away from him, he was only moved by the hit on his greed. These dumb fucks were all selfish animals.<br />
<br />
“You fucking thief! Give me my money back!” The fat man got ready to launch himself at you. You didn’t like that, not a tiny bit. You considered yourself a pacifist. Violence was the most unnecessary thing in this world...<br />
<br />
...That’s why you prefered crushing people’s souls and their own will to live instead. It was the most befitting punishment and besides, it was something you enjoyed.<br />
<br />
And so, half a second before the fat man could hit you, you snapped your fingers again. The man’s body froze in mid-motion. He could only move his head. You grinned as you watched him struggle, the chubby man still completely unaware of his fate. <br />
<br />
“More tricks? What have ya done this time, punk?!” He asked, still angry as hell.<br />
<br />
Your smile grew wider. “Me? Oh, I’m just showing you who’s the airhead here.”<br />
<br />
“What...? Blurgh!” The fat man said and just then his lips felt rubbery and squishy. He tried very hard to articulate some expletives but his mouth was in the process of being sealed off forever. “Blurggh! I’ll tell my dad about this, you blurgh...! Blurghhh...! ...!”<br />
<br />
“Ah, that’s much better. I couldn’t bear your senseless whining for much longer.”<br />
<br />
The paralyzed and mute chubby man looked back at you. He couldn’t hide how scared he was, but his eyes glanced at you menacingly nonetheless. It was deliciously ironic how he tried to put on a brave facade when his ugly face was about to be taken away from him.<br />
<br />
His mouth was gone. There were looks of questions going through the fatso’s head. How was he going to eat his favorite burgers with BBQ sauce now, for example. But you still had much more work to do.<br />
<br />
The eyes of the paralyzed mouthless wonder went wide. He could feel very deeply how another one of his holes had begun to seal off. However this hole wasn’t placed on his head. It was placed somewhere intimate where the sun never shone.<br />
<br />
“Don’t look at me that way. I’m just doing nature a big favor by isolating some of the most toxic gas on the world.”<br />
<br />
The fatso’s eyes were beginning to water and his nostrils were sobbing very loudly. His anus was being filled up by his own body fat, rapidly and in an repetitive motion until no air could come in or out. For the virgin man it felt like his rectum was being pierced by a big and hard dildo made of greasy foods. Anally raped by his own deadly sin of sloth... How twistedly poetic.<br />
<br />
Once the fat buttocks were closed up shop for eternity it was time to get rid of his human skin. His pale pink body turned red and rubbery, moles and birthmarks including his giant belly button were dissolving and all of his hair fell off. From his head, his hairy arms and legs, his pubes, his back and buttcrack, his big bulging belly... He was shaved from head to toe.<br />
<br />
His clothes got filled with loose hairs all over. The fat man had never wore clothes that befitted his abundant girth in the first place but between the rigid pose he had gotten stuck on mid-punch and the changes his body were undergoing his pants and underwear were slowly but surely sliding off his waist, much to the dismay of the man without an anus between his meaty buttcheeks anymore.<br />
<br />
The chubby man had been turned into a red shiny rendition of himself that felt rubbery to the touch. He was frozen and posing like a statue... A statue with a breathing nose and moving eyes, although not for much longer.<br />
<br />
The red rubber texture that his skin had transformed into extended towards his ears, his nose, and finally his panicking eyes. You however used your power to bestow him the privilege of retaining all of his senses. He wouldn’t get the punishment he deserved if he became unconscious, after all.<br />
<br />
Now, that was more like it. If he looked like a statue moments before, now he looked like a special sizes clothing store mannequin with his completely featureless head and the clothes still clinging on him.<br />
<br />
His fingers receded into his palms until his hands became useless stubs. His toes and feet followed a similar pattern until there was nothing filling his shoes. The four stubs belonging to the red rubbery featureless mass shrunk rapidly into his torso, the heavy thing landing on top of its pile of former clothing.<br />
<br />
Now that he was just a faceless head on a very chubby and round torso the grand finale was approaching. You did the honors of pushing his head into the rest of his body with your shoe. It wasn’t unlike stomping on a big pile of red putty until it became a shapeless mess. You kept stepping on it until the internal organs of the big ball of clay were blended into thin air.<br />
<br />
You admired your craftwork. A big ball of red rubber filled with air. Now THAT was a real airhead. You stared at the inanimate object. The inanimate object didn’t stare back, but it was aware of all of its surroundings thanks to the “gift” you had given it.<br />
<br />
“So, Airhead, how does it feel to be filled with so much hot air?”<br />
The airhead didn’t answer back.<br />
“Because you see, I’m not doing this just for my own entertainment, I was actually thinking about offering you a job to liquidate your debt. How about working as the park balloon? For every hour that someone spends holding you I’ll deduce a certain amount from the money you owe to your father and the rest of society. Sounds like a deal?”<br />
The airhead had absolutely no means to reply back. <br />
<br />
You looked at the big heavy ball of rubber on the ground with delight.<br />
“I still think you need to lose some weight... You’re too heavy to float! Let’s fix that, shall we?”<br />
You snapped your fingers one more time. The airhead stood still, feeling powerless and naked about what you still had in store for him. A faint hissing sound could be heard, and the balloon noticed it was coming from his insides.<br />
<br />
The balloon needed to be lighter, and the quickest way to do that was by expulsating the excess weight by the only hole that remained on his body: the one at the tip of his still fairly human-looking penis.<br />
<br />
The dumb airhead wanted to scream. The little wrinkled appendage that hung from the red rubber ball was wide open, letting go of its hot air. To the inanimate object it felt like someone was forcing out the body fat outta it through its genitals... But was the air coming out just body fat or the dissolved remains of his internal organs and bones? Hard to tell by now.<br />
<br />
The deflation process was accelerating by the second. The airhead tried very hard to resist but his cock and balls were letting it all out in desperation. What would happen if the balloon lost all of his air accidentally? Would it live on as a deflated piece of rubber? Would it die? Now, wouldn’t it be interesting to find out?<br />
<br />
But before that could happen you yanked the deflating balloon by what used to be its manhood and tied the red piece of rubber up with an expert knot. Maybe the knot had been tied too tightly and the airhead was currently silently suffering in pain. Hopefully.<br />
<br />
You materialized a piece of string and placed it on the tip of the balloon’s cock. You grabbed the other end of the string and tugged at it. The embarrassed red balloon floated in the air in silence.<br />
<br />
“You make the perfect balloon, Airhead! You’re going to be a valuable working asset for the first time in your life! Don’t you feel pure happiness?”<br />
<br />
The airhead could only feel pain and humiliation.<br />
<br />
You found a fence nearby, it’ll be the ideal workplace for Airhead. It had been placed in order to separate the main road of the park from some extremely sharp and pointy bushes but some laboral risks will help Airhead stay alert and not slack off on the job.<br />
<br />
After tying Airhead’s string to the fence, you created a wooden sign out of thin air right next to it detailing the services it offered.<br />
<br />
“Lighten up that face, it’s your first day of work! Now Airhead, make sure to always tend your customers with a big smile! And remember, you owe hundreds of thousands of dollars to society, so you’ll be working for me for a long time. Try not to get yourself ripped to shreds in the process!” You laughed at the balloon’s predicament and, after twisting its tight ribbon of a knot one last time as a farewell, you resumed your walk.<br />
<br />
After powerlessly observing how the only person who knew what its rubber self really was walked away into the distance, the balloon was able to catch a quick glimpse of the sign that had been erected right next to itself.<br />
<br />
“Rent-A-Balloon. 0.01$/hour.”<br />
<br />
...Looks like a certain airhead would be stuck in here for a long time.</p>
