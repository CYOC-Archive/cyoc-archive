<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s dad&#39;s half brother was staying with them for a week.  He was a terribly hairy man.  He was also only a about ten years older than Jeff, and nearly 15 years younger than Jeff&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
Jeff had been fascinated with just how hairy Sebastian was.  He wondered what it would feel like to have all that body hair. To touch that muscular virile 28 year old body.  He could be that body hair.  He clicked on the boxes on the Chronivac control screen and hit enter.<br />
<br />
Sebastian and Jerome (Jeff&#39;s dad) were talking in the basement watching TV and drinking beers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should do it, Sebastian,&quot; Jerome said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think, I&#39;ll do better with women?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do worse, Seb.  Besides, I&#39;m not saying to wax all over, but to manscape yourself.  The beach is a great place to show off your muscled body, but when you put on that swimsuit, you look like a bear stuffed in a Speedo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I dunno, Jerry?  It&#39;s gonna hurt,&quot; Sebastian said.<br />
<br />
Jerome continued, &quot;Listen you&#39;re the one who signed up for the Muscle Beach Competition.  You have the muscles under all that fur, but if you&#39;re going to win, you have to wear a Speedo, and lose most of that fur.  Waxing hurts, but it&#39;s not permanent like electrolysis.  It will grow back - unless you use depilatory.  And if you use depilatory on your back, ass and abs, you&#39;ll look a lot better when the fur grows back.  No more Sasquatch jokes.  Now I&#39;ll go with you to the salon early tomorrow.  So you better get to bed, little bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Night, Jer- and thank.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sebastian plodded upstairs to the get room.  He felt an odd tingling as he walked up the carpeted stairs.  Must be static electricity, he thought.  <br />
<br />
Jeff felt so weird.   One moment he seemed to be falling backwards through his desk chair and through space, and then he was in a million pieces.  He was still himself but he felt himself replacing every hair from follicle to tip on his uncle&#39;s body.  The pubic hairs were wild.  He felt himself spinning and growing longer, as he became long kinky black hairs.  Even the other body hair was well-over a half inch long, and a lot was a couple inches long.  It was why Uncle Seb looked so hairy- not really the number of hair, just it&#39;s length.  His own father and Jeff too had tiny body hairs, and since they were both blond, the hairs they had were almost imperceptible on their skin.  They weren&#39;t hairless, but they looked smooth except up close.  Seb was hirsute.<br />
<br />
Sebastian stripped down in front of the guest room full-length mirror and examined his body.  He did look like Sasquatch.  He was so big and hairy.  He looked at the muscle mag on his suitcase.  He knew under his fur he looked like those guys.  He would win the competition later this week.  He ran his hands over his furry body.<br />
<br />
It felt so sensual to Jeff.  He was sort of embarrassed, Seb was his uncle.  But Seb didn&#39;t know, and technically, Jeff was just body hair now. He had set duration for a week, so he could be with his uncle during the competition.  He so wanted to see the hairy muscled dude beat those hairless muscle freaks like Al- his former bully who was also competing.<br />
<br />
As Sebastian looked at the magazine, he started to get hard.  He locked the door, and climbed into bed.  He jacked off to the fold-out of last year&#39;s Muscle Beach Competition.  He might do better with girls with less hair, but he hoped it work for guys too.  He blew his load, and it splattered all over his hairy abs, chest and crotch.  Seb fell asleep.  Jeff was aware and awake, as the cum caked and dried, and Uncle Sebastian began to snore. <br />
<br />
The alarm awoke him at 6 am.  Seb got up and headed straight for the shower.  He turned it on, and grabbed the bodywash.  Then he climbed in the shower, felt the hot water plastering his body hairs to his body.  He lathered up.  He soaped everywhere, rinsed everywhere, and it took forever to dry the water trapped by his body hair after the shower.  He even blasted himself with the blow dryer.<br />
<br />
He dressed in loose minimal clothing, and headed down to breakfast.<br />
<br />
Jeff was nervous.  Would the reality altering abilities of the Chronivac really work so that Jeff wouldn&#39;t be missed?<br />
<br />
Seb, Jer, and Rita sat down to breakfast with big brother Jerry who was home from college for the weekend.  Jeff&#39;s seat was empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope Jeff&#39;s having fun,&quot; Jerry said glancing at the empty seat, &quot;I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s not here for Seb&#39;s contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, your brother had this planned for months, and he paid for it, so he could hardly postpone it just to see Seb compete in a bodybuilding contest.  Besides, I plan to video it.  You want to help.  You&#39;re the film student after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be cool.  A behind the scenes documentary.  Would that be okay, Uncle Seb?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Jerry, you can even come with me to get waxed today.&quot;<br />
<br />
WAXED? Jeff tried to remember what the Chronivac said about changes while transformed.  There was something about risks, but he hadn&#39;t read that carefully.  The hair on Seb&#39;s neck rose, and he ran his hand over them.  Well, Jeff would grow back eventually....<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting waxed?  Cool!  Hey, are you going to stay waxed or let the hair grow back afterward?  Are you going to have everything but your eyebrows removed like Al did?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still hanging out with Al?&quot; Jerome said with concern.  He knew that Jerry&#39;s buddy was a bad influence and had bullied Jeff when they were younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, but I see him.  And he looks really different bald.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know that Seb needs to manscape that much,&quot; Jerome said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I haven&#39;t decided.  I&#39;ll see how it goes, and may have them take off some more. Or not?&quot;  he shrugged and picked at his food.  He hoped this was the right decision.<br />
<br />
Jerry wondered to himself how much all that body hair would weigh.  He would bring a bag with them to collect Uncle Seb&#39;s hair, and weigh it for the documentary.<br />
<br />
Jeff screamed no.  But nobody can hear body hair scream.</p>
