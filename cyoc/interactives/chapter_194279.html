<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam took a few minutes to find what he wanted. The app wasn´t that easy to navigate, but there was a folder with pre-set settings for the teddies, as well as other plush animals. “It´s good that the app has pre-prepared settings, only why do they hide them from the user? Maybe I should just have read the manual for that, but now let´s find the right ones for you, teddy.” But Sam quickly had a problem to fix. “Why is your memory so full? I can´t copy the right files in, dammit.”<br />
Theo was in shock. Would that man simply override him, deleting him away? He wasn´t able to stop him in any way. “Please, don´t kill my memory.” “****, I can´t even say what I want to stop him.” Theo mentally cursed, not that that worked out as he wanted, either.<br />
Sam ignored Theo´s answer, trying to find a way around the full memory. “I don´t want to risk deleting anything, even if that much data is weird. That looks like someone has copied a full human set of memories inside this teddy. Maybe they wanted to try if he acts more alive that way. Whatever, I don´t think we need that much data. Let´s see, if I don´t want to override or delete the data, so I can only compress it as much as needed.”<br />
Before Theo could say anything to stop Sam, he had started the process to compress the memories file. Theo felt his body shut down, stiff as a statue, still looking up at Sam, eyes frozen. Pressure was quickly building inside his head. To Theo it felt as if his brain was squished flat between heavy plates. Then a second set pressed inside from the sides, it felt as if his brain was now more pole shaped. A final set then pressed the pole down into a perfect cube, leaving it about a tenth of its original size.<br />
Theo screamed the whole time in pain, just limited to inside his mind. Along the compressing, everything got mixed up to him. What was data worth 18 years of  memories ended up as data worth of only 1,8 years. Memories of the time he was five, squished together with newer ones. Had the accident with the car been when he was five? But why would he have driven a car at five-years-old? He couldn´t grip what belonged together and what not anymore.<br />
Sam, not knowing what he was doing to Theo, thinking of him as a simple teddy bear with to much data inside his memory, again tried to install the pre-set programming into the bear, but even with the memories inside reduced to a tenth of their former size, it was still to much data left. “Damn” Sam cursed in frustration. “I will need to compress it even more. I hope its not damaged if anyone needs to decompress it later.”<br />
While Theo´s memories had been compressed, his senses were still fully intact. And if he had been able to, he would have screamed in absolute horror when he heard Sam say that they needed to be more compressed. But he could do nothing when then pain and pressure returned, even stronger squishing his metaphorical cube sized brain smaller, again to a tenth of its actual size, a hundredth of its original space. It left Theo nearly memory-less, as whatever was left of his memories was compressed so much he couldn´t unfurl anything right from it. Now the 18 years were compressed into a bit more than two months, leaving nearly nothing to work with for Theo.<br />
Sam realized soon that the pre-set programming was still a bit to big. “What have they done, built in a memory chip a size to small? *sigh* Third time its a charm I guess.”<br />
Theo couldn´t even scream at the mental pain, as his memories were already to insignificant sized to notice it being compressed yet again. And as it left that compressing process as a thousandth of what it originally was, Theo couldn´t use it anymore in any way. It wasn´t even a week left from the 18 years worth of memories. Also, unbeknownst to Theo, his emotions were compressed alongside his memories, leaving him with nothing but cold programming.<br />
Only his very basic programming, which his father had installed into him, was still completely functional. His vocabulary was also still intact, but it was now more like a lexicon entry for each word, nothing connected to single words other than basic meanings. He only knew he was called Theo from the pre-set data, but everything else was locked away to him. He was just a teddy right now.<br />
Sam was satisfied when he finally could install the pre-set programming into Theo, which flooded Theo´s memory like an tsunami, the nano-sized cube that was his compressed memories flushed into the last corner, making even remembering that it was there impossible to the poor teddy called Theo.<br />
Sam had decided on a happy, playful and submissive setting, something completely other than Theo was in character. While the pre-set programming was installed, Sam used Theo to jack off, using him as a masturbation aid. Even for a robot the bear was incredible soft, so Sam enjoyed the experience. It was also a reward to Sam in a way, he had been patient enough for it all to work out.<br />
While Theo the teddy was aware of Sam´s doing, he had no idea if it was a right or a wrong usage of his body. He couldn´t feel pain, and didn´t remember what exactly Sam was doing with him, as without his memories this all was new to him. And even if he would be able to tell, with the installing process running, he was still unable to speak or move in any way on his own.<br />
Sam shot his load just as the installing finished, leaving the teddies snout covered in cum. Something Theo hadn´t known before, and if he had he wouldn´t remember it now, was that his plush body was rather absorbent, and within seconds there was no trace of the cum left on his snout, not even dry marks. He had tasted it, but without any reference material Theo couldn´t say if the substance was tasty or disgusting, not that it would say anything for the teddy.<br />
Sam looked surprised at the clean bear, and after smelling it, decided he wouldn´t need to clean it, as it smelled fresh and new. So, he cleaned only himself in the bathroom before returning the teddy to the room with the sleeping kids.<br />
Sam continued to scan the app for additional editing, finding the still intact vocabulary the teddy could use theoretically. There were way to much swear words, insults and such terms not fitting a teddy in any way. “Who would put such foul language into a child´s toy, even if most of it is blocked from use?” Sam mumbled for only himself and Theo to hear.<br />
Using the option to look at all blocked words he quickly found them all not accurate for a child´s toy, and with a shrug compressed them as well. He wouldn´t delete them, maybe there was a reason he didn´t know. It didn´t clear much space, but that hadn´t been his goal in compressing them. With another function of the app, he could hide things from the teddy, and so set the compressed foul language data hidden to Theo.<br />
To Theo himself it was a bit painful again. He gained a headache from the forceful compressing. It was only because of its still normal size that he could feel it, and it was far lighter pain than before with his memories. As the pain dulled away, a sudden chill went through Theo´s mind and suddenly he couldn´t remember that the just compressed data even existed in his mind. He had no way of using it anymore, as he didn´t remember anything about it. Why exactly had he felt pain just seconds ago?<br />
Half an hour later Theo the teddy was happily playing with the kids as they woke up, and everyone loved their new friend, hoping he would stay with them. Sam watched the children satisfied, not knowing what he had done to the human trapped inside the toy. But he already wished to use the bear again some time as a masturbation aid. Hopefully the teddy would stay with them longer. And as Theo had no memories of being human from his compressed files, he was happy playing with the kids, not thinking about the next days.</p>
