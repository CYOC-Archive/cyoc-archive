<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alan had a fairly average day, that is, if you ignored the fact that he was the wrong age and gender. After catching up with the soap opera, he figured he should do some chores. He was the house wife after all. He pulled out the vacuum and started to clean the house. He went around each nook and cranny. He was a little bored, but he figured vacuuming was better than going to chemistry class.<br />
<br />
As he cleaned, he eventually found a photo of the family on vacation to some amusement park. Alan, or &quot;Alana&quot; in this case, was holding hands with a middle aged man Alan had never seen before. &quot;Oh right, I guess I have a husband now.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;I guess he&#39;s traveling for work right now.&quot; He guessed. Also in the photo was his &quot;daughter&quot; Stephanie. She was there with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Jake, and Jake was standing next to the final member of the family, Megan.<br />
<br />
Alan and Janet forgot to tell Steve, but Megan had also requested a change before &quot;Jake&quot; and &quot;Steph&quot; left. She asked them to make her 17 so she could go to high school for a day. Janet happily agreed and this morning Megan had happily driven to school in a car that &quot;daddy&quot; had bought her.<br />
<br />
Megan had had a pretty substantial day. Since reality had changed so that she was born earlier, she had a completely new set of friends. They were all pretty cool and Megan had a fun time with them all. She got hit on by some cute older guys, she went to harder classes which she somehow enjoyed, and she even laughed as she found a former year book with her father as Stephanie in it.<br />
<br />
Janet and Steve also had a pretty great day. After their shower, the two acted as horny teenagers would and began to fuck all day long. At first, Steve was a little embarrassed by it, but his new hormones quickly took over and he loved every second of being dominated by &quot;Jake&#39;s&quot; massive cock. Eventually they calmed down enough to cuddle and watch a romantic movie. Janet had put it on, but found she didn&#39;t enjoy the movie as much as she usually did. Steve, meanwhile, loved it while he wondered why he never saw it in that light before.<br />
<br />
The day slowly came to a close and Alan decided he definitely didn&#39;t want to cook after cleaning the whole house, so he ordered two pizzas and called it a day. Just as he sat down to chill at the kitchen table, the older Megan walked in through the door with a smile on her face and a spring in her step.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, someone had a fun day.&quot; Alan joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alan it. Was. Awesome.&quot; She cheerily replied. &quot;God, high school is so much fun!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It really isn&#39;t.&quot; Alan disagreed. &quot;Now Middle school was a lot of fun. Recess was still a thing, everyone was an idiot but nobody cared, oh it was great. In high school everybody puts you into cliches and judges you and stuff. You just had a fun time because you also changed your life with your magic to make you popular.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we clearly had reverse experiences.&quot; Megan said blatantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Alan perked up with a smirk. &quot;How about a little role reversal? He asked. &quot;We&#39;ll ask Mom and Dad to make me into a middle school girl, and you into a high school boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay yeah, sounds fun. SO it&#39;s a bet then? I&#39;ll prove you&#39;re being dramatic about being a high school boy-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll prove that YOU&#39;RE the one who&#39;s being dramatic about being a middle school girl. Only real rule is that we can&#39;t use our magic to cheat.&quot; Alan interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; Megan laughed as the two shook hands. &quot;But wait, what&#39;s the rewards and punishments?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, we&#39;ll figure that out later.&quot; Alan waved it off as he thought about how easy it would be to prove her wrong.<br />
<br />
As they finished making their bet, Steve and Janet finally arrived back downstairs. Steve was wearing pink, fuzzy, hello kitty pajamas with a purple sweatshirt and no bra, while Janet was only wearing boxers and a t-shirt. Steve&#39;s hair was tied up in a messy ponytail while Janets was completely messed up. Both of them were snickering.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two look like you had fun.&quot; Alan chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh definitely.&quot; Steve agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, being young again really spiced things up between us.&quot; Janet laughed. &quot;That and having this beast.&quot; Janet pointed down laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, gross Mom.&quot; Megan gagged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry Megan, I guess my mind&#39;s a little manlier than usual.&quot; Janet apologized. &quot;But I can fix that.&quot; She said as she selected her bracelet, which in her guy form had changed to match her identity by becoming an apple watch. Janet&#39;s height immediately decreased while her minimal facial hair vanished. Her thicker figure returned as her breasts came back and her hair shot past her shoulders. Her clothes turned into her standard pajamas and she happily sighed. &quot;Much better.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you&#39;re back, then I&#39;ll turn back to.&quot; Steve laughed as he selected the reverse change. His gut returned as his hair vanished and his clothes became boxes and a shitty looking shirt. Megan and Alan were happy to see their parent&#39;s faces again, but Janet and Steve were having other thoughts. They were both smiling at one another, but both felt off. <br />
<br />
They both still found the other attractive, but after being young and fit again, the two were both feeling a little bad about being with the other again. They both pretended like they didn&#39;t feel anything as the doorbell rung. Megan walked to the door and took the pizza before coming back with the pies. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the weirdest thing,&quot; Megan said. &quot;I offered him money but he said it was the &#39;random lucky delivery of the year&#39; or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s my doing.&quot; Alan laughed as he held up the book. &quot;I made it so that my ordering of the pizza would be free, and reality adjusted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice work son!&quot; Steve laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dad.&quot; Said Alan in his 40 year old woman&#39;s body. The whole family caught Alan&#39;s feminine tone while responding and everybody laughed. Janet and Steve turned their kids back and everybody began to chow down. While they ate, everybody chatted about their day, Alan and Megan told their parents about their bet, Steve told everyone his crazy waking up story, and the whole family had a great meal. They all hung out for a bit longer, and then everybody went to bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight kids!&quot; Janet yelled. &quot;Remember, once you come downstairs I&#39;ll change you both and the bet will begin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it Mom!&quot; They both called back as they entered their respective rooms.<br />
<br />
Everybody went to sleep, mostly eager about the next day.</p>
