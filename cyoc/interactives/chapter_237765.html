<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy was promptly handed a towel - the better to make sure he didn&#39;t get too sweaty in there - and he was left alone to go in there. Tommy for his part, because he had so vanishingly little experience with saunas, promptly stepped up and opened the door - gasping in surprise as he was met with a wall of hot air. He coughed out loud as he felt the heat waft over his face first due to him leading with it, and then cascading over the rest of him. He bit his lip and figured this was normal. This must be what a sauna was. He remembered his dad liked saunas a lot...<br />
<br />
And if dad liked saunas like this, well, Tommy figured that he should give it a chance. The heat must just be something that helps you calm down and relax somehow. So he just gulped, and stepped inside, swinging the door awkwardly shut behind him. The heat if anything was even more intense now - as submerged in it as Tommy was. It washed over him like a current, the steam swirling and cradling his form like his mother as distant as she was as of now.<br />
<br />
Tommy took a seat, and the boy moaned as he felt the heat surging up - it felt like the steam was just building up so much in here. &quot;Man...why&#39;s it gotta be so hot...?&quot; And by now, with his inexperience in mind, it wasn&#39;t much of a surprise that Tommy began to sweat quite a bit. He saw his jersey starting to cling to his chest, and wet spots were starting to show on the legs of his shorts. &quot;Mm...man I kinda feel funny...&quot; He hoped it wasn&#39;t the heat getting to him.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t wanna look like a wimp going in here when his dad could handle going in the sauna. Tommy began to pull at his jersey, trying to get his skin some air. He didn&#39;t notice his body, sitting there on the bench, beginning to stretch taller. He just assumed that the growing tightness in his jersey was caused by the sweat pouring off of his skin and sinking into the substance of his clothes. But as he sat there, feeling increasingly odd in the vascillating depths of the steam, Tommy grunted, &quot;Man...all this heat makes me feel funny...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never really felt like this before. Not even during the summer...&quot; Indeed, as Tommy progressed along to age 11, his body was starting to interact with his hormones and development in a way he was deeply unfamiliar with. His stomach was starting to leap, feeling awkward and unsettled. The boy grit his teeth and clenched the sides of the bench. His hands were beginning to grow larger as he did so, his frame beginning to move from boyish and small, chubby and rife with baby fat to a more lanky form.<br />
<br />
Lanky, but there were some hints as to what was to come. Tommy was an athletic boy, after all. He loved running around and tossing the football - and this began to be reflected in his form. He breathed, and tried to convince himself first and foremost, &quot;Man...this feels...SOOOOrta good...&quot; He then coughed again, wondering why his voice was starting to crack. His hair began to grow out a bit, getting a bit more of a wavy look to it.<br />
<br />
But as Tommy sat there, not even knowing that he was growing from 11 to 12, there began to be other effects to his slow progression to adolescence. He sighed, still tugging on his jersey and shorts - they were getting really tight and really uncomfortable. He swore his sweat was just soaking em both. Tommy found himself looking down at his chest, which was starting to look more athletic, and the way his shoulders felt so tight against his sleeves.<br />
<br />
Not exactly a young Hercules, but he was reaping the benefits of athleticism. Not to mention the way he was thinking. Tommy found himself comparing the way he was feeling in these soaked clothes to the way he saw his teacher Miss Bruner that one time. She was drenched in rainwater when she came into class that day. And for some reason, Tommy found himself thinking about that in more detail. He could remember so much about that day.<br />
<br />
He remembered the chill of the wind, the rain biting against his skin, such an utter contrast to the heat he currently surrounded himself with. And Tommy could remember Miss Bruner, sitting there in the classroom. Her clothes were just absolutely soaked. And her boobies were really showing in her shirt. He could even remember seeing some nipple.<br />
<br />
Tommy blushed, wondering where that memory came from all of a sudden - but it was regardless the reason a very pleasant one. &quot;Mmm...Miss Bruner...&quot; He found himself shifting a bit as he sat there, still a bit taller, a bit more gangly, but there was starting to be a noticeable shift in the way Tommy&#39;s body was structured. Those broad shoulders started to press out a bit more. They were thin at the front and back, but there was a telling width. The tell of an emergent sportsman.<br />
<br />
Why, Tommy found himself pondering, was that thing between his legs so hard? It wasn&#39;t very big, not yet at least, but sheesh it was really hard. It didn&#39;t help when Tommy found himself thinking about that day again. Remembering seeing Miss Bruner&#39;s son Timothy show up at the end of the day. He apparently needed to deliver her something. And he was just as soaked as she was, having ran there in the rain and the storm.<br />
<br />
And Timothy wasn&#39;t exactly a hunk, per se, but to a young and inexperienced Tommy, Timothy might as well have been. He remembered seeing the older boy&#39;s tight, muscular pecs against his shirt, and the trim, toned midsection - not yet abs, but it was almost there. The obliques were pretty sweet too. Gosh, Timothy Bruner had a nice pair of pecs...<br />
<br />
Tommy had never noticed boys and girls in the way he was now. In a way that spoke to something changing about him on a fundamental level. A suffusion through him of a certain sex hormone and its effect on his perception. And if anything as he started to crest 12 going on 13, some things became clearer about the path he was taking. He found himself awkwardly tugging again at his sleeves, his whole jersey feeling so tight on him, so slick with sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh man, I feel so weird...&quot; He then let out several harsh breaths and began the process of yanking off his jersey. He probably should&#39;ve just taken it off before he went in - but again, Tommy hadn&#39;t exactly had a wealth of experience with the subject. As Tommy began pulling and yanking, managing to get the accursedly tight thing over his head, his wildly thrashing, flexing form began to show the results of his first workouts.<br />
<br />
True, actual exercise began to filter into the form and function of Tommy Rockman&#39;s body. His pecs began to grow broader, his midsection&#39;s tone began to improve, his little biceps and triceps began to grow distinct. His legs tensed and he stomped his feet, his quads beginning to show as distinct from the rest. His thighs likewise began to show some hints of development.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh shiiiit...shit shit shit...&quot; He didn&#39;t even care those were words his mom would&#39;ve castigated him severely for using, he was feeling so uncomfortable with these clothes! Eventually, Tommy fully pulled the jersey off - showing skin that grew a bit more tan from constantly running around out there under the sun. His face which emerged from the cocoon of the jersey was thinner, a bit more angular - developing from a young boy into a teen.<br />
<br />
And a teen that his fellow adolescents might very well describe as &quot;handsome&quot;. He awkwardly grinned as he sat there, the feeling of strength in his body was only matched by his increasing sensation of odd dizziness. Tommy looked down at his shorts, increasingly tight against his groin and his butt, and he blushed - seeing just how big that bulge was. Yes, Tommy was certainly blessed going into his teenage years. Blessed indeed.<br />
<br />
Even as he began to feel dizzy and a little light-headed due to the steam, Tommy started to feel just as much curious. <br />
<br />
The youth pulled his shorts and increasingly torn underwear down - and out popped an erection that kinda scared him briefly when it just came out like that. His boy-thing was HARD. And it was pretty big. It was bobbing around, and it looked kinda like... He bit his lip slightly and wrapped a hand around it on a hunch...<br />
<br />
...And Tommy gasped as he felt the sheer sensitivity. In that moment, as he began to grow in athleticism, he was lost in the sensation. Tommy didn&#39;t even know what he was doing. He just knew it felt so freaking good. Tommy bit his lip harder and then grunted, it even felt like it was swelling in his hand! Gosh, this was nice!<br />
<br />
He wanted to do this every day. Maybe even every hour. And yet as he hungrily pursued his adolescent arousal, he had no idea of the concept that there could be an end point to it. A finish. And then he was rudely interrupted as he felt something boiling up inside him. His balls pulled taut against his body and Tom gasped, &quot;I---I ooooorgh...what is---what is with this!? FUUUUUCK!!!&quot; He was beyond caring that his mom would scold him.<br />
<br />
He watched hot, white liquid pump out of his cock, and Tom grinned, leaning back, he felt so...so good. And he didn&#39;t even know what that was. Just that he liked it oh so very much. But by then, the dizziness was catching up with him. And he realized he might need to get outta there. He certainly felt like he had gone far enough in there. His dad would be proud of him for sure for sticking it out, showing that he could last in there like a man.<br />
<br />
He stumbled up, and Tom found himself balancing on broader, stronger arms. Since when did his arm look like that? The 14 year old Tom that awkwardly almost fell over himself walking to the exit of the sauna was not used to how long and strong his teenaged legs were. Especially by comparison to the boy that had only just walked in there. <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s stomach felt weird. There were like, six ridges there, or something. He didn&#39;t know, but he was one of few young teens in his JV Team blessed with honest, genuine six pack abs. If he had a mentality better matching his body, he might&#39;ve been a cocky athlete eager to show off just how much of puberty&#39;s bounty he&#39;d already acquired. As he was now, he just grunted and stumbled over his own feet, managing to push the door open - and gambol over and out of the hot room.<br />
<br />
So he stood there.<br />
<br />
Suddenly out of the heat and the steam. His shorts looking more like a pair of underwear on him. He looked around and shouted, &quot;Uhh, Miss? Miss? I uhh, I kinda shot sticky white stuff in your like, sauna thing. Sorry about that. I think I got bigger or something in there. Taller. So freaky tall...&quot; He looked around, trying to find her.<br />
<br />
Did she want him to go back in? He felt weird enough as it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey miss!&quot;</p>
