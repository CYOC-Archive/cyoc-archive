<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After having a lot of fun in the party, with women complimenting her about her appearance, she had to go home early due to her age, and her mom picked her up at 9pm.<br />
<br />
But Samantha now worried about her parent’s age. The couple was in their sixties. Far older than what should be the parents for a 12 year old.<br />
With that, she made a wish.<br />
“I wish my parents were 15 years younger”<br />
“That should do it” she thought<br />
<br />
Her mother, Jeniffer, looked a lot better with the years removed, now in her late 40.<br />
<br />
“Well honey, how was the party?” Asked her mother.<br />
“It was amazing mom!” She replied. “I loved it.”<br />
Samantha knew it was best to not brag about how the women complimented her looks and all of that. Especially when parts of the compliments were about her 6’3 stature and size 30I breasts. Better not scare her mom about her hypersexualized 12 year old daughter.<br />
“That’s great to hear sweetie” Jennifer said to her daughter, whose appearance was far from “sweet” like that of a normal kid.<br />
<br />
After parking the car, Jennifer and Samantha left it, and the latter was amazed about their height difference. She had a full foot on her mother! The older woman also had no competition next to her daughter body wise.<br />
<br />
In the front yard, Samantha saw that her father, Chris, also appeared to be younger, probably his early 50s.<br />
Chris was hanging out with some friends. One of which was a tall man at 6’6.<br />
<br />
And Samantha once again felt the vertigo, and fell down.<br />
Her wish, to be “taller than anyone else around”, wasn’t specified to the party, meaning it still applied to her even after it ended.<br />
<br />
Once the feelings cleared, Samantha heard her mother. “Honey, are you alright?”<br />
“I’m fine mom, I just tripped for a moment”<br />
Samantha stood back up, to find herself standing even higher,<br />
“I’m now 6’10. So tall...” she thought to herself silently.<br />
“With you growing up so fast, I’m not surprised your balance didn’t catch up with your body.” Noted her mother.<br />
<br />
The noises or her falling caught the attention of her father and his friends.<br />
“Wow, that girl’s huge! Who is she?” Asked one of the friends<br />
“She’s my little daughter you sick bastard!” yelled Chris<br />
<br />
“Yes” Samantha went to them. “I am only 12 years old”. That statement absolutely shocked some of her father’s friends, the others being used to seeing that amazon of a girl.<br />
<br />
“Though I wouldn’t say I am a ‘little’ girl, dad” she said while standing up straight straight, absolutely dwarfing most of the men, having 4 inches over the tallest one.<br />
“I mean, I grew a lot taller recently, and I also became bigger in other places” she continued while moving her bountiful chest, causing her breasts to jiggle and captivating many of the men.<br />
<br />
This was wrong.<br />
A 12 year old girl with a mind mixed between an adult and a child, a body of a model, the height of a basketball player and huge breasts.<br />
It was very wrong.<br />
But she absolutely loved it.<br />
<br />
“Samantha, we have to go inside, it’s too late”, excused Jennifer, not wanting her daughter to do such things.<br />
And so, Samantha left the men, who now admired her sexy ass.<br />
The closest of whom to her father got a slap from him.<br />
<br />
But as Samantha entered the house, she felt a sharp pain in her forehead.<br />
“Samantha, you forgot you have to duck down now.” Said her mother<br />
“Oh right, I forgot”. Replied the extremely tall girl, before ducking over inside.<br />
For most people, it would have been a bad experience, but due to Samantha’s wish of enjoying her body, she found being too tall for doorframes as another milestone passed.<br />
<br />
Before going to prepare for sleep, Samantha went to eat something in the kitchen, as she didn’t enjoy the meals in the party.<br />
While she ate, there was a knock on the door.<br />
Her mother opened it.<br />
“Hey Jennifer, I forgot my keys at home, can you give me the spare ones I gave you?” The woman asked<br />
“Sure, they’re in the kitchen, but I need help in identifying it.”<br />
“Thank you”<br />
<br />
The two women got to the kitchen, and Samantha saw her neighbor. Just about everything about her body was fake. Her face, her ass, and huge fake breasts as big as her natural ones.<br />
<br />
And then she felt the feeling in her chest again.<br />
Her wish to have “the biggest breasts around” still applied, and it didn’t settle for even competition.<br />
<br />
After a moment, the feeling of her breasts stopped.<br />
Due to her earlier wishes, she knew her cup size.<br />
“30J, this is absolutely insane” she thought to herself as she looked down on the mountains on her chest. Unlike her neighbor’s though, these were natural.<br />
<br />
After stopping to look at them, Samantha noticed her neighbor looking at her, with eyes filled with envy. How could such a young girl be more blessed than her implants?<br />
<br />
Finishing her meal, Samantha went upstairs to shower, noting how small the steps of the stairs looked like, and how she skipped over one with each casual step.<br />
<br />
After ducking under the shower room’s doorframe, she removed her clothes in preparation for the shower, only to see herself in her naked glory in the full length mirror.<br />
<br />
She was absurdly towering, most of her height coming from an extremely long pair of legs. Each well over four feet long.<br />
On the top of these legs was a wide pair of hips with an amazing ass behind.<br />
Her wait was very skinny for her height, but without ribs showing or anything, it didn’t look unhealthy.<br />
If her 30 inch band size was fairly skinny at 5’10, it was extremely so at 6’10.<br />
But the things right above her band were nothing but skinny...<br />
<br />
Her breasts were enormous, each bigger than her head. They were heavy, and jiggled at the slightest movement without the support of her bra.<br />
<br />
And at the top, after a long and elegant neck, was her magnificent face. It looked like it belonged to a young adult woman, and an extremely beautiful one at that.<br />
<br />
She was so hot, and it was so wrong.<br />
<br />
After a quick yet extremely pleasurable wash, feeling the flow of water over her newfound body, Samantha brushed her teeth, went to her bedroom, put on basic pajamas (which were a bit tight), she went into her bed, which was now California king sized.<br />
But it was a fit too tight for Samantha, probably from a time when was was shorter. Which could be only a month or two back in the new reality...<br />
<br />
Samantha used the ring again, and made her wish.<br />
“I wish my bed was big enough for me to fit in comfortably”<br />
And the bed became a Super King sized one.<br />
<br />
Samantha carefully removed the ring from her finger, not wanting to accidentally make wishes when sleeping, but it in a counter next to her, and went to sleep, laying on her back due to her enormous breasts.<br />
She started the day as an older woman, and ended up as an overgrown 12 year old.</p>
