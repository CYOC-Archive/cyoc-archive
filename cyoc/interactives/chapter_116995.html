&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; said Lisa nervously, as Eric entered the room.<br />
<br />
Eric stood silently before Lisa, jaw agape, as he stared at his transformed girlfriend.<br />
<br />
The formerly small petite girl was now tall, standing almost 6 and a half feet tall.  She was practically naked, wearing only a small, tight chain mail bikini, revealing smooth, white perfect skin.  Most shocking was her physique - she was buff, with hard muscles lining her thick thighs and huge biceps.  An impressive six-pack stood out on her well-defined abdomen.  She looked like a bodybuilder!  But she still had a very feminine figure, with wide hips, a narrow waist, and natural D-cup breasts kept perky by her chest muscles and the chain mail bikini top straining to keep them in check.  Mounds of thick, long wavy red hair cascaded down her back.  She looked exactly like his dream girl, the comic book character he had obsessed over for years, brought to life right in front of him - Zera, the barbarian queen!<br />
<br />
Eric was speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;To tell you the truth, I wasn&#39;t too excited about your choice at first.  I mean, this chain mail bikini is chaffing me like crazy, &quot; said Lisa as she turned a little and dug her fingers under the garment, revealing her toned but bountiful ass.  &quot;But I have to admit it feels pretty good.  I kind of like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric slowly moved forward, still awed into silence.  He reached out to gently caress the soft skin lying over her firm biceps muscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Did I give you permission to touch me!?&quot; snarled Lisa, glaring angrily down at Eric.  <br />
<br />
Eric withdrew his hand quickly, backing away a little.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Eric,&quot; said Lisa with a deep chuckle.  &quot;I was just messing with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She slapped him on the back good-naturedly, but the force almost sent him sprawling face forward into the ground. She didn&#39;t just look big.  She was strong, too.  Maybe a little too strong.  Eric was beginning to have second thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Eric. You now have your fantasy girl Zera standing before you.  What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, &quot; said Eric nervously.  &quot;Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  You mean I changed for nothing? This is just some waste of time? Come on, this is your fantasy.  Surely you had something in mind when you spent all that time ogling those pictures on your computer,&quot; said Lisa in a huff.  She stared him down, angrily glaring at him.  Suddenly her eyes went wide and a sly grin spread over her face.  &quot;Oh, I get it.  You want me to take charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa bounded toward Eric. But Eric backed away from her, inching towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa, wait....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no.  I&#39;m not Lisa tonight.  Tonight I am Zera.  And Zera wants to fuck!&quot; said Lisa.  <br />
<br />
Lisa grabbed him by the scruff of his shirt, easily lifting him off the ground.  For a while, they were both silent, shocked by the ease with which she lifted him.  Then Lisa smiled wickedly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You are so light .... it&#39;s like lifting a child...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric struggled a little in her grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not going anywhere, little man. You summoned a goddess, and she demands payment, &quot; said Lisa, as she turned and walked towards the bed, easily holding Eric up with one arm.<br />
<br />
She threw him on the bed roughly, causing him to bounce.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Get undressed,&quot; said Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa, I don&#39;t think....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t a request.  Get undressed!  NOW!&quot; growled Lisa.  &quot;And my name is Zera. If you call me Lisa again, I will punish you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa, I....&quot; <br />
<br />
Lisa glared at him, lifting one eyebrow menacingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, Zera. I just don&#39;t think I can.  I mean, I&#39;m not in the mood...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa ripped open the top of Eric&#39;s pants, revealing his erect cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somehow, I find that hard to believe.  I mean, this is your fantasy, Eric.  Do you really want to miss out on this?&quot; said Lisa, as she reached behind her back, unclasping her metal bra.  It feel to the floor with a clang, revealing large perky D cup breasts with hard nipples on wide pink areola.  She slipped the bikini bottom off her toned legs, revealing her smooth tight pussy. &quot;Just say the word and I&#39;ll stop... find some other way to satisfy my needs.  Or you can stay and.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric remained silent, in awe of her beauty. She was perfect, exactly like he dreamed she would be in real life.  How could he resist?  He wanted to make love to her more desperately than anything in the world.  And his cock responded in kind, pulsing, throbbing and growing harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I thought, &quot; said Lisa with a smile, as she ripped off his clothes like tissue paper.<br />
<br />
The bed groaned under Lisa&#39;s weight as she climbed on top of it.  Lisa sat astride Eric, her moist cunt just above Eric&#39;s eager dick.  Then with a grunt she pressed down, sending Eric&#39;s cock slithering up her tight wet pussy.<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s eyes went wide.  She hadn&#39;t expect it feel so good.  Sex with Eric had never felt like this before.  It was like her new pussy was tighter, more sensitive, and with more muscle control.  Each thrust of her groin sent waves of pleasure rocketing through her body. It was ecstasy.  But she wanted more.  She couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it would feel like if Eric had a little bit more down there.  He wasn&#39;t small by any means, just a little average.  As she continued to ride Eric she began to plot a few changes for him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she felt Eric straining a little beneath her.  She knew what that meant.  She could tell by the look on his face that he was getting ready to blow.  But she was nowhere near her own release.  But that was Eric.  Always finishing a little too early.  But not tonight, not when she had the upper hand.  <br />
<br />
Lisa reached down and grabbed Eric by the throat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t, you little worm.  You don&#39;t cum, not before me.  If you do, I&#39;ll cut off your little pecker,&quot; she said huskily.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s eyes went wide and she felt a twinge of guilt.  But he soon complied.  She could feel his pole rising back to full mast. And it felt so good she no longer felt any guilt, just pleasure.  She ground her pelvis relentlessly and fervently, bringing herself to orgasm, with Eric following soon after.<br />
<br />
Lisa rolled off Eric with satisfaction, his softening dick sliding out of her wet cunt with an audible pop.  Strangely, she felt no fatigue or exhaustion.  Her body was flushed with adrenaline.  Her muscles begged to be used, to test their limits. And her body yearned for more excitement.  But she could tell that Eric was spent.<br />
<br />
She patted him gently but firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, boy.  You served your queen well.  Now get your rest.  I am going to take a quick shower and get cleaned up.  Then I expect my servant to be ready for another round,&quot; said Lisa.<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s feet thudded on the ground as her sweaty nude body sashayed towards the shower.  Eric felt his penis try to stir, still enthralled by the sight of her beautiful body.  But it just wasn&#39;t up the task and remained limp.  Hell, Eric wasn&#39;t sure he was up to the task.  It had been the best sex of his life, the most intense sex of his life.  But he wasn&#39;t sure if he could do a repeat performance.  And what was up with Lisa&#39;s attitude?  Was it just harmless role play or had the machine somehow altered her personality?  Or maybe she had always been like this, her dominant side just hiding below the surface waiting for the chance to be released?  <br />
<br />
As he heard Lisa turn on the water, Eric looked over at the Chronivac.  Maybe he should change her back.  Sure, she might be a little angry that he ended the game early, but they could always play again later.  But did he really want to give up the fun so early?  It had been the best sex of his life.  He was kind of curious to see what Lisa had in mind for him next. Maybe he should just tinker with himself a little, give himself some more stamina or something.  After all, he might need some extra help keeping up with Lisa.  From the sounds coming from the bathroom it seemed like she was still horny, pleasuring herself in the shower.  He struggled to get off the bed, but felt weak.  Maybe it was just best to lie down for a little bit, get a little nap. After a short rest he could clear his muddled mind and think clearly, devising a better plan.</p>
