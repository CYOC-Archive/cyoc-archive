<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh looked at the image that was projected in front of him. The hologram of a cartoony-looking anthropomorphic mouse slowly rotated, letting him observe that body from every angle. And he liked what he saw. He knew that the resort could take anything, no matter how weird, and make people believe it had always been that way. Why not really put that amazing power to the test? See if reality could possibly reshape itself around a synthetic rubber creature living a completely normal life, as boring as any other human or anthro you passed on the street?<br />
<br />
He was tempted to just hit the button and try out this new form as-is. But he remembered to change one thing first. He&#39;d spent enough time being carried around in an enormous tiger&#39;s jaws for one day - and he could always go back to that size later, anyway. Pulling the size slider to the right, he watched the holographic figure grow in front of him. Josh couldn&#39;t remember off the top of his head exactly how tall Yuki normally was, but he remembered her being pretty short. He stopped when the three-dimensional image was tall enough to look him in the eyes. He wanted to stare at that voluptuous figure for a little longer, but he reminded himself that he&#39;d have plenty of time to see it when it was his own body. Reaching up a paw, he batted it at the &quot;Confirm&quot; button, and everything went black.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Yuki blinked. She was still looking down with her nose in her phone, waiting for a reply to the message she&#39;d just sent in the group chat. But something was different. Why was her nose sticking out so far in front of her face that it almost touched the screen?<br />
<br />
Then a flood of memories hit her. She remembered that she was actually Josh, although she still thought of herself first and foremost as Yuki. She realized she must not have been completely immune to the mental changes that the resort was currently implanting on all of her friends. But even though she answered to the name &quot;Yuki&quot; now, and had her memories taking precedence over his, she knew that Josh&#39;s personality traits had replaced hers. She remembered how, just a few moments ago, she was incredibly nervous and questioning why she&#39;d even agreed to come to an unpredictable place like this. Now that feeling was gone, replaced by excitement - and arousal.<br />
<br />
Yuki looked down at her chest. Her cleavage poked out of her top - exactly how it looked a minute ago, except for the smooth, white, rubbery texture of her skin. But the sight of those breasts was very exciting to her - which was strange, because she&#39;d had them for years and never felt this way before. Josh&#39;s sexuality must have completely overtaken hers, too. She couldn&#39;t resist reaching a hand into her bra and starting to feel herself up, even as she was standing here in the middle of a public place. Now <i>that</i> was something she would never have even dreamed of doing before.<br />
<br />
As she fondled herself, she heard a soft squeaking noise - well, actually, two squeaks that came from her at about the same time. One was the jarring noise of rubber skin rubbing against rubber skin, as her hand slid smoothly around the curves of her bouncy breasts. The other squeak escaped the lips at the end of her long muzzle, sounding like a cross between an ordinary mouse and an inflated chew toy being squeezed. She was going to have a lot of fun with this flexible new body.<br />
<br />
But it would have to wait. Her phone buzzed in her other hand, with a message saying that the rest of the group was on their way over to her location. It was surprisingly easy to use the touch screen, considering that her thumbs (like every other part of her body) were now made of a material that would slide around frictionlessly on the glass.<br />
<br />
That made something occur to her. She had Yuki&#39;s memories, and she had Josh&#39;s memories. But she didn&#39;t know a thing about what this body&#39;s life was normally like. She tried to remember being a rubber mouse woman like this before, and came up empty. If she was going to stay like this around her friends, who would remember her always being this way, she would have to improvise. (Of course, she could retreat into the void at any time and fix that little mistake - <i>but what would be the fun in that?</i>, Josh&#39;s more adventurous personality told her.)<br />
<br />
Her large, sensitive ears told her that someone was approaching, with just enough time for her to yank her arm out of her cleavage before they came around the corner. It was no surprise to see Maya, Sasha, and a full-grown tiger walking toward her. The moment Yuki&#39;s eyes fell on them, a battle started to play out in her brain. She knew all these people from two completely different perspectives, felt two different ways about each of them, had different relationships and memories to contend with. Was Maya one of her closest and most trusted friends, or a bitchy girl who had never liked Josh one bit? Yuki knew she&#39;d - or Josh had - made sure to keep Anna - Andrew - as her fiancé(e), but what would happen to the platonic friendship between the two women? This reality&#39;s Yuki probably had a completely different set of relationships with all of them, and she was about to find out what that meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have expected you to scare that easily, Yuki,&quot; Maya said as she approached, playfully grabbing the mouse-girl by the ear. Being yanked like that didn&#39;t hurt in quite the way she was expecting. When Maya put her claws around one of the large circles that stuck out several inches above her hair, her entire head stretched with it. Her field of vision got narrower as her facial features squished together, her long snout bouncing up and down as her whole upper body was pulled taut like a string. It was uncomfortable as hell, and yet Yuki was left disappointed when the fox let go of her a moment later, letting everything suddenly bounce in the opposite direction. Her body shook back and forth until it eventually rested in the same standing pose where she&#39;d started. &quot;You&#39;re usually the bravest one out of the four of us,&quot; Maya finished casually, as if she hadn&#39;t just given Yuki the most disorienting thrill ride of her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-uh, yeah, I was just a little overwhelmed by everything they&#39;ve got here,&quot; Yuki replied, her formerly timid nature starting to come back to her involuntarily. &quot;Plus, I wanted to check out what the resort had going on over he- a-aa-aaah!&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt a very unfamiliar sensation coming from her rear end. Yuki looked behind herself to find Andrew pulling at her tail with his powerful jaws. Those sharp teeth were poking at her skin painfully as the tiger held the end of her tail firmly in his mouth. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said as he spat her out. &quot;Couldn&#39;t help myself. I see the way Maya &#39;plays&#39; with you all the time, and I wanted to try out a body that would let me chew on you even better than she does. Didn&#39;t mean to scare you. See, this is why we should have flown here together, rather than having you travel with them. You know, since we&#39;re getting <i>married</i> and all, Yuki...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, lay off it, Anna,&quot; Maya said, reaching for Yuki&#39;s arm with her paw-like hand. &quot;Sorry. <i>Andrew.</i> You know how much your girlfriend loves it when I gnaw on her. And I keep telling you, it&#39;s <i>not</i> a sexual thing. It&#39;s what synthetics like her were literally made for!&quot; Then, as if to prove her point, she yanked on Yuki&#39;s hand, stretching it out further and further until she could easily fit her maw around it and start chomping down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah?&quot;, Andrew replied from behind Yuki&#39;s butt. &quot;Well, by the time I&#39;m done with her, she won&#39;t need you for that anymore! Now that I have the resort helping me, I&#39;m gonna show her the chew-toy time of her life. The kind of rough play that only a big predator like this can pull off. And I&#39;m gonna prove that it <i>can</i> be a sexual thing, if you do it right!&quot; And he started gnawing on her leg with all his might. Both Andrew and Maya started to pull back with their strong jaws, until Yuki was getting stretched out and suspended between the two of them, feeling the intense deformation of her body from both sides.<br />
<br />
Yuki, meanwhile, was trying to figure out just what she&#39;d done to herself. In this reality, it seemed like she was nothing more than a living plaything, a walking stress-reliever for the anthros and other sharp-toothed creatures of the world. Now two of them were having a tug-of-war with her, pulling hard in opposite directions as they fought for dominance - without bothering to ask what she wanted them to do. She would be lying if she said she wasn&#39;t enjoying the attention, though, even if she was a little worried they would rip her soft rubber body in half. And it was all completely normal - she noticed Sasha with a bored expression on her face, rolling her eyes and muttering &quot;Anthros...&quot; before going back to looking at her phone.</p>
