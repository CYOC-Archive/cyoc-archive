<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Alex came home, he got back into bed, thinking that he fooled his parents again.  He doesn&#39;t even bother to hide the cocaine that he had bought from this guy in a drawer or something because he is so wasted.  It had to be 6 in the morning when he got back, so he must have been exhausted.  After getting some sleep, he slept in until 1 in the afternoon on a Sunday; his parents didn&#39;t even bother to wake him up for church that day because he didn&#39;t have anything presentable and he would cause trouble when he was there.  When he woke up, he noticed something strange was going on but he didn&#39;t know what it was.  <br />
<br />
&#39;Is it the room?  No, it&#39;s still a fucking mess.  Maybe I should clean it, but I&#39;m too lazy and I don&#39;t have time to do something like that,&#39; he thought.  He questioned himself again, &#39;Could it be me?  I mean, I got pretty wasted last night and I&#39;m probably just hungover.  But I always come home feeling like this when I&#39;m wasted; maybe I should just stop drinking so fucking much, it might help me do more.&#39;  After wondering for the next half hour, he decided that he wouldn&#39;t ever know what it was and ignorance is bliss.  He turned on his laptop that his parents bought him for school and, after it completely loaded, he went straight to that porn website that he always went to.  However, he got more disgusted by it and not as turned on by it as usual and decided to stop watching the content.  He pondered more about what might be happening, but he couldn&#39;t think of what was going on.<br />
<br />
Another couple of hours pass by and his parents come home; they tend to stay away from the house as long as possible while Alex isn&#39;t.  &quot;Ugh...  Why can&#39;t I just move out already so that I can just have sex and be drugged up whenever I want without the &#39;fun police&#39; being there,&quot; Alex groans to himself.  He got up, went to a spot on his floor that had actually mildly presentable clothes and put them on.  The outfit consisted of a sleeved t-shirt and athletic shorts.  Unbeknownst to Alex, he was starting to mature in the correct direction, rather than in the direction that he had been heading, one that was filled with inevitable regret and sexually transmitted diseases.  However, he wouldn&#39;t be completely there for the next couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
The next day was Monday, and since Alex hated Mondays, he decided not to show up for school.  His school was a typical public middle school, and although Alex was supposed to be in high school, he had been held back two grades in the process.  Even though he chose not to go to school, something still irked him about the truancy that he was committing.  Alex looked at his clock, &#39;It says 7:15.  You know what, I shouldn&#39;t lay here all day, I&#39;ll just get bored.&#39;  He quickly got ready for school and ran out the door and tried to make it before 7:30, when school started.  He got there just in time for his first class, history, the one he hated the most.  &#39;Maybe I should have just stayed at home, this class is so awful...&#39; he thought with dread but still felt accomplished that he would actually do something productive today.  After a boring day at school, Alex got home and to the surprise of his parents.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Alex!  I thought you were dead,&quot; his mom screamed, assuming that Alex had gotten lost on the way home from having sex.  &quot;We almost called the police!  Where have you been?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went to school...&quot; he replied with honest concern that his parents actually thought he would do that.  &#39;But wait, I might have actually done something like that today if I hadn&#39;t gone to school.  What is going on today?  These past couple of days have been so weird.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  This can&#39;t be!&quot; his mom exclaimed only slightly sarcastically, &quot;You chose to go to school on a Monday?  I am so proud of you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Now,&#39; Alex thought offended, &#39;That is something I knew my bitch of a mom would say.&#39;  &quot;Thanks mom,&quot; he said.  Alex went up to his and got a shock.  His giant pile of clothes that was right next to his bed was only a few articles on the floor and a laundry basket had appeared in his room.  Also, due to that most likely, his room didn&#39;t stink as much.  &quot;Wow, I don&#39;t remember getting so fucking organized.  It must have been my parents.&quot;  After that shock, he decided to go to bed.</p>
