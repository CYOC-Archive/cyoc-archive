<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So where should we go?&quot;  John asked.  &quot;And how do we know we can trust you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I could have killed your friend with ease, from there it would be just as easy to kill both of you before you ever drew your gun, but I didn't even hurt him.  As for your first question, we can go to a small village about 20 miles southwest of here.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Southwest, there's nothing to the southwest.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Our people tend to keep themselves hidden the town is underground, I can show you it when we get there.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I still don't trust you.&quot;  John said again.<br />
  &quot;You can either come with me and risk possible danger or stay here and die its your choice.&quot;<br />
  He started walking down the road to the next stop.  Marcia and Thomas followed and John came too after a few seconds.<br />
  &quot;My car is at the next exit, we can take it to the village.&quot;<br />
  They got to his car and drove for a while taking the first turn off onto a dirt road.  He stopped by a tall stone and got out.<br />
  &quot;So where's your secret village?&quot;  John asked sarcastically.<br />
  The man ignored him and placed his right hand on the rock.<br />
  &quot;Maximus Robertus Lupus.&quot;  He said as a stairway revealed itself in the dirt.  He turned to face John.  &quot;You were saying?&quot;<br />
  John walked past him without saying anything and Marcia looked at the man who had led them here.<br />
  &quot;That didn't sound like a traditional latin name to me, was it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I wouldn't know.  I know they used a three name system but that about it.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I guess your real name is Robert then right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah, but we need to get into the village so everything can be explained.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I already know about the Canius stone.  It's believed to have come into existance in the year 1195 bc and has the ability to turn humans into what Thomas has become.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I'm afraid it's a little more complicatedd then that so if you'll just follow me.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So how is it that Thomas now has control over his wolf form?&quot;<br />
  &quot;He always did the beast that a lot of your kind refer to, is no more than instinct which can be easily overruled with concentration.  Your friend has shown remarkable control over these instincts but it will still take some time before he can have full control, unfortunately, since he broke the stone, we won't have that kind of time.&quot;<br />
  Marcia wanted ask him something but didn't, she knew what he was talking about.  when the statue broke, she could feel something.  She didn't know what it was but she did know that it was evil.<br />
  They were quiet for a while, until they reached the bottom of the stairs.  The city looked any other small town you would find in the US except that it was inside a cave.  Marcia wanted to change the course of the conversation.<br />
  &quot;Your right eye is magnificent, though I guess its common in your species.&quot;<br />
  &quot;surprisingly no.  only a handful of us have yellow eyes period and its considered a sign of strength and leadership.<br />
  &quot;I can see that.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Actually I'm the first one in my family since...well let's just say the last one to have them in the year bc 1195, sound familiar?&quot;<br />
  Marcia looked at him astonished.<br />
  &quot;so he's...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah here's his picture.&quot;<br />
  She looked up at the photo of a huge man, muscles overflowing his shirt towering over his wife.<br />
  &quot;He was the most evil figure in our species' history.  He slaughtered thousands of people.  He was accompanied by some of the great generals of every species.  Hercules the lion.  Achilles, the tiger.  Odysseus the fox.&quot;<br />
  &quot;These are all from Greek myths.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yes, our people are clever as are the other species.  We left clues throughout history giving proof of their existance in the least likely place of all.  Our friend here was Zeus himself, though that wasn't his real name.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Didn't he come before this?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You'd be surprised at how our people can make it seem that way, but that's not the main problem.  When he was going around killing all these people his own wife, Hera, began to grow concerned with his power.  She told Zeus that she could make him immortal and spread evil, throughout the world, if he allowed her to cast a spell on him.  He agreed to this spell and had all his generals changed as well.<br />
  &quot;After, she locked him in his stone prison she hid the statues across Greece and 8 months later she gave birth to triplets, 2 sons and 1 daughter.  The line of one of her sons has died out while the other one led down to me.<br />
  &quot;I'm the strongest of his descendents ever.  Making the second strongest wolf ever to exist.  I also inheritted his speed, leadership ability and fighting instincts.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Then you can help us beat him&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, I already told you that yellow eyes are a sign of strength in wolves but for my family its a sign of evil.  Without these bonds that I wear on my wrists and around my neck, I would be a savage killer myself.  I can't even risk changing into my wolf form without my other side breaking through.  If I get close to him, that evil will surface even in my wolf form and I'll join him as one of his generals.&quot;</p>
