<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By accident ago, your finger hit and brought up one choice. &#39;Squirrel&#39; the choices available all seemed the same but with minor color variations. Choosing &#39;red squirrel&#39;, as it appeared to be the common, you were then simply presented with a time selector and no description of what it was for. Shrugging, you choose ten minutes since you didn&#39;t exactly wait forever but if it was some kind of show. Lastly, you got a dial listing from one to fifteen. Again, with no frame of reference, ten seems a good start considering you&#39;re in the dark on the meaning.<br />
<br />
After making your selection, you get a cartoon squirrel giving you a thumbs up before a ten minute digital timer shows up on the screen and then starts to count down.<br />
<br />
It was nearly forty-five seconds in and you were left scratching your head out of befuddlement.<br />
<br />
It felt like it came all at once; a sensation like a railroad spike being driven into your tailbone. So hard and painful was the sensation that you bent forward, nearly smashing the screen. Your grunt and groan, trying to focus on exactly what&#39;s hurting but the pain is also coming as numb fizz before a poking at the top of your jeans had you immediately worried.<br />
<br />
You reach back, unsure if something had slipped in and bit you, like a spider. What you find at first almost confirms this as something is indeed squirming back there like some massive giant leg. You get some of your wits together and get the round growth that you trace back to your tailbone is actually a tail. It&#39;s right then that also, with some mercy, your pants rip and you can now see the new appendage squirming out. It&#39;s hairless and pink and looked almost like a finger until a tip formed and the length grew to nearly nine inches. The shocking sight of it was nothing compared to the fact you could feel it too.<br />
<br />
Your face twitched as numb sensations mixed with twitches and odd sensations from other parts of your body. Turning again to face the screen, all but the green numbers showing eight minutes twenty-eight seconds were now black, allowed the screen to reflect your not entirely human face.<br />
<br />
Your ears had tugged up, which was only more noticeable when you turned your head. Worse, when you went to touch the very tip of the newly formed ears, red fur started to sprout of the top to touch your finger tips first. You pull your fingers back in revulsion, just as your jaw starts to ache horribly. Covering your face with your hands, you make muffled noises while the tail that was now nearly a foot and a half lone of ropiness. <br />
<br />
The cracking and crunching of bone in his mouth mixed with an odd bit of tickling at your nose makes you more and more nervous to move your hands so you refuse to do so. <br />
<br />
Another wave of pain hits, this time it&#39;s your feet that are the source. The tips of your toes were bunching into the front of the show and beyond that, your nails felt like they had grown too. Still, you kept your face mostly covered. Even as you could feel the teeth growing, you trying and ignore it.<br />
<br />
A subtle tremble starts in your body around the five minute mark and it becomes clear after a few moments more that you had lost a good of weight. Getting closer and smelling you would reveal some of the reason, as sweat reeked off your body. Your pants were looser on your waist and even widening your stance way proving an ineffective way to keep them up without at least one hand. Glancing back at the reflection, your ears were oversized a bit but were red, furry squirrel ears and your hands simply dropped away in amazement.<br />
<br />
Your nose had squished into a brown one, with some fur sprouted around it, and a pair of buck teeth as well. Add to all of that was the softer look to all of your features, making you look a fair touch more feminine that you ever recall. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it was that tinge of female you see in the reflection that caused the first twinge in your cock but from there it wasn&#39;t all pleasure. Gritting your new teeth, you feel your tail grow longer still, trying to match your body length while also finally taking on a plume of red fur. Bits of red fur had also started to spread into your head from your ears and down into your taint and inner thighs from your tail. After a brief erection, your cock leaks empty a milky cum and the most sickening and vicious feeling grabs your testicles and wrenches them inward around the three minute and fifty second mark.<br />
<br />
Your balls and then your cock are pulled into the fur of your crotch, never to be seen again and despite your best efforts, you lose grip on your pants and they fall around your feet. The hair on your head shedding, you&#39;re reduced to simply crying while a short snout and whiskers make your face more bestial. Once that happens and two minutes hits, you&#39;re somewhat of a breastless anthropomorphic squirrel girl. That changes quickly as your size starts to diminish and you really start to panic.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re trying to cry out as only your shirt remains and your hands are being crunched into claws. Your cries get quieter and quieter as your lungs decrease in size, much like how they become less and less human the more of a squirrel you become. Brushing low, you&#39;re aware enough to know you&#39;re female and could only hope this wouldn&#39;t last.<br />
<br />
With a minute to go, you were crawling out of your shirt with much of your body now now more fit in a park or zoo. At sometime around fifty seconds left, you began to spontaneously ovulate and at thirty seconds, ten male squirrels were let in.<br />
<br />
Your last male, human thought was that you wanted to go home.<br />
<br />
Your last thought as a human was that you were scared.<br />
<br />
Your first thought as a squirrel is hot many big your litter would be.<br />
<br />
And as the time reached the final second, the first male mounting and forcibly shoved and human thoughts out. Every one had a go at you before a side door opened and all the squirrels were shooed out by the ride operator who raided your wallet before burning the rest. Thankfully, you were right where you were belonged.</p>
