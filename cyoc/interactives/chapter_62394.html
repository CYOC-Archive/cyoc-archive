<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It's a beautiful mornin' (ahhh). I think I'll go outside a while. And just smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
The radio alarm went off at precisely 7:00. The clock sat on a window sill next to a bed with someone in it inside a small room. Othher <br />
components of the room were a desk with a laptop on it and a small dresser. From beneath the sheets of the bed came a strange <br />
tentacle. However, instead of being slimy or fleshy, it was covered in a sleek brown fur and had no suction cups. It slowly snaked its way <br />
to the alarm and turned it off. It retracted back into the covers and disappeared. Soon afterwards, the sheets were flipped off by a hand <br />
that looked human, but was covered in the same brown fur and was equipped with pads and claws.<br />
<br />
The hand was attached to a strong and lithe body likewise covered in brown fur with a thick tail and powerful legs. The body led to the <br />
head of an otter with a lighter brown fur under the lower lip down to the V of the neck. The otter head yawned and opened its brilliant <br />
purple eyes. They seemed to glow with a strange energy and a matching stripe of fur crossed the left eye diagonally like a scar. The <br />
anthro otter scratched himself and blinked himself awake along with a few more yawns. There was no sign of the mysterious tentacle. <br />
<br />
He stood up and the covers fell off of his lap, revealing his quite large sack and sheath. He scratched down there once for good <br />
measure before finding a pair of underwear and an outfit of athletic shorts and a muscle-shirt that hugged his well-defined chest. The <br />
lower garments had holes in them for his rudder-like tail to fit through. Just as he finished dressing, his laptop flashed to life from its <br />
sleep mode with a video call. <br />
<br />
In the process of putting on his watch, the otter did not move to the laptop. But instead, a tentacle identical to the first one sprouted <br />
seamlessly from his exposed shoulder and hit a few buttons on the computer. An image of a man in his fifties with greying beard, <br />
moustache, and hair popped up on screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fisk, how many times do I have to tell you to be careful about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay dad,&quot; the otter answered, turning and approaching the screen while the tentacle disappeared back inside his body. &quot;I'm in my <br />
room, the door's locked, the blinds are turned up, and my roommates probably aren't even awake yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be that as it may, if you get too comfortable with your power you might slip up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just tired dad, once I wake up I promise I'll do everything the old-fashioned way. So was there a reason you called me at...7:15 in <br />
the morning? Or do you just miss me?&quot; Fisk asked flashing an overly cute otter smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll be missing you a whole lot more here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? And why's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going on a business trip to Europe for the rest of the month. I just found out earlier this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa still kicking you around the business?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I suppose it's better than having him at home to bother your mother 24/7. The old man may be 98 this Friday, but he's still got <br />
plenty of juice in his battery. But just in case, I want you to call the plant every day while I'm gone and see how he's holding up. Don't <br />
call him, though, I have one of our interns watching him. I'll send you the number. You know how Grandpa just got the new cybernetic <br />
leg, so I want to make sure he's not pushing himself. Even with the technology and medicine we have today, 98's still an old age. And <br />
don't be afraid to check in on your mother. You know how Eric can get when he thinks his dad or big brother isn't watching.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, aye captain!&quot; Fisk mock saluted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Smart-ass,&quot; his dad chuckled, &quot;Alright, see you next month.&quot;<br />
<br />
The screen blacked out while a woman's voice said, &quot;VexCo. thanks you for your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently he called from work,&quot; Fisk smirked. <br />
<br />
The screen then returned to its normal desktop with an IM window containing the number for the intern Fisk's dad had told him about. <br />
He saved it and put the computer back to sleep. He headed for the door and walked out into the hall. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing it's summer semester,&quot; Fisk thought to himself, &quot;Or I'd have trouble trying to squeeze those calls in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The otter walked down the short hall into the living room of the dorm suite. He shared the suite with two other boys. Jason was a furry <br />
as well, a slim grey fox with blue-dyed head fur, while Brandon was a blond Caucasian human with a jock physique. The three were <br />
best friends now in their sophomore year of college and had done everything in their power to make sure they were roommates again. <br />
And with Fisk being the next heir of VexCo. Technologies, he held a lot of sway over the furry members of the housing committee. <br />
<br />
He sat down on the sofa and flicked on the TV. He had only watched a few minutes of the news when a still-groggy Jason plopped <br />
down on the other end of the couch. Jason had a tendency to forget that he wasn't in his parent's apartment anymore and often walked <br />
out of his room with no clothes on. He was an only child and his parents had both gone to work early, so he had become accustomed <br />
to waking up and sitting around naked. Even after a year of college, he still did this at least three times a week. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jason?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he mumbled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pants?&quot; Fisk laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn't a big deal. Jason was gay and Brandon and Fisk were bisexual so they had seen—and touched—each others' naked bodies <br />
before. But there was such a thing as too comfortable.<br />
<br />
While Jason put on some clothes, Brandon came into the room. He sat in the chair facing sideways, each boy had their own designated <br />
spot and they were respected. As Brandon was usually the last one up, he looked at Jason's empty spot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forgot his pants?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Fisk affirmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I didn't know any better I'd say he's trying to seduce us,&quot; Brandon chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you did know better,&quot; Jason said as he walked back into the room, &quot;You'd know I was trying to seduce you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Faggot,&quot; Brandon remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right,&quot; Jason sent it right back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well before you two start stripping in front of me,&quot; Fisk said, &quot;I'm going to go get some breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better make sure they have plenty of cream for Jason!&quot; Brandon joked as he walked out the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;And he calls me a faggot,&quot; Jason shook his head. <br />
**********************************************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Fisk, you're so big,&quot; the shapely anthro cat girl moaned as she slid herself onto his meat. <br />
<br />
He had picked her up at a party one of Brandon's friends had invited them to and they had all returned to their respective rooms with <br />
their respective partners. They were all a bit buzzed and all a bit pent-up, so this had been the expected outcome. Fisk wasn't so <br />
buzzed that he put safety aside. He had called a cab for the six of them and was wearing a condom, but that didn't detract from his fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've never been so...filled!&quot; she cooed. <br />
<br />
She was a beautiful girl with a perfect shape, large breasts, and soft blue-grey fur. Though maybe it was just the alchohol, bu Fisk <br />
couldn't help thinking she was a bit of a slut. She had practically thrown herself on him as soon as he got to the party, but she was <br />
already drunk by the time he had gotten there. <br />
<br />
Brandon had scored a busty rabbit girl and Jason had met a cute chocolate lab boy. Fisk could hear the moans on either side of his <br />
room through the thin walls. He focused back on the cat girl, Alexis he thought she had introduced herself, and her perfect gliding <br />
movement on his cock. He could feel his balls churning, aching for release, but he wanted to hold on as long as possible. Alexis's crotch <br />
became wet and Fisk knew that was a good sign. If you can outlast a woman, you know you're pleasing her. It was soon too much for <br />
him and he shot his load into the condom. <br />
<br />
Alexis sighed and laid down on him, but Fisk knew she would fall asleep there. So he gently pulled out, disposed of the condom, and <br />
tucked her into his bed. He then grabbed a blanket and headed for the couch. He hadn't even closed he door before she was purring in <br />
her sleep. <br />
<br />
Out in the living room, Brandon was already reclined in his chair with his own blanket, fast asleep. As Fisk settled onto the couch, he <br />
saw Jason stick his head out his door. The fox gave him a thumbs up before a brown paw pulled him back in. Fisk chuckled to himself <br />
as he settled into the couch and fell asleep.</p>
