<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Andy thought it was a bit strange that a fairy he'd just met would help him to get to a spring that was supposed to be forbidden, but he wanted to be a guy so badly it didn't matter.  The prospect of being stuck inside this fantasy world wasn't as horrible as being a seven inch high fairy girl.  As much as he didn't understand how his consciousness was offloaded into The Kingdom, priorities were priorities.</p>

<p>The little pale skinned, orange-red haired fairy girl with blue eyes slowly fluttered up through Amberpine Forest.  Andy had been this far out before as his wood elf, Elvis, without ever stumbling across a hidden spring.  Amy knew, though, that this was a Level Twenty-ish zone and was far too dangerous for her Level Five self.  Still, even if she died, she should be able to find someone to resurrect her as normal.</p>

<p>Amy considered her last thought as she flew up and sat for a moment on a tree branch, looking around.  What would it feel like to die?  She'd never bothered to think about it much before since she was outside the world and even mostly playing in third person.  If something out here were to eat her, it would hurt, wouldn't it?  All the rest of this was so real.</p>

<p>She looked down at her little yellow shirt and blue short-shorts that she'd found laying out in the woods close to where she'd woken up.  There were red straps going up and over each shoulder, but she felt a bit of a breeze as her clothing had not included underwear.  Amy tilted her head back the way she had come and wondered what the previous owner of this 'Amy' had been doing just before she logged off to have found the character nude with her cloths laying near by.</p>

<p>At this thought, she felt a slight pang in her belly as if she hadn't eaten in a while.  She was hungry, but wondered how that transferred so easily into the game if she herself&#151;or, rather, Andy&#151;had just eaten before diving into the game.  Looking around, she found herself to be in an apple tree.</p>

<p>"Another amazingly handy coincidence," she commented aloud to herself, realizing she even sounded like Misty from Pokemon.  Se was a bit of a fan of the show back in the 90's, but hadn't been watching it for a while.  It was a bit curious how someone could so exactly duplicate an existing character without anyone picking up on it… but then again, who drops a nude Level Five fair off in the woods alone before they log out.</p>

<p>Amy reached out and began pulling on an apple above her that was just about her size.  A cool breeze blew up under her denim short shorts and up under her midriff yellow shirt across her nipples.  Both gave her a little chill down her spine and she grew a little wet with a shiver.  She gripped the apple hard and pulled it off of it's vine without realizing how hard she had clenched.  It fell to one side, hitting her in the face, and dropping her and it down to the forest floor with a hard whack.</p>

<p>She took a deep breath as she lay on the soil, the wind having been knocked out of her.  Something was off if she was that aroused over a chilly breeze.  Not even Andy's second girlfriend was that quick to ready and she was <i>easy</i>.  She frowned a bit and tried the hand-motion that would normally bring up the overhead display of her character sheet which only she could see.  Instead of a 3D digital overlay, there appeared a parchment from the air.</p>

<p>She blinked and snatched it, looking it over.  The character's name was actually 'Tristy' with the last name 'Chatchem'.  Amy made a grown as she looked over all the details of this poor Fairy.  She'd been played for only six hours on one night almost four months ago.  She'd been left on Auto-Pilot after an encounter with a butterfly-winged male fairy and her had an encounter in the bushes back where she'd loaded into the character.</p>

<p>She tried to take a bite out of the apple as she read the long slide of paper.  The few events of the character's history were all there for her to read.  The encounter with the male bothered her as that meant she probably loaded into the character 'just after' she'd been with a male.  Hopefully not an NPC as he'd still be around in the forest somewhere if that was true.</p>

<p>As Amy made her way close to the core of the apple a little bit at a time, her stomach felt full but her belly still ached.  The apple didn't quite agree with her and soon she was hurrying over to a bush and kneeling down to throw up in the cover there.  Part of her wanted to coat the apple in peanut butter and pickles, thinking that would solve the flavor problem.  It was then that she wiped off her face with a leaf and looked back at the character sheet.</p>

<p>The parchment said 'Fertility Treatment' under the Perks.  It also said 'Accelerated Lifespan', 'Sensual Touch' and 'Soul Pass' as well under the Merits and Flaws.  "Who in the hell made this character?" Amy asked alive, her eyes going wide.  "Fertility Treatment, great… someone wanted to guarantee kids from sex…" she frowned, thinking it could also including <i>multiple</i> children.  "Accelerated Lifespan could force this character to live anywhere from normal human lifespan to only weeks, depending on the kind of fairy," she spoke aloud to herself.  "I don't know fairies too well, but Soul Pass is horrible."</p>

<p>Soul Pass meant that whenever her next child was born, the Player would continue into the new character's body.  Perhaps the parent or other sibling would even end up dead.  If she was feeling ill due to pregnancy like she suspected, this could all be much worse than she had originally forecast.  <i>With the lifespan messed up like this, it would mean that the child or children would be born in hours or days instead of months…</i> she worried, <i>and that really doesn't help matters,</i> she added as she got to her feet.</p>

<p>Amy looked at the apple and sighed, hopping back up into the air, the cold wind blowing over her tiny form once again, her nipples going hard.  The 'Sensual Touch' was her current problem… it would mean that her flesh, all of it, would overreact in a pleasurable way to all touch.  As bothersome and enjoyable that might be, if someone started to try and take advantage of her, how would she resist?</p>

<p>First day with TIS, and everything just hits the fan.  She had to find a way to fix one or all of her problems.  Kids were out of the question, being a girl was not helping matters, getting wet at every little thing was distracting, and knowing that she was going to age quickly and be dead unless she had an offspring.  It was almost as if someone made a throw-away character in the hopes someone would be unlucky enough to play them.</p>

<p>"I gotta get out of The Kingdom… maybe a moderator can help me?" she wondered, flying in the direction the other fairy had pointed out to her as being a cursed spring.  She had long since forgotten he'd too easily given her the information or that it was suspicious in any way.  If she could be male, human, human-sized, or all of the above… that would finally be a step in the right direction.</p></p>
