<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Security work at student events was always a bore, or so Professor Richard (no relation to Danny Thompson&#39;s father) Jones thought. There was either nothing happening or some students were fucking in the hallway, drugged and drunk off their rockers. There was no in-between. <br />
<br />
This one, so far, seemed little different. There was the hint of debauchery right at the door, where people were encouraged to use sex toys for some reason. The dean should have never allowed that, of course, but after his unfortunate transformation, he&#39;d displayed a stunning reversal on his previous positions. A dick on its own couldn&#39;t be considered obscene anymore, or so the campus new code of conduct dictated. And would until they recovered the dean or elected a new one. <br />
<br />
This campus was starting to get crowded with singular dicks attached to no one. <br />
<br />
Though, in the interest of fairness, Professor Richard (or Teacher Dick, as he had been lovingly nicknamed) couldn&#39;t deny that there was something scientifically challenging happening. He&#39;d only caught a glimpse of it once, when a black student had tried to leave with one of the sample sex toys in his pocket. Before he&#39;d been allowed to intervene, drones had floated down from the ceiling and, in a flash of white light, reduced the student to a black dick on the floor.  <br />
<br />
His colleage, Frank Cage, elbowed him lightly. &quot;Dick, this is what happened to old&#39; Bruce, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, yes, the dean. Currently missing, if police reports could be believed. A mere day after being transformed into his (admittedly very suckable) cock, Bruce Bullheart had stopped reporting for duty in his office. Richard&#39;s own theory was that a student had snapped and decided to use him at their discretion. Bruce hadn&#39;t been well-liked by the student body before revealing his package. <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. Though in Bruce&#39;s case, the transformation had left him outfitted with a drone and some sort of telepathic speaker program.&quot; Which was incredible technology... and it was used by frat bros turning themselves into flying, talking penises. He should not have any faith in humanity to lose after five years as a teacher and yet... <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks fun,&quot; Frank commented, before shrugging and returning backstage with Richard.  <br />
<br />
Now, Frank and Richard had, in the past, experimented. They were researchers at heart, after all. It was a whole facet of male humans interactions that they couldn&#39;t neglect out of some misplaced sentiment of fragile masculinity. Frank was a fine specimen of a man, with deep blue eyes and a short haircut that fit his jetblack hair perfectly. It made him look more severe than his light personality actually was. <br />
<br />
Plus, he was goddamned skilled in the sack. Made Richard see stars in broad daylight. <br />
<br />
Backstage was just the regular area for theater plays and technical teams to assemble the material for shows. In this case, the only real material was a few rotating tables and moving platforms, molded to fit what looked like spheres. Or balls, if one were crude. The actual auctioned people were piled up in a woven basket, shafts over shafts and balls over dickheads. The bottom of the basket looked to be dripping wet, and sticky. <br />
<br />
&quot;And all those students agreed to this?&quot; Richard asked mildly, picking a random penis from the basket. <br />
<br />
Hugo rolled his eyes and went to fetch a remote in the bottom of his backpack. With a theatrical flourish, he pressed the volume button, aiming at the penis in Richard&#39;s hands. &quot;Mason, do you want to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; the cock shouted, &quot;I was reborn ready! Now hurry up with the auction. I&#39;m ready to meet my new owner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A temporary one,&quot; Richard heard himself correct. &quot;Auctions like this have to have set limits for time duration and boundaries far in advance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hard cock softened just enough for the dickhead to droop. &quot;Don&#39;t be a killjoy, Teacher Dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank snorted. Richard rolled his eyes and tossed the prick back with the others. He ignored the &#39;wait, I should have asked him to jerk me off&#39; that arose from Mason&#39;s general direction. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The auction started. The speech sounded rehearsed, textbook-like. Hugo lacked some of the energy needed for this. The topic, luckily, carried people&#39;s interest all on its own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, before we start the official bids, I believe it is tradition for spectators that wish to do so to come on stage and offer themelves in an &#39;amateur&#39; round of bidding. Do any of you wish to be dicked for the sake of being sold for our university&#39;s prestige and funds?&quot; <br />
<br />
A few seconds of awkward silence filled in the auditorium. Richard felt a twinge of pity, despite Hugo&#39;s utterly unaffected expression. <br />
<br />
He felt someone tug on his sleeves. Richard broke away from his staring and looked back to Frank, who was pointing a thumb toward the stage. &quot;It&#39;s for a student&#39;s research grant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard blushed, then pretended he hadn&#39;t. &quot;Truly, Frank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s nothing sadder than a student trying and getting shot down by his peers. We can give people a good example, show them it works,&quot; Frank explained, his smile turning wicked near the end, &quot;plus, we get to try out that dicking technology of his. I know you&#39;ve already formulated two or three theories already. Just try it yourself, you&#39;ll learn a lot faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard sighed, but followed Frank into the spotlight. One of these days, he would have to tell Frank no on something important. Why was he so weak to Frank&#39;s grins? <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we might have some brave volunteers to break the ice,&quot; Hugo said, with not enough emotion to be convincing. He opened his mouth to keep going, but paused when Frank walked up to his podium and started to whisper in his ears. &quot;All they need to do is step into the light and the incredible technical prowesses of our engineering department will do the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank nodded toward the spotlight. <br />
<br />
The lights flashed briefly, and the stinging sensation in his eyes disappeared as fast as it came, overcome by that of freefall. It thankfully didn&#39;t last long, but afterward, he was lying, dazzed, on a pile of clothing more fit for giants. <br />
<br />
He could &#39;see&#39; somehow, and that answered the first of his questions. The first of many. But at least, it gave him a very close shot of Frank&#39;s naked penis, also lying about, but slightly twisted, balls lying on his belt and dickhead buried in a pocket. Dick laughed. Fitting, he thought. Larger balls and longer shaft meant that the center of gravity shifted differently. Stuck the landing. Take that, nine inch cock Frank!<br />
<br />
Gasps and whistling and applause startled Dick out of his contemplations. <br />
<br />
So many students were staring at him, he... he grew hard as rock. It was so improper, but he could not help it. The idea that so many impressionable minds witnessed him in this state of vulgar vulnerability left him afraid he might ejaculate on stage. No. Now, that would be unprofessional, and probably diminish his value if they thought he had a hair-trigger. The experience was simply overwhelmingly sensual, pleasurable in a way that took over one&#39;s mind. <br />
<br />
Dick instead focused on the other sensations. The helplessness that came from a lack of limbs, the phantom feelings of the body he used to have, fading fast. Soon, he theorized, he would have trouble remembering how it felt like to walk instead of lying down. His mind had been relocated in his dickhead, spreading down his shaft towards his balls. A rough approximation of a humanoid shape in theory. But how could he think and still be so sensitive to friction on the flesh of his dickhead? Why could he feel the churning of seed in his balls when a comparable feeling did not exist in human form? His entire self had seemingly been reshaped, compressed, restructuralized internally and externally. To accomplish such a thing in an instant, painlessly and effortlessly was technology beyond anything Richard could have imagined. <br />
<br />
In fact, it did not seem like it could have come from Earth... <br />
<br />
Hugo eyed him curiously. There was nothing unusual about Dick&#39;s dick. He was statistically average for his country and ethnicity. If nothing else, he knew a few biology students could use him as an excellent prop. However, Hugo *looked* intrigued. More so than he warranted, thus the reason had to be something else. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t have deduced Dick&#39;s thoughts, could he? Outrageous, but was it more so than having had his entire self compressed into an innanimate but living and functional penis? His own nonetheless? <br />
<br />
Fascinating. He could not wait to see what he would learn observing this young man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; Frank&#39;s voice arose from his stiff cock, &quot;let&#39;s get this show on the road!&quot;</p>
