<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deciding it might be fun to mess around with the relationships a bit, Jeff made it that Alex would get that chance to be older he clearly was clamoring for... and Sam would get a breather from his hectic on-the-go lifestyle. Alex would become grandpa, and Sam would become his great-grandson via Jeff.  Jeff tried to figure out how to make that work and eventually came up with the following profiles:<br />

Jeff pressed enter and then turned to his screen to watch the transformations taking place.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Alex, felt a chill run down his spine, while the same sensation caused the half-dressed Sam to pause in his change of clothes as well.<br />
<br />
Alex started getting bigger almost immediately. He shot up a foot or two, the towel wrapped around his skinny waist rising from near his ankles to coming just above his knees as he stretched out to 6&#39;3&quot; tall, his feet grew out to monster size 14 feet, and his shoulders and back broadened. He looked perhaps about 15 or 16 years old, and caught in the lanky stage of puberty, but this too departed as next muscle started to come in and grow, and soon he began looking lean and then muscularly lean, and then athletic, and finally well-built. And while his muscles grew, the towel which had preserved the teenager&#39;s modesty as he soared through his late teens could no longer maintain its grip about his v-shaped muscular waist like it could his skinny I-framed one a few moments earlier, and soon Alex was standing naked in the bathroom, the towel at his feet, and his dick and balls having matured to a respectable length and girth--big enough to comfortably fit his large meaty hand around and still have room for it to grow as he became hard. A pubic bush of hair had grown around his developing organ and other body hair suddenly spread across Alex&#39;s frame. <br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s change in his room was just as dramatic a change as his currently undershirt and boxers wearing brother was changing his socks for a fresh pair. Sam at first seemed normal, but then Jeff caught that he seemed to have less body hair and muscles than he&#39;d had a second ago. This thinning out only continued across Sam&#39;s body, making him look less like a college student and more like a twin brother and high school student to Jeff. That twin status however didn&#39;t last long as Sam finished putting his socks on what looked like out of proportioned large feet with hands just as large to match. It wasn&#39;t that his hands had grown, but his limbs had shrunk so much that they looked unbalanced when matched together.<br />
<br />
Alex, at first surprised by his sudden dream of growing bigger and older, quickly turned to shock at the strange feelings he was having from his cock. He wrapped his hand around his shaft and tentatively began to rub and caress it, causing Alex to moan--his voice lowering as stubble appeared over the burgeoning Adams Apple growing in his neck and squaring jaw. Soon Alex had left his teens and looked about Sam&#39;s original age, if not a tad older as he was masturbating. <br />
<br />
Though the socks struggled to stay as taught as Sam had left them as Sam reached for his work pants--his feet showing signs that they were shrinking from their size 13 foot to something a little smaller. This was followed by Sam missing grabbing the pants as his reach shrank along with his shrinking limbs and body. Puberty was undoing itself for Sam rather rapidly and soon both socks were drooping by his ankles and his boxers had fallen to the floor about the time his sleeveless undershirt was large enough to preserve his modesty when they fell. At this point Sam looked more like an innocent twin brother to the boy on the cusp of puberty that Alex had been not too long ago.<br />
<br />
The more he stroked, the more jacked and rugged Alex became. His body thickening with muscle as he shot through his twenties and into his thirties and second puberty started. His abs began to grow a bit soft. Nose hair and ear hair began appearing, a few wrinkles appearing about his eyes and mouth and forehead--and Alex&#39;s proud brown hair was beginning to look thin on top as long strands of it began to fall out. Still, Alex hadn&#39;t yet come to his reward and he kept pumping away into his forties, a goatee forming from all that stubble and soon all the hair on his head being shaved off as Alex seemed to embrace a completely bald look at this age. He looked rather like Dad, Jeff thought, enough to be thought of as a brother to him, but Jeff knew that the transformation wasn&#39;t anywhere near complete.<br />
<br />
Sam however did not stay at the cusp of puberty for very long at it was soon in the rear view mirror as Sam took another hit to his height than he already had and his skinny proportions began to grow chunky with baby fat reappearing as he re-entered the single digits of life. It was about this point that Sam was staring at his hands as he grew smaller, eventually growing small enough that he could no longer stand, and then no longer could sit up. About that point his undershirt fell to the ground and Sam was exposed for the chubby toddler he&#39;d become.<br />
<br />
Gray hair started appearing in Alex&#39;s goatee and at his temples as he met Dad&#39;s age of 49 and then surpassed it into his fifties, his hair becoming far more salt and pepper. It was about here that Alex began putting on the pounds, his belly inflating faster than a balloon before deflating just as quickly as he hit sixty and age spots began appearing on his skin, he began to hunch over (apparently losing a bit of height as he did) and his movements began to grow more feverish as his hair became more salt and less pepper. It was finally as he approached seventy that Alex came, and his dick and balls seemed to shrivel up as they dribbled the cum out of them. The last few years accumulated before there stood, to Jeff&#39;s eyes Grandpa Alex, Mike&#39;s Dad, and the patriarch of the family who apparently now had forgotten his clothes in his room.<br />
<br />
Sam shrank to infancy and soon could no longer sit upright as his age could no longer be counted by years, but by moths, and then weeks, and now only days... 20 days to be exact. Jeff looked at Sam and suddenly felt a pane of worry flood him as seeing the squirming infant in the tangle of clothes he had shrunk with no longer as a brother, but instead as his son... his son who&#39;d been an unexpected joy after last Spring&#39;s Fling Sadie Hawkins Dance. A girl he&#39;d had a crush on had asked him to go with her. He had and before the night was out he&#39;d lost his virginity in the back seat of a car they&#39;d borrowed for the act. They had come to an agreement where they&#39;d take turns looking after little Sam as they were calling him.<br />
<br />
Jeff could no longer take it, and had to get up to get his son. He&#39;d need diapering soon.</p>
