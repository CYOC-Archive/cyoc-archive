**I know Samantha and Frances adopted him after his natural werewolf parents died, but to the best of my knowledge, nobody has established a last name for Ben.—tmw2015</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before the Mayor and Samantha parted company, she hollered "Wait a second Mister Mayor!"<br />
"Yes?" he said, poised to get behind the driver's seat of his car and go back to the Town Hall and prepare. Issuing the WERE Alert was a desperate measure, but one he was prepared to take. Even without another new family poised to move into the Moon Lake community*, he could not allow Yvette to continue running free and risk her changing more innocent normals against their will.<br />
"I almost forgot. I have a message from Eric Anderson for Julie," said Samantha.<br />
The Mayor almost breathed a sigh of relief, for he didn't want to debate the WERE Alert matter any further, with anyone. "It may be a while before I see her. What is it?"<br />
"He said to tell Julie 'Hello', and that he'll do his best to keep his promise to her."<br />
The Mayor thought about it a moment and asked, "Any idea what that last part is about?"<br />
"No idea," admitted Samantha, before they parted company.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Ben Twist** was in Nate Anderson's room helping him with his homework. There were only a few math problems left, which Nate finished quickly and then Ben double checked his work.<br />
"Looks good to me," said Ben, handing Nate back his assignment.<br />
"Thanks. As exciting as being a werewolf is to me, mom's right that I can't let my homework or school slide. But now that it's done, can I ask you for a favor?"<br />
"And that is...?"<br />
"As much as I've wanted to, I haven't had a chance to call Alex all day," said Nate. "Do you mind...?"<br />
"I'll be your wing wolf and wait outside. If you hear me against the door, that means someone's coming. Okay?"<br />
Nate agreed, but as Ben started to leave the room, he said, "You know, while I'm not into guys, I do hope someday to find someone to be as crazy about as you are over him."<br />
"Isn't love grand?" replied Nate in return, before he pushed the button on his cellphone that would automatically call his boyfriend while Ben left the room.<br />
<br />
A couple of anxious rings later, Alex answered his cellphone. "Hello Stud. I was wondering when you'd call."<br />
"It's been more not having the opportunity to do so than not wanting to," admitted Nate. "Besides, I wasn't sure who was supposed to call who first."<br />
"Doesn't matter to me either way, as long as I get to talk to you again. Unfortunately, you picked a bad time," said Alex.<br />
"Oh?" asked Nate, wondering what was up.<br />
"Austin's been calling all the available pack members. City Hall might be issuing a WERE Alert to hunt down that rogue were-vixen of yours," said Alex, before explaining what exactly a WERE Alert was.<br />
"If that happens, shouldn't I stay home and help guard my dad?" asked Nate, not saying anything about overhearing Samantha's call about Yvette having turned another innocent human. "After all, he's the one she's after. And my brother's still normal."<br />
"I admit that makes sense to me, but if the alert's issued, he'll have to go searching for her too and your mom will stay home with your brother. Besides, we have at least another twenty minutes before we find out whether or not we're on. Otherwise, I would love to see you tonight."<br />
"Me too," agreed Nate. "But if it's on this search party, we'll have to be strictly business, especially if we're with my dad."<br />
"I remember. How are things working out on the home front, anyway?" asked Alex.<br />
"Except for their worries concerning Yvette, things seem to be improving, but it will take time to know for sure," admitted Nate. "But even if we don't get together tonight, there will be other times," he promised. The new lovers had a couple of classes AND the Junior lunch period together. Why neither one had not noticed the other before Nate's initiation into werewolf society was a question both boys couldn't answer. But they had met and were in love now, and definitely would make up for lost time as soon as they could.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The object of everyone's mutual hatred was less than a mile from the Anderson family home!<br />
Yvette, now in human form and wearing the clothes that Jenny Harper had on before that fateful camping trip at Moon Lake with Harry Jenkins, was now up a tree in the open forest behind the Anderson homestead.<br />
Being in human form had made the journey slower, but she had double and tripled back on her own trail several times to throw off any would be pursuers. Now, she was staring at the 'bitch' Martha, who was keeping Yvette from 'her' William, through a pair of binoculars that was with Jenny's belongings. The two could be seen doing dishes together through a kitchen window.<br />
<i>Don't worry honey. Soon we'll be together like we should be. We'll run north to Canada and start a family with plenty of kits where no one will ever find us. Including your soon to be ex!</i> Yvette thought happily to herself, while reaching down with her free hand to feel the knife in its belt sheath that was also among Jenny's things.<br />
Yvette was blissfully unaware of the fox hunt that might begin at sundown, let alone how her attempt at obtaining William for herself would turn out.</p>
