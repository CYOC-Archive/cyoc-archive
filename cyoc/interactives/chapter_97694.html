<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William and Martha shared glances to each other as they heard a female voice say &quot;hello&quot; coming from Eric&#39;s phone. A real part of both of them wanted nothing more than to simply mate with each other, and if Eric hand&#39;t come downstairs, Martha realized that they might have actually started having sex right their in their dining room. But Eric had come down with the idea meeting with the Stovalls, likely only Julie and her mother, since the Mayor was likely still at City Hall, and had in a sense caught them. To then try and hide William&#39;s massive erection, she gripped him to her and felt him hold his tail around their waists. Though, at the same time, Martha found herself not being that embarrassed by being naked in front of her son. <br />
<br />
Their transformations didn&#39;t do any real damage to their clothing, as werefoxes and werecats weren&#39;t that much bigger in their animal forms than they were in their human forms. William went from about six feet to six feet seven inches when he took his werefox form while Martha went from five feet seven inches to six feet three inches in her werecat form. It wasn&#39;t too much in the way of height and since foxes and house cats weren&#39;t known great size and strength their muscles might have gained more definition but hadn&#39;t gained much in the way in terms of size. In contrast, Nate and Ben went from around five feet eight inches to being nearly nine feet tall in wolf form. The tips of their triangular ears just barely touched the ceiling and their muscles grew and swelled to match their height and power. As such, Samantha, Frances, Martha, and William could keep their clothing on when they changed but Nate and Ben couldn&#39;t. However, whether or not clothing could handle a were&#39;s transformation was irrelevant to the fact that in the battle with Yvette the werevixen&#39;s claws had cut through their clothing or pulled on material that was still stretched by the earlier transformation.<br />
<br />
And while Martha did feel horny, the mother in her wanted Eric to feel happy and safe, and at the same time, it did make sense to get to know more people in Moon Lake. The town was to be a new start for the Anderson family, and in the time they&#39;d spent so far, they had more than had a new start. They had joined the town&#39;s were-beast society and had many of their issues being healed as a result. But they couldn&#39;t just become hermits with their only contacts in Moon Lake outside of work being the Twists. With that Martha did reach for the phone that Eric held out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Martha said into the phone, &quot;Is this the Julie Stovall Eric has told us so much about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s talked about me?&quot; the voice asked on the other end of the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very complementary of you, I assure you,&quot; Martha said with a smile, &quot;and just asking for some advice regarding some dating ideas and so forth... and with the rogue vixen out of mine and William&#39;s fur, Eric will be safe and the two of you will be free to date as much as you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that is good news, and good that Eric wasn&#39;t harmed,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;though her attack on your home did scare him... and he did call me then... as if to get comfort, and that in turn scared me... I told him never to do that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve done a lot for our son,&quot; William spoke towards the phone, &quot;I think he likes you for that alone... though we can&#39;t tell you everything he likes about you... that&#39;d ruin the fun of being in love.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief silence for a few moments as Julie was likely thinking over William&#39;s remark, though neither of them knew that Julie was giving a bit of a dopey grin and daydreaming about them going down the aisle with Julie in a long white dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Martha then spoke, &quot;Eric says you&#39;re inviting us over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie said after a moment, &quot;you can meet me and my folks and we can have a nice dinner... give you a bit of a break from all the drama that that vixen forced on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha glanced to William and he nodded in agreement. All the drama and the battle had pretty much made sure that neither of them had done anything to get things ready for dinner. It&#39;d either mean a late dinner or having left overs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That actually sounds like a very nice idea,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;Though we&#39;ll need a little time to get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be okay,&quot;Julie answered, &quot;my dad isn&#39;t home yet... so by the time you get here, he should be here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll see you shortly,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Eric waited patiently while his parents went upstairs and cleaned up. He checked the clock on his phone to see that it was eight O-seven when they went upstairs and it was nearly eight thirty when they came back downstairs and in their human forms. William was wearing clothing that was similar to what he normally wore to work, not super formal but more than jeans and a tee-shirt. Martha was similarly dressed in attire that wasn&#39;t super formal but wasn&#39;t jeans or a tee-shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Eric, we&#39;re ready to go,&quot; Martha said with a smile, &quot;Let&#39;s go...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and walked out the door with his parents following. He and Martha paused while William worked the key to lock the front door. The three of them were soon on a calm and leisurely walk along the street that ran in front of their home. Most people had gone back inside and if there was any curiosity at the police and Yvette&#39;s threats was rapidly fading as night was settling on the town. They eventually came up to a home that wasn&#39;t too different from their own in many ways but also had a gate and fence that William and Martha figured probably served to give the Stovall&#39;s privacy. As if they were weremers, they might want the privacy to fully transform and swim if they wanted to.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is their home,&quot; Eric spoke as he reached for the door knocker, &quot;it&#39;s where I went swimming with Julie yesterday...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks nice,&quot; William commented as he looked over the grounds and the home while Eric knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming,&quot; an adult female voice said from inside the house.<br />
<br />
A few moments later a beautiful blond haired woman opened the door. She wore a white blouse that covered her DD cup chest with a knee length skirt that was held on her waist by a jeweled belt. She had a slight hint of fish to her scent, though it was also heavily masked by a perfume that smelled of lavender and various floral scents that smelled nice. Eric realized that this had to be Julie&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, you must be the Andersons,&quot; the woman gave a smile and brushed a strand of hair away from her face and then reached out with one hand, &quot;I&#39;m Melissa Stovall... Julie&#39;s mother. Come in... come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
William shook her hand, and then gestured to Martha and Eric, &quot;This is my wife, Martha, and my son, Eric... who is already familiar with your daughter. And hopefully he&#39;s been respectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I&#39;ve told, he&#39;s been very respectful,&quot; Melissa Stovall smiled, &quot;Come in. Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
They entered quietly into an entryway that a fair number of family pictures going down a hallway. William and Martha looked at the closest one and were actually surprised by how much Julie resembled her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie and I do look a lot alike,&quot; Melissa said to them, &quot;but there is plenty in her that takes after her father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re actually glad that she&#39;s been there for Eric as a friend,&quot; Martha replied, &quot;perhaps more... time will tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Melissa nodded with a smile, &quot;anyway... I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all hungry. Martin got home a little while ago and he and Julie are waiting in the dinning room.&quot;<br />
<br />
William and Martha nodded and let Melissa lead them forward. Eric followed along until they came so that he was between William and Martha. As they eventually came into a central and circular dining room they found Mayor Martin Stovall seated with Julie seated beside him. The scent of a fish casserole also reached Martha and William&#39;s nostrils. It smelled good, though they couldn&#39;t get time to talk on the smell of the food as Julie turned and rushed to hug Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Eric,&quot; Julie said to him, &quot;I&#39;m so glad things turned out okay and that you could come...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... yeah...&quot; Eric answered weakly as he gazed into Julie&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Mayor Martin Stovall said to William and Martha, smiling down as Julie and Eric hugged, &quot;I must say that we sorry for all the mess you&#39;ve had to endure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The way it came about may not have been how we wanted it,&quot; William commented, &quot;but the end results have been quite good. Being a werefox has been healing certain parts of our marriage that was strained...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And being a werecat has helped me with who I am,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;So in the end... we have no complaints.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin Stovall gave a calm smile, &quot;I&#39;m sure... and Ms. Twist has already said as much... but still... we should be responsible. Forcing normals to change... is wrong. It can hurt the psychological make up of the person. It robs them of their choices. And it often gives the rogue sexual attention that they don&#39;t deserve... and it has the potential to expose us as weres and in such a way that we are very much the monsters we&#39;re made out to be in movies and folklore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand,&quot; William commented, &quot;though... there may come a day when we can&#39;t hide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of THAT I&#39;m well aware,&quot; Martin nodded, &quot;but at least with regard to Moon Lake... we want it to come at a point that shows us all in a good light.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the most part you have it,&quot; William told him, &quot;outside of Yvette Smith... everyone&#39;s been respectful to us. The Dean has been friendly to me and even provided some assurance that things here aren&#39;t so bad and that weres aren&#39;t mindless beasts. And the Twists have done much the same for Martha... their son Ben has befriended our older son, Nate, and your daughter has caught Eric&#39;s eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More that he caught hers,&quot; Martin thought and then said aloud, &quot;And hopefully things will go well between them.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then looked down to see Eric helping Julie back into her chair before taking a seat next to her. The two of them were presently conversing over something, though with their focus on Martin&#39;s conversation with them, neither William nor Martha fully knew what Eric and Julie were talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they will,&quot; Martha agreed with a smile. Seeing Eric smile and get along well with Julie made her happy. Eric had always been smart and attentive to his school work and competitive in sports that he participated in, but in many ways was a bit of a loner. He had played soccer and baseball in Minnesota, but outside of games and practices, he hadn&#39;t always done things with his teammates. Martha and William both figured that that had related to the bullying that Eric had endured. But to see Eric smile and have someone that he could connect to personally, it gave her hope that even if Eric remained a normal until he died, he&#39;d at least have the knowledge of friends that cared for him personally.</p>
