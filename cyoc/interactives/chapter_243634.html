<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle mentally prepared himself. He had called his girlfriend Mary, explained everything to her. Ever supportive she agreed to tag along on his trip to see the group of people going through reversion syndrome. He wondered if they knew a way to reverse sooner. He had already finished preparing everything for when his owner takes over. He even did research and found out all the progress he made towards getting his college degree would transfer to her, including credits for a separate degree, incase she didn’t wish to be a programmer like him. All that was left was reversing. As he and Mary stood in front of those double doors to the gathering hall, she clenched his hand, she asked him, “Are you ready?”. He was. <br />
<br />
As they walked in they saw many couples in there. One couple came up to greet them, “Welcome,” the man said, “are you two here for the reversion support group?”. “Yes, we are.” Kyle said, nervousness apparent in his voice. “I’m gonna assume you’re the vagina out of you two,” the woman laughed. “My name is Sue, and this handsome stud is Ryan. We actually already reversed, we just join in the support group to, well, give our support. Remind people it is possible to get what they dream of.” <br />
<br />
“As nice as that is,” Mary began, “you seem to have the wrong idea. Pussy for brains here is the only one reversing. I’m ok being me.” Sue giggled in response, “I see I was right about him being the vagina, you definitely give off the confidence of someone destined to become a cock.”. Mary’s face flushed with red. “H-how dare you! As if I’d ever think about being a big cock.”. “Sue never mentioned a BIG cock.” Ryan laughter heartily, “Maybe you don’t know it yet, but I’ve seen would-be-dicks in denial before. Mine was for a long time too. She gave in and learned to love being my throbbing veiny shaft after a while.”. “Y-you can still communicate with them?” Kyle gulped. “What’s it like for them?”, this time eyes locked on Sue.<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s a case by case basis for most reversions, and it can change over time.” Sue explained, “My pussy, for example, can’t even move on her own. When we first reversed, she could briefly speak to me through our thoughts at first, then I could only sense her emotions, then the only way we could communicate was via her squeezing her walls, then after my 2nd baby, now she no longer moves on her own, she’s become entirely my pussy. I know she’s still there, I can feel it, and I know she will be till the day we die. It’s almost really… sweet, the connection we have.”.<br />
<br />
“Back up… you can get pregnant?”, asked Mary, transfixed on Sue’s groin, a growing hunger in her eyes. “Well of course I can. I’m fully capable at performing everything a woman can do. I’m no different than you. Except I’m not a cock… anymore at least.” Sue said cheekily. Mary once again went beet red, but this time she didn’t protest back. “Matter of fact, it’s a little known fact that reversed pussies don’t feel as much pain as regular vaginas, especially during childbirth. It still hurts but it’s mostly pleasurable. It’s almost guaranteed you’ll experience at least one orgasm per child. Some have even said they’re able to have babies quicker and have better odds of twins or triplets, but I’ve personally never seen it.”<br />
<br />
“So what caused you to wake up?”, Kyle asked excitedly, clearly ready to live the life Sue’s pussy was already experiencing. “That’s the question we get asked the most,” Ryan said, “but just cause it worked for us doesn’t mean it will work for you 4.” Mary, clearly embarrassed, has turned around, pretending to be more interested in a food tray that had been sat out, but clearly still listening closely.  “A common ritual that most people do is to act the part. For pussies this can be simply putting on a nightgown upside down, panties on your face, then putting a dildo in your mouth and sucking until it becomes reflexive. Then your owner should wake up. For cocks,” Mary tried to peer over her shoulder. “Boxers are the only clothes you need, then you just rub your head up and down as if it were a dick, till you hear his voice.”. “But,” Ryan interjected, “only 2 other people we personally know have ever found success with that ritual. If you think it’s worth trying, be our guest. But the only thing that’s proven to work, is just accepting and embracing becoming genitals. The more you become a cock or pussy mentally, the more likely it is your owner will wake up to transform you.”.<br />
<br />
A tad bit disappointed they didn’t have a sure fire way to reverse fast, Kyle and Mary nevertheless thanked the couple, their information had been invaluable. They exchanged numbers to update Sue and Ryan on any progress, then left. On the drive home, they discussed their next move. “So in order to complete our reversing,”, Mary began, “we just need to mentally become the genitals we’re supposed to be? What does that even mean? How can we mentally become a penis? Or-r-r A pussy!”, Mary stammered. “Baby, you can fake it around those two all you want, but they already saw through your not-so-great poker face, what makes you think I wouldn’t either?” Kyle asked. “Ok fine yes, I want to be a cock. But its deeper than that, I just want to be with you and to have a family with you, and it seems like the only way to do that, is to be the cock that’s gonna fuck a baby into you.”. “MARY.”, Kyle shouted in shock. “A baby? I don’t know if I’m ready for all that.”. “You might not get a choice, my owner might use me to pump you full of babies day 1 for all you know. Besides don’t act coy, I can read your ‘poker face’ too. You want to get knocked up. You want to be a pregnant little pussy, stuffed full of cock and cum till your brain melts. I bet you’re curious about those ‘pleasurable births’ Sue mentioned too. What it feels like to push out a baby while you get stretched wide, not having to worry about tearing or bleeding, just getting stretched. Ready for me to pump you full of my next batch of babies so you can do it all over again.” <br />
<br />
It was Kyle’s turn to go beet red. His girlfriend had gotten so graphic so fast. He could tell even she was surprised by what she said, a look on her face as she panted, sweat beading down her head. Thoughts of being inside pussies flooded her head, the idea of pushing against her boyfriend’s cervix and unloading her seed into him got her hot and bothered. Clearly, like him, her fate was to be reversed. At least they wouldn’t have to do it alone.</p>
