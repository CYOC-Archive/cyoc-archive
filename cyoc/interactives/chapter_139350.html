<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Acutely aware of his body, more so than he normally was, Jason tried not to think what had happened and act likely he normally did, but found this to be difficult. Walking downstairs, he noted the way he moved, placed his feet, and held himself, was different and, after walking up and down the stairs, and the upstairs hallway, a couple times, it came to him that it was more feminine, closer to how he thought April and his mom walked, held themselves and placed their feet. His breasts, which he was still trying to wrap his mind around and come to acceptance about having, now had a smidge of weight to them, required him to hold himself differently and seemed to be in the way when he tried to reach forward for stuff, or hold things he took down from a cupboard.<br />
<br />
On top of them being in the way, Jason was also intensely aware of how they felt. He&#39;d never really given much thought about what it would be like to develop breasts, just one or two thoughts every so often that he should have started growing a pair. Yet, now that was, he found himself questioning the idea as the double A cup he had, while feeling nice pressed against the soft cotton top of the dress, were kind of sore and tender, especially around the nipples. A fact that he was consistently reminded of whenever he accidentally misjudged and brushed one of his arms against them as reached for something or pressed the boxed dinner he fetched from a cupboard or the saucepan he took from another too close to his chest. Grumbling, wondering if what he was feeling was normal and if girls actually went through the issues he was having, he squatted down in front of the fridge and cleaned up the raw chicken that looked like an animal had been eating it.<br />
<br />
Upon standing, he became even more aware of his body as he moved over to the trash bin to dispose of the raw meat. It no longer felt, or seemed appropriate, to bend over at the waist and instead a notion of propriety had come over him, which was, among other things, it was right for him to bend over. That doing so might offer a view to any others about things that were best kept secret, among other morals and ideals that Jason found odd on how he was suddenly plagued with what he thought was surely a feminine outlook that April would have been taught, but he hadn&#39;t. Thinking it was odd that his mind was shifting to accommodate his transformation, Jason tried harder not to think about his body, to do as he usually did when he&#39;d been male, but walking over to the stove, he still found it difficult as he started to think about his privates.<br />
<br />
All his life he&#39;d been able to see his penis and testicles, and was aware that these were genitals he&#39;d been born with, and that there was nothing he could do about it, no matter how he&#39;d started to feel recently. Yet, now he was aware that his penis and testicles were gown, replaced by a vulva that he knew existed, as he could feel it and had seen it when looking in the upstairs mirror, but, when he looked down, saw only the two lumps of his chest pushing outward and, when he was able to look past his breasts, nothing but smooth, flat skin. Trying to not let it bother him as he turned on the stove and began preparing his dinner, Jason found himself disturbed by how little he knew about his new set of genitals, such as if he to would one day going to need the padding April used once a month or so, and yet, at the same time, things he knew, like what to do after he took a piss. Mulling over all he did and didn&#39;t know, sometimes drawing information from the little he gotten from health class or from memories he wasn&#39;t sure how he had, Jason was taken by surprise when the back door opened and the familiar voice of Brian state, &quot;Sorry I wasn&#39;t home earlier. My parents insisted I come with them up to the hospital to visit my grandmother, who broke her leg in three places and her hip when she fell over something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not having expected Brian to come over, Jason slowly turned from the stove, waiting for his best friend to comment on the fact that he, Jason, was wearing girl&#39;s clothing. To his surprise, Brian instead exclaimed, &quot;Hey you know you&#39;re phone doesn&#39;t work. I tried to call you twice before I came over,&quot; and sitting down on one of the chairs facing the island, he grinned and said, &quot;Hey, what is it? Wash day or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback, Jason blinked at his friend and wondered if he was having him on. Still blinking, thinking that surely a minute or two had passed, though in actuality it had only been a couple of seconds, Jason finally replied, &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian, making a motion with his hand, explained, &quot;The dress. What&#39;s with the dress,&quot;  and his grin growing wider, he added, &quot;We&#39;ve known each other since, what, we were six or so. And in that time, there has been somethings that never change. You&#39;ve always loved soccer, what you keep calling football, you hate to be called by your first name, Charlotte, and prefer to be addressed by your second middle name, Elizabeth, or sometimes Eli, and that you loath wearing dresses and skirts.&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind struggling to understand what was going on, Jason thought, &quot;Charlotte May Elizabeth,&quot; as a buzzer from the drier sounded from the basement. Unsure who had started the machine, Jason heard himself say, &quot;Yeah, wash day,&quot; and as a dazed feeling settled over him, he asked, &quot;You want something to eat?&quot; to which Brian replied, &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perplexed, wanting to know why his best friend was acting as if nothing was the matter, Jason turned down the heat and quickly exited the kitchen. Heading for the basement, not even paying attention to were he was going, he tried to sort of whether his best mate was playing a joke on him. No longer thinking walking around in girl&#39;s clothing was good thing, chastising himself for not changing before going downstairs to make dinner, Jason shivered as his bare feet touched the cold concrete floor. Hurrying across the basement, thinking that as soon as he changed out of the dress everything would be relatively okay, and he could find out if Brian was joking, Jason pulled open the drier door, intent on finding out who&#39;s laundry was in it. Thinking it was probably April&#39;s stuff as he noted it was all girl&#39;s clothing, he almost shut the door, but stopped and instead reached in and took out a top.<br />
<br />
Alarm rippling through him as he stared at the bikini top he&#39;d been wearing earlier, Jason reached in and began sifting through the clothes before finding the skimpy bottom. Muttering, &quot;What the hell,&quot; he tossed the swimwear back in the drier and sorting through the clothes, he discovered that all of it was the stuff he normally kept in the lock box in his closet, plus a number of other things he was sure he never owned and a couple of things, mostly shirts and his soccer uniforms, that he found a sense of normalcy in. Pulling out everything, he wadded it up into a giant ball and hurried back across the basement.<br />
<br />
As he hurried upstairs, he muttered, &quot;Charlotte May Elizabeth,&quot; and thinking he called out to Brian, &quot;Be right back down,&quot; he hurried up to his room.<br />
<br />
Inside, forgetting to shut the door, he dumped the clothes on his bed and turned to his closet. Opening it, Jason hissed when he saw that the box he normally kept the clothes was gone and that, instead of button-ups, button-downs and men&#39;s slacks, his closet now had dresses, blouses, skirts, nice looking girl&#39;s turtleneck shirts and girl&#39;s slacks hanging up. Closing the door, distraught, wondering if someone was having a go at him, he rushed across his room and began yanking open the drawers of his dresser. Finding only the top drawer had clothes, all girl&#39;s panties, tights and socks, Jason moaned and slowly sank to his bed. Balling up his hands and setting them in his lap, he glanced around his room, which he noted almost looked the same, yet had a slight feminine look to it. Trying to figure out it was that had changed, he eventually stood and no longer liking the dress, thinking he&#39;d only put it on because, as Brian had pointed out, he had nothing clean, Brian reached under his arm and pulled down on the zipper.<br />
<br />
The dress falling to the floor, he stepped away from it and gazed down at his naked female body. Missing what he&#39;d thought about why he&#39;d put on the dress, Jason felt a series of emotions washing over him as he felt upset, confused, tired and, what he thought to be strange, happy. Thinking, &quot;Is my mom and dad going to act the same way as Brian? And what about April? How&#39;ll she react to me like this,&quot; he squatted down, picked up the dress and, after moment&#39;s deliberation, tossed it in the laundry basket in his closet. Turning toward the bed, thinking he had no choice but to wear the girl&#39;s clothes he&#39;d taken from the drier, he was distracted when suddenly his best friend&#39;s voice said, &quot;Hey, I turned off the stove. Whatever you were cooking was starting to,&quot; and turning in the direction, Jason watched as Brian stepped into the doorway, his voice trailing off before into a faint whisper.</p>
