<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Red gazed off into the distance as the love of her life fled for his life (or at least his manhood) and let out a heavy sigh. She&#39;d never find another man as perfect as him. She was pulled away when a proper lavish feast was served, but could barely bring herself to touch it, letting out another heavy sigh. Even when she was brought before the sheik and taken to his bedchamber to be, as he put it, &quot;ravished and deflowered,&quot; while he had her bent over the bed (the sheik himself tastefully just out of frame, of course), she simply propped her head up on the giant pillows and let out yet another heavy sigh.<br />
<br />
Later as she laid awake in bed, mourning the fact that she&#39;d never find another man quite so nervous and out of his element, she caught a glimpse of another man! Nervous and out of his element! Quite the exotic looking fellow too! Rather than another toon, he was flesh and blood. You didn&#39;t see that every day. He&#39;d just ridden across the desert on the back of a camel, and was still there as the camel climbed carefully in through a window and tiptoed across the harem floor. As soon as the intruders caught her eyes, floating in an inky black void as toon eyes tended to do in the dead of night, the camel&#39;s eyes became giant hearts, and he leaned back to start hooting and hollering, but thinking fast the man on his back slapped a hand over his mouth to keep him quiet.<br />
<br />
Red slipped out of bed and zipped over to say hello in a particularly seductive way. The human&#39;s eyes bulged at the sight of her, but in a really subtle understated way, and after stammering something about how gorgeous she was and a nervous glance at the large guard by the door, snoring away and periodically slashing at the air as he had some sort of dream about dicing up intruders, he asked her, &quot;hey, do you want to get out of here?&quot; Red nodded, hopping right up behind him and wrapping her arms around his tough manly chest, and of course bouncing all over as the camel&#39;s humps bobbed up and down on the way back to this handsome stranger&#39;s hotel room not too far away.<br />
<br />
After checking in, paying the camel his cab fair, and having to physically shove him out the door, Red&#39;s rescuer introduced himself as Mark Singer, and started stammering a bit about having seen all her cartoons and being a huge fan. That really got her going. Was there anything sexier than a nervous man so starstruck and intimidating he probably didn&#39;t even know what to do with a woman like Red when they were alone? She seductively planted a finger on his lips, then pulled him in for a kiss and dragged him to the bed. Rather than just ducking down under the covers though, her new man stripped off all his clothes before getting in. ALL his clothes. Even his underwear! Red&#39;s eyes bulged straight out of her head at the sight of his suddenly fully exposed and fully erect dick, zooming straight over so it filled her vision completely.<br />
<br />
It was a funny thing, really. She&#39;d gone to bed with more men than she could count, and that might even have been true if math weren&#39;t such a weak subject for her, but at least as far back as she could remember (the last day and a half if we&#39;re honest, but who&#39;s counting), she couldn&#39;t remember ever actually SEEING a dick before. She knew men had them, she knew every sort of pun and double entendre you could make about them, but the animators were always pretty careful about never actually drawing those. She was positively transfixed by it, Running her hands along it, her tongue, wrapping her breasts around it, and it wasn&#39;t long before it went off all over her, which was also just so incredibly hot and such a novel sexual experience for her. Mark seemed to enjoy all this quite a lot himself, so she just kept at it until he reached his physical limits and then she gave him a cigarette.<br />
<br />
In the morning after they&#39;d taken a shower together and she&#39;d played with that fascinating dick of his again until he was too sore to continue, Mark managed to find the courage to make a really daring proposal. &quot;Hey, so... you are just amazing. You&#39;re everything a guy could ever want in a woman... but, I dunno. It just feels really dangerous here? There&#39;s kidnapping and guys with swords and who knows what else. I know there&#39;s a way for humans who visit here to turn themselves into toons and really blend in, but... that goes both ways, right? I mean, if you&#39;re up to it, would you maybe be willing to get uh... converted over, I guess? And maybe come home with me? I mean, not forever necessarily! But maybe just for a bit of a vacation?&quot;<br />
<br />
Red gave a really seductive smile in return and wrapped herself tight around him. &quot;You had me at &#39;you&#39;re everything a guy could ever want in a woman.&#39; So after stopping home quickly so red could change back into her trademark dress, the two headed straight to the portal area Mark had come in through (and Red too, if you want to be a stickler about that sort of thing), asked around, and found a suitably wild-eyed mad scientist with some sort of ominous metal booth he claimed would transform toons into flesh and blood humans.<br />
<br />
Red was really nervous stepping inside, but the whole process really did seem to work as advertised. It tickled a bit, but gradually her skin took on more shading and highlights, like one of those fancy movie toons, she started to look really 3D like over in CGI town, all her linework gradually faded away, and her skin took on a kind of clammy flabby feel, growing tiny little hairs all over you had to look real close to see. Meanwhile the hair on her head broke out into a bunch of individual thin little strands, and her proportions changed quite a bit. By human standards she was still a total knockout who looked great in a red cocktail dress, but her stomach got big enough to actually house internal organs, her spine reshaped to properly support her in a way that made sense, and her eyes shrank down quite a bit. Eventually the booth made a loud ding, and she stepped out, finding it a little hard to keep her balance on what were still some very extreme heels. Mark seemed absolutely delighted at how she turned out and immediately asked her to follow him through the portal to the normal human world.</p>
