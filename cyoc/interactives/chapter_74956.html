<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hm, these look just like what that jock typically wears. I could attend the party as him. That would be fun.&quot; the nerd says. He pays for the skin suit costume, you. Then he leaves the store. You are completely aware of everything but you have no control. The nerd is in control.<br />
<br />
When the nerd is alone, he says, &quot;I know who you are. It just doesn't make sense for them to make a costume that looks like you. But don't worry. I'm not going to harm you or even keep you. I just want to have some fun with you tonight and maybe a few days afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
He continues to wear you as the hours pass by. You see many places familiar to you and he takes you places that are unfamiliar to you. None of it is noteworthy except the fact that he's taking you and you aren't walking yourself. For example, he takes you to play on one of those dance machine games. With your body, he's a great dancer. <br />
His dancing skill rivals your own and your mouth smiles, although it was the nerd smiling with your mouth.<br />
<br />
Then he had to go to the bathroom and you realize he is using your penis to piss with. The nerd whispers, &quot;I have to admit, you have a large package. I wonder if you can feel your large balls hanging beneath us. And you have a foreskin. It feels different than I thought it would.&quot; You would blush from embarrassment from the nerd talking <br />
about your package that way but apparently, even blushing is in the nerd's control. You can't even blink but he blinks with your eyes.<br />
<br />
You finally get to the party and as you enter, Don says, &quot;Hey Paul, did you forget something? This is a costume party.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd doesn't respond since his name isn't Paul.<br />
<br />
Don gets closer and taps you on the shoulder, &quot;Paul, where's your costume?&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;I am in costume. I came as Paul.&quot;<br />
<br />
Don says, &quot;That's not your usual sense of humor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;I'm not Paul. I came as Paul but I'm not Paul.&quot;<br />
<br />
Don asks, &quot;Who are you then?&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;That's for you to guess. I'll know how good of a costume I have by how long it takes people to guess, if they can even guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Don asks, &quot;You're not some nerd trying to crash our party are you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd spews the drink he just sipped and starts coughing.<br />
<br />
Don says, &quot;Well whatever, Paul, nerd or whoever you are, come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The night continues that way with awkwardness about people asking if you are Paul or not. There is also awkwardness as the nerd says things that would have embarrassed you so it was a good thing the nerd was admitting that he wasn't you. Still, some people wondered if you were just playing some elaborate prank on them.<br />
<br />
You are enjoying the party a little despite the awkwardness. The music is great. All your friends are there and some beautiful women you'd like to get to know. If only you could walk over and say hi to them but the nerd inside you is too shy. So you miss out on some of the greatness of the party but you get to experience the party in a <br />
different way.<br />
<br />
Then you see Kirby there and you wonder who is wearing him since you last saw him at the costume shop. The nerd doesn't realize who Kirby is until someone mentions that at least two people showed up claiming to be wearing themselves as costumes. Then the nerd makes his way over to Kirby and they start talking.<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;Let's find somewhere quiet to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
They find the walk in closet of the master bedroom. It's big enough to almost be a room by itself but it's the only room that doesn't have an occasional person coming in. They wedged the door shut to make sure no one would come in.<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;Okay we know you're not Kirby and I'm not Paul. Do you mind if we exchange our real names and share each other's secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirby says, &quot;Okay, I'm Patricia.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;Patricia, I sit next to you in calculus. I'm Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patricia says, &quot;Oh Rick, I never realized you had such a hot body to go with that brain of yours. I'm getting an erection.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd asks, &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Patricia pulls down her pants and let's Rick see. You find yourself staring at Kirby's big erection. You've seen it before but you've never looked at it the way the nerd is making you look at it now.<br />
<br />
Patricia tempts, &quot;Show me your big cock, big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;I don't know about this. It isn't my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patricia says, &quot;Oh, play along, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel your hands on your hips as the nerd lowers your pants. Then Kirby takes your cock in his hands and starts stroking. Although you feel panicky and want to run away, the nerd inside you is getting turned on.<br />
<br />
The nerd says, &quot;I'm not gay. If it wasn't you, Patricia, I wouldn't be turned on at all. I don't know if I could have sex with you in a man's body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patricia lets go and says, &quot;That's okay. Although I do want to try sex as a man, I don't want to have sex with another man while I'm in a man's body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Patricia took your shirt off of you as she said, &quot;How about just giving me a show. Close your eyes and play with yourself for me. I don't think I could perform with sexually with a woman unless I had a vision of your hot body to fantasize about.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Kirby finds a place to sit and you see him start to play with himself in front of you. Then you close your eyes and realize that Kirby is about to watch you masturbate. You feel your hand on your cock but it is different. You feel your own hand on your cock but it also feels like someone else is masturbating you while you are masturbating <br />
someone else. On top of that, not only do you feel the touch of the hand on the surface of your cock, you also feel a cock inside your cock. You feel violated and turned on at the same time.<br />
<br />
As you are feeling really turned on now, the nerd opens your eyes and you see that Kirby has stood up and has a hungry look on his/her face.</p>
