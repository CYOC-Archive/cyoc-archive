<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You don’t have to take a bath now, but the offer is available for you. I know how you’ve been with this, so I don’t want to make you feel more embarrassed!”<br />
<br />
“Well I don’t want-“ Jacob felt his bladder empty out. Like a loose fireman’s hose, he began to pee everywhere.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Jack quickly grabbed a towel and covered Jacob up. The pee soaked into the towel, leaving the two remaining still with sock and awkwardness.<br />
<br />
Jacob felt so embarrassed when he noticed some pee got on Jack’s shirt. “IamsosorryIdidn’tmeantopeeonyouit’sjustmytoddlerbladderdoesn’ttellmeanythinglikehowitusedto!” Jacob was quickly apologizing as if he’d be killed if he didn’t say it fast enough. Jack got up and began to clean the mess up.<br />
<br />
Jack removed his pee stained shirt and put it with the towel. He placed Jacob in the bath and left the room. Jacob felt guilty, and wasn’t sure if Jack was mad about what he just did.<br />
<br />
Jack returned with a mop and cleaned up the pee on the tile floor. When he finished, he left once more and returned with towels, baby clothes, and shampoo. <br />
<br />
“Well, it looks like we’re going to give you a bath. Can’t have you covered in piss!” Jack turned the water on and put some of the body wash into the water. Bubbles began to form and fill the tub as Jacob stood in the bathtub.<br />
<br />
The bath filled up and Jack began to clean Jacob up. For 10 whole minutes, Jacob felt guilty for what he did as he sat down. Because of him, his best friend’s dad was shirtless and giving him a bath. <br />
<br />
Jacob felt Jack’s big hand scrub through his hair. He then felt the warm water pour over his his head. He closed his eyes to avoid getting soap in them. <br />
<br />
After getting his hair finished, Jacob was lifted up and had the loofa brushed all over his body. From his neck to his toes, he was brushed up multiple times to get the pee off of him.<br />
<br />
When he was finished, Jack unplugged the water stopper and the two watched as the bubbly water went down the drain.<br />
<br />
“Ok bud, we are almost done!” Jack turned the water on and began to give Jacob a shower. He didn’t get his body and hair covered in shampoo this time, it was just a rinse period.<br />
<br />
“Come here Jacob!” Jacob walked over to the edge of the tub. “Close your eyes for me!” He did what he was told and had a wet rag brush over his face. Jacob closed his eyes as best as he could. When he finished, Jacob was able to open his eyes again as the final rinse went over his body. <br />
<br />
The water was turned off and Jacob was wrapped around in a towel. He was lifted and placed on the floor. The tile was cold as he walked across it. Jack led him to his room where he then dried him off.<br />
<br />
He gave Jacob a towel to dry off where he felt wet as the rest of his body was dried off. When the two of them finished, Jacob felt lotion rubbed all over his body. He didn’t like the feeling, but he couldn’t object since he was just a toddler.<br />
<br />
After lotion was applied, Jacob was diapered and then clothed. He was now wearing footed pajamas that was designed with space related things. He knew there was a zipper on his backside, but he didn’t plan on removing his clothes. It made him feel different than what wearing just a diaper did.<br />
<br />
“There we go bud, all done! You’re lucky Greg still had some of his baby pajamas. I can tell that you like the fleece.”<br />
<br />
“Yea it’s soft on my skin. I like it!” Jacob said.<br />
<br />
“Well as long as you keep it clean, you can wear it till tomorrow!” Jack held out his hand and he and Jacob returned to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Jacob was lifted and placed on the sink’s counter. He was told to sit crisscross as Jack began to work on Jacob’s hair.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Greg had the same hair style till they went into middle school. Their hair styles changed each year. When they were three, the two of them had a bowl cut style, but neither of them liked it. The only time they didn’t mind their hair was when it was cut shorter into a scruffy bed head.<br />
<br />
“Let’s fix this wet hair of yours! What you want today?” Jack began to mess with Jacob’s hair, turning it from a Mohawk to a bowl cut, and then put his hair down with a little antenna popping up towards the top back of his head.<br />
<br />
“Look, you’re Alfalfa!” Jack teased. Jacob giggled at his joke. <br />
<br />
Jack messed with his hair again, but this time it became frizzled, like he had just been struck by a lightning bolt. “A little diapered scientist gone mad!” Jack joked.<br />
<br />
This happened for a few more times. Jack would mess with Jacob’s hair and joke about what he looked like. Jacob didn’t mind, and he actually enjoyed someone going through his hair. <br />
<br />
When he finished, Jacob ruffled his hair, “This looks good on me.”<br />
<br />
“You look like you woke up on the wrong side of the crib!”<br />
<br />
The two laughed off their jokes. Jacob’s hair was dry by now, and their laughter can be heard from outside the room.<br />
<br />
“What are you two doing in here?” Dian asked. She was dressed up in a pantsuit, which was nothing like the casual outfit she had before.<br />
<br />
“Oh nothing. Jacob and I were just goofing around! Did you get called into work?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I’ll be home tonight. Remember to take good care of the boys!”<br />
<br />
“I know, I’m not some brand new dad. I’ve done this for years!”<br />
<br />
“Alright! I’ll leave you to it. Be good Jacob!” She walked over and gave him a kiss. She then gave her husband a kiss and walked out of the room. <br />
<br />
“Well buddy, let’s go to the living room so I can keep an eye on Greg.” Jack picked Jacob up and carried him to the living room where Greg was in the same place. The boy hasn’t moved and was still sleeping.<br />
<br />
Jack placed Jacob on the couch and turned the tv on for him. He began to clean up the place while Jacob was distracted.</p>
