<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the day was a blur for Samantha. Dinner at Katie&#39;s and hanging out with her friends passed so quickly that she couldn&#39;t even remember what they talked about. As the sun began to set Samantha and Jacob said their goodbyes and began their journey home. Samantha cuddled up with Jacob as the young teens strolled home. One part of her wanted to savor the romantic walk while the other part wasn&#39;t sure where her new home was.  Finally arriving at their homes the young teens gave eachother a tender kiss before entering their homes.<br />
<br />
As Samantha entered her house she took in her new surroundings. The house was tastefully decorated with pictures of Samantha and her parents decorating the wall. As she made her way upstairs she eventually found her room and loved what she saw. The room was a teenage girls dream adorned with posters, a desk with a new laptop and a large bed. As she examined the room she noticed the window facing Jacobs house, looking out the window her heart skipped a beat. Only twenty feet away was Jacobs room, the boy was now getting ready for bed and turned to see Samantha looking at him. Smiling the boy waved causing Samantha to blush. Samantha returned his wave and smiled before drawing the curtain and laying down on her bed. <br />
<br />
Laying down Samantha now thought about her options. If she stayed 14 her and Jacob word be starting high school in a couple of weeks. The two would end up at the same high school, most likely dating for the next four years. The idea of dating and eventually losing her virginity to her soulmate made the girls cheeks flush. There were downsides to this however, the two would have to build their relationship from the ground up. While the first parts of the relationship were always memorable their would be bumps in the road. Samantha would also lose some of her closest friends. Mary Elsie and Katie would only be ten by tomorrow. While the elderly Samantha could freely go where she wanted the now teenage Samantha would need a reason to make such frequent trips to Mary and Katie&#39;s. Even as the girls babysitter she would not have as much contact with them as she was accustomed too.<br />
<br />
If Samantha became ten though a whole new set of problems would arise. She would be a child with little to no independence from her parents plus any notion of a romantic relationship with Jacob would be over. On the plus side from what Mary Elise had said her and Jacob would be best friends, which made sense since they were next door neighbors. It would make the transition from friends boyfriend and girlfriend easier as they would avoid some of the pitfalls of young love.  As a bonus she would keep her friends. Growing up was always difficult but having true friends always made it easier. These were the thoughts drifting through her mind as she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Waking up in the  morning Samantha went through her usual routine eating her breakfast and taking a shower. As the girl now dressed and brushed her hair she gazed at her appearance. Samantha was still unsure of her decision she had been up late trying to figure it out and still could not come up with an answer. As she gazed at her young teenage appearance with her long brown hair and delicate, innocent features she had no clue what she would tell Katie and Mary Elise when she saw them later in the morning. As she looked out her window Samantha could see Jacob mowing his lawn. Deciding to talk with Jacob before making her decision Samantha threw on her sky blue flip flops and ran outside to talk with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jacob,&quot; Samantha called. Jacob paused  and looked up at Samantha. Wiping his brow the teen smiled and shut off the lawn mower and made his way over to her. &quot;Hey Sammy,&quot; he replied. &quot;Your up early. How everything going?&quot; &quot;Can&#39;t complain,&quot; she replied. &quot;I wanted to thank you again for last night. I had such a wonderful time....can&#39;t wait for us to go out again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob blushed at Samantha&#39;s words and smiled. The teen ran his hands through his dark hair and gazed at Samantha. &quot;I had a great time too Samantha,&quot; he said. &quot;You know it amazing. We&#39;ve lived next door to eachother for years, he&#39;ll we even go to the same school...I&#39;m surprised we never really hung out together before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha paused and looked at Jacob. &quot;We never hung out before  yesterday?&quot; Jacob shook his head. &quot;No not really,&quot; he answered. &quot;I mean we&#39;ve always been friendly but you had your friends and I had mine. I do wonder though what it would of been like if we had been friends before....you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded in response. &quot;If we could do it over again, you know relive our lives and be friends before  being boyfriend and girlfriend,do you think....uh would want to....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled as Samantha struggled to get her sentence out. Placing his hand on her shoulder he looked at her and smiled. &quot;Yeah Sammy, &quot; he said. &quot;I would relive my life again if we could be friends before being a couple. That&#39;s what you wanted to ask right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded and tenderly kissed Jacob on the lips. &quot;Thanks Jake,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a little while. I promised Katie and Mary Elise I would stop by today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled and waved as Samantha skipped down the sidewalk. Her mind made up the girl arrived at Katie and Mary&#39;s and knocked on their door. Katie answered the door still dressed in in pajamas. &quot;Sammy what are you doing here so early,&quot; she asked. &quot;It&#39;s only 8:30 Mary and me weren&#39;t going to change back for a little while longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to wait that long Katie,&quot; Samantha said excitedly. &quot;I made my desicion...I want me and Jake to be ten again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie&#39;s jaw dropped as she stared at Samantha grabbing the girl by the arm she pulled her inside almost causing her flip flops to come off. &quot; are you sure Sammy?&quot; She whispered. &quot;I mean I thought for sure you wouldn&#39;t want to get any younger...you and Jake seem like such a great couple I though for sure you two would stay 14.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled at looked at the bond teen I front of her. &quot;Jake and I are a great couple,&quot; she said. &quot;But in this reality we weren&#39;t friends before we started dating. I don&#39;t want just a boyfriend I want a best friend who I can spend the rest of my life with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded and smiled. &quot;I think Mary is going to be really excited about this&quot; she said. Grabbing Samantha by the arm Katie led her upstairs where Mary Elise was just getting out of the shower. Dressed in a robe the young red head looked surprised as the two ran up the stairs. &quot;Mary hurry up Sammy is going back with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise followed the two girls into her bedroom still shocked by what Katie had said. &quot;Sammy are you serious,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You really want to do this? You want to be a kid again with me, Mika and Katie? But Jake...what about him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake is comfortable with it I asked and no I didn&#39;t tell him about the ring, I just asked if he would of liked if we had been friends before  we dated. He said yes so I&#39;m going through with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Mary Elsie smiled before hugging Samantha. &quot;Sammy this so awesome,&quot; they said. &quot;We&#39;re going to have so much fun together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled weakly. &quot;I know guys but can we get this underway before I lose my nerve. A day or two ago the thought of growing up all over again would of scared me to death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded. &quot;Okay let&#39;s do this. I wish that Mary, Samantha, Jacob, and me were ten again and that everyone except those who already know about the ring would know us  as being ten. I also wish that our parents were four years younger than that reality would know them like that. Finally I wish that our belongings would match our new age of ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha, Mary Elise, and Katie felt the tingle as their bodies began to regress. The girls watched as their teenage features began to shift as they approached childhood. Samantha sighed as she became 13 then 12. Puberty seemed to reverse itself quickly, her hips becoming boyish and her b cup breasts slowly melting away. Samantha watched as she slowly began to shrink in height. As her height diminished she noticed her clothes remained the same size.<br />
<br />
As Sammy turned to Katie and Mary she noticed the two 12 year olds also struggling with their oversized clothes. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I forgot about the clothes we were wearing.&quot;  Samantha smiled as the girls became 11 leaving all signs of puberty behind. The girls shrank again leaving the girls at ten.<br />
<br />
The girls looked at eachother and hugged. &quot;Welcome to the club Sammy,&quot; Mary Elise said. Sammy smiled. &quot;Thanks girls, now can we get some clothes that fit I have to get home.&quot; Katie grinned and in only a moment the girls clothing once again fit. Sammy thanked the girls and ran for the door. &quot;Katie, Mary we&#39;ll talk later right now I need to see my best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Running as fast as she could in her flip flops Samantha stopped in front of jakes house. Jake was  now ten and continuing to do yard work. Although her romantic feelings were now gone Sammy still found Jake to be quite cute for a boy of ten. Jake saw Sammy and ran up to the girl with a smile on his face. &quot;Hey Sammy,&quot; he said excitedly. &quot;Hey Jake,&quot; she replied with a smile. &quot;How&#39;s the yard work going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake smiled and glanced around the yard. &quot;I just finished up. My dad just set up the sprinkler to water the lawn. You wanna go run through it together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled as she kicked off her flip flops and began to run barefoot through the grass. &quot;Last one there is a rotten egg!&quot; She exclaimed. The two best friends played in the late morning sun laughing and playing as best friends do. Finally collapsing in the grass from exhaustion Sammy looked at her best friend and realized she had made the right decision.</p>
