<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the Charlestons were finished with dinner and cleaned up the kitchen, Karen retired to her bedroom.  She opened up the book on her bed, but paused as she thought to herself.  She didn&#39;t quite remember leaving the book where it was, or on that page.  But she simply shrugged as she casually flipped through the pages.  She glanced through the pages, her eyes focusing on the various pictures.  She glanced longer at the feline weres, and the males in particular.  She stopped at a picture of a male werecougar, and studied the picture.  Her finger traced the muscles on the werecougar&#39;s body.  Her finger stopped briefly on his crotch as her mind started to imagine what would it be like.<br />
<br />
Karen wasn&#39;t exactly the innocent little girl that her parents thought she was.  True, she was a virgin now, but she had a couple of close calls.  Nichole had her on birth control pills ever since she was 13, and this somehow empowered Karen to do things a little risque.  The closest she&#39;s come to full-on sex was when she was almost 15, and her boyfriend at the time got a little hot with her.  He had her shirt up and he was sucking on her breasts.  Karen could feel her nipples stiffen as she remembered that experience.  However, before the two of them could have gone any further, they were interrupted by somebody.  After that, Marco entered into her life, and she&#39;d been on the run ever since.  A part of her wondered how it would have felt if the two of them continued.<br />
<br />
Karen felt that the room was a bit too stuffy for her, so she went to the window to let some fresh air in.  It was night at Moon Lake, and the cool September air flowed into her room.  Although it was pretty dark outside, she could see the trees and the lake in the moonlight.  Her mind drifted to her decision to become the family were.  Mostly, she volunteered because she was tired of running.  Ever since Marco and the Gamboni&#39;s came into her life, it was completely chaotic.  Just once, she wanted to live a normal life of a teenager, and not be at the mercy of some lecherous older guy who just wanted some tail.  As she learned more about the town weres, she couldn&#39;t help but admire them a bit.  While they didn&#39;t quite fit into her imagination, it still impressed her.  Karen stood in front of a mirror as she imagined herself as a weretigress.  She tried to imagine herself with striped fur running down her arms and back with a white underbelly covering her front.  She also tried to imagine herself as a werecougar with the tan fur and the various forms of coloration all over her body.  At least according to her imagination, she&#39;d look sexy as either, and she still hasn&#39;t seen a wereleopard or a werelion.<br />
<br />
With her window open, Karen could hear all sorts of sounds coming in from Moon Lake.  She could hear the wind blowing, the crickets chirping, howls, growls, and roars.  Was Moon Lake always this noisy at night?  Her eyes focused on some movement in their backyard near the tree line.  She couldn&#39;t tell for certain, but judging by the way their bodies moved, they were definitely felines although she couldn&#39;t tell what type, and by the shape, male and female.  The two of them stopped just past the tree line.  Karen turned off her light so she could see them better.  They were far enough away that Karen still couldn&#39;t tell what type of were they were, but she could see their movements as the two stopped to make out with each other.  The two paused to have a conversation, which Karen was able to listen to through her open window.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t thank you enough for turning me,&quot; the female voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my pleasure.  In more ways than one.&quot; the male voice responded.  &quot;How did your parents take your entrance into wereleopard society.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; the female voice trailed, &quot;they were a little disappointed that I didn&#39;t go werewolf like they did, but as long as I&#39;m happy, they could accept it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you have younger siblings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and they were born after mom and dad turned.  So, they&#39;ll be werewolves too when they get old enough.&quot;  Karen watched as the female were pushed the male were down.  &quot;But enough about them.  I&#39;ve got this itch I need to scratch.  And there&#39;s this perfect scratching post right there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By all means, dear,&quot; the male voice responded, &quot;If you need it, go at it.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s eyes widened as she watched the female were climb on top of the male were and straddle him.  Although she couldn&#39;t see details in the low light, she could definitely see their movements as the female were slowly lowered herself onto the male were only to be followed by a slow movement up.  The female were continued this movement for several minutes before speeding up slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gawd,&quot; the female voice called out while she moved, &quot;I needed this for a long time,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and me both,&quot; the male voice responded between grunts.  Soon both of their vocalizations were replaced by moans and growls.  Decency required that Karen close the window and the blinds, but all she could do was watch as the female were bounced on her male partner.  She could feel her heart racing as she was breathing hard.  Was she being turned on by this?<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before the moans and growls increased in frequency and pitch as the two of them reached orgasm.  Karen absently massaged her breast as she felt the nipple hardened under her nightshirt.  The moans and growls reached a crescendo as the female were gave a gasp and stopped moving for a moment before collapsing down on her partner.  It was at that point that Karen could finally move and she closed the blinds to her window without closing the window herself.  She went into the covers of her bed as she thought about what she saw.  Why couldn&#39;t she move?  Why is she so turned on right now?  Has she become some sort of voyeur?<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Karen, one of the weres saw her and just gave a smirk.</p>
