<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a long time, Jeff thought to himself, wondering about the power that the Chronovac had. The mention of a werewolf was definitely interesting and piqued his overall curiosity since he, himself, was a lover of all things werewolf. Ever since his first watch of &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; Jeff was enthralled and obsessed with the idea of becoming a werewolf... a monster... to just go about killing and slaughtering whatever was in your path with indiscrimination. From there, Jeff went on to find all of the werewolf monster movies that he could including titles like &quot;The Howling&quot;. The one thing that Jeff was irritated by was that after the early 90s, there really wasn&#39;t anything good out there. He wished there was and every time the word &quot;werewolf&quot; popped up in his feed... he gained a spark of hope that eventually died as the majority of things that came out overall just sucked. There were a few properties here and there that Jeff did enjoy, that definitely had merit, but those were also lackluster while being hard to come by as they were few and far between... especially in a small town like Jeff lived in. He grinned a wicked grin as a wry thought entered his mind, making him wonder what it would be like to be a werewolf there... have its way with all of the people and just indiscriminately slaughter the entirety of the town. No one would have been the wiser... it would have just looked like an attack from a pack of massive wolves... as the authorities wouldn&#39;t think it was just one humanoid wolf on a killing spree. There&#39;s no way that the dumb police around there would even know and the werewolf would end up either making a pack of certain folks in the town or they would all just be fodder for slaughtering like humans did with animals for food... either way it would be a ton of fun to watch play out.<br />
<br />
With the idea building in his mind, solidifying in the basics, but flourishing in the details, Jeff made the ultimate decision and started playing around with the parameters within the Chronovac. Since he was already in the &quot;Fall Into The Story&quot; category, Jeff left that as it was. From there, Jeff looked at all of the various options that existed and smiled as they fit into exactly what kind of story he was about to create and make a reality.<br />
<br />
The first option was an either/or, which was  or , which Jeff chose the first... he definitely didn&#39;t want things to get out of hand after all.<br />
<br />
The second option was also another either/or, which was  or , which Jeff again decided the first as a werewolf being made in their town seemed interesting enough... being born that way and going to a small, quiet town to escape and do as they pleased sounded far more appealing.<br />
<br />
The third option, once again, was either/or, which was  or . This time Jeff picked the second or latter choice just because he wasn&#39;t very much of a fan of a feral werewolf... it just seemed too alien to him and at the same time... it was easy to dismiss as a wild animal. No... if this was going to be a monster slasher horror flick... it needed to sell that. An anthropomorphic werewolf was FAR more appealing than a plain old, albeit larger than normal, wolf.<br />
<br />
The fourth prompt was a series of options that were needed to be picked out, which Jeff chose: Horror> Monster, then another option popped up for the type, which was: Monster>Werewolf. After that more options appeared, which were: Gore/Blood>Yes, Violence>Extreme. After that one final option popped up: Do you want the possibility of becoming the monster? From the options, he picked: Yes, eventually or immediately.<br />
<br />
With everything entered, Jeff hit the &quot;Accept&quot; button which then submitted all of the options chosen, and simultaneously the Chronovac in his hands disappeared. However, before that, a message appeared stating, &quot;Parameters entered require lengthy allowance. The scenario will commence for an indefinite period until desired story parameters are met and options will become available to make things permanent or otherwise. All of it made Jeff grin, thinking it was the magic of the device making sure the scenario had to be played out until its end... if there even was an end. Now... all Jeff had to do was to wait and see what occurred. Jeff was eager for anything, especially since he knew he was a part of the story... just unsure of how much of part of a story and it was uncertain how long the simulation had to last. What didn&#39;t really occur to him is what monster werewolves being unleashed on the rest of the world meant, but at the same time... Jeff didn&#39;t care. He wanted the world to be more interesting. He loved werewolves being monsters and felt that was what was exactly needed. He didn&#39;t care who got hurt in the process or anything of the sort. Jeff just wanted to be a werewolf and see what life was like with werewolves in the world was.</p>
