<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three moved carefully around the maze, trying their best to avoid the others, remembering the witches words. They were also careful of where they stepped, knowing that traps existed all around the maze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any thoughts about where any of those orbs might be?&quot; Robin asked.<br />
<br />
Jake sighed, frustration already beginning to wear at his patience. &quot;It&#39;s been an hour and I don&#39;t even remember how we got here, let alone where to go.&quot; Jake replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez, no need to get all snappy with me bro.&quot; Robin said, just as tired as Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jake apologised, &quot;but it&#39;s not like I would have any understanding of any of what&#39;s going on. Especially not that.&quot; He cried, gesturing to the 10 feet of bull meat behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... big now.&quot; The Minotaur (formerly known as Helena) commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That you are.&quot; Jake replied tiredly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there has to be a method somewhere in this madness.&quot; Robin mumbled back.<br />
<br />
Jake breathed in sharply, ducking back suddenly into the bush. Startled, Robin asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing her by the arm, he pulled her back behind the bush. &quot;Quiet,&quot; he whispered, slowly turning his head to peak past the leaves.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Is there another person there?&quot; Robin whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you notice any changes?&quot; Robin asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Not physically.&quot; Jake replied, &quot;But as the witch said, the changes don&#39;t need to be physical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what should be do?&quot; Robin asked, trying to keep as quiet as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More... people!&quot; The Minotaur suddenly bellowed as he began to walk forward.<br />
<br />
Evidently, this startled the group ahead, as the immediately began to run for their lives. Unfortunately, this only led them to their doom, as darts shot out from the ground, hitting all of them. They all collapsed, seemingly lifeless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, don&#39;t go that way.&quot; Jake commented, slightly sarcastic.<br />
<br />
As he turned to start leaving, Robin pulled him back down, &quot;Hold on Jake, there&#39;s something there.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they poked their head into the bush, there came a glow. With all the foliage it was only faint, but it was there nonetheless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Robin declared.<br />
<br />
After taking a moment to regain his composure, he spoke &quot;Ok, but we need to be careful. Helena-&quot;<br />
<br />
As he looked back, the bull-man was nowhere to be seen. Turning back past the bush, he saw Helena walking off towards the downed men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for fu- HELENA!&quot; Jake cried as he leapt up and gave chase, Robin close behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Men... not dead.&quot; The Minotaur stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jake asked as he caught up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Men...not... dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, Jake took a moment to look at the men more closely. Indeed, they were not dead. In fact he could see their bodies twitching. <br />
<br />
And then pulsing.<br />
<br />
His blood running slightly colder, he turned the Minotaur and said, &quot;We&#39;ll be behind you. Make sure you don&#39;t leave our sight.<br />
<br />
The minotaur nodded as they begun to move forward. As they moved closer the pulsing of the men, hearing bone grind against bone as the men began to shake.<br />
<br />
However, it was only when they moved past the men that the true changes began. The men all let out a desperate cry, a song of anguish as their forms began to shift.<br />
<br />
The minotaur turned, seemingly tranfixed on the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Robin asked, beginning to panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Was his only reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go.&quot; She demanded, grabbing hold of his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not leaving Helena behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not leaving Helena behind.&quot; Jake repeated.<br />
<br />
By now, flesh and bone pulsed wildly as their forms began to restructure themselves. The men pulled at their clothes in a mad frenzy until nothing was left Bit by bit, the torsos of each of the men cracked inward until they became more light and dainty.<br />
<br />
What was lost on top piled up on the bottom, densy muscles eaten away by soft, round fat. Thighs bulged as calves and feet compressed, becoming softer and more womanly. Their asses filled out quickly, turning from flat and muscular to round and plump.<br />
<br />
Arms compressed as the finger became slender and fingernails grew. Then the hair grew. As they grew they split into fine philaments. The hair was becoming feathers, the arms becoming wings.<br />
<br />
Next was the chest. The areola began to widen, then the nipple. The once small dots, stiffened and fattened into peaks. Then fat surged forth into their chests, the flat pecs softening into luscious peak. One of them stopped at a B-cup, another stopped at C, but the last kept growing until it reached DD.<br />
<br />
As their breasts grew, their cocks shrank, losing their shapes until all that was left was the small nub of a clit. Their testicles pulled into them as the empty scrotum split and shrank into the labia. The hips creaked, widening further to allow for their new organs to take roost.<br />
<br />
With each moan brought about by the transformation, the pitch of their voices heighted until they were those of a woman. Their neck shrank becoming slender as their Adam&#39;s apples melted in to the rest of the throat.<br />
<br />
Finally was the heads. The hair of each &quot;man&quot; began to lengthen to varying degrees. One only had slightly lengthened hair, another&#39;s lengthened until it reached the shoulders, and the last lengthened until the hair reached the mid back.<br />
<br />
The heads began to crack and pulse, compressing to match the rest of the body. The faces crack and morphed, the jawline softening as the cheek bones raised. The noses shrank as the lips grew large and kissable and the eyes became large and alluring.<br />
<br />
Their was a final chorus of moans, seeming to derive from pleasure, in contrast to the painful screams that began this display.<br />
<br />
For a moment the men, now turned into harpy women slumped lifeless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it over?&quot; Robin asked, horror clear upon her face.<br />
<br />
As it reacting to the comment, all of their eyes opened as they began to rise. They stretched, displaying themselves in all their newfound glory to the world.<br />
<br />
It seemed that the hair was inversely proportional to the breasts, as the short haired harpy had the largest breast, and vice versa for the long haired harpy.<br />
<br />
Jake gently grabbed onto The Minotaur&#39;s bulky arm, &quot;We need to go.&quot; Jake pleaded, shaking the arm.<br />
<br />
The Minotaur did not respond.<br />
<br />
After a moment to collect themselves, the harpies slowly turned to the group. In particular, their attention had been drawn to Jake.<br />
<br />
Their expressions slowly turned from blank to lusty, sinister smiles, as the short haired harpy spoke for the first time, &quot;Man... meat...&quot; she said as she licked her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit.&quot; Jake whispered to himself, feeling frozen in terror.</p>
