<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was standing leaning against a large Maple tree there in the near to center of the parking lot. It was about 10 pm, and Jack with Liam were walking in my direction. I felt a want to be near the boys, it was an evil sort of desire, gay and bestial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you again,&quot; I said as my greetings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Toby, he went along with you,&quot; Jack asked, &quot;Is he still having trouble with what you did to change him?&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled at the thought of Toby and how I left him, he sheath deep and mating a nanny goat, and Toby becoming more a goat as he stood there humping a horny female. &quot;Nah, Toby had a change of mind about having such a big package. We talked some about it and I helped him change, the last I saw of him he was busily fucking a horny female he just met!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toby, fucking a woman, like for real, you ain&#39;t joking?&quot; Liam asked, he by then had come close enough to where my demonic-animal-magnetism was giving him a boner. Jack was following slightly behind Liam, his physical body acting like an insulator, blocking my sexual magnetism. As he came to stand then along side Liam, Jack&#39;s penis sprung to attention, it tenting his pants front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell&#39;s bells there man, what is it about when I get near to you my penis gets a boner?&quot; Jack asked of me, and his question caused me to then laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ever hear of animal-magnetism, well I radiate it!&quot; I said, as that was close to being true for them to understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad says his stud Rottweiler sire makes the bitch get all horny when he comes near to one; to see that big brute stand up and ram his cock inside a bitch, the bitch yelps real loud. Yet dad&#39;s pedigree bitch died shortly after she had her last litter. My Dad was hoping to find a new bitch, a younger one, in hope she would bear four or five litters; that is one way our family makes a living, as dad sells each pup for $800.&quot; Jack said, as Liam stood nearby but acted as if quite disinterested about the breeding of dogs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Liam, do you know that hot dog place over on Brad Street, if I give you ten bucks, would you go there and bring back some hot dogs; oh and smother them with onions, mustard and ketchup.&quot; I asked of a nervous Liam. He was quite happy to take my ten spot and took off at a fast run across the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Jack then looked at his watch, seeing it was almost 11 pm. &quot;Liam won&#39;t get there in time, the hot dog stand closes up around 11:30!&quot; Jack mentioned to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw..., too bad, well let me ask you a question about your dad. How much would he pay to get a two year old pedigree bitch for use as a breeder?&quot; I asked Jack as he looked at me with eyes wide as if he found something like what I proposed his dad, he would be very proud of his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, but where can you get such an expensive dog like that around here? My dad paid a thousand dollars for the last bitch, he might pay even more concerning his need is urgent.&quot; Jack said, as I stood there with a smirk across my face and staring heavenward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know of somebody who would love to help your dad get his prize winning Rottweiler bitch. She is not far from here, hey, let me leave Liam a note where to find us, and we can leave right now.&quot; I said, as had a neat thought how to make a quick buck and still ride the neighborhood of another gang member.<br />
<br />
I wrote a short note telling Liam to meet me at Jack&#39;s family apartment.<br />
<br />
As Jack walked along beside me he kept trying to press down his stiff boner. He saw me smile a couple times before he said, &quot;Hey, for whatever reason I keep having a real boner problem when around near you, it ain&#39;t so funny. Hell, I hate it so much I wish I had a cunt!&quot;<br />
<br />
We had not walked another city block and Jack had his/her cunt. He was so busy telling about his fun adventure when stealing at the food mart, that he failed to take note his pants were not tented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was some adventure, would you like to try a real sex crazy venture, something where you like Toby could get some hot sex?&quot; I asked Jack, as his eyes lighted up and he stopped walking, as stood there with a devilish smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take that smile to mean you are of interest to my idea.&quot; I said, as Jack still smiled with his evil grin. &quot;OK, first we need to get you a costume to wear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A costume, at eleven at night, you going to steal it?&quot; Jack asked, he ignoring that the costume was for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your right, it is late, but if you trust me and my magical magnetism, I might change what you wear to make do.&quot; I suggested, and the sexual radiant waves coming off me engulfed Jack with ideas of fornication. &quot;Come here into the alley, I can make it happen if I put my mind to the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and I entered the dark and steamy alley, there was no security lights to tell what was to happen. &quot;Now then, take off your shoes and socks, let fall down your pants too. Yea OK, stand real still. Close your eyes, as hold your breath, make no movements until I say it is safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack was one willing as foolish teenager boob. He followed my desires to the tee, as I thought about how good Jack would feel when he became a Rottweiler bitch. As my scheme built with power, I added instinctive suggestion to the changing brain of one teenage boy becoming a bitch dog. Jack moaned as with his eyes held closed he felt his internal organs changing, becoming female and canine. I did to him what Runt had done to me the night we first met, only I shaped Jack&#39;s head to resemble that of a dog. <br />
<br />
Oh how Jack stood there relishing his sensations of skin changing, fur sprouting, and her docked tail growing out three inches above her anus and cunt. Tough body muscles reinforced the bitch dog torso as eight teats adorned the tummy of Jack. He was by then a she but did not understand how he was becoming a she and a dog all in one. Jack was thin before he began to change, as so it made his legs and arms becoming dog legs all the easier. As his fingers became dog paws something in him made Jack want to open his eyes, as he seeing his costume, thought I was a great magician.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me Jack, Jack look at me, OK, remember this and do not fight it. I have made you  a Rottweiler bitch of a dog!<br />
Your becoming a dog is a great adventure, remember that! You disliked how your cock felt and wished you had a cunt instead; well now you have a cunt and you like the idea! You like your cunt, its sexy, and especially you like it because your tongue can lick at it! You wanted to impress your dad and help your family make more money, and as a bitch dog you will be of great help! One thing more, as you learn how to live like a dog, your intellect will fade, as fade until only your doggy thoughts shall remain.&quot; I said, doing my best to insert a hypnotic trance into Jack before I sell him to his dad.<br />
<br />
A wishing of my left hand and in my grasp were pedigree papers showing Princess Jacqueline the Rottweiler bitch as the daughter of a great prize winning set of parents. Jack&#39;s father met me at his front door about midnight while flaunting at me his hand gun. We had a deal and he paid me $1,200.00 taking hold of his new dog, he let his stud sire get a sniff of one weeping nervous cunt.</p>
