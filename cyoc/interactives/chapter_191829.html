<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But first…<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“So what, we just stay here till tomorrow? And go to sleep pretending people growing animal tails all of a sudden isn’t completely fucking insane??” Danny raved on, having gotten all the more indignant towards his peers and faculty as the night carried on. <br />
<br />
He was beginning to feel alone in his apprehension, as many of the people around him were acting almost suspiciously accepting of the impossible situation that had unfolded in such an uncomfortably short period of time. Well, perhaps “accepting” wasn’t the right word, but people were turning into animals. And having sex without any concern for privacy. And they were out in the middle of the woods without any real means of contact with the outside world. It had far surpassed the realm of what could be considered normal in Danny’s eyes, and he felt like he should be running down the halls screaming bloody murder.<br />
<br />
The only person he could confide in was his older brother, who laid on a bed in front of him, right arm covering his eyes and trying to sniffle a bad cold away. He had been feeling unwell ever since that morning, and as a result he had hardly paid attention to what was going on around him. He did know about the transformation and the sex however, but he, maybe due to his sickly state, thought his brother was overreacting.<br />
<br />
“Ughh...I don’ know…nguhh...[Possum]-bly?” Rudy spoke, nasal congestion and an overly salivated mouth blending the letters to his words.<br />
<br />
“Possibly? You know for it to be ‘possibly’ this all would have to actually be ‘possible’! This stuff shouldn’t happen, Rudy!” <br />
<br />
“Well it’s happenin’...Gotta accept it.” Rudy spoke with a bit of pause to his speech.<br />
<br />
<br />
Danny Capano had never been that big on football. He wasn’t really built for it, honestly, with a thinner build and slightly less than average height. He actually didn’t care much for sports in general. He did, however, care about his brother, and only joined as a way to spend more time with him before they would both head off to different colleges right after graduation. Rudy was always bad about staying in contact with people outside of the daily, real-life interactions — he just couldn’t remember to make it a priority — and thus Danny was afraid they’d grow apart over time: realistically, their relationship was already starting to diminish. The two brown-haired, brown-eyed brothers were so close as younger kids, but it seemed like, in the last few years, Rudy was just never in the mood to even chat.<br />
<br />
“...But...this isn’t just...we can’t...this is so fucked…” Danny looked defeated, not even getting the support he wanted from the only person he even had a strong connection to in this place. “Rudy, I know you&#39;re sick, but…”<br />
<br />
“But…?” Rudy responded, a clear annoyance in his tone.<br />
<br />
“We’re still normal, but things won’t stay that way if we stay here...around all these people that have...whatever it is that’s changing them.”<br />
<br />
Danny had come up with his own theory that the cabin’s curse was like a disease, being transmitted from one person to the next in their sexual interactions. He had gotten a glimpse of the bj’s on the bus, but wasn’t aware of the masturbation that had already doomed so many others. Somehow it was more believable to him with a sort of sci-fi explanation as opposed to a magical one.<br />
<br />
“Uh-...Uhuh…” Rudy sputtered out, trying to hold in a cough.<br />
<br />
“I’m saying...” Danny sat on the edge of the bed beside his older brother, who was still laying down. “...that we can’t get back on the bus with them...we’re going to have to find our own way out of here.”<br />
<br />
“Are you complete-...completel-...” Rudy sneezed a violent sneeze, which surprisingly seemed to invigorate him, his voice clearing a little. He then sat back up. “What are you thinking!? We’re going to go out in the woods and just...hope we make it?”<br />
<br />
“We have no other options! None! Anything else you’re thinking is wrong, okay?Getting on that bus is a death sentence. Staying here is a death sentence.”<br />
<br />
“We can’t. We just can’t.”<br />
<br />
“We have to.”<br />
<br />
“Well I won’t.”<br />
<br />
Danny stood back up, dejected. He looked straight into Rudy’s eyes with a sorrowful expression. It wasn’t just about the cabin and the curse; it felt like a reminder that his brother didn’t care about him. Rudy applied to a different college when Danny said he got accepted to the one he was interested in. He suddenly joined football right when Danny had started hanging out with him after school. And now this, he didn’t have his back when he was clearly feeling emotionally distraught and filled with anxiety. <br />
<br />
“...Fine. But tomorrow, I’m going. You’ve got twice the amount of camping experience as I do, but I’ll do it alone if that’s what it takes.” Danny said, turning away.<br />
<br />
“...Ughh...Danny, I-”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the two heard a knocking on the door. The two looked at each other in confusion for a brief moment until they replied in unison, “Come in.”<br />
<br />
The door timidly opened, revealing a small, very pale-skinned, brunette girl.<br />
<br />
“Uhh, hi, is Rudy here?” the girl questioned, cautiously and quietly. Danny stepped aside, and Rudy peered out.<br />
<br />
“Uhuh.” he said, motioning a hand up as if to further say ‘present’.<br />
<br />
“H-Hey! I um...heard you were sick so I wanted to check on you. I asked around and someone said they saw you head in here.” the girl piped up a bit, and, being able to actually hear her voice, Rudy finally recognized her.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Holly!...Hah...didn’t actually know you were on the other bus.”<br />
<br />
Holly Pines gave a soft smile. She had only recently transferred to Washington high and Rudy was one of the few people that actually tried to interact with her since she arrived. She was a friendly girl usually, but it was a bit more difficult when she didn’t know anyone, and thus she came off as shy and quiet. Rudy liked that about her, however, and it had led to an unspoken interest between the two of them.<br />
<br />
“Yeah...I’m not sure if anyone really did...nearly got trampled on the way out…” There was a brief moment of awkward silence before Holly continued. “But anyways...how are you holding up? Do I need to perform a thorough examination on you?”<br />
<br />
Holly was already studying to become a general practitioner, as both her parents were doctors. In reality, she wanted to be a zoologist; ironic, given the situation. <br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh, no no...I’m doing fine. Just tired.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah right! You’re as sick as a [dog].” Danny chimed in, disapprovingly. <br />
<br />
Holly looked at him, a bit shocked, as did Rudy. He had kept pretty quiet all night and had only said a few words to Rudy before going on his rant in the bedroom moments prior. As a result, he hadn’t named an animal, despite not purposefully trying to avoid it.<br />
<br />
“Danny...you really should be careful with your idioms right now.” Holly said.<br />
<br />
“What? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” Danny asked, frowning. It was another detail he missed when half listening to people discuss this curse.<br />
<br />
“Nevermind...” Holly was a bit taken aback by his stern demeanor, and thus decided not to further explain her meaning. <br />
<br />
“Don’t mind Danny, he’s just a bit...freaked out...right n-” Rudy tried to defend, before sneezing and then coughing.<br />
<br />
“As I sure as shit should be. The reality we all know and love just said ‘fuck it’ and started turning inside out!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you told me-…” Rudy reminded him, before coughing once more. Holly could tell Danny was in a lot of stress and it wasn’t helping Rudy’s health. She took a seat beside Rudy — his feverish symptoms coming back after the last sneeze.<br />
<br />
“Um, Danny, could you do me a favor?...Rudy could probably use some water — it’s important to stay hydrated when sick — and...well...you should probably have some too, just to be safe. I saw a kitchen while I was walking around, there should be cups there.”<br />
<br />
“I...” Danny, feeling alone once again, decided to just drop it, as it wouldn’t be a winning battle. He sighed, giving a feeble “Fine...whatever.” before turning back to the door and leaving.<br />
<br />
Once he was out of earshot, Holly expressed her concern. “He hasn’t...changed at all yet, has he?”<br />
<br />
“Nope...not as far as I know...heh, hope he doesn’t turn into a dog though...might just fit him a bit too much.” Rudy said. He did love his brother, but he felt Danny had gotten too clingy over the years, as though he spent more time trying to impress Rudy than figure out his own life, and focus on his own needs. <br />
<br />
Holly gave a soft chuckle. Rudy had talked to her about Danny on a number of occasions, and as a result she had formed her own opinion on him: it wasn’t entirely positive.<br />
<br />
“Well I sure hope not, then we really wouldn’t get along, if you want to believe the stereotype.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm? What do you mean?” asked Rudy.<br />
<br />
“...Back on the bus, we were getting bored so a girl started talking to me. We ended up talking about our pets and I told her I have a cat, soo...yeah.” Holly responded.<br />
<br />
“Oh...gotcha.” Rudy replied, not really sure how to feel or react. <br />
<br />
“...It’s uh...not entirely true, by the way. About cats and dogs? A lot of them get along pretty well, they just tend to have very different personalities.” Holly informed, always happy to share her knowledge about animals. Rudy didn’t respond, however, so after a bit more awkward silence, she continued. “Um, so what about you? Are you still ‘safe’?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah. Haven’t been talking much tonight. I don’t think I’ve even had the opportunity.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good.” Holly smiled, sweetly. “Well I hope you feel better soon. I’m here to help.”<br />
<br />
Rudy smiled back. “Well...I do appreciate having someone so nice to talk to. You’re good company.” <br />
<br />
Holly took a seat next to him. She didn’t really see him outside of school, and they were usually surrounded by people, but this was a calm moment of silence in solitude: for right now, it was just the two of them in this weird situation, and he was like a candle in the dark. The only one who she knew. The only one that cared.<br />
<br />
“You know, if it wasn’t for the circumstances, this would be a nice getaway from normal life...”<br />
<br />
“Yeah...honestly it’s a good break. And I can’t think of someone who deserves it more than you.”<br />
<br />
Holly scooted closer. “And I can’t think of someone better to spend it with than you…” She looked into his eyes, once again featuring that loving smile. Rudy looked back into hers, a blush now forming on his cheeks. <br />
<br />
It started with a bashful kiss. Neither young adult was sure if it was the right thing to do, but they couldn’t resist any longer. They wanted each other. They needed each other.<br />
<br />
The kiss grew more heated when they both realized it was really happening. So much pent up emotion gushed out in the form of a very physical communication. Their lips osculated to an unheard rhythm, his hands brushing down her neck, causing a shiver down her spine. Her hand reached down the front of her skirt, as romance began turning into libidinous desire, her own fingers caressing her needy slit.<br />
<br />
Rudy sat up more profoundly, relishing the sweet cherry flavored lipstick she often wore. One hand trailed down her back, while the other skimmed the outline of her breasts through the top she wore so elegantly. An obvious erection grew from his pants, as the kissing became more and more intense, <br />
<br />
Then the changes started. As Holly played more with herself, a cat tail grew from her spine. With each rub it got longer and longer, fur growing in, black all around, and white at the tip and the underside of its base. It snaked out from under her skirt, whipping from side to side as it surged past a foot, to two feet, and then to three. <br />
<br />
Holly took her hand from her clit and placed it daintily on Rudy’s groin, teasing his cock through the fabric. She looked back into his eyes for a brief moment, before moving closer into his arms, head laying against his shoulder while her fingers drew over his genitalia with even more fervor. <br />
<br />
A hairless tail began creeping out the back of his pants, not as animated as Holly’s, but still just as surreal. His hands, now holding her in a sweet embrace, again trailed further down her spine, further and further, until it should have stopped, but didn’t. <br />
<br />
Rudy’s eyes widened, as he felt the sensation of delicate fur underneath his palms. Curious and confused, he wrapped his hands around the furry appendage, with it swinging about in his grasp.<br />
<br />
“Uh...H-Holly.”<br />
<br />
Holly gasped. Cat tails were sensitive, especially where Rudy was holding hers. It was the most astonishing feeling she had ever experienced, and the greatest pleasure too.<br />
<br />
Enough to send her over the edge, she orgasmed with a restrained “Mrrrow!”<br />
<br />
Rudy did not. The brief glimpse back into reality was enough to hold him off, even if it wasn’t intentional. For his sake and his sake alone, it was the luckiest of timing, as their lustful activities would delve no further — not when Danny stood in the doorway, two cups of water in hand, and a look of shame on his face. Rudy stared back at him, while a satisfied Holly still lay against his chest.<br />
<br />
“...Fuck it...Fuck you...guess I’m leaving alone after all.” Danny said. His shame had turned into anger, and he stormed off dropping the water at his feet. <br />
<br />
“Danny, wait!” Rudy respectfully moved Holly to the side as he got up to go after Danny. She watched him leave, as the world returned to her, and saw his tail begin to withdraw. She looked down at her own body, realizing what had transpired, and that she was now left with herself to deal with it.<br />
<br />
Danny ignored his older brother’s calls and dipped into a room of his own, shutting the door behind him. <br />
<br />
He felt defeated. Getting out might not even be worth it, or the right thing to do, if he had to leave his brother to rot. He thought that he’d still be able to convince him the following day, but not it probably didn’t matter; he was infected — changed — in his eyes.<br />
<br />
But that feeling of defeat wasn’t the only thing making him uncomfortable. It was hard to deny that watching the two lovebirds go at it got him excited. It was a bit awkward seeing his own brother in such a position, but Holly on the other hand had given him quite a show. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t right. It wasn’t normal. Danny was one of the few boys in school that actually was legitimately and entirely gay, even though most people didn’t know it. He’d never been attracted to women, not even a little, but seeing Holly enjoying herself — the way that tail moved — invigorated him. Every guy he’d ever had a crush on turned out to be straight; he wondered if he’d just been so deprived for so long that his mind gave up on being picky. He wanted to be loved. He wanted someone to say he belonged with them. Maybe he was simply jealous of what he saw, and it translated into lust — a lustful desire to be a part of something special.<br />
<br />
Regardless, he was definitely very horny. He sat down, a little cautiously, sighing and trying to focus on something else to keep his sexually addled mind at bay. He thought about the football team, the cabin, the forest. He wondered if he might just be overreacting; everyone would probably get back home tomorrow and they’d be able to get help and figure this thing out. Even if his brother was a strange freak of nature now, he was still normal, so perhaps it wasn’t he who should have been freaking out. <br />
<br />
His mind continued to wander, but his thoughts kept devolving into sexual desire. He knew he wouldn’t be able to hold out, and soon enough, he gave in. He wasn’t worried, as he believed he wasn’t “infected” and thus a little self pleasure couldn’t hurt. <br />
<br />
If only he was right. If only it wasn’t an inescapable curse, he’d be fine. <br />
<br />
He sighed once more, before pulling his pants down just far enough to free his cock from its confines. He started stroking it, doing the same. His cock grew all the more erect in his palms, as his fantasy suitor touched himself teasingly.<br />
<br />
It felt so good, almost unbearably so, that he didn’t notice the tail growing from his backside, growing thick, fluffy fur as it extended more every second. A deep frustration within his mind began to resurface. It was unrealistic, with the way things had always been, that the man in his vision would care for him. They were always straight. <br />
<br />
He remembered Holly, how happy she looked. He wanted that. He wanted a man to caress him, hold him, stroke her tail.<br />
<br />
It was at that last thought that Danny came. White, sticky fluids covered his pants in a blast of pure ecstasy. He felt calm now, at rest and less worried. This was at least something familiar — normal. <br />
<br />
It was normal until he heard tapping behind him, and a sensation he was unaccustomed to. He turned his head and peered out of the corner of his eye to see what was producing the strange noise, and that’s when a severe feeling of dread hit him, and the tapping stopped. <br />
<br />
Behind him was a large German Shepherd tail, attached to his body, entirely his. He wasn’t surprised, or even shocked, it just felt like a tragedy. After a long time sitting in  thoughtless anguish, Danny got back to his feet, pulling his trousers up for what would only be a short while. He began searching the room for something better to hide his new tail.<br />
<br />
There was one thing he knew for certain.<br />
<br />
Rudy couldn’t know.</p>
