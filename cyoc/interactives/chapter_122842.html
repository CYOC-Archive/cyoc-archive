<br />
&quot;Your chicken fried steak okay Eric?&quot; asked his father.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s delicious. Don&#39;t know why you didn&#39;t order one too instead of that double cheeseburger and fries.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what I felt like,&quot; replied William Anderson, looking at his son.<br />
After collecting Eric from school and getting his broken nose treated, the two went back to Moon Lake High only long enough for Eric to find out that Principal Andrews dismissed him for the rest of the day.*<br />
That didn&#39;t excuse Eric from his homework though, as evident by the collection of books in the trunk of the Anderson family&#39;s car.<br />
Complaining about missing lunch and being hungry, his father decided to treat Eric to a late meal at The Local Diner, instead of going home and trying to rustle something up there.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Poe?&quot; Eric asked, trying to find something to talk about.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Besides wanting to broaden my horizons and teaching base, did you know that Edgar Allan Poe is accredited with creating what we know today as the mystery genre**?&quot; replied William.<br />
Eric, between mouthfuls of food, simply nodded his head.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Forgot who I was talking to for a second there,&quot; said his father with a sigh.<br />
&quot;Dad...&quot; began Eric, after taking a sip of milk. &quot;I may be way smarter than a kid my age should be, but I&#39;m still you&#39;re son.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know Eric,&quot; replied William. &quot;Going from Freshman last year to Senior this year. Sometimes it surprises me how intelligent you really are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Eric asked in disbelief. &quot;It was a shock to me too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really, and I know I should of told you before the new school year started, but somehow I never got a chance. Anyway, I did better in school than your older brother Nate is right now. Probably would have done even better if I thought more with this,&quot; said his father, pointing to the brain in his head, &quot;than this,&quot; he added, pointing down toward the space in-between his legs. &quot;Once I met your mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then William Anderson paused and cleared his throat before saying, &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean I ain&#39;t proud of you or your accomplishments.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sometimes I wish Nate applied himself more,&quot; confessed Eric, &quot;but his lawn care and landscaping business has promise, and Nate&#39;s in a great relationship with Jean Talbot,&quot; he added, referring to the fact that the two of them already had their were-wedding as far as the laws of nature were concerned, and would be legally married as far as the rest of the world was concerned after Nate graduated high school next Spring.<br />
&quot;Yeah. She&#39;s a great match for him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, and Jean&#39;s studying to be a lawyer. They make good money.&quot;<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t about that Eric. The foundation for any real and long lasting relationship is love. Me and your mom. You and your ladies. Nate and Jean. The Twists...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, but what I meant was that Nate&#39;s lawn care service is seasonal at best. With Jean as an additional breadwinner, they will at least always have a dependable income,&quot; explained Eric.<br />
&quot;While a steady job is needed for a continued existence, it&#39;s also a question of what you do for a living. As long as it&#39;s honest work, your mom and I won&#39;t be saying much about whatever you boys choose for your future careers, but I would like to point out that there&#39;s an old adage that says <i>Do what you love and love what you do.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is why Nate&#39;s doing yards and you and mom both teach,&quot; realized Eric.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; confirmed his father. &quot;But my professional life aside, I always have and always will love your mother. It happened the moment I first set eyes upon her, and it won&#39;t stop even long after I draw my last breath. And that was before we both became werefoxes and the vulpine life/soul mate bond between us was established.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Eric, thinking about how he felt toward Spencer and Frieda.<br />
<br />
Then William Anderson paused for a moment and said, &quot;Speaking about great catches...&quot;<br />
&quot;Me and Spencer and Frieda,&quot; replied Eric, knowing what was on his father&#39;s mind.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Now, I know how it all came about,&quot; said William, recalling past events in their lives, &quot;but just between the two of us, did you and Spencer plan to...&quot;<br />
&quot;Other than having Frieda make me a werepanther so I could be with Spencer since, being a hybrid, she was afraid of what might happen if Spencer tried to induct me into were society herself, the rest is a total but wonderful surprise to all three of us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I remember. Spencer&#39;s dad is a full blooded werewolf, but her mom&#39;s a werecat/werepanther mix.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. As much as Spencer wanted the honor of ushering me into were society,&quot; <i>and taking my virginity,</i> Eric silently added, &quot;I might have become a werewolf, a werepanther, a hybrid like Spencer, or a werecat. That last part scared her the most, because Spencer didn&#39;t want me to become either bi or outright gay in the process.&quot;***<br />
&quot;You know we would have accepted you, no matter what kind of were you wanted to become or how things turned out.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
They ate a little more before Eric said, &quot;Dad. I know our relationship might seem a bit odd to some people, but I really do love both Spencer and Frieda, and they love both me and each other in return. It wasn&#39;t planned, but we&#39;re happy. It&#39;s kind of like you and mom and your open marriage arrangement,&quot; he added, referring to the fact that Martha Anderson was bi and often shared the women she beded with her husband. &quot;Although all we&#39;ve had so far is just our were-wedding until after everyone graduates high school, the only difference between your marriage and mine is the fact that we have a very tight, closed and select group.&quot;<br />
&quot;That and the Skulk life/soul mate bond your mother and I have, with both of us being werefoxes,&quot; pointed out William. <i>But did Martha and I ever have a true were-wedding? Or was our already being married it when that werevixen inducted both of us the same night?</i> he silently wondered.<br />
&quot;Our bond is just as strong,&quot; said Eric. &quot;Truthfully? Sometimes it&#39;s a little scary too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said William, staring at his son. &quot;How so?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong. The part about each of us sharing our orgasms with each other is truly sensational,&quot; said Eric with a smile, to which his father simply nodded and smiled too. &quot;Why all our eyes changed color to this unique shade of green even when we&#39;re in our human forms, let alone why only the combined scent of all three of us aroused and in our fursonas makes such a powerful aphrodisiac for other weres are mysteries I intend to solve one day.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, that unique scent is only present when all three of you are together, furry and aroused?&quot; asked William.<br />
&quot;Yep. All three of us horny but still in our human forms doesn&#39;t do it either.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know it drives your mother and I crazy whenever you three have been at it or are about to have sex together, but that unique scent doesn&#39;t work on normal humans?&quot; wondered his father.<br />
&quot;You know, we&#39;ve never been around any normal humans when furry and aroused, so we have no way of knowing how one would react. The only reactions we&#39;ve ever seen have been in other weres. I know Frieda&#39;s mother, trying to be all prim and proper, isn&#39;t too happy about it at times, but we&#39;ve never heard her father complain about the end results,&quot; said Eric, before winking at his dad.<br />
&quot;If it does affect them, just don&#39;t turn any normal into a were against their will. You certainly don&#39;t want to risk violating Statute 1A and winding up in prison like Julie Stovall did.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Eric. &quot;But this morning, when Frieda and Spencer were suddenly there by my side in my moment of need, that surprised the heck out of me,&quot; he confessed.<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked his father.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong. Between our bonds and our mutual love for each other, I will always have their backs and they&#39;ll have mine, but to see them just suddenly standing there next to me...&quot;<br />
&quot;Surprised you, huh?&quot;<br />
Eric just shook his head affirmatively. &quot;In a good way,&quot; he added, &quot;but yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
William Anderson stared at his son a moment, as if contemplating something.<br />
Then he said, &quot;Speaking of confessions. If I tell you something, do you promise just to keep it between the two of us. Never to tell another soul, not even Frieda and Spencer?&quot; asked his father.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Eric, not mentioning there might be a chance of his ladies figuring it out through their emphatic link.<br />
William looked around, to make sure they would not be overheard in the back of the diner where they were sitting, then revealed, &quot;I&#39;m a little jealous of you Eric.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
His father shook his head affirmatively. &quot;Long before we moved to Moon Lake, let alone became Skulk members and that strengthened the already existing bonds of love between us, your mother and I talked from time to time about maybe establishing a permanent threesome and forming a polygamy relationship of our own, like you have with Spencer and Frieda.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Eric in disbelief.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. Remember, your mother embraced her bi side long before we first met back in college. We certainly have had a lot of fun over the years, especially after we joined were society. Anyway, even after we got married, we discussed the possibility of being man-wife-and whatever you would call the other lady, but we never could find that <i>special someone</i> who would be willing to become an exclusive partner to both of us, let alone someone we could both agree on.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what the official title for the third person is, regardless of gender,&quot; admitted Eric. &quot;In our case, I think of both Spencer and Frieda as my wife and they both consider themselves Mrs. Anderson. Yet Frieda also thinks of herself as Mrs. Lawson, and Spencer also thinks of herself as Mrs. Knight. Not sure that will ever be considered legal, despite the eyes of nature seeming to have accepted it because of having our were-wedding. So as far as the world&#39;s concerned, we&#39;ve already decided when we&#39;re old enough, I&#39;ll formally propose and Spencer will officially become Mrs. Eric Anderson, with Frieda as her Maid of Honor. Then the three of us will all live under the same roof and share the same bedroom, regardless of what each girl decides to call herself too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve just about got everything figured out,&quot; realized his dad.<br />
&quot;So, you would have made your relationship totally exclusive, just like Spencer, Frieda, and I are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, having more than one partner. I come by it naturally,&quot; realized Eric. &quot;You and mom and whoever. Nate, Jean, and that lady she was seeing before Jean fell in love with Nate, who he has sometimes also.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep. Moving to Moon Lake and becoming weres opened up a whole new world for all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric stopped and thought about it for a moment.<br />
Then he said, &quot;Dad, if you and mom ever did find that lady now, how would it work out between you three, let alone dealing with Nate and me?&quot;<br />
William Anderson thought about it for a moment and said, &quot;Truthfully? I honestly don&#39;t know. But the other woman would have absolutely nothing to do with you and Nate. Besides, your mom hasn&#39;t brought the subject up in years. That ship sailed away long before we moved to Moon Lake and is just water under the bridge now.&quot;<br />
<i>I wonder... If mom and dad found and fell in love with a normal woman they agreed upon who was willing to enter a polygamist relationship with them, would she form a life/soul mate bond with both of them if mom and dad teamed up to make her a werevixen?</i><br />
<br />
Eric started thinking about the possible scenarios and odds of that situation working out to everyone&#39;s satisfaction.<br />
His father, knowing that faraway look on his son&#39;s face, said, &quot;What are you thinking about now, son?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Err... nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on Eric. I know you too well. You can tell me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Eric, then he said, &quot;Now that the problem with &#39;Piggy&#39; Wilson is over,&quot; while briefly touching his bandaged nose to see how sore it still was, &quot;There&#39;s this other issue at school with these three were-elephants who call themselves The Tusk Brigade. At the very least, they&#39;re expecting all three of us to kowtow to them and me to do all their homework for them so they pass and graduate this year.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bullies, huh?&quot; said William, not realizing what Eric actually was thinking about. &quot;You&#39;ve dealt with them before back in Minnesota.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. But it wasn&#39;t much fun then, and that was before we moved here, let alone before I had to start thinking about Spencer and Frieda&#39;s safety; besides it being before I accidentally killed a man...&quot; said Eric, looking down at his food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son,&quot; said his father, reaching across the table to gently raise Eric&#39;s head up by pushing under his chin. &quot;You know a bully is just a strong idiot who thinks might makes right.&quot;<br />
&quot;True. But I also know what might happen if I cut loose like I did before.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eric. They&#39;re tough, but you&#39;re tougher. Here,&quot; said William, pointing at his son&#39;s brain, &quot;and here,&quot; he added, pointing at Eric&#39;s heart. &quot;Whatever happens, you know we&#39;ll stand by you, and so will Spencer, Frieda, and their families too.&quot;<br />
&quot;And Spencer and Frieda are part of my family now, besides me still being a part of yours,&quot; added Eric.<br />
&quot;My boy is growing up,&quot; said William Anderson proudly, while smiling at him.<br />
After the waitress came and left the check, William said, &quot;Eric, there is one thing that I will need your help with before this day is over.&quot;<br />
&quot;All you have to do is ask dad,&quot; he replied, as they got up to leave.<br />
&quot;What are we going to tell your mother about how your day went once she finds out?&quot;<br />
