<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James woke up to the sound of his phone getting a text message, and while its a little awkward to roll over to reach it with your belly swollen like it is you manage to open it.<br />
<br />
It was a message from his dad that read: &quot;Doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll have time to sort this out before the wedding, I noticed you were gone when Rachel called so you may as well stay there for now. Its fine, I&#39;ll try to cover for you. Try to figure something out before we get back, that should take a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled at the idea that his dad would have to make excuses why he&#39;d not there for his aunt to glare at. He had no idea if his aunt would be happy at that or not.<br />
<br />
Stretching out, she noticed the other two had already gotten up, and having only her in there really emphasised how much bigger this room was than the rest of the house now. She had noticed the extra closets, and she guessed two of the closets now there were probably for her new partners. Another thing was a large full body mirror in the corner of the room, just wider than the length of her own, and about as tall as the room.<br />
<br />
She moved over to a dresser attached to one of the closets and saw her name engraved into a plate on the front. Opening the first draw turned out to have a variety of panties and boyshorts with a hole for her tail in them on one side, while the other side seemed to be mostly sports bras. Looking at them, they didn&#39;t seem that feminine, in fact they might have just been her old underwear refitted for the new body.<br />
<br />
She took a plain looking pair of black boyshorts in one claw and held it underneath her body, poking her tail through the provided hole so she could hold it open and slip her legs into it at the same time. The matching bra was slightly easier given it seemed to be made to slip on so long as she could fit her wings into the back holes. It just meant she had to do it one foreleg at a time.<br />
<br />
The musing on her clothes being refitted turned out to be pretty accurate when she found a shirt she recognized to put on, a bright blue one with a red stripe down one side. As she put it on, it was clear that it was made to hug a girl&#39;s body now, as it felt snug against her. It even seemed to have a bit of elasticity around the belly given her little bulge.<br />
<br />
James moved over to the mirror and looked at herself all dressed up. With her boyshorts hiding the slit for her penis, and not having an erection or anything right now, she couldn&#39;t notice any signs that she had anything male down there; making her rub the cloth held tight against her crotch just to double check it was there. It took a moment for her to realized that her clothes were probably huge, given that being on all fours as she was, she&#39;d still be eye level with a lot of tall humans, and most others would probably come up to her chin.<br />
<br />
 The egg belly made her wonder how many months along she&#39;d look in human terms... Probably three or four, five tops... Soon she was reminded of how she started thinking of herself as a girl after she realized she had a vagina, and how eager Alex was to have her vagina filled once she actually had a vagina... The magic that was now part of her was the reason she saw herself like this... As a girl... Because that&#39;s what she needed to see herself as to allow herself to be mated... By herself.<br />
<br />
She shook off the thought, as much this magic had changed what she saw herself as, she still had roughly the same personality, as did Alex and Rachel... Love charm not withstanding, given it made her as much in love with them as it made them fall in love with her.<br />
<br />
She started to eye over her own reflection in the mirror for a moment, starting to wonder if the magic was going to make her fall in love with herself... She shook off the thought, she had other things she could be doing, and she was already tapped for sex right now. She&#39;d eventually need to find a way to contain her influence if she wanted to live a semi-normal life, and even then she&#39;d still have to figure out how to make the rest of the world deal with her being like this.<br />
<br />
She scanned around the rest of the room, and noticed a bookshelf, apparently filled with a number of old fashioned looking books. A couple of ones that stuck out were &#39;spells for beginners&#39; and &#39;one hundred and one practical spells for mythical creatures&#39;, the latter of which seemed like she&#39;d need to spend some time with soon.<br />
<br />
Her exploration of her new room was interrupted by the smell of breakfast, and she followed the smell downstairs, past the door at the bottom that seemed to be in the same place as where the door to her old room was, and down the next set of stairs towards the main living room area, with a sort of kitchenette off to the side.<br />
<br />
James looked over and saw Alex making what appeared to be bacon and eggs, making her raise an eyebrow as Alex gave her a look. &quot;The irony isn&#39;t lost on me, but I got these eggs from the fridge,&quot; Alex said.<br />
<br />
Looking over, James saw her fridge must have been huge now, probably to deal with the added family members that they&#39;d have to feed now, but also to deal with how big dragons are.<br />
<br />
As Alex set out a plate for James, she noticed that Alex&#39;s claws were a bit blackened. &quot;You&#39;re not hurt are you?&quot; James asked. <br />
<br />
Alex wiped off most of the char onto a hand towel on the edge of the table. &quot;Not really, I think we&#39;re pretty much immune to fire now... It just... Gets everywhere... It was a bit worse when I tried to see if I could light the stove with my own fire breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
James blinked a few times, wondering why she hadn&#39;t tried doing that herself. Then again, there isn&#39;t really many times where setting things on fire is that useful unless you want to cook something or destroy something... And she didn&#39;t exactly want to burn her own house down.<br />
<br />
Rather than sitting in a chair, James sat on her haunches; hoping that so long as she was sitting she wouldn&#39;t have problems using both foreclaws to handle her food. Alex wrapped her forelegs  around James&#39; belly, and stroked her egg bump. &quot;It would be nice to believe that I sired these ones inside you... But something tells me that&#39;s not the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
James nuzzled Alex. &quot;You still ended up getting to make love to me as both a man and a woman... That&#39;s not something many can claim.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two&#39;s giggling was interrupted by the bell of a passing bicycle, and as it went past, James suddenly felt worried. &quot;I don&#39;t think its a good idea to leave the window blinds up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook her head. &quot;Closest I&#39;ve seen to someone actually paying attention were some girl scouts who came to sell cookies... I mean, they noticed Rachel and I were dragons, but... I don&#39;t know, maybe the magic we&#39;re giving off is making them rationalize away why they shouldn&#39;t make a big deal about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of Rachel,&quot; James said, &quot;where is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex pointed towards the back end of the house. &quot;Trying to explain the situation to some of our other friends... She figured using skype would be more convincing.&quot;<br />
<br />
James sighed. &quot;Between that and the girl scouts, its almost like you two wouldn&#39;t cause any problems going outside to shop or work... But I&#39;m stuck here unless I want to turn the entire town into my personal lovers... I sound like a housewife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame really,&quot; Alex said, &quot;we could have shown you off to people, and nobody would have known you were a guy. You don&#39;t even have a bulge unless you try to bring your dick out of your slit on purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
James felt Alex&#39;s tail tip teasing at the inside of her underwear, teasing the vent her penis was stored in and making her feel erect somewhere inside herself, but she didn&#39;t feel it pushing out just yet.<br />
<br />
James took a sip of a glass of milk that was presented, only to gulp it down greedily, capping it off with a bit of an excited whine. &quot;This is your own milk isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nods, her hands trailing up James&#39; chest as she lifts the shirt and bra up to expose James&#39; own teats. Before James even knows what&#39;s happening, she&#39;s been pushed only her back, with Rachel returning to join Alex, both snaking their necks toward James&#39; breasts, lapping at the little dribble of milk coming out. James&#39; back arching as the two latch on properly, wriggling even as their own swollen egg filled bellies press against hers.<br />
<br />
Then she feels something deep inside her shifting about, like something hard is trying to stretch her cervix. &quot;Guys, I think I&#39;m laying!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two giggle around her nipples, their tails pulling James&#39; boyshorts down around her knees before intertwining their tails to push into her tunnel, making her squirm even as they massage her looser around the egg, getting the tips of their tails behind the egg as if trying to grasp and pull at it. James herself feeling contractions starting as it starts to get pulled out of her, feeling no pain, as it goes, no different from any other act of sex, her fluids leaking over her thighs as it starts to reach her entrance. With her legs spread wide, Rachel and Alex yank the egg out of James&#39; pussy, leaving it nestled between her thighs and tail. <br />
 <br />
James finds herself panting as they draw back from her breasts, licking their lips at how her milk tastes. &quot;Am I... The first of us to lay an egg?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel giggles. &quot;No, we both laid one each while you were napping. We put them inside a hidden compartment under the mattress. Its warm in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
James nodded, looking down at her egg, at least as wide as a baseball, and longer by half. It seemed like such a delicate thing to come from her body, but she felt something... Pride and... Something in the back of her mind told her that her being the sire for dragonkind was going to be just as true for any future dragons... And children she fathered or mothered... She would end up their lover as well.<br />
<br />
She felt a need to hold the slickened egg closer, and as she felt her lovers placing her underwear back on, Rachel had a mischievous smirk as she slipped the egg between James&#39; breasts right before they slipped her bra back over her breasts.<br />
<br />
Once again, James found herself curling up with her lovers as she took a nap in the afterglow. Smiling.</p>
