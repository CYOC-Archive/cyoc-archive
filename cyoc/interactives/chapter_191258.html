<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s Note: Thanks to RealityChange for the use of his OC candy and Knick-Knack loving witch involved in this chapter. Happy Halloween, everyone!<br />
<br />
Once again the Hallowed evening had come upon them, Selicia had planned to use the evening to take stock of local prospects. Of course, this holiday was more focused on the youth of the populace... Those would be given token treats and sent on their way... Have to give them the time to appropriately ripen after all. However the elder ones~ Maybe even the parental figures might be -persuaded- to elicit services from herself~ Based primarily on the amusement they might provide her and so, that is how Selicia found herself at the gate of her home this evening.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d decided on taking up the garb of a common caricature of a witch of this era. Of course, she&#39;d put her natural spin on the ensemble; a black dress appearing tattered at the thighs, black cat thigh high stockings, shined black leather buckled slip-on shoes, oversized crooked cone hat with floppy brim, and a thick gnarled broom stick. Abhorring the use of make-up for herself, she instead magically accentuated her lips deepening their color and fullness as her eyes sparkled more than usual. Even wearing the costume, she&#39;d felt more comfortable than she&#39;d considered. A witch being more akin to an alchemist or a shaman than a full fledged mage like herself...<br />
<br />
Putting her bias aside she&#39;d focused on her task at hand entertaining passerby. Of course, she allowed the overly giddy Marina and the dutiful Lisa to handle the younger crowd. The pair had taken the more traditional French style maid uniform but, with Black Cat accessories added at Marina&#39;s request. Ears, tail, paw gloves, and face paint to complete the look. Selicia could have just added real parts to the pair but, Marina had been insistent in her decision. As the night had progressed and Selicia&#39;s own boredom as well... Well, what they didn&#39;t notice wasn&#39;t going to hurt them this time would it?~ A smirk played on Selicia&#39;s face as Marina&#39;s swayed behind her as she flicked her new whiskers about her nose. Lisa on the other hand remaining coolly professional in her duty, her tail merely coiled as it hung behind her.<br />
<br />
The night carried on as more potential clients came and went collecting candy or merely overseeing it. Something nagged at Selicia as she made certain to entertain her potential clients... There was an oddity about their arrivals as she&#39;d considered the matter seriously. Another half an hour passed while she scrutinized the matter, when it struck her. The vast majority of the potential clients had been arriving from the same direction. This may not have been so odd if they&#39;d been on one extreme of the city or the other. Where they were situated was roughly in the middle of this side of the city limits... Yet the foot traffic was heavily leaning from the east rather than the west... Certainly they&#39;d seen people from that direction but, quite often in single or doubles, a portion of that being single-parented youth...<br />
<br />
Waiting patiently, sure enough a pair of young adults approached the gate and feeling something amiss, Selicia stepped forward herself. Without a word or gesture, she reached into the basket of one of the pair and pulled out the candy that caught her attention. Neither of the pair seemed to mind nor did her own pair of maids question the action... Not that either side had even noticed her doing so~ Soon the pair was leaving and Selicia returned to her evening&#39;s perch where she set to studying the candy prize.<br />
<br />
Rolling the packaged candy in her hand, she hadn&#39;t noted anything more than it being strangely shaped. The magic wafting off of it was faint enough to escape her bored attention, this leaving her to wonder just how many she may have missed. Opening the wrapper had revealed so much more as to the nature of the candy on the other hand... Laying unwrapped in her hand was the shape of an older man vaguely handsome in features. The chocolate figure was standing shock straight as if trying to pass for a candy bar as best it could. Amusingly the figure had rendered with it&#39;s member standing firm and proud between his legs. Candy to bare skin had caused it to start melting but, Selicia felt the profound confusion and fear within.<br />
<br />
The candy man bore a style of magic in the realm of a true witch... Not that that would cause her much trouble, the majority of the concern came from the sudden appearance of said witch. Operating fairly close to Selicia for who knows how long... This would not do... This would not do at all... Standing up and straightening out her dress, Selicia regarded her two maids with a casual expression. &quot;I&#39;m going for a walk, Dears~ Hold down the operation until I return would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mya-stress!&quot; Marina cheerily exclaimed loud enough to suffice for the both of them. Her tail coiling from side to side upright while she&#39;d even taken to purring. She hadn&#39;t seemed to notice any of her changes yet either... Either she was ignoring them or completely oblivious in the spirit of the evening.<br />
<br />
Selicia motioned for some arrivals to stand back as she passed before them. Her stride took on the form of a strut as she passed people on the street feeling ogling eyes on her. She&#39;d follow the trail of magical candies back to the source, no need to interrupt the flow. Let people enjoy a few once in a lifetime confections be they friend, lover, parent, or sibling~ After all, it&#39;s such a waste not to enjoy each other is it no?<br />
<br />
The further she walked, the closer to the edge of the city proper she&#39;d gotten. It wasn&#39;t that much longer before she&#39;d come upon an old house sitting on a hill. There was a conveniently uprooted &#39;Lot for Sale&#39; sign laying in the overgrown grass at the corner of the plot. So whomever this was... They weren&#39;t supposed to be here as it was. Standing up a bit straighter, Selicia exuded confidence with every step closer to the house proper. It was as she&#39;d gotten closer that she&#39;d seen the family knock on the door.<br />
<br />
The two youth were dressed up as some characters from one show or another. The mother was dressed as a shepherd filling out the costume with her motherly shape. She was curvy in the other sense without being concerning large. Beside her was the father whom had dressed Selicia assumed was dressed as a ram to couple with the shepherd. She could hear them talking from where she&#39;d stopped as they loudly exclaimed &#39;Trick or Treat!&#39; Ignoring the family from any further inspection, Selicia focused instead on the woman who&#39;d opened the door...<br />
<br />
An Older woman stood in the doorway looking to be of age to be a grandmother but, not yet a crone. In fact, she looked to be healthy and well aged judging by her more apparent features. Looking over the rest of her, Selicia could make some educated guesses about the figure that hid behind the shawl. She&#39;d be of modest shape at the very least, maybe starting to sag or gain wrinkles in places. All in all, she&#39;d become the definition of a finely aged wine for certain. Her gray hair was pulled back in a low hanging ponytail and she wore a matronly smile as she&#39;d passed out the candy. It was easy to see her methods for one schooled in the art. She&#39;d played nice and sweet as the charm wormed it&#39;s way around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be a dear and wait outside, will you? I just need a moment with your parents.&quot; She crooned softly as the parents casually walked inside the home.<br />
<br />
The two left outside merely waited outside chewing on pieces of candy. It was roughly a minute before the door opened once more and out stepped the mother, alone. The father was nowhere to be seen but, it the mother&#39;s hand was a large wad of cotton candy seated atop a curled ram horn. It was obvious to Selicia where the father had gone but, the wife casually plucked some of the candy into her mouth without a second thought. She&#39;d gathered her progeny and left the house behind picking at the candy she&#39;d been given.<br />
<br />
Once more, Selicia made to approach that door as a trio of young women pushed past her on their own way to the door. Being pushed aside had caused a spur of annoyance to drive into Selicia. She&#39;d kept the emotion contained as she didn&#39;t want to give herself away too soon. So feigning to be waiting for her own turn, she watched the trio approach the door just ahead of her. It was plain to see that the women were already tipsy from the night&#39;s festivities somewhere.<br />
<br />
The trio sported a sleek looking red head dressed as a tiger complete with the ear headband, paw gloves, and the tail sewn onto a striped tube dress. The brunette was of a fair shape, not too big nor too small. She&#39;d dressed as a classical school teacher with a plaid overall skirt, brown collared dress shirt, and white stockings running into dress shoes. Glasses resting on her nose being adjusted with her free hand while she carried a thick book in her basket laden hand. The final and biggest of the trio was a blonde who&#39;d played the classical angel card with a glow in the dark halo over head. Biggest not only in terms of height but, in bust and hips as well. It&#39;s too bad she was being preyed upon already... The fun she could have been~ The feeling of a charm reaching out to her only to be brushed away told Selicia she&#39;d been caught. No doubt the witch would sense that had meant the jig was up already, oh well...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my~ What sweet pretties have adorned my doorstep.&quot; The words cheerily playing in the air about the trio. Upon them becoming ensnared by her little charm, she straightened and began scrutinizing the young women. Her eyes immediately fell on the blonde as she sighed and shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Missy but you just don&#39;t make the cut at all. Such little effort for such a fine evening... No... I&#39;m afraid you lose by default.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eyes bleary from the drink and charm the blonde let out a single word before the changes overtook her. &quot;Huh...?&quot; She&#39;d already begun to shrink in size as her fair complexion had become fairer still. The other two calmly watched their shrinking friend as more changes made their mark. Her body started to lose it&#39;s definition little by little as her arms and legs puffed out looking plush rather than soft. Her skin becoming a pale white when she reached half height, her clothing having fallen about her on the floor. Selicia could almost make out a tattoo settled at the bottom of the small of her back. By now she was too small to say for certain however...<br />
<br />
The young woman barely seemed to care or register what was happening to her as her body had become a quarter of her natural height. Her skin now stark white as she struck a coy pose bringing one knee in front of the other, hand on her thigh, a coy wink with smile, and her other hand&#39;s index finger pressed against her cheek. Holding the pose, she shrank even further losing more definition as her body seemed to meld together into a single mass. Reaching a hand length in height, her form fell onto her white dress which wrapped swiftly about her. At the end of her change, Selicia couldn&#39;t make out what had become of her as what was left of her lay on the floor.<br />
<br />
The witch now turned her gaze on the other two who&#39;d acted like nothing out of the normal has occurred. &quot;Hmm... Now this is far better, at least it&#39;s not a stark contrast in effort as her&#39;s had been~&quot; Rubbing her chin, she looked between pair getting in close to some parts of their costumes. She was doing an admirable job of focusing on just that too. That must be her focus then or at least something along those lines. Straightening back up she seemed to come to a conclusion and faced the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve decided, I&#39;m sorry but, there can&#39;t be can&#39;t be two winners I&#39;m afraid.&quot; The words falling from her mouth matter-of-factly, as she laid her eyes of the tiger. &quot;With great consideration, I have decided that you...&quot; There was a pause adding a little suspense to the charade. With a smile in her eyes as much as her face, she finally continued. &quot;Are not the winner, sorry Dearie~&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking dejected rather than fearful, the red head openly consigned herself to defeat. There was an almost impatient look in the other girl&#39;s eyes as she watched her other friend change. This time, much to Selicia&#39;s disappointment, the women -and- her clothes shrank at the same rate. Her expression didn&#39;t change as she came closer to the floor with every passing second. Taking a deep breath, she heaved a heavy sigh and said something to her friend that Selicia had been just too far away to hear. Whatever it had been, it sparked the other woman&#39;s eyes alight with amusement.<br />
<br />
After whatever she had said, she sat on the floor with her legs spread wide hiking her dress. It snapped upward under the strain leaving her now small ass exposed to Selicia. As she shrank further in size her ass took a peachy glow and she raised her gloved hands up to either side of her head as she smiled brightly. A moment later and her face was no more than a decoration on her foot tall body. The young woman had had her form preserved in the form of a plush toy barely her likeness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, take your prizes for your costume and run along now~&quot; The old witch smiled and nodded her head to the side.<br />
<br />
Jumping and cheering the final woman picked up the doll and the small package swiftly. She was still giggling and laughing by the time she&#39;d reached Selicia. Just as she made to pass her, Selicia reached out and grabbed her by the arm causing her to drop her book. The book dropped down beneath her feet and came open facing upward. The woman had dropped her prizes too, as she was suddenly pulled downward. Her ass landing heavily on the pages of the book below. Dazed and confused, she&#39;d made to pull herself off of the book pressing her hands on the ground to no avail. With a jolt, her ass was partially pulled into the book to the book causing her to start and push harder against the ground. This still came to no avail as the book seemed to pull on her again dragging her deeper.<br />
<br />
She began to panic as she tried again and again to pull herself free from the consuming book. Selicia stepped over and reached out to the young woman. &quot;Here, let me help you~&quot; As the woman reached out to her, Selicia suddenly reached down grabbing hold of her skirt and pulling it off in one smooth motion. Screaming in surprise and dismay the brunette tried to cover herself but, her hands went instinctively to the ground by another pull of the book. She hadn&#39;t worn any panties that night as did neither of her friends... They&#39;d been dared at the party they&#39;d attended to go commando for a round of treats... When the book tugged again against those lips, she shuddered deeply. With yet another start, she&#39;d realized that she could feel the breeze blow across her chest. She&#39;d been laid bare to the world as the book swallowed yet more of her...<br />
<br />
Once her sex was entirely consumed by the book, she&#39;d folded in half with her knees almost pressed to her shoulders. Her arms were weakening quickly not only from the strain but, whatever it was playing with her sex. It probed and stroked her hidden lips as the book pulled again taking her to her stomach. She moaned softly trying to hold on to that need to escape as Selicia approached again still holding her skirt. Her hand was swept outward by a swift push of a foot and before she could put it back down, the book swallowed again and her hand landed within the pages. Shaking her head pleading between shudders and moans, she watched as Selicia toyed with her. There was a reach toward her unguarded breasts and then... A gentle pinch and twist of a nipple. The orgasm buckled her arm causing her elbow to pull into the pages...<br />
<br />
Now her arms could no longer spare her the descent into the book that hungrily consumed her. Another pull and her breasts rested atop the pages leaving her little more than a bust of herself with half an arm stuck upward. Selicia reached down effortlessly picking up the book and staring her in the eyes, whenever they&#39;d focused long enough or hadn&#39;t rolled. Off of the ground, the book seemed to become ravenous pulling her clear to her neck leaving her only a head and a hand... She watched in dismay as the book was being closed around her head. Making to scream one last time, an orgasm robbed her of the opportunity changing the tone from fear to pleasure before the book closed, silencing her. The title of the book now read; &quot;The Anatomy of a Naughty Teacher&quot; embossed with the young woman&#39;s legs held upward, spread eagle, and parting her lips open with both hands finely detailed.<br />
<br />
Collecting the other two former women, Selicia could finally see what had been done to them. The tiger red head was obvious of course with the exception that the false ears and tail were now &#39;real&#39; for her. Between her legs was an exposed red patch in the shape of a flame resting above a simple mound with the center folded inward. In her other hand was a plastic wrapper housing and showcasing a marshmallow angel teasing the viewer. The words printed across the front read; &#39;Angel Food Marshmallow Treat&#39;. Within the clear circle was the treat in question, posed vaguely as she had before her new form completed. Her features were dyed onto her body with yellow gummy ring resting on her head.<br />
<br />
Walking toward the witch with her gains stuffed in the bucket the last woman had held, Selicia smugly smiled. &quot;Looks like I was the real winner doesn&#39;t it?~&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch grimaced and sighed with a shake of her head. &quot;Quite rude to do that in someone else&#39;s territory isn&#39;t it...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny... I was thinking the same thing actually.&quot; Selicia stuck the barbed words in the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearie, the world is where I roam and these grounds are my territory. So, if you feel wronged... Let&#39;s set it aside, why don&#39;t you come in and stay a while, hmm?&quot; With a wave of her hand, the air rippled as the end of the walkway separating them from the world visibly.<br />
<br />
Into the proverbial Lions&#39; den went the pair, the witch following Selicia inside. The majority of the interior was dominated by the theme of Halloween with a handful of exceptions standing out visibly. A pair of Mr. and Mrs. Claus knick-knacks that looked like a young couple wearing cheap costumes. Another was a paper cut out of a man&#39;s face sticking out of the mouth of a rabbit costume. On a shelf was a pair of figurines likened to a leprechaun and a woman of gold in a cauldron. Lastly, a painting of a serene adult cupid was poised to strike with a modest ribbon giving him privacy. All of them, one and all were formerly human with the magic either fading or having long since faded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having been seated in the living room, Selicia waited for the old woman&#39;s return. She felt faint pricks of surrounding enchantments jabbing at her as they tried to find purchase. An idle problem of the house itself rather than deliberate attempts. Brushing them aside as they were meant for the average folk, Selicia saw the witch come back with a tray of pastries, a pair of tea cups, and a teapot. The magic emanated from the pastries and pot carried out of the spout with the steam. There was most certainly no way in the hells that she was going to partake of any of that. Abernathy had ingrained a marginal amount of wariness of spells and the like from other people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Dearie, enjoy some treats while we chat, hmm?&quot; The honeyed croon sought to smother the doubts in Selicia&#39;s mind. Now that... Was a deliberate attempt at effecting her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thank you but, I&#39;m watching my figure as you could probably tell.&quot; Puffing her chest out to accentuate the words as she smirked playfully. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t want to have it ruined again, after all~&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch merely sighed and shrugged filling a cup and taking a bite of a pastry. She -would- be immune to own spells and enchantments after all, just trying to lower Selicia&#39;s guard. &quot;As you say, as you say. Now, what brought you to my home this evening? Would you care to humor this old lady?&quot; The second attempt at enchanting Selicia directly this evening.<br />
<br />
Playing along with her line of questioning, Selicia spoke as if musing over her words. &quot;Well... I would like to keep an eye over what I would consider to be mine, as we all would... -And- I&#39;ve recently been given trouble by other... colleagues. So, I naturally have the inclination to seek out any more potential problems.&quot; Tapping her lip suggestively, Selicia sent a barb of her own just to prick the old witch with a simple message. &#39;I see you.&#39;<br />
<br />
The old witch sat up with a start as the barb struck but, carried no effect of it&#39;s own. Eyes narrowing slightly, she continued. &quot;I see, run into the undesirables and assume more must be. Understandable, understandable. I don&#39;t intend to stay here, I&#39;m merely visiting to admire the world and take a few trinkets for memory sake. Maybe even sample some of the local delicacy~&quot; This time no return effort was made as she eyed Selicia,<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite~ There have been a number of -delicacies- finding their way to me, I&#39;m quite the glutton after all.&quot; Casually Selicia gestured to the bucket with tonight&#39;s catch.<br />
<br />
With a snap of her fingers, the old witch seemed to come upon an idea. She rose and walked out of the room excusing herself for a moment. The house seemed to pick up on something and the prodding came at a stronger, more frequent pace. It had gone from being a pest to being outright annoying as it grated on Selicia&#39;s patience. When the witch returned to the room, Selicia had to quickly smooth out her bristling demeanor. What the witch produced from her excursion was a magically glittering opal carved into the shape of a elegantly posed woman. Inspecting the carving from her seated position, the woman was strikingly similar to Selicia in form.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might say I have some more exotic tastes too. It&#39;s nothing personal Dearie but, it&#39;s been so long~&quot; Thrusting her hand outward with that matronly expression still on her face, the house&#39;s efforts redoubled into an assault.<br />
<br />
From thorns, to barbs, to gnashing teeth went the house&#39;s enchantments as they became ferocious. A threat? Not on their own but, something to bear in mind as Selicia jumped up to her feet. &quot;I believe you understand what this means~&quot; Selicia sent the power from her toward the old woman only to find it scatter before her. Well, it seemed the old witch really did know what her actions would mean... Back and forth, the house attempting to &#39;crush&#39; Selicia and Selicia battered the witch&#39;s own defense in turn. Feeling that a prolonged two pronged battle would not be in her favor... Selicia moved to a more, indirect method of attack.<br />
<br />
Turning her attention to the knick-knacks on a nearby shelf, she sent a spiraling barb toward them meant to break them. Certainly enough, the witch spared some of her defense automatically to protect the trinkets. Seeing the opening as it happened, Selicia struck fast into the opening sending the spell biting but not deep enough. It held but, it could be staved off without too much extra effort. Keeping a hand on her stricken side, the witch kept her smile as the teapot spouted it&#39;s contents toward Selicia. Now that was just unsportsmanlike... Managing to keep it from contacting skin, it did splatter the dress causing the fabric to eat away small holes.<br />
<br />
It takes two to duel as it were, so Selicia sent a stronger shattering spell at the teapot itself. Again, automatically the warding made to cover for the attacked possession. The follow up on her behalf was much more potent as well as it struck from the other side of the witch. This time it had a noticeable effect on it&#39;s target reducing her in size a full half. Laid bare by the sudden change in stature the witch grit her teeth and muttered something distinctly arcane. Roaring to life the fireplace which had been dormant burst toward Selicia. A hair later from that dodge and Selicia might&#39;ve been badly burned. A chord had been struck and she wasn&#39;t going to have any part of it.<br />
<br />
Flames aside, she made to attack the house itself after that outburst... Mustering her concentration, Selicia struck outward not in focus but a wave. Sure enough, the protection afforded the witch scattered to combat the wave as a wall against the sea. Stepping toward the witch now that the house and her were both focused on the defense, Selicia simply reached out... And grabbed the old witch by the throat... Directly pouring power from her into the other woman, Selicia stared into her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it wasn&#39;t intended to do anymore than distract me but, I simply can&#39;t overlook the attempt. Now you are lain bare to me, my power, and my whim. It was a night to remember but, simply one you won&#39;t end as human...&quot;<br />
<br />
In her hand the old witch became lighter and smaller still. The magics of the two women still colliding about them causing turmoil in the air. Her skin took on a gloss as she reach a quarter of her initial height feeling of ceramic. Her body then bloated outward as if she&#39;d been squashed to that height versus being shrunken down. As her features were now more or less painted onto her body, she felt hollow more than light. The last overt change before the magics in the air died down and the house became docile was the hole form in the top of her head...<br />
<br />
With the witch dealt with, Selicia sat the candy jar down on the table and started to casually peruse the house. She pulled down the objects she&#39;d noted earlier, making them of size to fit inside the jar if necessary as she went. Arriving upstairs, she&#39;d found the bedroom area quickly enough containing a book of formulae and enchantments and a number of candied people. She took the moment to search through the book and found the spell behind the candy making process. Not only had the victim become a treat of varying design, aspects of the victim would be transferred to the host the following morning... She&#39;d thought back to the chocolate man she&#39;d almost considered eating with a shudder. Feeling the house warping and and groaning under a strain, she&#39;d returned to the first room, gathered her belongings, and left out the front door.<br />
<br />
As she made it to the sidewalk again, she&#39;d just stepped out in time for the midnight bell to toll. The house had gone and with it returned the empty plot as it had been prior. Seems the witch had told the truth about not intending to stay for very long... Well... Now she would be staying~ Regarding the nude candy jar under her arm momentarily with a smile. She&#39;d walked back home to find Marina and Lisa awaiting her at the gates where she&#39;d left them. Something had escaped her that night that mercifully reared it&#39;s ugly head as she walked past the pair onto her grounds. With an imperceptible snap of thread, her battered dress fell to the ground and she sighed. Removing her wide brim hat and settling in on the jar, she ran her fingers along the brim as it formed the perfect lid. She could feel Marina&#39;s blush without even seeing her face...<br />
<br />
With a sigh a defeat, Selicia turned and said &quot;Happy Halloween...&quot;</p>
