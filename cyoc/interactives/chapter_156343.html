<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff could not help but gawk at the two-headed teen his older brothers had become. They were lounging on the floor with two of their friends on either side of them. Despite his brothers being identical twins and previously dressing and grooming themselves in very similar ways, Jeff usually did not have trouble telling them apart. From his vantage point at the foot of the stairs, he could see Chris, the twins&#39; left head, speaking with Dominic, and Josh, the head on the right, speaking with Myles. They laughed and talked as if nothing was wrong, as if they were not suddenly sharing a body. <br />
<br />
Chris was the first to notice him. &quot;Jeff, what are you staring at?&quot; His brother called up to him. That seemed to get Josh&#39;s attention as well, who tried to turn his neck to see his younger brother. Their back was turned so that Chris had the clearest view. The other twin had to turn his neck, and seem to try and force their torso to turn awkwardly towards the right. The movement made Chris loudly complain, &quot;Dude, that hurts.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then turn with me so I can see him too.&quot; Jeff heard Josh tell his twin. They rotated their torso, so both had a better view of him. &quot;Hey Jeff, come on down and join us for a bit!&quot; <br />
<br />
The invite from one his brothers to join their group of friends to watch a game would have been unusual, but for both of them to invite him, that was beyond atypical. While he did not particularly care to play, Jeff always enjoyed watching some of the football games, but his brothers never invited him to join them before. They were always &#39;too cool&#39; to have their little brother join them with their friends around. Even when their friends were not around, Josh and Chris usually did not usually include him in anything. Despite the unusual invite, Jeff walked down the stairs to join his brothers. As he approached, the others in the room greeted him warmly, which was also strange. Their friends had never been rude to him before, but they had also never really paid him much attention either.  <br />
<br />
Myles scooted over so Jeff could sit next to Josh, and upon taking a seat, his brother playfully socked him in the arm. &quot;If you wanted to watch the game too, all you had to do was ask.&quot; Josh commented to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jeff replied, not sure how to respond to his brothers sudden change of attitude. The game started back up again, and the twins and their group of friends, go lost in the action. Jeff, on the other hand, was too perplexed by the twins to pay too much attention. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched them.<br />
<br />
They seemed to be wearing the same outfit they had when first returning to the house. They wore a single pair of sweatpants, a tank top, and a school jersey over that. The tank top and jersey were the only thing that looked, slightly different. Jeff decided after awhile that they seemed to be bigger, wider than what the twins had worn previously. But, that made since in Jeff&#39;s mind because his brothers&#39; shoulders seemed to be broader than what he remembered. <br />
<br />
He continued to steal glances at his brothers throughout the first half of the game, fascinated. Chris would wispier something to Josh, and in response, their right hand scratch their left shoulder, as if relieving an itch. When a touchdown occurred on their favored team, the twins would sometimes fist bump each other. At one point, one of the referees seemed to make an unpopular call, and Josh seemed to try and stand up to better yell at the TV. However, there seemed to be a slight lag where Chris would try and follow his brother&#39;s action in standing. <br />
<br />
Jeff concluded that his brother, while only having a single body, seemed to not really share control of it. He guessed that Chris operated the left-hand side, and Josh operated the right-hand side. That realization made Jeff even more curious how the two wrestled or played football together. Jeff also wondered if the twins were nicer to him because they grew up differently. <br />
<br />
After the game broke for the half-time, Jeff took his leave of the group. His mind was spinning with questions about his brothers, but his discovery made him even more curious about the Chronivac. What else could he do with it? Did he want to experience having a twin like his brothers? Were the changes permanent?</p>
