<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning for the Ross family came with a bit of relief for all sides involved. Kent and Diana were relieved that Connor had actually come out and talked to them on the subject. The fact that he was conflicted and likely bisexual had never been a problem for them. Both of them were quite loving parents and there were some times where both might have admitted to themselves that they might have even spoiled Connor and Ava at times, and while the things they had found that had them &quot;worried&quot; were surprising, they didn&#39;t change the love they had for their son. In some ways they didn&#39;t think they could fully help Connor solve whatever questions he might have, but at least openly talking about it would be something that would let things move forward. It had been more the fact that Connor had been so defensive and guarded on the issue before that had been their real concern, like Connor was fearful of them. Neither Kent nor Diana wanted that.<br />
<br />
For Connor, the relief was in the acceptance and comfort that his parents had given him when he did tell them. To a great extent, Connor expected that, as he&#39;d known his parents to be rather open about the things hey accepted. However, the uncertainty that he&#39;d had regarding his sexuality was something that personally embarrassed him, particularly as people he&#39;d grown up with seemed to figure things out pretty quickly. He&#39;d remember various talks with Tad while they&#39;d been in Virginia through much of their high school years in which they would talk about girls in the way that teenage boys always did. Tad was always disciplined and respectful, but it was also always clear that Tad was into women. And at times, Connor fully agreed and still did, there were plenty of beautiful women out there and on certain levels, Connor wouldn&#39;t necessarily be opposed to any sort of &quot;romantic&quot; encounter.<br />
<br />
However, when Connor began having feelings of attraction to males as well and having those feelings push and pull at him, he&#39;d gotten the sensation of not knowing who he was. After all, Tad was straight and as were most of his friends in Virginia. Connor really didn&#39;t know anyone that was bisexual, that he knew of, and thus couldn&#39;t share that sort of experience with, and thus the more he thought and wondered on it, the more embarrassed he got on the fact that he didn&#39;t have answers. At present he still didn&#39;t have real answers, but the open acceptance he&#39;d gotten from his parents was a good thing and put him at ease over dinner the previous night and through the morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you talked with mom and dad, Connor,&quot; Ava said to him as the two walked toward the bus stop for their street, &quot;they love you and would never reject you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but I&#39;m still trying figure things out,&quot; Connor sighed, &quot;and I&#39;d originally hoped to have answers before saying anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you talk with mom and dad, then?&quot; Ava asked, knowing that the conversation had been had given that some of it carried into dinner from the night before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tad and Ryan sorta gotten some clues on some things, the way you did and wanted to talk on it yesterday,&quot; Connor admitted, &quot;and since they&#39;ve been helping me with regard to what were to be... they wanted to help and figured telling mom and dad was the smart thing to do. And... well... Tad and I have been friends for quite awhile, so I figured to go along with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ava shrugged and nodded as they approached the bus stop for their street, and it wasn&#39;t long before big yellow bus came into view. It came up and slowly eased to a stop. Ava was quick to hop on as the doors opened as some of the other students that were already waiting there moved to follow. Connor was about to go after her when a familiar voice called out to him and he turned to see Ryan jog across the street and approach him. It made Connor smile a bit as Ryan came up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He Connor...&quot; Ryan said slowly, &quot;How did things go with your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite well,&quot; Connor said with some relief, &quot;I&#39;ve been nervous about how they&#39;d respond to me... well... not knowing for sure and I didn&#39;t want to worry them. But they were quite accepting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded as they climbed up the stairs and walked along the center aisle between the seats. The two walked about halfway down the bus and settled into a seat that was a couple seats behind Ava&#39;s. Connor waved to his sister as he went by, and while she waved back, she also stayed in her seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Ryan said, &quot;it means you can be open and ask questions on what you need to figure out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure they know whether or not they&#39;re bi or anything like that,&quot; Connor answered softly, &quot;and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to figure out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They can still help,&quot; Ryan told him, &quot;and that will be key to helping reason things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Connor commented with a small shrug, &quot;though I&#39;d still try to see on where things go from where they are now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can help you there a bit,&quot; Ryan spoke, &quot;Help you meet with some of the smaller weres... and some may be male or female and that can help you gage and weigh things with regard to where your sexuality lies specifically. It&#39;s something that many weres would work well with... in that we&#39;re sorta built for sexual attraction. Male or female...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if that doesn&#39;t help me figure things out?&quot; Connor looked Ryan and doing his best to keep his voice low, though it was possible that some of the other weres that might still overhear.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that happens... you might be able to see a therapist if it&#39;s really something that you can&#39;t figure out on your own,&quot; Ryan told him, &quot;but I&#39;d think it would be something anyone can figure out. It just may be a bit more difficult for some...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like me,&quot; Connor said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like anyone,&quot; Ryan answered and gave a soft playful punch to Connor&#39;s shoulder, &quot;the things people wrestle with will always vary... but in the end, everyone still has to figure out their problems on their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As opposed to the problems that takes a team to solve?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Ryan gave a nervous cringe for a moment as the bus began to pull up in front of the high school, &quot;some things like this reveal issue may take more than one person... either to make it work or adapt to the consequences that come from it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bus came to a bit of a lurching stop as came in front of the high school. Once it stopped Connor and Ryan stood up. Ryan looked around as he did so, as the &quot;big reveal&quot; that was planned was likely to be controversial for quite awhile, and he didn&#39;t seriously think the one fight that broke out on the steps before the school the previous Monday would be the last that Moon Lake would see people letting tempers get the better of them. As such, Ryan knew he had to be careful, for as a werewildcat, he knew that if he said the wrong thing and a larger were took offense, he wouldn&#39;t be able to protect Connor. Connor looked at him as they made their way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Consequences?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... revealing the existence of weres and with proof that can&#39;t be denied or written off as a stunt will have consequences,&quot; Ryan nodded, &quot;things that even if the general reaction is positive will mean change in Moon Lake. For even if the town&#39;s secret stays secret, that doesn&#39;t mean that the rest of the world won&#39;t be paying greater attention then before and Moon Lake will have to adapt to suit their needs and requirements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I could see where everyone would have to come together on that,&quot; Connor commented, &quot;especially if Moon Lake&#39;s weres are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid...?&quot; Ryan finished for him as they went down the stairs to head off the bus, &quot;yeah... though personally, I&#39;d think that guys like Tad will end up being more valuable in a post reveal Moon Lake than others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tad?&quot; Connor wondered, &quot;but we just watched TV and played video games together. He told he had some idea in working in computer programing so he could design video games and that sort of thing. Never got into the &quot;save the world&quot; thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be based on what you know of Tad as a person,&quot; Ryan answered, &quot;but he was born a werewolf and wasn&#39;t born in Moon Lake. As such he grew up outside of many of the things that make Moon Lake unique. There can be some things that will relate to how one becomes a were and how a were&#39;s first transformation, even those who were born weres, are handled that are likely vastly different from Moon Lake. In this if the reveal brings certain changes to Moon Lake... guys like Tad who grew up in a world where he had to be extra careful so not to hurt anyone by accident or reveal the were secret by accident might actually know how to adapt to things in a way that those of us who were born in Moon Lake aren&#39;t prepared or ready for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Connor mused slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but for right now, we can&#39;t really be sure as to what the changes are as the reveal hasn&#39;t happened, yet,&quot; Ryan reminded him.</p>
