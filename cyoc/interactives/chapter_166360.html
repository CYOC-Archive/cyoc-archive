<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Have a little faith, Jeremy! I have full confidence in Mr. Trent&#39;s ability to satisfy your new... needs,&quot; said the Collector to the lizard he had just collected. He was walking up the steps of a lavish mansion to ring the doorbell. Inside, a 15-year-old boy had arranged to be home alone except for some maids in the backroom. His wealthy parents gave him essentially anything he wanted, and a few hours of privacy was an inexpensive request.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice to see you again, Joe. My services have been successfully carried out. I was so excited I couldn&#39;t help but mention the impressive size of the payment you&#39;re offering in return.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smug brat took out several stacks of hundreds, showing off the funds he had almost unfettered access to. &quot;As I said, name your price,&quot; said Joe with the confidence of a top tier CEO. &quot;There&#39;s a checkbook under my third bed if we need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Collector looked at Joe&#39;s hundreds and chuckled. &quot;I don&#39;t have any need for your human currency, dear customer,&quot; he said. Joe grinned even wider. This was going to be easier than he thought. &quot;What would you prefer, then? I&#39;m sure I can make it happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The middle-aged man smiled at Joe and answered soothingly. &quot;I&#39;m The Collector, Joe. You should know that all I want is more for my collection. The price I name is your humanity.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words sunk in, and Joe&#39;s grin faded. &quot;Wait, you don&#39;t mean... Oh, that was a joke! Good one... You... you wouldn&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Collector just smiled, watching the rich boy squirm. Two short brush-like appendages branched out from the boy&#39;s face and started twitching around as they came online with his nervous system. His stomach rumbled and his mouth started to water as he started to smell food in every direction. &quot;What&#39;s happening? I ... I smell all kinds of ... oh ... OH ...&quot; The stunned teen didn&#39;t recognize the additions as his new antennae. He just knew that he was overwhelmed with aromas that he wouldn&#39;t have noticed without them. He twitched his feathery sensors around to take it all in from new angles while his brain sorted through the onslaught scents. He could smell the fruit and deserts in the mansion&#39;s kitchen as well as bread, meat, sugars, veggies, moist proteins, and freshly killed flesh in different directions from all around the outdoors. He didn&#39;t realize he was smelling all the kitchens, rubbish, feces, and roadkill from several miles around. But he did know that he was tempted to run off in search of the tantalizing smorgasbords that surrounded him.<br />
<br />
Then his eyes started to change. They bulged up and outgrew their lids as they became two giant compound lens surfaces covering most of the sides and much of the top of his face. His vision split up into a mosaic of countless little &quot;view-screens&quot; giving him scenes from multiple directions all around him. He couldn&#39;t focus in on any one direction anymore, but he could immediately take stock of all the motions and shapes around him. &quot;My ... my eyes...&quot; he mumbled, seeing the Collectors smile in a small part of his almost panoramic field of view. This was quickly supplemented with a second sort of &quot;vision&quot; as three simpler eyes grew in at the top of Joe&#39;s head. His brain could construct a full map of light and darkness out of the signals he was getting from up there. Still retaining his vocal cords for now, the young punk groaned.<br />
<br />
His shirt was soon sliced by a prickly pair of segmented limbs that burst out from his sides. He screamed as they waved around before finding their way to the ground taking part of his weight for him. &quot;Seriously, man, what&#39;s happening?! What are you doing to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just collecting on a debt,&quot; answered the pixelated man in front of him. Joe knew very well The Collector was taking his humanity, but he just couldn&#39;t acknowledge that. His heart sank as his arms covered themselves in exoskeleton and grew hairs and claws and sticky pads to match his side limbs. He wished he could look away or clothes his eyes and not have to see them, but his new vision didn&#39;t work that way. The change in his arms was soon followed by a pulsing sensation from his back, signaling the emergence of two large transparent membranes with thick dark veins tunneling through them. A smaller pair emerged from further back. He fluttered them, amazing himself with powerful flow of air they generated around him. &quot;W-w-w-wings?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Collector spoke again: &quot;Pests like you are some of the most satisfying additions to my collection. The very idea: selling your friends out just so you can have the world to yourself. You deserve to follow your greed and lust in a more fitting body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe was awestruck that he could fly now if he wanted to, but he didn&#39;t want to join his former friends in the inhuman fate he had planned for them. He buzzed his wings in agitation at the consequence he was being given. Didn&#39;t this &quot;collector&quot; know who he was? Who his parents were? No one ever dared to treat him this way, like some sort of poor kid with only one swimming pool! But what could he do about it if he wasn&#39;t even going to be human anymore?<br />
<br />
His legs (or rather his back legs) firmed up into the kind of insectoid legs of which he had four of already. An abdominal segment grew out behind them and carried his anus with it. It got covered up with his exoskeleton and so did his thorax and head. His mouth completely rearranged in a way that made it feel completely numb for like a full minute. When it wore off, he had two barely mobile mandibles splayed out in from of him with a weird... something in between them that he could stick out. He shoved the thing forward and saw it was a long tube with a wide spongy protrusion on the end of it. Was he supposed to eat through that somehow? Oh well, he was going to be trying it soon because he wasn&#39;t going to be able to resist the smells from his antennae much longer.<br />
<br />
The mysterious man waved his arms and then all of a sudden Joe found a giant was towering over him in both of his distinct vision channels. What just happened?! He had become... tiny? Joe despaired as it sank in that he was just a bug now. He turned his wings back on and released his suction pads using the claws at the end of his six legs, and he took off, quickly raising himself high above the man who had done this to him.<br />
<br />
The Collector effortless caught the disoriented housefly in a little jar with holes in it to take back the The Collection with him. It was time to decide who would be next.</p>
