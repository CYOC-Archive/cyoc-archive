<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking back at his computer, Jeff thought about changing other things but decided against it for now. Although even if he had wanted to, he knew that was out of question when he heard a voice, he recognized as his mother’s, call to him, “Jeff. If you don’t come down right now, you will be doing chores for a month.”<br />
<br />
Although she had been more lax previously, Jeff, with his new memories, knew how serious his mother was and rushed downstairs. Arriving at the bottom of the stairs, he saw his new father and brother already sitting at the table. He took out his chair and sat down at the table as his mother was walking back from the oven with a steaming dish. The dish, which looked unfamiliar to Jeff, filled the room with a wonderful smell and was making his mouth water. Like in his old reality, Jeff’s mother was an excellent cook. Jeff’s father liked to joke that it was the reason he married her. Curious, he looked at his little brother, whose name he remembered was Oliver; his brother looked somewhat similar to Jeff although there were differences. He had slightly lighter skin and he seemed to have a more slender build than him but had the same black hair as his older brother and father.<br />
<br />
After his mother served everyone, they started talking about the various activity of their days, more so him and his brother than his parents. Whilst they were talking, Jeff realised he knew that his father worked as an accountant and that Oliver was in 8th grade. When he got to discussing football practice, he could see that his father wasn’t as happy as his mother. He thought it was strange until his new memories told him that it was because hiss father had wanted him to play soccer instead. He was now pressuring Oliver to join the soccer team since he could not make Jeff do so. So he decided to shorten his talk about football as to not sour the mood at the table. After they had finished eating, Oliver asked him about different exercises Jeff did at practice since he wanted to bulk up like his big brother, although that would be a bit more difficult with his slender build. Jeff was happy he was close to his new little brother, he could get used to such family dinners...<br />
<br />
With dinner done and the dishes cleaned, something Jeff always helped with in this new reality, he went up to his bedroom. Closing the door and making sure to lock it, Jeff went back to his computer were the Chronivac was still open and again looked at his family tree. For now, he chose not to change his father side of the tree and instead looked at his mother&#39;s. Since he hadn&#39;t changed her, it was still his two original grandparents who were displayed on the tree and looking at them he wondered what to do next for a moment. He thought again about using the &quot;Randomize&quot; option, however he didn&#39;t really want to leave his ancestry to chance especially after the amazing results he had with &quot;Generate&quot;, maybe he would test it on someone else later... Having come up with a rough idea of what he wanted to do he clicked on his grandfather&#39;s portrait, and now that someone was filling the slot, a new option called &quot;Adjust&quot; appeared, but he selected &quot;Generate&quot; again. His grandfather wasn&#39;t the most... appealing guy even in this de-aged model his short brown hair and his dull green eyes, did not accentuate his face, and his short and thin body didn&#39;t help in the looks department either. Unfortunately, while he approved of his daughter&#39;s husband before, Ayaan, his father in this reality did not enjoy the same approval, probably because they were so different from each other. As a result he wasn&#39;t as fond of his grandchildren, as he was towards Jeff in his previous reality. Thankfully, he was sure that changing him would also change his relationship with his father and with the changes he had plan he knew it would be for the better.<br />
<br />
He quickly typed the five key words he had thought about; &quot;Blond&quot; went in first, he wondered if that would affect him, even if he knew it was unlikely, it was followed by &quot;Muscular&quot; , &quot;Masculine&quot;, &quot;Well-hung&quot; and &quot;Tall&quot; since he wanted to see how much that would improve his already much nicer body. &quot;Generate&quot; brought up a lot less variety this time. All the men had similar pale complexions with blond hair and most had blue or green eyes. Unlike &quot;Athletic&quot;, &quot;Muscular&quot; seemed to give bulkier body types, although some were still somewhat lean, the majority of them looked like they worked out regularly, though none looked like bodybuilders. Like earlier, &quot;Well-hung&quot; seemed to have worked like a charm, as all of them had relatively large endowments between their legs. Jeff narrowed it down to one of the moderately muscular guys with a broad chest and thick arms and with sharp green eyes. He was uncircumcised and had one of the larger endowments which even seemed thicker, albeit a bit shorter, than his father&#39;s. He was also quite tall at 6&#39;3&quot; and had a rather square face. He selected him and the tree above him started to change.<br />
<br />
However he wasn&#39;t done with his maternal grandparents, since he had also decided to change his grandmother. Much like her husband, his grandmother was rather plain looking even when she was young, plain brown hair, a soft face, and a plump body, although her blue eyes did stand out. He clicked on her portrait and selected &quot;Generate&quot; once more. He pondered over the words he would type and ended up choosing &quot;Ginger&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Shapely&quot;, &quot;Athletic&quot; and &quot;Fecund&quot;. He really wasn&#39;t sure about the last word, since it didn&#39;t describe her appearance but rather her fertility, but the Chronivac didn&#39;t complain. He only put that last one because he hoped it would mean he would have more siblings but he wasn&#39;t sure if it would work. Like for his grandfather, there was less variety in the women generated but it was still decent. He looked over all of them, and indeed, they were all gorgeous but there was one that caught his attention. The woman had fiery red hair and a small amount of freckles on her face, as well as, sapphire blue eyes. She had ample breasts and a nice bottom without either of these being obscenely large on her slender body. She was even quite tall for a woman at 5&#39;11&quot;. He selected her and like his grandfather the tree above her started changing with people that looked similar to her.<br />
<br />
Afterwards the update option appeared over his portrait , this time with his mother&#39;s also grayed out. He didn&#39;t know what or how much this would change, but that was part of the fun. As soon as he clicked the button, the heat returned, though it was much more subtle this time. His skin stayed the same color, however his eyes seemed brighter than usual. Then he felt his hips and shoulders adjusting again, his waist narrowing slightly as his shoulders broadened more, barely a few inches but the change in his silhouette was striking. His feet gained yet another shoe size, becoming size 12 as he gained a couple of inches in height putting him at a nice 6&#39;2&quot;. His face shifted again, becoming more angular. Jeff&#39;s muscles followed next, none jumping spectacularly in size, but his chest and arms thickened a bit more, much like his legs and his six pack seemed more defined; overall it enhanced what he had gotten from his father. As the tingling returned to his cock, he pushed down his shorts to his knees to let his hardening member free. It gained lengthened to around 8&quot;, and got substantially thicker. He was probably the biggest guy in school by far,&#39;Hell&#39; he thought, he could probably show up most porn stars. His balls also grew a bit looking to be about the size of golf balls. The heat moved again, and all his body hair seemed to thicken just a bit, becoming a bit denser, but there wasn&#39;t much change to the amount of it on his body. The warmth subsided and he took in his new reflection in the mirror. He was definitely hotter and bigger than before, although it wasn&#39;t as drastic of a change compared to the first time. His room didn&#39;t seem to change, except maybe for a few more awards on his shelf.<br />
<br />
Looking at the time on his computer, Jeff realised how late it had gotten and a yawn suddenly escaped his mouth. However, his recent transformation had made him quite horny, so he decide to get a quick one in before going to sleep. Laying down on his bed after shutting off his computer, he slowly wrapped a hand around his already hard cock. It was definitely larger than most, and it thrilled him to no longer be one of the smallest guy in the locker room, making him twitch in anticipation. The addition of his foreskin made the head much more sensitive and he moaned as he pulled it back, running his thumb over the red tip. Precum leaked out, the moisture aiding him as he began to build a rhythm, pumping his cock up and down. His free hand ran across his chest as he felt his newly grown muscles, and reveled in how firm they were. He jerked his cock faster as he explored his form in the dark, admiring the raw manliness of it. He grabbed onto his big balls and gently squeezed, gasping as he finally lost control, his cock twitching as thick white cum erupted from it splattering all over his abs. After a quickly cleaning up he put on his shorts and hit the hay.</p>
