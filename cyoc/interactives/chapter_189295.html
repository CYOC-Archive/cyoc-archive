<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What do we do now, Don? We are still labeled as dog-slaves. I like being this way, since Matt wished it for me, but I don´t want to be a slave to anyone. I guess you wouldn´t want, as well?” Billy asked shortly later, watching Matt´s tail wagging. It had something hypnotizing to him.<br />
“No, I don´t really want to be a dog-slave to anyone, even if I have to admit, it´s interesting.” Don than asked another question: “Billy, do you remember there always being dog-slaves, or is it something that only happened today?”<br />
“Huh? We have dog-slaves for ages. Why? But if I remember correctly, Matt asked me about that, too. Don´t tell me that is because off our little beta dog down here.” Billy said, realizing that was possible.<br />
“It´s weird. I was on my way home for winter break, and just as I arrived, my clothes vanish and my own dad says I´m Matt´s dog-slave. We had no dog-slaves before, or slaves in general in a long time.” Don explained his question. He, too, looked down at Matt, who had his tail by now between his legs in fear.<br />
With a sigh, Billy pointed the wand at Matt´s quivering form. They had to know for sure, and only Matt could tell them. “Now Matt, was all this slavery thing your doing?” he then asked in a stern voice.<br />
Matt was even more quivering now as he started to answer: “Rrrruff! Woof! Arff... was an accident. I only wanted Don to be my obedient dog-boy, but it changed more than I wanted. Please, let´s just forget all this and turn us all back Billy.”<br />
Don looked down at his quivering beta and asked angrily: “You only wanted me to be your slave? As if that isn´t bad enough. What weird, warped fantasy of yours is this?”<br />
While still quivering, Matt turned a bit red. “I always wanted to dominate you, Don, so I wished for that. I hadn´t thought much further after that.”<br />
“And me? Why have you used that wand on me, little beta?” Billy asked, sounding interested in the answer.<br />
“I thought Don needed a playmate, and also wanted another dog-boy. But the start was you daring me, it just happened from there.” Matt explained carefully.<br />
“So, all this was just spontaneous from your wish to dominate Don, and I was just another easy one to get?” Billy asked him, now sounding disappointed in Matt.<br />
Matt, fearing what they would do now, could only nod. He just hoped they would stop this madness now.<br />
Both Don and Billy thought about this for a minute, deciding on what to do. “As I said, thanks to Matt, I like being naked and all, but I don´t want to remain a slave. Maybe we should end this slavery thing all together, but keep it that being naked in public isn´t seen as bad.” Billy said to Don, ignoring Matt for now.<br />
Don nodded. “Yeah, that way we could enjoy this situation without someone owning us, and slavery is a bad thing. But than what to do about our little beta here?”<br />
“Please, just let us forget … “, Matt started, but Billy interrupted him.<br />
 “Silence. I would just keep him this way, maybe make him look like a normal dog as a punishment for doing this to us. We could see if he behaves and how we like keeping a dog, and then decide if we change him back later or keep him. Or, if he doesn´t behave, send him into a shelter.” At that, Billy grinned down at the now whimpering Matt.<br />
“That sounds good. And we get to enjoy our little beta a bit longer. And if we change him back, he can still be our beta, just as a human. But I wouldn´t put him into a shelter if he misbehaves, I would neuter him instead.” Don said with an evil glint, making Matt´s whimpering even louder.<br />
“Please no, I will behave. I …” Matt begged, and both Don and Billy laughed at him. Billy then used the wand, wishing for the slavery to end, but that being naked or in such dog-gear or similar things being seen as normal. As they watched, the other slaves slowly returned to normal, meaning most of them got back normal clothing and stood up on two legs, but some kept their dog-gear and remained on all fours. A few others had their gear changed, they spotted someone dressed as a cat and another as a donkey.<br />
Don and Billy themselves kept their gear, as well. But as it was allowed, nobody seemed to have problems with the dog-geared people. To most it seemed that Don and Billy just played with their dog.<br />
Matt was shocked that nothing changed for him. For now, he neither changed back into a normal human, nor did he become a full dog. Just his old, naked self with fore-paws and a tail, and smaller than before. And he still couldn´t get back up.<br />
When nothing else happened around them anymore, Billy and Don both looked down onto their little beta. “Do we make him more dog-like or should we keep him like he is, Billy?” Don asked, his dick already twitching.<br />
“Please just turn me back ... “whimpered Matt between them, hoping that they would show him mercy.<br />
“Hmmm... I guess we could keep him like he is now, for now. Only one little thing, it was better as it was before, so ...” Billy said and waved the wand at Matt.<br />
Like before Matt felt dizzy shortly, and whined loudly when he again his speech turned into barking. “Nooorrrffff ruff ruff woof.”<br />
Don laughed at their beta´s misfortune. “Yeah, that´s better, no begging and whining to be turned back. But isn´t that really uncomfortable for him? I mean, while his fore-paws are fit for walking everywhere, his feet aren´t that good, right?”<br />
Billy thought about it shortly. “I think you are right, he should be more comfortable walking on all fours if this four are more similar.” With that said, he waved the wand again over Matt, this time more towards Matt´s bare feet.<br />
Matt whined as he didn´t want more changes being made to him. Just as like before with his hands, his feet deformed and bulged up, until his feet looked like a second pair of dog&#39;s paws. And while he still hated what happened here, he had to admit that his new set of paws felt more comfortable on the ground as his bare feet had.<br />
Don petted Matt lightly as he looked at Billy, Asking: “What now?”<br />
“You find out if you exist again by calling your family, if you want to. If not, or if you want to afterwards, you can live with me. We can use the wand to expand my flat for us to live in together with our little doggy here. Then we can see what to do next.” Billy suggested, and Don decided he could check on his family later. Now, he wanted some time with his new boyfriend, as he and Billy seemed to be that now, and their little beta. “I will check that later. But we will also need to check on Matt´s father, we don´t really know how our beta is seen right now. And see if your flat I still yours, as you were a dog-slave as well.”<br />
“If everything worked like it should, it should be as if our little beta never made any changes to the world, that would normally include you, but I guess we should check it anyway then.” Billy said, and lead the way for Don to his flat, Matt unwillingly made to follow them to their new home.</p>
