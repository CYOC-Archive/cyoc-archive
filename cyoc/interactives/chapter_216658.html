<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob let out a feral scream that sounded more like a sexual moan as he lunged at Jules, tiny fist raised and what little muscles he had tensed. He&#39;d kick the little bastard&#39;s ass and then he&#39;d figure out just HOW this nightmare happened, and get out of this walking wet dream body! He darted across the cheap, peeling linoleum floor on the strange heeled sandals that were freezing his feet off and with a grunt swung his fist directly at so-called friend&#39;s face...<br />
<br />
...Only to miss as Jules sidestepped Rob&#39;s wobbly attack, and the newly buxom redhead collided with the cabinets behind the table with a high pitched &#39;oof!&#39; followed by a girlish squeal as Rob felt his right arm twist behind his back and then suddenly pain flared across his newly enlarged chest as he was pressed against the messy table and his free arm was pinned. His mane of red hair was across everything, it had knocked the take out bag off the table, it had draped itself across the un-spoiled half of the burger that...other him had divided up, there were stray toppings from the destroyed one curling into his locks as Rob unintentionally frenched the table as he struggled to free himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go!&quot; The bully whined as he struggled weakly against Jules&#39; grip. He couldn&#39;t stand how weak he was now, and he definitely didn&#39;t like the pressure of his lackey&#39;s crotch pressing against his rather bodacious butt. It felt horribly wrong...Yet some part of his mind could help but feel a little turned on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if you&#39;d fucking calm down!&quot; Jules hissed from behind. He was trying very hard not to get turned on, his member still throbbing from the dick-kick moments ago, but there was just not much hope as his sore johnson began to grow hard again as Rob wiggled against him in vain. Jules couldn&#39;t believe how easy it was to overpower Rob now. He would have NEVER been able to do this before! And he&#39;d watched Rob do it enough time to wannabe tough guys and other members of the gang that happened to smart off to the giant, and even Jules himself had been a victim of it twice. He&#39;d eventually picked up on how to do it himself. It was almost fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Whatever you did, fix it right now you little shitbag!&quot; Rob squealed again and struggled to lift himself up, only for Jules to double down on the pressure. He flailed some more and felt a strand of his new hair catch on something sticky...with promptly, with his squirming, flipped it right in his pretty face as the smell of mayonnaise filled his nostrils. He managed to crane his head back just enough to glare at Jules but farther behind his &#39;friend&#39; he saw the leering face of that old drunk fuck Frank as the older man peered out through the cheap plywood door of the master bedroom, a crooked, sloppy grin on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thatta boy!&quot; Frank chuckled to himself. He didn&#39;t mean to catch his son and Bobbi in the act but the loud noises and shaking from the kitchen had roused him from his near stupor. He&#39;d opened his bedroom door to see his son mounting the beauty on the kitchen table, and he couldn&#39;t help but grin as he stared.<br />
<br />
Then that...something happened again. The moment Rob made eye contact with Frank it was like a switch had flipped in his brain. His eyes took on a different shade of green as SHE opened for business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, harder baby!&quot; Bobbi moaned as she pressed herself against Jules&#39;s rock steady body. And cock. It felt SOOOO good against her, she just needed to have it! She bit her lower lip in anticipation as she began to grind against the throbbing rod in her lover&#39;s pants as her slit exploded with heat and wetness. She needed Jules, and she needed him now! Her fingers clenched in and out, her toes curled in her sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it to me daddy! Right now!&quot; She moaned as her body built towards ecstasy, the furnace between her legs radiating heat as she reared upwards to Jules&#39;s surprise, her back arched, her breasts swinging heavily to and fro as her body was wracked with desire...<br />
<br />
Frank had seen enough. Drunk as he was, he knew that as a father he shouldn&#39;t perv on his son and his girlfriend. He chuckled to himself and shut the custom built door, shambling back to his bed, his six pack of beer, and sports.<br />
<br />
Jules was at a loss of what the do, having been facing the wrong way and had not seen or heard his father making his presence known once more. Suddenly Rob had just switched over again, becoming the gorgeous girl that was clearly either just really horny, or madly in love with him. He had lessened his grip just enough for her to move, no longer trying to fight the raging member straining against his pants, a missile seeking the heat source that was grinding against it, instead the teenager was now trying to fight the mental urge to simply let go of Rob...Bobbi and rip his and hers pants off.<br />
<br />
&#39;Just...hold...on...&#39; The rational part in his mind struggled as it was slowly overtaken by his now raging sex drive, &#39;He could...turn back...any second!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Doit. Do it do it do it doit doitdoitDOITDOITDOIT!&#39; the larger portion of his brain screamed, and the right as he was about to give in, to rip off the thin barriers of fabric separating him from Bobbi, he felt her rocking form grow stiff and still once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy FUUUUUUUUCK!&quot; Rob screamed as HE took over once more. What was...What was happening!? What was this feeling!? It felt so...so good! Rob let out a heavy moan as his entire body shuddered violently in Jules&#39;s grip, and then he felt exhausted. He went limp, all his energy spent for the moment. His hair and breasts hung limply in the air and he panted heavily, a sharp, high pitched wheeze as he felt something wet in his new panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh...oh my GOD!&quot; Rob gasped, &quot;J...Just...Just let me go, I can&#39;t-fuckin&#39; can&#39;t breath&quot; Was all Rob could get out as he slumped lower towards the table.<br />
<br />
Jules hesitated, once again caught in the lurch as he struggled to understand what was happening. Why was Rob flipping back and forth between being his typical asshole self and what was clearly a girl that wanted nothing more than to fuck him!? How was any of this even real!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Please J! I&#39;m not...not gonna fight anymore. Please?&quot; Rob said more quietly, his voice taking on a begging quality to it that Jules had never heard before.<br />
<br />
Again Jules&#39; brain told him a variety of different things to do in the moment, but he ultimately went with letting go of Rob&#39;s arms and backing away slowly, his hands raised and muscles tensed just in case the buxom bully tried anything. Instead he just slumped against the table for a moment, wheezing like a very attractive fish before slowly pulling himself up and turning to face the dark haired boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, for the love of fucking god, tell me what you did to me J&quot; The redheaded woman pleaded again, her face twisted in confusion and what lookedl ike the edge of tears. She looked down at herself in disgust and reached a sweaty hand down to her jeans and pulled them away from her body, face twisting in revulsion at whatever she saw within.<br />
<br />
&#39;Should...Should I tell him? What if he just switches again in the middle of it? God I can&#39;t tell if this is the best or worst thing that&#39;s ever happened to me!&#39; Jules thought, and for a moment he considered simply running to his room, blocking the door and trying to find that magic Stone. But what if something else happened and Rob suddenly got strong again? The last thing Jules needed was to end up in a similar fate if Rob got his hands on that clearly magical artifact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, J!&quot; Rob begged again, and Jules made his decision. With a long sigh, the bully rubbed his face and looked at Rob&#39;s own.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I know, Rob, is that you had me on fleece patrol. I was waiting in the toilets by the club rooms at school and...&quot; Jules paused for a moment, taking another breath, &quot;...And then I said &#39;I wish I was home on my bed!&#39; and poof, here I was! And then there YOU were , looking like that! I can&#39;t fucking tell you what happened because I. DON&#39;T. KNOW! Ok!?&quot;Jules backed up a few steps, staring into Rob&#39;s harsh green eyes as they scrunched together. Good, he still &#39;looked like&#39; Rob.<br />
<br />
&#39;Huh, I guess eyes really ARE the windows into the soul!&#39; Part of him quipped, but he shoved it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tha doesn&#39;t make any fucking sense! Magic...Magic isn&#39;t fucking real! It&#39;s just something those faggots talk about when they play those faggy games!&quot; Rob hissed as he shifted his hips. The wet spot in his panties was growing cold and it felt, well, awful against his skin. God, this was the worst night of his life! Even worse than when his dad left! Jules HAD to be lying, the little shithead KNEW what happened! He hesitated!<br />
<br />
Rob summoned his strength and stood a little taller and took a single step towards Jules, trying his best to look intimidating in a body that was built to be anything BUT. &quot;Tell me what really happened! Tell me or I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll say you raped me!&quot; Rob threw out the only threat he could think of that might actually make Jules stumble a bit. There was no reason to threaten violence anymore, Rob just wouldn&#39;t be able to win.<br />
<br />
&quot;...What? Hey fuck you Little Mermaid! That&#39;s what happened! I sat there waiting for the clubs to end and then I said &#39;I wish I was home&#39; because I didn&#39;t WANT to be there! I lean back and poof, I&#39;m here and this insanity started! Maybe one of those little bastards got a hold of a real magic spell or something that changed you into this! Or maybe...Maybe Gloria Vanapolous had something to do with it! She was bitching to some other girl about her boyfriend, maybe she&#39;s a witch or some shit! All I know is I teleported home and you&#39;re standing in front of me looking like you&#39;re about to kiss me or something!&quot; Jules spalyed his arms wide and gave Rob the largest shrug that he could. It was the best excuse, but Jules wasn&#39;t going to reveal that magical rock. Not yet, at least. He&#39;d figure out if he still had it, if it still worked...And maybe he&#39;d have a little fun with it.</p>
