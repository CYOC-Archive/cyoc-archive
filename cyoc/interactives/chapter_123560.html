<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer Harper, now happily Jennifer Jenkins, and her new husband Harold/Harry spent their first night together as man and wife/werefox and werevixen under the stars in the woods surrounding the crescent shaped body of water the town of Moon Lake was named after.<br />
If questioned on the matter, both would admit to losing count as to the number of times they experienced from and gave pleasure to their life/soul mate, discovering a lot of ways that a fox and a vixen could physically couple together.<br />
The main thing was to celebrate their union and the start of their wedded bliss together, despite the fact that the wedding went somewhat as predicted, with her father James Harper Senior and the man he favored as Jenny&#39;s future husband Dieter Wilhelm arriving in town to drag Jenny back to Alabama and keep her from marrying Harry. A fact further complicated by Dieter&#39;s attempts to have Harry killed before the wedding.<br />
The shock of Dieter being arrested for his actions, along with Jenny—now more beautiful than before since joining were society—standing up to her father and reminding him that she was an adult and no longer under his thumb, caused James Senior to have a heart attack. Nothing anyone in Moon Lake wished for, but the matter was swiftly dealt with as Harper Senior was rushed to the hospital and is now currently in their Cardiac Intensive Care Unit in Critical Condition, after having suffered a second heart attack after being admitted.<br />
But Jenny and Harry were blissfully unaware of this, let alone the fact that her mother had now agreed to allowing her younger brother and sister emancipation, with Jenny to take custody and become their legal guardian. Of course, the fact that her mother was now capitulating to her older brother James Junior the same way she had to her husband for years was a matter that would have to be dealt with in time as well, but let&#39;s allow the newlyweds to enjoy the rest of their honeymoon...<br />
<br />
The werefox and his mate were curled up together under a tree, finally asleep for a moment after a long night of celebrating their marriage under the stars.<br />
It was sheer sexual exhaustion that finally overtook them.<br />
Some distance away from the happy couple, the Skulk security guard that Tachibana no Akane had privately assigned to keep an eye on them just to make sure no one and nothing interrupted their first night together, checked through his night vision binoculars and saw the smiles on their muzzles as they slept in each others furry arms.<br />
He knew that dawn was not far off, so if Jenny and Harry didn&#39;t wake up on their own and go back to the borrowed Skulk lake front cabin soon, that he&#39;d have to find a way to discretely wake them without revealing his presence.<br />
He had stayed far enough away to avoid actually seeing Harry and Jenny together, but that didn&#39;t keep his keen werefox ears from <i>hearing</i> them most of the night.<br />
<i>When I get home, my mate better be prepared to be ravished for the rest of today!</i> he thought, even as the man felt his hard vulpine penis twitch in hope of at least some relief, if not fun of its own.<br />
<br />
Jennifer Harper-Jenkins slept peacefully in her new husband&#39;s arms.<br />
For the first time in a long time, her dreams were totally happy.<br />
Jenny dreamed of the bright future ahead for her and her man.<br />
She would now study and eventually become Doctor Jennifer Jenkins, a therapist just like her mentor Doctor Frances Twist, while Harry would work his way up the ranks of the Moon Lake Fire Department to be at least a Captain, if not higher.<br />
Over the course of their extended lives together, they would also raise a whole passel of kits.<br />
But now Jenny found herself on a familiar dream road.<br />
She looked out from where she was last, and the storm was gone.<br />
There was nothing but blue skies and sunshine as far as she could see!<br />
But there was something she was looking for that there was no sign of.<br />
Yet.<br />
<i>Where are they?</i> Jenny wondered.<br />
<br />
In this dreamscape, she was totally naked and in her new human form, more shapely and beautiful than before the rogue werevixen Yvette Smith clawed her as a distraction to avoid being arrested for clawing William Anderson and trying to make him her mate. Her now longer blonde hair cascaded over her larger breasts but, like most of were society, Jenny had no qualms about being naked.<br />
Now New Jenny, as she was referred to here, was looking for the other two parts of her self. Plain Jenny, the woman she used to be, and Foxy Jenny, the beautiful werevixen she had become.<br />
Continuing to walk down the road past where she saw them last, New Jenny soon found her first clue.<br />
There was a sign on the path that hadn&#39;t been there before. It was hand made, just sticks and branches tied together by vines and driven into the ground on someone&#39;s attempt to make a stake. The lettering was definitely carved by somebody&#39;s paw.<br />
It read: ON THIS SPOT, 3 BECAME 1! and it was dated Halloween 2015, the date Jennifer Harper married Harold Jenkins and stood up to her father.<br />
New Jenny smiled upon reading it, and then she heard the giggling.<br />
Following the sound, Jenny walked off the path and through the treeline along the road.<br />
As she spotted a babbling brook, New Jenny also saw who she was looking for.<br />
But not the way she expected to find them.<br />
<br />
&quot;There she is!&quot; shouted Plain Jenny, after raising her head from where it was—between Foxy Jenny&#39;s furry legs—and seeing their other self.<br />
The fursona of Jennifer Harper-Jenkins was now able to turn her head and look to see what her friend and partner was talking about, because her muzzle was now no longer buried between Plain Jenny&#39;s legs since she was up and running towards New Jenny with a smile on her face.<br />
Jennifer looked at her old self as she approached, nude with open arms and a huge smile on her face.<br />
<i>My old self still couldn&#39;t beat Olive Oyl in a beauty contest,</i> New Jenny thought of her Plain past, <i>but she&#39;s as happy as can be. Just as I am,</i> as Plain Jenny embraced her self.<br />
&quot;Hey you!&quot; New Jenny gasped, while being hugged.<br />
&quot;Youdidit! Wedidit! We&#39;rewhole!&quot; yelled Plain Jenny excitedly, still hugging New Jenny, even as Foxy Jenny brushed herself off and came over to join the others.<br />
<i>Is that how I look in my fursona?</i> New Jenny wondered, watching the blonde furred vixen approach. <i>I&#39;ve never really stopped to take a good hard look at myself in a mirror furry. With those curves, bosom, and tail; Harry&#39;s right. I am beautiful.</i><br />
&quot;Hello Sister,&quot; Foxy Jenny said with a smile, as she hugged New Jenny.<br />
<i>The feeling of soft fur upon bare skin...</i> thought Jennifer, enjoying the sensation.<br />
&quot;So?&quot; New Jenny asked the others, now that Plain Jenny stopped hugging her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; her other selves said in unison.<br />
&quot;Sorry about our father, but everything will work out on the family front too, now that Dieter Wilhelm is in jail where he belongs,&quot; revealed Foxy Jenny.<br />
&quot;And obviously, we&#39;re complete at last,&quot; pointed out Plain Jenny, before hugging and kissing Foxy Jenny.<br />
&quot;I saw. Since when did you two...?&quot; wondered New Jenny.<br />
&quot;When you and Harry started your honeymoon, we decided to have ours, so to speak,&quot; said Foxy Jenny, taking Plain Jenny&#39;s hand in her paw. Something she was unable to do before yesterday morning.<br />
&quot;Care to join us?&quot; asked Plain Jenny, eyeing the naked form of New Jenny.<br />
&quot;Does this mean we, I mean, I&#39;m bi?&quot; wondered Jennifer, even as her other selves each grabbed one of her hands.<br />
&quot;Only when or if you want to be,&quot; said Foxy Jenny, even as she placed New Jenny&#39;s left hand upon one of her furry breasts. &quot;No obligations. Just another way of expressing joy, happiness, and love.&quot;<br />
&quot;After all, you had to do it with Yvette Smith to be at least physically complete from your... unplanned induction into were society,&quot; Plain Jenny reminded her, even as she moved her Sister&#39;s right hand to feel the moisture between her legs, since her bosom was barely an A Cup. &quot;Harry will always be your life/soul mate and the only man in your life. Except your sons—but obviously they don&#39;t count in regards to the topic at hand. You&#39;ll only love and care for them and your daughters as a mother should. Yet that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t come here and visit us every once in a while, or experience something different from time to time elsewhere,&quot; Plain Jenny added, referring to the world outside of dreams, before reaching forward long enough to tease one of New Jenny&#39;s nipples with her tongue as she started rubbing New Jenny&#39;s fingers against her very wet vagina folds.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; New Jenny said with a smile, before pulling the other two parts of her self closer to her for a group hug.<br />
Soon New Jenny found herself in an unique position, enjoying the tasty cream coming from the hidden depths between Foxy Jenny&#39;s legs even as her fursona was returning the favor by having her muzzle between Plain Jenny&#39;s legs once more, while her old self was showing New Jenny what a talented female tongue could do when properly applied.<br />
<br />
Harold Jenkins awoke with a smile on his muzzle.<br />
He had spent the first wonderful night of his new life with the woman he loved under the stars, expressing that love every way they physically could.<br />
Now he awoke to find Mrs. Jennifer Jenkins with her head between his legs, licking and sucking his vulpine cock to great hardness, even as her shapely ass was wiggling in front of him, her sexy tail twitching and teasing the tip of his muzzle.<br />
&quot;Good morning, Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; Harry said happily, taking in the sight before him.<br />
&quot;Good morning Mister Jenkins,&quot; the werevixen said between licks. &quot;There isn&#39;t much time left before dawn, so enjoy this early breakfast treat while you can before we have to go back to the cabin and avoid breaking the Public Display Laws, but I will definitely serve you the rest of breakfast and a whole lot more once we get there,&quot; Jenny said happily, before resuming her oral efforts on his hard cock.<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; said Harry, before licking the very wet cunt before him.<br />
Soon the werefox and his werevixen were yipping and howling in pleasure both given and received.<br />
Then the happy couple ran back to their borrowed cabin, paw in paw, as the werefoxes smiled at each other.<br />
There, Mister and Mrs. Jenkins would spend the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon enjoying their brief honeymoon together, before having to return to the house Harry grew up in and prepare to resume college classes on Monday and deal with the aftermath of James Harper Senior&#39;s heart attack(s) and get Janice and John Harper emancipated and into Jennifer&#39;s legal custody.</p>
