<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... You can take the costume off and return to your normal size but...&quot; your uncle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what Uncle John?&quot; you asked fearing the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your stuck as a girl for the rest of your life&quot; he answered winching. &quot;Your mom is going to kill me. I promised her that I wouldn't let you try on a costume that would change you more or less permanently. I didn't think I would have to worry about that since I only enchant the costumes to change someone's sex permanently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't get it&quot; you said a look of confusion on your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's simple&quot; your uncle said. &quot;If a male puts on a costume that's made for a female his sex will permanently change to female. The same happens if a female puts on a costume for a male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured that part out Uncle John&quot; you said a bit miffed that he thought you couldn't. &quot;What I meant was I don't get why you would promise Mom that. Do you mean that she knows that you're a wizard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she knows!&quot; your uncle said rather sharply. Calming down a bit he said &quot;I guess that your mother didn't tell you that she's a witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were stunned by this revelation so much that you stopped flapping your wings and you fell. You didn't fall far though as your uncle's hand shot out and caught you. You sat down on his hand and said &quot;She didn't tell me that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not surprised&quot; your uncle said. &quot;She doesn't make a big deal about her magic and doesn't really tell anyone that she's a witch. Though I would have thought that she would have told you. She should have told you.&quot; He said this last in a low growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do Uncle Jack?&quot; you ask in a whiny voice. &quot;I don't want to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there's nothing that can be done about that now&quot; he said. &quot;You'll just have to learn to live with being a girl. Fortunately most of your reality has changed so everyone remembers you as always being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even Mom and Dad?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; your uncle said. &quot;Though I'm going to return their memories so your mother can kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they remember me as a girl then you won't get into trouble&quot; you said. &quot;Just don't return their memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do that to your mother&quot; your uncle said shaking his head. &quot;Besides, she's a very perceptive woman. She'll notice that something is wrong and find out what it is. Once she does she'll be even angrier at me for trying to hide this. So angry that she may literally kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you reverse what you did to her memory will she know it?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh she will alright&quot; your uncle said. &quot;Then she would come here and probably turn me into a pig.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do it right away then&quot; you said. &quot;Mom and Dad deserve a nice little vacation by themselves. I don't want to ruin that for them. If they don't know that anything is wrong right now they can still enjoy their vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make a good point&quot; your uncle said. &quot;Alright, I'll hold off reversing the memory charm until their vacation is over. Once it's over though I will reverse it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough&quot; you said. &quot;Now how do I get this costume off? I think the wings are a part of my body now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they are&quot; your uncle replied chuckling. &quot;Though it's easy enough to take off. All you have to do is say costume revert and you will return to normal. However you don't want to do that until tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why's that?&quot; you asked perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you don't have clothes for your new female body here&quot; your uncle john explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;If reality altered to make me a girl then wouldn't my clothes have changed?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at home they should have changed&quot; your uncle said. &quot;Unless your mother put up wards against reality changes. Then they'll be your regular clothes. Hopefully she didn't put any up where they are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have those same wards up around your shop don't you&quot; you said a little crestfallen. You didn't want to stay in this form but if you don't have any clothes for a girl here then you would have to unless you wanted to wear your old clothes or go around naked. You couldn't go around naked with your uncle here and you doubt that your male clothes would fit you comfortably now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it&quot; your uncle said. &quot;I do have employees here you know. Janice will be in in the morning and she'll take your measurements and take you shopping for clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will I go shopping for clothes if I'm naked?!&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you'll go as you are now&quot; your uncle replied nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But won't that be weird?&quot; you asked. &quot;I mean people will try to catch me won't they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to worry&quot; your uncle said in a reassuring tone. &quot;People around here know of my magic and costumes. The most they'll do is ask you your name. I'll have to do a discovery spell to discover what your name is now but that won't be too difficult. We'll do that after dinner. Why don't you fly upstairs and I'll make dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Uncle Jack&quot; you said as you flap your wings and become airborne again.<br />
<br />
Before you got out of the changing room your uncle said &quot;Wait just a minute John. I forgot to mention something. There's another enchantment on the costumes to punish thieves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; you asked gulping afraid of the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;If someone leaves the store proper without paying then they become a costume themselves&quot; your uncle said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't have my money here with me!&quot; you said panicking.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a way around that&quot; your uncle said. &quot;I'm giving you that costume so you don't have to pay for it and the curse won't come into effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt a wave of relief wash over you. You wouldn't be changing into a costume if you went upstairs now. You were glad that your uncle gave you this costume since you liked flying. You had always dreamed of being able to fly which is probably why you picked this costumes in the first place. It was just a little perk in an otherwise sucky situation. &quot;Thanks Uncle Jack. I just hope that I don't lose any of the pieces since I like flying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't lose any of the pieces&quot; your uncle said chuckling. &quot;The costume is a part of you now. It will disappear when you return to normal or what's normal now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I get it back when I want to fly again?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say costume change while concentrating on the costume you want&quot; your uncle said. &quot;Since you only have one you really don't need to concentrate on it but it's good practice. I should tell you that from now on you don't have to take off your clothes when you change. Your costume will replace your clothes when you change into it and your clothes will replace your costume when you change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds cool&quot; you said. You begin thinking about what other costumes you could buy. Maybe if you wore a costume made for a male you would change back into your old self. You decided to ask your uncle if that could happen. &quot;Uncle Jack&quot; you said. &quot;If I wear a costume for a male will I change back into a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but you won't&quot; your uncle said shaking his head. &quot;I enchanted the costumes to change the sex of those who wanted it. The enchantment leaves a trace of itself in the person changed and this makes it unlikely for the person to change their sex back. You're a girl now and you'll stay a female for the rest of your life. Now let's go get dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you head upstairs you couldn't help but feel a little hope. Your uncle had said that it was unlikely that you'd become a boy again but he didn't say it was impossible. Somehow you'll find a way to change back. But would you want to change back if you had spent enough time as a girl that you had gotten used to it?</p>
