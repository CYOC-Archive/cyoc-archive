<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ahead lay a boring day for Tony with the track closed. Liz showed up on the off day. Tony was able to do a light workout, neither Liz or Tony wanted to risk aggravating his fetlock injury, which was healing quickly. <br />
<br />
Tony stayed out of his stall to assist with Amaranth. Her training went quite well. Tobias was optimistic he could improve the finish 1 place in the next few races. <br />
<br />
Once again Tony had a strange experience with Amaranth. He stood holding her reins while Liz and Tobias went over some things for the next race. Tony stood stroking Amaranth&#39;s muzzle when he heard in his head, &quot;You smell nice&quot;, which was quickly followed by a face lick from Amaranth.<br />
<br />
Liz and Tobias stopped their conversation upon hearing Tony say, &quot;I must be going insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong Tony?&quot; Liz was concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, the last few times I&#39;ve handled Amaranth I swear I&#39;ve heard a voice in my head.&quot; Tony responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did the voice say?&quot;, Liz asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell nice.&quot; That got a laugh from Tobias. Liz shook her head and massaged her temple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony, not sure how to break this to you, but I think she wants you to breed her.&quot; Tobias was chuckling, but stopped when Liz shot him a reproachful look. Tony for his part looked a little shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tobias, take Amaranth back to her stall. I need to speak with Tony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right away ma&#39;am. Come on girl.&quot; Tobias clicked his tongue and Amaranth followed Tobias back to the barn while Liz and Tony adjourned off to the side of the training track.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony, there is an empathic phenomenon that sometimes develops with breeders where an empathic link with horses can be established. I&#39;ve always heard that it was limited to sensing emotions. You say you&#39;ve heard words?&quot; If Liz was right, this was a new unknown ability that could be very useful down the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it happened the first time in Amaranth&#39;s stall before her race. I heard, &#39;missed you&#39;. Is this because we spent all the time together in the trailer?&quot; Tony had never anticipated anything like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly Tony I don&#39;t know. This sounds like something that hasn&#39;t been reported before. You did get multiple breeder sessions in addition to the racer modifications. That&#39;s very unusual, possibly unique. It&#39;s possible that&#39;s what has caused this ability to develop. That said, Tobias may be right about her wanting you to breed her.&quot; Liz couldn&#39;t believe this conversation. &quot;You are a stallion and a breeder. If she gets too uptight, we may have to let you breed her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; The prospect of sex with a female horse suddenly became quite real for Tony. He expected that would be his life way down the line, but here it was before him. Tony shrugged. &quot;I suppose I&#39;m flattered she considers me breeding material. If it needs to happen I will happily breed her. I knew sex with a female horse was destined sooner or later. I just didn&#39;t expect it this soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a word about this to anyone else, especially here at the track. I need to talk with Max about this and figure out how we want to deal with it going forward. We&#39;ll talk about this again in a few days.&quot; Liz ruffled Tony&#39;s mane. &quot;Let&#39;s get you back in your stall. Good luck tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony grinned, &quot;Expect a much better finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
It was early in the day, and Tony was already in the starting gate. As he did in the prior race he carved small divots in the track and braced for a runner&#39;s take-off. This time he had no prison ponies next to him, instead he was flanked by Micah&#39;s Mount and Thunderflash. Micha&#39;s Mount was snow white from head to hoof and quite striking. Thunderflash was chocolate brown and built like a thoroughbred. He nodded to both of them as they were put in post order and they smiled in return. Whatever happened Tony decided this would be a clean race on his part anyways.<br />
<br />
&quot;On your marks...&quot; The gate slammed open and Tony was sprinting through it instantly. No errant hooves came his way. The field condensed and closed on the rail. Tony was in 5th breaking from the gate. The herd thundered down the front stretch. Tony heard a surprised equine scream behind him, the crowd roared, but Tony ignored it. More dirty tricks no doubt. Tony turned up the speed as the turn approached. Thunderflash was trying to pass on his outside. No way. Tony went a little wide and cranked his speed up more. On the back stretch Tony and Thunderflash were running together neck and neck on the outside, passing other ponies in the process. By the time they hit the front stretch again only the leader was in front of them with the finish fast approaching. Tony and Thunderflash both picked up the pace even more and passed the leader with only 20 yards to go. Tony knew he would have to throw everything at this to pull it out. He pulled an old runner&#39;s trick and dove at the line. He crashed and burned, but no one ran him over. <br />
<br />
After the other ponies crossed the line his assigned groomsman came out on the track and helped him up before snapping on a lead. The other ponies were lead off, but the grooms were holding Tony and Thunderflash on the track. The crowd was murmuring restlessly. Thunderflash and Tony looked on nervously. Their tails were agitated and moving in sticcato fashion. That&#39;s when Tony noticed the scoreboard, &quot;Race Under Review, Photo Finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony turned to Thunderflash, &quot;Great race, we should do that again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thunderflash relaxed, grinned and nodded, &quot;You&#39;re good, I want another shot. Diving at the line,...you got balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony laughed, as the results appeared on the scoreboard...Tony Pony 1st by a nose. The finish photo appeared on the big screen showing Tony horizontal in mid-air crossing the line. The crowd roared,<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations&quot;, Thunderflash called. &quot;Get a copy of that picture for the scrapbook. Ha ha.&quot; With a wave of his hard Thunderflash was lead off.<br />
<br />
Tony was lead a different direction, to the winner&#39;s circle.</p>
