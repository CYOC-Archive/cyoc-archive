<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bus&#39;s next stop was at my school.  As I made my way into the building, I had more questions than answers.  Did that actually just happen? How did that happen? Was I dreaming? Where did I get this power?  What were its limits? Would I lose it? Arriving at my locker, I decided that none of them mattered, I had a gift and I was going to use it while <br />
I had it. <br />
<br />
I examined myself in the mirror at the back of my locker. I wasn&#39;t bad looking, or at least I didn&#39;t think so.  I was 14, and at 5&#39; 7&quot; and 110 pounds, I was definitely scrawny. I could use some time in the gym but I was way to nervous to go. My blue eyes peaked out past my long brown hair, I pushed it back and smiled at myself.  I had lingered too long and given Doug his opportunity.  Doug checked me into my locker hard with his shoulder and called me a fag as he continued down the hallway. <br />
<br />
Doug lives to make peoples lives miserable, especially mine.  He was 17, 6&#39; tall, with buzzed blonde hair and plenty of muscles.  Doug would have made a great jock, but he claimed sports were &#39;gay&#39;.  Several times a week Doug went out of his way to find me and inflict some punishment.   He took real pleasure in inflicting both emotional and physical pain on me.  Normally I would have just picked myself up and been thankful it hadn&#39;t been worse, but today was going to be different.  I grabbed my book headed off to Biology, which I just happened to have with Doug.<br />
<br />
As I arrived in class, I took a seat a few rows behind Doug and one to the side.  Because this was his second time through Biology, Doug had to sit in the front row and I wanted to be able to see my work.  The teacher, Mr. Grier, was on older man who was clearly riding out his time until retirement.  He handed out a worksheet, told us to work on it quietly, and proceeded to doze off at his desk in the front of the class.  Normally I would have been all over the worksheet but there was no way I was going to be able to concentrate on it today. I kept my head down, but my eyes locked on Doug.  <br />
<br />
I tried to do everything like I had on the bus. I focused hard on reaching out with my mind and grabbing Doug&#39;s shoe laces.  I watched as the know on his left shoe slowly came undone. I could feel the fabric of the lace in this new appendage of mine, I could feel the tension in the knot as it released.  Doug was none the wiser as I took the now free left lace and tied it to his right shoe lace.  I wasn&#39;t going to stop there though.  I slid my minds hand up up his leg feeling Doug&#39;s leg hair on the way up to his knee. Doug looked to see what was grazing up against him but was a little dumbfounded when there was nothing there. I slid my hand past his knee over his thigh and towards his package.  Doug was more than a little confused, he grabbed twice at his thigh trying to stop the slow moving object heading right towards his dick, but came up with nothing, there was nothing there, but he could feel it.  Doug was starting to panic a little now as my invisible hand made it to its destination.<br />
<br />
I had to keep myself from laughing out loud.  Doug had the smallest penis I&#39;d ever seen, well felt, well kind of felt.  As I rolled it around it stiffened to its maximum length of a little over 3&quot;, sticking straight up from two golf ball sized balls. I could feel that Doug shaved his pubic hair, probably trying to make his pathetic manhood seem bigger.  It all made sense now why Doug didn&#39;t play sports, he didn&#39;t want to anyone to find out about his little bitty peepee.  It also went a long way to explaining why he was such an asshole, overcompensating for his own short comings.  I decided it was time for the world to meet little Dougie. <br />
<br />
I took my hand and moved it to Doug&#39;s ass, forcing my finger into his tight hole.  Doug popped out of his chair with a yelp, frantically scanning his chair and then the class for what was causing this.  He clawed at the back of his pants trying to remove me from inside him.  I pulled out and quickly moved around front unbuttoning his jeans and pulling them and his underwear down to his ankles.  Everything had happened so quickly the other people in the class hadn&#39;t had time to react, Mr. Grier hadn&#39;t even fully woken up yet.  Most of the people in the class had been terrorized by Doug before, so there was a delayed response to what was happening, they were afraid.  Then the giggles started Doug was desperately trying to get his pants up but I kept them down for everyone to take in.  Some cell phones popped up, people were filming.  I let go of Doug&#39;s pants and the effort he was putting into pulling them up sent him flying backwards.  Laying on his back now still trying to get his pants up Doug looked on the verge of tears as the whole class was now laughing.  Mr. Greer was now awake and yelling at Doug, confused as to why the boy had taken his pants off in the first place.  Doug was desperately trying to leave the class but his tied together laces kept him tripping eventually he kicked them off and went running down the hall.</p>
