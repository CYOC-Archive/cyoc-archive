<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janessa paused kneading the dough that would be part of that night’s dinner.  A strange feeling came over her, making the hairs on the back of her neck rise.  She sighed.<br />
<br />
“Astra, Alma, Alta, stop practicing magic in the house without your father!” she called.  Immediately, the feeling went away.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, mother!” shouted her triplet daughters.  Janessa shook her head and resumed kneading the dough.  Footsteps sounded in the living room, the front door slammed open.<br />
<br />
“No running in the house, Brittany and Bry!” Janessa shouted.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, mother!” replied her twin daughters.<br />
<br />
“Be careful playing outside.”<br />
<br />
“We will!” the twins said.  The door closed.  Janessa sighed, but with more amusement than exasperation.  She held her wetnurse position through her pregnancy with the triplets, but when she became pregnant with the twins, she stepped away to become a full-time stay-at-home mother.  It was a change in career she was more than pleased with.  She had gotten tired of tending to the royal children, knowing that her own were waiting for her at home.  And having a nanny was getting cost prohibitive for her and Yevgeny.<br />
<br />
At least, that was the case until Yevgeny was promoted to his current role on the King’s Council.  Now, they made enough money for as many nannies as they wished.  But Janessa continued to stay home.  She liked taking care of the house and the many children.  Since she gave birth to the septuplets, she had been pregnant eight more times.  She and Yevgeny did their best to hold off on activities that would result in children after the septuplets were born, as they wanted to give the fertility charm time to leave her system.  Alas, she had still become pregnant with triplets, then with twins.  Each pregnancy after, however, was thankfully a singleton.<br />
<br />
Now, Janessa and Yevgeny were raising twelve children.  The sixteen-year-old triplets, the fourteen-year-old twins, twelve-year-old Collie, ten-year-old Dryada, eight-year-old Enid, six-year-old Fria, four-year-old Gloriette, two-year-old Helve, and newborn Iridia.  All were daughters, which meant they did not need to be smuggled away to be raised by loyalists in safety.  Janessa was relieved by this.  It broke her heart to send her septuplets away and watch her octuplets grow up without her.<br />
<br />
Janessa rubbed her flat stomach ruefully.  She had only given birth to Iridia a month ago, but was already back to her perfect concubine’s figure.  And she was already missing being pregnant.  After spending so much time being pregnant, giving birth, and nursing children, it had become something she genuinely enjoyed.  As the eighteenth birthday of the septuplets was approaching, however, she knew that she and Yevgeny needed to hold off on any more children.  The war would be revived in severity and she might be forced to return to her old identity as Prince Jasper to lead the revolt.<br />
<br />
Iridia began to wail from her bassinette.  Janessa hurriedly washed her hands and picked up her newborn daughter.  Iridia made suckling motions with her lips.  Janessa uncovered her large, perfect breasts.  Iridia latched onto the offered nipple eagerly and began to drink.  Janessa stroked her daughter’s wispy red hair.  Of the twelve children she was raising, only Iridia, Collie, and Dryada had the rich red hair of the Royal Family.  The other nine had Yevgeny’s blonde hair, and thus, were witches.  Thanks to how much magic she was exposed to, Janessa had developed a sixth sense that let her know when her magical children were using their powers without supervision.  It was very useful and prevented many messy accidents.<br />
<br />
The front door opened.  Footsteps sounded.  Yevgeny walked into the kitchen.  Janessa perked up at the sight of her husband.  Yevgeny smiled warmly at his wife.<br />
<br />
“Hello, my love,” he purred.  He walked to Janessa and kissed her forehead.  “How are you?”<br />
<br />
“Fine.”<br />
<br />
“You need no help with the children?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Janessa scoffed.  “They are far easier than anything I did in life before becoming a stay-at-home mother.”  Yevgeny chuckled.  “You are home early.”<br />
<br />
“I have news.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?”<br />
<br />
“To celebrate his sons’ nineteenth birthday, King Antyny is holding a tournament for anyone in the kingdom to attend.  It will take place the day before the septuplets’ birthday.”<br />
<br />
“I see.”  Janessa frowned thoughtfully.  “Perhaps we should spread this news to Anya and the others.  It might provide the perfect opportunity.”  Yevgeny nodded.<br />
<br />
“I agree.  We must all gather here at the Capitol.  When the princes become princesses, our sons can take the throne back in the chaos, and our forces can support the effort.”  Yevgeny stroked Janessa’s hair.  “I fear, my love, that when Anya comes with the others…”<br />
<br />
“…I will become Jasper again,” Janessa said softly.  She nodded.  “I know.  But I will do what is right for the kingdom, not what is right for me.  And, my dear husband, no matter what form I take, I will always love you.  You are my soulmate.”  Yevgeny lowered his face to kiss Janessa.<br />
<br />
“And you are mine,” he said gently.  “Perhaps you can return to Janessa, once one of our sons is on the throne.”<br />
<br />
“That is what I hope for.”  Janessa sighed wistfully.  “I cannot wait to see our sons, how they have grown.”<br />
<br />
“I will tell the others of our plan,” Yevgeny said.  “And we shall both see our sons in a mere few months.”</p>
