<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul headed for the home gym. It was one of the nicest parts of having a rich father. Even if his dad didn&#39;t use it as much as him, he always would have a place to work out and all the equipment he could ever need. Even a small shower room right next to it, so he could easily change and get cleaned up afterwards. Paul tossed the clothes he was wearing into the hamper and grabbed the sleeveless shirt and shorts that he normally worked out in. <br />
<br />
They were far more comfortable and he loved seeing his large arms while he worked out. They were nothing like his father&#39;s though. The older man wasn&#39;t small by most people&#39;s standards. At 6&#39;2&quot; and a good 200 pounds he had a good lean but moderately built frame. Paul had always been a little bit jealous of that. His dad&#39;s muscles could easily be seen whenever they had pool parties. The little bit of fat on his body really made it easy to see that he was still pretty strong. But seeing just how dedicated his old man was to eating as healthy of a diet as possible, he also didn&#39;t want to have to put himself through that either. He enjoyed being able to go out on the weekends and party with his friends without having to say, &quot;I can&#39;t drink that because it has too many calories.&quot; Maybe next year when he was in college he&#39;d start thinking about it a bit more, but right now he was perfectly fine with his extra bulk.<br />
<br />
Besides, it helped him out on the field. Paul had almost always be one of the biggest guys out there. But he couldn&#39;t help but want to get bigger. Anytime he&#39;d face off against someone who was just a bit bigger than him, he&#39;d grit his teeth in frustration. It was all genetics. His dad was a big dude, and Paul was bigger, but that didn&#39;t quell his desire to be even bigger. It was something he&#39;d always wanted. Something he&#39;d still been striving for. Yet, his growth spurt seemed to have stopped. His body just wouldn&#39;t give him those couple extra inches to be a giant on the field.<br />
<br />
Paul started off his workout pretty light. Making sure that he stretched enough to properly get his blood flowing. It was his least favorite part, but right now he felt a bit more flexible that usual. When he stretched his legs, his hands were able to press flat against the floor. And his body just seemed to move easily through each of the movements. Normally he&#39;d have to force himself into positions through his bulk, yet his body almost felt like it was already warmed up.<br />
<br />
Taking it as a blessing, Paul started with the next part of his workout. He went over to the dumbbell rack and picked up the usual 50 pound dumbbells. He pumped through 12 reps. &quot;What the hell?&quot; he looked down at the weights making sure it was actually the 50 pound ones. His dad rarely ever went up that high, but Paul had been known to accidently switch the lighter weights from time to time. But they were in fact 50 pound dumbbells. <br />
<br />
&quot;Strange..?&quot; Paul muttered to himself. They felt far lighter that usual. The tension in his arms just wasn&#39;t there as he went through another 12 reps. If anything it almost felt lighter. He went up to the 60 pound ones. That felt better. Still a little light, but definitely better. <br />
<br />
Paul went through the rest of his workout. Each time he&#39;d start an exercise he&#39;d feel like he needed to add another 10 or 15 pounds for it to really feel right. But looking in the full length mirrors that surrounded the gym, his body seemed to think otherwise. There was a definitive pump running through his body. Even without showing off he could tell the difference in his arms as beads of sweat ran down them. His chest looked fully, pushing harder against his sleeveless shirt. And that added size seemed to run all the way down to his feet, that currently felt a bit tight in his size 13 shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good,&quot; he smirked to himself. He flexed his body watching the muscles tighten and bulge. They were noticeably bigger than they had been before. &quot;Don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever felt this good after a workout.&quot; He switched to a different position, checking out more of his body. &quot;Wonder what Jeff will think?&quot; A different smile filled his face as he thought about his friend. He could feel his heart pump a little bit faster as he thought about Jeff coming down to look at him. With that faster beating heart, blood was able to fill a different organ between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what the hell?!&quot; Paul quickly swatted at his excited cock. It only seemed to turn him on more. &quot;Stop that,&quot; he scolded himself and went back to flexing in order to move the blood to a different position. However, under his embarrassment, he hadn&#39;t noticed that it was slightly larger than it had been before. The 5 inches of meat he was normally packing had added on an inch. <br />
<br />
Paul tried to distract himself from the weird thoughts he was having. &quot;Where is Jeff?&quot; he questioned.</p>
