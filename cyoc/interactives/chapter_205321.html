<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sabrina had reported her rape to the police. They had lots of fingerprints and DNA, however the DNA was troubling. The lab came back and said that they had found a mixture of human and canine DNA in the sperm of the rapist. They had also asked for a sample of Sabrina&#39;s DNA and she had come back with canine traits. It made it impossible to use for comparison to human DNA databases. Only if they caught the rapist directly could they compare DNA.<br />
<br />
Sabrina was doing a photo shoot with Hannah but suddenly the blonde bitch wasn&#39;t available. Sab had managed to get a new girl into the scene. Summer, aka Sum, was half black/white, a lot like Rhianna or Zoë Kravitz. But she had a body like Kim K, what she lacked in height, 5-5, her DD chest and her weight of 121 lbs put her in the same category as height and weight as Hannah. She had worked her way up through the porn scene a lot like Sab was still doing bits of. <br />
<br />
Sab and Sum were doing what is called twinning, where two models wear the same bikini and act like twins. Sum was wearing a spare set of Sab&#39;s bikini. A two piece, hot pink. The difference was how Sab wore it, it cupped her boobs and showed her nipples leaving nothing to the imagination. The way that Sum wore it her boob flesh spilled around the fabric. Like a muffin comes over the top of paper wrap. She had had to tuck her nipples into the think fabric. <br />
<br />
Sab was reminded of those models, who did topless shots but while wearing a pair of suspenders over their nipples to not be called topless so they could post online. She looked at Sum&#39;s huge tits and imagined with one of her nails a small nick to the understrap would break her DD cups free of the fabric. With her darkened skin, jet black hair and brown eyes Sum could claim to be a bigger version of Sab. <br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK!&quot; Sab grunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Sum asked<br />
<br />
Sab felt a sharp pain in her belly, she felt dizzy and a strong desire to be sick she gripped the edge of the wooden bench so that she didn&#39;t fall over. Summer could see that Sabrina&#39;s face was almost as white as that bitch Hannah&#39;s. She was gripping the bench so hard that her knuckles were white as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you OK?&quot; Sum asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I, I...oh no.&quot; she remembered the stranger in her apartment. <br />
<br />
A hand went to her belly as her breasts began to tingle. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go to the toilet.&quot; she ran.<br />
<br />
As she ran her breasts tingled madly, her nipples turned a darker shade of brown. She tried to adjust the straps as she ran to the bathroom she tried to adjust the straps of her bikini. Her fleshy orbs swelled like some kind of Japanese anime. She pulled on a pair of jeans that seemed to catch her around her hips. A faint brown line appeared along her stomach as she ran to the bathroom. An experience that all pregnant women shared in she was vomiting into a toilet bowl. She knew what had happened and somehow it was linked to Hannah and her rape that the cops were still investigating.<br />
<br />
Summer came with her, &quot;Look, Sab! It&#39;s... it&#39;s getting worse!&quot; she whimpered while she unsnapped her bikini top to release the pressure. The two orbs spilled on her chest, the areola visibly puffed up around long nipples.<br />
Sab felt her breasts and they were swollen orbs that did not belong to her. Summer seemed to be picking up on this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you like pregnant or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was raped.&quot;<br />
<br />
Summer gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to have an abortion, can&#39;t have that motherfucker&#39;s baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sabrina looked at Summer with tears running down her cheek and onto the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that easy and it&#39;s not because I am Catholic.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lifted her breasts and they felt so heavy that they lay sagging on her chest, still perky but their weight and gravity meant she had a rack like Hannah&#39;s. Her nipples were still up turned. She poked and prodded her stomach.  <br />
<br />
Across town Hannah was rubbing her tits and pussy against a mirror, to achieve an orgasm. This then reached to Sabrina he was carrying a half brother or sister to Max&#39;s baby. <br />
<br />
“Haah... Uugh.. Aaah...WooF!&quot; she half moaned/barked as she climaxed in sync with Hannah. <br />
<br />
She hit the ground, her breasts wobbling like mounds of jello as she hit the floor. Summer danced backward, her hands covering her mouth. Sabrina started rubbing her nipples and pussy against a hard surface that Summer couldn&#39;t see but Sab could feel it. As she was feeling what Hannah was doing via the curse that had marked them both. <br />
<br />
Her belly surged forward until it was exact twin of Hannah&#39;s pregnancy. Sabrina sob quietly as she felt a lull before an invisible, but very real, dog cock enter her vagina. Summer put her hand on the belly and a hardness started to form under one hard point that then spread out from her palm. Then over the size of both hands. Summer watched slacked jawed as her friend&#39;s belly grew. Sabrina tried to suck it in but it did exactly what her womb was built to do, it rose outwards beyond the line of her stomach. With her breathing of chest her breasts got even more engorged. Blue veins criss-crossed her boobs, blood rushed to her glands to support feeding a new life. Her hips bucked as she felt Hannah&#39;s orgasm building inside her, she didn&#39;t notice in her trance like state her hips cracking and her ass plumping up. Her bikini bottom became a thong and then rubbed down as her jeans rode down the length of her shapely legs. Her shaved mound was exposed to the air.<br />
 <br />
&quot;¡Madre de Dios!&quot; she screamed as the pain and pleasure mixed.<br />
<br />
She was from a Cuban family and Spanish was her main and often her earliest language. Like Hannah, the walls of her vagina gripped the invisible cock and felt the warm spurt canine seed. <br />
<br />
After a lot of crying. Summer helped get Sabrina dressed using her own bikini top as a bar. Now Sab&#39;s chest matched that of Sum&#39;s. Her nipples were shown by the dark brown circles that made up her nipples and the deep blue veins that traced the swelled mammary glands.</p>
