<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Agent reed watches Sheriff Cooper twist his face into an unpleasant sneer; having to suppress a giggle as she too puts on a stony façade, The Agent enters the interview room with Sheriff Cooper following her along like he was forced to lick the underside of a smelly jock strap.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Agent Reed staring at Frederick parker; “when the sheriff said he’d have Daniel in here waiting for me, he never said you were present. Here to confess and make my job easier?”<br />
“Fuck you bitch,” Daniel glaring at the FBI agent; “I’m in consult with my lawyer. Get out.”<br />
“This ambulance chaser is your lawyer,” Agent Reed looking at man sitting across from the Parkers; “I figured with the money your father squirrelled away, he could afford O.J Simpson’s defense team.”<br />
“How droll,” Frederick staring at the woman. Seeing her large and voluptuous figure, barely being contained in her rather provocative attire. The mobster had to shift uncomfortably in his seat as his own body betrayed him by getting aroused.<br />
“Here is a extradition order for escorting Daniel Parker back to San-Francisco,” Agent Reed tossing a document on the table. Sheriff Cooper,” Agent Reed not even bothering to look at the man; “you did receive that phone call from my director, expecting your full co-operation now.”<br />
“Don’t remind me,” Sheriff Cooper looking sour; “but that doesn’t mean the town’s prosecutor will not fight the order. Jack Johnson is all set to try Daniel Parker for his crimes here in town.”<br />
“The FBI considers its R.I.C.O case far more important,” Agent Reed smirking; &quot;then attempted murder and grand theft auto. But if it makes you feel any better,” Agent Reed grinning at the Parker’s; “If Daniel doesn’t co-operate, we can always try him for those crimes in San-Francisco. What better place for him to get an impartial jury.”<br />
“We’ll see you in court,” P. Mason snorting at the FBI agent; “and any deal the FBI wants to provide must come with full immunity.”<br />
“Sheriff Cooper,” Agent Reed looking serious; “make yourself useful, get me a cup of coffee, with two creams.”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper just glares as he tries to win at a staring contest with the FBI agent Brooke Reed. Seeing as she wasn’t going to back down he just swears as he leaves the room; yet he doesn’t head to the coffee machine, Sheriff Cooper heads to the room next to the interview room to view what Agent Reed say next.<br />
“Now that the Sheriff is gone,” Agent Reed tossing a dossier on the table; “let’s talk about Chelnik.”<br />
<br />
Frederick Parker nearly chokes as he stares at the woman before him. Impressed that she had the moxie to intimidate and bully the large Sheriff in his own house; he nearly swears as she drastically switched the subject from his son to his “problem solver.”<br />
“I don’t know who you are talking about,” Frederick trying to display his best poker face.<br />
“You mean this man,” Agent Reed display a photo of Frederick with a man in dark shades behind him; an obvious surveillance photo. “What about this picture,” Agent Reed showing Frederick another photo of Chelnik only younger and seen pointing a gun at an elderly woman in bombed out town. “Chelnik Valdomir is a man under your employ,” Agent Reed staring at Frederick Parker; “it’s no use denying it. What you need to answer to me is did you know of his past? That he is wanted war criminal?”<br />
“I have no idea where the man is,” Frederick lying; “he never accompanied me to here when I left from San-Francisco.”<br />
“Really,” Agent Reed knowing the man was lying but choosing not call him out on it; “I hope you can convince the CIA and NSA when they ask you about Chelnik. Apparently,” Agent Reed being truthful; “those agencies are all in an uproar and are on their way here when they found out he was hiding in California and hanging around you.”<br />
“Why would they want to talk to me,” Frederick now looking extremely concerned.<br />
<br />
Agent Reed just grins as she shows the photo of him and Chelnik in the background yet again. “The CIA and NSA have some of the best facial recognition software to date,” Agent Reed answering; “couple that with a warrant for his arrest curtesy of Interpol, and… Well you’re a smart man,” Agent Reed smile getting bigger; “I’m sure you can figure out the rest.”<br />
<br />
Frederick mind was going a mile a minute. Yes he knew Chelnik had a past; the man telling him he was ex-Spetsnaz, lent credence to his skills. Yet the man was always secretive about his past. Frederick knew that if Agent Reed was telling the truth; even he was going to have a hell of a time evading two of America’s largest spy agencies.<br />
“I say again,” Frederick speaking in a low fashion; “I have no idea where Chelnik is, nor did I have any idea about his past other than being from Eastern Europe. Now if you are done,” Frederick trying to muster some of his usual bluster; “we are busy discussing my son’s legal issues with this lawyer. Now leave us!”<br />
<br />
Agent Reed calmly picks up her dossier and leaves the interview room; high tailing it to the observation room that Sheriff Cooper is in, Agent Reed takes a big breath as she looks at the were-grizzly shaking his head and chuckling softly.<br />
“God dam,” Sheriff Cooper smiling; “if you weren’t acting back there, I’d swear you truly got under my skin with that whole coffee bit.”<br />
“It now gives them something to consider,” Agent Reed staring at the room and watching Frederick ranting and raving; “it’s a pity we can’t listen in to what he is saying. What I just told him must be making the man freak out for the first time.”<br />
“Well technically,” Sheriff Cooper chuckling; “the slick kid there is an actual attorney; using the name of a fictional character as an alias however does question his credibility.”<br />
“Pedro Juarez,” Agent Reed chuckling; “originally hailing from El-Paso Texas. He graduated from a community college in Las-Vegas and did start his law career chasing ambulances.”<br />
“Ha,” Sheriff Cooper laughing; “anything you FBI don’t know?”<br />
“Jimmy Hoffa’s resting place,” Agent Reed answering flatly.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Frederick Parker watched Agent Reed leave the interview room before blowing up; feeling a sense of unbridled rage as he knows Chelnik just became a liability to him, the man feverishly tries to call him. Getting nothing but a voicemail, Frederick Parker throws his phone across the room, causing it to shatter and break in many pieces.<br />
“Was that necessary dad,” Daniel watching his father’s fit; “how will you be able to get ahold of the men that are going to spring me?”<br />
“I don’t,” Frederick fuming; “Pedro here does.”<br />
“Slight problem,” Pedro looking serious; “the off shore account that had my fee was closed. Or did you forget that bit of information I gave you earlier.”<br />
“I haven’t,” Frederick seething; “and I promise you, I’ll look into that. But you agreed to this charade, so I expect you to see it through.”<br />
“Then we better wrap this up,” Pedro stares at the Parkers; “lest the bumpkin sheriff and striperella get wise to us.”<br />
“Daniel,” Frederick looking at his son; “just sit tight and try to keep a low profile. Come Tuesday, you’ll be free of this hick town police station and at your uncle’s in British Colombia. But I’m warning you,” Frederick glaring at his son; “when I say keep a low profile, you dam well better this time. Because if you fuck up again, I just might not lift a finger to help you a second time.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
“Looks like they are done” Agent Reed observing through the one way mirror.<br />
“You didn’t tell Frederick that Chelnik is dead,” Sheriff Cooper looking at Agent Reed.<br />
“If we are to sell the scenario that Chelnik got taken out by one of Frederick’s enemies,” Agent Reed responds; “then he must still think the man is alive. It won’t be long before the man figures out something is amiss,” Agent Reed speaking; “while I did tell Frederick that the NSA and CIA do want Chelnik for war crimes, and the man might suspect he got caught and sent to a black site prison…”<br />
“Tachibana and the skulk,” Sheriff Cooper finishing the statement; “will make it look like the man got rubbed out by a rival of Frederick’s.”<br />
And since Frederick claimed Chelnik never joined him here,” Agent Reed grinning; “we can keep Chelnik’s body on ice for the time.”<br />
“Thus making those agencies look elsewhere for the man,” Sheriff Cooper sighing; “I hope we are doing the right thing.”<br />
“It’s to keep the town’s secret safe,” Agent Reed answering; “and the existence of were’s a secret as well. Of course we are doing the right thing.”</p>
