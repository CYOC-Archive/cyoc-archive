<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to be your apprentice&quot; Vinnie said after a few minutes of deliberation. Rafe was clearly a lot more powerful than Vinnie and if he were to overpower him he&#39;d have done it by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, pick up Horst and Carter and step into my office.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie looked down sadly at his new friends. Rafe did not miss his guilty expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rest assured, Horst and Carter were not your friends.&quot; Rafe spoke knowingly, &quot;They only wanted access to your power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie looked doubtful.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t believe me then put them on and try diving into their memories.&quot; Rafe challenged,  &quot;Take a look at what they did between the time they witnessed your magic and when they attempted to befriend you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie eyed the socks warily. It seemed like a major invasion of privacy but curiosity got the better of him. He slipped them on and closed his eyes. Immediately a memory began to swim before him. The more Horst and Carter desperately tried not to think about it the more vivid it became.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
&quot;Hey what are we going to do about that Vince guy?&quot; Horst asked Carter after school yesterday. &quot;Reckon we should beat him up until he changes Ryan back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm I dunno, he might try to do something to us,&quot; Carter pondered &quot;Could you imagine if we had that kind of power, think of the possibilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
Horst&#39;s mind had immediately gone to some filthy and vile thoughts while Carter imagined himself finally ruling the school after being in Ryan&#39;s shadow for so long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea but how would we go about taking it from him?&quot; Horst asked, cock stiffening at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we pretend to be his friend?&quot; Carter thought aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think he&#39;ll fall for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The guys a nerd and a loser.&quot; Carter sneered. &quot;Nobody likes him so he&#39;s probably desperate for friends. Maybe we can get him to perform magic for us. You seen the way some of those dorks bend over backwards at a chance at being Ryan&#39;s friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha let&#39;s invite him to our weekly beer and jack-off party tomorrow&quot; Horst said excitedly &quot;The loser probably never even had anyone touch his dick. And maybe if we get him drunk he&#39;ll tell us where his power comes from!&quot;<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
Vinnie couldn&#39;t take his heart being crushed anymore. He pushed the memory away, returning to the present. He walked towards the coach&#39;s office and saw him drawing complicated markings on the ground, &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The world is mainly made up of two types of people.&quot; Rafe explained, not pausing with his with the designs on the floor &quot;Those who would fear our power and those who covet it. Horst and Carter don&#39;t seem smart enough to fear anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even so, can&#39;t we just erase their memories or something?&quot; Vinnie asked. &quot;Why turn them into socks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can with those who fear you. They desperately want to forget so their memories are easy to modify. Those who covet it unfortunately cling onto their desire for power and must be silenced in other ways.&quot; Rafe explained, gesturing towards Horst and Carter on Vinnie&#39;s feet, &quot;Sometimes they only need to be silenced temporarily before they learn fear, then they can be saved, but other times if they are too stubborn or it takes them too long the memories become too strong to erase. I&#39;m hoping becoming a pair of socks will knock some sense into those two, and I wont need a more permanent solution like the lockers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But even then why turn the lost causes into lockers?&quot; Vinnie asked. &quot;Why leave them out to be kicked and abused?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are two sources of magical energy. The first is from casters, and that&#39;s what happens when you say your commands or I snap my fingers.&quot; Rafe explained, he stood up, dusting the chalk from his hands &quot;The second is from the clash of suffering and pleasure, such as the suffering Ryan feels from being your jockstrap and the pleasure you feel from masturbating into him, or the pleasure from a locker&#39;s penis handle being edged and suffering from not being able to cum. Unless you&#39;re willing to sustain a spell yourself forever you need to ensure that the subjects are experiencing the two forces in sufficient amounts, or else everything reverts to normal. When modifying memories you have to replace it with a memory that is both painful and pleasurable to ensure it sticks. Even the immunity spell I&#39;m preparing now won&#39;t stick unless I empower it every day, which means for as long as I have you as my apprentice I&#39;m weaker for all the energy I&#39;m using on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie nodded thinking over everything. It was a lot to take in. He was jolted out of his deep thought as a plastic cup came flying at him. With the reactions of three football players floating in the back of his mind he snatched it out of the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enough with the lessons for now. You&#39;ll have to cum in that before I teach you anything else&quot; Rafe ordered. &quot;When you release your load be sure to think &#39;This tribute shall provide protection from my magic in exchange for knowledge and power&#39;. If it makes it easier, say it out loud repeatedly as you&#39;re about to blow. If you don&#39;t do it right you&#39;re going to have to jack off again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie nodded, and began pulling on his cock. Since had already blown four loads today he didn&#39;t like the idea of having to push out a sixth and wanted to get this right the first time. It didn&#39;t take long for him to get close to cumming when he saw his big hairy coach start stripping down completely uninhibited. His hairy cock flopped down as he stood there waiting for Vinnie to finish. Soon he was spilling forth with semen once again as he recited the mantra aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;This tribute shall provide protection from my magic in exchange for power and knowledge-uuuugh&quot; Vinnie moaned as he milked out a few drops of cum (his balls were practically empty at this point). He could feel Ryan&#39;s relief at not being cummed in.<br />
<br />
Coach took the cup from him without a word, and began smearing it around the circle. Suddenly the markings flared with light. The light rushed towards Rafe running along the lines and he absorbed it into his veins which glowed beneath his skin all over his body. Slowly the glowing began to subside and the coach stepped out of the circle and pulled his shorts back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now that that&#39;s done,&quot; Coach looked at Vinnie, &quot;Time for your first official lesson...&quot;</p>
