<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Owen didn&#39;t want to admit it, but since he&#39;d become a guy, his life was a lot better. Waking up earlier, he was careful not to wake Aimee as he slid out bed, shucked off his pyjamas, and went through his usual exercise routine. Finishing, he headed for the bathroom, where he ran the shower. Standing under the water, thinking of what seemed more a dream than reality, he wondered how best to approach Aimee on the idea he&#39;d been toying with for some time of staying as Owen instead of going back to being Felicity.<br />
<br />
&quot;If there is any merit to those dreams,&quot; he mused as reached for the shampoo and measured out some to run through his hair.<br />
<br />
Shower complete, he headed back into the shared bedroom. There, he dressed for the day and looking at Aimee, he was tempted to wake her with a kiss. But getting a better idea, he thought it would mean more to wake her with breakfast. Knowing what she&#39;d want, he smiled and headed out. Not seeing any reason to lock the door, as the dorm they&#39;d selected to live didn&#39;t have the problems some of the others had, Owen headed downstairs. Thinking the first place he&#39;d go was to get one of the croissants Aimee loved, then her favourite coffee place for a small, mocha-shot infused coffee with a hint of creamer, he crossed the quad, thoughts also on the few take-home assignments he also had to complete before his next class in a few days.<br />
<br />
When he returned half an hour later, the last thing Owen expected was to hear Aimee crying. Setting the breakfast he&#39;d gotten down on the table in the combination kitchen living room, he went to her. Drawing her into a hug, breathing deep her scent, he said, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of all the things he expected to hear, the one thing he never even considered was when she told him, &quot;I was woken by the sound of someone moving about. At first, I thought it was you, come back for something. But, the more I listened, the more this didn&#39;t feel right. Waiting to see what they&#39;d do, wanting to confront them, I waited until the left before getting up. Leaving the bedroom, I looked about, but not seeing anything out of place, I almost went back to bed. But, at the last minute, checked the room we&#39;d set up as an office. There, I noted subtle details of someone having recently gone through everything. And then it hit me. As I discovered the disk was gone, I also saw someone had stolen our laptop.&quot;<br />
<br />
At first, none of what she was telling him sunk him. In shock someone had actually entered their dorm whilst Aimee was sleeping, it was as from far off he heard the girl telling him, &quot;Don&#39;t you understand. They took the laptop and the disk. The disk. The one with the Chronivac programme on it. The one which made us who we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shocked by this, Owen numbly nodded. His plans of a surprise breakfast, of breaking it to Aimee he didn&#39;t want to go back to being Felicity leaving him, he muttered, &quot;You, me, we...&quot; but was unable to finish whatever he was trying to say.<br />
<br />
Aimee, still shook up by the way someone had entered the shared apartment, stolen from them, had made off with the one thing which would allow her to become Paul again, something she wasn&#39;t too sure of, as she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d ever been a dude, or if it was some crazy dream she&#39;d had. Discovering a part of her wanted to be this Paul person, if it was accurate she was, she leaned against Owen and breathed deep his familiar scent. Feeling muddled, as if she&#39;d start crying again, liking how comforting it was to be held by the man, she had a brief flash of wondering, &quot;Is this how Felicity felt when I held her,&quot; before she asked herself, &quot;Who&#39;s Felicity. I&#39;ve never known anyone by that name, even among all the girls I&#39;ve dated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Content to stand there, holding his girlfriend, Owen was unsure what to do. A part of him wanted to tear out of the small apartment, find the person, and force them to give back what they&#39;d stolen. Yet, at the same time, another part of him thought the best course of action was to notify the campus police. Torn, wanting also to do nothing but stand where he was and continue to comfort Aimee, he hugged her closer when she rubbed her face against his shirt, looked up at him, and taking the cue she was giving him, they kissed. Listening as she whispered, &quot;How could anything like this happen,&quot; he wasn&#39;t sure how to respond, and shifting his weight, he picked her up, thought up carrying her to the couch, and instead carried her into their bedroom. Setting her down gently on the bed, he climbed in next to her, and the two lying there, Owen listened as the girl murmured, &quot;I feel so conflicted about what happened. About what it all means. Is this to be my life? Will I never be Paul again, if it&#39;s true I was such a person? Will you never be Felicity, if, again, it&#39;s true this was who you were?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure it&#39;ll work out,&quot; Owen replied, figuring this was the best answer.<br />
<br />
With a nod, Aimee snugged closer. Wanting to tell Owen so much, but not sure where to start, she remained where she was a bit longer before wiggling about to first give him a kiss, then move so she ended up on top of him. Following her cues, Owen returned the sign of affection as she shifted in place to better allow Aimee to straddle him. Starting to get hard, it was with a start when both realised in the time they&#39;d spent as Aimee and Owen, they&#39;d never gone so far as to have sex. Reaching up to cup one of Aimee&#39;s breasts with one hand, Owen used his other to run it through her soft, full hair. Feeling through the fabric of her t-shirt her erect nipple, he wanted to reach up under the garment to touch her full breast. Rolling over instead so he was almost lying atop his girlfriend, he worked with his pants until Aimee gently pushed him away.<br />
<br />
Not offended by this, he took the opportunity to kick off his shoes and remove his shirt and pants. As he did this, Aimee slipped out of the sleeper shorts she had on and, after a moment&#39;s thought, shucked off her shirt. Both now naked, Owen edged closer to kiss her as he rubbed his now fully erect member against her groin. For a split second, each hesitated, wondering if this was okay. But then biology won out as Aimee against straddled Owen. And as he cupped her breasts, teased her nipples, kissed parts of her body, he lay her down. Using his erect shaft to make her moist, stimulate her clit, he waited until he was almost ready to pop before, fumbling about, he took from out of the nearby nightstand a condom. Protecting himself, Aimee&#39;s kisses getting more and more needful, he waited a bit longer before he plunged his way into her secret folds. Grasping at his back, matching his movements, the girl gasped. And as she was brought to climax, and Owen felt his body release its load, each moan and gasped until, with a content sigh, they separated. Spooning afterward, neither said anything, and after sometime, Aimee stood and headed for the bathroom, where she began to run the shower.<br />
<br />
On the bed, Owen removed the condom he had on, tied it shut and chucked it in the basket next to Aimee&#39;s vanity. Heading for the bathroom, he stepped into the shower behind his girlfriend, who wasn&#39;t washing herself, but letting the water run over her naked body. Slipping his arms under hers, he hugged her closer. As he did this, Aimee let out a slight moan and reclining her head back to rest on him, she whispered, &quot;So what now? Is this to be out life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it so bad?&quot; Owen asked before saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know about you, and I was going to wait for a better time to say this, but I was thinking of staying as Owen, if in fact I was this Felicity at one time.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was not what she expected to hear. Asking herself if it would be so bad to give up being Paul, to accept it wasn&#39;t anything more than a weird dream, Aimee let her mind wander as she blissfully stood under the stream of warm water, comforted by the closeness of her boyfriend. Knowing the one thing they ought to do, she voiced the opinion, &quot;I think something we ought to do right away is contact campus security,&quot; and Owen agreeing, neither made a move to leave the shower, content for the moment with each other&#39;s company, lost in their own private thoughts as each deliberated over the theft and what it might mean about them ever being who they used to be.</p>
