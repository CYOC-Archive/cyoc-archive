<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>They opened their eyes and looked at each others' unchanged bodies.
<P>"Was it good for you?" Dan asked.
<P>Sally tried to shake off her disappointment and go with Dan's remark. She summoned up an over-the-top slutty voice. "Oh YES. It WAS, Dan."
<P>"You make a lovely twin sister," Dan continued.
<P>"Okay, stop," Sally said. "I can't go along with it now." She felt foolish for holding out hope that the rings were really magical.
<P>"Sorry, Sal," Dan said. "I didn't want to ruin the fun..."
<P>"Yeah, I... I know... Dan!" Sally's eyes widened.
<P>Dan was already adopting a similar expression. "I'm changing, yeah. Yeah! You're changing too!" With the word "too," Dan's voice arced sharply in pitch.
<P>Both of them stared in awe at the changes happening to the other. Sally watched Dan's hair rapidly spill from his head, the feminine locks draping over his diminishing body. Dan anxiously swatted his growing hair away from his face to watch Sally's changes, which were more subtle than his, but still significant. Her face changed shape somewhat, getting a little thinner. Her nose a touch rounder. Her hair was altering a little as well. It was getting a little longer, and less curly. Her bushy hair straightened into a moderate wave.
<P>"It feels so weird," Sally said. "It's like a tingling."
<P>"Like you're covered in seltzer water," Dan commented. "Wow, that's my girl voice? It's a little squeaky."
<P>"OUR voice, now," Sally corrected using the exact same pitch, which was a tad higher than her own.
<P>Dan's clothes began to crumple as his body finished shrinking. He was thinner, shorter, but despite this his tee-shirt bulged in one particular area. He knew by the presence of tugging weights on his chest that he now sported two ample breasts.
<P>"I've got boobs," he said bluntly. Sally giggled. There was a tingling in her bra, followed by a tightening sensation. She was somewhat taken aback. She didn't expect her own breasts to gain half a cup size. Then she felt a small tingle inside her vagina.
<P>Dan jolted a few inches into the air before his butt landed back on the floor. "I think...eh...I think I just became all woman."
<P>Sally laughed. "Welcome to the club, sister!" She came out of her paralyzed trance to pounce on Dan, knocking him back onto the soft rug. Their soft brown hair fell about them like a blanket.
<P>"Heh heh, thanks...sister," Dan smiled. Their button noses touched and their sky blue eyes locked on each other.
<P>"I'd say we should check ourselves out in the mirror, but what'd be the point?" Sally said, climbing off Dan and sitting cross-legged. She began to unbutton her blouse.
<P>"What are you doing?" Dan asked, sitting up.
<P>"My bra's too tight. You imagined a bimbo."
<P>"I imagined the body we decided on," Dan protested.
<P>"Well apparently, your libido had other plans. C cups? And I thought we agreed on waist-length hair?" Sally grabbed a handful of the sandy brown silk that now fell from her head and gathered on the carpet around her butt.
<P>"I forgot you nixed the floor-length hair," Dan admitted.
<P>"You'll understand why once you see how annoying it is to have hair this long. You and your hair fetish." Sally was merely teasing. She knew it was only temporary, and that she could even chop hers off if she wanted. She removed her shirt and bra and stood up. Dan watched in aroused awe as her wavy hair fluttered about her flawless chest, past her waist and came to a stop at her knees with a bit of a curl.
<P>"The rings must have averaged our thoughts," Dan guessed, noting the length compared to the lengths he and Sally envisioned. "At least we got the important stuff right."
<P>"I guess you must not count 'height' as important. I wanted to stay the same way I was."
<P>"Sorry," Dan apologized. "I didn't realize exactly how tall you were." He stood up to join her, not surprised to be at perfect eye level with his girlfriend-turned-twin "stranger". Her cute face was complimented by her lovely hair and blue eyes. She was about an inch shorter than she had been, meaning Dan was much shorter than he started out. Her thin frame had a bit of healthy muscle and a gorgeous hourglass figure. "We look awesome," he said.
<P>Then Dan's pants and boxers dropped to the floor. If not for the shirt that was now two sizes too large for him, they would have seen "her" new reproductive organs.
<P>Sally looked down at Dan's smooth legs leading up to the bottom of Dan's baggy shirt, then looked into his eyes and gave an encouraging smile.
<P>Dan suddenly felt sheepish about seeing himself, but knew that fair was fair, and they'd probably both be completely naked soon enough. He slowly lifted his shirt like it was a funeral shroud.
<P>At first he saw nothing at all between his legs, just the obvious absence of his male genitals. But he looked closer and saw the start of his female slit. Peering over further, he beheld his new pussy.
<P>"Miss the old boys yet?" Sally teased.
<P>"Of course, but this should be...a fun thing to try. For this little while." Dan wasn't sure how he felt about losing his penis. It was like a part that defined him was now gone, but he felt that shouldn't be more important than all the other parts of him that were altered as well. Plus, he was aware of a small amount of eagerness to feel new sensations only a woman could feel.
<P>"Okay, let's actually check out a mirror," Sally said. She lead Dan out of his pool of shed clothing and into the bathroom, where they both saw their complete new selves for the first time.
<P>It was one thing seeing Dan becoming a woman, but it was another for Sally to see herself as the exact same woman. The full extent of her changes was revealed. She looked for something familiar, a curve or a body mark that she shared with her original self, but every bit of her looked foreign. Her breasts were a bit bigger and firmer, her waist was more trim, and her face was completely different. Her pants didn't fit right anymore, though they weren't in danger of coming off like Dan's did. The body she saw in the mirror, and the knowledge that she shared every last detail of it with her boyfriend's, stirred up mixed feelings of unease and excitement.
<P>When the couple was done checking themselves over and sorting their thoughts about themselves, they looked back at each other.
<P>"So," they said with perfectly pitched voices sounding in unison. "What now?"</p>
