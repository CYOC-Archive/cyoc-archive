<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your soul had entered your egg as you were being lain. Your parents were butterfly people, a sort of beastmen known for their slightly higher than normal intelligence and beauty once matured. Like most beastpeople they still don&#39;t have many rights, although your parents were lucky enough to be owned by fashion designers. They were treated well and kept happy and even given an education, especially as their children looked similar to humans although plump. A few months later you came out of your egg, and as your masters had described was one of the fattest babies they had ever seen. Your parents had named you Papo. What were the odds, but the masters had recently had their own child as well. A little boy they called Richard. Being born so close to each other your masters allowed you to learn with Richard during his home schooling, and even let you play with him. It was a good time, although your body was slow and fat Richard still had a good time playing with you. Although once he started going out more and more he seemed to be growing a bit more distant  especially when he turned 11 and started noticing other girls. <br />
<br />
Around that time your mother started giggling a little bit. You had asked her what was funny and she responded &quot;I see what&#39;s happening, and don&#39;t worry. Soon you&#39;ll become nice and beautiful. you&#39;re body will make itself a cocoon  and then dissolve and remake itself beautiful!&quot; <br />
<br />
You asked &quot;Dissolve?&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed and said &quot;yep into a goo, but don&#39;t worry just the most important parts of you will remain.&quot; and she giggled a bit more having been told be her mother she went through a similar scared phase, but  completely forgot once she metamorphisized. Feeling a bit scared about what your body may soon do to itself you decided to shake off that fear. It was Richard&#39;s 12th birthday soon and you may begin to start to meet some of the kids he went out to meet every now and then. <br />
<br />
A day later you were in a dress that supposedly would make you seem thinner, and you sat in a chair near the large table. Some guests came in, and Richard came to you with a girl with long straight black hair, and pretty sapphire like eyes. Richard said &quot;Papo i&#39;d like to introduce you to my friend Cathrine. Cathrine this is my childhood buddy Papo.&quot; You felt a little bit of jealousy over the girl&#39;s beauty.<br />
<br />
That said you put on a smile and said &quot;Hello Cathrine.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cathrine put her hand out and said &quot;I was hoping to see you. You were one of those butterfly beastmen right? I can&#39;t wait to see you once you&#39;ve changed.&quot; <br />
<br />
You shook her hand and said &quot;I just wish I could be as pretty as you without going into a cocoon... I&#39;m not even sure how i&#39;d make one.&quot; <br />
<br />
Catherine getting a little closer to Richard said &quot;I&#39;ve heard you&#39;ll know what to do when the time comes. Although how long would it take for you to change once in the cocoon?&quot; <br />
<br />
Richard said &quot;I&#39;ve heard it takes years. I think i&#39;ll feel rather lonely once you start to change Papo. We&#39;ve known and had fun with each other for so long.&quot; <br />
<br />
Catherine getting a little more clingy said &quot;Oh Richie, I can always come over when your lonely.&quot; Your heart started to throb a bit. You were never that close to Richard, but Catherine had in such a shorter amount of time. You started to scratch the back of your head, and Catherine asked &quot;Papo, do you have bad dandruff?&quot; All you could mutter was a huh before Catherine took your hand and said &quot;I&#39;ve had bad dandruff in the past, let me show you how I deal with it.&quot; then as she pulled her hand came off and she felt something odd and said &quot;What is... huh?&quot; She looked in her hand and saw some odd webbing. <br />
<br />
Richard said &quot;Papo your skin... it&#39;s ... I think your making your cocoon.&quot; Alarmed you looked at your arms which were starting to get covered in the string and getting thicker. Scared you started to try to rip off the webbing but it just kept coming. Richard asked &quot;Papo isn&#39;t this normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was covering your face and you ripping it off started curling up in terror and muttered &quot;I don&#39;t want to die...&quot; as you continued to try to deny your body doing it&#39;s thing. having curled up it felt oddly comforting, and after a minute of panicking your body calmed itself down as the webbing enveloped you. Everyone was watching as a girl had just turned herself into a cocoon. <br />
<br />
Richard asked &quot;Are you alright in there?!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Barely hearing him you muttered &quot;Please don&#39;t leave me...&quot; <br />
<br />
Richard said &quot;I&#39;m here Papo!&quot; hearing the commotion your mother and Richard&#39;s parents came into the room to find everyone staring at a silk encasing. Your mother flew over in glee. The air in your cocoon was getting hot and more filled with carbon dioxide. Then something felt more odd as it felt like your stomach flipped inside out and your body started to feel like it was eating itself. You groaned in agony and Richard asked &quot;Papo are you ok?!? Is this that dying thing?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
your mother overhead said &quot;I can see why you may think that, but it&#39;s just nature doing it&#39;s course. Her body is dissolving itself into a soup to where some of the most important parts are kept and the rest will turn itself into a majestic form.&quot; Richard didn&#39;t know this but felt scared for his old friend and he grabbed a knife to which his mother said &quot;You open that cocoon now and she&#39;s dead. Considering she&#39;s screaming her body is halfway dissolved, opening the cocoon will let in all sorts of bacteria and will let her body leak out and she&#39;ll never be whole again.&quot; Richard put the knife back and your mother said &quot;I&#39;ll take care of my daughter. Please enjoy your little party little master.&quot; your mother lifted your moaning cocoon which after a few minutes stopped moaning. You consciousness went dark, a long time had passed and in your heart the most important things you clutched was your love of your family, but especially Richard. And your Jealousy of Catherine.</p>
