<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I am basing this off of the assumption that Marcella was booked and taken to jail for her actions as Chrissy the victim was allowed to go home (as depicted in prior chapters).</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcella Walker was sitting in a large cell in the Lyre police station. It was one of a few places that could lock up an Animalian of her size as she sits for arraignment. She sighed as the monitor in front of her had the logo of the Clark County courthouse prominently displayed as she waited for the judge to set whatever bail conditions she had to abide by. The nature of her acts, made having the trial in a small town difficult; so it was decided without her input to have the proceedings take place in Las Vegas. Thinking back on the day of the prom, Marcella was acting on jealousy and wanted revenge for being snubbed by her once best friend. Getting into a fight and becoming an elephant Animalian like Chrissy was not part of the plan. Marcella just wanted Chrissy to break down as she became an anthropomorphic animal freak and she could swoop in and console Steve, a boy Marcella also had eyes for. Instead it turned into a knock down fight that destroyed the prom and caused damage to the venue while also making her become an Animalian as she fought to defend herself.<br />
<br />
While Chrissy got to go home, Marcella was arrested and taken to the local police station after it was determined she orchestrated stealing a sample of the animalian virus and used it to cause what could have been a second outbreak. Marcella let out a snort of frustration; her nose now a grey skinned appendage that she could manipulate, acting as a third hand, rose up as she bellowed her discomfort. A member of the rhino guard who was standing outside her cell, turned to look to see if the inmate was causing a disturbance. Seeing she was still waiting for her turn with the judge he went back to ignoring her; confident that she couldn’t cause any more damage for the moment.<br />
<br />
*************<br />
<br />
It was an hour later when guards came in to remove the monitor that was brought to her cell. They noted how defeated she looked as they overheard her shouts to the judge and her attorney as the prosecutor put forth a motion to transfer her trial from juvenile court to adult court. This meant serious time and no sealed record once she became twenty one. Her charges ranged from vandalism, assault, theft of property over a thousand dollars; the Animalian virus sample she took wasn’t exactly the price of a candy bar. She was looking at a possible felony charge. But what really floored her was the added charge of domestic terrorism as a result of her actions; this caused her to blow up and she was swearing up a storm at everyone observing the proceedings over the zoom connection. Her attitude was so appalling that the judge was forced to not only mute her but at one point, transfer her to a private conference channel so her court appointed attorney could calm her down. The attempt to get her to maintain composure and respect the rules of the court room fell on deaf ears as she continued to voice her displeasure at what she considered a simple fight between teenage girls. The judge, a no nonsense man of the law who was once an attorney working for legal aid just shook his head and denied her bail. Despite this being her first offence, the multitude of charge laid before her and Marcella’s attitude made clear that she was a danger to society and needed to remain behind bars until the conclusion of her trial. The judge also ordered a competency hearing to determine if she was mentally competent to stand trial.<br />
<br />
Now she sat alone in her cell, the large orange jumpsuit she had to wear offering no comfort to the dread chill she was feeling. It was just dawning on Marcella that she royally fucked herself and that she was possibly looking at a stint behind bars.<br />
“They can’t possibly think I am a terrorist,” Marcella spoke. Her words hanging in the air as she was alone in her cell. Sitting on the thin mattress that covered the concrete slab that was her bed. It was placed next to a stainless steel toilet lacking a seat, complete with a sink on top. On the other side of her cell was a metal table with a round circular object made of concrete like the rest of her cell. This was the chair for the metal desk affixed to the wall. While her cell was large, it was in no way any different than the standard format for all jail/prison cells that was being used.<br />
<br />
The sound of her cell door opening made her look up to see a white rhino animalian motioning her to step forward. The member of the rhino guard quickly had her handcuffed as she was escorted down n hall of empty cells and she was lead to a room with a table. She was made to sit at one end and was handcuffed to the table. At the other end was her parents. The sat looking like they aged twenty years in the span of a few days since the prom incident. While Marcella’s mother was inconsolable, her father looked stoned faced. He was the first to speak.<br />
<br />
“We are disappointed with you,” Marcella’s father glaring; his eyes furrowing at the double dosed elephant animalian that was his daughter.<br />
“I thought we raised you better,” he continued; making it clear she was not to talk but only listen. “Because of you, your mother and I have not had a moment’s peace. Our phones have not stopped ringing; constant text messages, emails and protesters camping out on the street ready to harass us the second we show our faces in public. We had to shut everything down as we work to secure new numbers. Even your aunt,” Marcella’s father shouting; “my sister, a religious kook to begin with has been using this incident to further her right wing nonsense. You made us pariahs and a laughing stock in the community. Your mother lost her job because of you,” her father glaring; “I’ve been put on administrative leave from my employment. I may be forced to take a transfer to a different jurisdiction if I intend to remain employed with the department of corrections. Yes daughter,” Marcella’s father shouting; “that means I won’t be a corrections officer at whatever prison you might get sent to. I will not be there to look out for you.”<br />
<br />
“Dad,” Marcella looking up; tear running down her face. She wanted to speak further be he silenced any further attempt as he stood up.<br />
“You have been expelled from school,” He looks at her; “chances are you will be made to repeat the grade. And I hear Chrissy has made it clear that she will never forgive you, nor will she work any shift at the,” her father shuddering at the next part; “she will never work a shift with you at the Meat Market. Chrissy has made it clear that, that was hill she was willing to die on. Whoring your body out to help pay off the damages and whatever court costs and fines that may be incurred,&quot; Marcella&#39;s father blanching at the ideal that she was going to strip as a way to make restitution. “And assuming if Lyre’s WSA accepts your admission to enroll to finish high school, you will most likely be forced to attend via remote learning. Your mother and I will attend your trial as you are our daughter, but that is it.” The imposing man knocking on the door to signal he is done. “If I were you,” he turns around after Marcella’s mother walks out, her whimpering not abating as her husband rightfully unloaded on their daughter; “plead guilty to the charges. Spare your mother any more stress. As this is your first offense, you just might get off with a light sentence. But don’t expect us to help with the fines. That you are on your own.”<br />
<br />
Marcella watched as her father left the room leaving her broken and alone.</p>
