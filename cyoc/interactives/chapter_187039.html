<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>plenty of Ethan & Eric ideas left, so stay tuned</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Ethan was setting up the fun house with his friend, Eric wandered about the grounds and watched some of the other students and helpers setting up other attractions and getting things in place. He killed quite a bit of time just exploring and getting the layout of everything fixed in his head. During that, Eric couldn&#39;t help thinking about Lucas. It wasn&#39;t just that he didn&#39;t act like a know-it-all asshole like most guys around that age, and that he actually spoke to Eric like he was a human being, but more how he and Ethan interacted.<br />
<br />
He knew Ethan&#39;s mannerisms well, and while his brother was popular, there weren&#39;t many people who were actually close to him. Lucas though? It seemed the new guy had managed to overtake almost everybody else with not much effort at all, but more than that, Ethan was actually giving him a LOT of attention in return. Eric wasn&#39;t sure what exactly Lucas had done to manage this, but he liked that his big brother was becoming good friends with somebody so cool.<br />
<br />
While he was exploring, Eric also started to think about the ring too. He hadn&#39;t been intending to do anything weird with it, but his creativity began to take flight based on his observations. By the time the fair was set to open, his boyish curiosity was plotting what combination of things it could fool around with, and he happily went back to check in with Ethan before he put any plans into action. His brother asked why he seemed so chipper, but Eric just made excuses, took the proffered spending money, said hi to Lucas, and was off again.<br />
<br />
It was time to have a little fun!<br />
<br />
The first stop Eric made was to the lost and found closet. There was hardly anything there as it was still early on, but there were leftover items from the previous years in storage. While it was normally policed by an attendant, he waited until she was busy and distracted, and he slipped out with a beanie and a pair of glasses.<br />
<br />
The beanie was a little large for him, but not too big to wear, and the glasses were round, with thick prescription lenses that were very strong. Excited, he then made his way through the fair, looking for another opportunity, when he passed by the farmyard enclosures, and a really weird idea came to him. Stealthily, he made his way around to one of the animal pens away from the public, until he saw something that could work. Snatching the object he found a secluded spot where he could put his plan into action. His new acquisition was a bent metal half-circle meant for horse hooves but smaller -- a donkey-shoe! -- and with any luck it would provide some ... interesting results.<br />
<br />
With everything prepared, Eric donned the glasses and cap, placed the shoe under his foot, and focused.<br />
<br />
The first change was the ears. They morphed out into a longer thin shape, fur covering them, and Eric reached up to feel them. Donkey ears! Cool! They were fuzzy and twitched under his fingers, and he looked like he was from Pinocchio! The sound was weird, like two funnels attached to his head, and he flexed the ears briefly, before he pulled the beanie on his head and tucked them inconspicuously under it and behind.<br />
<br />
The second change was his teeth. With a rush of nervousness over something so different from previous swaps, Eric&#39;s upper jaw gave a little jolt, and then began to thrust out. In moments, his teeth had pushed down and forward, enlarging rapidly. Outgrowing his regular human lower jaw, his new buck donkey teeth had a distinct overbite, and running his tongue over them, they felt enormous -- uneven, thick, square, blocky, and horribly unseemly.<br />
<br />
If only his dentist could see his &#39;beautiful smile&#39; now.<br />
<br />
The third and last change was his eyes. One second, the glasses were so strong he could barely stand to be wearing them, the next he felt his nerves spasm and his retinas weaken significantly. Suddenly, the world came into focus through the lenses, the glasses becoming a perfect match. Curious, Eric took them off, and everything around him turned super blurry -- he could barely see more than a couple of feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; he thought, &quot;my vision sucks! But ... I wonder if I look anything like what I imagined?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling out his phone, he activated the camera, and reversed it so he could get a look at himself.<br />
<br />
Instead of the cute boy he knew he was -- a much younger doppelganger of his good-looking older brother, with clear eyes and a bright smile -- there was a truly weird-looking kid. Thick glasses, very weak eyes, a protruding upper jaw that barely hid the horror of his teeth. When he grinned it was truly unflattering and almost disgusting, with the grotesquely large buck teeth appearing borderline inhuman. He tried to speak, and he could still produce words, but his voice came out in a simpering lisp that seemed to match his new appearance. Eric flushed red in embarrassment at how successful his transformation was, beyond even what he&#39;d thought, and before he could control himself, he let out a soft bray; a sighing &#39;haaawh&#39; of excitement.<br />
<br />
It was quickly turning into a new strange fantasy, and with his accidental vocalisation through his animal body parts affecting his mind -- not unlike his doggy behaviour at Mr Reyes -- he started to play along with it a bit, on purpose.<br />
<br />
He was an ugly nerd with a messed up face and a funny voice, and other kids definitely thought he was a weirdo. What they didn&#39;t know was his secret -- he was part donkey! He had to keep his ears hidden of course, but the most important thing by far was, obviously, his cock! He was hung like a donkey too, and as Eric wandered cautiously back out into the crowds, he decided to see what the world was like through his new persona.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for him to realise that he was almost unrecognisable. He passed by several people that he knew, and none of them noticed him, apart from a look of disdain or a scornful glance at his nerdy features. He got the same reactions from strangers though, as well as the same sweeping glances over his stuffed crotch, and all the casual notice definitely made Eric swell to half-hardness.<br />
<br />
He played a few games, and while he wasn&#39;t any good with the ring toss, nor the shooting games with darts and slingshots -- his weakened eyes made his distance coordination fairly bad even wearing the glasses -- he was enjoying himself. The strength tester too, he barely moved the puck halfway up the meter, earning him some snickers from observers that the nerd didn&#39;t have muscles worth a damn. He wasn&#39;t interested in the fortune teller, those things were stupid and mostly a scam, nor did he want to go near the fun house in case his brother or Lucas saw him.<br />
<br />
The next thing he tried was apple bobbing. The teen in charge immediately suggested he take off the beanie to avoid it getting wet, to which Eric respectfully declined -- there was NO way that was happening. The game itself turned out to be ridiculously easy. His enlarged teeth made gripping the apples child&#39;s play, and every time it took just a single bite and a couple of seconds, and he was a winner! Confused and surprised by the buck-toothed kid repeatedly winning, the teen suggested he give others a go after four consecutive successes, and Eric gracefully accepted. He shot a departing grin at the older boy, who recoiled in surprise and revulsion at the massive square teeth on display.<br />
<br />
Wandering back through the attractions, Eric&#39;s fun was interrupted when he was taking a shortcut between two prefab stalls, in a quiet spot shielded by stacked equipment. A hand grabbed him from behind, and then pushed him against the wall. It was an older boy, maybe thirteen or so, with the build of a young jock in the making -- taller, arrogant, and with a bored indifferent expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap! I thought there was NO WAY you could be that nerdy when I spotted you earlier ... but you totally are!&quot; The boy stared at Eric&#39;s face and started laughing. Glancing down at something near his foot, he snatched up the donkey-shoe that had fallen out of Eric&#39;s pocket. &quot;Aww, did you win this? Is it your lucky charm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, thstop! Thatsh mine! Haaaw!&quot; Eric lisped, but he was cut off by the bully snatching his glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Thatsh mine!&#39;&quot; The mocking imitation stung. &quot;What a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything had gone super blurry, and the boy stepped back, putting extra space between them. He was laughing as Eric groped at the air, trying fruitlessly to grab his glasses back, but all he could make out was a mess of indistinguishable shape and colour.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll just keep these, see how long you stumble around for.&quot; The bully&#39;s voice seemed to come out of the air, and Eric began to feel very very scared. <br />
<br />
If he DID take the shoe and the glasses ... Eric would be stuck that way!<br />
<br />
No more 20/20 vision, no more perfect teeth.<br />
<br />
Just terrible shortsightedness so bad he was almost blind, big blocky chompers that belonged on an animal, a simpering speech impediment, and ... donkey ears.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d be an actual freak!<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want that!<br />
<br />
His eyes watered, and he sniffled, giving a low &#39;haa-haaw&#39; of stressed-out anxiety, the fear so real.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, missing your mommy?&quot; The bully gloated. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll just smash these instead, and throw them away!&quot;<br />
<br />
No way!<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t let that happen!<br />
<br />
If there was one thing Eric hated, it was bullies. He was smarter than this one, and thinking quickly despite his overwhelming terror at being stuck, he came up with an idea! Lunging towards the source of the bully&#39;s voice, his hand landed on the hem of the boy&#39;s scarf. He yanked it as hard as he could, and he felt it come away. Without hesitating, Eric pulled it up, wrapping it around himself, and focused.<br />
<br />
The feeling of his upper body and arms swelling with the muscle of a young teenager was a rush, and his height must have increased along with his expanded bodily proportions. Eric grabbed the bully with his new increased reach, and turned to shove the surprised and shocked boy against the wall in his place with only one arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What did you do?&quot; The boy stammered, trying to struggle, but he now had Eric&#39;s slim pre-teen chest and shoulders. &quot;I- ... wha- ... I&#39;m-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glasshes.&quot; Eric said. &quot;Or you can shtay thish way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My muscles, w-what did you- ... how did-&quot; he babbled, but he was interrupted again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give my glasshes and the shoe,&quot; Eric demanded, &quot;or my magic shpell will be forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take them!&quot; The bully shoved the items into his spare hand, and Eric pulled the glasses on first, and then pocketed the shoe again.<br />
<br />
Getting a good look at the boy, who was wearing an expression more terrified than Eric felt just a few seconds earlier, he almost wanted to laugh at how silly the bully was now. His head seemed too large for his shoulders and upper body, and while Eric was totally okay with his regular slim frame, this wannabe jock looked goofy and weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shwear you won&#39;t pick on shomeone like me again,&quot; Eric told him, &quot;or thish cursh will come back and do shomething worsh to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise! I won&#39;t do anything like this ever again!&quot; He begged, not wanting to cross the wizard who had stolen his arms. &quot;Please just make me normal and let me go! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Letting go, Eric stood back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; He said. &quot;But I&#39;m keeping your shcarf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Focusing, Eric reversed the swap, and his upper body shrank back to what it was, with the other boy swelling back to his previous size. Patting himself down to make sure he was okay, he didn&#39;t even pause for a second, and took off without even looking back, gone in seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was close.&quot; Eric thought to himself, leaning against the wall as he calmed his nerves. &quot;Frightening, but at the same time ... exciting? I mean, I could have been stuck like this, with these huge ugly teeth, and crappy vision, and furry ears, and ... a massive donkey cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down, he noticed that his pants were tented out, something about the situation having excited him, and without thinking too much more, he unzipped and pulled it out. He was nearly fully hard, oozing precum, and he began to stroke eagerly, his mind on what might have been.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have to show Ethan!&quot; Eric&#39;s hand slid up and down his long thick shaft, and he gently squeezed his balls, feeling a gush of liquid out the tip. &quot;It would have been so shameful and weird! Me, as a nerd, but,&quot; he grunted, his jerking picking up speed, &quot;a HUNG nerd! A nerd with a donkey cock! I&#39;m always gonna have it, because it&#39;s mine, and-&quot; he gasped, forcing out the last words one by one as he neared breaking point. &quot;I. Love. My. Cock!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a final groan and a surprisingly real-sounding bray, Eric&#39;s teenage balls shot rope after rope of sticky white. Lengthy splatters of it coated the dirt for several feet, with the most distant jets splashing onto the opposing wall to drip down the wooden panels. Panting, he stared at the awesome mess he&#39;d created, filled with both embarrassment that he&#39;d done it, and pride that he could produce so much. Wiping his foreskin clean, he tucked his dick back into his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough messing around,&quot; Eric told himself, as he basked in the warm glow of a quick pressure-release. &quot;Better switch back to being regular big-cock me, then maybe explore some more before I go bug Ethan again!&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
During his explorations -- now transformed back to his &#39;normal&#39; self -- Eric ended up roaming &#39;backstage&#39; through the setup area, and he found himself wandering into the supply tent for one of the stalls, run by a family friend that he and Ethan both knew. To his surprise, there were two dogs tied up inside, behind some piled up equipment and boxes. Not allowed to be running free while their owner, Mr Thompson, was busy elsewhere, they were safely tucked away here instead. The larger dog, a Golden Retriever, was asleep, but the smaller, a Springer Spaniel, retreated to hide inside its carry-cage as soon as it saw him.<br />
<br />
Aww! Eric&#39;s heart softened -- he didn&#39;t mean any harm! Ever since his adventure at Mr Reyes&#39; three days earlier, he felt differently toward dogs. He already liked them, but now he felt as if he knew them on another level, like he was a kindred spirit. It was a different kind of affection, and he found himself wanting to bond with this one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid! I won&#39;t hurt you!&quot; He crouched near the cage, but the spaniel refused to budge from inside. He frowned, pensive, and looked around. &quot;Maybe you just need some encouragement.&quot;<br />
<br />
On top of one of the boxes, he saw a spare collar and pair of leads, and he got an idea.<br />
<br />
Surely, it wouldn&#39;t hurt? Just once more?<br />
<br />
Slipping the collar over his wrist so he was &#39;wearing&#39; it, Eric loosened his pants, and dropped them down to his thighs, leaning his upper body and arms on the piled boxes. The weird pushing sensation began from his tail bone, and the Golden Retriever tail floofed into being behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? I&#39;m just like you.&quot; He called to the carry-cage in a half whisper. &quot;Come say hello!&quot;<br />
<br />
The change was enough. Cautious, the spaniel emerged and then padded slowly over to him. Still uncertain, it sniffed his ankle and pants leg for a moment, before it became more confident. As Eric felt the nose push right up into that sensitive area between his cheeks in the standard greeting, he blushed pink, and let go a contented sigh. His dick was swelling, and he didn&#39;t even know WHY it was so exciting, just that something about it felt so right, so intimate and naughty, and-<br />
<br />
Exactly at that moment, the owner poked his head into the tent, to check on his pets.<br />
<br />
Eric froze, his heart just about leaping out of his chest in shock, but he quickly recovered.<br />
<br />
The man couldn&#39;t see his lower half from the entry, and that was the way it HAD to stay!<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, h-hi, Mr Thompson!&quot; Eric managed, struggling to concentrate on speaking with the spaniel&#39;s nose lodged very soundly against his butt. It stayed pressed where it was, softly snuffling, and he was surprised he was able to say anything at all. &quot;Um, I- ... I was j-just -- haah -- playing with your dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hi Eric! Didn&#39;t know you were back here!&quot; He smiled. &quot;I see you&#39;ve met Mitzy and Scout.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, they&#39;re awesome. I l-love dogs, so I&#39;m glad -- uhhhh,&quot; Eric disguised a moan mid-sentence, and his tail began to wag out of reflex, barely out of sight from the entrance, &quot;um, g-glad I found them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve got a visitor! Mitzy is very friendly when she&#39;s not spending all her time napping, but Scout, he&#39;s normally super shy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re getting to k-know each other.&quot; He felt the nose slide down a little, and then the tongue shot out. It lapped a half dozen times against the back of his sac, lightly brushing his fat heavy teenage balls with the smooth wet surface. Eric fought to keep a straight face from the secret pleasurable embarrassment, and then the tongue was switching to his inner thighs, and the spaniel began to happily explore that space, licking the skin repeatedly and insistently from left to right and back again. &quot;Think we&#39;re gonna be -- uhhh -- friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know. I&#39;ll leave you to your fun.&quot; He nodded, still clueless about what was happening right in front of him. &quot;Be out the front at my stall if you need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment he was gone, Eric couldn&#39;t keep quiet any longer. He started to moan out loud, and then after a few more seconds of Scout&#39;s adventuring tongue all over his underside, he pushed the dog away. Pulling his pants down, his penis harder and thicker than he ever remembered, he sank to the ground. His head went to his lap, and Eric&#39;s lips slid hungrily along his oversized dick. All he could think about was the snuffling nose, the licking tongue, the soft skin of his butt and thighs, his wagging tail, but most of all how horny it made him, how good his cock felt, and how damn big it was. It took him only two dozen seconds, his lips rising and falling along the slick iron-hard rod, before it was exploding in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Pulse after pulse, he swallowed it all, and finally, Eric withdrew his head and sat up, licking his lips and catching his breath. He felt so relaxed, the bursts of sexual energy dying down, and the spaniel nudged up next to him while he recovered, the ice now apparently very well broken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess we&#39;re definitely friends now,&quot; Eric giggled, and he scratched Scout behind the ear, before giving a thoughtful smile, followed by a sigh. &quot;Even though it was fun, next time -- yeah, there WILL be a next time! -- I should do this somewhere safer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Someplace where he could borrow the other bits he enjoyed again too, like the paws, and the tongue.<br />
<br />
Yeah, DEFINITELY the tongue.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, there would be a next time.</p>
