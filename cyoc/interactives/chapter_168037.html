<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the first of august, a day highly symbolic since it was the birthday of not only both Jenny and Jeff, but also Shannon.<br />
… At least since Jeff made it so with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Jeff, he was currently in a luxurious suit tailored specifically tailored for the elegant woman body he now had. He may currently be in ‘Jeff-mode’ as proved his blue eyes and the fact he currently had an Adam&#39;s apple, only people aware of his situation would see him as a man with his wide hips, well manicured nails, long red hairs (even if they currently tied in the more masculine hairdo possible given the circumstances) and DD-cup breasts. He absentmindedly wondered if Jenny&#39;s boobs would grow that big in the future.<br />
<br />
Being in barely speaking terms with his family, they were only invited as a courtesy. He was glad they choose not to attend.<br />
<br />
All the other guests had come, be it Jenny&#39;s family (which was also his, since he was Shannon too) and friend, or his own friends (which included both those he made as Jeff and the ones he inherited from Shannon).<br />
<br />
At his right was his best-woman. At first he had wanted to make his second best-friend, Bradley Barock, as his best-man, but the teen revealed himself too immature for the task. (Brad used to be Jeff best-friend, but he now have to contend with Shannon&#39;s friends.) So instead he choose Laura Castille, a brilliant lawyer who is also Shannon&#39;s best-friend since childhood.<br />
<br />
Laura hadn&#39;t seen her best-friend that happy since Jenny&#39;s father died. Once again, she surprised herself by thinking one more time that having her body and life handed over to Jeff was the best thing to ever happen to Shannon, something she kept thinking since the day it happened.<br />
<br />
Jeff was about to glance as his eldest daughter, the one born from Shannon&#39;s first wedding, a brilliant medicine student called Emilia McBack (after Shannon&#39;s maiden name), but the music started and his jaw fell on the floor at the vision of beauty that was Jenny in her wedding dress, the effect only amplified by how much happiness the teenage redhead radiated.<br />
<br />
Jenny was accompanied to the altar by her brother, who their mother claimed looked very much like a younger version of their late father.<br />
<br />
After the usual blabla common to almost all christian weddings and once they both said yes to each other, Jeff made sure their wedding kiss was far more passionate than needed. Once the kiss ended he whispered in Jenny&#39;s ear &quot;just a little glimpse at what await you tonight, my love&quot; before winking. The teenage bride couldn&#39;t wait.<br />
— – - – —<br />
The reception had ended and the two lovers were finally able to rejoin their now shared bedroom.<br />
<br />
If there was one thing Jeff didn&#39;t inherit from Shannon when he took over her body and life, it was her sexuality. Shannon had been perfectly heterosexual, but Jeff was exclusively attracted to women even in ‘Shannon-mode’. Even then he was still Jeff at his core, after all. But what he did inherit was all her sexual experience, and used it to great effect in pleasing his wife.<br />
… Not that it was the first time they had sex since God united them. In fact, Jenny had maid tremendous progress, making her a far better lover than back during their first time, and even then he wouldn&#39;t have called her a bad one. (Just one that needed practice.)<br />
<br />
Just when his pennis was finally rock hard, which should have signaled the end of foreplay and the start of actual love-making, he retracted it into its pouch inside his vagina, which now felt like it was an ordinary one as a result. Having switched to ‘Shannon-mode’ she explained &quot;You may know intellectually that Jeff and me are now one and the same, your heart didn&#39;t accept it fully yet. You&#39;re still disassociating the two of us half the time, and neither you or I will be able to be sexually fulfilled until your heart acknowledge I&#39;m always Jeff at my core, even in Shannon-mode. You have good negotiation skills, so use your silver tongue to convince my wiener to go out to play. If you fail, I&#39;ll never go back into Jeff-mode.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, Jenny started to lip Shannon&#39;s vulva, an orifice that once dilated enough to let her pass through it, even if she had been far smaller back then. Since it didn&#39;t seem to be enough, she pushed her tongue, timidly exploring what goes beyond. As she gained more assurance in her exploration, she found herself reoriented so Shannon could reciprocate while massaging her buttocks. It made concentrating on the task at hand difficult, almost unable to continue. But she didn&#39;t stop and eventually, the head of Shannon&#39;s rod poked out of its hiding place. Hope renewed, Jenny worked harder at making that ‘stick of joy’ fully go out of her mother&#39;s vulva.<br />
<br />
Penis out again, Shannon switched back into Jeff-mode, and started to fuck his wife, taking care to stay gentle.<br />
<br />
What none realized was that Jeff&#39;s condom disappeared. Unknown to them, God had invited himself to their wedding, disguising himself as a human. Problem, he had made his disguise so perfect it could become drunk, and since said disguise had never consumed alcohol before since it didn&#39;t exist, it became intoxicated fast. And making a condom disappear was far from the worst thing the drunk divinity caused.</p>
