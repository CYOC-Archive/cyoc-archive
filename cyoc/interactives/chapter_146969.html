<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I am willing and able to go into extensive discussion about the topic, but I don&#39;t want to break the anti-fanfiction rule.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lions and tigers got quite a lot of attention among Animalians. The males were known to get very big and muscular. Heracles was bigger than any of them. As a liger, it took him longer to reach his full size and there was a lot of growing that went on before that. This meant that Heracles became a massive Animalian, standing 8&#39;7&quot; with muscles worthy of his namesake. What little flab he had from his leisurely zoo life he had been working off at the gym. And there were a lot of fangirls prowling around the gym while he was working out. It got rather irritating that these girls were only interested in Heracles&#39;s body and not about his personality. He was starting to think that all human women were like that when Madam Matryoshka called him to her office.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have perfect match for you, darling,&quot; said Matryhoshka, &quot;She is interested in being big, buff Animalian like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heracles gave a small snort and said, &quot;Sounds she&#39;d rather have my body than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but there&#39;s more,&quot; said Matryhoshka, &quot;She is bodybuilder in own right, vorks wery hard to keep in good condition. She also has big interest in Greek myths like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heracles lifted an eyebrow and asked, &quot;Like popular Greek myths or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Nyet</i>, she prefer original wersions,&quot; said Matryhoshka, &quot;You vill like her, I know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heracles sighed and said, &quot;Well, I can at least see her.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Heracles waited for his date with &#39;Mandy&#39; at his apartment. It was a rather spacious apartment, considering he was so big. His bedroom was mostly dominated by his very large bed. There was enough room for two of him on it, though Heracles had wondered for a while if he&#39;d ever have a mate. He also kept some dumbbells in his room for a little lifting. They were considerable bigger than the dumbbells that a normal man would keep in his house.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he heard a knock at the door. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get this over with,&quot; said Heracles before walking over. He wasn&#39;t sure what to expect with this date, but she blew whatever expectations he had away. Mandy was a pretty tall woman, being 6 feet even. She also had tanned, slightly-weathered skin. Since this was their first date, she had dressed more casually, wearing a halter top and yoga pants. This allowed Heracles to see the well-built and toned muscles of her arms and stomach. She also had a pleasing amount of curves that Heracles could see through her pants. Her chest was a little smaller than Heracles was expecting, but he was more interested in her face. It was a little lined, but it still had beauty. She had dark blue eyes that were almost indigo and she wore her long brown hair in a ponytail. Heracles felt such an immediate attraction to her that he swore he had been hit by Eros&#39;s arrow.<br />
<br />
Mandy apparently felt the same way, the way she was blushing and trying not to stare too openly. &quot;You&#39;re...even more impressive in person,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re impressive than any human woman I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; said Heracles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;You should have seen me before I got too ripped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too ripped?&quot; asked Heracles in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well...&quot; started Mandy before looking around to make sure no one else was listening, &quot;I used to work in...adult entertainment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That so?&quot; asked Heracles, not really fazed. He had heard that a lot before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I also worked on my bodybuilding career. But there&#39;s only so much you can bulk up without losing your curves,&quot; said Mandy, indicating her chest, &quot;Eventually, I was told I had to pick between keeping my girls or working my guns. I stuck to my guns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Animalians can have both,&quot; said Heracles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know that. It was very tempting to convert,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why didn&#39;t you?&quot; asked Heracles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it was pride,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;I wanted to prove I didn&#39;t need to change my species to still compete.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what changed your mind about that?&quot; asked Heracles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I missed having my big girls,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;Maybe I envy how Animalians are able to stay in shape with not so much work. Maybe I was waiting for the right guy to become available.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heracles cleared his throat and said, &quot;Well, we should get on with our date. There&#39;s still dinner and a movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could probably skip the movie,&quot; said Mandy, a little hint in her tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have to at least go to dinner,&quot; said Heracles, trying not to sound too eager.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The steakhouse wasn&#39;t strictly formal wear, so Mandy and Heracles got away with dressing more casually. They found they had a lot to talk about over dinner. Specifically of their appreciation of the original tales of Heracles and how Disney had basically gotten everything wrong with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I can understand why they made some changes,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;A lot of Greek myths weren&#39;t kid-friendly material.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean how Zeus was the ultimate womanizer, how Heracles was a product of divine rape, how his greatest foe was his stepmother, that the reason he had to do those twelve labors was because Hera drove him mad and made him kill his own family?&quot; asked Heracles, counting them off on his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, not really something the kids should watch,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;Though Hades wasn&#39;t a villain at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heracles scoffed and said, &quot;Name one form of pop culture that depicts Hades as anything but the villain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least Ares deserves some of his modern flak,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;Even the ancient Greeks didn&#39;t like him that much, except the Spartans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least the TV show gets closer to classic mythology,&quot; said Heracles, &quot;Not completely, but they did have inventive ways of portraying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
This conversation went on for quite a while. By the time the bill arrived, the two of them felt like they were meant to be. They would have gone straight back to Heracles&#39;s apartment and get on with the conversion. But there were still tickets to the movie and still had to go. They didn&#39;t pay a lot of attention to the movie. If they hadn&#39;t been waiting to go back to the apartment, they probably would have spent the whole movie making out. But they did a lot of time whispering pet names and sweet nothings to each other.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
By the time that Heracles and Mandy were back at his apartment, the two of them were feeling really needy for each other. Heracles had to excuse himself for a few minutes to get the counter-vaccine patch to make his virus viable again. Mandy took the time to get naked and wait for Heracles on his bed. When Heracles saw Mandy on his bed, he almost couldn&#39;t contain himself. &quot;You&#39;re more beautiful than I imagined,&quot; said Heracles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait until I&#39;m a ligress,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;Now kiss me.&quot; Mandy got up on her knees as Heracles leaned down to kiss her. It was a little awkward for him to shove his muzzle in her face and his tongue was a little too big for her mouth, but what was important was that their saliva was mixing.<br />
<br />
The changes quickly started. Tawny fur with black stripes was starting to appear over Mandy&#39;s body. Her body was also growing bigger, making it so that Heracles didn&#39;t have to stoop down as much to kiss her. The beginning of her tail was growing out of her back as her ears were moving up her head. Mandy could feel her body getting stronger, but she wasn&#39;t getting younger, yet. She pulled away from Heracles, her face already pushing out in a muzzle. &quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; she said in a purr.<br />
<br />
Heracles nodded before removing his boxers. His dick was already out of its sheath and ready to go. Like the rest of him, it was pretty massive, a complete 12 inches long. Though it was covered in soft nubs instead of sharp spikes, it would have hurt Mandy if he put it in her when she was fully human. But her pussy was already becoming more feline. Laying Mandy fully on the bed in the missionary position, her growing tail out of the way, Heracles posed his dick at Mandy&#39;s entrance. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve actually never been with another female before,&quot; said Heracles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky me,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;Just do what your instincts tell you.&quot; Heracles nodded before pushing the head in. Mandy gasped as he entered deeper. It was really tight, but as she was still growing, it became easier. Her body was shifting even faster as she got her second exposure. Her muscles, already well-defined, were growing even bigger. Her hands and feet were becoming paws as the fingernails and toenails became claws. While her hips had been pleasantly shaped before, they became rounded as her ass became more padded with curvy muscle. But the biggest change was to her chest. Having to sacrifice her fat for her bodybuilding goal, Mandy&#39;s chest had been left rather flat. But now it was filling up new fat reserves and mammary tissue. Mandy groaned louder as her face finished pushing out into a big cat&#39;s muzzle with sharp teeth. Heracles was grunting louder before he let out a mighty roar as his dick fired deep into Mandy. It took much more energy than Heracles was expecting and he felt himself feeling sleepy...<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Heracles awoke some time later to the sound of metal. Looking around, he soon found the source. Mandy was lifting his dumbbells rather easily. He took the time to admire her new body. She was truly an amazonian bodybuilder now, with heavy muscles and bountiful curves. Her formerly small chest was now very voluptuous and supported by strong pectorals. Heracles also admired her ligress body with its tawny fur and black stripes, a perfect mixture of lioness and tigress. The long brown hair perfectly suited her as well. Mandy heard him stir and smiled at him. &quot;Hey, lover,&quot; she said, &quot;Just wanted to see how strong I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to doze off like that,&quot; said Heracles, a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was your first time, I can excuse that,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;Besides, I wanted to take a look at my new body.&quot; She stood up and stretched, easily standing 8 feet tall now. &quot;It&#39;s everything I&#39;ve ever dreamed of,&quot; she said with a purr.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you think you&#39;re a demigoddess now, Mandy?&quot; asked Heracles teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;But I have been thinking of changing my name. How does Megara sound to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you being serious?&quot; asked Heracles, raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Heracles&#39;s wife in classic mythology,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;But I mostly want to go by &#39;Mega Megara&#39; in bodybuilding competitions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I think Megara suits you,&quot; said Heracles.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, is little Heracles ready for another round?&quot; asked Megara.<br />
<br />
Heracles glanced down to see his dick was coming out of its sheath again. &quot;Looks I&#39;m ready,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because I want to see how much this body can take,&quot; said Megara as she crawled onto the bed next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meg, before we get started, you should know that the Animalian virus has made me fertile. I can get you pregnant,&quot; said Heracles.<br />
<br />
Megara nuzzled his face and said, &quot;Good, I want to have your cubs. But after the IAC, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can live with that,&quot; said Heracles before he started kissing his new mate.</p>
