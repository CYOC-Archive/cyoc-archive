<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Semyaza just stared into the eyes of god as he cleared his throat; this is not the first time he has appeared before the council. Always choosing his words, couching his response; Semyaza was always confident that he could talk his way out of anything. This was his moment to strike.<br />
“As you can see my lord,” Semyaza stating as he watched Jehovah read his document; “that Kusheil has been on a tailspin as of late.”<br />
“Rumor is you helped him along,” Jehovah eyeing the angel with suspicion; “the iron knights ring a bell?”<br />
“Like all orders Kusheil made,” Semyaza looking meek; “I assumed that they had your support. Your backing,” Semyaza responds; “who would dare to question your wisdom.”<br />
<br />
Jehovah eyed the angel questioningly before looking back at the documents; they were very detailed. Including dossiers on the iron knights that infiltrated hell. The same iron knights that escaped the heaven and hell assault after Reverend Josh Church Sr slapped Penmue; Jehovah’s daughter.<br />
“And where are these iron knights,” Jehovah looking at Semyaza; “where did Kusheil place them?”<br />
“He ordered me to send the four down to earth,” Semyaza lying; “to rebuild the iron knight order. But only three reported for said duty.” Semyaza paused before explaining in detail which each iron knight is.<br />
<br />
Reverend Church is a hawk-headed angel with four red-feathered wings and an orange halo going by the name of Baziel. Rev. Mather became an angel with a pair of wings made from blue fire and veins of gold running all over his lily-white body; he is now named Esh. Dr. Bashir became an angel with four wings of white light and the head and tail of a lion. He was renamed to Ariel. Reverend Cromwell was last. He transformed into a  blue-winged angel whose eyes appeared to be a pair of glowing sapphires; now going by the name of Polytimos.<br />
<br />
Jehovah knew of the last one; smiling inward as he had a chat with Polytimos yesterday and heard his prayer of forgivness. As far as we was concerned; Cromwell is free from Church’s influence.<br />
“So where on Earth are they,” Jehovah eyeing Samyaza; “I would very much like to talk to them.”<br />
<br />
Before Semyaza could answer the question, a large disturbance could be heard as the doors to the council burst open. In walks an alabaster-white skin angel with jet black hair and six pairs of black-feathered wings; he glares at the council before sparing a moment to see Semyaza present. Kusheil looks stunned as his fellow inquisitor is present in court.<br />
“I suppose you are going to explain to me why my files on Enoch Morningstar have been removed,” Kusheil staring at Jehovah; “where is the report I had on his travels on earth? Why is the report on Tarfeil missing!”<br />
“As you can see your highness,” Semyaza not missing a beat; “Lord Kusheil here has been acting irrational.”<br />
“What are you talking about,” Kusheil looked at Semyaza; “you told me earlier that our lord ordered you to remove inquisitorial files.”<br />
“I made no such orders,” Jehovah handing Semyaza’s report to Jesus; “But I would like you to explain to me why you thought you had the authority to attack Enoch Morningstar in Raphael’s temple last night.”<br />
“Because he is a demon,” Kusheil turning red with rage; “Demons don’t belong in heaven.”<br />
“Demons don’t have halos,” Semyaza answering; “I met Enoch Morningstar yesterday, I clearly saw his halo.”<br />
“One who was born into darkness,” Kusheil seething; “is destined to be darkness. Enoch need to be expelled from heaven,” Kusheil snarling.<br />
<br />
“Do you have evidence to Enoch’s supposed evil intent,” Jehovah getting tired of this; “any concrete evidence? Or do you intend to use the same excuse as before? The inquisition is above the rule of Jehovah when the security of heaven is concerned?&quot;<br />
Kusheil was silent; as much as he hates to admit; Jehovah is correct. There is no evidence to prove that Enoch in doing anything sinister. But he just could not accept the fact that the wolftaur was being allowed to wander about freely. He even can’t tolerate the fact that the Papilio estate has been restored and two demons are now occupying it. Demons that he spent several hours spying on as they fucked each other’s brains out. <br />
“If I was permitted to lock them up and interrogate them,” Kusheil speaking finally before being interrupted.<br />
“So you can torture a false confession out of them,” Jehovah staring at Kusheil; “are we referring to Cassandra Papilio and Iris? Do you realise that Semyaza here has been explaining for a better part of an hour all of your questionable decisions?”<br />
<br />
“Can you explain this object called the Gauntlet of Nightmares,” Jesus looking at the report and focusing on a transcript from a confession made by Tarfeil. A confession that Semyaza included into the report.<br />
‘I&#39;LL TALK!!! I was in Japan. I was looking for a bride, and I also decided to check up on Mt. Fuji on behalf of the Nature Stewardship Corps. While I was there, I met a man whose face I recognized as Prince Enoch Morningstar. There was no mistaking it. He has his Uncle Michael&#39;s nose... only redder. I assumed he was looking for a wife like me, but he approached me and said that he was investigating someone&#39;s plan to tamper with the anti-Chaos ward beneath the mountain. Naturally horrified, I offered to help him get to the bottom of it.’<br />
“Statement made after using the Gauntlet of Nighmares on suspect demon collaborator Tafeil of the Nature Stewardship Corps,” Jesus closing the file as he stares at Kusheil.<br />
<br />
“First chaos infests my daughter’s library,” Jehovah looking sad; “now it seems to have infected the Inquisition. Kusheil,” Jehovah getting up; “you were there when we fought Tiamat. Beat it back to the beyond and sealed it away. What happened to you since then?”<br />
“Perhaps we should have Kusheil relieved of his duties,” Sandalphon chiming in; “have someone outside of the inquisition perform an audit of the organization an offer up methods for reorganization.”<br />
“No,” Kusheil screaming; “the Inquisition is mine!”<br />
“And I have the final say if you are to be relived of your duties or not,” Jehovah getting up; “Semyaza, is there any evidence that has been gathered to continue the incarceration of Tarfeil and Azure Skywing?”<br />
“No,” Semyaza looking at Kusheil as he pauses; daring not to show emotion as he knows the next few moments will determine if Kusheil dooms himself or not. “What little information we have gleaned cannot be fit to be called circumstantial let alone concrete.”<br />
“Very well,” Jehovah nodding; “they are to be set free forthwith. I expect a full report detailing your findings by the end of the day. As for you Kusheil,” Jehovah stroking his beard; I have no choice but to relieve you of your duties. And under the newly passed law,” Jehovah staring at the alabaster skinned angel; “I order you to turn over your harem to the palace guard.”<br />
<br />
“What new law,” Kusheil not realizing that he was just sacked from the inquisition.<br />
“Jove’s law,” Jehovah smiling; “it forbids the possession and or collection of angels; be they once human or demon for the purpose of possessing a harem.”<br />
“You can thank my brother for that,” Jesus chuckling.<br />
“Never,” Kusheil feeling enraged; he tries to storm the dias and attack Jehovah only to be intercepted by Sanalphon. Kusheil is stunned as to how strong the angel is and is finding quiet to his detriment the he cannot wrestle from her grasp.<br />
“Semyaza,” Jehovah looking at how unhinged Kusheil currently is; “I owe you an apology. If Kusheil hadn’t tried to attack me just now, your report might have been viewed with suspicion. Sandalphon please escort Kusheil to a prison cell,” Jehovah sighing; “if that will be all.”<br />
<br />
Semyaza bows as he leaves the chamber.<br />
‘Couldn’t have planned it better than that,’ Semyaza smiling as he leaves the palace. ‘Now to comfort Jove as he is most likely taking the new law hard.’<br />
Semyaza flexes his wings as he takes flight, heading to the inquisition headquarters before they are closed; he needed to acquire a few items before he begins his next phase.<br />
‘Now I just need to feed Enoch a bit of info on Nergal and possible suspects as to who is putting up the chaos bubble, Semyaza thinking to himself; ‘then get Jove to agree to help bring forth Typhon.’ Jove is the only angel that Semyaza knows of who can speak Pre-Sumerian.</p>
