<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle was quite pleased with what he had transformed Stacey into and even more so with his new cock. Things were going to be interesting tonight with Jess and he was looking forward to it. He was now mentally running down the list of changed girls. First was Jen who had been transformed into a cake girl, then there was Beth who Sam had turned into a chocolate cake girl, next was Jess who he had Sam turn into a taffy girl, at Jess's request he had then turned Penny into a jello girl, and finally he had turned Stacey into a living sex toy that he could control what form she took. It wasn't a bad day for him.<br />
<br />
Kyle was enjoying the feeling of power he had when he heard someone come in. He didn't like another disruption and planned on making the person pay. &quot;Stacey are you in here?&quot; he heard a familiar voice ask. &quot;Daisy sent me in to check on you. She's afraid that Kyle has gotten to you too.&quot; Well Daisy's fear was well founded.<br />
<br />
Kyle knew who had come in before he saw her. It was Monique that Daisy had sent in which made sense. Monique was just about the lowest member of the cheer leading squad, Penny being the only one lower than her. He had heard that she had refused to perform for Jen until it was apparent that she would be kicked off the squad if she didn't. Even then it was apparent that Jen hadn't been very impressed. She also had a prick of a boyfriend on the basketball team who treated her badly. As she came into sight an idea had formed in Kyle's mind.<br />
<br />
As soon as Monique saw Kyle she stammered out &quot;Wh-wh-what are you doing in here Kyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Monique was the only cheerleader who had treated him well in high school and the fear in her eyes saddened him. He wanted her to be a willing part of his plan and so said &quot;Hi Monique. I'm in here because Jess asked me to free Penny of the pain she was going through as a cheerleader.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; Monique said with a surprised look on her face. &quot;Have you seen Stacey?&quot;<br />
<br />
The look in her eye told him that she knew he had. He figured that he should be honest and said &quot;I turned her into a living sex toy whose form I can control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never could stand that bitch&quot; Monique said. &quot;Though I had to be nice to her and the mega bitch Jen. I'm glad you transformed them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you like to be part of a food girl cheerleader squad?&quot; Kyle asked.<br />
<br />
Monique thought about this for a few seconds before asking &quot;Would I still be able to move and speak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Kyle said. &quot;It wouldn't make much sense if you couldn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it sounds neat&quot; Monique said. &quot;What type of food are you going to turn me into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll find out soon enough&quot; Kyle said. &quot;First though don't answer my question. Transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was a little worried that Monique would answer but she didn't. A minute passed and Monique asked &quot;So what do you want me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you'll like what I have in mind&quot; Kyle said. &quot;First I dare you to find that prick boyfriend of your's and ask him transform or dare. Make sure that he gets both. After that you will dare him to come here and give the curse back to me in a harmless manner. After that he will transform into a red velvet cake girl with vanilla cream inside. He will be subservient to you. He will be able to move and talk. The parts that are taken will regenerate in an hour unless his movement or school work is hampered. In which case the parts will regenerate within one minute. His new name will be Lisa and everyone will know him as such and remember him as a girl though they will still remember him as he was in the back of their mind. The same goes for him. He will also have a chance to join the food girl cheer leading squad if he wants it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle paused for a moment before continuing. &quot;Of course you will come back here with him. As soon as he gives me the curse back your own transformation will begin. You will become a chocolate ice cream girl. You will be able to move and speak. No part of you will melt except in people's mouths. Any part that is taken will regenerate within an hour unless it hampers your ability to move, do school work, or cheer leading. In which case those parts will regenerate in one minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monique knew Kyle was done and went to find her boyfriend Rick. As she left Jess wrapped her arms around him and said &quot;That was nice of you. I never knew what she saw in him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you didn't think they should be together because of his personality&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Others though didn't like the idea of a black girl dating a white guy. Poor fools.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Monique knew where Rick would be. She found him right where she knew he would be, in the top bleachers to watch the cheerleaders practice since it wasn't basketball season yet. She sat down next to him and said &quot;I have a question for you Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?&quot; Monique asked. Before he could respond she kissed him deeply and wouldn't let go until the minute was up. After it was she broke the kiss and smiled before saying &quot;You get both. I'm going to enjoy this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that it's good&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
Monique just smiled and said &quot;I dare you to go to the girl's locker room and give the curse back to Kyle in a harmless manner. As soon as you've done that you will transform into a red velvet cake girl with vanilla cream inside who is subservient to me. You will be able to move and talk. Any part of you that is taken will regenerate within an hour unless it hampers your movement or school work. In which case those parts will regenerate in one minute. Your new name will be Lisa. Everyone will remember you as a girl but will also know that you were as you are now in the back of their minds. The same thing goes for you. You will be given the chance to join the food girl cheer leading squad if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Monique finished she and Rick got up and headed to the girl's locker room.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Kyle didn't have long to wait before Monique came back with Rick. He could hardly contain his excitement of the transformations to come.<br />
<br />
Rick came up to Kyle and asked &quot;Hey Kyle, transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take dare&quot; Kyle answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you to give me pleasure when Monique allows it&quot; Rick said hoping that Monique would grant him that. It was going to be bad enough being a food girl, he might as well try to get some pleasure out of it.<br />
<br />
Both Monique and Rick took off their clothes for their transformations to begin. Of course all of their hair except for the hair on top of their heads vanished leaving there bodies smooth and hairless. Kyle watched as Rick's dick shrank down to a clit and his ball sack form labia while his balls pulled inside his body. His arms, legs, hands, and feet slimmed down to feminine proportions. His shoulders narrowed as did his waist while his hips widened. His butt grew just a little bit while breasts grew on his chest ending in a C cup. His face rounded out and became smooth while his hair grew down to his mid back. Finally he shrunk to five foot four inches completing his change into a girl. Now for the next part of his transformation.<br />
<br />
Rick could feel the changes happening to him as he transformed into a girl. He knew that the next part would be his transformation into a food girl. He felt his insides turn to the red velvet cake while his bones became the vanilla cream filling. He panicked when his heart stopped beating and he stopped breathing. He calmed down a bit when he felt the vanilla cream filling fill his new womb. He felt his tongue and teeth turn into cake. He looked down in time to see his skin turn to white frosting. Two cherry chips replaced his nipples while his clit became a cherry. He couldn't see it but his hair had also changed into white frosting. And now the new memories came flooding in. Rick was now Lisa.<br />
<br />
Monique's transformation was lame compared to Lisa's. At first she felt bone chilling cold throughout her body but she quickly became accustomed to it. She panicked a bit when her heart and breathing stopped until she realized that, as food, she didn't need to breath or have a heart beat. She watched as her dark skin lightened to the color of chocolate ice cream. Every single part of her became chocolate ice cream except for her clit which became a strawberry.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked at his two newest food girls and smiled. He was getting hungry for some cake and ice cream.<br />
<br />
Jess also looked at the two newest food girls and asked &quot;Do you want to join the food girl cheer leading squad Lisa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa seemed to be thinking it over. Finally she said &quot;Yes I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you should change the rest of the squad if they want it&quot; Monique said. &quot;You wouldn't want bitches like Jen and Stacey on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that's a good idea&quot; Kyle said. &quot;The rest are practicing right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since there's only three left I don't know how much practicing is going on&quot; Monique said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll have to go talk to them&quot; Kyle said.</p>
