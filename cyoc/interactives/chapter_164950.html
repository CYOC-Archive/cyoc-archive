<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ruh could hardly believe what he was seeing. Was this some sort of living nightmare? Reuniting with a cubhood friend he hadn’t seen in ages, finally being able to share a night of passion with them after all these ages, only for them to suddenly shapeshift into all manners of beasts and species. What was happening? Where was the real Hasib?<br />
<br />
“Please, please just let me explain whats going on, I’m so so sorry for all this, I swear.” The unfamiliar human boy repeated, his face mad with blush. Even if they weren’t deep inside the bathwater, Ruh imagined their body would still be drenched with sweat given the look on their face.<br />
<br />
“Why should I even consider listening to you? You’re a shapeshifter that much is clear. Where is the real Hasib, boy? You think an apology is suitable after you decieved me and tried to have your way with me? How do I even know that is your real form, that this isn’t all just another act? There are no apologies that need to be made, only a just punishment.” Ruh snarled out in a furious anger, unsheathing his claws. He could hardly contain himself, confusion and hatred swirled up inside his mind, he wasn’t sure if he wanted to question the shapeshifter further or tear their throat out.<br />
<br />
The boy took a step back in the water, raising his arms up in a gesture of surrender. Ruh might of calmed down from this, but as his naked form began to rise out of the water, Ruh could not help but notice the still painfully erect member the boy had, a sight which served to infuriate the sphinx further.<br />
<br />
All he had felt and been feeling was a lie, fabricated by this shapehshifter... to get into the Great Pyramid... it suddenly clicked inside Ruh’s mind. A shapeshifting outsider was attempting to enter one of the most sacred grounds known to the Sphinx, for what purpose, Ruh did not know, but this madness would stop here and now.<br />
<br />
“I understand Ruh, my cause is just and I know I don’t deserve your forgiveness, but just hear me out-“ The boy stuttered out.<br />
<br />
“Enough talk deciever!” Ruh cried out, and with his claws, pounced towards the shapeshifter, ready to kill, something he himself had never done.<br />
<br />
As he lept through the air, water spraying out everywhere as his razor sharp claws grew ever closer to the boy’s neck, Ruh could only watch in slow motion as the boy’s mass began to shift once more. Skinny limbs became muscled, human skin turned green, and his entire body began to swell in size as the boy in the span of what felt like a second transformed into his orcish form once more.<br />
<br />
Soon Ruh realized he wasn’t aiming at the shapeshifter’s neck anymore, but now he was aiming towards the orc’s muscled belly.<br />
<br />
He was unable to do anything else as the orc with seemingly no effort grabbed his spread out arm with the orc’s own muscled limb and in a quick feat of reaction, the orc grappled the sphinx down to the floor, both of them now out of the bath, drenched with water and sweat, as the orc pinned the sphinx down to the floor.<br />
<br />
Ruh snarled and snapped as much as he could, but the orc had already captured him, his strong meaty arms holding his arms wide and his lower body pressing down against his, ensuring that Ruh was practically motionless.<br />
<br />
Ruh grimanced in disgust and hatred as he soon felt a large fleshy mass flop down onto his body, the orc’s member now quite roughly being pressed against his own cock.<br />
<br />
The orc was going to have his way with him again, that much was clear in the orc’s face, with eyes that burned with fiery intensity and a still present dark green shade of blush coating the orc’s face.<br />
<br />
Any minute now he was expecting to feel his captor shift himself into the proper position so that he could commit another blasphemy.<br />
<br />
Yet thankfully, no blasphemy game.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, but this is the only way you’ll listen. I don’t want to hurt you, I swear, but I’ll let you go as soon as you listen to what I have to say.”<br />
<br />
And thus, the orc proceeded to tell the Ruh, who could only quietly glare at him with eyes full of hatred and disgust, his lifestory.<br />
<br />
Ruh could barely understand what the orc was saying, their “story” long winded and prone to get get off topic, but after what felt like an eternity, Ruh managed to get the gist of it.<br />
<br />
A human whelp who had no business ever leaving his own village suddenly discovering a power to shapeshift, after meeting another human who quite quickly became their lover, they decided to track down a gargoyle here and kill it for it’s power. Such a just and noble goal indeed, Ruh thought.<br />
<br />
“If your tale is true then you’ve only earned yourself more hatred from me. We both know you’ve been avoiding the one topic I actually care about... where is he? Where is Hasib?” Ruh snarled at his captor.<br />
<br />
The orc’s face changed, throughout the orc’s entire telling, their face seemed to be a mixture of intense passion and deep embarassment, but now their face was filled to the brim with shame, an unusual sight on a orc.<br />
<br />
Ruh almost felt like a dagger had been pierced into him, and suddenly the same question he had been dying to know turned into the one question he hoped to never know the answer to.<br />
<br />
“Hasib... I killed Hasib, he was in a tent and my.... friend Hawk captured him. I didn’t want to kill him, but Hasib told me to if that would prevent me and Hawk from taking the form of someone else... his... his body is still in the tent where we found him, rolled up in one of the carpets I think...”<br />
<br />
Ruh’s eyes seemed to dull, as if a vital part of himself had just been taken forever.<br />
<br />
Ruh couldn’t think or feel, it was like a void had filled his mind and refused to leave, lest Ruh be flooded with the emotions the void kept at bay.<br />
<br />
However, before the orc could say anymore more, suddenly...</p>
