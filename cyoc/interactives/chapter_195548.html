<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>Remember those walls I built?<br />
Well, baby, they&#39;re tumbling down<br />
And they didn&#39;t even put up a fight<br />
They didn&#39;t even make a sound</i><br />
<br />
Curtis woke to the pleasant sensation of Ollie stroking his fur. He yawned and shifted on the small bed then buried his muzzle into the sheep&#39;s growing belly before grinning up. They were bathed in warmth as a ray of sunlight shone through the blinds. After their activities the night prior, they&#39;d fallen asleep in each other&#39;s arms despite the mess that they had made. Curtis realized where he was and looked to the empty bed against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Barton never came home last night.&quot; Ollie always seemed to know exactly what Curtis was thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does he even live here anymore?&quot; Curtis asked, feeling relieved.<br />
<br />
Ollie shrugged, &quot;I mean, I haven&#39;t heard anythin. His shit&#39;s still here at least. I&#39;m not complainin.&quot; He continued to pet Curtis&#39; furry head almost absently before, &quot;Yer much furrier today, by the way. Yer back is covered. From the markin&#39;s I&#39;d assume collie or somethin.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Close, but no. Curtis took after his mother, just like his youngest sister Mazie. His other sister, Cassia, was like Alan and his father--all German Shepherds.</i><br />
<br />
Curtis shook his head. &quot;Australian Shepherd.&quot; It was a simple fact. He&#39;d known it since he was a pup.<br />
<br />
<i>Feels like I&#39;ve been awakened<br />
Every rule I had you break it</i><br />
<br />
The sheep raised an eyebrow. &quot;<i>Shepherd</i>, eh? Yer not a very good one, you know. I, a <i>sheep</i>, find that I can push you around quite easily, Mr. Shepherd.&quot; He grinned as Curtis wagged his tail. The dog enjoyed being pushed around, actually.<br />
<br />
Instead of a retort, Curtis growled playfully, nibbling at Ollie&#39;s soft stomach. A mischievous look in his eye, he crept down towards his boyfriend&#39;s new sheath, making sure to maintain their gaze all the while. He made a show of sticking his tongue out before dragging it along the enlarged fuzzy balls. This produced his desired result as a blunt piece of pink flesh began to poke out.<br />
<br />
He glanced upwards with a grin as he got to work, not minding the dried residue from the previous evening&#39;s escapades. Ollie simply closed his eyes and relaxed into his pillow as his shaft extended out of his sheath. He breathed out, bleating softly under his breath as he put an arm behind his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like I can herd you where it counts.&quot; They both laughed at the god-awful line, but it fit the mood. Curtis lapped at the caprine dick idly, swirling his tongue around the flared tip and tasted the salty-sweet taste of the sheep&#39;s precum. Curtis stroked himself and was a little disappointed to find that his cock still flopped forward, still fully human, if slightly fuzzier.<br />
<br />
<i>The risk that I&#39;m taking<br />
I&#39;m never gonna shut you out</i><br />
<br />
Curtis loved making his boyfriend squirm, and the bleating vocal feedback was egging him on. He wanted to show how dedicated he could be as he pushed the blanket off of himself fully, climbing to his knees and using both hands to assist in the blowjob. His own cock throbbed and dangled below him, untouched. He found he loved running his long tongue around and beside the musky swollen balls before him, and Ollie clearly enjoyed the attention. His tail wagged proudly behind him.<br />
<br />
Finally, he took the length fully into his mouth as he continued to lick around the shaft. It fit perfectly into his muzzle as he really got to work. The sheep began to thrust into his mouth, and when Curtis felt a hooved hand press down on his head, he felt his own cock pulse as pre drooled from its tip. He held still as Ollie pumped in and out and was soon rewarded with a mouthful of salty fluid. He looked up through his eyebrows as Ollie&#39;s face contorted in pleasure. He grunted and bleated as he came. Curtis loved watching his boyfriend lose himself and was already looking forward to getting him off again as he lapped at the spunk, making sure to swallow each and every drop.<br />
<br />
<i>You&#39;re everything I need and more<br />
It&#39;s written all over your face<br />
Baby, I can feel your halo</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Good Boy,&quot; Ollie was likely joking, but the praise went straight to Curtis&#39; dick as he panted dopily. &quot;When did you find out about yer breed, by the way? Did the dogs last night tell you or somethin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis shook his head as he resisted the urge to stroke himself again. He hoped Ollie would take care of him next, but he could be patient. &quot;No, my parents had the talk when I was a pup. I was worried that I wasn&#39;t actually related to my brother or dad because they were German Shepherds.&quot; Ollie gave him a strange look as he continued, &quot;I took after my mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about that, Curt? Like, absolutely sure?&quot; Ollie&#39;s eyebrows were knit with concern.<br />
<br />
The dog blinked and shook his head as his thoughts cleared again. &quot;Wait no. Whoa...&quot; He sat back on his knees. &quot;What the fuck? It was so clear. It hasn&#39;t been that strong before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie didn&#39;t respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was talking to Dare about that last night before Frisbee. Apparently it&#39;s been happening to everyone and it&#39;s getting stronger. Did you know that Milo has a new brother now? Like, on campus.&quot; Curtis rambled excitedly.<br />
<br />
Ollie&#39;s eyes narrowed as he frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you had anything happen yet?&quot; The dog was lost in his thoughts, &quot;I knew something was going on with my parents but it was so clear...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie glanced over to the picture he kept on his nightstand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ollie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie smiled and patted Curtis&#39; head before leaning forward to kiss his nose. &quot;We should probably get goin. Dare promised to help me with our homework before Anthro 101 and we still need to shower. Come on, Dog. You don&#39;t want yer new fur to be all damp in class, do you?&quot; He got to his feet and stepped into some boxers before grabbing a towel. He disappeared into the hall as Curtis sat alone on the bed, his dick softening in confusion.<br />
<br />
