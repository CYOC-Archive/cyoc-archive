<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she went through Damion&#39;s human profile, still clueless to what she had, June continuously asked herself why her nephew had designed such a programme. Going back through the information, thinking again about her nephew&#39;s habits, she asked herself, &quot;Is this all this is? Some way for the little fucker to live out having sex with a cat without actually going out and engaging in inter-species erotica?&quot; as she flicked through the information.<br />
<br />
Still not understanding any of it, she figured she&#39;d confront Damion about it. Deciding to wait until the young man had woken, as there were other things she needed to speak with about, such as how it was time he moved out, she scrolled back up. Clicking on the option to generate a new saved pre-set, she then clicked on the sex and gender information, she flipped both to female as she considered her own life.<br />
<br />
Had her husband Nelson not run out on her, she wondered what her life would have been like. &quot;Would they have taken Damion in after his mother disappeared,&quot; she asked herself and thinking about the child she&#39;d always wanted, but never seemed to be able to have, she reduced Damion&#39;s age down to ten, changed her mind, and switched it to eight. Wondering how to create a new profile, she considered deleting the changes she&#39;d made, but instead changed his height to four foot one inches and his weight to fifty-five pounds.<br />
<br />
Mind going to work, much in the same way she completed everything she had to do at the two businesses she owned, June altered Damion&#39;s hair to a medium brown shading, lengthened it so it was down past the small of his back, then changed his eye colour to green. Thinking about the child she always had wanted, settled on how she would have loved to have had a daughter, June considered names before, without realising she had had a little girl with such a name, she changed Damion&#39;s name to Tanya. Getting into the groove, June became caught up in what she was doing, and as such, it didn&#39;t cross her mind she was messing with Damion&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
With what she saw as the basics of age, height, weight, hair and eye colour laid down, she turned her attention to other things. Inputting data, she set it so Tanya was a girly-girl type of person and hardly ever engaged in tomboyish behaviour. Thinking this over, she told the programme Tanya loved wearing dresses and skirts, and nearly always wore them, with only a handful of occasions when she didn&#39;t. Setting her interests as ballet and gymnastics, June also added Tanya took classes in both from the age of six to twelve, deciding six was a good number of years. Finishing with this bit, she went back to add how Tanya, if she wasn&#39;t wearing a dress or skirt, would choose jeans, leggings, denim rompers and bib-overalls which she’d always wear a bodysuit with snaps in the crotch with, as well as shirts of varying sleeve length. For shoes, she gave what she was starting to see as her daughter a like for slip-on type shoes, heels when she was old enough to wear them, and sneakers, but a strong dislike for boots of any kind.<br />
<br />
Just about done with the clothes options, she went back to add, besides the bodysuits, Tanya would wear, both when young and older, panties with images printed on them, briefs as child, and thongs and bikini-style briefs as a teenager and adult. Satisfied with this, June told the programme the girl would be drawn to body-style swimsuits as a child and then, as a teenage and adult, two-piece, bikinis. Seeing as she typed all this in an option for bras, June mulled over the information before deciding Tanya would wear training bras at first, then, as she got older and her breasts developed, she’d wear strapless bras, as well as sports bras when needed. Lastly, she entered how Tanya would wear tights as a child, but, as she got older, she&#39;d move away from them, but would never feel the need to wear pantyhose unless absolutely necessary.<br />
<br />
Questions began to circle her mind, and pausing in what she was doing, June thought the most important one was why was she was doing this. The programme offered a chance to design the child she had always wanted, but never had. Beyond this, it wasn&#39;t good for anything but the heartache she always felt when she considered the lost chance, and how she&#39;d ended up saddled with her sister&#39;s child instead. Thinking she ought to end what she was doing, put it all behind her, she scrolled back up, looking over all she&#39;d typed.<br />
<br />
Close to closing the programme, she instead decided to finish what she&#39;d started. Putting Tanya&#39;s max height at five-foot, three-inches, two inches shorter than June&#39;s height, she also told the programme the girl would be thin and small, with her max weight being a hundred and twenty, with only a mild fluctuation giving some drop in weight by two or three pounds, with the only increase she&#39;d experience was if she ever became pregnant, but, after she gave birth, her body would drop down to its usual weight and body size. Satisfied with this, she set Tanya&#39;s intelligence at a max of one hundred thirty-nine, and gave her a future eight-year college degree, something June had always wanted, but couldn&#39;t even take a two-year course because of Damion and now because of the businesses she owned and operated. Mulling over what the girl would study, June settled on palaeontology, after which, she went back and adjusted a slider so Tanya would be girly, but not a total girly-girl, and her one tomboyish habit, by societal standards, was her love of dinosaurs, as well as fossilised plants.<br />
<br />
A quick scroll through the information she&#39;d provided, and again, she considered deleting it. But, at last moment, she changed her mind, and added, in addition to her love of ballet, gymnastics, plants, and dinosaurs, Tanya liked and was interested in horses, pastel colours, unicorns, Anime, rainbows, Hello Kitty, reading, fairy-tales, and left it open from there, figuring it would be best for a child to also self-discover for themselves their interests and like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if this is all just make believe,&quot; June thought as she typed how Tanya disliked Barbie dolls, video games, slackers, dishonesty, rudeness, thieves, harming animals liking these last two, as it went against things she knew Damion did, and, similar to the likes and interests, she left it open with an option of self-discovery.<br />
<br />
A sense as if she was done coming over her, June went back through all she&#39;d entered. Re-reading it, still thinking she ought to delete it, she left the option for the finances alone, guessing it&#39;d be okay if the girl did exist, she&#39;d have options when she reached the age of twenty-one. Discovering areas greyed out, June didn&#39;t understand why, and after trying a couple things to access them, she decided to leave them alone. When she located a slider for the girl&#39;s menstrual cycles would be a light to a few being medium flows. Seeing an option for who and what she’d be sexually drawn to June, thought about it before, in a slap in the face to Damion, she set Tanya’s sexuality as drawn to humans, and she’d be bi-sexual. Afterward, scrolling through the many different options, clicking, sliding, and typing information to round out who this imaginary girl could have been, all whilst thinking it was doing nothing but feeding into her longings and heartache, June stopped when she reached the end of the page. Seeing an option to save, she was about to click on it, when she paused upon spotting an option for awareness, which was still set for her and her nephew.<br />
<br />
Still unsure what the point of it was, as, so far as she grasped, no one would ever see what she drafted. &quot;Especially if I decide to delete it all,&quot; she reasoned, she toggled through the options before leaving it so only she and Damion were aware. Clicking on the save, she was given a choice to sync the new pre-set to the emitter, and still unaware of what she was doing, she told it to do so.<br />
<br />
Next to the laptop, the remote hummed, buzzed, and vibrated. Ejecting it shortly after it finished, she picked the device up and scrolled through what she&#39;d created. Still conflicted about what she&#39;d done, she tapped on a few things, altered a handful of things she’d missed whilst working with the laptop, and sighing after some time, she sniffed, &quot;This is a waste of time,&quot; before trying to get the stuff on the remote to go away. Wanting it gone, she came close to dropping it when it suddenly began to vibrate in her hands, and like before, June thought, for a split-second, she saw a loading bar. But then it was gone and she was again looking at Tanya&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
Her heartache grew at the thought of what she&#39;d never have, and with a sigh, worked out how to turn off the emitter. Taking it and the laptop, she headed for her room, where she proceeded to lock them in her closet. Satisfied this was the best option for the time being, she went to figure out what to have for dinner and what to do afterward whilst she waited for her nephew to wake.</p>
