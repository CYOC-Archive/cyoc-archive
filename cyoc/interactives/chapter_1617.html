<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What goes up, must eventually come down.  Objects flung into the air, even into space, become the victims of gravity at some point.  Empires all across the world rise and fall...
<br>

<br>
Across the nation, things were getting worse.  The situation at the university had caused a large stir among many of the religious communities.  Some believed that The End was only a breath away, and had begun to store food in preparation.  
<br>

<br>
Hoarding soon turned to riots.  Then people began to disappear.  Clothing was found, torn to pieces.  Some of the people were found, or at least parts of the bodies were found...
<br>

<br>
And back at the University, the local town folk were getting mighty pissed off at the military intrusion upon their college.
<br>

<br>
And once word of the failed gun battle spread, the entire town, about 5,000 people, took to the streets in protest, marching as a large posse.  
<br>

<br>
The atmospheric phenomenon was growing.  For miles now, the extreme heat spread across the area under the cover of a blackened sky, which itself was growing.  
<br>

<br>
The marchers were ordered to turn back, but did not do so.
<br>

<br>
Colonel Arnquist was essentially yelling at the crowd to return to their homes, or he would call upon the President to invoke martial law.  But his Major soon gained his attention, with a report from one of the snipers.
<br>

<br>
The two missing soldiers had been found, and were now themselves hostages.  Through the scope, the sniper had a general view of what was going on.
<br>

<br>
There were about 4-5 wolf creatures in the room, standing around the window, and the two men were both sprawled out on the floor, their armor removed.  Two of the wolf creatures approached the semi-concious men, and slowly began to remove their clothing.  Pants first, then undergarments.
<br>

<br>
One she-wolf grabbed the mans penis fully in her hand, and began squeezing and massaging the organ, until it became erect.  Once fully erect, the she-wolf mounted the first man, while the other one laid on top of the 2nd man.  
<br>

<br>
They were mating....  Perhaps to produce offspring?
<br>

<br>
The sniper watched on intently, as strange things began to happen to both men.
<br>

<br>
They were beginning to change too.  The sniper could not get a great view of the 2nd man, but the 1st was quite visible now.  His legs began to grow, becoming muscular and covered with hair, as the first she-wolf left him on the ground to watch his changes.  His limbs were flailing as he transformed.  A large tail grew from just above his bum, as fur spread over his body.  His feet began to lengthen as his toe nails became claws, eventually shredding away his greenish-blue socks.  His ears grew out to points, his penis became enclosed in a sheath, as it grew towards his stomach.  
<br>

<br>
His whole body was covered in fur now, as his face stretched out, and the final changes asserted theirselves upon him.  The same thing had now happened to the second man.
<br>

<br>
One of the she-wolves was standing in front of them, bold and beautiful thought the sniper, and appeared to be talking to the two new werewolves.  
<br>

<br>
Suddenly, the first man was struck over the head, and his paws bound together, and tied to the wall.  The second man stood up, in front of the window, with a proud look in his face.
<br>

<br>
He then howled out loud, and his body began to change once again.  His tail grew longer, as his penis began to shrink.  It pulled away from his body, and retracted into is groin, leaving a slit in its place.  
<br>

<br>
Two lumps on his chest began to balloon out, into breasts, with 3 more pairs of nipples forming below his (or rather her) new breasts.
<br>

<br>
The she-wolf looked very similar to the others now, the only difference being her fur pattern.  The new she-wolf embraced with another she-wolf, and slowly they began to pet one another, stroking each others breasts.
<br>

<br>
This began to give the sniper a bit of an erection, and he began to think about how beautiful the wolves were, not realizing that they were pulling him in...
<br>

<br>
The new she-wolf let out a long, loud howl that could be heard for several miles.
<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, the protesting mob started to get &quot;ugly&quot; after hearing the howl...</p>
