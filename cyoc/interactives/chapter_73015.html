<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rain intentionally kept the details of the various transformations she'd been responsible for vague.  'After <br />
all,' she figured, 'no reason to give away any more info than is necessary.  Someone might read it and decide <br />
to change things back.  I'm not sure I want to go back yet...really, all I want to know is if that's an <br />
option.  If so, great, options are always a good thing.  If not...no biggie.&quot;  Rain looked down at herself - <br />
examining her breasts, her hips, her pale, perfect skin.  She was curiously unaffected - as if the male <br />
portion of her mind was holding less and less influence over her behavior.<br />
<br />
'Huh.  I guess it makes sense - men and women have different brain chemistry - I guess it was only a matter of <br />
time before I started to get used to this being ME, and the synapses and hormones in my system adapted <br />
accordingly.'  Rain tried to conjure a mental image of Danielle and Misty acting sexy, dressed in skimpy <br />
clothing, and to her credit, she began to get slightly aroused - but only slightly.  And that was suppressed <br />
by a much more urgent feeling of wrongness.  'These are basically my sisters...they're attractive enough, I <br />
guess.  But this body must be attracted to men...'  Rain wasn't bothered by this fact - after all, she was an <br />
attractive woman, and women are normally attracted to men - but the (rapidly shrinking) remainder of Sean <br />
tried to knock that idea out of her head.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment her inbox 'dinged!' Rain opened the message with more trepidation than she was <br />
attempting to feel.<br />
<br />
'Hello Rain Blackfeather,<br />
<br />
My name is Joseph (or rather, it was) and I was an employee for TransDem Labs - developers of the Chronivac <br />
Software and Emitter Hardware.  Specifically, I was involved in the programming and design aspect of the <br />
software.  I understand you've had a bit of an accident with the product, and I want to offer some advice <br />
before you make any drastic decisions.<br />
<br />
First, I need to point out the following - you need to understand how immensely powerful the product you <br />
received was.  Without advanced degrees in software engineering, biology, and theoretical physics with an <br />
emphasis on string theory, it would be nigh impossible to explain to you exactly HOW the Chronivac works.  <br />
That said, despite some built-in safeguards, you can virtually change anything about an individual person, <br />
from a small nuance to their entire life, and everyone they know and everything in between.  From a purely <br />
ethical standpoint, this could be viewed as anything from playing God to committing murder.  TransDem Labs <br />
avoids this ethical quandary by monitoring the usage of all their products through a permanent connection made <br />
between the host IP and the main servers - should a user violate the terms of service, an agent is usually <br />
dispatched to correct all changes and collect the software and hardware.<br />
<br />
However, based on what you told me, I can deduce the following:<br />
1) You've damaged the Emitter, but no agent has arrived to collect the unit.  You've gone online and messaged <br />
me, so your internet connection is working.  This means that Chronivac 4.0 must not connect correctly on every <br />
system - yours included.  Meaning that, while the program and the emitter was working, TransDem wasn't <br />
monitoring your use - as far as they're concerned, you haven't even gotten the package yet.<br />
2) The Chronivac Failsafe Code, however, IS working.  In the event of catastrophic software or hardware <br />
failure, this failsafe creates a field around you (and anyone changed by you), filtering your perception with <br />
that of an alternate universe wherein TransDem labs doesn't exist, and the idea of a Chronivac is merely <br />
fiction.  The reason you were able to find my post and we're able to converse about it is because I too am <br />
having my perception filtered through that same alternate universe.  For good measure, the failsafe code also <br />
erases any trace of the program from your system and clears your browser cache.  Dumping a glass of water and <br />
killing your system would qualify as a catastrophic failure.<br />
<br />
So, what's this mean for you?  Well, first, the bad news - you're stuck this way.  I hope you picked a form <br />
you're fond of, because it's going to likely be you for the rest of your life.  Since TransDem wasn't <br />
monitoring, there's no way they have a backup of your original profile, and the failsafe code would have <br />
erased it.<br />
<br />
The good news?  This may sound of small comfort, but being stuck as you are really isn't so bad.  The failsafe <br />
code alters the perception of everyone you come into contact with so they only remember you as you.  Moreover, <br />
it sounds like your profile was closed when the crash happened - a Failsafe worthy failure with an open <br />
profile leads to unfortunate complications.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to lie to you - when we tested crashing the program with an open profile, a lot of our test <br />
subjects were subjected to some horrible outcomes.  Some people wound up turning inside out, some turned into <br />
adult-sized fetuses, some had their memories completely erased and wound up vegetables.  Others still wound up <br />
becoming monstrous abberations of human beings - chimeras of different people, animals, extra-dimensional <br />
beings, etc.  Some blinked themselves out of existence, and some, under the weight of such massive reality <br />
altering energy, collapsed into themselves, being piles of semi-sentient jelly.  We did what we could to set <br />
all of these people right, but a few were past saving.<br />
<br />
Then, there were those who didn't have immediately noticeable changes...these, in my opinion, were the <br />
scariest of our test subjects, because neither they nor we realized the power they wound up inheriting until <br />
after they found a way to manifest itself.  Some of it was real super-hero stuff - flight, x-ray vision, <br />
advanced healing, telekinesis, things like that.<br />
<br />
Some of it was far scarier.  Some of our subjects wound up having their profile cross-link with the Chronivac <br />
Master code.  We had a few subjects who wound up involuntarily taking on the characteristics of whoever or <br />
whatever they spent time around.  People melded with chairs, with pets, loved ones.  Others wound up trading <br />
aspects of their physicality and personality with people they touched.  Some could alter the minds and <br />
perceptions of people, changing memories (and reality) how they saw fit, simply by having a conversation.<br />
<br />
Some people became Cloners - they would wind up completely and instantly overwriting another person with an <br />
exact copy of their profile, down to the memories and mannerisms just by touching them.  When we found out <br />
about it, we could fix the Cloner, but the Victim was gone forever.  In my opinion, the Cloners were the <br />
scariest, because their victims were completely overwritten - there was no profile to go back and fix or <br />
change, <br />
<br />
Finally, we had one person become a living Chronivac - by enacting sheer force of will, he was able to do any <br />
and all of the above to himself and others.  Thankfully, his mind remained intact, and he's used his power <br />
responsibly...for the most part.<br />
<br />
I tell you this so you'll exercise more caution in the future.  Especially with something of this power and <br />
magnitude.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you, Rain.  I hope you enjoy the life you've made for yourself.<br />
<br />
Joseph(ine).'<br />
<br />
Rain began breathing heavily, reading and rereading the last several paragraphs.  'Did I close all the <br />
profiles before getting up?  Did I close ANY of them?'</p>
