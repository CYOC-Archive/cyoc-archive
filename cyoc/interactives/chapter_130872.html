<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leaving the hospital, Dymixious&#39;s father, Mr. Drake, remained in a quiet and frustrated mood. The killing of Lionel Ulysses had created all sorts of problems, but they really weren&#39;t problems that he hadn&#39;t dealt with before. While rogue weres weren&#39;t common, they DID happen from time to time, and for various reasons. Just as every normal human wasn&#39;t a criminal but SOME were. The great difference was that a rogue were had greater strength than a human being and had the ultimate end potential to spread the were-virus like a plague, that would be uncontrolled if that rogue left a bunch of incomplete weres behind him. This had been the greatest single threat to weres everywhere, and it was for this reason that Mr. Drake took on the role of privately seeing to the policing of any and all potential rogue weres and prevent them from exposing those that were no threat to anyone.<br />
<br />
Of course he new the world was changing. It wasn&#39;t like the way it was when he joined were society. Back then he&#39;d been a young English nobleman with a thirst for adventure when he&#39;d found a young female Werekomododragon trapped on a beach with her legs trapped under a huge pile of rocks. She never attacked him, but she looked terrified which honestly puzzled him at the time, as despite being female, she looked easily stronger than him and he carried no sword or gun, which meant that any attempt on his part to kill her would have only saw him killed by her greater strength. He eventually freed her and patched her wounds and did his best to talk with her. She said her people had exiled her for thievery, but she&#39;d only been hungry and she hadn&#39;t hurt anyone. This only inspired him to learn more about her, and the more he did so, the more he began to feel sympathy for her. He bandaged her and managed to smuggle her aboard the ship he&#39;d been on. People talked, but then they always did, and he did fall in love. He allowed her to turn him and she bore him Dymixious, who he loved, but when he was five, and visiting the island of his mother&#39;s birth a different rogue were killed her and a good many of the ship&#39;s crew before Mr. Drake killed that rogue... Mr. Drake ultimately had to kill the rest to protect the were secret, for those men were terrified and didn&#39;t listen to reason.<br />
<br />
The world was no longer like that, but the were secret and the threats of its exposure remained, which had driven him to teach Dymixious the rules of being a good Lord Protector. He&#39;d managed to hold onto his titles in the UK, largely through what would be considered backdoor channels that often claimed being the descendent of his &quot;predecessor&quot; in a noble line of the House of Drake. And in that, he traveled the world following any supposed stories that might indicate a rogue were and thus the threat of weres being exposed, and in this he taught Dymixious how to fight and to recognize the very hard choices that had to be made and were irrelevant to normal human society, regardless of its progress.<br />
<br />
However, the progress of human technology was something that was a problem. And the death of Lionel Ulysses ultimately proved that. While Dymixious could easily overpower the guard officer, it was never expected that he would have to, and as a result it would take some time for the hospital to learn Ulysses had died and by the time that happened, they&#39;d think it was a doctor inside the hospital. By the time anything could turn toward anyone outside the hospital memories would be too faded to have ever figured out who &quot;Dymixious Drake&quot; was. That would then mean that he never would have had to send his son and his pregnant wife to Moon Lake to escape the manhunt that followed and that his lineage could go on. The doctors being mistaken on the gender and number of children was an error but that was more normal and one Mr. Drake could live with. The mistakes he could less easily deal with was what had gotten his son killed, as that seemed to relate to the mistakes that had lead to the manhunt in the first place. Mr. Drake blamed some things on himself, but that didn&#39;t mean he was going to absolve Moon Lake for the death of his son.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d been defending the were secret for at least two centuries and they did come from a noble line. That counted for more than what one isolated and lone were sanctuary did. He&#39;d found a few here and there over the years, usually by chance while following other supposed tips and stories. They&#39;d often been quite surprised to find that there were weres living outside their little sanctuary, which only showed how weres needed someone like him to keep rogues that might leave these sanctuaries before they could cause trouble. And if Moon Lake&#39;s solution to the FBI wanting his son was to kill him, then they were no better than the rogues they hunted. And that was brought him to Moon Lake&#39;s police station and meeting with the weredog before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only times I&#39;ve EVER met with anyone claiming royal lineage,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ve normally been talking with Akane Tachibana... though... this is the first where I&#39;ve had someone declare that I HAD to speak with them because of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am an old acquaintance of hers,&quot; Mr. Drake answered, &quot;and like her... my lineage is sadly not close enough to the throne to run the society as a whole...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara answered again, &quot;but she understands that as an American citizen... in her case by immigration... that noble title and birth means exactly squat before the law. I will also tell you that my family remember the greed of English nobles that hurt them during the potato famine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Drake sat quietly and said nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;All are equal before the law here, and given how old you are, you SHOULD know that,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara answered, &quot;I only agreed to this meeting to provide you with some information regarding closure with regard to your son&#39;s death and a warning against continuing such a reckless campaign... Rogues or not... human society is getting more and more technology and just going around killing rogues is going to be just as risky as the rogues themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that excuses killing my son?&quot; Mr. Drake gave a low growl. He didn&#39;t transform, but his eyes were narrowed and he knew that this Irish weredog couldn&#39;t beat him in a fight regardless, but that would only hurt him and his lineage, especially when there was a lot he didn&#39;t know about what happened. The newspapers, both the local Moon Lake paper and the main Seattle papers reported that his son had provoked the fight, but then so many of the other cop shootings had included the cops claiming that the dead man provoked the fight.<br />
<br />
Chief O&#39;Hara breathed deeply and said slowly, &quot;No... but killing him was NEVER planned. The intention was to arrest him and if all went to plan, we&#39;d have him in custody. If the FBI found his trail to Moon Lake, we could give the case that we had him in custody and could file the legal claim for jurisdiction in the case. It&#39;d still be a Federal case, but the trial would happen HERE in Moon Lake and your son could remain safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not free,&quot; Mr. Drake answered, &quot;Free to protect towns like yours from rogues wandering around outside your little sanctuary. What are you going to do when some rogue is caught transforming on camera to attack someone? No human will respond well to that, regardless of whatever little &quot;emergency plan&quot; you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We cannot come off as though we are tolerant of vigilantism, which is what you and your son could classified as doing before any of the world&#39;s governments,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara said slowly, &quot;if you keep this up, Mr. Drake, they WILL catch you... and after what happened with your son, you might end up being the first they come talking to if something like this happens again. And eventually you won&#39;t be able to win the entire fight... and that could well classify you as a rogue as far as Moon Lake is concerned. Keep THAT in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Drake frowned at that, but said nothing. Little towns like this generally didn&#39;t know anything about the outside world or the hard decisions that had to be made. Some knew more than others, but even they weren&#39;t enough to understand those sorts of problems. Mr. Drake was well aware of that from his own personal experiences, and as a cop, he was sure that the police chief was simply repeating what he&#39;d been taught at the police academy, likely run by the state of Washington or potentially the city of Seattle as it was a bigger city, and thus couldn&#39;t possibly know about protecting the were secret around the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as I said, there was no intention of trying to kill your son,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara continued, &quot;that was more the consequence of when he attacked my officers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Drake watched as Chief O&#39;Hara stood up and walked to a television and that was set up and plugged into the far wall. He heard a few series of clicks as O&#39;Hara turned on the television and placed a DVD into the television&#39;s player that was mounted into the side of the television. Mr. Drake sat quietly the attempted arrest of his son was played before him, complete with audio. He watched as his son overreacted and then attacked, hitting one officer in the ribs with his tail and biting another. In many ways they were the precise moves that Mr. Drake had taught his son to use in tight situations to make sure the were secret stayed secret, though he didn&#39;t expect his son to use those skills against law abiding weres. He sighed as that really didn&#39;t leave him too much choice but to accept what had been reported, that for the officers it was self defense.<br />
<br />
The only thing that was really left was put together the last pieces of the puzzle with regards to how his son&#39;s stay in Moon Lake was handled. Yes, it appeared that Dymixious had crossed lines, but then perhaps he was not told on the rules the town expected or that they may have to take certain actions, particularly when he&#39;d called in old favors. America or not, Akane Tachibana had agreed to a deal with him and he would hold that woman to it as long as they lived. Long life spans and long memories did not fade easily.</p>
