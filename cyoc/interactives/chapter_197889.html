<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning came, and Jamie sat up and stretched.  Her new body felt amazing!  She bounded out of bed, and stood in front of her mirror.  As much as she hated to do it, going to school looking like a middle schooler wasn&#39;t going to fly.  She pictured her normal appearance, and felt her body begin to change.  It was like flexing a muscle, and she realized she would need practice.<br />
<br />
Still, her normal appearance was easy enough for her.  She even managed to make a few changes- she enjoyed her new hair and eye color, for example, and made a few adjustments to her complexion and figure.  She considered making the height of her default identity shorter, but that would require more shopping.<br />
<br />
She had the ability to create clothing, but she needed Kelly&#39;s fashion expertise for that.  For now, she texted Kelly and asked what color would be good for her.<br />
<br />
Kelly responded with a suggestion for navy blue, and Jamie conjured up clothing in a similar style to the outfit Kelly had bought for her in that shade.  Frowning, she tried again, with a lighter shade of blue.<br />
<br />
Perfect!<br />
<br />
She went to the kitchen for breakfast, only to find her stepmother, Terry there.  Terry was only in her 30&#39;s, and dressed like a younger woman.  She was always exercising, dieting, and spending a lot of money to try and turn back the clock.<br />
<br />
“Where did you get the money to buy that outfit?”  Terry narrowed her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Oh, a friend bought it for me.”  Jamie answered, off-handedly.<br />
<br />
“A boyfriend?  So that&#39;s how you&#39;re going to get by in life?  Sleeping with whatever loser you come across?”  Terry sneered.<br />
<br />
Gemory had said she had someone to deal with Terry, but Jamie lost her temper.  “Oh, you mean like you do?  I know you don&#39;t give a damn about Dad- you&#39;ve been cheating on him, after all.  As soon as you find someone richer, you&#39;ll dump him anyways, right?”<br />
<br />
“How dare you, you little bitch!”  Terry got up and looked ready to strike.<br />
<br />
Jamie just glared at her with her new amber eyes.  Terry looked confused for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Wh...what...what are you doing?”  Terry didn&#39;t understand what was happening.<br />
<br />
“You are now under my power, Terry.  Watch.  Raise your right hand.”<br />
<br />
Terry rose her right hand.<br />
<br />
Jamie grinned.  “Now, slap yourself.”<br />
<br />
Terry slapped herself.<br />
<br />
“See?  You have the willpower of a goldfish.  Now, this is what you are going to do.  You&#39;re going to stop cheating on Dad.  You&#39;re going to be a good little housewife.  And you are never going to speak to me again.  Now, forget this ever happened.”<br />
<br />
Terry watched the girl leave, wondering why her face was hurting.  She couldn&#39;t bring herself to talk to the girl, and felt the urge to call Steve and cancel their date tonight...hm, and the house could use some cleaning..<br />
<br />
<br />
Jamie got onto her bus, and all eyes were on her.  Not only had the rumors been flying, but the difference between her behavior now, and what it was mere days ago, was like night and day.  Jamie felt more confident, and tried to match Kelly way of walking.<br />
<br />
One thing that Kelly did well, was literally ooze confidence.<br />
<br />
She moved to a seat in the back, and got out her phone.  At the next stop, a bigger boy walked up and told her to get out of his seat.  She merely looked up at him and told him to go sit with the little kids, where he belonged. <br />
<br />
He got a strange look on his face, and moved to the front.  What Jamie didn&#39;t know was that Minuet had accidentally given her a much stronger hypnotic ability- she was a prototype after all.<br />
<br />
This meant that Jamie was a walking violation of the current Heaven/Hell treaty.  But we&#39;re sure that will never be a problem at all...<br />
<br />
As she got off the bus, several younger kids impulsively hugged her.  She was happy to return the hugs, telling them to all have a good day.  It would have been an easy meal, but she didn&#39;t care for draining kids.  She had bigger fish to land.<br />
<br />
A few girls actually gave her compliments on her new look, especially with the blonde streaks.  They assumed it was a dye job, and Jamie didn&#39;t disabuse them of the notion.<br />
<br />
Finally, she got a class with Kelly and sat down next to her.<br />
<br />
Kelly&#39;s eyes almost popped out of her skull.  “Jamie, you look gorgeous!”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.  I was hoping we could go shopping again.  I need more fashion advice.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, of course!”  Kelly looked dazed, but happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite her new look, at lunch, Kelly was still the star of the table.  Which Jamie didn&#39;t mind one bit.  Kelly was beginning to get a reputation as someone who looked out for people, and she&#39;d stopped another bullying incident earlier that day.  <br />
<br />
The actual popular kids were mostly glaring at Kelly, but she didn&#39;t seem to care.  She simply whispered to Jamie.  “Am I doing good?”<br />
<br />
Jamie placed her hand on top of Kelly&#39;s and smiled.  “Yes, I&#39;m very proud of you.  I hope you like your reward.”<br />
<br />
<br />
After school, Jamie, Kelly, and Rachel once again returned to the mall.  “I have something I want to show you guys.  Well, two somethings.  But we need to go to someplace private.”<br />
<br />
Rachel thought a moment.  “There&#39;s bathrooms on the other side of the mall, where J.C. Penny&#39;s was.  There&#39;s no open stores there.  Though they might be locked.”<br />
<br />
Kelly grinned.  “Leave that to me.”<br />
<br />
Sure enough, when they got there, they were locked, but Kelly produced some lock picks and easily opened the door.  <br />
<br />
“When did you learn to do that, Kelly?”  Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh you know me, I love getting into places I shouldn&#39;t.”  Kelly smiled.<br />
<br />
Once inside, they turned on the light, and locked the door behind them.  Jamie walked to the center of the room.  “So, first off, I have to say something you might find hard to believe, Rachel.  Do you believe in the supernatural at all?”<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded.  “Like, magic and ghosts and stuff?  Yeah, I do.  I know it&#39;s probably all fake, but...it would be nice if it wasn&#39;t.”<br />
<br />
“Well!  Let me tell you, demons and angels are quite real.”  And she then told the story about her pact with Gemory, and the magic ring.<br />
<br />
Kelly held up the ring.  “It&#39;s true.  With this ring, I have to do anything Jamie asks.”<br />
<br />
Rachel gasped.  “You&#39;re a slave!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, and I want to be.  I was a horrible bitch before, you wouldn&#39;t even recognize me, Ray.  But ever since I got this, my eyes are open.  I realize what I was, and I want to be better.”<br />
<br />
Jamie noted the use of a pet name.  They were becoming close very quickly!<br />
<br />
“I...I believe you, but still...you have to do everything she says?”<br />
<br />
Kelly nodded.  “Yes.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll show you.  Kelly, take off your blouse.”<br />
<br />
With a smile, Kelly did just that. <br />
<br />
Rachel blushed and tried to look away, but Kelly stopped her.  “No Ray, don&#39;t look away.  I want you to see me.  Would you like to touch me?”<br />
<br />
Rachel looked stunned, but nodded.  Kelly removed her bra, and moved closer to Rachel, who tentatively put a hand on the other girl&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
“But there&#39;s more.”  Jamie said. “Kelly, I want your breasts to become a full C-cup.”<br />
<br />
Kelly&#39;s breasts swelled, and Rachel jumped.  “What...oh my god...Kelly, your breasts got bigger!”<br />
<br />
“With the ring, I can control her body and mind.  Kelly, I want you to shrink to Rachel&#39;s height.”<br />
<br />
Kelly shivered and her body became smaller, until she was a mere 5&#39; 3”.   Smiling into Rachel&#39;s eyes, she took the other girl&#39;s hand and placed it on her other breast.  “Like this, honey.”<br />
<br />
Jamie could see little &#39;TILT&#39; signs in Rachel&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
“I think we&#39;re losing her, Kelly.”<br />
<br />
Kelly sighed and smiled.  “Ray, it&#39;s ok.  It really is.  I&#39;m so much happier this way.  And I&#39;m happy to be with you and Jamie.”<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded slowly.  “Ok...ok.  It&#39;s weird, but...um.  I can get used to weird.”<br />
<br />
“Which brings me to my next point.”  Jamie produced the second ring.<br />
<br />
“Wait...you want me to be your slave too?!”  Rachel squeaked.<br />
<br />
“No, I don&#39;t.  This ring doesn&#39;t let me control anyone.  Whoever wears it, becomes Kelly&#39;s slave.”<br />
<br />
Kelly and Rachel stared at Jamie in shock.  Jamie noted, however, that Rachel&#39;s hands were still groping Kelly.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t have to accept it, Rachel.  But the offer is on the table.”  Jamie smiled and handed the ring to Kelly, who stared at it.<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t.  I can&#39;t ask Rachel to be my slave.”  Kelly shook her head.  “She isn&#39;t like me, she&#39;s a wonderful person.”<br />
<br />
“I want it.”  Rachel said, her voice soft.  She removed her hands from Kelly&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
“What?  Are you sure, honey?”  Kelly had a surprised look on her face.<br />
<br />
“I love you, Kelly.  I want to do anything for you.  But I&#39;m scared.  Too scared.  There&#39;s things I&#39;d never be able to do.  But if you could make me do them, then...”<br />
<br />
“Oh Ray..think about what you&#39;re saying.”<br />
<br />
“Please, Kelly?  Please let me do this.”<br />
<br />
Kelly nodded and took Rachel&#39;s hand, and slipped the ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
“Oh...wow...it feels...I can&#39;t...”<br />
<br />
“I know.”  Kelly smiled.  “Last chance to back out.”<br />
<br />
Rachel shook her head.  “No.  I&#39;m yours forever.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.  Rachel, I want your scars to go away.”<br />
<br />
Rachel gasped. <br />
<br />
“Now take off that sweatshirt, Ray.”<br />
<br />
Dutifully, Rachel removed it.  There was no sign of her abuse, her skin was flawless.<br />
<br />
“Look in the mirror, Ray.  See that girl?  She&#39;s lovely and kind and wonderful.”<br />
<br />
Rachel stared at her reflection, and started to cry.  Jamie and Kelly flanked her, and held her.<br />
<br />
To Jamie, the strong emotions Rachel was giving off were making her feel tipsy.  She nibbled a little on the girl&#39;s feelings, to take the edge off her hunger, and to calm the girl down.<br />
<br />
Finally, Rachel smiled and hugged Kelly tightly, and the two kissed.  Jamie felt pretty good at seeing it, ignoring the voice in her head saying “Kelly is MINE!”.<br />
<br />
“So, if you&#39;re ready for another shock...”  Jamie started, waiting to get the other girl&#39;s attention.  “As of last night, I&#39;m now a demon.”<br />
<br />
“What!?”  Kelly opened her mouth in shock.  “Why?”<br />
<br />
“I was damned the instant I got your ring.  I realized we could use a second one...and I think I can help people.  Hell really isn&#39;t as bad as people say it is.  There&#39;s lots of people who go there because they were picked on.  Abused.  Driven to acts of desperation.  They needed help, and didn&#39;t get it on Earth.  That&#39;s where I plan to come in.”<br />
<br />
At hearing Jamie&#39;s words, Kelly hung her head.  “I...I was so horrible...”<br />
<br />
Rachel steeled herself and kissed her Mistress.  “But you&#39;re not, now.  You&#39;re wonderful!”<br />
<br />
“Rachel is right.  Anyways, let me show you my true form.”  Jamie transformed.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit...you&#39;re so tiny!”  Kelly blurted out.<br />
<br />
“And pretty.”  Rachel added.<br />
<br />
Jamie giggled, her clothes now hanging loosely on her shrunken frame.  Her skirt hit the floor, and her panties threatened to follow suit.  “Thank you, both.  The reason I look so young is that I&#39;m a new kind of demon.  Like a Succubus, but my job isn&#39;t to lure people into having sex.  I&#39;m about hugs and cuddles and kisses.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s...ridiculous, isn&#39;t it?  How does that bring someone to Hell?”  Kelly asked.<br />
<br />
“By itself, it doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;m a helpful demon!  Though if Hell can help someone...then that&#39;s where I&#39;ll send them.”<br />
<br />
“You look like an anime character.”  Rachel said.<br />
<br />
“I do, don&#39;t I?  I just need clothes for this form to maximize my cuteness!  See, I can make clothes now...” Jamie demonstrated by changing into the dress Minuet had given her.  “But as Kelly can tell you, I have no fashion sense.”<br />
<br />
“Hm, can you make clothes for other people too?”  Kelly asked.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t see why not.  Why do you ask?”<br />
<br />
Kelly grinned.  “It&#39;s time to do some window shopping girls- you&#39;re both getting makeovers!”<br />
<br />
<br />
It was late when they left the mall, Jamie still in her new form (minus her wings, of course).  They were all carrying shopping bags full of clothes, shoes, and makeup and other products.  Kelly was in her element, explaining how she was going to make both girls look like fashion plates.<br />
<br />
Without realizing it, she&#39;d changed Rachel&#39;s appearance again, making her prettier than before.  Her brown eyes now sparkled like gems, and her hair had gained a deeper, richer color, and was healthier than before.<br />
<br />
Jamie was pleased that her slave enjoyed her new toy.  <br />
<br />
Rachel stopped.  “I don&#39;t want to go home.”<br />
<br />
“Hon?  I thought you said your foster folks were good people!”<br />
<br />
“They are but...they don&#39;t...they don&#39;t love me.  I want to be with you, Kelly!”  The girl was crying.<br />
<br />
“Oh honey...”  Kelly held her close- something made easier since Jamie had shrunk her breasts again.  “To be honest, I don&#39;t want to go home either.”<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe we can do something about that.”  Jamie produced Gemory&#39;s business card.  “Do either of you want to talk to my boss?”<br />
<br />
“Give up my soul, so I can be with Kelly?”  Rachel thought about that, and looked at her ring.  “Yes!”<br />
<br />
“Oh honey, don&#39;t...”  Kelly said.<br />
<br />
“No, don&#39;t you see?  Magic is real!  So what if we end up in Hell?  If we can be together!”  Rachel smiled, and it made her look so adorable, Jamie resolved the girl should meet Minuet.  Kelly, on the other hand, would make a great Succubus.<br />
<br />
“I...the three of us, right?”  Kelly said.  As fond as she was of Rachel, she loved Jamie as well.<br />
<br />
“If Gemory is willing, yes.”<br />
<br />
Kelly nodded.  “Call her.  Let&#39;s do this.”</p>
