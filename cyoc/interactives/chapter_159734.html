<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Realizing there was little time Kellie, Katie and the others quickly made for the mountain. While everyone wished to save Kellies newborn, others were more cautious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rexie, Vixi,&quot; Jack stated. &quot;I want you to stay here. Protect the other children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kel I want you to do the same,&quot; Katie said to her fiance. &quot;Just in case. We need to keep Morgan safe.&quot; Although not pleased to be staying behind they understood. They needed to be cautious on case this was a diversion to take the other children.<br />
<br />
Reaching the mountain the groups now split off. Gloria and her friends would take a different path, along with the other Mika , Claudia, and Samantha. Kellie now found herself traveling with Jack, Lilith, Merlin, and her friends. Glancing over at Mika she could see the kitsune girl looked troubled. &quot;Mika you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika fidgeted, nervously gazing at her surroundings as they continued to climb. &quot;I dont want to do this,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I cant face my family in battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Mika,&quot; Kellie said warmly. &quot;I dont want this either but they&#39;ve taken my son. I need your help if I have any chance of getting him back.&quot; Mika sighed, nodding as they continued forward. &quot;What can you tell me about Fukushu?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika shuddered at the mention of her older brother. &quot;He always scared me,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Fukushu was one of the most decorated and respected warriors in our clan. Still, his heart was like ice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so,&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could always tell he did not like me,&quot; Mika said. &quot;He was aware of the deal I made with my parents. Couple that with the fact he was born a kitsune and not created he thought very little of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you didnt like him,&quot; Kellie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not it,&quot; Mika sighed. &quot;He frightened me. Fukushu is ruthless in battle. He won many a battle through sheer willpower and ferocity. He also showed no mercy. If he defeated you, he took your life.&quot; Kellie shuddered at that thought. If that were the case she, Karen, and Sebastian were lucky to be alive. Looking back she could see Lilith and Merlin following, a solemn look on their faces.<br />
<br />
While Kellie wasnt worried that Merlin would cause any issues, the same could not be said of Lilith. The demon queen had already slaughtered several kitsune before, as well as attacking Hikari. After everything she had done Kellie was now only beginning to get on good terms with them. What would happen now though that they threatened her grandson?<br />
<br />
As they rounded a corner of the path they stopped short. Their along the path stood a two tailed kitsune, a katana held tightly in his grasp as he stared the group down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shinji what are you doing,&quot; Mika cried.<br />
<br />
Shinji narrowed his eyes as he looked at his younger cousin before glaring at Lilith. All his senses told him to flee, but he needed to be brave. &quot;You can not pass,&quot; he exclaimed nervously. &quot;Especially if you are with HER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith frowned as she now stepped forward. The group had been expecting this. Before they left Mika had pulled them aside begging them, pleading with them not to harm her family. Before the hourglass had been used on her Lilith would have ignored the girl, perhaps even killing her for interfering. Now though, Lilith would honor the girls request, at least for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you have come to stop me,&quot; Lilith stated. &quot;That is brave of you boy. Brave, but very foolish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika shifted into her anthro fox form, falling to her knees in front of her cousin. &quot;I beg of you Shnji,&quot; she cried. &quot;Please dont do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shinji shifted nervously as he continued to glare at Lilith. Why had he followed Fukushu? Yes he could be rebellious but this was suicide staring down a demon. He now could only hope to delay her just a bit longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re shaking boy,&quot; Lilith sighed, gesturing to the kitsunes hands which were trembling slightly. &quot;You know what power I have. I wish you no harm at this time but, do not cross me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shinji gulped as Lilith now slowly began to approach. While this was part of the plan he still feared that everything could go wrong. Now it was up to Daichi.<br />
<br />
As Lilith approached she suddenly paused as she felt a presense. Turning quickly her eyes went wide as a three tailed kitsune now flew towards her. &quot;For Yomi,&quot; Daichi screamed as he brandished his blade.<br />
<br />
Time seemed to freeze as Kellie watched. Lilith turned, a smirk on her face as the three tailed kitsune swung his blade at Liliths neck. Before the blade could touch her though, Kellie could see it glow white hot before flying out of his hands and embedding into the mountainside. Turning she could now see Jack, his eyes glowing red as his spell to disarm the kitsune had succeeded. Now it was Bob&#39;s turn.<br />
<br />
The anthro zebra demon roared seeing his queen in danger. Moving at speeds Kellie did not think he was capable of the demon snatched Daichi out of the air. Daichi let out a groan as Bobs shoulder knocked the air out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont kill him,&quot; Mika cried as Bob hurtled towards the wall of the mountain. While Bob was under no obligation to obey Mika, Lilith had order him not to kill. Instead Bob now slammed the kitsune into the mountain leaving a sizable impact crater. Daichi groaned, slumping to the ground. The three tailed kitsune was alive but unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure hell be quite soar when he wakes up,&quot; Lilith grinned as she once more turned to Shinji. &quot;I do not wish to shed blood this day boy. You have honored yourself by making a stand, now let us pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shinji was petrified, trying to put on a brave face as he stared down the demon queen. Despite his bravado his sword hand was now visibly shaking, his sword twitching wildly as he anxiously looked at the group in front of him.<br />
<br />
Mika looked up at her cousin, she had always liked Shinji. The kitsune reminded her of Mary Elise. The black furred kitsune boy always felt awkward and out of place, his fur making him a bit of an outsider amongst the more superstitious members of his clan. It was Mika who had always treated him kindly, often following the boy when they were growing up. While Shinji would often complain about his &quot;tag along&quot; cousin, he would also make any effort to keep her happy.<br />
<br />
Mika now placed her jade paw on Shinjis, steadying his hands as he glanced down at his little cousin. &quot;Please Shinji,&quot; she whispered, tears forming in her eyes. &quot;Dont do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shinji closed his eyes, he knew he had failed Fukushu. He felt dishonored, a failure to the one person who trusted him. Mika sensed this, throwing her arms around her dark furred cousin. &quot;You did nothing wrong,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Fukushu used you, manipulated you for his own purposes. He betrayed you, and the clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shinji said nothing, sniffing he wiped his eyes as his little cousin hugged him tightly. &quot;Cmon,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Let&#39;s go talk with my parents.&quot; Shinji could only nod as Mika now motioned the other forward. <br />
<br />
Kellie watched as Mika held her cousin tightly, whispering into his ear. They had won the first battle without bloodshed or death. Hopefully now they could rescue her son without anyone foolishly losing their lives</p>
