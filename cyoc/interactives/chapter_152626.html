<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Days started turning into weeks, and there was no end in sight for Jen&#39;s curse. Fortunately, she had managed to develop a routine with Suzy: They would get together in the morning before school, meet up at lunch, and then once more after dinner to change Jen&#39;s diaper. She had gotten good at holding it until those specified times when Suzy would be around to change her. It was frustrating and inconvenient, but at least she had managed to avoid penalties. Still, she worried she would never get used to the feeling of peeing and pooping in diapers, especially when they magically appeared on her. And the infantilization that came along with it was irritating too. More often than not, she found herself drooling, compelled to suck on her thumb, or talking like a little kid. But, because of their routine, that never lasted more than a few minutes. <br />
<br />
Navigating school as a chubby girl with a cow tail was a bit harder. She had to buy a whole new wardrobe to fit her added weight, as well as ensuring any clothes that she bought could hide the tail. Because of this, Jen had stopped going to cheerleading practice, had shrunk away form gym and her other clubs. In fact, aside from Suzy, she had hardly seen any of her friends. And she didn&#39;t even think about dating with her condition.<br />
<br />
Kids being kids, rumors started. Jen could hear the snickering as she walked by, the whispers. About Jen&#39;s weight gain. About Jen and Suzy being so close (&#39;im the one who wears diapers and that seems immature to me&#39; Jen though). And they knew Jen could hear it, they did it anyway. That was the point, she supposed: to be cruel. Jen thought that maybe she deserved all this: after all, she really was quite the bully. But, as soon as she saw that, she would see Kyle walk by, that stupid fucking grin on his face, and she decided: actually, fuck this. Kyle was a creepy pervert asshole and Jen hoped that he fell into a manhole and got the mumps or something.<br />
<br />
But Jen carried on. What else could she do? Cry in her room forever? That wouldn&#39;t solve anything. And besides, as miserable as it was, Suzy was always there for her. And they had it under control. They were organized.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jen rolled around her bed, tossing and turning, yelping quietly whenever she sat on her tail. Her sleep was fitful and restless. In her dreams, Jen opened her eyes and was overwhelmed with terror: she was in some sort of prison, with pink bars around her. She noticed the soft padded surface underneath her and realized she wasn&#39;t in a prison at all! It was a giant crib! In fact, the entire room around her looked to be massive: giant rocking chairs and hobby horses, dressages that were pink and frilly, a big mobile spinning above her! She needed to escape! She tried to stand up, struggling to gain her balance as she realized she was wearing a thicker diaper than ever before, with a little hole for her tail.. She toook a few toddling steps before falling back down on her butt. As she did, she suddenly felt like crying. Why did she feel like crying? She wasn&#39;t even hurt! She let out long, wailing sobs, without really knowing why. <br />
<br />
Just then, the door burst open and her mother came in. She, too, was gigantic! She reached into the crib and plucked little Jen out and held her close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, Jenny, what&#39;s wrong baby?&quot; Her mother said, rocking her softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Something&#39;s wrong! You&#39;re huge and I&#39;m stuck in this diaper and I woke up in a crib!&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s what Jen wanted to say. But what come out was:<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaa! BBuuuguuu! Gaaah! Bahbaaggghhhh!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nothing more than meaningless baby babble. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aga?&quot; Jen asked. She thought about the words she was trying to form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ababagaaaa!&quot; <br />
<br />
She reached a hand up to her throat, trying to figure out why she couldn&#39;t speak. That&#39;s when Jen noticed her hand: it was tiny and chubby! She tried moving it, opening and closing it, and she could, but it was like all her reflexes were sluggish! She looked down at her body and saw that her normal teenage form was completely gone! No breasts, no waist, nothing at all! She quickly looked at the mirror that was on top of the dressage and she saw a little baby staring back at her!<br />
<br />
Jen began to cry. <br />
<br />
*No! I&#39;m not a baby!* she thought! *I&#39;m a big girl!*<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t even think the word adult. Jen felt herself blubbering, trying not to cry, as she was rocked back and fourth.<br />
<br />
*No! Imma big girl! I&#39;m not gonna cry!*<br />
<br />
Just then, Jen heard a hiss and felt a warmth spreading through her diaper. She had peed herself, and she had no warning or anything! It was entirely out of her control.<br />
<br />
Jen immediately let out long, wailing sobs as her mother cood her <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, there there baby...&quot;<br />
<br />
the dream began to fade as Jen&#39;s mother placed her on the changing table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get you changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the morning, Jen woke up, bleary-eyed and grouchy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck.&quot; sighed Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a shitty dream&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen shuffled around, suddenly realizing that she was wearing some sort of frilly shirt. Had she worn lingerie to bed? she didn&#39;t remember that. Then she realized: her crotch felt strangely cold. But, that was impossible. She had gotten changed last night. Nervously, Jen reached down in between her legs and pressed down, and was met with as much resistance as a damp diaper can provide.<br />
<br />
Jen flung over the covers to reveal her outfit: a frilly, pink princess dress, and a thick disposable diaper with a dinosaur print on it. The bottom of the daiper was stained yellow.<br />
<br />
Jen had wet the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh... what?&quot; <br />
<br />
She felt in between her legs again, just to prove it was real. She pinched herself, sure she was still dreaming. But she didn&#39;t wake up. She tried to tug the diaper off, but it wouldn&#39;t come off. Her tail flicked in agitation, back and fourth. Back and fourth.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No. But. I&#39;m only supposed to be in diapers when I go to the bathroom. But I... I didn&#39;t. There&#39;s no way.&quot; <br />
<br />
She felt it again. She couldn&#39;t deny it. But that doesn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t try.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way. That&#39;s.... That&#39;s not part of the curse. No way!&quot; <br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t wet the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s impossible! I--I&#39;m not a bed wetter!&quot; <br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t have wet the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m not a baby!&quot; <br />
<br />
She shouldn&#39;t have wet the bed. <br />
<br />
Panic was setting in, quickly. Was the curse getting worse over time? What the fuck was going on?<br />
<br />
As much as she hated to admit it, she needed to call Kyle. <br />
<br />
She jumped out of bed and lurched for her nightstand, but she stumbled and fell over.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; <br />
<br />
She tried to get back up, and with some effort, she did. But her legs felt shakey, and after a couple uneasy steps, she fell backwards onto her diapered butt, just like in her dream. But this time, her tail got caught. It actually hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen had never been incapable of walking. Was this new too? Or had she just gotten lucky.<br />
<br />
She crawled to the nightstand, and phoned Kyle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey baby Jenny, i thought you were learning your lesson by n--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont want a fucking change from you. Why the fuck is the curse getting worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle chuckled on the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse? What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;you know damn well what I mean, asshole?<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there, little tyke. i&#39;m not a mind reader.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When why the fuck did i just wet the bed, dipshit?&quot; Jen smirked. Surely that would show Kyle.<br />
<br />
But then Kyle started snickering. And laughing. And Jen&#39;s face was flush with embarassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. My. God. You wet the bed?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s laugh stung. <br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s not funny...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Au Contraire, diaper-butt. It&#39;s fucking hilarious!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I wouldn&#39;t have done it if it weren&#39;t for your stupid curse!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle laughed for a solid thirty more seconds before answering. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, baby Jenny. I don&#39;t know anything about that. It&#39;s magic, so who the hell knows how it would affect you long term. Sorry, kiddo.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen sighed. She could tell Kyle was telling the truth. If he was behind it, he would gloat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you don&#39;t wanna ask for a change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen just hung up. She tried to get back up again, but it was no use. She was crawlng until she got a change. So she crawled back over to her bed and managed to clambor into it. Then she dialed Suzy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhh.. Jen? It&#39;s... way too early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen;&#39;s voice was quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah. I&#39;m... i&#39;m sorry. Can you come over?&quot; Jen chose her words carefully: she and suzy had learned that the penalty wouldn&#39;t take effect unless the prospect of diaper changes was directly on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for a little bit. Why don&#39;t you just wait until our meetup?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen felt tears well into her eyes and her face flush with embarassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... had an accident.&quot; She said, swallowing the huge lump in her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I woke up... in a diaper. I wet the bed, Suzy.&quot; Jen started sniffling.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey, hey, it&#39;s ok. I&#39;ll... i&#39;ll be right over.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen heard Suzy hang up, and she just began sobbing.</p>
