<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want round the clock surveillance,” Leon growling; “No one but the doctors, nurses and family come into my son’s recovery room. Do I make myself clear?”<br />
“Yes my liege,” Leon’s brother answering; “we’ll make the arraignments. But hospital security will not like being stepped on.”<br />
“To hell with hospital security,” Leon snarling; “let them bitch all they want. Until my son leaves the hospital on his own paws, we were-lions stick together.”<br />
<br />
Leon growls; as the were-lion king and father of two, the man was in an ill mood. After being outright threatened being locked up by Tachibana for confronting Frederick Parker; Leon was short on patience with those trying to argue with him. His wife sadly felt that the hard way when he roared at her for trying to get him to calm down. Not one to growl at his mate in such a fashion, Leon knew he was going to pay for it later on when he left for home. Regina was not one to take such a challenge of dominance lying down.<br />
<br />
That was hours ago. Currently, Leon was watching his son rest comfortably. Observing the daytime nurse who was a were-rabbit administer Peter’s pain medication; Leon sighed as the medication took effect, making any attempt to have a conversation with Peter all but impossible as the medication knocked him out. Passing the time reading issues of Time and National Geographic’s that were several years old; Leon looks up to see a large well-built woman come in and start writing notes on Peter’s chart.<br />
<br />
The five foot woman with and ample bosom and a killer hourglass figure was wearing a white lab coat that ended down to her ankles. Unable to see what she was wearing underneath and only getting a look at her white sneakers as she made an adjustment on the i.v drip. Leon was able to get a good strong smell of were-rabbit from this person as well.<br />
“I take it your my son’s doctor,” Leon speaking up.<br />
“Yes,” the woman responds; “Doctor Helen Tompkins.”<br />
“Just to let you know,” Leon speaking; “my son was talking about you earlier. I believe he is smitten with you.”<br />
“I’ve had a lot of patients,” Doctor Tompkins responding; “fallen for me in the past. Your son is no different.”<br />
“Despite the fact he has a catheter up his member,” Leon speaking; “Peter still got aroused from seeing you. At least that is what he told me, while his cousin Eugene was here when you first checked on him.”<br />
“Not new for me,” Doctor Tompkins giving a wry smile; “I’ve seen it all before.”<br />
“Yet how many badger your for your phone number,” a groggy were-lion slurs.<br />
“Peter,” Leon seeing his son awake and looking tired; “go back to sleep and get your rest.”<br />
“Can’t,” Peter looking at the doctor; “but can you step out of the room dad? I’m eager to have a bit of rabbit pie.”<br />
<br />
Leon looks at his son both staring at the doctor and wincing in discomfort. Seeing the large tenting on his son’s bed sheets lets the were-lion king know what his son is implying and he just shakes his head completely bemused. Doctor Tompkins also seeing Peter’s arousal however has a stone look about her face. Before Peter or Leon could react, she swiftly smacks the head of Peter’s shaft, causing the were-lion to roar in pain as the plastic tube shoved all the way to his bladder shifts, killing any chance for romance.<br />
“Now why did you do that,” Leon growling at the doctor.<br />
“It was the quickest way to ensure the catheter in your son doesn’t slip out,” Doctor Tompkins answering; “he will still need it in him for at least the evening still.”<br />
“That fucking hurt,” Peter looking none too pleased.<br />
“Consider it a small price to pay,” Doctor Tompkins grinning; “for breaking my brother’s arm last evening.”<br />
<br />
Leon looks on as the doctor leaves the room; just as members of his pride rush in to find out the source of the roar. Leon laughing as the guards realize there was no danger and see their King and Prince no worse for wear, step back outside as Peter looks at his father.<br />
“Now what is so funny,” Peter speaking up.<br />
“You sure know how to pick ‘em son,” Leon sitting down; “you are going to have a hell of a time winning that woman’s heart.”<br />
“What good is a hunt,” Peter smiling through his muzzle; “if it’s not challenging dad.”<br />
“So it’s more than just a tumble you seek then,” Leon chuckling.<br />
“Something tells me,” Peter looking serious; “that Doctor Tompkins will be the mother of your future grandcubs.”<br />
<br />
Leon looks at his son in complete shock before doubling over in laughter yet again. Unable to yet comprehend the seriousness of the comment his son made; the were-lion king just cackles and bellows in pure joy for a good while.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Helen Tompkins heads to the nurses desk to place Peter’s file back in its proper slot before turning around to see her brother staring back at her, his arm in a sling.<br />
“You should be home resting Andy,” Helen looking at her brother.<br />
“I was,” Andy answering; “but I was going crazy with nothing to do, so I came over to visit you.”<br />
“I’m still on duty for another two hours at least,” Helen leaving the ward with Andy following her; “and I still have a few other patients to check up on.”<br />
“And your recent patient,” Andy speaking to his sister; “the one who broke my arm after bringing him back from the brink of death?”<br />
“Made a pass at me,” Helen rolling her eyes; “with his father present no less.”<br />
“You mean he isn’t,” Andy managing to butt his index fingers together in a back and forth motion.<br />
“His erection upon seeing me,” Helen chuckles; “says otherwise. Peter Talbot isn’t gay,” Helen looking at his brother; “so if you are planning to play matchmaker with members of our warren, forget it. It seems the were-lion prince is only interested in your older sister.”<br />
“Your only five minutes older than me,” Andy speaking before getting cut off.<br />
“And don’t you forget it,” Helen answering; “now go home to your wife and kids, brother. I can take care of myself.”<br />
“Don’t tell me your falling for a were-lion,” Andy looking stunned; “that’s like a mongoose and a cobra living together in harmony. It’s a contradiction; he is a lion and you are-“<br />
“Compatible,” Helen cutting her brother off again; &quot;so don’t you dare try and use an argument that predatory based weres don’t get along with the prey based weres. After all, you married a were-vixen.”<br />
<br />
Andy grumbles as he watches her sister walk away to check on her next patient. Mad that he cannot come up with a valid counterpoint and even worse that she was right; Andy thought about marching over to where Peter was resting. Deciding it was best not to step in the lion’s den so to speak, the were-rabbit with a sour look on his face walks back to his car in the parking lot.</p>
