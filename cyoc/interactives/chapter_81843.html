<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...George's father.  &quot;It's you turn,&quot; I said to him.  He looked worried.  &quot;Don't be so scared.  You'll thank me for this when it's all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; he said with defeat in his voice.  &quot;Just get it over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
I contemplated what I'd do with him.  His admission of hitting his wife, even if his wife insisted it was a thing of the past and he looked genuinely remorseful over it, left a bad taste in my mouth.  I couldn't keep him as a male.  I wondered if I should turn him into a child.  That wouldn't work, either, I thought.  I was trying to form a close-knit group that I would use to help me with the new world I intended to create.  So he had to be an adult.<br />
<br />
So I decided he'd become a woman, too, but he wouldn't fare quite as well in the looks department as the rest of us.  I'd make him attractive, for sure, but not quite as attractive.  But for true &quot;punishment,&quot; I'd make him a little intellectually inferior as well.  I formed an image in my mind, complete with the slight mental adjustment, and wished that he would transform into it.<br />
<br />
The first noticeable change was his size.  George's father was about my current height, 6'2&quot;.  I was making him shrink down to 5'8&quot;.  That would make him shorter than the rest of us.  He immediately noticed the change as his clothes began to feel loose.  He felt around his body to see what else had changed so far.  His query was answered when he felt hair growing down the sides and back of his head.  He grabbed a few strands with his hand and watched with wide eyes as his hair thickened and lightened to platinum blonde.  I decided that if he was going to be a little less smart he might as well be a blonde.<br />
<br />
Then he grabbed at his face with both hands and ended up completely covering his face.  His hands changed as they grew smaller and daintier while his fingers grew more slender and his fingernails grew longer.  After a minute or two he finally uncovered his face.  By this time his face had completely changed.  His face was completely female.  I noticed that he had longer eyelashes and fuller lips than the rest of us.  Now I was a little afraid he might turn out to be a complete bimbo.  That was not my intention.  I'd just have to wait and see.  He lightly patted at his face with his completely changed hands, and then noticed the changes in his hands himself.  His arms had also thinned.  He smiled a little and then let out a giggle, which was slightly higher pitched.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly his pants fell down to his ankles.  His waistline had narrowed so that his pants no longer fit.  His legs were exposed I could see that they were smooth, hairless and shapely.  He stepped out of his pants and in the process his feet came right out of his shoes.  He responded to this change by also removing his socks.  His feet were definitely smaller now.  I saw that his shirt was beginning to be much too big for him as well, due to the combination of his shoulders narrowing and his height shrinking.<br />
<br />
Much to my surprise he took off his boxers and left himself naked from the waist down.  His shirt was now so big on him that it covered his hips and his groin.  He lifted the shirt up above his hips to show that they had already broadened.  Meanwhile his cock quickly began to wither away.  Again I heard him giggle in a still higher pitch as his cock pulled within his body.  His genitals reshaped themselves within just a few seconds.  Once his pussy was fully formed, he did a little spin and showed off his rounded ass.<br />
<br />
Finally his shirt grew tighter around the chest as his breasts began to grow out.  He also had a button-down shirt on and as his breasts grew ever larger the buttons popped off until they were all gone.  His shirt hung open around his expanding breasts.  Eventually they settled on EE size, just like his former wife's now were.  There was a slight difference in that, due to his shorter height, his breasts did appear somewhat too large for him.  Now I was definitely worried that he'd become a bimbo.<br />
<br />
With the changes over he looked around the room at all of us.  The ruined shirt still barely clung to his, rather, her shoulders.  &quot;Hi there,&quot; she said in a voice that sounded a bit like a stereotypical California high school girl.  &quot;Could you, like, tell me why I'm here?  Or where I am?&quot;  She paused for a second, frowned, then added, &quot;Or who I am?&quot;</p>
