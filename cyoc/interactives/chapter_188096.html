<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Luna settled down into the chairs at the modest table that was in the Vaxer kitchen where Kellie had set up the board. The main box was left out on a far counter along the wall and away from the table. The only things that were on the table beside the board were the bills that were the &quot;monopoly money,&quot; and were prearranged to set up each player&#39;s starting amount with the rest in front of where Kellie was seated. That gave you the sense that Kellie would be the &quot;banker&quot; for the game, though you weren&#39;t going to fight that. There was also a small box on the open space on the table to the left of the spot where you sat down, and as you passed it you noted that the dice were in that box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the uh... box for dice?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you see, for many years there was a little girl in the family who liked to really toss the dice when we played board games,&quot; Kellie gave a smile, &quot;and they went everywhere... they&#39;d move pieces on the board, go off the table, and so on. Roxie and I had to implement a house hold rule with all board games that you had to roll the dice into the box. It got her to be more careful with how hard she threw the dice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooooooooooom!&quot; Luna protested as she put her face in her hands, clearly embarrassed, and you guessed she was probably blushing under her fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you grew out of it,&quot; you offered to Luna, thinking that would make her feel better. The glare you got in return indicated you were wrong, which only made Kellie laugh even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;She did, and in the meantime... there will be the pieces to use,&quot; Kellie answered and then gestured to the collection of figures on the table in front of Kellie. <br />
<br />
They were the standard figurines that were always used and you and Luna both looked to take those respective pieces. Though you also found that like your PlayStation&#39;s controllers, the pieces were not necessarily built for your enlarged fingers and claws in your MILF-wolf form and thus picking them up wasn&#39;t super easy, particularly as your favorite piece was among the smaller ones and you found you had to put a rather tight grip with your claws to do it. Thankfully the pieces also seemed to be made of a hard metal, which meant that while they were designed for more dexterous human fingers it wasn&#39;t impossible for you to use them, as you hadn&#39;t lost that much dexterity in transforming. You placed your piece, which was a small globe on a pedestal, while Luna set her piece, a Scottish Terrier, down next to it, while Kellie finished with her piece, which was a miniaturized version of the Statue of Liberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now the question on who goes first,&quot; Kellie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roll a die and whoever has the highest number goes first... and then rotates clockwise,&quot; Luna offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sound&#39;s fair,&quot; you and Kellie both agreed as Luna took the box with the dice in it and rolled one die getting a four. She then passed the box over to her mother. Kellie then rolled a five and passed the box to you. You then rolled a two, which let Kellie win the line of chance on who would start first. Kellie then set the box down and began to collect the game pieces that weren&#39;t selected for the game and took them over to where the Monopoly box was on the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get you two anything before we get started?&quot; Kellie offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could go for some jerky,&quot; Luna commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I actually feel a bit hungry too,&quot; you admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Post transformation hungers,&quot; Kellie smiled, &quot;I&#39;ll get you both some jerky and then we&#39;ll get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie then collected some strips of jerky from the refrigerator and then placed on napkins that she then placed for you and Luna. Both of you thanked Kellie and the game soon began. You and Luna chewed on the jerky, which actually tasted like it was home made, not store bought. From there the game soon began as the three of you took turns rolling the dice to move your pieces along the board and then selectively buying or passing on certain properties on the board. As you played, a question came to your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you say this girl&#39;s night for you and Roxie is with old friends and MILF-wolves that moved out of town,&quot; you began as you looked over to Kellie during one of Luna&#39;s turns, &quot;that kinda raises some questions for me about the pack I&#39;ve joined.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot; Kellie wondered, as Luna looked up as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... like how many are in the pack?&quot; you asked, &quot;how old are they... are they mine and Luna&#39;s age? Is there some sort of greeting I&#39;m to make when it&#39;s safe enough to meet them? How many are MILF-wolves and how many are normal werewolves? All that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid, Nicki, that you and I are the only MILF-wolves OUR age in town,&quot; Luna spoke as she passed the dice box to Kellie, &quot;some that might have left town may have become pregnant in their new homes, but that would all be after I was born and that most are at least two our three months younger than us. And most are probably years younger than us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And none of them live in town?&quot; you asked to her as Kellie rolled and then moved her piece, with it landing on a spot that Luna had already bought in the game. Kellie paid the &quot;rent&quot; to Luna and then passed the dice box on to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;None,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;though to a degree... it is not for lack of trying.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got you to look over to Kellie as you rolled the dice into the box that was used to roll the dice in. Kellie eventually continued with the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;As the pack is a mix of MILF-wolves and regular werewolves,&quot; Kellie explained, &quot;when it started... there were a few families of regular werewolves here... but most of them left after some of the attention that Roxie and I generated after becoming the first MILF-wolves. They didn&#39;t like or want the attention and thus left.&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t have known what would happen,&quot; you pointed out as you moved your piece to find that while you passed &quot;go,&quot; you also landed on a square that Kellie owned. You then carefully paid the monopoly money owed and took what you got for passing &quot;go&quot; before asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;They just left after you were bitten?&quot; you asked to Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just because I was bitten,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;more that because by becoming a MILF-wolf meant that any man that Roxie and I were with became female... that attracted a LOT of attention from people trying to figure things out. And like I said last night, werewolves will want some degree of privacy. They&#39;re not just looking to bask in attention. My becoming a MILF-wolf raised a lot of attention and most of the werewolves left to get their own sense of privacy. Not all werewolves left... but those that did did so for privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down with a bit of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Kellie assured you, &quot;and eventually things did settle down. When that happened... we had the privacy to have our fun, to hunt, and integrate with the werewolves that didn&#39;t leave. And it&#39;s been fun. Most of the pack here now are MILF-wolves, about fifteen or so, all those that have wanted to be MILF-wolves for one reason or another... some were older women who wanted to be &quot;young&quot; again. Some were &quot;furries&quot; and were willing to become MILF-wolves for the same reason they&#39;ve become normal werewolves. And if it weren&#39;t for the Wolf Hunters... Roxie and I probably would have arranged for you and Luna to meet them last night, to introduce a new pack member and showing that Luna&#39;s first transformation happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that introduction has to wait until the Wolf Hunters leave or have been arrested,&quot; Luna said slowly as she took her next turn.<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded and then looked back to you, &quot;the rest of the pack are four regular werewolves... all of whom are male, though it seems that they&#39;ve all gone out of town for this month&#39;s full moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What for?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roxie thinks it was a hunting trip,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;which I&#39;d guess means they&#39;re looking for something other than the White Tail or Mule Deer that often come around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; you said slowly, &quot;well... hopefully these things improve quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully they will,&quot; Kellie nodded in agreement.</p>
