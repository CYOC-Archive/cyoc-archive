<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ian was proud by all the good work he’d done in the little time since his own transformation.  Already the <br />
school felt like a better place with the improvements he’d made to some of the students.  He decided the <br />
vocalist should be next but that was tricky.  The singer was the most crucial and they had to sing from the <br />
heart, the lyrics had to be beautiful and true.  Not just anyone would do this time.  Ian was stumped but <br />
after some debate with the others he thought of just the guy, he wouldn’t even have to transform him, he was <br />
already perfect.  <br />
<br />
He managed to find Conner on his way to the locker-room for Gym and tapped him on the back as he had Dylan <br />
before walking away.  The only thing left to do now is wait.  Conner was a charming boy, around 16.  He was <br />
cheerful and outgoing and even what some would call cute.  He was moderately tall for his age, very lean and <br />
already showing some teenage definition with mesmerizing blue eyes and slightly curly blond hair.  He looked <br />
almost cherubic and dressed a bit preppy.  Despite his looks he was modest and kind to everyone.  In a perfect <br />
world he would have been very popular but this was far from a perfect world.  The fact that Conner was a <br />
singer for the local youth group and a poet did him no favors and won him no friends but the real killing blow <br />
was that Conner was adamantly straight edge and frequently tried to promote a clean life style.  That just <br />
didn’t work in high school and so he was the target of much bullying.  Rather then wear on him though Conner <br />
took it in stride and never dropped his smile.  As he was making his way to gym class he spotted Chad.  Chad <br />
was one of the worst.  Standing at over 6 feet tall with a joint or cig almost perpetually hanging out his <br />
mouth Chad was a hairy, lumbering Behemoth of a man.  Held back at least once he towered over everyone else <br />
and made it a lifestyle to torment those who he couldn’t bring into his circle.  Most of Chad’s friends were <br />
also potheads who he personally brought into the game and whatever they had been before they pretty much just <br />
followed their leader around like dogs, occasionally laughing at his jokes.  Mostly out of fear and stupidity, <br />
he wasn’t all that funny.  <br />
<br />
Chad considered Conner a mortal foe, spewing his straight edge bullshit all over the school like a sickness <br />
and trying to make the world fit into his morals.  Chad couldn’t stand these self-righteous types and today he <br />
was going to show Conner what was up.  He grabbed the much smaller boy by the neck and dragged him to the <br />
staircase, with the bell due to ring at any second there shouldn’t be any witnesses.  Chad made a show of <br />
presenting his unnaturally large fist before Conner’s face; he wanted to break this kid, before he broke him.  <br />
He took a good first swing and caught him square in the nose.  Conner was sent reeling backwards from the <br />
impact and slammed his head on the wall behind him.  He slumped to the ground and didn’t stir.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, oh shit…” Chad’s booming voice filled the stairwell as blood began to pour onto the floor.  He <br />
panicked what if he killed the kid?  He was over 18 he’d be tried as an adult, it was all over.  But as Chad <br />
rubbed his eyes wishing it all away, something granted his wish.  Conner was gone and there was nothing to <br />
show he had ever been there.  Taking a few deep breaths, not sure if someone sold him some bad weed or what <br />
Chad regained his composure and left to meet up with his friends.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Conner awoke in darkness.  He felt like he was wearing a heavy costume.  He could ‘hear’ all of <br />
Chad’s thoughts.  Well what passed for thoughts, they were mostly base impulses and needs.  He was thinking <br />
about going for another joint, some hot chick he wanted to bang and the parties this weekend.  Conner could <br />
feel every inch of his body from his oversized muscles to his greasy, unwashed hair.  But what astonished <br />
Conner most was he could change all of it. He felt himself spread into every corner, and set to work…<br />
<br />
Chad felt weird, distant, like he was watching his life on a movie screen.  His friends Logan and Drew were <br />
asking him if he was coming with them to get wasted as a party this weekend.  He opened his mouth to say Hell <br />
yeah…<br />
<br />
“No way!  Guys we shouldn’t be drinking, we’re underage.  It’s bad for us and sets a bad example; we can have <br />
fun without being drunk!”  Chad’s eyes were wide with shock, his friends were also shocked.  Drew laughed <br />
first, followed by Logan.  They assumed he was just joking.  Too bad he wasn’t.  Why did I say that he <br />
thought?  He could’ve sworn a voice in the back of his head replied to him.  Because I made you.  Chad shook <br />
it off and headed to the locker rooms, he was very late for gym but he didn’t give a shit.  He went into a <br />
stall to get a quick joint in before gym.  As he lit it his hand suddenly shook, like someone else was <br />
controlling it and he threw it into the toilet.  No more joints Chad, a voice said in his head.  Chad was <br />
furious, it was his last joint.  He pulled down his pants to take a piss but he felt the same sensation <br />
overwhelm him again.  Something strange entered his equipment and began changing it.  His once monstrous tool <br />
began to dwindle down to a more average size, losing length and girth.  It shrank even further becoming small <br />
and thin.  His dark forest of pubic hair even receded becoming just a small scattering of blond hairs.  <br />
<br />
“Fuck, the guys will laugh me to Hell!  What’s going on?”  Chad cringed, feeling like he was going to vomit.  <br />
This had to be a bad trip he thought but the voice in his head spoke again and this time he recognized it, it <br />
was Conner!<br />
<br />
“I’m in your body, somehow, you’ve gone around turning other people to your ways and you were cruel to me for <br />
trying to get people to live a better life and since you killed my body I’ll just have to use yours to keep <br />
helping people.”<br />
<br />
“Shit I didn’t mean to kill you!  Don’t do this; I don’t want to be the new you, why not someone else there <br />
are loads of people worse than me!”  As if in response Chad’s mind was assaulted by Conner’s thoughts which <br />
began replacing his own.  Knowledge of how to warm up his voice, how to sing, how to write began filling his <br />
head as how to roll a joint, how to have sex and how to party hard was pushed out.  Chad could only watch as <br />
he was slowly turned into the boy he once hated from the inside out.  He ran to the door but as he tried to <br />
turn the handle his hands began shrinking, becoming petite, softer.  The course hairs vanished and the sausage <br />
like appendages became more lean and nimble.  His hands continued to shrink until they matched the 16 year <br />
old’s perfectly.  The fingers moved on their own, twitching and feeling and Chad found he no longer had any <br />
control over them.<br />
<br />
“Like having my hands?  Hmmm, now what should be next?  I know!  I’ll let you pick, arms or legs?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you!  Get out of my head you mother… what the heck?  Why can’t I freaking curse?”  <br />
<br />
“Because cursing is bad, stop trying to sound cool.  Now, arms or legs?  Better say one or I’ll call up your <br />
friends right now and tell all about how you want to change your life and theirs…”<br />
<br />
“Fine legs!”  Conner didn’t respond he just went right to work.  It was almost as if a vacuum had been taken <br />
to his legs.  They were thick but not truly muscular; most of it was flab from his lazy habits.  That all <br />
started to vanish as his legs rapidly slimmed down and shortened.  Soon he was left with hairy sticks, but not <br />
for long as they began acquiring Conner’s tone.  The calves jutted out just enough and even his thighs <br />
developed nicely.  Before they were quite pale from sitting around on the couch all day but they tanned and <br />
the mess of hairs vanished to be replaced by a less dense coating of golden blond ones.  His legs were nothing <br />
to write home about but looked more like a track runners or at the very least a very active runner.  <br />
<br />
Chad heard a childish laughter in his head.  “You look funny like that, go look in the mirror!”  Chad had no <br />
chance, his body automatically walked to the mirror where his torn jeans were falling off of him revealing his <br />
legs.  His legs were nice but compared to the rest of his oversized body he looked ridiculous with little legs <br />
and small hands.  Those same hands began undressing him against his wishes causing him to blush as his <br />
shrunken equipment was revealed along with his slight beer/pot gut and hair pecs.  “Well time to change some <br />
more stuff.”  Chad shuddered as he felt Conner’s presence focus in his chest, erasing his belly completely and <br />
shrinking it into a tan, smooth 6 pack.  His small hands felt it in amazement, the tone was remarkable for <br />
someone his age.  No, he can’t be thinking like this, he can’t be enjoying this.  Somehow he’d find a way to <br />
get his body back from Conner!   “No you won’t, go on say how old you are!”  Chad tried to focus and take <br />
control.<br />
<br />
“I’m 16!”  He said jubilantly, sounding exactly like Conner usually did, just deeper.  He choked, horrified by <br />
what was happening to him and how powerless he was.  But Conner just laughed inside him and continued playing <br />
around inside his mind, stripping him of his love for weed and partying and actually forcing him to grudgingly <br />
accept and enjoy what was happening to him.  Chad was starting to feel bad about all the lives he had ruined, <br />
including his own.  If only he had a second chance to show people the right way to live.  Distracted by his <br />
changing thoughts Chad didn’t notice the last dark hairs vanishing, leaving his tan chest completely smooth, <br />
his pecs now firm if not as large as before.  <br />
<br />
“So Conner what do you like to do?”  Chad growled at the question.  <br />
<br />
“Smoke pot!”<br />
<br />
“Wrong.”  Chad clutched his ears as they poked out a little more from the side of head like Conner’s did.  His <br />
greasy hair cleaned itself and lightened to blond, starting to curl into Conner’s trademarked locks.  “What do <br />
you like to do, Conner?”<br />
<br />
“Drink and have sex!”  Chad cried out in agony this time as his nose pushed in, becoming small and round.  His <br />
cheek bones rose up and he gained a slight, permanent redness to his cheeks.  His eyes glowed bright blue and <br />
emptied of everything but sheer joy and optimism.  <br />
<br />
“I like to sing!”  He said happily.  Conner didn’t even force it, his mind was almost gone.  Even as he hated <br />
himself for saying that he knew it was true.  His arms were starting to match his legs now, with but a soft <br />
coating of golden blond hair and teenage tone.  He dropped a few more inches in height as his shoulders <br />
contracted and his frame reduced.  He would no longer be intimidating anyone.  His feet shrank several sizes, <br />
until everything was almost exactly Conner.  His face went through a few final changes as everything was <br />
cleaned up, brightened and perfected.  All traces of smoking and drinking were purged.  <br />
<br />
“Now, class is almost over Conner go to your locker and put on your clothes.”  Chad tried to resist but his <br />
bare feet moved against him towards Conner’s locker which he unlocked instinctively.  First he took out his <br />
plain, small underwear and loathing every second of it, found himself sliding it up his legs.  The touch was <br />
corrosive as if the contact was disintegrating more of what little was left of him.  By the time it was pulled <br />
into place he was gasping for breath.  <br />
<br />
“Next the cargo shorts.”  Chad struggled, but not as much, part of him already resigned.  The cargo shorts <br />
slid up faster and went right into place.  They were bright white with grey designs.  He was careful to put <br />
the belt on and tighten it so he looked neat.  He pulled out his wallet and instead of drug money found only a <br />
driver’s license with his new face on it and some pictures of him with his friends at the local youth group.  <br />
He barely resisted as Conner forced his small feet into the little preppy sandals but as each toe reached the <br />
end another piece of him died and he felt himself teetering on the edge.  He just waited as the light blue <br />
Aero shirt was lowered over his fit chest and then fit into place.<br />
<br />
“Perfect, all done!”  The boy smiled, no trace of Chad remained in him at all.  Chad was the dead one now.  He <br />
quickly left for the band room to meet up with Ian, they still had a drummer to find after all!  He left the <br />
locker room with his signature smile in place, almost skipping to meet up with his band mates and spread his <br />
joy.</p>
