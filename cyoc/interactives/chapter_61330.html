<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After leaving Roxxane into her house, Damon arrived at his own. His parents were out, so he was all alone with 
his brother Tim. "Twerp, i'm home" Damon said. Apparently Tim was so busy playing with his PS3 in the living 
room he didn't noticed his big brother arrive carrying a big box, containing the costume he got earlier. 
"Don't call me twerp!" his brother said, but he kept playing. Damon got upstairs and entered his room. He 
steadily opened the box, and took the costume out of it. It was as impressive as it was on the store: huge, 
semi-realistic, sharp claws, big frame. "Dude, i'm going to be a really bad-ass bear once i wear it" Damon 
said 
to himself. All the possibilities of what he could do with his new costume... for starters, he wanted to scare 
the hell out of his brother just for the hell of it, after that maybe arrange a surprise for his girlfriend, 
even ask the cinema manager to work there, attracting clients! It was perfect.
<BR><BR>
Just then, he realized he was really hungry: As expensive as taking his girlfriend to the cinema as it was, he 
couldn't buy even popcorn to enjoy the movie, so now he was starving. So he resolved he would take dinner 
first, and check-out his costume later. He went downstairs again, right onto the kitchen, and quickly fixed 
himself a couple of sandwiches and a diet coke. "Twerp, i want to watch some TV, move!" Damon said. "Hey, no 
fair! I'm bored!" Said Tim, but Damon wasn't listening "Not my problem twerp! I want to watch TV!". Damon 
advanced and switched off the video-game console "Oh please, let me play! we can play together, some co-
operative game, pleease?" Tim tried to convince his brother, but to no effort. "Ok twerp, this is the last 
time i warn you: Leave - me - alone!" Damon said, as he switched the channel to the sports channel. "Fine!" 
Tim said, going upstairs, and making as much noise as he could.
<BR><BR>
But then, Tim noticed his bigger brother room was unlocked. That was odd, because Damon had a strict policy 
against him entering the room without permission, mostly because Tim always made a mess when he entered. Just 
in order to piss his brother, he decided to, at least, scramble his clothes and then lock himself up in his 
room. As he entered, and turned on the light, he gazed upon all the stuff his brother had and he was forbidden 
to touch: basketball posters, an electric guitar, and a mysterious box on the bed... Maybe he was collecting 
stuff for the needy and putting them away at the box. So whatever.
<BR><BR>
He opened the closet, and found his brother's basketball jerseys. He took one of them: it was really large for 
him, noticing the difference of height between he an his brother. Then he got an idea: what if he put all of 
his brother's jerseys into his goodwill box? That would be enough for a revenge. So he took the jersey to the 
box, and opened it. But instead of goodwill stuff, he found the Bear costume. "What the hell is this?" Tim 
said, forgetting everything about his puny revenge, and taking the bear costume out.
Just like his brother before him, he became entranced with the costume. What was doing his brother with the 
costume, anyways? it looked like a perfect bear: Big, strong, tall, everything he always wanted to be. Without 
noticing, he started looking for a zipper in the back, when he suddenly found it and pull it down all the way 
over.
<BR><BR>
As he put one foot inside the costume, he felt something odd, like if the costume was actually adapting to 
him. "Wow, this thing has padding on it" Tim though. He slid his other foot and, in one movement, he slid both 
arms inside the bear massive arms, adjusting his chest to the bear's chest. The same thing happened, the 
costume adapted to his shape as if it actually had some sort of padding.At this point, he decided to look on 
his brother full length mirror, carrying the bear head on his right... 
hand? it was a claw now, a bear claw. But the reflection wasn't his: it was as if someone put his whole head 
over a big grizzly bear standing on it's hind legs. He looked even taller! Definitively, had to be padding. 
<BR><BR>
He looked onto the bear claws: both big, strong, and with very sharp claws at the end of each finger. 
Mesmerized, he opened and closed his hands inside, it felt so good... but the most  important part of all, the 
head, was still missing. In one singe movement, he put the head on, and fastened it onto the suit. the results 
were impressive: there was he, not a young human boy, but a big grizzly bear, standing on his hind legs. 
<BR><BR>
Then he got another idea: he grabbed on his brother jersey and slid it over the costume, and took some 
shorts and put them on, too. The results were immediate: as soon as he looked on the mirror, he gazed himself 
as if he were a mascot of some bear-themed college team. "Hahahaha this is awesome" Tim said, his voice 
muffled from inside the head. He started making some poses, looking at the huge muscles the bear had...
<BR><BR>
In that very moment he heard something from downstairs, Tim though it was his brother coming upstairs so he 
froze in place and got scared for a couple of seconds. Tim decided it was better to take off the costume, 
but... in that very moment, the costume's zipper disappeared, and the folds on the head melded with the rest 
of the costume. As he desperately tried to remove the head, Tim's hands started to feel heavy, as they become 
the new bear claws, the same thing happened to his foot. His tiny muscles were pushed by the bear's massive 
ones, as he felt himself becoming bigger and bigger by the second. Now he could feel the dense fur covering 
his own skin, he could even feel the jersey and the short through all the fur. The head fused with his head, 
his mouth pushed into the snout, his dull teeth being replaced with bear fangs. His mind was also being 
altered with bear thoughts... At the same time he looked at himself in the mirror, catching a glimpse of 
himself.... and then he realized something: if he was bigger, and taller, than his older brother, doesn't that 
made him the new "big brother"? Yeah, that was more like it, he was Damon's big bear brother...
<BR><BR>
As Tim's full transition into a bear finished, Damon opened the door....</p>
