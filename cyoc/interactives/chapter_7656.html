<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two years had paased and now Rachel's younger brother was eighteen years old. A youth full of vigor for life and still wishing to know the truth of the disappearance of his older sister.<br />
<br />
Stan Winslow enjoyed his dear sister as few brothers ever really do. The two of them were together all the time from his early years right up to the night before she left with Bill for their romp at Pleasure Island Amusement Park.<br />
<br />
Many a late night did Stan shed a tear for his dear Sister. Now he had a plan and with the aid of his best friend Frank Cottier they were planning a three day camping trip. <br />
<br />
Both Stan's parents and Frank's Father were thrilled with the two lads being so interested in hiking, and camping that little thought was given to possible alternate motives.<br />
<br />
As both young fella's were over the legal consenting age they would be able to enter the hollowed gates of Pleasure Island. At last their day came and Frank's car was packed solid with all the items anyone could ever need for camping. <br />
<br />
A waive good bye and the two whizzed off to find the deep dark truth of Rachel and her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you plan to check first Stan, that place is huge, must be over thirty square miles?&quot; asked Frank as he drove.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here!&quot; said Stan as he puled out a envelope filled with coupons.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one says when they entered, this one for the ferry ride over. A tag for some box lunch and a bottle of wine. I got this, it's for the Bacchannal of Pan exibit!&quot; said Stan.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, so is there any reason why we should check there?&quot; asked Frank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good reasoning question, ole' friend! Yes, this tag has the latest time printed on the backside of the card. This was the last place they went before something happened. The Park wrote a letter that both of them died in a boating accident. That was all Bull! Nothing, nothing at all shown here in Rachel's purse had anything remotely to do with boats, swimming or anything to do with water, she hated open water, she couldn't swim!&quot; said Stan ans Frank gave a knod of approval.<br />
<br />
A nine hour drive, a long stead drive at last brought them to the massive parking lot just East of the ferry landing. As the boys locked their things in the car a note was left just in case they failed to return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Stan what about all those wierd stories we heard about this place?' asked a nervous Frank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just hysteria, I bet!&quot; replied Stan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I don't know you remember Lyle from school and how he snuck into the Park. He tell's a story about being changed into an animal! I know it must be plum crazy but he tell's quite the story, lots of detail!&quot; replied Frank sound even more nervous as he and Stan watch a long parade of Donkeys being unloaded from the Ferry's freight hold.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll prove your just plain nuts!&quot; said Stan as the long line of Donkey's walked along tied nose to tail, their head hung low.<br />
<br />
&quot;ANY DONKEYS WANT TO BECOME HUMAN AGAIN?&quot; yelled Stan quite loud.<br />
<br />
As if he's just shot off a gun the entire line of Donkey's came to a stop. Almost every one of them turned their heads toward Stan and some began to bray wildly.<br />
<br />
Stan stood mute and wide eyed at the sight of so much racket. As he turned to head for the Ferry ticket office a wrangler came up close and confronted Stan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there Sonny, you like the queer Donkey stories about those who come to Pleasure Island? Well just come with me and I'll be more than happy to answer any of your questions. Oh but if you yell that fool question again and any of those nags break loose I'm sure you won't mind filling in for one of them, will ya Sonny?' grumbled a tired and dusty Donkey wrangler.<br />
<br />
Frank was ready now more than ever to head for home and safety.<br />
<br />
As the wrangler went back to the leading his catch and the parade of Donkey's began coming out of the Ferry hold, up the gangway, and past Stan, he had to say one more thing.<br />
<br />
In a quiet and soft voice he said, &quot;Any of you Donkey's wish you could fuck your way to freedom?&quot;<br />
<br />
A good twenty Donkey's turned their heads, twitched their ears and in a flash dropped their giant cocks to a state of full ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that tell you, Stan?&quot; asked Frank as Stan stood gawking at the line of willing Donkeys and more than ready swaying cocks.<br />
<br />
Stan was very quiet as the Ferry began churning it's way from the dock to the island landing. It was then that Frank wanted to go below and grab a hot dog or two. Stan waived him off as his belly felt rather sick of worry and not ready for food.<br />
<br />
Frank went down the main stairway and stopped at the swinging doors to a wild sounding salloon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come in, no cover charge here! Drinks are on the house today, come on in!&quot; said a pretty girl of slender form and the largest tits Frank had ever seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH, only want a hot dog!&quot; stated Frank as he stared at those huge tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like my breasts? I might let you pet them if I could pet you!&quot; she beconed the youth.<br />
<br />
Frank looked from side to side as other beauties' were propositioning others as theu too came in. Standing in awe of her he could not get out a word till she stepped very close and dug her cute hands down the front of Frank's pants.<br />
<br />
In less than a minute Frank found himself being lead down the hallway to her stateroom. It was at that moment Stan stood on the grand stairs and saw his silly friend enter the room. Thinking better than he did ashore, Stan made a beeline for the state room door.<br />
<br />
Opening the door very easy he peered inside. There stood Frank stripped naked and standing on some round peddestal. He was looking up at his hands tied with a rope and standing on his tiptoes. it had been maybe ten minutes for Stan to push through the crowds and open the door for Frank to be accosted and raped silly.<br />
<br />
Stan almost opened the door when from one side came the lady, now dressed in a long black gown.<br />
<br />
Stepping inside but hunching down he watched the fate of his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;You Frankie, you liked my big tits, didn't you little man?&quot; she chidded him as her right hand took a brush dipped in liquid and began to paint Frank's body.<br />
<br />
Frank could only moan his own fate as he stood there tied and hung.</p>
