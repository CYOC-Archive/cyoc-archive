<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan and Magnus hurried into Hall B, looking for room 135, bounding down the hallway as fast as their meaty legs would let them. They finally spotted the Computer Programming room and both of their heart’s sank when they noticed the door was closed. Dan reached for the doorknob and tried to turn it to no avail. They were late.<br />
<br />
Magnus let out an anguished whimper, the giant bear despairing at making his crush late for class. “Dan! I’m so, so sorry! I shouldn’t have taken you on such a long tour. Please…I can make it up to y-“ <br />
<br />
He was cut off by Dan, fervently shaking his head. “Magnus, its fine. It’s only the first day of class, I’m sure the professor will understand!”<br />
Magnus looked worried, like he had doomed them both to a fate worse than death. “B-but the punishment! I hear-“ Magnus stammered until he was cut off yet again, this time by the door opening. In the doorway stood a hefty man, middle aged with salt and pepper hair and a beard. He was gruff, yet astute, wearing bifocals and a sweater vest. His massive muscle belly and arms were barely concealed underneath his dress clothes and you could see a hefty bulge in his pleated khakis. Dan looked up at the bear’s face. What he thought would normally be kind, forgiving eyes where narrowed into a scowl at the two students.<br />
<br />
“It’s about time you two showed up! I’ll have you know that if you make a habit of this, I will dock you a letter grade for every class you arrive late to! Now get in, both of you.” He pointed into the classroom as Dan and Magnus slinked towards two empty desks, one behind the other. Magnus waited for Dan to choose a seat, his natural submissiveness causing him to waver. Dan took the back while Magnus took the front and Dan immediately regretted the decision as his view of the board was now blocked entirely by Magnus’ huge back.<br />
<br />
Dan looked around. Six other young bears were seated in the classroom, but due to the size of everyone in this new world it looked quite full. Dan spied two glancing at him and then each other, obviously snickering to themselves about the latecomers.<br />
<br />
“Now,” started the professor, catching Dan’s attention, “As I was saying before these two joined us, my name is Professor Pascal. I will be teaching the Computer Programming 101 class. We were just going over the syllabus when we were interrupted. I believe we just went over the section about tardiness. Can anyone tell me what we can expect from tardy students?”<br />
<br />
Before any of the other students could raise their hands, Magnus raised his arm high. Professor Pascal looked at the brute and smirked.  “Oh, Magnus, have you an answer for me? I’m impressed since you weren’t here when we went over this!”<br />
<br />
From behind, Dan could see Magnus’ neck turn bright red. “Tardy students are…well…they’re punished.” The last word barely squeaked out of Magnus’ mouth, his body trembling. Magnus mentioned punishment just before they were let in class. Was this really something the professors here did? And what kind of punishment was it?<br />
<br />
Professor Pascal smiled back and nodded, cupping his hands together. “I see my reputation for punishment has preceded me for another semester! Well, since you answered I’m sure you’ll want to get it over with! Come up here Magnus.”<br />
<br />
Dan watched Magnus struggle to get out of his seat, his huge muscles catching on the desk. He wiggled his way to the front of the room, a good foot taller than the professor. He turned around and faced the class with an incredibly anxious look.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, Sir? I was w-wondering…” Magnus stammered.<br />
<br />
“C’mon boy, let’s hear it,” said Pascal in an irritated tone.<br />
<br />
Magnus flushed some more. “I was wondering if you would let me take Dan’s punishment too! I was the reason he was late, and I think it’d be unfair for him to well…take this punishment.” Magnus was sweating now as he glanced at Dan. He sure was a gentleman, offering to take Dan’s place in dealing with whatever this punishment business was. Dan smiled at him and felt his pocket for his phone. Perhaps he could aid Magnus with whatever the professor was going to do with him.<br />
<br />
“Now, I don’t normally make exceptions, but since it is the first day and you so want to take his place, then I will allow it. Do know that you will be getting twice the punishment, young man! I’ll be right back. Strip while I’m gone.”<br />
<br />
The words took Dan by surprise. The professor was having Magnus strip? The thought made Dan’s cock twitch with pleasure. He knew for sure he could use this situation to his advantage. While the professor was in the back room, Dan dug his phone out and opened the Chronovac app. He loaded Magnus’ profile, the stark-naked figure on his phone matching the unclothed bear standing at the front of the room. He could see poor Magnus shaking in fear…time to do something about that confidence.<br />
<br />
Pascal reentered the room, carrying a large wooden paddle with holes in it and what appeared to be a 10” flared butt plug and lube. He set them down on his desk and rolled up his sleeves, eyeing Magnus in the buff.<br />
<br />
Magnus was a brute of a man, standing over 7 feet tall and covered with silver blond body hair. His long hair, normally pulled into a tight braid, was in a loose ponytail hanging down his massive back. His barrel chest, muscled gut, and ballooned quads made his endowed package look tiny by comparison. Three feet long and more than a foot thick, it pointed straight out in a semi-hard erection, no doubt at half mast because of his nerves. The poor guy was frightened beyond belief. <br />
<br />
Dan looked down at his phone and adjusted Magnus’ confidence slider by a few increments. He hoped it was enough for Magnus to calm down, but he snickered to himself knowing he liked seeing the brute nervously present himself in front of the class. Dan didn’t press enter just yet. He wanted to see what this punishment was all about.<br />
<br />
“Alright Magnus, for your punishment I have a few things for you here. First this plug is going into your rump. You are to wear it for the rest of the day. You may bring it back to me, washed, next class. I will also be giving you 20 spankings with this board while that plug is in. I hope this will teach you a lesson for being late.”<br />
<br />
Pascal lubed up the plug with one hand and then stuck a meaty finger into Magnus’ hole. Magnus gulped and moaned as the professor fingered him, lubing him up from the inside. The older man lined up the plug and started to shove it into Magnus who was already grunting quite loudly. The brute had to lean over on the desk for Pascal to get the plug in.<br />
<br />
“Quiet down Magnus, you sound like this is the first time you’ve taken something in that muscled ass of yours!” The oblivious professor continued working on the plug, getting about halfway in on the first push, while Magnus blushed and moaned as his virgin hole was probed by the rubber plug. Dan confirmed his suspicions on Magnus’ Chronovac bio: He was a virgin. Hadn’t even played with his hole once! Dan pressed enter on the Chronovac and reality rippled as Magnus grew a little more confident. His stress eased up and the plug slipped right in. Though he was still nervous, his cock had erected to its full length and was dripping large globs of pre. <br />
<br />
Pascal patted Magnus on his ass and grabbed the paddle, giving a few practice swings. Dan turned to the Chronovac again and entered a custom task. He would make it so Magnus grew for every slap on his ass. He left the size limit unchecked and pressed enter. As soon as he did, the first slap of the board hit Magnus’ rear end.<br />
<br />
The brute winced in pain as the slap jiggled his thighs and glutes, cheeks already beet red. As the shock wave traveled, Magnus started to expand outward, becoming wider than before. His lats and quads ballooned out a couple inches and his pecs inflated, creating deep cleavage between the two slabs of meat. The second whack echoed throughout the room. Dan looked around and the other students were snickering and even recording the punishment on their phones. Two students in the back were jerking each other off watching the punishment happen.<br />
<br />
Dan heard another whack and watched Magnus’s three-foot cock grow another four inches and his balls inflate to basketball size. It seemed the Chronovac randomly assigned a few body parts to grow with each hit. How freaky was Magnus gonna look at the end of this? Dan shoved the phone back in his pocket and continued to watch.<br />
<br />
By the tenth slap Magnus had tears in his eyes, completely embarrassed and distressed that he was only halfway done with his punishment. Each paddling hurt so bad, but also felt good, pushing the plug deep into his hole like he was getting fucked. The giant’s cock was leaking steadily like a faucet at this point, close to cumming. The only thing keeping his seed from spewing everywhere was the stinging sensation of the paddle ever few seconds.<br />
<br />
The eleventh and twelfth smacks echoed throughout the room and Magnus cried out, a deep moan of pleasure and pain. Unknown to him, his body surged with growth, getting taller now, closing in on 8 feet. His cock and balls had also grown about a foot in length and diameter respectively and his muscle gut was becoming rounder and rounder, like a man on steroids. Hair sprouted further down his chest and back, looking slightly darker just because of the new forest that sprouted from his growing body.<br />
<br />
Dan rubbed his cock through his cargo shorts and jock, squeezing and groping it as he watched the submissive beast take a beating. By the nineteenth smack Magnus was 8 and a half feet tall, had gained 160 pounds of muscle, and become incredibly hirsute. This all seemed normal to everyone but Dan though; Magnus had always been a hairy monster of a man, rivaling the smallest gingers in size and strength and submissiveness, just not in spirit. <br />
Magnus came on the twentieth stroke, as if on cue. Vast amounts of hot cum shot from the giant’s cock and onto the <br />
side of Pascal’s desk, dripping down like wet paint onto the floor. A full minute went by until his cock ran dry, Magnus heaving on his hands and knees. Moans filled the room as the other students came, Dan grunting too as he made a mess in his jock. <br />
Pascal instructed Magnus to clean up and to remain naked for the rest of class to fulfill the rest of his punishment. The shy boy huffed and puffed, quietly mopping up his mess and sitting down back in front of Dan when he was done. The smell of sweat and sex wafted over Dan as the brute carefully lowered himself into the seat, rump stinging from twenty hard paddles.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Magnus, Dan put a hand on his back for reassurance. The big guy went rigid, startled, and doubled over on his desk, cumming again for another thirty seconds. The big guy got up afterwards to clean up his new mess.<br />
<br />
Dan thought to himself about making Magnus less sensitive to interaction but then disregarded the thought. As uncomfortable as it made Magnus, Dan was growing to like the shy brute, and his infatuation with Dan made it all the more pleasurable to tease him with.<br />
Perhaps he’d make Magnus late for class again one of these days.</p>
