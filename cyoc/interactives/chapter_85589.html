<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay sat down on the bed and began to undress. He smiled as he thought back to the dinner with his parents; he introduced his fiancée Shannon to them. The dinner went great everybody got along and his parents liked Shannon, not that that was hard she was funny and everyone like her. He pulled off his underwear and walked naked into the bathroom to start the shower. He hoped that she would join him but she was downstairs getting some one-on-one time with the parents. Once the shower was warmed up he stepped in and started to get soaped up. He heard his fiancé come in to the room and shouted out &quot;Come in and join me, hon.&quot; and then heard her moving around. The shower door opened and a big foot sneaked in. One thing about Shannon was that she had big feet for a girl but Jay thought it was kind of hot anyway. The rest of her followed the foot and they shared a hug and a kiss. Jay felt himself grow and briefly considered some hot shower sex but decided to leave it for later. He began to wash her back as she got her shoulder length blonde hair wet.<br />
&quot;I liked your parents; they are really reserved it&#39;s a nice change from my family&quot;<br />
&quot;They liked you too, I could tell. The next step is your parents.&quot; He kissed her neck and ran his hands down her body and began to consider changing his mind about the shower sex.<br />
She sighed &quot;About that...&quot;<br />
Jay felt a bucket of cold water thrown on him &#39;Crap this can&#39;t be good&#39; he thought<br />
&quot;There are some things I need to tell you about my family. They are a bunch of clowns.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ok, that’s why I like you. You&#39;re funny, beautiful, smart and I love you and nothing will change that.&quot;<br />
She turned and looked at him seriously &quot;You will have to convert&quot;<br />
Jay laughed &quot;Religions, sure that is ok. We are not very religious in my family&quot;<br />
Shannon looked a little worried &quot;No, not exactly.&quot;<br />
The pause built between the two as Jay waited looking confused as Shannon looked flustered. Finally Jay broke the tension &quot;Look, I love you and whatever it is I will do it to marry you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Close your eyes&quot; she covered his eyes forcing them close. &quot;There is one thing I haven&#39;t told you about me and I am afraid too.&quot;<br />
Confused and with his eyes closed Jay reached out and held Shannon &quot;Whatever it is, I love you.&quot; honestly feeling a bit scared at what this &#39;thing&#39; might be Jay felt Shannon step back.<br />
&quot;Ok, open your eyes&quot; her voice sounded higher and different. Slowly Jay opened his eyes and jumped back hitting the shower wall. Shannon now had shoulder length yellow hair, her skin was chalk white all of her skin down to her now very large feet, she had light purple eye shadow filling the space upwards to high arching drawn on black eyebrows, long sparkling eye lashes, bright red lips forming a smile that never left her face, light pink circles on her cheeks and a round red ball on her nose. <br />
&quot;What the hell, what happened? You look like a clown.&quot; Jay exclaimed. He didn’t hate clowns but they weren’t his favorite thing.<br />
&quot;Shhh...&quot; she put a white finger on his lips to quiet him &quot;Your parents will hear&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care, what is going on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I was born a clown. I can change my appearance for a while to look like a normal human but this is what I really look like.&quot;<br />
Jay&#39;s mind spun with that sentence.<br />
&quot;Sooo, you’re a clown?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
&quot;You were born a clown?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
&quot;Clowns have clown babies?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
&quot;And you can look normal&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;Yes, for a while&quot;<br />
&quot;So when you said your family was a bunch of clowns you meant they actually are a bunch of clowns?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
&quot;I must be having a nightmare.&quot; Jay said trying to convince himself.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok. I am still the funny Shannon you know and love, this is just how I truly look.&quot; Shannon pleaded<br />
&quot;Why would you do this to me?&quot; Jay blurted out as he slowly moved towards the door.<br />
&quot;I am a bit of a rebel in my family and I was just exploring when I met you and well, I fell in love with you.&quot; She took his hand in her snow white ones and held it silently pleading with her.<br />
Jay&#39;s mind raced with this bizarre turn of events, trying to think of a way out &quot;Ok, so now what?&quot; he said just talking to fill the silence.<br />
&quot;Well, your parents loved me and I hope you still love me and you can come meet my family.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yea, alright&quot; Jay said hoping this would end the conversation and he could get out of here away from her. He started to move to the shower door.<br />
&quot;And, well, you will have to convert.&quot; Jay froze with his hand on the door and turned back to her.<br />
&quot;Convert?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
&quot;Convert to what?&quot; Jay asked the question anyway but the chilling answer he knew already in the back of his mind and it sent chills down his spine.<br />
&quot;Convert to a clown.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean dress up like one with the makeup and wig?&quot; the feeling settled in his stomach almost making him puke.<br />
&quot;No, turn into a clown for real. It&#39;s wonderful you&#39;ll love it and being silly everyone will like you and you can do amazing things. But you can change to look like your old self for a short time too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you crazy, NO.&quot; Jay just looked at her as her a sadness fell over her face, or as close as you can get to as always smiling happy looking clown.<br />
&quot;But I thought you loved me?&quot; She embraced him and held him tight.<br />
&quot;Not now that you’re a fucking clown.&quot; Jay tried to break the hug but couldn&#39;t.<br />
She turned her head and gave him a long deep kiss that caused his eyes to go cross and his mind fog over.<br />
&quot;You want to be a clown.&quot; That sentence echoed in his head and he found himself repeating it &quot;I want to be a clown&quot; No, he did not want to be, he struggled but found he could not move or talk.<br />
&quot;You will enjoy being a clown&quot; Again he felt himself repeating the words &quot;I will enjoy being a clown.&quot; He struggled and fought to break out of the trance he was in but soon found those two sentences repeating over and over in his head growing stronger and louder. She ran her hands over his body moving her head lower to his nipples, sucking and biting them till they were red and erect. Jay felt himself grow under her ministrations as she moved lower kneeling before him and reaching for his now fully erect dick. She played with it with her fingers before leaning forward and licking it base to tip. Jay felt himself say &quot;I want to be a clown.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you will be a clown sweetie.&quot; Shannon responded before taking his whole dick in her mouth. She sucked hard and pulled it out of her mouth her tongue stimulating it on the way out and Jay felt his mind explode with the pleasure. Tingles started to emanate from his crotch running over his entire body, he reached out and braced himself on the wall. &quot;I will enjoy being a clown.&quot; The two commands were now freely bouncing around his mind as it was taken over by the pleasure of the epic blow job he was now getting. She went down again on his dick before sucking hard and removing it again developing a rhythm. Jango looked down at his arms like they were someone else’s, the hair on them was retreating and the skin was growing lighter with every suck of her blowjob. It was if all the color and human was being sucked out of him. The tingles were building through his body as he felt himself slip further and further away. Blue hair fell down into his line of vision as his hair grew and changed. He smiled as the pleasure built to a new level of bliss that he had never reached before and kept climbing, and the smile would never leave his face again as his lips turned a bright shade of red. His eyebrows disappeared and were replaced by thick drawn on ones higher on his forehead. A green triangle formed below his eyes. He looked down and saw her bobbing up and down on his dick that was now snow white surrounded by a bush of blue hair. His feet shot out tripling in size. She stopped and pulled his dick out from her mouth and he saw that the head of his dick was now a neon green ball; she probed the head for his precum trying to get as much as possible. She resumed her rhythm as spots began to form in front of his eyes, matching gaps forming in his mind. He gripped the wall harder as he felt himself tense and begin to go over the edge. His vision went white momentarily as he orgasmed, shooting pulse after pulse of cum into her mouth. He heard a pop and a neon green color now was at the bottom of his vision as his nose now was a green ball. New knowledge of clowning, slap stick, skits, juggling, face painting and how to change into a human filled his head. <br />
&quot;I am a clown. I like being a clown.&quot; He had always liked clowns that is why he fell in love with Skeeter and was thrilled to learn she really was a clown. When she asked him to convert to a clown he was more than willing and it felt great. He laughed and giggled feeling silly as tingles ran over his body. He pulled her up into a great kiss their nose rubbing sending shivers of pleasure through them.<br />
&quot;Thanks hon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you for loving me and deciding to convert. My parents will love you.&quot;<br />
They got out of the shower and dried off, Jango stopping to stare at his new reflection. He felt a strong surge of tingles and pleasure run through his body and thought back.<br />
&quot;Tomorrow is your parents but we have tonight.&quot; He pulled her naked form in to the bed and began to kiss her before a night of clown sex to themselves.</p>
