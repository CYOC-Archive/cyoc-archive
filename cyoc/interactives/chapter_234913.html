<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan continued the daily pill regiment. To his relief his testicals did not continue growing in size now that they were the size of small cantaloupes, however his body started to change in much more drastic ways. The intense sexdrive continued which meant Andrew had to put down some ground rules. One being: no more cumming inside him. His belly was getting quite noticeable in size, if he was a woman most would have assumed he was pregnant. Instead his work colleagues must just think the poor guy put on the pounds fairly quickly all around his stomach.<br />
<br />
A few days in, Andrew noticed small lumps growing above Dan’s hips. Worried they might be tumors, they emailed the medical facility which gave assurances that these symptoms were perfectly normal and safe before reminding them to stick to the daily dosage. Two days later he had grown taller and his lumps had developed into small prehensile arms and pectoral muscles just below Dan’s abs.<br />
<br />
“I’m not taking these things anymore, I’m becoming some sort of multi limbed freak!” Dan said crossing his arms, the now child arm sized limbs mirroring the gesture almost instantly after. “You were right. Obviously I should have never started taking pills without knowing what they did. I can’t keep developing random body parts!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, I don&#39;t know if that is wise at this point, see here it states &#39;any responsibility to reverse all unwanted effects caused by the trial will be voided if the subject fails to complete the trial. However, trails may be authorized to end prematurely during the scheduled monthly reviews at the doctor&#39;s discretion.&#39; Jesus Dan, did you not read any of this? There is a lot in here that seems very dodgy.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Dan said sheepishly. &quot;I just thought it was all typical terms and conditions lawyer-talk stuff like computer updates. I just knew I was going to be paid a lot for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well it means you have to take these pills until your first review, and hope that no more major changes happen, and all of this is reversible.&quot; Andrew explained.<br />
<br />
Dan conceded and continued to take the pills. As the weeks passed, Dan’s new arms grew to the same size as his originals, his body grew slowly in height to compensate. At first he hid his large balls and extra arms under baggy clothes, but once he was too tall for his t-shirts to cover his second pair of arms he stopped bothering, living naked at home 24/7, wanking, eating and playing video games. Often all at the same time since he had a second pair of hands to work with. Andrew secretly loved the changes. The second pack of abs developing under his toned (nippleless) bottom pecs were hot, and the extra arms during sex was extremely useful at getting Andrew to climax. Dan seemed to adapt well to the drastic changes. Instead of being ashamed and worried about his “freakish body” as he was either, Dan started to embrace his new multi-limbed form. Andrew suspected the intense hornyness from his massive balls might be clouding his mind, but there wasn’t anything either could do until the end of the first trial month, so might as well enjoy his enhanced form for now.<br />
<br />
Three weeks into the trial, Dan found his upper torso was getting top heavy and off balance for him to walk upright, so instead he started using his second pair of arms as front legs whenever he needed to walk around. Essentially crawling to start off with, slowly his arms, legs and spine seemed to adapt to the new position helping him walk like other quadrupedal animals.<br />
<br />
His front “legs&#39;&#39; over Andrew’s shoulders as he lay half off the bed, Dan mounted his boyfriend like a horse. Dan’s giant balls swing around and slapping the back of his hind legs from the momentum of his thrusts. There was the weight of one and a half men pressing down on Andrew as he moaned in pleasure. They continued making love horsey style until Dan was on the verge of cumming. <br />
“I’m gonna..., I’m gonna...!” Dan grunted and sped up his thrusts.<br />
Andrew squirmed, “Fuck yes! But… pull… out.., I just got my... abs back from... the last load…”<br />
Too late, Dan groaned and thrust deep as he unleashed his full load deep inside this lover, pumping five times. Andrew moaned in frustrated pleasure as his abs quickly expanded once again from the gallon of seed now injected inside him.<br />
<br />
The two flop ungracefully onto the bed together, Andrew wrapped in two sets of Dan’s limbs in a naked embrace. Dan quickly finishes his boyfriend off by giving him a hand/foot job. They cuddled naked and drenched in sweat as the post-sex estacy wore off. Andrew’s smiling face pressed up against Dan’s firm chest. Dan caressing Andrew’s nipples before moving down to his expanded belly. After a few rubs Andrew perked up with a playful push.<br />
“You were supposed to pull out! Now I’m going to work with a full belly again!”<br />
“Sorry babes I just couldn’t stop before it happened.”<br />
“Well ‘boytaur’ guess you’ll just have to carry me to the shower then.” Andrew smirked and lifted himself up. <br />
Dan bashfully relented standing up on all fours (the lower four) and letting Andrew climb onto his lower back. Belly squished against Dan’s upper back and arms around his chest, Andrew ‘rode’ his boyfriend to the bathroom. <br />
“I can definitely get used to this, my very own ‘boytaur’ boyfriend,” He said, kissing Dan on the cheek. After a quick google search the two had discovered Dan was some kind of boytaur as the internet calls them, fictional photomorphs of people to look similar to centaurs, but instead of horses, their lower bodies were still human forms. After that, Andrew often called Dan “his boytaur” as an affectionate pet name. Reaching the bathroom, Dan knelt down to let Andrew slide off and enter the shower to get ready for work. <br />
<br />
After Andrew left, Dan also had a shower. He had to squeeze a bit as the shower wasn’t made for people with multiple sets of legs. After he was dry, a still naked Dan sat down in front of the TV for another game session. He had leant to have his lower body sit like a sphinx for the most comfort. Balls laid out behind his ass on the carpet. <br />
<br />
*Only one more week until the first monthly report.* He thought to himself as the XBox booted up. While it was nice to be paid to especially do nothing but fuck and play games, he was getting a bit stir crazy not getting to go anywhere anymore. He couldn’t let anyone see him like this, let alone find any clothes that would fully fit even if he did want to journey outside. His friends were wondering why he hadn’t hung out for ages and it was hard to make excuses. *Hopefully they can do something about this. Reverse these effects.*</p>
