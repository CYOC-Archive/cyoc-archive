<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In all the past years George had in the back of his mind a wild hope. A hope and for his own pleasures came the plan to use his scientific learning to advance his sex life.<br />
<br />
Test subjects #1. and 2. were his primary object of desire. As the anti-cell inhibitors worked on the infected cells his positive cell growth serum worked repairing and then strengthening the entine animal from bone to mucsle.<br />
<br />
In just two weeks the cow was completely healed and ready to be returned to the farm. A close check of her milk production and twice daily sample were taken to be examined for any abnormatity.<br />
<br />
The Bull was healing just fine and as the testing continued George removed samples of thyroid enzyme which he found to his delight had changed. Now the bull's thyroid was sending out a radical enzyme. The properties of the enzyme looked very favorable to George's plans.<br />
<br />
Late one evening after the Lab's staff had all gone home George sat looking at two bottles of refined serum. One of the bottles was his new cell growth enhancer, while the other was the radical thyroid formula he had privately brewed into a serum to advance his personal pleasures.<br />
<br />
George dropped his trousers and prepared a condom for use. He opened the package and then taking a cotton swab smeared the interior of the condom with the radical Thyroid formula. Taking a deep breath George then pulled the condom over his maleness. His plan was for the formula to be emulsified into the bloodstream without passing through the expected changes of Liver or the digestive process.<br />
<br />
Then came the Cellular Growth Enhancement serum which was injected directly into the blood stream. Sitting down he looked at his male self and healthy legs thinking he was in fine physical shape for what might come along.<br />
<br />
George went home his wife had a nice supper waiting for the families only provider. After eating George relaxed and then retired to bed early since the next morning he would rise early and drive over to the Body-B-Builder health club for his twice a week workout.<br />
<br />
Come morning George was awaken by his frantic wife. As he opened his eyes her face and those of their two sons were looking at his with real concern on each face. It seemed he was sleeping so soundly that for more than an hour none of them could wake George out of his sleep.<br />
<br />
Groggy, George sat up on the side of his bed and offered a small smile of love for their concerns. The boys all headed off for school while even over breakfast the Misses looked at her husband with deep starring concern.<br />
<br />
A while later found George warming up in the Body-B-Builder's gym. As usual the Trainer came around with his offering of a small milkshake to aide in the workouts. George always loved those rich milkshakes they made him feel extra good and working out always went well.<br />
<br />
The daily grind went on for the next week and a half till one morning George woke up from his sounder than sound night's sleep to a numb feeling about his thighs.<br />
<br />
As George showered that morning he sat on the small seat letting the steaming hot water run down over his back. He felt very sick to his stomach while also feeling aches and pains in the lower back.<br />
<br />
The aches remained with him even during that morning's workout and when he'd showered again and was holding his back as if in pain the Trainer took notice.<br />
<br />
Before George could leave for work the Trainer offered George a tab having four pills covered in a plastic bubble. He suggested George take the pills and let them work out his pains. George was assured the pills were quite legal and the Trainer had only George's best interest in heart. <br />
<br />
On the drive to the Lab George popped one of the pills swallowing it down dry as he always could with pills. It was when he'd swallowed the third pill his pain subsided.<br />
<br />
Later that morning as George was working on test case # 5. Leslie came up to him with something in her hand. As George looked down he saw the pain tablet still wrapped in its plastic bubble. He began to explain what it was when Leslie cut him off short.<br />
<br />
Leslie explained her knowledge of the unmarked pills setting on a red card and covered in a plastic seal. &quot;Anabolic Steroids!&quot; Screamed George as he clenched his gut and ran for the lab.<br />
 <br />
Leslie followed George and once in his private office she slammed the door shut demanding what he was up to! Seems in her inventory she had recorded the absence of one bottle of the Cell Enhancement Serum.<br />
<br />
George at first was not willing devulge the fool plan for his increased sexaul pleasures. Once he had though to his surprise Leslie agreed to help with the proviso that if it worked she would be the one person to market the process.<br />
<br />
George could do little but agree as he was over a barrel. If the managers above him in the company found out his plan his scientific career was quickly over.<br />
<br />
Leslie began by giving George a physical exam measuring his body parts in sizes and lengths. It was when she took a blood sample and placed it into her microscopes she found new troubles for George.</p>
