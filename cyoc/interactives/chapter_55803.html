<br />
With just a handful of gestures, Glass Marie was able to make it so none of the Pride or <br />
Pack would wonder where five of their cubs and three of their adults were. They were not <br />
'forgotten' per-say, they simply now existed out of context. This would insure the story <br />
could be completed without further complication, additions, or interruptions.  With a <br />
handful of other gestures, her audience stopped wondering about their Packmates <br />
wondering where they were, or thinking about how they weren't tired or hungry in spite of <br />
the story now running well over twenty-four hours. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie must have been relieved to finally being sailing underway,&quot; Abbey said.<br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;She thought of it almost as 'too little too soon' by now it was already <br />
November. And Marie knew that the witches had to fall before the end of next year or ... <br />
she didn't know what precisely, it was like cause and effect itself went mad after that <br />
fateful time in her vision almost surrounding the witches. And that 'hole' was getting <br />
bigger the longer they took.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what WERE the wicked witches ultimately planning?&quot; Maddex asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;As said before, the mad children were only stage one. After the disaster with the giant <br />
rune the witches chose another method. Every mad child would in fact become effectively <br />
their familiars, channeling all that power through them and each other almost in a <br />
feedback loop. They would then be able to warp all of Glendale into whatever shape they <br />
wanted. And after Glendale was 'devoured' everyone becoming a part of their magic, a <br />
cascade effect to turn all of the colony, then all of the east coast, then the continent, then <br />
the landmass, then the world into the ideal world that now was justified as themselves <br />
creating it for their Joella. <br />
<br />
&quot;The witches would get the ball rolling on this scheme 1689 New Years Day, and it would <br />
have reached the point it would have been impossible for ANYONE ANYWHERE to stop on <br />
New Years Eve that same year. However, it wasn't a simple black and white, 'everything <br />
okay, to everything a twisted wonderland of illogic and chaos.'  This would be gradual. <br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons that Gomorrah didn't replace Solome/Lucky. She had no need to <br />
as the mad children began to act as her medium to channel the infinite Chaos. While the <br />
first recorded orphanage in the colonies wasn't until decades later, the witches by the end <br />
of January had established what could for all appearance appear to be one. As an adult <br />
woman, Joella would become the owner and manager of the place (barely tolerated since <br />
motherhood -was- a woman's job after all).  The witches of course by this began to realize <br />
how many people were leaving Glendale to escape the 'Wandering Demons.' But they <br />
needed the population big enough for their scheme to work. This meant anyone who <br />
happened to be just traveling through Glendale had a chance of being turned into a little <br />
boy or girl depending on the witches' whims and taken in to their 'orphanage'; or the <br />
'lucky' ones who were in groups were turned into families whose one thought was settling <br />
in Glendale. Few walked into Glendale walked out that year.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally this GREATLY aggravated the puritans seeing those who weren't part of their <br />
faith settling down in a town that had been means to be THEIR home and THEIR bastion to <br />
their beliefs and faith. But the witches were able to keep their unwitting stock protected. <br />
Yes, -protected- them. Like a farmer saves the pig he's going to slaughter in the morning <br />
from wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />

1688 November <br />
<br />
Father Draco out of curiosity had to ask, &quot;So have you thought of a new name yet? As I <br />
recall, Gargoyles always call themselves what they are assigned to guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lion/dragon gargoyle said, &quot;You recall correctly. Technically right now my name would <br />
be Marie, but I sense she would not approve of such things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You care weather she approves or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather not add to her stresses. And once your farce of a mission begins in the New <br />
World, I'll have to take a new name anyway to accommodate the place I will be protecting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Draco  didn't like his mission being called a 'farce' but held his tongue, knowing this <br />
mission wouldn't even exist if Marie Cruz did not need to hunt down and assassinate a <br />
coven of witches who only Marie had any poof of existing and that was through DREAMS. <br />
<br />
Adam in spite of being the youngest was also the most curious if not the one who spoke <br />
the most (that honor belonged to Joshua). He had managed to get onto Captain Wesley's <br />
ship -twice- touching everything he laid his hands on not making nearly enough noise to <br />
be noticed by sailors intent on their task. It helped that Adam was smaller than a human <br />
child would be his own age. <br />
<br />
When Lucky Star saw her youngest was not with her kitten playing with the Grotesque, he <br />
called out to him. He finally broke his silence and called out to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get him.&quot; Said Rachel, and the pregnant passionate red felman then proceeded to leap, <br />
swing, and in all of thirty seconds retrieve the wandering child who was stunned and <br />
excited by Rachel's acrobatics.  The children also noticed and many people saw this was <br />
were momentary stunned by this woman's sudden unrehearsed act of agility. <br />
<br />
Marie was also startled. That woman had experience. Marie's own curiosity was perked. <br />
<br />
Lilly asked, &quot;Was she from the circus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glass Marie shook her head, &quot;The incarnation of the circus as you know it with acrobats <br />
wouldn't exist for over fifty years but nice guess though. Naturally, Marie Cruz had to ask <br />
Rachel about her talents. Rachel insisted they, and her family and Marie's friends discuss <br />
somewhere where they could sit down.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;--so after I was captain of the pirate ship  Br&uuml;nnhilde for a year and a half I retired from <br />
raiding spanish ships--&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;--the human introduced himself as Baron named M&uuml;nchhausen and said he had come <br />
from the future--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--and after the baron brokered peace between the lupman and leoman leaders by <br />
defeating the two of them in a wresting match at the same time--&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;--so I had to decline when the baron took his trip to the moon--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I did destroy it. The world isn't ready for The Philopher's Stone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;--And after I was the twenty-first wife of the Shiek for three days before he was run over <br />
by an rampaging elephant--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--And so I had to sadly decline the African savages' request to become their new queen, <br />
but I did appoint the man who had helped me fend off the rival tribe and their slaver allies <br />
as their new king--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--the Dalai Lama thanked me for my advice on the subject--&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;--So for saving him from the ninja assassin the emperor of Japan chose graciously NOT <br />
to have me executed for trespassing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--people couldn't help but stare as I rode Horde Queen Tiamat XXXVII on her back <br />
straight through the front gates--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--I still have the scars under my hair from nearly being scalped by some angry natives--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that was where I met Dillon, but actually as it turned out we had met three times <br />
before, twice as children and a chance meeting a year before that, but that was the <br />
meeting that actually mattered because--&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As it turned out he had chased me all the way across two oceans...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So no one knew I had stopped the alchemist's scheme to turn all felman in the world <br />
beige. A couple months later was when Dillion finally proposed after I helped settle <br />
Merlin's ghost to rest.&quot; <br />
<br />
Maddex's two head said together, &quot;So ... how much of what she said was true, how much of <br />
that was exaggeration, and how much was DIME-STORE BALONEY?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Glass Marie looked at a total loss herself, &quot;Even -I- don't know!&quot;</p>
