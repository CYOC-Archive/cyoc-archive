<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The island was a series of salt flats, perfect sandy white beaches with some rocky beaches around the base of the large mountain in the heart. The trees seamed to be the standard palm trees one would see at almost any island, however as Sam and Taylor journeyed deeper into the island more and more strange plants jumped out to Taylor.<br />
<br />
“Another one?” said Taylor as Sam turned to look at his girlfriend as she studied a flower. “This is a plant is native to south east Asia not the Caribbean.”<br />
<br />
“An invasive species maybe?” offered Sam, Taylor was the one with a green thumb and went to college to study plants not him but right now he didn’t care about some damn flower mysteries like that could wait. First, they need to find fresh water, there had to be some on this island there was a large amount of birds in the trees.<br />
<br />
“Possibly but there is plants from around the world here…it is so strange.” Said Taylor as she adjusted her backpack, only to scream. That scream caused Sam to turn around just in time to see that a small monkey had landed on his girlfriend’s backpack. The monkey grabbed the baseball cap from her head, and jumped off before darting away into the undergrowth. <br />
<br />
Sam couldn’t help it, he laughed a bit as Taylor glared at him with all the anger she could in her blue eyes some of her long blonde hair coming undone from her pony tail from the monkey ripping off the hat.<br />
<br />
“Sorry I couldn’t help it.” Said Sam as Taylor crossed her arms and rolled her eyes, they were alone and Sam could drop his distant cold and hard personal with her. He had grown up in a strict household which prized success and not emotion, if you weren’t 1st place then you were a failure in his family, his family had a lot of money because of it and it was his families yacht which currently sat dead a mile or two away but lacked any warmth between family members. Taylor had helped him come out of that shell, but he still put it up among others but alone he could smile and act warm with her. <br />
<br />
“I forgive you, now come on lets try to find my hat.” Said Taylor as they kept going, they didn’t have to go far the monkey was sitting on a rock beside a small lake, near the base of the mountain which dominated the whole island. The lake lead into a cave which went deeper into the mountain, as they neared the monkey noticed them and tossed the hat into the water before running to the nearest tree<br />
<br />
“Son of a bitch.” Cursed Taylor as they came to the edge of the crystal-clear water. Her hat had to be a good 10 yards out and was drifting ever so slowly away. <br />
<br />
“Want me to get it?” inquired Sam<br />
<br />
“Na…I’ll get it, I could use a swim.” Stated Taylor as she kicked off her shoes and pulled down her cargo shorts to show her light sky blue bikini bottom. Sam couldn’t help but smile as he watched her undress and Taylor would admit to herself she did undress a little bit more slowly and provocatively because of it. In the end she was standing there in her light sky blue bikini, her blonde hair pulled back in a pony tail, she was breathtaking beautiful to Sam and he thanked God that she loved him. By the time that was done her hat was nearly 20 yards out. <br />
<br />
She waded into the water, pausing for a moment it was slightly warmer than she expected as she headed out. About 10 feet from the shore the sandy bottom gave way to a drop and she dove under the water and swam the rest of the way to get to her hat, she opened her eyes a bit under the water feeling the sting of salt water in her eyes but the water was so crystal-clear she could see that the bottom which had to be a good 50ft down was covered with sand as well. She reached her hat and lifted it up into the air.<br />
<br />
“Good job.” said Sam from the shore<br />
<br />
“Care to join me in a swim?” inquired Taylor as Sam smiled and kicked off his shoes and pulled down his cargo shorts to show he too had worn his swim trunks just in case he had to get in the water. His was jet black like his hair but with a thick red stripe down the sides. He pulled off his shirt to show his perfectly muscled chest as he put his shirt aside and entered the water. <br />
<br />
A few powerful strokes later he was at her side and pulled her into an embrace as they swam in the pool. <br />
<br />
Neither of them notices the movement at the bottom of the pool as multiple things began to move, drawn out of their slumber by the movement in their pool. They where covered with sand which fell away, and they were white anyhow and blended in with the bottom. They where blind but they sensed the movement in the water above them, there where dozens of them as they began to circle the couple swimming unaware of what was about to happen to them. <br />
<br />
Taylor was the first to feel something as one of them brushed the back of her knee. She pulled away for a moment and considered, Sam’s hands where nowhere near her knee, that animal side of her brain told her something was wrong. Sam must have felt the same as he seamed concerned and they quickly began to swim toward the shore, little did they know this was the last thing they wanted to do. Their kicking drew them in like moths to the flame as two of the creatures jockeyed closer. <br />
<br />
“Come on, something is in the water!” yelled Sam between breaths only to scream in pain as something bite his leg and latched on and began to drag him underwater. <br />
<br />
“Sam!!!” yelled Taylor as she dove under the water grabbing her boyfriend’s hand as he was pulled under. That is when she saw them, it was some kind of fish, they had to be about as big as she was and where covered with white scales. They had no side fins like normal fish or even eyes, but they had huge mouths and one of them had bitten Sam and was pulling him down. He was struggling as his blood entered the water. Then to her amazement it let go and swam away, they began to pull toward the surface when with leap it came from below and swallowed Sam’s legs up to the knee biting down causing more of his blood to fill the water. Taylor pulled and kicked with all her strength as she fought the creature pulling her boyfriend down and then with a matching move another one of those creatures lunged up from below and with a mouth opened wide swallowed her up to her rib cage, causing her blood to fill the water. <br />
<br />
The look of pure horror and sadness on Sam’s face as he watched what he assumed to be the death of the women he loves and soon his likely death filled his mind. With their thoughts on death, neither of them really noticed that the creatures had somehow swallowed more them then what was possible. Sam had stopped struggling for a moment as he grabbed Taylor pulling her close for one last embrace, as both of the creatures released them for a moment, Sam’s creature moved up to his waist and Taylor’s moved down to her waist. Then within seconds thousands of small needles like teeth shot into their bodies and with a final burst of pain both of them passed out and began to fall toward the bottom of the pool.  <br />
<br />
A few minutes later as both Sam and Taylor lied on the bottom of the pool, two merfolk swam forward and looked over them.<br />
<br />
“I never get used to the process.” Said the mermaid as they pulled Sam and Taylor apart. Already the mouths of the creatures was merging with their new human part, scales where growing upwards but that would stop around their belly buttons/lower backs. “Looks like we have a good match, both are breathing fine.”<br />
<br />
“And their new tails are merging with their bodies. I remember how painful that was.” said the merman as he studied Sam, both Sam’s and Taylor’s new tails where pure white but over the course of the merging that would change as the holy animal which gave them new lives under the sea would become one, their legs where fusing with their new tails and while for the moment their tails where breathing for them over time their upper body would change and their lungs would adapt to breath water as easily as water. <br />
<br />
“Make sure you grab their cloths; we don’t want to leave any signs unless someone else comes upon the pool.” Said the mermaid <br />
<br />
“Odds are the others will find a different pool but better safe then sorry.” Said the merman as he surfaced and pulled himself a bit onto the land and grabbed the human cloths before going back under the water. <br />
<br />
“Good, let’s get these two to a healing chamber, we may be very busy in a short amount of time.” Said the mermaid</p>
