<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I suppose I'll start off easy and dare you first,&quot; Jennifer stated.  She continued, &quot;Now like I said, we found out that this curse can do multiple things at once as long as the person giving the curse keeps talking.  That's what I'm going to do to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda, no longer being propped up by the other girls, fell to her knees and began to plead with Jennifer.  &quot;Please, Jenn, no.  I didn't do anything to you.  I didn't have anyone curse you.  Besides, I thought it wasn't real.  Why would I do that to you?&quot;  Not seeing a change in Jennifer's expression, she now begged, &quot;Please, I'll do anything you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot; Jennifer asked.  Her expression changed to a smile of satisfaction.  It was the kind of smile a person gives after getting a good grade or being rewarded for a job well done.  Miranda saw this and thought that Jennifer had accepted her pleas.  &quot;Alright, then, Miranda.  I agree.  You will do anything I want.&quot;  Miranda sighed deeply with relief.  Jennifer quickly shot back, &quot;But you'll do anything I want because I dare you too!  You will not change my mind!  You are going to be cursed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda would not go down so easily, however.  She rose to her feet and tried to regain her dignity.  &quot;Fine, then.  Do what you will.  You were right.  We have always been enemies.  But I never did anything like this to you.  I would have never gone this far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Jennifer could make her come back, Kylie interrupted.  &quot;Oh, but you did, Miranda.  You just don't remember it because I'm Kylie now and not Kyle.  Believe me when I tell you that.  And I have all of Kyle's memories.  I remember exactly how you scared him into doing what you wanted him to do.  You threatened that you would spread all kinds of rumors about him, and that you would have some of the football players make sure they abused him somehow every day.  How was he supposed to say no?  Just because you don't remember doing it doesn't make you innocent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda stood in shock.  Who the hell was Kylie to get in her face.  Jennifer was pretty shocked, too.  She didn't expect Kylie to take up Miranda on this in such a way.  But she was impressed.  Kyle would not have done something like that, but Kylie obviously would.  The changes in the personality were evident.  Jennifer was impressed with her handiwork, since she was taking credit for the change.  After all, she was the one who made the transformation.<br />
<br />
Kylie didn't stop there.  But her tone changed.  She said, &quot;In a way, I should thank you for what you did, Miranda.  After all, it led the four of them to come to Kyle, and change him to me.  And that has led me to starting a relationship with Jamie.  So, yes, I will thank you for making Kyle do that.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jennifer was upset with this change in Kylie's tone.  Before she could voice her displeasure, though, Kylie did another 180.  &quot;Even so, Miranda,&quot; Kylie continued, &quot;you dared to change Jenn.  And you should have known that you wouldn't get away with that.  Despite my thanking you for indirectly changing Kyle to me, you're still a horrible person.  You will get your comeuppance.&quot;  Finally having said her piece, Kylie turned back to Jennifer.  &quot;Sorry for being so rude, Jenn.  Give it to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer gave Kylie a look that said, &quot;Oh, well, yea.  OK, thanks.&quot;  She didn't know quite what to make of Kylie right about now.  She didn't have time to dwell on that now, as her focus shifted back to Miranda.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK.  As I said Miranda, I'll dare you first.  And, as I said, this will be a multiple dare.  I dare you, Miranda, to become my personal slave and do every little thing I tell you to do or want you to do, and as such, as you are now my slave, I dare you to not ever use this curse back on me, or anyone else for that matter, unless I specifically tell you when and how to use it, and I also dare you to never again wear a single piece of clothing unless I tell you specifically that you have to, and since you shall from here on always be naked I dare you to go naked everywhere and anywhere but not have anyone look shocked or try to get you in trouble for being naked, in short it will be perfectly natural for you to always be naked, however people will snicker at you behind your back and occasionally come up to you and make fun at you for being naked, but only as simple teasing for being naked though they will think that everything is normal about you being naked.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jennifer took in a long, deep breath, somewhat frantically gasping for air.  No one could blame her.  She had just said quite a mouthful, squeezing every possible bit she could into that dare.<br />
<br />
Miranda was still absorbing everything she had just been dared to do.  She was now completely at Jennifer's mercy.  And, apparently, she wasn't going to wear clothes at all.  On top of that, people would make fun of her at times, but otherwise think everything was normal.  She wanted to ask what the purpose of that was.  But she found that she could not.  Damn, she thought, that must be part of the curse.  She was finally able to ask, &quot;Can I ask you a question, Jenn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer had regained her composure.  She wanted to make Miranda call her &quot;Miss Jennifer&quot; like she had Kyle do, but decided it was just a waste of time.  &quot;Yes, you may, Miranda,&quot; Jennifer replied.  Miranda asked, &quot;Why are you going to have people make fun of me for being naked if they don't think anything is wrong with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer grinned.  &quot;Oh, Miranda, my dear,&quot; she mused, &quot;I have to have you humiliated somehow.  I do greatly admire your body, and since you're going to serve me, I figured I'd get some enjoyment out of it.  Like I said, I think I found out yesterday that I'm a little bi.  This way no one will think you are being immoral or wrong.  They'll just think you're weird, and as you know all too well, people in this school always make fun of people who are weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda wanted to scream and call Jennifer every bad name she could remember.  But she could not.  It seemed as though being dared to be a &quot;slave&quot; also meant that she could not say anything bad to or take issue with anything Jennifer told her to do.  She was screwed.<br />
<br />
Jamie, meanwhile, noticed a slight flaw in Jennifer's delivery of the curse.  In the interest of making the next part easier, she said to Jennifer, &quot;You know, Jenn, since she's now under your control and will only do what you tell her, you can just give her the transform one at a time, just to make sure you don't stumble over the words.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer shot Jamie a dirty look.  &quot;Did I stumble over the words on the dare?&quot; she demanded, her eyes shooting knives at Jamie's face.  &quot;I want to get this done as quickly as possible, so this is easiest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie shrugged her off.  &quot;OK, Jenn, it's your deal.  Just a suggestion was all.&quot;  Jennifer continued to look at her coldly and said, &quot;When I want your opinion, maybe I'll ask you for it.&quot;  It seemed as though whatever humility Jennifer might have learned the previous day had quickly gone away.  Or perhaps she was just trying not to show weakness in front of her new slave.  Jamie would just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; Jennifer said, looking back at Miranda.  &quot;It's time to be transformed.&quot;</p>
