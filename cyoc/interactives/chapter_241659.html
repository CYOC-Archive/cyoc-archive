<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Returning home after a visit to the fairy realm, Chase now made his way to Caleb&#39;s home alone. As the youngest Moreland brother said, it would be better if he talked with his brother one on one.<br />
<br />
As he drove, he thought of what Sarah told them. Whoever this Seraphim was, they were dangerous and connected to the church. The last part made the young hunter fidget nervously, although he could also chalk that up to his nerves after returning from the fae realm. Andromeda had stifled a chuckle after he measured his height three different times before apologizing. All she could do was apologize once more before promising something special down the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d I luck into a girl like Andromeda,&quot; Chase thought. &quot;She&#39;s perfect. Never thought I&#39;d fall this hard for someone. Then again never thought I&#39;d be shrunk either. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Parking in Caleb&#39;s driveway, Chase now slowly approached Caleb&#39;s front door. Chances were that Gloria was at work, while David and Marcus would be at school and preschool respectfully, leaving Caleb home alone with his youngest son Hank. The brothers often talked, Caleb&#39;s injuries having drawn the brothers closer. From what Chase learned, Caleb was doing well, but growing antsy as a stay at home father. After so many years working, the idea of sitting at home and being a house husband didn&#39;t sit well. Unfortunately for Caleb, for at least the next six months this would be his life. Knocking on the door, Chase gave his older brother a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chase?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Caleb,&quot; Chase said. &quot;Mind if we talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure come on in,&quot; Caleb said happily. &quot;Just keep the noise down, just put Hank down for a nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase nodded, following his brother inside. Glancing around the home, Chase noticed it appeared Caleb was in the middle of cleaning, a broom and mop haphazardly propped against a wall with a bucket holding the boys toys in the corner. Chase could even see the dishes from breakfast on the kitchen counter waiting to be washed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how&#39;s the stay at home husband life?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sucks,&quot; Caleb argued. &quot;Gloria always makes this look easy, even without magic. Still, it has its benefits. It&#39;s nice to have dinner with Gloria and the boys. David is so excited to have me home at night. Kinda made me think about growing up with dad. Wonder if he felt like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I knew,&quot; Chase shrugged. &quot;I can barely remember him at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb turned seeing the sorrowful expression on his brothers face. As much as he missed his father and wondered about the time they missed when he was a child, Chase had few memories of the man. Reaching out, he placed a hand on his brothers shoulder, offering him a reassuring smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I tell ya something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was a little jealous of you when you were born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, seriously?!&quot; Chase exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah ya dunce,&quot; Caleb laughed. &quot;See when I was a kid, dad was gone all the time. The few times he was home, he spent more time training than anything. With you and Charlotte. You two got dad 24 hours. He adored you, spent every moment he had with you....just being a dad, not a hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Caleb,&quot; Chase said, offering his brother a small smile. &quot;Hadn&#39;t thought of it like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if there&#39;s one thing I know Chase,&quot; Caleb grinned. &quot;Not a lot thoughts go through that head of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s the dick that I know and love,&quot; Chase chuckled, playfully shoving his older brother. &quot;And here I was thinking you went all soft on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not likely,&quot; Caleb grinned. &quot;Careful though, I&#39;m brittle. Now, what&#39;s up? See you&#39;re not with Andromeda. Everything okay with you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No we&#39;re great,&quot; Chase stated. &quot;She&#39;s at mom&#39;s with Nyx and Aaron. Needed to talk with you though and it&#39;s kinda serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb nodded, easing himself onto the couch as Chase spoke. The veteran hunter listening intently, his face becoming more grim as his little brother told him everything. A visit to the fae realm, speaking with Sarah, the Seraphim and their supposed connection to the church. Obviously Chase had been busy, Caleb realizing quite a bit was occurring as he recovered. Needless to say, as Chase finished, Caleb was concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;So a rogue hunter within the church known as the Seraphim,&quot; Caleb said softly. &quot;And Sarah thinks the church and hunters are aware of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I think,&quot; Chase shrugged. &quot;I mean... I don&#39;t think she meant to take a swipe at hunters but, this Seraphim guy seems to be connected to the church. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever they are it&#39;s not a hunter,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;And Sarah doesn&#39;t exactly have a good opinion of hunters. Her and I haven&#39;t exactly seen eye to eye since Connor. Partly my fault, but I can see why she would think the church and hunters were involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Caleb said firmly, scowling at his little brother. &quot;The church and hunters are not involved. I would know. That&#39;s the thing about being the head of the Moreland family, I&#39;ve got access to the Vatican vault. If there was something about this...Seraphim, it would be there. Whoever they are isn&#39;t part of the church....at least not officially.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grunting, Caleb stood grabbing his hat as he began to arm himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Chase asked in concern. &quot;Caleb you can&#39;t seriously be going out? You can barely move, let alone fight. What are you thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need some questions answered and the only one who can answer them is Archbishop Castignoli,&quot; he said. &quot;He won&#39;t talk to any of you, but he&#39;ll talk to me. I&#39;ll be an hour, no more than two. Gonna need you to watch Hank and DON&#39;T say anything to anyone until I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O..okay,&quot; Chase stammered. &quot;But I have no idea how to take care of a baby. What do I do when Hank wakes up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change his diaper and give him lunch,&quot; Caleb replied nonchalantly. &quot;You got this Chase. I&#39;m trusting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without another word, Caleb grabbed his key, strolling out the door leaving Chase behind. Chase tried to call out, watching Caleb&#39;s jeep kick up rocks and disappear down the road. If Caleb had listened, he would have heard his younger brother ask how to change a diaper.<br />
<br />
As Caleb drove, he now thought of Archbishop Peter Castignoli. Peter was an old friend of his father, the pair meeting when they were young. Caleb recalled meeting the Archbishop a few times during his childhood, before his father died. Since then, the Archbishop acted as his liason within the church. Since Caleb&#39;s injuries, Peter set himself up within the nearby diocese to keep tabs on the Moreland family. After all, with Caleb&#39;s future in flux, the idea of a new head of the Moreland family would mean Peter could be needed to perform the official ceremony marking the new head hunter.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Caleb found himself outside the large church the Archbishop resided in. To the outside world, this church looked as if it acted as not only a church, but a religious school as well. While the school was legit, it also served as headquarters for the hunters and it&#39;s liason. Approaching, Caleb noticed security eyeballing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
Caleb sized the security guard up. To the uninformed, this elderly man would appear to be a retired police officer or other member of law enforcement. A reasonably in shape individual who looked to be able to handle any possible situation that occurred at the school. It helped to put the families who sent their children here at ease. In reality, these men were retired priests. Monks to be specific who often accompanied hunters on exorcisms or as support staff. Each one was a formidable fighter, even in their 50s and 60s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need to speak with Archbishop Castignoli,&quot; Caleb stated, producing the family crest of the Moreland clan. &quot;It&#39;s important.&quot;<br />
<br />
The security guard, recognizing the crest, nodded opening a secret hatch on his desk as he pressed a button. Glancing over, Caleb watched as a metal door that could be mistaken for an electrical closet swing open. Tipping his hat, Caleb proceeded down a set of stairs that emptied into a small office like area.<br />
<br />
The area was interesting to say the least. A small reception area with an office, conference room, and small living area. Exiting his room, Archbishop Peter Castignoli smiled. At 72 years of age Peter was the same age that Jacob would&#39;ve been had he lived. The elderly man&#39;s hair grey and receding along the sides. He easily could pass for a man a decade younger with his bright eyes and full head of hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;Surprised to see you up and around. Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so Archbishop,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;Needed to talk with you. It&#39;s important.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Archbishop nodded, motioning for Caleb to take a seat. Offering the hunter some coffee, Peter leaned back in his chair a warm smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Archbishop,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;Needed some information. What do you know about someone known as the Seraphim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Seraphim?&quot; the Archbishop replied in confusion. &quot;I don&#39;t know of anyone by that name. The only Seraphim I&#39;m aware of is named in Christian texts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what S.P.E.A.R and Sarah McMillan say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter Castignoli&#39;s face now fell, forming into a scowl. The Archbishop now leaned forward, his eyes narrowing as he glared at Caleb.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think Caleb Moreland?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that I&#39;ve known you long enough that we can talk without hurting each others feelings,&quot; Caleb replied coldly. &quot;And if I believed her 100%, I wouldn&#39;t be here. Fact of the matter though is this. I may be the head of the Moreland Clan, but even I don&#39;t know everything about the inner workings of the church. Nor do I. You remember what I told you when I found out about the church&#39;s plans for Alyssa Kane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; the Archbishop replied. &quot;And I agreed with you. The church overstepped their boundaries. Why do you think I helped you? The ones who wanted Alyssa were a vocal minority, they were eventually excommunicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which brings us back to this Seraphim.&quot; Caleb said.<br />
<br />
Peter took a breath, the elderly priest sinking into his chair. &quot;Do you know how long I&#39;ve known your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over fifty years Caleb,&quot; Peter exclaimed. &quot;Fifty! Your father and I were the twins age when we met. Your mother was barely out of high school. I spent most of my twenties acting as Jacob&#39;s personal priest before the church promoted me and Nina retired. I have always looked out for your family and it is why I can say that this Seraphim is not connected to the church!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; the Archbishop sighed to Caleb&#39;s remark. &quot;There is a possibility that the vocal minority I spoke of may be involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It goes back to Connor,&quot; the Archbishop continued. &quot;And the damn Tepes family and that infernal woman Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb watched, the Archbishop perform the sign of the cross, seemingly asking forgiveness for losing his temperature in regards to both the vampires and S.P.E.A.R.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother was obviously furious as was I,&quot; he continued. &quot;When she told me about what happened to Connor and that...woman drew her weapon in defense of vampires against you, we were furious. We felt betrayed, the entire church did. Defending vampires who were so clearly responsible for crippling your brother. It was why the church and hunters severed ties with S.P.E.A.R.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it didn&#39;t stop there did it?&quot; Caleb asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the Archbishop said sadly. &quot;No it did not. The church and some of its more.....fanatical followers became at odds. Some wished to go to war against not only the vampires, but S.P.E.A.R itself. A war against an American agency, even one that does not technically exist, would be suicide. I personally, along with several elder leaders refused. Those who did not fall in line were excommunicated from the church.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think that&#39;s where this Seraphim comes from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly,&quot; the Archbishop replied. &quot;That minority were able to persuade a handful of hunters into joining their cause. They were the ones who proposed abducting Alyssa Kane before you hid the girl. We tossed them out, froze their funds, and drove them underground. We haven&#39;t heard from them in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter nodded, the elderly priest looking quite tired now. &quot;Caleb,&quot; he said, his voice little more than a whisper. &quot;If the Seraphim is connected to these fanatics than tread carefully. Before they were thrown out, they began to act like cultists. I fear if they are responsible, they won&#39;t settle for simply destroying vampires. They&#39;ll go after anyone who they believe stands in their way, including you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Appreciate the concern Archbishop,&quot; Caleb stated, standing as he shook the old priest&#39;s hand. &quot;Promise I&#39;ll be cautious and jeep you in the loop. Take care of yourself too Pete, chances are you might be on their hit list too.&quot; As Caleb turned to leave, he stopped and quickly turned back to Archbishop Peter Castignoli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh....one other thing you should know: Chase and my apprentice Aaron have girlfriends now, and both of them are....the daughters of the Tepes family.&quot; Caleb said as the Archbishop looked surprised at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.....I suppose it&#39;s true what they say: the lord works in mysterious ways.&quot; The Archbishop said as Caleb gave a slight smile and nod to him before finally leaving.</p>
