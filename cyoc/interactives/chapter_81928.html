<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I'll start with you, Stephen,&quot; I said.  &quot;I'm guessing you work out a little, right?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, but I'm not trying to look like him,&quot; he said, pointing at Bozantum.  &quot;I just want to stay in shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, to fit in with my group, you'll need a little more oomph,&quot; I said.  I wished that he would grow three inches taller, so he'd be about 6'3&quot;.  I also wished that he'd grow a bit more muscular, not as muscular as either Bozantum or Jucodon, but more than he was now.  I wished also that his cock would grow another two inches.  That would put his in the same general size category as his two male counterparts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; he said as he felt the changes wash over him.  Two minutes later and he was a changed man.  &quot;This feels pretty good, actually,&quot; he said.  He looked at Theresa.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Theresa walked over to him and ran her hands over his enhanced arms and chest.  She gave them light squeezes.  &quot;It feels nice from this end,&quot; she said.  &quot;But you're so tall now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; I said.  &quot;You'll gain a few inches, too.&quot;  I wished Theresa would grow to 5'11&quot; in height, so that she would gain a total of five inches.  I wished that she'd get curvier so that she would have an hourglass figure.  This meant her hips and ass would need to grow a bit larger and rounder, while her waist would have to contract a tiny bit.  I wished her arms and legs would become fitter and well-toned.  I wished that her face would smooth out a bit so it wouldn't have signs of wear.  And I wished that her breasts would increase from their current B-cup size to a more robust D-cup.  I thought her hair looked fine as it was.<br />
<br />
Theresa looked stunned as she steadily changed into her improved body.  Once her changes finished she ran her hands over her face and body to confirm that they were hers.  She looked at all of us and her face told me she wanted to hear opinions.  Bozantum spoke first.  &quot;You look fabulous,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you're really fucking hot,&quot; I said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Theresa tried to laugh at that remark, too, but was unable to.  She looked at Stephen.  It was obvious that she needed his approval the most.  He looked at her up and down and said, &quot;I didn't think there was anything wrong with you in the first place.  But I would be lying if I said you didn't look better now.  You're gorgeous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theresa heard what she needed to hear.  She embraced Stephen tightly.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next thing is clothing,&quot; I said.  &quot;You've probably already noticed, Stephen, that we don't wear much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; he said, sounding a bit confused.  &quot;You don't wear anything.  Why isn't that weird to me?  I know it should be, but it's not.&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned at him.  &quot;All part of my power,&quot; I said.  &quot;For your clothing, Stephen, I have to tell you that the men in our group have a bit of a uniform attire.&quot;  I wished for a loincloth similar to that of Bozantum to appear.  I tossed it to him and had him put it on.  Theresa helped him with this.  Now I needed something else to differentiate him from both Bozantum and Jucodon.  He would need something around his neck, just like Jucodon had.  I decided to make it tie into his fantasy.  I wished for what amounted to a necklace made of imitation fur that was supposed to resemble a tiger's fur.  Instead of it being like a woman's necklace, it would be like Jucodon's neckpiece in that it would be several inches in size and it would go around the front and back of his body.  It would actually more closely resemble a dickey as opposed to a necklace, but it wouldn't be quite that thick.  The garment I imagined appeared and he happily put it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this,&quot; he said.  &quot;Kind of shows me off and makes me look tough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it, too,&quot; agreed Theresa.<br />
<br />
I figured that Theresa would prefer to be more covered.  Even though she'd loosened up quite a bit since her time as a tiger, I wasn't going to push her too far.  Especially since I'd just changed her appearance.  Keeping in line with the somewhat mythical or ancient civilization-type ideas I'd been forming, I wished for a dress that more looked like a toga.  It was all white, but somewhat frumpy looking.  It fit her perfectly, and it covered all body parts that it normally should.<br />
<br />
I wished for it to appear and gave it to her.  She put it on dutifully.  Once she had it on all the way, she looked disappointed.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.  &quot;It's fine, I guess.  It just seems like...too much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it too heavy?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little,&quot; she said.  I wasn't sure how to make it &quot;lighter,&quot; per se, so I wished that the material would be thinner.  This also made the garment slightly more transparent, though it was not see-through.  &quot;That's better,&quot; she said.  &quot;But...&quot;  She still didn't appear satisfied, but she didn't tell me what she disliked.  Instead she just went about adjusting it herself.  Much to my surprise, she slid the strap off her right shoulder and forced it down.  She then pushed down the garment so that her right breast was exposed.  However, she kept the strap on her left shoulder where it was.  &quot;I kinda like this look,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...OK,&quot; I said, a little startled.  I thought it looked a bit awkward, however, so I made another wish to alter the garment again.  It kept the look she wanted, but it looked more natural now.  Essentially it was a dress that had half the top part cut off.  &quot;I have to say you're surprising me right now,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; she said.  &quot;If we're all going to change, I should change a little, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well spoken,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;Now, like I said, I want to change your names a little.  I want them to sort of reflect your...let's call them 'alter egos.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; they both said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephen, from now on you will be known as...'Stephgress,'&quot; I said.  &quot;That way it combines 'Stephen' with tigress.  What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can handle that,&quot; he said.  &quot;Can you?&quot; he asked Theresa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; I said.  &quot;Theresa...hmm, let's see.&quot;  I had to think for a minute.  I wanted to incorporate at least part of the word &quot;tiger,&quot; into her name, while still keeping the foundation of her name.  This would be tougher.  &quot;Theresa, you will be known as 'Thigersa.'  What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I like that a lot,&quot; she said.  &quot;What about you?&quot; she asked Stephgress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it fits you perfectly,&quot; he said.  &quot;'Thigersa' sounds ferocious.&quot;<br />
<br />
I clapped my hands together.  &quot;I am so happy,&quot; I said.  &quot;Now we shall leave and you can meet the rest of our group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thigersa and Stephgress took each other's hands and intertwined their fingers.  This told me that they'd be forever united with each other.  I had to admit that I felt extremely satisfied to have brought them together.  &quot;We're ready, my goddess,&quot; they said in unison.<br />
<br />
I quickly made the necessary wishes for no one to think their dress was wrong or abnormal, and so that they didn't have to wear anything on their feet.  &quot;Let us go,&quot; I said.</p>
