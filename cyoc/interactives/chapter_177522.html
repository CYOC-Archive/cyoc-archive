<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sr. Felicia decided to remove her habit, loosen her frock, and adjust her hair into a sexyily-messy look. The secretary buzzed:<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael Salavatore is here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Nancy. Please send him in.&quot;<br />
<br />
In walked Mike, while the two boys were sitting in the secretary&#39;s office, waiting for further punishment and lectures to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,  Mr. Salvatore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, sister. My, you look....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I look, Mr. Salvatore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh hum,&quot; he said as he cleared his throat. &quot;You can call me Mike.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok....Mike. You may approach my desk, &quot; she said huskily. <br />
<br />
Mike, in a near sweat, walked on over to her desk as she flipped open to the spell to switch bodies. <br />
<br />
Sr. Felicia pressed a button to contact Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you also please send in Noah?&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Who&#39;s Noah?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to be punished, Mr. Salvatore?&quot; asked the nun. &quot;Like....a little boy?&quot; she added sexually.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s heart started racing. &quot;Uh. Yeah. Sure,&quot; he said, as a crooked smile crossed his face; wondering what she had in mind.<br />
<br />
The door opened behind him, and in stepped a young blond boy. Mike instantly recognized him as his son&#39;s best friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! That Noah! Hi there, buddy! How you doin&#39;?&quot; he asked the kid as he ruffled his hair. <br />
<br />
The nun started chanting as the man and boy stopped,  facing each other. The nun walked menacingly over to Mike, and looked at him with lust. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take a good long look down at young Noah here. See that young youthful smooth face of his?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s going to be the face; those will be the eyes; staring back at you everytime you look in a mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What are you-?&quot;<br />
<br />
The nun swiped both of her arms across her body in opposite directions as she hurriedly said the word &quot;switch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike suddenly found his perspective much lower, and was looking in the opposite direction. And instead of looking down at a kid, he was look up.....at.....himself! With much longer hair shading mostly his right eye. Lighter-colored hair.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the nun started reading the next spell she had prepared. The spell that would change Noah&#39;s mind into Mike&#39;s. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- what?&quot; Mike murmered in his new higher-pitched voice.<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself, and discovered he was now wearing a boy&#39;s Catholic school uniform! A blue blazer with the school crest of tbe school his mother insisted he attend on the left breast. A blue tie, with a white collarshirt underneath. He was now wearing blue pants with a black belt,  and black dress shoes.<br />
<br />
He brought his hands up to feel his shrunken chest and the preppy clothes he was now wearing. He then noticed his hands weren&#39;t his hands! The hands he now had were much smaller and daintier. The skin tone much lighter. His fingers looked long and thin, with perfectly manicured nails.<br />
<br />
As Mike was busy inspecting himself, the nun finished the spell. Noah, now also Michael Salvatore, &quot;woke up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh. Sorry. What were we talking about again?&quot; he asked, turning towards the sexy Latina nun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right. My kid&#39;s behavior. I&#39;ll make sure to have a talk with him tonight. I see you already have another little appointment,&quot; he said, grinning down at the little blond boy who was his son&#39;s best friend that had just walked into the office. He reached down, and ruffled the boy&#39;s hair as he smirked and walked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Mike piped up, as his body ruffled his new medium-length blond locks on his new head. He was still so taken aback by what had transpired, that he hesitated too long to follow....himself....? out of the office. The principal quickly ran over to tbe door and shut it. <br />
<br />
Mike looked UP at her, his mouth agape and cheeks flushed. He suddenly felt small and intimdated with this much larger woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, NOAH, &quot; she started, emphasizing the new name Mike is now stuck with. &quot;This is your chance to flip out. After this, you must understand you are now a 10 year, blond-haired, green-eyed,  Catholic school boy named Noah. Noah Baxter.&quot; A name that couldn&#39;t be more white.<br />
<br />
All Mike (now Noah), could do was just stand there, open-mouthed. Staring down at his shrimpified school boy form. <br />
<br />
As he was standing there discovering his new youthful form, the young nun was flipping through the former Noah&#39;s book, and came upon a ledger in the back. It seems as though the ledger magically records the history of the spells used. She raised an eyebrow as she noticed that Noah had already used one spell. He used it on himself. An age spell. A spell that prevents the caster&#39;s body from ever aging. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hah. Haha. Hahahaha, &quot; she slowly chuckled outloud. &quot;Oh, my.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, Mike was finished &quot;discovering hinself,&quot; and looked up at the Catholic nun. Fear and shock on his young little hairless face. Also,  a bit of anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me!?&quot; He practically sgrieked at her in his prebubescent little boy&#39;s voice. &quot;You actually turned me into a....into a...a...KID!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sister flipped the book shut, and looked down at her charge sternly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, listen here, young man, there will be no shouting in my office!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouting? SHOUTING!? You did something to me! Im now short and wearing a school bky&#39;s uniform as I watched my body walk out of here! You did sonething to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. You were gross impertinant man, and I fixed that! You are now Noah Baxter, and you shall now live out his life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noah!? You mean. You mean. My son Brady&#39;s best buddy!?&quot; He asked, calming himself down a bit in the hopes she could and would fix this .<br />
<br />
&quot;The one and only, &quot; she said,  as she stood at her full height over the newly-christened boy. The third spell she had cast, was one to increase her intimidation factor over school children. Mostly so she could more effectively do her job. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, &quot; she said standing tall and dark over him. &quot;I will have your cooperation in this matter. Once this conversation is over, I will never acknowledge that you were once Michael Salvatore. You can tell the whole world to your heart&#39;s content, but everyone will think you&#39;re just a kid with an overactive imagination. Indeed, thats all theyll see. Is just some crazy ten year old boy who likes to make up stories.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Matter of fact, she continued, &quot; that&#39;s all I see right now. Literally, all i see is Noah Baxter standing there, looking up at me like an impertinant little boy you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I-&quot; Mike found himself suddenly grow shy with intidimation in the presence of this much taller adult towering over him, with unseen and unsourced powers. <br />
<br />
She picked up the book back up,  and quickly said: &quot;turn this child to stone!&quot; she interrupted. <br />
<br />
Mike suddenly froze completely solid in place. Mouth still partially open, trying to complete what he was in the middle of trying to say before she turned him into a statue. His big green eyes turned to dull grey rock, still staring upwards. His irses perfectly carved into his eyeballs and with near-lifelike intensity. <br />
<br />
Mike found he suddenly couldn&#39;t move. Not even the slightest twitch of the slightest muscle! He was stuck standing in one place,  his stare unmoving and unflinching. Still looking up at this woman standing over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; he thought. &quot;I cant  move! Did she just turn me into a god damn STATUE!?&quot; He kept trying to move. Anything. He felt panic rising, like being buried alive. Or like drowning under a sheet of ice. Even his uniform had turned to stone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, &quot; she said,  getting down to his level as his entire body was petrified to stone. She looked directly into his wide stone eyes and placed a hand gently on his stone cold hard right cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what you need to know, &quot; she continued. She then gave a breakdown of Noah&#39;s family,  as far as she knew based on her observations and on his student record. The entire time, Mike was struggling mentally against his physically petrified boyish form.<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on,&quot; she continued some more duri g her lecture. &quot;You will come to school like the boy you are,  and live out Noah Baxter&#39;s life. I can imbue some of his childish personality onto you, so as to limit a sudden appearance of different personality. But you will still have freedoms, of course. You can say whatever you want to say. But you WILL come to school like all the other school children. And you&#39;ll more or less obey your teachers and your new mither like Noah would have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you do decide to fail to show up to school,&quot; she went on, &quot;we could use a new statue of a school boy in front of our school. And there, you would remain forevermore in your stony school outfit. Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike remained silent. Statues cant speak. They cant even wimper,  which is what Mike so desparately wanted to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Right. You cant speak, &quot; she said. She undid the petrification curse on the boy. Mike suddenly fell backwards onto the ground, gasping for breath as tears  welled up in his quickly reddening eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please! Don&#39;t turn me into a statue again!&quot; he said,  looking up at her through his tear-filled eyes.  Terror on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. That&#39;s better. Now. Did you hear all that I told you as you stood there as an inaninate object?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! I promise! I&#39;ll do anything! I just do t ever want to be turned to stone again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sister Felicia chuckled. &quot;My dear boy. That was merely just for five minutes, and you&#39;re blubberibg like the child you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now. Just remember what that five minutes felt like as a statue. If you don&#39;t heed my warnings, there will be no going back. You&#39;ll be stuck standing in one place on a pedestal out front of the main doors. Day and night. Rain and shine. Every minute of every day, for years and years. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye- yes!&quot; Mike sniffled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now. This is friday, and I expect you to be here early Monday morning when your bus drops you off. Here&#39;s a tissue. And for god&#39;s sake, get up off the floor. You&#39;ll dirty your uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
The secretary buzzed the principal&#39;s office as Mike grabbed the tissue and picked himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noah Baxter&#39;s mom is here to pick him from his after school detention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Send her in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and one more thing,&quot; she said as she hung up with the secretary and before his new mother came in. &quot;Noah cast an ageless spell on himself last night. Which means, you&#39;ll forever be stuck as a ten year old boy.....Hello Ms. Baxter, &quot; the sister quickly switched gears as Mike&#39;s new mom entered her office. Unable finish her explanation to Mike.<br />
<br />
Mike couldn&#39;t believe it! No way,  was he going to stuck as a little ten year old boy! And certainly not be stuck wearing a Catholic school uniform! But what was he to do? He decided in his mind to keep quiet and remain patient for now. Afterall,  he didnt ever want to experience being statufied ever again. He had no doubt Sister Felicia coukd and would do it again. Maybe not in front of other people. Ceetainly not in front of his mom. But she will find a tine and location to turn him back into a statue. And this time,  for good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, &quot; he thought to himself. &quot;Did I really just think of that lady as &#39;mom?&#39;&quot; He rolled his eyes,  as the two women began to speak sternly to him abiut apparently not paying attention in class, and for encouraging Brady&#39;s antics. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dont you roll your eyes at me, young man! There will be no movie tonight from the video store. And no popcorn!&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason, Mike felt some odd disappointment well up in him. He whined and huffed briefly. But then thought to hinself:<br />
<br />
&quot;No movie night? Why should I care?&quot;<br />
<br />
But he did care nonetheless. No movie night.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sister. I hope to not have to pick him up again for this. Come on, Noah. We&#39;re going home. And you&#39;re going straight to your room, then getting washed up. And no video games either!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But mom-&quot; Mike started whining like a young boy would.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean it, mister!&quot; she interrupted. &quot;Now, let&#39;s go home.&quot; <br />
<br />
Already,  Noah&#39;s personality was showing through. Mike was stunned. He had just switched bodies with a child,  turned into a statue for a few minutes, and had been whipped by two women <br />
he had no relations with at all. All in under an hour. He knew he was going to follow this particular woman out of the office, into a car,  and to this kid&#39;s home where he was now grounded from movie night and video games.</p>
