<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you guys wanna experiment with our form?&quot; Sean asked his friends. They both looked at him like he was fucking crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just hold off on getting too wild until we know all the mechanics of this situation.&quot; Jay said. Sean nodded his head submissively because Jay was right. They had been fused together not even an hour yet. They might get stuck in something weird. Right now, they were just a three-headed college kid. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind having my own arms, though. That isn&#39;t too wild.&quot; He said and they pushed. Their individual arms started splitting out from their fused ones. They had six arms all sprouting from the same pair of shoulders, one set behind the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa. Do you guys feel that?&quot; Dan asked. They nodded, turning their heads slightly. They tried looking behind them and saw that their back had extended backwards slightly to accommodate the arms. &quot;I&#39;m just not used to feeling that weight back there.&quot; It was an odd feeling to have a pair of arms behind your own and then, another one behind that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, geez. What are we going to do? We&#39;ll have to change our majors to something we all want. Hell, we could always try doing a triple major but no one survives those.&quot; Jay said, starting to fret over all the life details they would have to figure out. Dan and Sean moved one of their hands each to his face, or at least the best they could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s gonna be alright.&quot; Sean said. Jay looked freaked out and Sean and Dan had no idea why.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys just fused your faces again but only the lower halves.&quot; The two didn&#39;t even realize that they had done it but putting one of their hands up they realized the two heads only had one mouth and their noses were side by side until their faces split again. They pulled apart and held their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was weird. We had no idea.&quot; Dan said. That was quite odd that they did it subconsciously. They wondered what other effects the Chronivac had. Unfortunately, they were about to find out. They heard a ding from the doorbell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great. Who could that be?&quot; Jay said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit. Michael was coming over today.&quot; Sean said. &quot;I totally forgot in this fusion business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, you guys.&quot; Dan tried to calm everybody down. &quot;Let&#39;s just... answer the door like normal.&quot; Another ding from the doorbell was heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Jay and Sean both said. They, however, did not fuse their mouths. <br />
<br />
&quot;You heard me. People are going to have to get used to it. Michael&#39;s our best friend. It isn&#39;t going to matter to him.&quot; He explained. The sighed in agreement. They moved to the door and slowly opened it up. Michael was just as tall as they were. He had dark brown eyes and dark red hair. He was a ginger but not the typical bright red hair. It was almost like a dark fire, really.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys... What did you guys do?&quot; He asked, not necessarily scared or surprised but worried if they were okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story. Why don&#39;t you come in?&quot; Sean said, motioning with one of his arms to enter. Michael did and they shut the door. They had a seat on opposite couches as Jay, Dan and Sean started to explain what happened. They mentioned the Chronivac and its autosave functionality. How they woke up completely fused and how the separation works. Michael just sat patiently and waited for the three of them to be done. He appeared to offer absolutely no judgement which was just like Michael. He doesn&#39;t judge people because he knows it isn&#39;t his place.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, that handheld machine did this?&quot; He asked. They nodded. He gave a questioning grunt. &quot;It must work by rewriting your atomic structure relative to space and time.&quot; That pretty much soared over their heads. &quot;Sorry, I am a Physics Major. Its not really prudent to say something like this is impossible because most of physics is theoretical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, you&#39;ve got the brains in this group. We have to pick new majors probably, thanks to our new situation.&quot; Jay said. Michael got up, quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I&#39;ll help you pick a new one. Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got in your bookcase.&quot; Michael got up and went right over to their books. He was so enthralled in didn&#39;t even notice that the boys were coming over and standing right behind him as he turned around, slamming right into their tall frame. They all fell over and couldn&#39;t get back up. &quot;I can&#39;t get up. Guys, I can&#39;t get off of you.&quot; They all gave a gulp as they were all pulled down in a way. Michael was pulled further and further into Jay, Sean and Dan&#39;s body as their heads all came together. Their body became sort of a vaguely human shape as the Chronivac started spouting out commands and such:<br />
<br />
&quot;Function Rewrite: F(x) = FusUnit1(F1+F2+F3)+NewF4&quot;<br />
<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the club, Michael.&quot; Sean said as they sat there on that couch. &quot;It&#39;s probably a good thing we explained the rules to you ahead of time because we&#39;re stuck like this. There is absolutely no way out of this without dying, which is not preferable.&quot; Michael chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, guys. You don&#39;t have to keep keep bagging on yourselves.&quot; He said. &quot;This might actually be fun, you know?&quot; He said, but the other three looked at him skeptically. Their heads were all in a row so they actually just glance over by turning their heads slightly. Michael placed one of his hands on his chin. Their arms were now arranged in two sets of four: four arms to one pair of shoulders, one underneath the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking about down there?&quot; Jay asked Michael from the other end of the body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had a date tonight after I was done here. If you guys wanted to go, I&#39;m sure my reservation will still count if we can use one chair.&quot; Michael explained. &quot;I&#39;m sure my date would love have to a few extra gentlemen at the table... and in other places.&quot; He said, moving his eyebrows. The others were pretty much on board. <br />
<br />
&quot;Its a good thing that the Chronivac fused our clothes too.&quot; Sean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and it changes them too when we do.&quot; Dan mentioned. The four of them were excited. Only after a few hours, they simply didn&#39;t care. They were proud to be living as a composite person. The four of them, the best friends in the entire world, get to be conjoined together and get to share everything, even a boyfriend.</p>
