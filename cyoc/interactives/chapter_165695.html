<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The jackass show was running. Madelyn and Danielle, wanting to see more, went on stage. Despite not having hands, with their front legs they managed to get on. But a big burly man was now standing front of them. <br />
<br />
“Halt.” he smirked. “What do you want?” he asked Danielle, ignoring the brown jenny next to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeeehawwwwww! I waaaaaaaaawwwntto go into club &quot; She said in a gruff dumb voice <br />
<br />
“Why do you want that, lady?” The man asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I waaaaawwwwnnnt to see the jawwwwwwwcks&quot; Danielle brayed.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I wanted to hear! In you go. I’ll see you girls soon!” The man stepped aside and Madelyn brayed happily and followed her friend in. <br />
<br />
As they walked inside, the jacks were still dancing about on stage, some young men were dancing alongside them, changing with each twirl they made on stage. There were hardly any humans left, just braying, blissful, simple minded donkeys. Any humans that remained were too busy cheering and braying to stay human for long. Not that Danielle cared, her eyes were too focused on the jacks. <br />
<br />
Madelyn brayed happily and wandered off towards a jack in the crowd. Danielle smiled as she soaked up the sights of the changing crowd, slowly wandering until she found herself in a more secluded area.<br />
<br />
It was in fact a VIP room, though given Danielle’s present mental state reading was a difficult task for her. <br />
<br />
Then, Danielle saw a young and good looking man entering to a room. She could barely contain her excitement, he smelled like a male donkey. <br />
<br />
He was Mark, he’d volunteered for this a while back, and now the time had finally come...to take his place as a braying animal! No more bills, no more work...just grass and sleep! <br />
<br />
When Mark opened the door, he found the prettiest young half-jenny he had ever seen. Danielle was in front of him on hind legs with human arms placed on the ground. He reached up silently and scratched behind one of her ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh..ohhhhh heeeee-haaaawww&quot; Danielle brayed in a low voice as she smiled a goofy and pleased smile. The sensation of having her ears rubbed was almost intoxicating. Mark came into view, revealing his unchanged body. “Do you like what you see?”<br />
<br />
Danielle smiled and nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d beeeeeehawwwwwww a pretty jenny.&quot; Mark said. He stroked her ears as he felt his own stretching. “Then again, you aren’t a young woman, are you?” Danielle shook her head <br />
<br />
&quot;I’m a proud donkeeeeeeehaaaawwww&quot; Danielle said with pride in her braying voice <br />
<br />
“Such a nice jenny needs a strong jack!” Mark said with a smile as he felt the prickling of gray fur spreading over his foot long ears. “Do you know where you could find one?” <br />
<br />
Danielle looked at him with a dopey grin “Heeeeeeehaaaawwwww-here&quot; she said with glee as she started to nuzzle at him, causing grey fur to start growing on his arms. <br />
<br />
“Oh my? The cute jenny would have me as her big strong jack?” With a loud rip, a tail shot out of his shorts. “You do seem to be bringing out the donkey in me.” He smiled at her with glee as his hands started to meld, forming into hooves to match his feet. <br />
<br />
Slowly Danielle started to kiss and nuzzle at his arms to help encourage the changes, both for him and for herself. His torso began to thicken and widen as his chest started to barrel out <br />
<br />
“Heeee-HAW! OH! You already have my braying!” Mark said happily as he willingly dropped to his hands and knees. The moment he did, his hands and feet seemed to flow into hooves and his hips cracked, locking him on all fours. <br />
<br />
“Giveeeee meee a big kiss, my jaaaaaaawwwwwck.” Danielle said. Mark crawled closer so he was a few inches away from Danielle’s nose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okaaayyeeeeeeehaaaawwww &quot; Mark brayed happily as he edged himself closer, kissing her deeply, feeling a wave of pleasure and bliss take him. <br />
<br />
Later, the place was now full of donkeys. No humans were left, even the bartender had fallen victim to his inner donkey. Clothes were scattered all over the floor or were in shredded pieces on the donkeys. <br />
<br />
The sight pleased Danielle, as she felt comfortable and secure around her fellow animals. She started to look around for her friend Madelyn. <br />
<br />
Madelyn grazed happily next to her new mate, Justin. She found him in the back of the club, a strong black jack to share her life with. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Madelyn heard a familiar bray and looked up to see Danielle trotting towards her with a strange jack next to her. Madelyn brayed a greeting and returned to her grazing. <br />
<br />
Danielle greeted Madelyn with a bray as the two seemed to almost have a conversation of sorts. The gray jenny then started to graze with her friend and mate as a group of men walked into view, talking to each other audibly. <br />
<br />
Madelyn didn’t understand much of what they were saying, but she let them lead her away into a dark cave. She found herself in a corral filled with donkeys. <br />
<br />
Danielle stood beside Mark and Madelyn, looking around the corral curiously while nuzzling her mate, too simple minded to feel any sense of urgency. Madelyn clopped slowly up a ramp and found herself in a massive cave filled with donkeys. She brayed a greeting to everyone, but many of them seemed to be panicked or sad. <br />
<br />
The burly man from earlier was in the center. <br />
<br />
Danielle followed, along with Mark, as they looked at the scared donkeys. She felt rather sad for them, wondering what had them all so spooked. To her left, Danielle could hear the burly man from before, speaking things She didn&#39;t fully understand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Speak&quot; the man said to one of the donkeys, who started speaking backin the same strange language &quot;Please...change me back...I don’t wanna be a donkey&quot; the little young jenny whispered out. <br />
<br />
“Then you should have listened to your parents.” The man looked up to another human. “Put her in the corral with the others, take them to the pasture. They’ll lose their voice eventually. Next!” <br />
<br />
Danielle and her mate trotted up to the man curiously when they heard the word next, as though something in their minds told them to go to him. <br />
<br />
Danielle’s mind slowly started to wander off to what was wrong with that little jenny, and why it was speaking so strangely as she found herself standing in front of the man. <br />
<br />
“Two? ”Then the man laughed. “I probably don’t even need to test you two. Can you tell me your names?” <br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEEEEHAAAAAWWWW&quot; Danielle brayed at her vaguely understanding the man had asked her to speak. She smiled with pride, feeling she brayed well as a good donkey should as she looked up at the man.<br />
<br />
The man looked closely at Danielle’s eyes. He smiled. “Wow, usually they keep their human eyes. These two apparently embraced being a donkey. Well I have just the place for you two!” He led the two donkeys to the corral reserved for the animals that would pull his carriage.<br />
<br />
Only kids who completely shunned their humanity, willingly, would be here.<br />
“Nex-wha?” Madelyn and Justin trotted after the first two donkeys into the corral, dull brown eyes fixed on the pair in front of them. “Well...no need to test those two either!”</p>
