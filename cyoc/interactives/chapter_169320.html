_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Morgan and Caleb crossed campus together. It was a peculiar experience, because all the while they walked and passed other students, they imagined they were undercover in a way. Something else that struck them was their change of pace. Both Morgan and Caleb were fairly tall in their true bodies, but as Seth and Andrew with their shorter legs, walking was a bit different. Each step went a little shorter than it would have before, but they also were swinging the next leg quicker.<br />
<br />
They probably looked high, Morgan thought, as they took weird steps and looked around like they just stole something. Quite the opposite, of course, but no one really hands you an instruction book on how to handle suddenly being in someone else&#39;s body and having to learn the length of their legs or how much weaker or stronger they are.<br />
<br />
And furthermore, there were some aspects that Morgan wondered if he should be grossed out at. For instance, as he flicked his tongue across Seth&#39;s teeth, he could feel the build-up of plaque and tartar because Seth didn&#39;t seem the most hygienic. But when he thought it through more, it wasn&#39;t his tongue, it was Seth&#39;s tongue. So all the nasty things he was experiencing, were actually normal facets of Seth&#39;s life. It was sort of a paradox, because although his mind was uncomfortable and sometimes even disgusted with what he experienced, technically the body was quite used to these sensations or habits.<br />
<br />
As they neared Andrew&#39;s dorm, Morgan also pondered about what they intended. Was this the goal of Seth and Andrew? Morgan may be fat, but he was clean and generally good about doing his laundry when it needed to be done. And Caleb was known as a fairly meticulous guy for cleaning his room and bodily hygiene. Seth on the other hand, as Morgan had already noted, was not very bothered with cleanliness. His room had been pretty sloppy, and his personal hygiene was atrocious. He didn&#39;t seem to brush too often, his hair seemed like it had endured many water-only showers, he was certain he wasn&#39;t using deodorant, and his clothes were wrinkled and in some places a little crusty. The odor was faint, but still it was clear he needed to do a load or many of laundry. Perhaps what Seth and Andrew wanted was a brief vacation from themselves, and while the &quot;tenants&quot; were out, the temporary occupants would feel obliged to put in some serious upkeep and maintenance.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, what if Seth and Andrew are annoyed with them for what they intended to do. Caleb was about to shave off probably over a years worth of hair growth. And Morgan had no idea sort of biological clock or rhythm these strange nerds adhered to. Maybe suddenly washing Seth&#39;s hair more actively would cause him to break out in more acne, or he suffers from a really dry scalp? At least any accidental discomfort Morgan incurred would be temporary. As bizarre as every moment was, he had to take solace in the belief that he would get his body and life back in the near future.<br />
<br />
As the two entered Andrew&#39;s dorm, folks seemed to give the pair of them wary looks. Morgan couldn&#39;t tell if it was his paranoia, or if folks actually seemed to think they were weirdos. Spurred on by the thought, they rushed up and found Andrew&#39;s single. There was at least one thing to be grateful for. Inside they found a fairly neat space, albeit with a musty odor. There, they rooted around in Andrew&#39;s stuff until they found his shaving supplies. Most of it untouched, as they strange little cinephile tried to grow the ridiculous patch of hair on his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m about to obliterate this little shit&#39;s ugly-ass goatee. God, who even thinks goatees are attractive these days?&quot; Caleb said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, look at this room. He&#39;s got all these old films on blue-ray. He&#39;s a snob. He probably thought the goatee made him look special or like some old film buff.&quot; Morgan posited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever the case, wanna come watch me hack it off?&quot; Caleb asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For sure, let&#39;s do this.&quot; Morgan cackled while rubbing his hands together like a supervillain.<br />
<br />
They scurried down the hall until they found a single-occupant handicap bathroom. Looking at each other, they grinned knowing that if anyone had any thoughts about them doing something weird, at least it wasn&#39;t their real bodies.<br />
<br />
Inside, Caleb wasted no time getting set up, lathering his face, and going to work on the goatee. Since it wasn&#39;t much hair, it didn&#39;t take too much time. The two imagined he must maintain the rest of his facial hair, just leaving the patchy goatee to try and grow rampant. When Caleb washed off the remaining hair and cream, he looked up into the mirror right at Andrew&#39;s now barren face. <br />
<br />
The two friends shot each other a look. Morgan broke the silence first. &quot;Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you&#39;re thinking he&#39;s actually not that ugly without the goatee... it&#39;s what I was thinking.&quot; Caleb stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right?!&quot; Morgan exclaimed, utterly lost for an explanation. &quot;Someone doesn&#39;t just become like half-way decent looking without facial hair like that, can they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have fucking believed it either.&quot; Caleb said. The two just looked surprised, and when they exited the bathroom not even the stern look of a passing RA could dull their delight.<br />
<br />
Back in Andrew&#39;s room, they sat around and fell into a weird mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;So like... what do we do?&quot; Caleb asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, or in general?&quot; Morgan inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess in general... did you still want to try and fix your body up?&quot; Caleb clarified.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll go back to his room and sort myself out in the morning. But to answer your broader question... I think we just stay positive and try to make it through to the end of our time stuck like this.&quot; Morgan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we don&#39;t even know if they&#39;ll honor their promise!&quot; Caleb said sharply.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; Morgan said, defeated. &quot;But what does it get us to give up? And what would we even do to counter them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we get into the occult voodoo shit like them!&quot; Caleb said, clearly having a eureka moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, that&#39;s a possibility, sure. But they&#39;ve been doing this stuff, well at least Seth has, for years. Maybe he&#39;s known how to do this stuff for a while, but only recently decided it was worth trying? He&#39;s about as close to an expert on this as we are at Smash, dude.&quot; Morgan explained.<br />
<br />
Caleb huffed, sliding down the wall he was leaning against. &quot;This can&#39;t be real. It&#39;s a dream, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan pinched his skinnier leg. A sharp pain proved it was real. &quot;Nope. This is actually happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhh... I guess we should try and get some sleep. Do you want to meet up in the morning for breakfast?&quot; Caleb asked, giving up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Hey, at least you can look forward to me giving a makeover to Seth. I have to see what else he&#39;s got other than marvel t-shirts and baggy cardigans.&quot; Morgan tried to cheer his friend up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess that will mildly amuse me.&quot; Caleb groaned.<br />
<br />
Morgan took off not too long after that, and before long was back in Seth&#39;s room. It seemed he was still alone for the time being, so he indulged his curiosity and removed more clothing than when Caleb was with him. Using the same full length mirror from before, he observed himself as he stripped sweater, shirt, joggers, socks, and finally underwear.<br />
<br />
Before his was a thin, yet soft form. Boyish in many features, though Seth had a strong jaw and serious brow. Like he noticed before, Seth was nearly completely smooth... His own body wasn&#39;t super hairy, but there was definitely a fuzz all over. With Seth&#39;s torso, he ran his smaller hands down, gliding them over smooth skin. He was oily on his face, but he was pretty clear skinned else where. Something Morgan was enjoying quietly was the way his legs no longer rubbed against each other like in his old body. They would get chafed between the thighs. This body however felt like he could spin or flip and he&#39;d have zero discomfort. <br />
<br />
After a while of exploring his body, he cracked open a draw and found some night clothes to toss on. He applied Seth&#39;s medicine and brushed his teeth. While the medicine stung a bit on his angry zits, he was delighted to flick his tongue across teeth that now felt clean as a whistle. In the morning, he was excited to see what a good shower would do for this greasy, oily hair too.<br />
<br />
The last &quot;charming&quot; experience was finding his new penis rising to attention as he slipped under the covers of Seth&#39;s bed. He wasn&#39;t sure about playing around with this body yet, so he allowed himself to descend into a peculiarly restful sleep.</p>
