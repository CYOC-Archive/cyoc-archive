<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had done it. Dustin had destroyed the universe.<br />
<br />
To his credit, it was all Ty&#39;s fault, and if he were able, he&#39;d be able to spot Ty&#39;s battered, screeching form among the pores of his skin, so infintismally small that the sight was indescribable. Ty had wished to be immortal, yes, but the forces acting upon him were traumatic. His ears felt like they would implode, yet they didn&#39;t. His limbs twisted at impossible angles, only it did not damage him, it merely brought him pain. He wasn&#39;t able to wish everything back to normal...not at the moment, anyway. He was a bit...busy.<br />
<br />
So, for now, Dustin looked around with panicked Giraffe eyes. He was surprised to see light once more, something that he hadn&#39;t seen in some time. He was even more surprised to see that, what he could only assume was the edge of...everything, had shattered like a glass marble. However, this was the only solace he would get, as he found that the landscape he found himself on was hard to describe. His eyes had difficulty recieving the information. He saw a long, flat plain, as far as the eye could see, only strange plateaus of static seemed to fade in and out, explosions of color violating every orifice of his being. He could feel the sensation of being peppered with rain, if the rain were thumbtacks, and they were all landing on his eyes. Dustin closed his animalistic, giraffe eyes, hoping for this strange new universe to go away. Only, he found that it didn&#39;t help...a strange new color, which he could swear he had never seen before, was violating his eyes between his eyelids...and he could swear his eyes were bleeding...<br />
<br />
...far, FAR below, Ty finally impacted a single piece of the infinitely black shell that made up the borders to the previous boundary that defined infinity. His mind was still reeling from what he&#39;d done. Of course, the entire universe being destroyed in a single instant ought to hurt, but Ty was having difficulty recovering psychologically. In his haste, he&#39;d forgotten to make himself immune to pain...what a stupid decision. With a moment of clarity, Ty made the wish to be immune to all forms of pain, and with that, his mind cleared, and he breathed a huge, deep sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Yet, he was not out of the woods. Shakily rising to his feet, he only saw a horizon of black, with a sky full of painful visions, cascaded by the sight of his beyond universal brother. The sight of the world before him didn&#39;t hurt to view, thanks to his wish, but what was this madness!? Could they have entered a new universe entirely?! Strange visions seemed to defy all reasoning, and Ty found himself looking down to avoid the sight, only to find himself even more confused. What was this black substance he was standing on? It was hard as a rock, but felt like pudding, and was as slippery as ice. With another quick wish, he realized two things. One: They were indeed in an upper universe, and Two: He was standing on the remains of the border of theirs.<br />
<br />
...oh, god, what had he done!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Ty, Dustin steadily rose to his giraffe feet, and mercilessly kicked the chunk of the universe Ty was standing on out of the way to do so. Ty wasn&#39;t in danger, and more recently, wouldn&#39;t feel pain, but it had interrupted the next wish he was going to make. So did the falling that began shortly afterwards, as Dustin discarded that segment of universe off of a cliff of some sort. Oops.<br />
<br />
Dustin was used to the sight of this &quot;new color&quot; by now, which he could only describe as a cross between green and red, but that didn&#39;t help him in combatting the pain it brought, or the pain he felt in merely existing in this space. As he doubled up in size, he felt the pain increase twentyfold, and screamed out in pain, yet kept his resolve. And finally, he began to walk. Not to make sense of this place, but to find out how to get the hell out of it. It was too much to bare...<br />
<br />
Ty realized after several minutes that this was going to be a long fall. At peace with this thought, it finally occured to him that he didn&#39;t have to be falling in the first place. &quot;I wish I could fly.&quot; Ty was satisfied to feel the weight lifted from his shoulders as he began to hover, the pieces of the former universe falling into the...static, it seemed, below. Looking up, Ty saw only static. Infact, there was only static around him. Either his mind couldn&#39;t handle the sight of this &quot;upper universe&quot;, or it was exactly as hellish as it looked like. Neither option was particularly good to think about.<br />
<br />
So, Ty finally decided to do something about it. Closing his eyes, and breathing in slowly, he began to make a wish, wishing...</p>
