<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn't until Lunch that Susan could make her move. In the meantime, Susan's increased intelligence was making school much easier for her. At the same time, Jen's side-dare kept her interest and enjoyment high, which she knew was thanks to that side-dare. She almost found herself thanking Kyle for it - after all, he had placed no time limit on how long she was to enjoy school.<br />
<br />
As Susan and Jen walked into the lunch hall, they saw Jasmin, sitting in her corner as usual. Smiling, the two girls strolled over to her. Jen didn't want to miss a moment of this, especially since Jasmin should particularly love what was coming. She also knew that it would be easier to convince Jasmin to refrain from choosing if they worked together.<br />
<br />
Susan paused as though she would ask permission to sit, first, but Jen slid straight into a chair and struck up a conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Jasmin.&quot; Susan found herself sliding into place next to Jen, as it would now be awkward to ask permission to sit.<br />
<br />
Jasmin looked up at Jen, then at Susan. Jen noticed the lingering look at Jasmin had given Susan - it made some sense, as Jasmin had implied that she was a lesbian until her inevitable sex change some time after leaving school. Jen knew that the events in action were going to have another interesting side-effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hi, Jen. Susan.&quot; Jasmin turned her attention back to her food. She had been playing with her fork, and seemed to be lacking an appetite. Jen suspected that her transsexual feelings were causing some sort of depression, although Jasmin hadn't said anything about that.<br />
<br />
The girls had decided to ease into the step, and so for a few minutes, they spoke about nothing of any significance. They just needed to get Jasmin's attention, first. Eventually, Jen decided it was time to move ahead with the plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasmin, listen. Have you heard about the town curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmin looked momentarily perplexed, then said &quot;Oh, that dare thing? I've heard a little bit about it, always thought it sounded fake. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see, it's a real thing. Kyle Perkins used it on me, and tried to turn Susan into my penis. We're working to exact revenge, and we thought of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmin was understandably taken aback. &quot;Me? What do I have to do with revenge? I think you have the wrong idea about me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan spoke up. &quot;Jen just chose the wrong words. We have a plan for revenge that should also benefit you. Jasmin, how would you like to get your wish? Become a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmin stared at Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not kidding,&quot; Jen interjected.<br />
<br />
Jasmin stared more, before saying, in a whisper, &quot;What do I have to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don't pick anything when Susan uses the curse on you. Trust us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmin looked at Jen, then back at Susan. &quot;How do I know you aren't going to do something nasty to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was slightly shocked. While she might have been a bit harsh to a few of the guys, like Kyle, she'd never been mean or even rude to Jasmin or any of the other girls. She didn't think anyone would have thought like that about her.<br />
<br />
Susan found, however, that her dare was starting to kick into action. She reached across to Jasmin, and ran her hand gently along her face. Jen could immediately see the effect that Susan's newfound beauty was having on Jasmin, whose hand had already wandered to her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Jasmin, do it for me.&quot; Susan pouted as best she could, and put her other hand over her chest, before letting it shift over to the nipple of one of her now-particularly-shapely breasts.<br />
<br />
Jasmin sighed and nodded. It was all the dare needed to push into the next stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasmin, Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
A minute went by, during which Susan continued to gently stroke Jasmin's face and draw her attention to the ample breasts. Jasmin appeared to be completely enamoured by Susan's body. Jen, meanwhile, was feeling a little like a third wheel.<br />
<br />
Susan spoke up. &quot;You get both. Jasmin, for your dare, you will find Kyle Perkins, and use the curse on him, and ensure that he doesn't answer. When the time limit is up, you will give him the curse I am about to describe to you.<br />
<br />
For his Transform he will, over one hour, become your penis. He basically shrink down and become limbless and be your working penis. He will work just like a penis, so you won't have to worry about injuring him by running. His dare will be that his mind will stay the same but he will also think like a penis would, in fact sometimes his lust will transmit and become your lust, too. Everyone except for you, me, Jen, and Kyle will think this is normal. In fact Kyle will emit a pheromone that will make girls want to have sex with you. Have fun at school.<br />
<br />
&quot;For YOUR Transformation, you will, even as Kyle turns into your penis, find your own body turning into that of an attractive, masculine male.&quot; At this point, Susan decided to ad lib a bit. &quot;In fact, you will become simultaneously the man you feel you should be and my ideal man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen interjected again. &quot;But! We want you to ensure that we get to see the whole thing happen. It needs to happen before the end of school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmin's face brightened up immensely. It was as though a gloom that had hung over her had instantly dissipated, and the entire lunch hall was brighter for her newfound smile. Jen hadn't realised just how beautiful Jasmin really was, until then. It was almost a shame that such feminine beauty would be lost during the transformation.<br />
<br />
Jen had planned quite carefully, as Jasmin shared both of her next two classes with Kyle, and the second one also had Jen and Susan. If all went according to plan, Kyle would be turning into a penis, and Jasmin into a masculine guy, during that second class.<br />
<br />
Which just happened to be Gym. Jen smiled deeply.</p>
