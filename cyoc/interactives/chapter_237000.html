<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It’s practically common knowledge that the introduction of online dating has made the navigation of the world of singles exponentially more difficult. It’s also common knowledge that people eschew the acknowledgement of this fact, continuing to use online dating apps while complaining about how terrible they are at the same time. Brett was no exception to the masses when it came to this behavior, swiping left and right every day, endlessly going nowhere with various guys.<br />
<br />
Today was no different. Brett found himself in the middle of a dry spell. The men who’s profile he liked didn’t like him back, as he was going several days on no matches. Brett did admit to himself that he was the choosier sort when it came to potential matches, but he justified it internally: why match with someone you don’t actually find attractive or want to get to know? It was shitty to be lonely in the meantime, but trying to date without much interest in the other party seemed like a worse option.<br />
<br />
Another set of swipes, and Brett found himself at the end of the queue. It was an occurrence which happened more often than he’d like to admit these days. A line of text appeared on the blank screen, almost mocking him. “Looks like you’ve gone through everyone. Maybe try expanding your horizons?” Sighing, he set down his phone and decided to dedicate his afternoon to other activities around the house: lounging and playing video games.<br />
<br />
It had been a good few hours of kicking back and relaxing when Brett’s phone buzzed with the sound of a notification from the dating app. Had someone actually matched him after days of nothing? Brett was intrigued, but tried to not be too hopeful as he went to pick up his phone. Sure enough, a notification was right on the lock screen: “Check out your new match, Anthony”.<br />
<br />
Brett unlocked his phone and opened the app, navigating to the profile of the man he matched with. The first thing he noticed, strangely, was that there were no photos of his new match. Maybe Anthony had deleted them after Brett had swiped to match? He knew that he wouldn’t ever match with a blank profile on purpose. The age of the profile was also right on the upper limit of what Brett had his acceptable range to: 29. Brett was 23 himself and wasn’t comfortable dating 30somethings just yet.<br />
<br />
After a moment of thought, Brett was ready to just delete the match and move on with his day, but the image of a speech bubble with three dots indicating that Anthony was typing made him stop. There was no point in being rude to someone who was trying to talk to him. Brett waited for his match to send a message, which quickly arrived.<br />
<br />
“Hello! You have a very nice profile. :) How are you today?” the text said. <br />
<br />
Brett replied with a noncommittal “Haha thanks I’m good”, as it was polite to not ignore people, but the blankness of the profile really put him off.<br />
<br />
It was a couple of minutes until he got a reply, and it was a bit of a drawn out one. “Excellent, I’m glad to hear that you’re doing well. It appears that we have quite a bit in common, bud, from looking at your profile. It’s not every day that one finds such a handsome man with suitable interests on this app.”<br />
<br />
Brett smiled at the compliment at least, and replied “Thanks, I can’t see your profile though for some reason?”<br />
<br />
A minute passed while Brett continued to play his game, then he saw his phone light up. “That’s peculiar. It’s entirely visible on my end. It’s likely just the app acting up. Apologies about that!”<br />
<br />
“No need for you to be sorry, not your fault” replied Brett, leaving it at that. This conversation was kind of strange and he wasn’t very interested in committing to someone who’s face he didn’t even know. He turned his phone over and went back to his video game, putting his full attention into that. He played for a couple of hours, and found himself making a lot of headway into the world he had recently unlocked, but found himself booted out of the level spontaneously as he got one-shot by a random meteor fall.<br />
<br />
Disgruntled, and noting that it was getting fairly late anyway, Brett decided to pass the time instead with a favorite pastime of his: looking at softcore porn online. He logged into his blogging website where he looked at photos, and put his hand down his sweatpants as he started scrolling through various blogs. It was an assault on the senses, or at least the sight, scrolling through a practically endless stream of men for his viewing pleasure.<br />
<br />
Except he wasn’t getting much pleasure out of it. Brett didn’t know why, he felt kind of horny, or at least he thought he did, but his cock was practically stuck in a barely-hard state. He kept scrolling, feeling more annoyed than anything that he was having difficulty getting up. What was he, 50? But the hunks on the dashboard and their muscular bodies with big, smooth pecs and clean abs weren’t doing anything for him.<br />
<br />
He scrolled at a faster pace and felt his boner suddenly spring to life in his hand as he stopped on a post. It was of a couple, one hunky man that was Brett’s type to a T, and a taller, older, man holding him from behind, kissing the neck of the hunk with his bearded face. They were both only wearing jockstraps. Brett’s attention wasn’t towards the hunk, though. No, it was the husky man behind him who was the center of his erotic attention.<br />
<br />
Confused, Brett kept stroking, hoping something had sparked in him. He kept scrolling, seeing more of his usual type of men, but found himself quickly getting right back to square one. What the hell was happening? Annoyed and sexually frustrated, he scrolled back up to the handsome couple and started stroking his member. The one photo was proving to be enough as Brett felt a bead of sticky pre leak out of his cock head.<br />
<br />
He played with his cock, looking at the photo and imagining what it would be like to be that man, or that boy, or even just there. His thoughts were racing and inconsistent as he sensually stroked his cock more and more, getting rock hard. Maybe it was the erotic sensation from looking at something different, but his cock was straining much moreso than any usual jerk off session.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before he broke out into heavy breathing and let out a deep moan, feeling euphoric as a load of sticky cum shot right into his underpants. He sat there for a moment in bliss, collecting himself as he removed his softening cock from the wad of jizz in his underwear, his breath returning to normal. He closed the internet browser, and took a heavy sigh.<br />
<br />
That wasn’t normal, by any stretch. Was Brett really that sexually frustrated that now he couldn’t even get off to his normal porn? Maybe he had to quit. He stood up, discarding his clothing and throwing it into the laundry basket after cleaning up a little, and laid in bed. Sleep sounded good right now. He’d wake up and feel normal again. Besides, masturbation always made him tired anyway.<br />
<br />
–<br />
<br />
Brett stretched, feeling himself wake up. Today he actually had classes. He felt strange as he stretched, like his body was a little more stiff than usual. He swung his legs over the side of his bed and sat up, rubbing his eyes.<br />
<br />
It was early, he noticed, looking at the clock. Brett never was a morning person, but he felt surprisingly alert for 6:45 AM in the morning. He didn’t have class until 10:30, so he couldn’t for the life of him figure out why he was awake. Ah well, he figured. If he wasn’t tired, he might as well stay up.<br />
<br />
Brett headed to the bathroom for a regular shower, using the luxury of ample spare time to really bask in the warm water and take care to lather up and clean himself thoroughly. He stepped out, refreshed, and wiped a spot clean on the mirror after he dried off, ready to shave like he did every day. He stopped though, after opening his drawer and catching the reflection of the side of his face. He turned back to himself, leaning into the mirror.<br />
<br />
His stubble looked denser than usual. Like, way denser than usual. Brett found himself wondering if sudden growth spurts could happen at 23, overnight like that. The mirror wouldn’t lie to him. And it looked pretty good, he had to reason. Brett decided that he would rock the stubble, closing the drawer and heading back to his room.<br />
<br />
It was still very early, only shortly after 7. Brett had no idea what to do with himself now. He was practically never up this early, but he had so much energy. Still, the idea of sitting down and playing video games was very appealing to him, as per usual, so he sat down and booted his console up. As he did, his phone buzzed, alerting him he had a new message.<br />
<br />
He reached over to check it. It was a text from Anthony: “Good morning, handsome!”. Brett smiled, the attention was nice even if he still didn’t know much about Anthony. He noticed that the notification seemed to have a picture attached this time, but he couldn’t really make it out.<br />
<br />
Brett slid the notification across and the app opened, right to the message screen. “Hey, morning! How are you?” he replied, trying to keep it nonchalant. He pressed the back button, looking at Anthony’s profile again, seeing that yes, there was a photo now, but it certainly wasn’t what Brett was expecting.<br />
<br />
Anthony looked.. old. He certainly didn’t look 29, and 39 was even being generous. He had a short crop of black hair on his head, with the temples obviously receding, and his stubble was very thick on his face, which showed signs of age through wrinkles and lines. A big beard adorned his cheeks and chin, obscuring his lower face other than around his mouth. He did look happy in his photos, at least, but Brett was surprised to see what he did. He clicked the profile open, and saw it right there:<br />
<br />
“Anthony, 49”<br />
<br />
Confused, Brett put his phone down. He’d never in a million years match with someone over twice his age. What was making him even more uncomfortable though was that he didn’t really want to unmatch – Anthony looked like one of the hot, hairy, daddies that Brett was looking at last night. Mmm, Brett’s thoughts started to wander as his cock started to chub up. He wondered if Anthony would be good at sex.<br />
<br />
Brett shook his head, getting out of his stupor. That was a lot to think about someone he’d only really started talking to last night, even if the man was a DILF. His phone buzzed, and with no self control Brett picked it right back up to see a message from Anthony. It was a long one. A paragraph about how he was having a great morning and was just sitting down with some breakfast, getting ready to do errands soon before sitting down for work.<br />
<br />
Brett replied, actually putting in some effort this time. The two men chatted back and forth about their interests. Anthony liked photography, performance art, and nature. Brett, more of a city guy himself, talked about the gym and video games. Anthony teased him, saying he had the tastes of a typical young gay man, but Brett took it in good stride. He knew that it was in his best interests to expand his horizons a bit – just like the app had suggested to him. Not that he’d ever tell Anthony, but he used that very same logic to justify continuing to talk to him. Anthony was good conversation too, a rarity on the apps.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Anthony said his goodbyes and went to do his errands, leaving Brett in his apartment alone. It was still another hour and some change until lecture, and Brett was bored. He still had no idea what had compelled him to get up so early, yet he wasn’t tired. Maybe he’d head to campus early today, and study for a bit – a habit he didn’t often indulge in.<br />
<br />
The weather was nice on his short walk. Brett lived close to campus, a feat given how exorbitant rent typically was for living close by without several roommates. He had been lucky enough to strike a deal while searching, so that he could live alone for a relatively low price. He wasn’t exactly raking in spare cash, but he was floating, for now.<br />
<br />
Brett sat down in the lobby of the building his class was in and cracked open his computer, logging into the system. His courses were all there, but it seemed to be bloated, somehow. The class he was about to have was pushed over one to the right of its usual button. He paid it no mind, blaming the browser, and opened the online portal to the class content.<br />
<br />
Reviewing the day’s lecture ahead of time seemed to come to Brett in a snap. Usually he had difficulties with this class, but as he whizzed through the content, he found that everything was making sense, clicking together in an intuitive manner. He mused to himself, “This is something I should be doing before every class.”<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the lecture began, and Brett found the content straightforward and engaging. There was some kind of magic in the air, or perhaps the speaker system, as the class content and professor’s speech excited Brett, driving him to pay attention, rather than boring him to tears like usual. He nodded along as the class went on, giving it undivided attention. After a short period the lecture was over. As Brett was packing his things up, the professor called him over.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Andrews.” The professor said, as Brett acknowledged him and approached.<br />
<br />
“Please, just call me Brett.” The student replied, keeping himself more casual.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Brett. Your performance has been stellar in this course so far, and I expect it to continue along this stream.” He praised.<br />
<br />
Brett mulled over it, as clear as everything seemed now, he didn’t remember doing so fantastic on the homework component or some of the interactive quizzes. But hey, a compliment was a compliment. “Thanks, professor. I try my best to learn and reflect.” He said, and he felt like he meant it, at least now.<br />
<br />
“It’s quite apparent. If you keep this performance up, which I have no doubt that you will, I’d like to hire you as a teaching assistant for the upcoming year.” The professor said.<br />
<br />
Brett’s face lit up. “Oh, wow!” he exclaimed, “I’d be glad to help out and do it.”<br />
<br />
“Great. And of course, you’ll be paid too.” Said the professor. “We can chat about the details later. I have another course that I have to teach. Take care, Mr. Andrews.”<br />
<br />
The two walked out separate doors and Brett was stunned. Being a good pupil really was rewarding after all. He found himself back in the atrium, and at a loss of what to do. He felt like he had class or.. something. Instinctively, he checked his phone. There was a message form Anthony.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Hope class went well. I’ve had such a busy morning but it’s all settling down now. What are you up to this afternoon, handsome man?”<br />
<br />
The flirting was forward, and Brett kind of liked it. Still, something was nagging at him. He surely had something to do this afternoon, but he couldn’t remember what for the life of him. Mentally, he shrugged. It couldn’t be that important if he was forgetting it. He just replied to Anthony. “Hey handsome,” It was good to flirt back to show he was interested. “I’m having a great day! About to head home, now that class is over.”<br />
<br />
A reply, practically instantly. “Oh, very nice. It’s nice to get home and get comfortable and relax. Eat something and kick back.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah hahaha. I’m really hungry now that you mention it.” He replied. Quickly, he sent another text after gathering his bearings for the quick commute home. “And you’re right, but it’s better with company haha.”<br />
<br />
“Grr, you got that right.” Anthony replied, flirting with Brett. “It’s always more comfortable with a man by my side.”<br />
<br />
Brett smiled. If Anthony was going to be forward, Brett figured that he could take some initiative too. “We can make that happen, you know.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?”<br />
<br />
“What are you doing tonight?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely nothing.” Typed Brett. “Want to come over?”<br />
<br />
The next reply wasn’t as quick as Anthony took his time typing out a response. “I want to, yes. But I’m not 100% sure if I can or not, yet. Stay tuned, I’ll figure it out as the day goes on.”<br />
<br />
Brett’s heart dropped, a little bit. He was actually disappointed. He thought, as he walked, of course the man who he had been speaking to for less than 24 hours wouldn’t jump at the thought of meeting him right away. That made sense. But still, he’d hoped for something more. His reply pulled back a little. “Alright, let me know!”<br />
<br />
He put his phone on silent and finished the walk home, entering the door and putting his things away. His stomach growled, demanding immediate attention. He gave it a pat and laughed, he hadn’t been this starving in so long. He opened his cupboards. There wasn’t much worth eating in his apartment, unfortunately. He opted to open a can of pasta, heating it in the microwave. It didn’t last very long as he wolfed it down.<br />
<br />
After he finished, his stomach growled once more. It was like he hadn’t even eaten. He rolled his eyes and opened the cupboard, opening two more cans and downing those quickly too. They seemed to satiate him for the time being, as he headed to his room and sat down at his desk.<br />
<br />
He felt warm, he noticed, after sitting down, and it seemed to originate on his belly. He instinctively put his hand under his shirt to feel, and it was practically radiating heat. He moved his hand around to see if it was coming from a spot in particular, but it didn’t seem to be. What he did notice though was that giving himself a belly rub felt.. really good. He continued moving his hand around, feeling the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Brett also noticed that there was something else there. He felt hairy. Brett had never really rubbed his belly before, and hadn’t really spent a lot of time looking in the mirror, but the sensation on his hands was undeniable. He was curious, so he threw off his shirt and chucked it on the floor, and looked down at his body.<br />
<br />
His suspicions were partially confirmed. No one would describe Brett as super hairy, but he certainly had more hair on his chest and around his stomach than he had remembered before. He handwaved the thought, it’s not like he kept tabs on how hairy he was, or anything, but it was quite enjoyable. He kept rubbing his belly, enthusiastically revelling in the feeling as it swelled up, bigger and a little hairier.<br />
<br />
His phone buzzed, in his pocket. Annoyed that he had to stop rubbing his fuzzy belly, Brett took it out. Hadn’t he put it on silent? It was a message from Anthony, though, so he didn’t mind.<br />
<br />
“Hey big boy! I’m unfortunately preoccupied tonight, and can’t get out of it, but how do you feel about coming over tomorrow after work? I work from home most days so you can come whenever you want.”<br />
<br />
It wasn’t 100% the text Brett wanted to see, but it was sufficient. He typed out a reply: “I understand about tonight. I’d love to come over tomorrow, if you’d have me. I really want to meet you.” And it was true. He knew that being this infatuated with a man after such a short period of time was usually a bad sign, but he couldn’t help it. He chuckled aloud, maybe he had some daddy issues to work out.<br />
<br />
It appeared that Anthony was on the same page. “Yes! Please come over! I’m not usually this eager I swear, but I feel very close to you. Like we’re soulmates, or something.”<br />
<br />
Brett grimaced. That wasn’t the word he would use, but after some thought, he understood the sentiment. “Yeah, or something.” He replied. Quickly realizing that his text could be interpreted as rude, he sent a flirty text. “Wish I could cuddle up to you tonight, though.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’d hold you tight and give you soft belly rubs and kisses.” Replied Anthony. Brett’s dick, already semi-erect from rubbing his own belly, rose to attention.<br />
<br />
“I’d like that. I want to get close to you and explore every part of your body.” He replied.<br />
<br />
“Every part? ;)” a quick reply came through.<br />
<br />
Horny, it took Brett not even two seconds to reply. “Every. Part.”<br />
<br />
A notification telling Brett that he got a new photo appeared on the phone, and he eagerly opened it. It was a weird angle, but the picture was of Anthony’s hairy chest and crotch, with a huge boner making a vivid imprint on a jockstrap.<br />
<br />
“WOOF!!” sent Brett, his cock harder than ever before. He sent a far less flattering photo in response, his body not measuring up to the bearishness of Anthony’s, but Anthony didn’t seem to mind, calling him sexy and saying he couldn’t wait to meet up. The next message Anthony sent was a tease.<br />
<br />
“You’ll have to wait until tomorrow to see the real thing! I have to go to bed.”<br />
<br />
To bed? Brett looked at the top of his phone. It was 11:15 PM already!? Where the hell had the time gone over the day? It felt like he just got home from school. Trying to not come across as crazy, he sent a nonchalant reply.<br />
<br />
“Damn haha, well I can be patient. Have a good night Anthony.”<br />
<br />
“Call me Tony. Sweet dreams, Drett.”<br />
<br />
Drett? That was a new one. He supposed that the D and B keys weren’t horribly far apart on a keyboard, but it’s kind of hard to mess up on something like that. He didn’t bother sending a correction, figuring it would make him look like an asshole.<br />
<br />
Brett only had one problem now. He was still horny, and Anthony didn’t seem to want to be coy any more tonight. He logged into his blogging website again and, like many other nights, was met by a wall of silver daddies. He looked at the pictures, focusing on their furry chests and hairy bodies, finding himself get hard all over again.<br />
<br />
He quickly got into a rhythm jerking off, but found himself wishing in the recesses of his mind that he was really with Anthony. He decided to move to his bed, instead, closing the tab and his laptop. He grabbed a tissue and turned out the light, sprawling out on the bed while jerking his cock. Brett shut his eyes as he was bombarded with images of sexy men dancing, teasing him with their furry bodies.<br />
<br />
His fantasies culminated as he pictured Anthony in front of him, standing over him. Brett’s mind focused on that fat cock in the jockstrap, as the mental image of Anthony pulled it out, hard as a rock, and smirked at Brett. “This one’s all for you, my sexy man.”<br />
<br />
Brett growled as the fantasy got even hotter, rubbing his hairy belly as the fantasy Anthony did the same, spreading Brett’s legs. Brett did the same as he laid there, and moaned. “Please, Tony. I need you. I need you!”<br />
<br />
“That’s right, Drett. You’re all mine, and I’m all yours.” His fantasy said to him, as Brett moaned, not noticing the name screw up. The fantasy man made a motion to enter Brett’s waiting hole with his huge cock as Brett came all over his belly and chest. The orgasm was mind-blowing. He had never had something so vivid, but never pictured himself in such a position.<br />
<br />
Brett laid there, in post orgasmic bliss, while running thoughts through his head. He was a top, and certainly not a submissive type, but being spread open and begging for Anthony’s cock just felt so natural. Even if it didn’t sit right in his head for some reason. It was confusing, and he had to sleep.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the tissue and wiped up the cum all over him, not noticing as his belly and chest filled out more as he spread cum that he couldn’t catch onto his skin. It was certainly too dark to see more hairs grow where he wiped over, and he was too exhausted to feel it. He threw the dirty tissue in the waiting garbage can, and Drett promptly fell asleep.<br />
<br />
–<br />
<br />
Morning, again. Drett woke up to his alarm clock blaring. 6:45 AM, just like every other day. Drett got up and stretched, heading over to the bathroom to shower. His movements felt large and sluggish, but he wrote it off as morning weariness as he turned on the water and got in after it warmed.<br />
<br />
He let the water rain over him, and reached for the shampoo, lathering it in his hands before reaching for his head to clean his hair. When he made contact with his head though, he recoiled, pulling his hands away. Drett was never the type of man who took enormous care of his locks, but he knew that his hair had been longer than this yesterday. Or, at least he figured he did. Hair didn’t cut itself, after all. Maybe he dreamed it? Drett did feel sluggish even now in the shower, so he wondered if he had experienced a particularly vivid dream and considered it real.<br />
<br />
He tried to shoo away the discomfort by just going and washing his hair anyway, and then his face after. He grabbed the loofah he kept in the shower and lathered it with body wash, putting it to work on his body. As he vigorously washed himself, circles all over his arms and chest, he felt his dick rise to attention.<br />
<br />
“Sheesh!” Drett said to himself, “You’d think I was a kid again or something, my libido like that.” It had been a while since he’d gotten a random boner, and here it was sprung to attention. Maybe he was just excited about his date tonight.<br />
<br />
He stepped out, and went to the sink, brushing his teeth to start the day. After rinsing and spitting, Drett grinned with his mouth open and looked at his reflection. He closed his mouth, and started making faces. He was getting really fuzzy, after not shaving, but it looked good, he had to admit. His facial hair was at that middle length between stubble and a beard, and in the light it looked quite bright. Drett winked at himself as he headed to his room to get dressed.<br />
<br />
The rest of the morning was uneventful, as he ate breakfast and put on the TV, flipping between channels. Like yesterday, he texted Anthony, who was quite flirty with Drett, saying he couldn’t wait to have him over. Drett found himself quickly getting horny again, and his messages didn’t even make a slight attempt to hide it.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait until my lips are pressed right against yours, making out all night long” It was maybe a bit cornier, and on the tame side, but the sentiment was 100% real from Drett.<br />
<br />
“Aww, that’s so sweet. I bet our beards pressed together will feel really good” replied Anthony, followed by “Can you send a pic?”<br />
<br />
Drett clicked the camera button and enabled the front-facing camera, smiling and sending a picture to Anthony. It wasn’t great, but he looked alright.<br />
<br />
“WOOOF!!!” the reply came immediately through. Drett’s heart fluttered at Anthony’s excitement. “God, you’re such a handsome man. And so hairy! I love husky guys like you.”<br />
<br />
Anthony surely was exaggerating, Drett thought. “I’m not that hairy lol” he sent.<br />
<br />
“Did you see the pic you took? Your beard is so thick, and I can see your pelt poking out of that shirt you’re wearing. It looks amazing” replied Anthony.<br />
<br />
Thinking that his leg was being pulled, Drett scrolled up and opened his picture. It turned out that no, Anthony wasn’t making anything up. His beard looked thicker than it did in the mirror this morning – no one would ever describe it as stubbly at this point, and there were some hairs poking out of his collar. Many of them, actually.<br />
<br />
“Unbelievable..” muttered Drett, bringing his hand to his face. His fingers were met with luxurious hairs, clean and comfortable to the touch. His cock stirred again, thinking about how Anthony loved it so much. And how could he not? A man’s beard was his pride and joy, and Drett figured he ought to feel attractive with it. The chest hair was just a little extra masculinity on display.<br />
<br />
Drett realized it had been a few minutes since Anthony sent him that compliment on how husky he was and quickly drafted a response. “Thanks handsome. We’d make a hot couple.” Forward, again, but Drett thought about it. Him and Anthony, two hairy, husky hunks, getting comfortable with each other’s bodies. His cock strained against his khakis. God, why was his libido through the roof today?<br />
<br />
“I have to agree, Dett. Can’t wait to see you this evening. I have to get some work done now though, so I’ll text you in a bit, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Alright, have a good time at work. I’m going to go to campus now.” Replied Dett. He put his phone down and started gathering his belongings to put in his backpack. Anthony didn’t reply, but that was okay. When he said he had to work, he meant it. Dett appreciate that. It showed maturity.<br />
<br />
–<br />
<br />
Dett arrived on campus, opting to head to the library for the morning. He entered the building’s lobby and saw a classmate from a group project from his freshman year. He couldn’t remember her name for the life of him, and figured that it would be easier to just avoid her.. But that hope was shattered quickly as she called out a name. “Brett! Hey!”<br />
<br />
Dett figured she was talking to him? Apparently she couldn’t remember his name either, but it was close enough, he guessed. He waved and made his way over to her.<br />
<br />
“Wow, it’s been a while, huh?” she stated, half to herself and half to him. “I know it’s only been a couple of years since we did took econ lit but you really grew up. You look like a man now!” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
He chuckled. “Feels like a lot longer than a couple of years. Time flies, I guess.”<br />
<br />
The girl, who’s name Dett couldn’t remember for the life of him, talked mostly about herself, not leaving much room for Dett to interject to talk about his own life, or classes, or much of anything really. Dett felt two things: one, awkwardness, and two, a reminder of how terrible group projects were in huge classes with random students. He was glad that was long behind him now. Something in the back of his head told him that it wasn’t too far behind him, but he handwaved the thought, opting for relief instead.<br />
<br />
It took a librarian noticing the yapping girl to tell the pair to hush, much to Dett’s relief. The girl apologized, loudly, ironically enough, and said she had to run off. Dett watched her go, and the librarian let out a soft chuckle. “Kids these days, eh?” she said.<br />
<br />
“Heh.. yeah.” Dett awkwardly let out. How old did this librarian think he was? It was obvious that he was older than his peer, but he couldn’t be old enough to categorize her as a “kid”, right? As he wandered into the depths of the library to find a seat, he tried to get it off his mind. Just a strange comment on a strange day.<br />
<br />
Finding a spot was easy enough. Dett sat down at a table against a wall and plugged his laptop in, booting it up and accessing the school’s e-learning portal. He logged in and frowned as he was met with only one course out of his usual set. He saw the heading – Role: Teaching Assistant.<br />
<br />
His thoughts spun in his head as Dett tried to recall the class. It had been a while since he had been in a lecture, but he knew the topic so well. Maybe he’d have to ask the professor where they were in the semester. He couldn’t quite remember, well, much of anything, if Dett was being honest with himself. Why was he here, exactly. He didn’t have work to do, he thought, but he knew that he had to be on campus, for some reason.<br />
<br />
Well, there was always wasting time online, Dett figured. He pulled out his phone and sent Anthony a message: “Hey, how’s work going?”, but was a little annoyed at the lack of instant reply. Dett knew that Anthony was working, and that that was important, but he felt bored. Every minute he sat there felt like a week, as he perused social media and the news, not truly finding any interest in it but scrolling for its own sake.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his phone buzzed. It felt like ages, but in reality had been maybe about 20 minutes. Anthony had left a kind reply. “Hi handsome! I’m having a good day. Not the most demanding workday, which is nice for a change.”<br />
<br />
Dett didn’t care if it broke social norms to reply immediately after a 20 minute wait – he needed conversation now. He typed out. “Oh, great! I’m just fiddling around on campus myself, very bored with nothing to do.”<br />
<br />
Anthony’s reply was quick this time. “Well, that sounds like “after work” to me. Why don’t you come over, like we talked about? I’d love to have you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’ll be right on my way!” replied Dett as he put his laptop back in his bag and found himself quickly walking out of the library, nodding to the librarian on the way out, who returned a smile and wished Mr. Andrewson a good day. Dett was in a good mood as he walked out to the parking lot and suddenly stopped, wondering why he was there, as a pedestrian commuter.<br />
<br />
It seemed obvious to his brain that there was no way he was going to be able to just walk to Anthony’s place, even if he couldn’t off the top of his head remember where Anthony’s place actually was. He knew it wasn’t walking distance though, but why was he here? He could take public transit. Instinctively, Dett pulled his house key out of his pocket and brandished a set of keys on a ring, a large fob on them. He clicked the unlock button and saw a vehicle’s lights illuminate.<br />
<br />
He approached the source of the lights and gazed in awe, looking at the new Sedan. Dett was a student, how could he afford something so nice? The question was huge, but it didn’t seem important as Dett used his keys to let himself into the vehicle, looking at the parking pass hanging from the rear-view mirror with his name on it: Dett Andrewson. As he turned the ignition, the car roaring to life, Dett’s muscle memory pulled him out of the parking lot and onto the city streets.<br />
<br />
Despite having no clear memory of driving in the works of downtown before, Dett navigated the traffic and tight routes effortlessly, as if it were something he’d done every day. His thoughts were entirely focused on the road as he made his way out of the downtown core and onto a highway. Dett lost track of what was going on, so hyperfocused on the immediate situation at hand, and came back to reality as he was pulling into a driveway in a nice neighborhood.<br />
<br />
A strange sensation came over Dett as he realized he was at Anthony’s house. Somehow he knew this, but he also knew he’d never been here before. The three story building though was quite nice – Anthony had to be making some serious money to live in a place like this. Dett looked over at the car dash. It was 4:25 PM. How had it gotten that late? He knew that the drive was only half an hour, but couldn’t for the life of him place the lost time. It didn’t matter, he decided, as he stepped out of the vehicle, locking it with his fob.<br />
<br />
Dett approached the building and knocked at the door. It was less than a minute elapsed until Anthony appeared, opening it and beckoning Dett to come in. Dett entered and took his shoes off, putting them on the shoe rack. Anthony then embraced him in a big bear hug. It felt nice, and comfortable. Just what he needed after such a boring day. “I’m so glad to meet you.” Dett said, hugging Anthony back.<br />
<br />
Anthony chuckled as he released Dett. “Me too. Come in, come in! Can I get you anything to drink?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, no. I’m good, thank you.” Replied Dett.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? Not a cold beer after a hard day? I have plenty to share.” Said Anthony.<br />
<br />
Dett didn’t drink a lot, but after the past couple of days being so tiring, nothing in the world sounded more appealing. He still wanted to be polite, though. “Well, only if you’re sure it’s not a bother or anything.”<br />
<br />
“Of course not, let’s go!” exclaimed Anthony, as he led his guest upstairs. Dett took a look at the rooms he was pulled through. Anthony had good taste in décor. Nothing was super flashy, but it was also quite put together – subtle enough to show a sense of style without being in your face about it. Dett liked it quite a lot.<br />
<br />
Anthony pulled Dett into the kitchen and grabbed a beer out of the refrigerator, taking the cap off and handing it over to his guest. Dett grabbed the bottle, thanked Anthony, and made quick work of the top of the bottle. He let a small burp out and his cheeks flushed red. “Sorry, I guess I was super thirsty!” he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, help yourself to as much as you like.” Replied Anthony. The two men sat at the table and started conversing, though it was Anthony who led the conversation, talking about the most recent musical he went to see, the birds he’d recently seen on his nature walk, and how he couldn’t wait for the season to turn to get a chance at seeing new wildlife and wearing different fashion. Dett was enamored in the conversation. Anthony truly was passionate about his interests, and it was contagious. Dett found himself asking many questions and getting involved in the conversation, as the beer kept flowing.<br />
<br />
Anthony was talking about one of his favorite romantic musicals after Dett’s fourth or fifth beer. He stood up and approached Dett, as Dett turned in his chair to face his date. “It’s just so adorable, how the main character leans in,” he started, pulling his hand closer to Dett’s face and rubbing his beard, “and goes right for the kiss.” Dett closed his eyes as he felt Anthony press his lips against Dett. His boner sprung to life as he reciprocated the kiss, going for some heavy tongue action quickly.<br />
<br />
“What do you say, Delt?” asked Anthony. “Do you want to find out more about their romance?”<br />
<br />
Dett put his hand against Anthony’s pectoral, giving it a squeeze. “God, do I ever.” He said. His world was a bit woozy, and he forwardly stated after. “That’s not my name though.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, apologies. What was it again?”<br />
<br />
He didn’t even notice that Anthony had to ask, as he volunteered forward “Dalt.”<br />
<br />
“Dalt, what a beautiful name.” Anthony said, making Dalt blush. “Let’s get over to the couch.”<br />
<br />
Anthony helped Dalt, who was pretty drunk, get up, and laid him down on the couch. “Here, I’ll help you.” He said, as he got Dalt to lift up his arms, and he removed his shirt. Dalt looked at Anthony after he did so, seeing a wide grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“You’re gorgeous.” Anthony said, quickly stripping his own shirt off, exposing his thick silver pelt of chest hair. He laid on the sofa right next to Dalt, and resumed the kiss in full force, their bodies pressing against each other. As Dalt’s fur made contact with Anthony’s, the color drained from the follicles, becoming silver, just like his kissing partner’s. The color change rippled throughout his body as his arm, leg, pubic, and facial hair all turned to various shades of silver and white. Dalt was far too enrapt in the drunk ecstasy of making out with Anthony to ever notice such a change though.<br />
<br />
Anthony broke the kiss. “How about we just cuddle for a bit, big bear?”<br />
<br />
Dalt wanted to keep making out, but he was a host in Anthony’s domain, so he decided to go with it. “Sure. I could make out with you until the end of all time, but I like just being wrapped up with you too.”<br />
<br />
Anthony let out a small “Grr!” and went for a quick peck. He pulled the TV remote down from the top of the sofa, and turned on the TV. There was a cooking show on.<br />
<br />
The pair watched the show, making idle contact with their hands on each other’s hairy chests and torsos, as they made small talk. As the TV show talked about all sorts of different foods, Anthony talked about how he loved to cook, and Dalt found himself hungry, wanting to eat everything that the TV and the man he was cuddled up with were talking about. He felt Anthony focus his attention on his belly, starting to rub it.<br />
<br />
Dalt let out a moan as Anthony rubbed his fuzzy navel, his gut extending outwards with every back-and-forth. Dalt wasn’t getting fat, per se, at least not to a level of obesity, but no one would ever say that he was a light eater just by looking at him. He was growing thick, which made him feel powerful. Soon, he had rolled over and forced himself right back on Anthony, who was reciprocating a lustful makeout session with joy, the TV all but forgotten about.<br />
<br />
The rest of the evening was a drunken blur, as Dalt and Anthony enjoyed each other’s company, exploring each other’s bodies and making their way up to Anthony’s bedroom after Dalt enjoyed a few more refreshing beers. Dalt was having the time of his life, rapt up in horny energy with a man who knew how to utilize it perfectly. He found himself wishing that it would never end, after a blissful time, as he and Anthony fell asleep, wrapped in each other’s burly arms.<br />
<br />
–<br />
<br />
Dalt yawned as he came to. He was laying in Anthony’s bed, clad in only a paid of plaid pyjama pants. Had he stayed the night? Crap. He had to work today, and had let lust get in the way of responsibly doing so. A savory aroma began to fill the air, and Dalt’s stomach growled. Anthony must’ve been making breakfast, how sweet.<br />
<br />
Throwing on a shirt that was sitting on the dresser and kicking his feet into a pair of slippers by the bed side, Dalt left the room and headed downstairs. He was extremely shocked when he came into a room with three children sitting around the table, eating plates of pancakes and bacon. There were two older teens, a boy and a girl who were in late high school if Dalt had to guess, and one younger boy who looked to be in middle school. They barely paid him any mind, the older boy giving him a head nod, which Dalt reciprocated.<br />
<br />
“Dalt!” called a familiar voice from the kitchen. “I just finished making breakfast! I was wondering when you were getting up. It’s not like you to run late, but it happens to everyone once in a while. Figured I’d let you get a bit of shuteye.”<br />
<br />
“Um, yeah.” Replied Dalt, as a large plate of bacon and pancakes was thrust into his hands. “Can we talk, for a minute?”<br />
<br />
“Sure!” exclaimed Tony, “Just let me turn the stove off.” He said, turning the dial, and following Dalt as he walked far down the hall, out of ear’s reach of the children.<br />
<br />
Dalt got straight to the point. “So, when were you going to tell me that you have children?” he asked.<br />
<br />
Tony raised an eyebrow. “What are you talking about? It’s right on my profile. Look right on your phone.”<br />
<br />
Dalt grumbled, because he didn’t have his phone on his person. He was wearing his pyjamas right now and left it in the bedroom. Tony obliged and opened up his own phone, pointing to his biography where it said “Proud papa bear of three teens!” Dalt jogged his memory. He knew he’d read that before, but it seemed new to him nonetheless.<br />
<br />
“How drunk did you get last night, big man?” asked Tony, giving Dalt’s belly a bit of a rub. It felt good. “You’ve met the kids countless times, now.”<br />
<br />
Dalt was about to object, but he knew Tony was right. The twins, Jessica (who was older by 8 minutes) and Bryce were in their eleventh year of public school. Jessica was passionate about engineering, while Bryce was the more artistic sort. Tony’s younger boy, Tyson, was more athletic on the other hand. He knew their favorite and least favorite foods, birthdays, and many other random trivia facts about them.<br />
<br />
Dalt spoke up with only one sentence instead. “I’m out of it today.”<br />
<br />
“You’ll be alright, hon. You should go to work. Come back over tonight, okay?” Replied Tony.<br />
<br />
That sounded like a good idea. Dalt nodded an affirmative, as he went back upstairs to the bedroom. He opened up the dresser and pulled out a pair of dress pants, and a button up shirt. He looked at himself in the mirror afterwards, and smiled. Dressing nice already made him feel better. Dalt headed back downstairs, and said a round of goodbyes before heading down the second flight to the door, where he put on his loafers and left Tony’s house.<br />
<br />
Dalt was more alert for his ride to school today. He turned on the radio and put on some classic rock, singing along to tunes as he took the highway to the city and drove right to the same parking lot as yesterday, parking in the same exact spot. He grabbed his briefcase from the passenger seat and momentarily cursed himself for leaving it out overnight – Tony’s neighborhood was safe but it was still an unwise decision to leave valuables right out there in the open.<br />
<br />
Today he was supposed to do some teaching assistant duties.. or something like that, Dalt thought. He headed to where the lecture was hosted, where he spoke with the professor on Monday, and found himself in an empty room. Odd, Dalt thought, as a familiar face entered the room.<br />
<br />
“Dale!” he exclaimed, it was the professor he was working for. “I’m glad I could make it here. How have you been adjusting to teaching?”<br />
<br />
“Huh?” asked Dale, confused.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry, I know it’s abrupt. But since you’re new at the college, and taking over the course I usually instruct, I wanted to know how you’re holding up. Students can be so difficult. Then again, you’d know that, you were an undergraduate once too.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right.” Replied Dale. He tried to think of the class, several faces coming to mind, along with lesson plans and other details. He spat an answer out, quickly firing off what came to mind. “This isn’t my first foray into teaching, but I like the students here. They’re mostly committed, I’ve found.”<br />
<br />
“Good, I’m glad to hear that. Sometimes we get good years, other times not so much. The department chair was actually asking for feedback, but for some odd reason wants me to go around and ask. I’m off to a meeting, but I will see you in tomorrow’s faculty meeting! Take care, Dale!” the tenured professor said before heading off.<br />
<br />
How strange, Dale thought, as he set up his laptop for streaming to the screen. As students started entering the room, Dale logged into the portal and saw the course he was teaching, under the header Instructor. He booted up the powerpoint of the day, and engaged in some idle chatter with some students before lecturing.<br />
<br />
The lecture was standard. Dale knew the subject like the back of his hand, but he always got a kick out of teaching. Educating the young was something he was very passionate about. He felt much more natural and less sluggish as the day went on, and by the end of the lecture period was fully into the day, forgetting about how rough the morning was.<br />
<br />
One student approached him after the lecture as he was putting his materials away. “Hi Dr. Henderson. You’re probably going to get an email about this later, but many of us have another midterm the same day as yours from the schedule we received for core department classes. It’s only the beginning of the semester, but we know this is going to be a problem ahead of time and were wondering about getting it moved.”<br />
<br />
Dale chuckled. “Sorry about that. I’m new to the department, so I didn’t know about the dates overlapping. We have a staff meeting tomorrow, actually, so I’ll bring it up there and report back next class.”<br />
<br />
The student thanked Dale and was off to his next class. Dale, himself, was done for the day. He whistled a tune to himself as he headed back to his car. He didn’t have his office set up yet, so he was still doing some work from home for the time being. More time to be with his husband.<br />
<br />
His.. husband. Tony. Hm.<br />
<br />
Dale found himself on autopilot yet again as he walked to the car, completely emotionlessly, and sat in it. It was like his brain was in overdrive, completely unable to process everything. After what felt like eternity, he put the keys in the ignition and drove directly to Tony’s house, entering the building without bothering to knock this time.<br />
<br />
The twins were already home from school. Dale didn’t care about what time it was, even though it felt earlier than it was. He went straight to the bedroom and coughed to get Tony’s attention.<br />
<br />
“Dale!” Tony exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Hey hon. I uh, wanted to talk.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, you can always talk to me.” Said Tony, coming in for a hug, but Dale pushed him away.<br />
<br />
“Something feels really off. About you. About us. About.. me, I guess. Why can’t I shake the feeling that we’re not supposed to be married? Like this isn’t normal?” asked Dale. “It keeps coming and going and racking my brain.”<br />
<br />
“I suppose things are moving quickly. You haven’t quite had time to catch up.”<br />
<br />
“Catch up?” asked Dale.<br />
<br />
“Well, yes. The dating app we were on. Didn’t it prompt you to expand your horizons?”<br />
<br />
“I uh. Huh. Wha.” Stammered Dale, confused. “The dating app.. it caused this?”<br />
<br />
“Well, yes. More or less. It’s not like I purposefully went out to make it exactly like this, but who you are, hell, who we are is because of the app.” Replied Tony, matter-of-factly.<br />
<br />
Dale’s brain hurt. It was starting to come back to him, sort of. He was a student? But his memories of working up to teaching were so concrete. He could remember years in an office, but also studying hours upon end, or going to parties, but it didn’t overlap at all. The expression on his face made it obvious to Tony that he couldn’t make left or right of the situation.<br />
<br />
“But, it took my life. This wasn’t who I was, even though it’s who I am..” said Dale. “It doesn’t make any sense, but it’s not normal. This isn’t right.”<br />
<br />
“You didn’t even know. If you wanted to go back to normal, as you call it, all you ever had to do at any point in time was unmatch.”<br />
<br />
Dale was floored. All of this could’ve been avoided? He wanted to be mad. Furious, even. But just one look at Tony made him feel super conflicted. It wasn’t like he was gloating or anything. And he never gave Dale a reason to unmatch. Until now, when he knew his life was stolen from him! Sort of. He spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what to think. I’m mad, actually. Did you ever think about stealing my life?” It was raw, unfiltered speech.<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Replied Tony, coolly. “It was something I considered a lot, over and over and over again, changing my mind. But the more I knew about you, the more I realized that you were living a pretty miserable existence. Did you like being single and aimless?”<br />
<br />
“Single and aimless?” asked Dale, his voice raising. “Sure, I didn’t like being single, and I didn’t really do much about it, but to look into a small portion of my life and declare that I’m aimless? It’s like you don’t know anything about me!” It hurt to admit. Tony was supposed to be the person that he was closest to – wait, no! That wasn’t a real thought.<br />
<br />
Tony interrupted his stream of thought. “You’re being ridiculous, I know everything about you. We’re married, and have kids together!”<br />
<br />
“They.. you’re gaslighting me.” Said Dale, but he didn’t really believe it. “Not my kids.”<br />
<br />
“You’re being ridiculous. I remember you used to not want kids at all, but then did a 180 on it.”<br />
<br />
“It’s true, I didn’t want kids..” he said, jogging his memory. “Not while I was young and.. before I met you! On the app!”<br />
<br />
Tony sighed. “We’re going to get nowhere with this, I don’t think.”<br />
<br />
Dale nodded, pulling his phone out of his pocket. “You’re right, I just have to unmatch you, and then I can be free. Your arrogance was your own demise, asshole!” He launched the app in his sudden moment of clarity.<br />
<br />
Tony stepped closer to Dale and put his hand on Dale’s shoulder. “You really want to leave me?” he said, sadness in his voice, as he started to rub Dale.<br />
<br />
Dale had to admit, the shoulder rub felt good. He paused and looked at Tony. His upset face, his handsome, gorgeous, face, in a frown quite visible through that beautiful silver beard. Why would he deliberately upset his husband? Or this man, who wasn’t his husband? Right, not his husband. He looked at his phone, seeing the dating app. The ring on his finger gleamed in the light above for a moment.<br />
<br />
Why the hell did he have a dating app? Something was wrong. And he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was related to the man rubbing his shoulder so tenderly. Thinking about it didn’t feel right though. “…Tony?” he asked, fear in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Something’s wrong, isn’t it.” The big bear replied. Dale just nodded. “It’s about that app, isn’t it.”<br />
<br />
The app! That was it. Something about a match, and Tony, and.. being manipulated? Being single? Being different? Those were clearly insane answers though. “Yeah, the app. It’s not right.”<br />
<br />
“Here hon, give me your phone. I can take care of it.” Tony said, removing his hand and turning to face Dale directly. Dale nodded and handed over the phone.<br />
<br />
Tony smiled. “Thanks hon, I’ll fix you right up. Just let me get in here and go into settings.. There we go. If I deactivate your profile it’ll lock everything in, making you my handsome husband forever. How do you feel about that, Brett?”<br />
<br />
For the first time, there was a sinister tone in Tony’s voice, as everything came back rushing to Brett’s brain. He wasn’t Dale, he was a single young adult, not this bearish man, married with children! He was tricked! Deceived! And it was all this horrible man’s fault. He started to shout, but the tap of Tony’s finger on the screen silenced his voice, as he stood there, eyes glazed over.<br />
<br />
–<br />
<br />
Brett came to his senses. He was in some room? The details were kind of fuzzy, he couldn’t make out any walls or anything, just an endless floor. He started to walk around, and heard footsteps. He turned around, quickly, and saw another man. Brett squinted, scrutinizing him. He looked.. familiar. He spoke up after a minute. “Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“My name is Dale. Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“I’m Brett.” Brett replied.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never met a Brett.” Replied the other man.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, me neither.” Said Brett. He was trying to make conversation, but felt awkward, though he couldn’t place why.<br />
<br />
He paused again, looking at Dale. He was so big. Tall and thick, and.. hairy. He exuded masculine energy. He felt weak in comparison. Small, skinny, smooth. He didn’t like it.<br />
<br />
“You’re naked.” Dale said, pointing it out.<br />
<br />
He was suddenly very aware of how he wasn’t wearing any clothing. He put his hands over his dick, feeling full of shame.<br />
<br />
The big man laughed. “It’s okay, I am too.” It was true. As soon as he said it, Brett’s eyes darted right to Dale’s cock. It was large, with big balls in a hairy sack hanging low underneath. It looked familiar, somehow. But Brett was sure he’d never seen this man in his life.<br />
<br />
His words flowed without a filter. “Your cock reminds me of something. I know that cock.”<br />
<br />
Dale smirked. “I would hope so!” Then pointed at Brett’s crotch. Brett looked down, seeing a hefty cock and big, drooping ballsack. He took his left hand and grasped his member. Had his hand always been that big? It was a question that didn’t matter as his cock grew hard and warm in his hand. It felt good.<br />
<br />
“Dale?” he asked, looking back up, seeing the other man similarly fondling his penis. He was so.. confused. It was just him and this man in this empty, endless, room, and he was so horny. He thought he should be afraid or.. something. But he wasn’t.<br />
<br />
Dale ignored Brett’s question. “You’re so hairy, man.” He said, looking over Brett. “It’s fucking hot. You’re fucking hot.”<br />
<br />
The compliments made Brett’s dick twitch. He looked down at his cock again. There was so much pubic hair, and it was light. Even his wrist was hairy. He looked at Dale, again, the hairy man standing there playing with his cock. He was really hot.. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, and was interrupted by a sudden sensation as he felt his nipple pinched. He let out a light moan, surprising himself.<br />
<br />
Brett opened his eyes to see Dale tweaking his nipples with the hand that wasn’t wrapped around his giant cock. Focusing on his pectorals, Brett started to appreciate how the big bear had such masculine, virile, features, huge nipples sticking out through his fuzzy, silver pelt. Still horny, he felt himself rubbing his own chest, fluffing up the hairs that were there. “Daddy..” he said, feeling a deep longing for the man in front of him.<br />
<br />
Dale chuckled. “That’s me, daddy Dale. Don’t you think I’m sexy?”<br />
<br />
Brett just nodded, mesmerized, basking in the man in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you think I’m an ideal man? A big, husky, bear?”<br />
<br />
Brett nodded, his cock getting harder as Dale’s seductive voice roped him in.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want to be just like me?” Dale asked.<br />
<br />
In truth, Brett wanted nothing more. The perfect man was right in front of him. “Yes daddy..” he said, his tone as if he was in a trance.<br />
<br />
Dale smiled at Brett. It was sincere this time, and it captivated the younger man. This had to be some sort of destiny, Brett thought. It was just him, and this other man in this endless room. He had to know the truth. He asked, again, this time rubbing his hard cock with one hand and teasing his nipple through a fuzzy chest in the other.<br />
<br />
“Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“I’m you.”<br />
<br />
Those two words were enough to send him over the edge as he lost control and his cock erupted, sending shot after shot of cum forward in the best orgasm he’d ever had. He was seeing stars, this was unlike any feeling he’d ever had before. Pure, animalistic, bliss had gripped his mind, and nothing was more important than basking in that feeling. His heart was racing as his energy was focused on sexual gratification.<br />
<br />
He stopped to catch his breath, seeing the bear across from him do the same. There was something between him and the other man. Something.. floating? It was white and looked to be almost dripping down in midair. He approached, watching the other man do the same thing, and got close to it. Kneeling down, as his companion did, he reached out to poke it.<br />
<br />
Other than his hand feeling wet, he felt his hand touching a solid surface, as the other man’s finger stopped just short of making contact. The fluid he had made contact with was undeniably his own jizz. Gross! He looked up, and made eye contact with the bear in the mirror. He saw the man smirk at him, and felt his mouth doing the same thing, his thoughts spiraling into what a nasty bear he was, cumming all over that mirror.<br />
<br />
Mirror. It was a mirror. The bear in the mirror was him. That sexy fucking silver daddy with a huge cock. He rose, watching his reflection do the same, and struck a pose, his silver fur on display and cock quickly rising to attention again. The smirk on his bearded face was a giveaway that he knew how fucking sexy he was.<br />
<br />
“Woof.” Dale said, admiring his hot reflection as the room started to dim.<br />
<br />
–<br />
<br />
Dale Henderson felt a weight pressed into his hands. He looked down, and it was a cell phone. His cell phone, of course.<br />
<br />
“I deleted that stupid app that was causing you trouble. You shouldn’t just download things willy nilly, you know.” His husband Tony said.<br />
<br />
“Spare me the lecture, old man.” Dale said, ribbing his husband.<br />
<br />
“I’m only one year older than you, and I think I heard one of the neighbours calling you a DILF recently.” Replied Tony. “You have no grounds here!”<br />
<br />
Dale laughed. “Well, whoever said that, they’re right. Just look at me! I’m a stud.” He struck a pose as his husband laughed.<br />
<br />
“Well, I can’t deny that. I’d jump you right now if I could. But let’s wait until tonight, after the kids are asleep.” Said Tony. “In the meantime, I can do this.”<br />
<br />
Tony leaned in towards Dale, and Dale reciprocated, closing his eyes. The two men went in for a long, sensual, kiss, their beards interlocking. Dale felt a sharp pinch to his nipple and broke the kiss. “You fucking pig.” He whispered in a low growl, cupping Tony’s crotch.<br />
<br />
“You call me a pig, but you’ll be the one squealing when I breed you tonight, stud.” Replied Tony in a guttural tone, aggressively flirting. Fuck, Dave loved that. Tony’s tone suddenly changed though. “Buuut, you’ll have to be patient. I have to pick up Tyson from hockey practice. Can you start dinner? Get Jessica and Bryce to help if you can.”<br />
<br />
Dave loved that too. Tony really was the best of both worlds. A passionate lover and a family man. “Of course, hon.” He said. “I’ll see you when you guys get back, and we’ll have a family dinner.” He leaned in as Tony gave him a quick kiss before heading out to pick up their oldest son.<br />
<br />
Hmm, family dinner. It was something they always did, but to Dale it felt special today. He couldn’t place his finger on exactly why, but it didn’t matter. He had the perfect family, and he would treasure it as much as he could.</p>
