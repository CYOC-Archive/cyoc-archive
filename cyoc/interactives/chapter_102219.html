<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I am no gonna lie.  I have always been jealous of your dick, and I have always wanted one for myself.  Her goes nothing, &quot; said Amy, as she pointed the flashlight at her groin.  A bright blue light shined on her undergarments.  She moaned, as a small bulge began to form.  It rapidly created a tent under her skirt until it lifted, revealing an enormous cock.  She shut off the light and began to stroke it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl, I thought you were kidding, but this is fucking awesome!  This feels even better than  I thought it would.  Here, it&#39;s your turn Sarah, &quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
Sarah blushed.  &quot;No, I think I&#39;m fine the way I  am.  I don&#39;t want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, Sarah.  Just try it.  If you don&#39;t like it, you can always just switch back later. And it feels really good, &quot; said Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t be such a pussy, &quot; said Amy with a wry smile.  She pointed the device at Sarah&#39;s groin and pressed the button.  Sarah looked in shock as a small bulge formed in her pants.  She closed her eyes and began to bite her lip a little, enjoying the pleasure as her clit grew into a small dick.  Amy shut off the light, leaving her with a small three inch cock.  Sarah opened her eyes, disappointed that her pleasure had ended so soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me that, &quot; said Sarah, as she grabbed the flashlight away from Amy aggressively.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you might like that,&quot; said Amy, as she smiled and leaned back to watch the show.  <br />
<br />
Sarah shined the light on her crotch, moaning as it continued to grow.  She used her free hand to massage her breast. Amy and Stacy were surprised at how large the timid girl was allowing her dick to grow.  When it got larger than Amy&#39;s, she got a little jealous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me that! You have had it long enough, &quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; said Sarah.  &quot;I want it to be even bigger.  It feels so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls struggled, and Stacy stepped forward to intervene.  Then the light struck Amy&#39;s thigh.  They watched in fascination as it ballooned in size.  Thick muscle expanded in her thighs, and her leg got a little bit longer.  The girls dropped the flashlight in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, &quot; said Amy in shock.  &quot;I didn&#39;t realize it could do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy flexed her large quad muscles proudly.  Next to her other leg, it looked a little silly.  She tilted a little because one leg was longer than the other.  &quot;Do it again.  That felt even better than my dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah picked it up, and shined it on her own legs.  The masculine blue light caused her long legs to grow even longer.  Her thin thighs bulked up with powerful muscles. She moaned and closed her eyes, lost in the pleasure of her growth.  Stacy pulled the flashlight away from her.  Sarah opened her eyes.  She glared at Stacy with pure hate for denying her the bliss.  Then Sarah realized what she was doing and blushed.<br />
<br />
Stacy looked at the device in her hands, deep in thought.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, a little help here? At least balance me out, &quot; pleaded Amy. Her disproportionate legs caused her to lean against the wall to keep from falling over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a second.  I want to try something, &quot; said Stacy, as she shifted the light to its lowest pink setting.  She shined the light on Amy&#39;s large leg.  All of the thick male hair disappeared, but the strong powerful muscles remained behind. As the light shut off it left behind a leg that looked like it belonged on a powerful female body builder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; said Amy, as she stared at her new leg. &quot;Do you know what this means?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, &quot; said Stacy with a smile.  It was exactly what she hoped.  &quot;We can have the power of men, but still look like women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we can be Amazons!&quot; said Amy eagerly.<br />
<br />
She grabbed the keychain flashlight, and worked on her other leg. It was followed by her biceps and chest.  She reluctantly handed it over, and the girls passed it around, each enlarging their bodies.  By carefully adjusted the settings, they grew larger and more muscular while retaining a feminine figure.  By carefully directing the beam, they were even able to make their breasts larger, while having a broad muscular chest.<br />
<br />
Sam watched fearfully in the corner.  Stacy and her friends were slowly becoming monsters.  They were tall before, but now they seemed enormous.  They were easily over seven feet tall, and Sarah might have been even taller.  Their muscles put even a male bodybuilder to shame.  And they all had huge dicks. Sam felt very vulnerable as a small 5 foot tall girl.  He decided this was a bad idea, and that perhaps he should leave.  He gulped nervously as he watched Amy flex her enormous bicep.  Amy looked up at him and smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see short stuff?&quot; said Amy, as she walked slowly towards him.  The ground shook a little as she walked.  &quot;Care to sample the goods?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam was horrified. He didn&#39;t want this.  He backed away, but Amy had him trapped in a corner.  She held up her semi-erect dick. &quot;C&#39;mon.  I&#39; m just itching to try my new toy out, and you look like just the one to try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam winced and closed his eyes as Amy waved her dick in his face.  Suddenly, a large arm pulled Amy away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, leave the girl alone.  She is not interested,&quot; said Stacy, as she shoved Amy hard in the chest.<br />
<br />
Amy glared at her.  &quot;Of course, she is interested.  Every girl loves a good dick. She&#39;s just a little shy, aren&#39;t you? &quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
Stacy crossed her arms, standing in front of Sam.  Stacy was a little bit bigger than Amy, but it would still be an impressive fight between the titans.  But Amy saw the fear and repulsion in Sam&#39;s eyes, and backed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see.  My dick&#39;s not good enough for you, but hers is?  Fine, keep your little pet bitch.  Plenty of other fish in the sea, &quot; said Amy as she walked away.<br />
<br />
Stacy turned to Sam.  &quot;Sorry about that.  But I meant what I said.   You don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to do.  Don&#39;t worry about Amy.  She&#39;ll calm down.  And I&#39;ll make sure she leaves you alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy turned to face the other girls.  &quot;Okay girls I think we have done enough changing.  I think its time to get dressed and hit the town. &#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
Sarah sighed a little, but handed the flashlight back to Stacy.  &quot;What about her?  Is she going to change?&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; said Stacy. &quot;I think three Amazons are all this town could handle. But that doesn&#39;t mean she won&#39;t come out with us tonight and have a little fun. Come on, let&#39;s get dressed.  The device should have changed reality by now, so I am sure that I have some clothes that will fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah walked into Stacy&#39;s closet, but Amy lingered behind and glared at Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you little bitch, Stacy isn&#39;t always going to be around to protect you.  Some time tonight, when you least expect it, you are going to get it, &quot; said Amy, pounding her had into her fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy, come on.  Leave Sam alone and come get dressed, &quot; said Stacy.  Amy quickly followed Stacy into room, smiling as if nothing was wrong.<br />
<br />
Sam gulped again.  This had all been a terrible mistake.  He wished he had never found that stupid keychain flashlight.  Now it was going to get him killed.  Or worse.  At least it looked liked Stacy was honest, and was going to keep her end of the bargain.  If he could survive the night, that is.  Amy was right.  Stacy couldn&#39;t watch him all night long.  Maybe it was better to just slip away and try his luck at the magic shop.  But then again, that could be the only keychain.  What if there was nothing at the magic store that could help him?  Did he really want to spend the rest of his life as a short tomboy?  Then again, it would be better than being dead.  The voices of the girls grew louder.   They were almost ready to leave.  Sam needed to make a decision, and soon.</p>
