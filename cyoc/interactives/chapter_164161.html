<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake&#39;s stomach let out a loud growl, he was hungry again. James looked at the time, two in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I could cook something.&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can&#39;t make you do that, it&#39;s too much to ask.&quot; Jake said. &quot;How about we head out and grab some fast-food or something.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I guess, where&#39;d ya want to go?&quot; James asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just had a hankering for a burger... or five.&quot; Jake said patting his small pudgy belly. &quot;Just let me fix something really quick...&quot; He said opening his computer back up. &quot;And done.&quot; He said running off to his room. Jake came out of his room wearing some comfortable shorts and no shirt. To James it made Jake seem more naked than what he just was. &quot;Now I can hold my keys and stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No shirt?&quot; James asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t make them fit, not like I need to cover up anything anyway.&quot; Jake said pointing at his scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair point, so whose car are we taking?&quot; James asked. &quot;If we&#39;re taking mine then we&#39;re coming right back and eating because I don&#39;t want to sit in a fast-food place.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good with me.&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
James grabbed his car keys and they both left. Jake followed James to his car and got in. James had to get used to sitting in his car with a tail, he kept moving it into more and more uncomfortable positions. It took about ten minutes to drive to the nearest fast food joint. James pulled into the busy drive through and waited a good ten some minutes for everyone in front of them to order their food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, welcome, may I take your order.&quot; A tired voice said through the speaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, can I get a... number three, large.&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, and what would you like to drink with that?&quot; They asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Sprite is fine.&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, can I get you anything else today?&quot; The tired voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you want?&quot; James asked Jake. Jake just leaned as far as he could over James letting his slight pudgy belly rub against him. He couldn&#39;t stop blushing as Jake rattled off his order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get three number three&#39;s, Two number fives, Four number twos, and a number six, all larger.&quot; Jake said. &quot;Oh, and I only need one drink with that.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would that be?&quot; The tired voice asked with a hint of fear in their voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sprite would be fine.&quot; Jake said sitting back down in his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to eat all of that?&quot; James yelled quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your total is $96.21.&quot; The tired voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; James said pulling his car forwards. &quot;96 dollars Jake, you better eat all of that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You already know we don&#39;t have to worry about money.&quot; Jake said pulling out five twenties from his wallet. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m going to eat it all.&quot; he said. James pulled up to the first window.<br />
<br />
&quot;$96.21.&quot; The worker said. James handed them the hundred dollars. &quot;Here&#39;s your change, have a nice day.&quot; They said handing James a few dollars and a bunch of coins. He haphazardly tossed the money into his center console and drove up to the next window. He prepared himself for the onslaught of bags full of food. James was handed four bags of food. Four full bags of food now all balanced on Jake&#39;s scaly lap.<br />
<br />
It took another ten minutes to get back to their dorm. James fished out his burger and began eating. It took him a bit to finish it mostly because he was enjoying the show of Jake tearing through his burgers and fries. Jake stopped with half of his burgers left uneaten, but he did eat all of the fries which in it of itself is a hard feat for any person.<br />
<br />
&quot;You giving up?&quot; James asked. He couldn&#39;t keep himself from looking at Jake&#39;s larger belly. His pants had grown tight through his enhanced gorging.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not, I&#39;m just taking a break.&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;s going to get cold and gross.&quot; James said. He grabbed one of the burgers and held it in front of Jake&#39;s face. Jake swallowed the burger whole and groaned. His stomach was in pain, he couldn&#39;t eat any more, but he couldn&#39;t let James down. James held another burger in front of Jake and he again swallowed the entire thing whole. Then another came and the exact same thing happened. Jake was in pain from stuffing himself with so much food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two more big guy.&quot; James said taking a slight break to massage Jake&#39;s growing gut. Jake Had to have packed on at least twenty pounds from this single meal. Another burger was waved in front of Jake&#39;s scaly maw and he ate the thing whole. There was a small ping and Jake breathed a sigh of relief as the pressure against his stomach disappeared. The button on his shorts had popped of. James watched as it jiggled ever so  slightly. The thought of actually making him large enough to pop a button made James exited. He wanted to make Jake massive and this was just the first step. &quot;Last one.&quot; James said holding it in front of Jake. He wasted no time and gorged down the last burger. A loud burp echoed through dorm.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was delicious... I guess I might be skipping out on dinner tonight.&quot; Jake laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, I&#39;m surprised you ate all of that.&quot; James said massaging his hands across Jake&#39;s now fat belly. Jake started to purr, he really enjoyed the feeling of his gut getting squished around. They went on like that for a while until Jake broke the comfortable silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna go take a shower.&quot; He said getting up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun with that.&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
Jake closed the bathroom door behind him and let his, now ruined, shorts fall to the floor. He turned on the shower and looked at himself in the mirror. He had a scaly potbelly and his tail was starting to fill out as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I get this fat so fast?&quot; He said to himself. Jake stepped under the hot water and felt each individual drop ride down his body and tail. He started washing all of his scales, being dirty was one of Jake&#39;s biggest pet peeves, he absolutely hated being dirty.<br />
<br />
James took advantage of this time alone to use the Chronivac. He popped open Jake&#39;s computer and booted up the program. The entire process only took a minute. James looked over Jake&#39;s profile, he was now a little over 200 pounds. That made James smile, next milestone is 300.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can get you there by the end of the week.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
Jake continued to wash his body. He enjoyed sinking his hands into his fatty midsection.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I get bigger?&quot; He said to himself. &quot;James already loves it, and I think it feels amazing, all warm in soft. I want more, I want to be bigger.&quot; He said hefting his small gut up and letting it flop back down. He enjoyed that feeling. His dick started to poke out of its slit, just thinking about it is making him aroused. Using the Chronivac to make himself gain weight faster seems like an amazing idea.<br />
<br />
Jake finished up with his shower and unlocked the door. James went in right after him. Jake smiled, now he had privacy and could hide what he was doing from James. He opened up the Chronivac and searched for the weight options. The first thing that appeared caught his attention. Two things that seemed out of the ordinary. Weight gained by eating and weight gained by being fed by James were already at values higher than one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it... did it know that was what I wanted?&quot; Jake said to himself. He set both values to 5 and began looking for other options he wanted to change... But he didn&#39;t want to be the only one gaining any weight, James should get a bit thicker too.<br />
<br />
Jake searched through James&#39; profile and found his weight tab. Jake bound his own weight gain to James&#39; weight gain. James would now gain 10% of all the weight Jake gained, a perfect plan for a perfect boyfriend. Now if he could only get him to agree to become a T-rex like himself. He thought...</p>
