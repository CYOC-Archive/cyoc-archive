<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I walked onto the train and brushed passed some guy in a suit. A business man in his late twenties I guessed. He was talking to a friend obviously about business. he gave me a quick snide condescending look. I think because of my sloppy teenaged style. He obviously thought of himself as a dignified classy man. I could tell by the way he moved and looked at others around him. And of course by his very expensive looking suit. He had very neatly trimmed facial hair and dark features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid kid&quot; he said to the other guy as I passed. I turned to face him and looked him up and down. He had a nice body and the fabric of the suit outlined his package and ass nicely. He asked me what I was looking at, in that same condescending manner.<br />
<br />
I told him that shouldn&#39;t be so haughty as we are &quot;all the same animal underneath&quot;.<br />
He laughed at this and went back to talking to his friend. &quot;We may just find out what kind of animal you could be&quot;, I said as I walked to the other end of the car.<br />
<br />
It was rush hour and the train was filling up with other business people, students, children etc. The train started to go. I looked at the man still talking business, stock market or something and I telekinetically undid his tie which slid to the ground.<br />
His friend pointed that out and the business man bent over to pick it up and BOOM.. I made his expensive jacket fly off and land at the other end of the car. He was startled and started to walk towards where his jacket was lying when his shirt opened up revealing a hairy chest.<br />
<br />
People turned and stared and he triedd to close his shirt but then I ripped it right off.  Now that panicked man was shirtless in the busy train looking around for his tattered shirt. <br />
<br />
He fell back on his ass as I pulled of his shoes and socks. His friend came to help him up. The crowd was clearing around him. The embarrassed man stood up and told his friend he had no idea how this could be happening. He certainly didn&#39;t look dignified any more. Sweating and blushing shirtless in a packed train with everyone staring at him.<br />
<br />
His belt flew away and his suit pants came down. He bent down to try to pull them up but then i ripped them right off and threw them across the car. He yelled as he again fell to the ground. Now he was only in his boxers. The outline of his big package could be seen through the loose boxers as he stood up covering himself. He looked around shocked and the equally shocked people looking back at him. His friend backed away not knowing what to do.<br />
<br />
I walked over to him into the clearing around him and stood in front of him and again  looked at him and down. He had a slightly furry abdomen with a trail running downwards from his belly button and muscular hairy legs. He stared back at me. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your letting your inner animal out&quot; I answered. &quot;What?&quot; he said and then he told me to move out of his way so he could find his &quot;fucking clothes!&quot; As he pushed passed me I told him that he should just let it all hang out.<br />
<br />
Then his boxers tore off. He screamed as he realized that he was stark naked in the middle of the train. The other passengers backed away more. He bent over covering himself. A group of schoolgirls started laughing. He had quite furry ass and he put one hand over his ass crack  and the other over his swinging dick as he squatted down. &quot;Someone help me!&quot; He screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, your just a hairy animal&quot; I laughed. &quot;look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I telekinetically pushed him on to all fours. He tried to stand but I held him like that. The shocked crowd stared down at him. With my mind I reached into his vocal chords and made him bark.  Then again louder. The mortified man tried to speak and say that he didn&#39;t want to bark. But I interrupted him making him bark loudly repeatedly. <br />
<br />
I then  made him get up into a begging position. I held him like that for a while so we could could all get a look at his big dangling dick and balls. His pubes were bushy and unkept. Tears started to form in his eyes at this point. He looked at everyone&#39;s shocked faces as they stared at his genitals as he crouched on his haunches with his his hands up. <br />
<br />
I then made him crawl around on all fours sniffing peoples feet. Everyone was getting an eyeful of his ass and back of his balls as he did this. He then rolled around a bit on the dirty floor. Every time he tried to say something I made him bark more. I made him crawl to one of the bars in the train and raise a leg as if he was going to pee on it. We could see right to his hairy anus and big nut sack when he did this. I pushed on his bladder and some pee dribbled and spread across the floor. people jumped back from the spreading pool of urine. His face was a crimson red and he was wide eyed as every part of him was revealed to all these strangers.<br />
<br />
Finally I put him back on all fours. I pushed my invisible mind&#39;s finger into his ass hole. He squirmed and winced as I did this. Everyone looking could just see his ass spreading a bit. Someone said &quot;oh no I think he is going to crap&quot;.<br />
I found his prostate and started massaging it. The look on his face was shock and shear mortification as he wiggled in rhythm with the massage. I then telekinetically stroked his penis until it was rock hard.<br />
<br />
He looked around at everyone in horror but despite his embarrassment he started to pant in sexual ecstasy. He moaned and wiggled his butt as he felt a finger in his ass and and a tickling around his junk.  Just before he came I made him get back up into that begging position so everyone could see his big dick shoot. And it did shoot right onto a man&#39;s pants. Soon thick ropes of cum were dripping off his deflating cock.  He looked around at the crowd of strangers who had just witnessed him pissing and cumming . There were people of all ages and all walks of life. I guess he didn&#39;t feel so superior at that moment.<br />
<br />
I let him go and he fell back onto all floor exhausted and not knowing what to do holding his head down. I walked over and patted his head. &quot;Good boy&quot; I said. Now we have all seen your inner animal. The train pulled into the next station and people started piling out as fast as they could. His friend sat on a seat flabbergasted.</p>
