<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin was still looking down at his pathetically skinny body as Ty left his room, just before the door closed all the 
<br>
 way though Ty told him that he had fixed it so that everybody would just think every thing was normal about Dustins new 
<br>
 frailer body and treat him accordingly. Ty said it all with a big grin on his face as the door closed leiveing Dustin 
<br>
 alone with only his own thoughts. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin didnt know what to do , he just threw on a long sleaved shirt and left it untucked it helped to cover his now 
<br>
 skinny ass, he also left the sleaves buttoned to cover his bony arms and thin wrist, his hands still looked to skinny 
<br>
 though and his fingers looked to long and thin on them. Poor Dustins legs were so thin that you could almost wrap one hand 
<br>
 around the circumference of his thin upper thigh. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin knew he would have to find someone who would beleive his storie someone who could help him get back what Ty had 
<br>
 taken from him. Maybe his dad would beleive him now that he was so thin and all, surely he remembered all the trophies that 
<br>
 he had earnd over his once promising athletic life, surely he would have to notice that he had been turned into a whimp. 
<br>
 and that Ty had done this to him. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin reluctantly went down stairs to see if his dad would notice the big change in him surly his mom would notice it, he 
<br>
 hoped. When dustin came into the kitchen though he knew he was wrong about that thought Ty was sitting at the table 
<br>
 smileing at him as he came in, &quot; HEY BEAN POLE HOWS IT KICKEN UP THEIR DUDE!!&quot; Ty said as he looked over at Mark and 
<br>
 smiled, &quot;So hey Mark how come Dustins such a bean pole and your the athletic type and all guy aint he your kid dude?&quot; Ty 
<br>
 said with a giggle as the now super thin Dustin sat down next to his dad. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Stop that Ty you know thats not a nice thing to say about your step brother!&quot; Dustins mother added quickly. &quot;Now Dustin 
<br>
 you be sure and eat all thats on this plate dear, I want you to be as big and strong as Ty you know son!&quot; Mom said as she 
<br>
 put the plate off eggs down in front of Dustin, Dustin looked down at the plate and then back up to Ty, he was furious 
<br>
 somehow Ty had fixed it so that even his parents thought he was just a whimp, and worst of all that he was now smaller than 
<br>
 Ty as well. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin knew he wasent going to get any help at home, and he was now starving to death as well and he heartly ate all that 
<br>
 was on his plate, maybee he'd just gain his lost weight back. Ty watched as him as he ate his food &quot;Aint it weird the way 
<br>
 some people can eat anything and never gain a pound of weight or fat Mark!&quot; Ty said as he smiled at Dustin. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustins mom then came around the table and patted Dustins thin tall skinny shoulder, now leive my tall man alone Ty you 
<br>
 know hes just to tall for his body he'll fill out someday.&quot; she said as she put more food on dustins plate,Dustin was 
<br>
 mortified by all of this somehow Ty had manipulated his parents into beleiving that he was always this tall and skinny and 
<br>
 not the proud super jock he was just this past friday! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;IM NOT THIS FUCKING SKINNY MOM!! TY CHANGED ME INTO THIS !!&quot; Dustin finally blurted out in a desperate sounding yell 
<br>
 &quot;Oh come on Dustin youve always been a little on the skinny side dont blame Ty for that son! God only knows whitch side of 
<br>
 the famaly you take after but I guess its noy mine!&quot; Mark said as he got up from the table, &quot;Hey Ty now you watch out for 
<br>
 your brother today alright son.&quot; Mark said as he left the kitchen, Mark swung around and gave his wife a kiss and walked 
<br>
 back over to the table and out his big strong hands on his now pathetic looking sons shoulders, and gently squeezed them. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty couldnt beleive the diffrences in the two now, friday they looked like a father son picture. With Mark as the 
<br>
 athletic good looking strong dad and his up and comeing good looking jock son following his dad into adulthood with the 
<br>
 asurence of both good looks and a strong big body to match that of his good looking dads. 
<br>

<br>
 Not now though now the sons body was that of a whimps and they looked almost to diffrent to each other to even be a 
<br>
 father and son duo again. Ty thought about that and a great big smile came over his face, &quot;Hey Dustin you wanna look like 
<br>
 your dad again dont ya?&quot; Ty asked as his dad walked over to his mom to kiss her, &quot; Please yes Ty make me look like my dad 
<br>
 again PLEASE!!&quot; Dustin said in a whisper 
<br>

<br>
 Dustins dad wasent a slouch in any way he was in his mid thirtys and fit as you could get at that age he was a handsome 
<br>
 speicimen of a man at 6'2&quot; and 195lbs he was big as well and good looking to boote, with deep dimpled cheeks and a strong 
<br>
 jaw line he was the mans man. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well OK then here goes then Dustin ya ready for the big change dude?&quot;Ty said with an evil grin. Dustin thought some 
<br>
 thing was wrong with all of this but he didnt know what! he just wanted to be big again and just waited for the change to 
<br>
 occure. 
<br>

<br>
 Dustin didnt feel any changes as he watched Ty though, as a matter of fact Ty wasent even looking at him he was stairing 
<br>
 at Mark and squinting his eyes real hard as he did Dustin watched in horror as his musculare dads frame began to grow 
<br>
 thinner his form fitting Tee shirt got looser on his torso as the muscles faded fast from his frame, and his tight fitting 
<br>
 jeans began to get looser and more baggyer on his now thinning legs, he seemed to be obliveuos to it though and so did his 
<br>
 wife as they continued their embrase poor Mark was fadeing fast before Dustins eyes he couldnt beleive this Ty hadent meant 
<br>
 to change him he only meant to make his dad as small and skinny as he was now. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark started to notice the changes in him though Ty couldnt seem to control his mind as well as he had hoped and as poor 
<br>
 Mark got thinner he also got more awear of the changes to him, Mark could feel his jeans slipping down his narrowering 
<br>
 thighs and he could see his forarms growwing smaller and more frail looking, he hadnt lost any of his height but he was 
<br>
 dropping in weight fast. M ark made a feable attempt to grab at his jeans as they rode down his thinning thighs and fell 
<br>
 all bunched up around his now knobby knees his boxer breifs barly clung around his waist his legs were now skeletor at best 
<br>
 and the sleeves of the once tight fitting tee shirt hung down to his thin knobby elbows, Mark was now the perfect dad for 
<br>
 such a skinny kid as Ty had made Dustin into.</p>
