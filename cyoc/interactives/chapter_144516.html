<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday morning, 6:31AM. Just enough time for another cup of coffee and a bagel before Scott and I had to head to work. We had both gone through Academy at the same time and were placed as rookies on the K9 unit. We’re partners, so the guys in charge figured it would be easier for the both of us if we lived together. So, we share a two bedroom in a quiet complex about 15 minutes from the precinct. A few of the other guys on the unit have places here too. All in all, it’s not a bad setup.<br />
<br />
I had my white tee on, which I tucked into my navy blues. I fastened the button and grabbed my coffee cup. I walked into the living room and found Scott naked on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Dude. What are you doing? We’re going to be late for work”. I told him.<br />
<br />
“But dude”, he whined. “I didn’t get any head this weekend. I was hopin’ for one last BJ before work”. He smirked.<br />
<br />
“So put your collar on and do it yourself” I said.<br />
<br />
“You know it’s not the same! I like to lay back and feel another mouth on my cock” He retorted.<br />
<br />
“I dunno,” I shrugged. “Sometimes I prefer sucking my own instead of going through the hassle of finding someone else to do it.”<br />
<br />
“Hassle! Bro. You know I’ll suck you off anytime you want, you just gotta ask!” He smirked.<br />
<br />
I sighed. “Okay”. Scott become giddy. I swear I saw his dick get a bit harder just from the thought of in the incoming blowjob. “But you gotta be quick. Then it’s collar time for you. You gotta be on all fours and us out the door by 7 sharp”. I set my coffee down and walked toward the couch.<br />
***<br />
John set his coffee down and starting walking toward the couch. Unfortunately, I was so pent up from the weekend it probably would be quick. He dropped to his knees in front of me, and I felt my cock bounce and surge with blood.<br />
<br />
John and I are partners on the K9 unit for our town, which means we live together in pet friendly complex pretty close to the precinct. It’s a great setup since we’re both gay. We’re not dating each other, but it’s great to have a live in bro who will...<br />
<br />
“Uhnn...” I moaned.<br />
<br />
...who’s just as happy to suck you off as he is to let you suck him off. We fuck each other too, which is what I really wanted to do when I saw his tight butt walk in is his navy blue’s; but I knew we didn’t have time for that.<br />
<br />
*Slurp* “Damn, you’re leaking already bro. This is gonna be quick” John smirked. He was right. It didn’t help that he’s really, really good at sucking cock.<br />
<br />
“Slow down man, just let me enjoy it” I pleaded. He pulled off, still holding my cock, looked me in the eye and smiled. <br />
<br />
“Bro. If you wanted a longer session...” he stopped and licked my tip. “You should have asked earlier” he said while rubbing my cock in his beard. I moaned. “I’m not getting kennel duty again because of you” and with that my cock disappeared down his throat as he milked me for all I was worth.<br />
<br />
“UGHNN... Bro... Oh God! John...” I pleaded with John, but his head bobbing or cock sucking didn’t slow. “Oh God, I’m gonna... I’m close man! I’m gonna...”<br />
***<br />
Scott grunted as his dick swelled in my throat. I felt his hands on my head as I felt his load shooting into my stomach. I counted the spurts. 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. “Damn man” I said as I pulled off his dick. “6 shots, you were pent up.” I leaned down and lightly sucked his tip, making him shudder and moan a bit more. I put both hands on his thighs and used them to push myself up. I’d made myself hard, definitely tenting my briefs. Though, thankfully I wasn’t as horny as Scott so I didn’t leak through to my pants, otherwise I’d have to change. Scott eyed my bulge.<br />
<br />
“I could help ya out with that you know” he smirked, reaching for the button of my pants.<br />
<br />
“Ah-ah” I said, backing away. “Nice try. You gotta collar up while I finish getting dressed. I’ll take care of this myself tonight.” I said, walking away toward my bedroom.<br />
<br />
“You know, I could help you after work too” I heard from over my shoulder as I grabbed my coffee cup.<br />
<br />
“Nope. You know my rule. Only when we’re the same species. Now collar up Rocket, we gotta go soon!” And I left Scott to get ready as I walked back into my bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Will ya at least rub my belly?” Scott called after me, and I laughed. “Only if you’re a good boy!”<br />
***<br />
I watched John walk back into his room, leaving me on the couch. We’ve been on the force for about 3 months now. We switch weekly, and one of us is on all fours from Monday morning until Friday evening. Then the collar comes off and we get the weekend on two legs. Some guys go two weeks on two weeks off, and a few even decided to do a month as a dog before switching. Charlie and Tony, a few doors down are like that. Charile, er, Rocky, was starting his third week as a drug sniffing yellow lab at the airport. In two weeks Rocky would be replaced by Duke the black lab, and Charlie would have a full month as one of my favorite blonde fuck buddies. “I hope I get a chance to sniff his butt today” I said to myself, rising from the couch. <br />
<br />
I slipped my collar off the hook by the door. Since John had been nice enough to blow me before work, I figured I would leash myself up too. I gave myself pause to make sure I didn’t need to piss one last time as a two-legger. Bladder empty, I sighed, attached the leash to my tags and slipped my collar on.<br />
<br />
I felt the familiar sting on the back of my neck as the collar attached. I’m not 100% sure on what all goes on when we put these things on. The scientists who made them explained it all to us on the first day, but it was a lot of jargon and a lot to take in, especially considering after the explanation we were going to be turning into dogs. It was the last week of Academy, right after we’d been given our assignment. All the guys were pretty pumped to be working with dogs; all of us growing up with dogs had made us perfect candidates for the K9 unit. None of knew what we were in for. They had given us the option to back out though, once we found out what the position entailed. Surprisingly, none of the guys did. We were all curious, and some even excited, to see what life was like on four legs. The science guys said we should all get to know each other on the canine level, so we all stripped down and put the collars on. Man, that first change was wild. Tails sprouting, guys moaning, fur growing, dogs howling, and a whole lot of butt sniffing when it was all said and done. There were a few labs, yellow and black, a couple Dobermans, the 6’4” guy Noah became a Great Dane, and three German Shepherds like me. <br />
<br />
Whatever it was that caused the change, well, it didn’t numb you. I could feel the fur growing in just fine. It did something along the lines of blocking pain receptors, since the feeling of your jaw breaking as you grew a muzzle or your knees reversing would probably be pretty excruciating. No, I still felt things, like what was going on around my crotch.<br />
<br />
I gave a quiet moan as fur covered my ballsack. The fur kept going to my inner thighs and around my butt, but I focused my attention on my cock. It always fascinated me to watch my circumcised cock turn into my little rocket. The tip grew out, losing definition. I amalready pretty big to start with, so I don&#39;t gain any length, but my penile bone did grow in making me look bigger and causing my little rocket to stand against my stomach. Then the fold of skin and fur, my sheath, started growing at the base up around my shaft until my cock was completely hidden inside.<br />
<br />
By now my hands were shifting into my front paws. Fingers shrunk as my fingernails grew out in small black points. They were longer than usual, which probably meant a trip to the station groomer this afternoon. The tan and black fur covered my new paws and raced up my arms as the muscle mass shifted. My upper arms shrank pretty significantly as my chest barreled out, leaving my arms... err, front legs, positioned on the sides of my body. The fur from my front legs raced down my stomach to meet the fur that grew in around my thighs and sheath. The fur on my stomach was mostly milky white, but changed into the traditional tan around my ribs and more black around my back. My toes started shrinking next, with my pinky toe traveling up to become a dew claw. Hind leg nails were pretty long too, I was definitely going to the groomer this afternoon. It was as I was thinking about my upcoming trip that my knees reversed and knocked me off my bi-pedal stance. I fell forward, catching myself on my front paws. My thighs grew wide and powerful while the muscles of my butt thinned. My spine started stretching out into my foot long fluffy tail. Everything below my collar was 100% German shepherd. I sat down on my haunches to wait for John as my head went through the change. Fur raced up my neck and around my ears as they grew to the top of my head. It kept growing down my forehead as my nose stretched out into my muzzle. My tongue grew long, flat, and dexterous as my jaw lengthened. I’d definitely be using that on myself later tonight if I didn’t get a “play date” with Rocky. My nose turned damp and black, and the usual flood of new smells washed over me. I instinctively bent in on myself to give my balls a good sniff when John walked in the room.<br />
<br />
“Ready to go Rocket?” John asked. I turned away from my balls to watch him approach me as the color drained from my vision. The last change hit, as canine instincts and training came rushing through my altered brain. John was my master now, and would be until Friday evening when he took my collar off.<br />
<br />
“Woof!” I responded, raising to all fours. I wasn’t completely dog in my thought processes, there was still a fair bit of Scott running around my brain. There was just enough dog for me to follow orders from John.<br />
<br />
“Good boy Rocket” John said, picking up my leash and giving me a scritch behind my ear.</p>
