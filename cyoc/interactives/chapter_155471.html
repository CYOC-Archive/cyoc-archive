<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa and Katie looked nervously at one another as they headed towards Kellies house. While the admission of Kellie Kellie and Jack having sex had been a shocker, their friends had decided to keep It amongst themselves. While Kellie was still mortified about it things had begun to return to normal. That is until today.<br />
<br />
Kellie had been anxious and frightened throughout the day at school. Whenever anyone tried to talk with her she would dismiss their concerns. Things only became stranger when she pulled Jack to the side. While no one knew what they said, they could see the color drain from Jacks face. After the school day ended Kellie rushed home, only to frantically call Katie and Lisa and ask them to come over. As the two teens now knocked on Kellies door they wondered what exactly was going on. Their curiosity only grew when Kellie flung open the door looking panicked.<br />
<br />
“Come in,” she whispered. “And keep the noise down.” Lisa and Kellie gave eachother curious looks as they now followed Kellie upstairs. Instead of taking the twins to her room, Kellie instead crept quietly into the bathroom, locking the door behind. “Um Kel,” Katie said. “Why are we locked in your bathroom?” Kellie said nothing, her face pale as she gestured towards the sink. The two teens eyes grew wide as they could see a pregnancy test laying on the sink. “Kellie is that,” Lisa gasped.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Kellie whispered fearfully. “I’m pregnant.”<br />
<br />
The three teens leaned closer to the test, their jaws hanging open as the unmistakable plus sign appeared on the test. No one could utter a word, let alone breath as they tried to wrap their minds around this. “What are you going to say to Merlin,” Katie finally said, breaking the deafening silence. “I don’t know,” Kellie whined. “I have no idea what the hell Im going to do. I’m a freaking teenager with an adult mind and inter dimensional wizard who could kill me and resurrect me just to kill me again.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think he’ll do that,” Katie stated in awe.<br />
<br />
“I would,” Kellie exclaimed. “I mean if it were my kid that got knocked up at 16 I would go through the roof. He’s going to kill me, then he’s going to kill Jack.”<br />
<br />
“But Lilith,” Lisa said quickly, realizing that if Merlin went after Jack, Lilith would stand in his way. Kellie could only shake her head. “Dad won’t care,” she sighed. “He’s a parent now.  Dads, especially when it comes to their daughters lose their damn minds. Now imagine a dad with enough magic to destroy a planet, you see what I’m getting at here.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Lisa gulped, nodding in response. “So what do you need us to do,” Katie asked. Kellie sighed, her shoulders slumping as she looked towards her friends with weary eyes. “Look I have to tell him,” she groaned. “This isn’t something I can keep from him. I....I just need some moral support. That and I think he won’t completely lose his mind if their are witnesses.” Katie and Lisa could only furrow their brows as they gazed at Kellie. They wanted to help their friend and would be their for her no matter what. This, however, seemed like Kellie was using them as human shields.<br />
<br />
Kellie, Katie, and Lisa now slowly approached Merlin’s study. The plan was simple, if not foolhardy. Kellie would be straightforward with her father, showing him the pregnancy test and even saying who the father was. After that she would apologize for screwing up like this. Kellie had a feeling she would be apologizing for this one for the rest of her life. As they slowly opened the door they could see Merlin reading at his desk. The ancient wizard raising his eyes, giving the three teens a warm smile. “Hello girls what a pleasant surprise.”<br />
<br />
Kellies stomach was in knots as she looked at her father. Merlin would be devastated by this, she hated disappointing him. “Dad there’s something I need to tell you,” she said hoarsely. “Sounds serious,” Merlin replied as he beckoned the three teens to his desk. “What is troubling you Kellie?”<br />
<br />
Kellie took a deep breath before conjuring the positive pregnancy test. Merlin gazed at it still somewhat confused by what his daughter was showing him. “Dad,” Kellie said weakly. “I just took this when I got home. I’m pregnant.”<br />
<br />
Merlin said nothing as he gazed at the positive test, his fists clenched tightly snapping the pen he was holding in two. “Okay,” he said calmly, trying to control his rage. “Kellie...this....this is big news. Now tell me, who is the father?”<br />
<br />
“Dad I just want....”<br />
<br />
“Who is the father,” Merlin said tersely, his voice causing cracks to form in the ceiling as the house shook beneath their feet. Kellie felt herself break into a cold sweat as she gazed at the wizard. “Jack,” she said quietly, wincing as she readied herself for Merlin’s wrath.<br />
<br />
Merlin said nothing, his body seeming to relax as he sank into his chair. “I see,” he said quietly. Slowly Merlin now rose from his chair, gathering his robes about him as he robotically walked towards his study door. “Thank you for telling me,” he said flatly. “I shall return shortly.” As he closed the door the teens let out a sigh of relief. “Well that wasn’t so bad,” Lisa stated in relief. Kellie shook her head as she bit her lip nervously. “No it’s bad,” she said. “How though,” Katie asked, Kellies head sank as she now turned to her friends. “He’s on his way to Jacks house.”<br />
<br />
******************************<br />
<br />
Lilith smirked as she now approached Circe, a cup of tea in hand. The two witches had been getting along splendidly since they were affected by the hourglass. On top of that they were also turning quite a profit from their ownership of the amusement park. With plans on expanding their empire and with Jack safely growing in power the two felt completely at ease. “Your tea dear Circe,” Lilith smiled.<br />
<br />
Circe thanked her partner as she once more turned to the expense reports. “Thank you my friend,” Circe smiled. “I was in need of a calming drink. Our profit margins are increasing however these expansion ideas have me worried. Yes things are proceeding well but what if we fail. We could lose everything.”<br />
<br />
“As long as we are together nothing can stop us,” Lilith grinned. Circe looked up at Lilith, a feeling of confidence washing over her. It seemed impossible to fathom that only a short time ago the two of them were ready to destroy one another. “You know if you have some free time I was wondering if you would go with me to get my nails done?” Lilith nodded as she now sat next to Circe. “Splendid idea.” Both witches gave eachother a warm smile as they began to go over the expansion plans together.<br />
<br />
An explosion now rocked Lilith and Circes home, knocking the two witches to the ground. Dusting themselves off they now gazed in bewilderment at the gaping whole that had once been the front of their home. Merlin was floating before them, his eyes glowing a brilliant white as glared at Lilith and Circe. “Where is Jack,” he bellowed.<br />
<br />
“So,” Lilith growled. “It has come to this finally. I knew it was only a matter of time before you made a move against my son,” Lilith dusted herself off, her size increasing as her eyes began to glow red. The demon witches nails grew, sharpening into talons. Circe now stood as well, glaring at the ancient wizard. “Even your power is no match for our combined strength,” Circe stated as she stood side by side with Lilith.<br />
<br />
Merlin gave the two witches a snide smile as he scanned the room. “I do not have time for your blustering,” he growled. “Now where is your son? He has much to answer for.” As the three all powerful sorcerers now glared at eachother it was Baba Yaga who stepped in between. “Merlin,” she yelled, shocked by her former lovers anger. “What is the meaning of this? What are you doing!”<br />
<br />
“The boy Baba,” Merlin bellowed. “The boy must pay. WHERE IS HE!”<br />
<br />
Jack had been upstairs when he felt the explosion. Shocked he quickly picked himself off the ground,dusting himself as he nervously looked around. As he crept towards the stairs he listened to a mans voice bellow for him. “Merlin,” he thought. “What the hell is he doing here?” As he now listened he could feel the color drain from his face, Merlin was after him.<br />
<br />
“The boy has gone too far now Baba,” Merlin yelled.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about,” Baba pleaded, obviously confused. “Merlin please calm down.” Merlin roared as he began to advance into the house, only to be met by curses from both Lilith and Circe. The curses were meant to incapacitate the ancient wizard. Merlin grunted, collapsing to his knees as he glared at Lilith and Circe. A sadistic grin spread across Merlin’s face as he unleashed a spell, knocking the two witches through a nearby wall. “Damn it Merlin Stop,” Baba pleaded. “This makes no sense. Why are you so angry?”<br />
<br />
“Your child has sullied my daughter,” Merlin roared. “He has taken her virtue and left her with child. The boy must pay!”<br />
<br />
Lilith and Circe were dusting themselves off, ready to attack once more when they heard what Merlin had said. “Child,” Lilith asked. “What are you saying?”<br />
<br />
“Jack has impregnated my daughter,” Merlin yelled, his voice cracking the very walls. Baba, Circe, and Lilith stared dumbstruck at the angry wizard. It was finally Lilith who snapped out of her stupor, turning red with anger. “Jack get down here now,” she screamed.<br />
<br />
Jack had been listening to the fight, his eyes going wide when Merlin revealed the source of his anger. Kellie was pregnant? He couldn’t believe it. Peaking his head downstairs he could see Merlin, Circe, Baba, and Lilith in the living room. As his mother saw him, he could see the rage in her eyes. “Boy you have some explaining to do,” she screamed. “How could you lay with that harlot.”<br />
<br />
“My daughter is no harlot,” Merlin growled. “Your demon spawn of a son must have bewitched her. Taken advantage of her somehow.” As the Lilith, Circe, and Merlin began to argue a new, Jack was left dumbfounded. He and Kellie were going to have another child!<br />
<br />
Kellie didn’t  need magic to know things were not good. The blasts of magical energy emanating from around Jacks home told her that. As she rounded the corner with Lisa and Katie in tow, she winced. Most of  front of Jacks home had been destroyed by Merlin’s attack. As she approached she could see Merlin, Lilith, and Circe engaged in a war of words. It appeared the three of them were now debating whose fault this was. “Oh shit,” she muttered.<br />
<br />
“That would  be putting it lightly.”<br />
<br />
Kellie spun around to see Baba Yaga looking at her a disapproving look on her ancient face. “Usually a congratulations would be in order for an event such as this,” she grumbled. “However considering you and Jack are still merely children I think it would be more appropriate to simply say, you two are idiots.”<br />
<br />
Kellie could only blush, offering a weak apology as she now hung her head. Jack and Kellies families were about to have a very uncomfortable conversation.</p>
