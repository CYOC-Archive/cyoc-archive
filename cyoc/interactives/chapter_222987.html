<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After debating the idea back and forth in their head for a few minutes, Ben caved in. He just had to try out some of these clothes! As they stepped into the shop, a sense of excitement started building in their chest. Where to start?<br />
<br />
Walking through the aisles, Ben picked a number of items and immediately put them back on rack, unsure.  They gave a few glances around but nobody was actually paying attention to their browsing. Still, they couldn&#39;t make up their mind. Maybe a dress was a bit too bold or feminine on him? And what if the sport bras made him look silly?<br />
<br />
Finally, they entered the changing rooms with a few items in hand: a pair of mini shorts, a crop top, a flannel shirt, and a bikini ensemble.<br />
<br />
The flannel shirt was nothing too out of the ordinary except for the bold black and purple colour of the pattern. Most of Ben&#39;s old wardrobe was in the usual earth tones, dark blues, grey and blacks... boring. At the moment they wanted something a little more daring. Maybe not bright pink, for sure, but the deep purple looked rad.<br />
<br />
The pair of mini shorts was pale blue women&#39;s jeans and a tight fit for Ben, but after some efforts and wiggling they were able to zip them up. Looking at themselves in the stall&#39;s mirror, they found that the mini shorts emphasized their glutes and strong hips, and rather liked that, even though the front squished their package almost painfully.<br />
<br />
Then they tried the crop top. It was a simple black shirt somewhat loose around the neck and shoulders, but cut short around the ribcage. Turning around and looking at the mirror, Ben again liked what they saw. Their abs were proudly exposed, showing off Ben&#39;s lithe silhouette. The cotton texture was also extremely soft against Ben&#39;s skin; they felt their nipples harden when the fabric brushed against them. <br />
<br />
Ben chuckled to themself lightly and lifted the shirt to inspect their pecs. The nipples were indeed poking out in their glory, fatter than they used to be. In fact, the areola around them also looked slightly different, larger and somewhat darker, and the muscle mass undernearth seemed to make them puff outward.<br />
<br />
Removing the shirt to put on the bikini top, Ben&#39;s cheeks flashed with red. This, now, was a little more intimidating. The bikini was simple and white, just a cut of triangles in thin fabric really, adjusted with simple threads. Placing the triangles on their chest and tying the threads behind their back and neck, Ben felt a rush of adrenaline and euphoria as the tiny mounds of flesh filled the space without making it look too weird.<br />
<br />
Ben then moved on to try out the bottom piece, which was the least likely to fit. The front piece of white fabric wasn&#39;t actually too narrow, but it was still not cut with their package in mind. After a minute of tugging and pushing their junk around, the bulge was finally contained, though Ben knew their ballsack might slip out at any chance. Looking at their butt over their shoulder, they were very pleased to see the thin thread of the bikini disappear between their toned butt cheeks and exposing their rounded shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I look incredible actually!&quot; Ben thought, a little flustered. Maybe he half-wished there was a little more to their chest perhaps to fill out the triangle top... After a minute though, arching their back, turning around, and looking at themselves in a profile view, it did look as though there was at least SOME amount of soft flesh under the areolas giving a slight semblance of perky shapes under the fabric, which Ben found inexplicably comforting.<br />
<br />
Another wave of heat washed over him, after looking at themselves so much in the mirror and liking themselves more and more. As Ben shifted poses again, their face turned red as they noticed their cock half-swelling and straining in the bikini, tenting the upside down triangle of fabric away from their groin. &quot;Fuck&quot;, they groaned under their breath, &quot;not again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Footsteps stopped on the other side of the drawn curtain of Ben&#39;s stall and a voice called: &quot;Do you need help choosing, mister? Are you all good in there?&quot; a male store clerk asked them.<br />
<br />
Ben shuddered and grabbed the shirt to cover their growing bulge frantically, nipples still poking through the bikini top, and a knot in their stomach. What would people think if they saw them like that? Ben&#39;s dick responded to that thought with a small throb, much to their surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m all good, thanks! Almost done!&quot; Ben let out to get rid of the clerk, while the bikini bottom was definitively tenting away from their body, exposing to view their meaty balls which slipped on each side of the tiny pouch. There was a small pause before the employee responded with an &quot;okay sir!&quot; and he walked away.<br />
<br />
Ben hurriedly removed the bikini pieces, blushing. The experience had been terrifying but also exhilirating, confusingly. Their half-erect cock swayed with their every movement until Ben shoved it forcefully in their underwear. They put on their previous clothes again, took all the new items under their arm, and walked to the counter to pay for them, the semi bouncing discreetly in their shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the girlfriend, uh?&quot; the lady at the cash register winked at Ben innocently as she scanned the apparel, oblivious.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right!&quot; Ben laughed, pretending that was the case.<br />
<br />
Ben paid and swiftly walked out of the store, sweat down their neck. They only slowed their pace when they arrived in sight of the campus co-op. On the way though, they couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the store and the euphoria they had felt trying out different clothes. Perhaps he should have gone for the sports bras, after all...? Or even a dress?<br />
<br />
They shook their head, chasing the sense of regret. They could always come back another time for more.<br />
<br />
As Ben entered their co-op, they realized they didn&#39;t really want to have to explain the bikini pieces to their flatmate, so they would probably have to hide that. Ben shared the place with their best friend Cal, who was more of a jock type than themself originally. Though they each had their own bedroom, they spent a lot of time together and were often in each other&#39;s business.<br />
<br />
Walking into the co-op and removing their shoes, Ben shouted out: &quot;Yo Cal, you there buddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Bryn, just a sec!&quot; Ben heard, not even noticing the change of name this time around, as though it felt natural.<br />
<br />
As they stepped into the living room area, they saw their shirtless friend finishing his work out, stepping up from his push-up series, his muscles glistening with sweat. Looking at Cal in this state with the new perspective of the day, Ben felt the funny feeling in his guts return.</p>
