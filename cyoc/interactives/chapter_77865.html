<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris leaned closer to the screen.  &quot;Well first I'm changing us back to bisexual..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;  Jush interrupted right away, moving over to the computer.  &quot;I don't want to change that, I'm happy the way that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not.&quot;  Chris quickly countered.  However, he did stop to listen to his brother before changing anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you?  Think about it.&quot;  Josh's words had an affect on Chris, who's mind was suddenly distracted by thoughts of that.  Josh broke in again, &quot;Here.  Let me try something.  If you still want to go back afterwards, then fine, we will.  But you gotta give me a chance first.&quot;  Josh gave his brother the best puppy dog eyes he could manage, though being twins, Chris could give them right back.<br />
<br />
Chris was shocked that he had lost the older brother edge.  Josh was acting like they were equals which, Chris guessed, they were now.  Chris sighed and got out of the chair, motioning for Josh to sit down.  &quot;Fine.  But it better be good.&quot;  Chris couldn't keep annoyance out of his voice.  But it wasn't with his brother.  He couldn't blame him for not wanting to mess around with his sexuality.  Chris just had a taste of that and he wasn't pleased.  He had tried thinking of Julie, his girlfriend before the accident with the Chronivac, and nothing.  He didn't even feel a stirring in his pants, and with teenage hormones, just thinking of her naked was usually enough.  Of course, she wasn't his girlfriend any more.  The new memories told him that.  She was sixteen afterall, he was thirteen.  Not exactly something she'd go for.<br />
<br />
Josh was eager as he plopped down in the chair, setting to work on their profiles.  He started altering his, and sure enough, every change he made to himself was made to his brother's profile as well.  It was kind of freaky that they were stuck this way, but Josh intended to make the most of it.  First he aged them, letting the profile adjusted some of their stats to fall in line with their new age.<br />
<br />

<br />
Obviously, they weren't going to be big guys when they got older.  25 was the perfect age though, he wanted to be completely an adult for this.  He started making other adjustments, hoping in the back of his mind that Chris wouldn't freak out too much.  He rubbed his chin as he worked.  Poking around he found other options to slide into the profile.  Some appeared only when he made them older.  Others he had to add in himself, but the program seemed to take everything into account.  He looked over the profile again.<br />

<br />
He was pretty happy with it, and he could always tweek it later.  Josh was even surprised his mind was working on that level.  Just a few minutes ago he wouldn't have thought of any of that, but add in three years and a whole hell of a lot of teenage hormones, and his mind just worked differently.  He wasn't sure about the geek/jock thing.  He wanted a bit of jockiness in him and his brother, but he didn't want to change their minds too much, leaving the geek part in.  Then to be double certain nothing would go wrong to interrupt his experiment he chose to adjust the memories of everyone but themselves.<br />
<br />
He turned to his brother who was laying on the couch, looking nervous as he watched Josh, even if he couldn't read the screen.  &quot;Ready?&quot;  Chris nodded to Josh's question, but Josh clicked OK even before his brother moved his head.<br />
<br />
The changes started right away, they were more obvious as well.  It wasn't the subtle shift of their last change, this one was much more drastic.  They were still in their clothes from before, for some reason those hadn't changed with the rest of their surroundings, like the photos.  They relatively similar size between their old bodies and their new ones had left the clothes pretty much intact.  Sure Chris' might have been a bit more snug than before, and Josh's a little looser, but it was barely noticeable.  But now Josh could see that Chris' clothes were tight on him, stretching against his skin, and he could feel his doing the same.  The brothers were watching each other with fascination.  They no longer needed mirrors, they could just watch each other and know what they looked like.<br />
<br />
Their height was the most noticable, growing taller like some invisible giant was stretching them like taffy.  Josh could see a couple inches of Chris' bared stomach between the bottom of his shirt and the waist of his pants.  A few more inches of calf stuck out of the jeans' bottom.  Even his hands and feet looked bigger.  The collar of the shirt was stretched tight from expanding shoulders.  The fabric was barely holding together.  Josh's clothes were fairing only mildly better, and only because they were bigger to start with.  Two pops sounded, one after the other as the buttons popped off first Chris' pants, then Josh's, the fly pulling open.  Chris was about to start taking off his clothes, but Josh waved him back down.  &quot;Leave it on, busting them'll be the best part.&quot;  Josh's voice cracked as he spoke, dropping an octave half way through the sentance.  He couldn't help blushing at that, puberty in fast forward.<br />
<br />
Even the hormones seemed to be working overtime.  Watching his brother changing, Josh felt a stirring in his groin, looking down to see his underwear tented through the open fly of his pants.  Though happily he saw Chris was suffering the same problem, even if he was trying to hide it behind his hands.  It wasn't working well though, their increased cock size was starting to show itself.  For better or worse, Chris was hung.<br />
<br />
Their faces lost traces of youth, their features gained a more masculine look.  Josh guessed they were inching towards Chris' old age of sixteen.  Chris' pubic bush had grown, curling over the waistband of his stretched underwear, growing up to and around his navel.  The muscles of his exposed stomach hardened, gaining a lean definition.  Even the hair on their exposed legs was becoming thicker and darker, followed shortly by their arms.  Chris' overstretched t-shirt was the first to give way, the seams tearing apart.  He pulled the scraps off his torso, exposing a muscular chest with just the faintest hint of dark hair between the pectorals and around the muscles.  The jeans didn't look like they could last much longer, the cuff just below Chris' knee and the denim strained over his more muscular legs.  The seams were spreading apart, a few stubborn threads holding them together.<br />
<br />
Josh looked down to see his clothes in the same sorry state.  He placed his hand to his stomach, rubbing his muscles and stroking his finger along his treasure trail.  His t-shirt was strained over his muscles.  He flexed as hard as he could and the fabric gave way.  Like Chris, Josh tugged off the rest of the fabric and discarded it.  Their jeans finally had enough, simultaneously ripping apart.  With nothing to keep the fabric on, they fell to the floor, leaving the twins dressed only in their underwear.  Chris in a pair of boxers that were barely holding together, and Josh in a pair of briefs that were stretched so tight you could see right through them.<br />
<br />
Josh looked up at his brother's face, tearing his eyes away from his body.  He was surprised by what he saw.  It still looked like their combined face, but it was older and more rugged.  A dark shadow had grown in along Chris' jaw and chin and along the upper lip.  Josh reached up to feel the soft fuzze stubble along his own face, but even as he stroked it, it got coarser, loosing the teenage fuzz-like quality and growing into real facial hair.<br />
<br />
As they moved past what Josh could only guess was eighteen their height slowed to a stop.  Josh kept adjusting himself in their chair, unused to the longer limbs, and Chris had stretched out his legs in front of him with a similar problem.  Their body hair had been expanding as well, the thin stripe on their stomach was about an inch wide now, and the fine downy fuzz on their chests had taken on a darker color, growing along the bottom of their pectorals as the hair in the center grew towards that around their nipples.<br />
<br />
The head of Josh's cock popped free from the waistband of his underwear, which slid down exposing most of his cock as the fabric tried to shrink back to its old size.  He hooked his finger under the waistband, letting the tormented garment drop down to his ankles, letting him kick them off.  Chris' eyes widened as he laid eyes on the ten inches of hard meat resting against Josh's stomach, and he quickly shed his boxers to get a good look at his own.  Chris ran his hand up the underside, shuddering as he did so.  His plump balls dangled off the edge of his seat, a perfect match for the large cock.  Josh ran his own hand over his cock, smiling and leaning his head back.  It felt better than he had imagined.<br />
<br />
Their changes were dramatically slowing as they moved through their twenties.  Their muscles filled out some more, going from a lean teenage physique to the hard muscles of a grown male.  They had a well defined six pack, with firm rounded pectorals.  Their arms and legs were thicker as well, each muscle easily seen under their skin.  Their body hair continued its slow spread as well, mostly on their chests were it had expanded to cover most of their pectorals, dark and thick in the middle becoming sparser towards the edge.  Josh smiled as he saw the days worth of stubble his brother was sporting, placing a hand to his cheek to feel the coarseness of his own under his fingers.  The changes creeped to a halt with a bit more of growth in their body hair and a little bit more growth to their muscular bodies.<br />
<br />
They both sat in a daze for a moment, looking at the twenty something hunk sitting across the room from them.  Chris got to his feet and looked down at himself.  He ran his hands over his body and flexed his muscles.  Pre was leaking from his cock in dribbles, landing on the floor.  Josh could feel the moistness sliding down his own shaft.  Christ finally turned to Josh, giving him a good view of his whole body.  &quot;Is this seriously how we're supposed to look older?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh just shook his head. &quot;I, uh, made a few changes.  I didn't think it'd turn out this well.&quot;  Josh stood up himself, stretching his arms over his head.<br />
<br />
Chris was still absorbd in checking out his own body.  &quot;Damn, this feels great.  But how's this supposed to convince me not to change us to bisexual?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh walked forward in a flash, wrapping his muscular arms around Chris.  He leaned in and pressed his lips against his twin's.  As turned on as he was by looking at Chris, Josh knew Chris had to feel the same way looking at him.  The Chronivac had made them essentially the same person after all.  Chris tensed at the kiss, but slowly relaxed, his own arms folding around Josh's waist as he let the kiss linger.<br />
<br />
When it finally broke, Chris gave Josh a concerned look.  &quot;This is wrong.. we're brothers.  It's incest..&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh laughed.  &quot;Incest is only bad because children come out messed up.  We're not going to have children together, I don't see the problem..&quot;  PErhaps that wasn't the only problem, but Josh's words had the desired effect on Chris.  The tension went out of his brother's muscles, he could feel Chris pushing up against him, trying to bring them as close together as possible.  Josh pulled his twin into another kiss, slowly lowering them both to the floor.  He lowered his head to his brother's cock, wrapping his mouth around the thick monster as best he could.  Slowly he began to run his tongue along the shaft, bobbing up and down as he started to suck Chris off.  After a moment Josh felt a pair of lips wrap around his own cock, a warm moistness enveloping his shaft.  He shuddered as Chris plied as much skill on Josh's cock as Josh was using on Chris'.  Twins indeed.<br />
<br />
Josh pulled away after a couple minutes of 69ing, eliciting an annoyed grunt from Chris.  Josh laid on his back, spreading his legs apart.  Chris got the hint, an excited smile forming on his face.  He stradled Josh, lowering himself till their chests just barely touched, Chris' chest hair tickling Josh's nipples.  Chris kissed Josh eagerly before sitting back up again.  Josh raised his ass off the floor, Chris helping by wrapping his arms around his twin's thighs.  He guided his saliva slicked cock towards Josh's ass, the head of his cock pushing against Josh's entrance.  Josh let out a deep gravely moan as Chris pushed a few inches of cock inside of him, spreading his ass apart.  It hurt, but an electric charge seemed to flow through Josh's muscles, making every inch pushed inside of him worth it.  He reached up and grabbed his own cock in his hand, stroking it slowly.<br />
<br />
Chris began the steady in and out motion, sliding five inches of cock out of his brother before ramming it back in.  Chris was the only one of the two to have sex before, and he seemed more than happy to take the lead.  His thrusting began slowly, but quickly picked up speed.  The arousal from first the change, and then the blowjob having already built up his climax.  This was just the finale.  Josh rubbed his cock in time to his brother's thrusts.<br />
<br />
Chris tossed his head back, letting out a deep moan as he trust one last time into Josh, a flood of semen leaving his twitching cock, filling Josh.  The sensation drove Josh over the top, his own cock jumping as it spurted thick ropes of white spunk.  Some shooting past Josh's head, some landing on his face and more dribbling onto his chest.  When the torrent of cum filling him subsided, he felt Chris pull out.  His brother rolled to the side, laying on his back on the floor next to him.  Josh dropped his ass back to the carpet.  Both their chests heaved from the quick bout of sex.  Chris turned to Josh, his deep voice slightly airy from breathlessness.  &quot;That.. was.. the best.. sex.. I've ever.. had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh smiled, knowing the effect it had on Chris now.  Chris' smiles did the same to him.  &quot;So.  Did I convince you?  We can always go again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris laughed.  &quot;Maybe you did.  Doesn't mean we can't go again anyway.&quot;  Chris sat up and looked around the room, his brow furrowed as he did so.  Josh sat up, doing the same.  He could see what confused his brother.  The room they were in didn't look like the one they were in before the change.  It was the same room in the same house.  But the furniture was all different.  Gone were his parents' things.  The furniture didn't quite match, and the entertainment center was much better than the one before.  There were few pictures on the wall, but the ones that were showed either him or his brother.  It was impossible to tell which, but somehow he knew, the fake memories coming to the surface as he needed them.  Various movie posters and sports stuff decorated the wall.  The place looked like, for lack of a better term, a bachelor pad.  Chris managed a faint grunt.  &quot;Guess we live alone here, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris managed another smile as he looked at the computer.  &quot;I think it's my turn now.&quot;</p>
