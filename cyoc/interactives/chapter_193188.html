<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I then wished that the woman that was in front of me would every time she starts to regress and that reality would change to her new age and that she would stop regressing  when she is 3 months old and if she regressed to 3 months who every she is with will become her family member. He added that she will regress for every nasty remark or body jesters she will regress 1/2 a year each time.<br />
<br />
Joey decided he would check on her later on before it got to late. He then adds that he will be able to know each time she regresses.<br />
<br />
He then noticed one of the teachers that he had while he was a eight grade student. She is about 32 and very beautiful and remembered her name is Lisa. He then wished under his breath for her clothing to disappear which they did which she started to scream as she was going in front of a alley way. So he goes over and offers her his jacket. She then stops screaming and Joey wished that everyone but the teacher and him would forget she had ever been nude.<br />
<br />
Joey then asked her if he could walk her someplace? She then says that she had been heading to the store before any of this started. Joey suggest that it might be smarter to have her go back home and get dressed again, she then says that she can&#39;t because when her clothing disappeared so didn&#39;t her purse. I then says that my mom might be her size.<br />
<br />
You make it back to your place and you tell her to wait in your room. You go to your parents room and bring her back you mother&#39;s robe. And then hands it to her and says he will take and look for some other things for her.<br />
<br />
What Joey didn&#39;t realize but she did was that he had a slight erection. So she had asked Joey if he thought she was beautiful. Joey says yes and then asked why she had asked. Which she says that she could tell because of your erection.  She then asked if he wanted to have sex with her. Joey says yes and then she takes and removes the robe and Joey sees that she is pregnant which she is 5 months along. <br />
 <br />
She then says that her husband since I got pregnant hasn&#39;t wanted to have sex and has been working later and later now a days. Joey then says that it sounds like her husband might be having a affair and she agrees.<br />
<br />
They had sex and Lisa tells Joey that he was the best, and that any girl should be thankful to have him as a boyfriend. Joey then asked Lisa what she would want to do to her husband to punish him if he is having a affair.<br />
<br />
She then says that if it would be possible for him and the woman he having the affair with would swap groin&#39;s and that they would stay that way until they have sex again. Joey then says that he got&#39;s another suggestion for that saying that because with you being pregnant that when they have sex they will switch groins and that her husband will also swap with the woman time of the month and could also possible get pregnant. She says that she wants to have that done. <br />
<br />
Joey knows that Karen has gone from being 30 to now being 22. Joey then wished that her clothing would be found in a alley. He then asked if she wanted to take a shower before they head to her place. Joey then wished that she would remember that she had a spare key in a hiding place.<br />
<br />
Lisa says yes and then he wishes while she is taking a shower  for a set of clothing that would fit her along with a bra and panty with the tags still on them.<br />
<br />
just as she was getting out of the shower they hear his parents car pull in and Joey wishes that they would not see her as one of his old teacher but a student. So when they leave his room all his parents see is a girl about Joey age and asked what they are up to. Joey said that she goes to school with him that he was walking her home after some of the other male students had tried to rape her but that he had saved her. He then added that the school had already been told and that I let her use our shower to get cleaned up and had let her borrow your robe mom so I could wash up her clothing.</p>
