<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike&#39;s panic grew as he looked at his smaller, less imposing body. The realization that his son was now older and he, himself, had regressed to a child was overwhelming. His heart raced as he stuttered, &quot;Chris, we need to fix this... now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing his father&#39;s distress, Chris knew he had to act quickly. Without hesitation, he grabbed the device and turned it on himself. The familiar glow surrounded him, and in an instant, he felt a rush of energy coursing through his veins. He closed his eyes for a moment, bracing himself for the changes he was about to experience.<br />
<br />
As the transformation took hold, Chris felt his body stretching, growing taller and more muscular. His limbs elongated, and he could practically feel the muscles developing and expanding beneath his skin. He stood there, his shirt feeling tighter and tighter against his chest as his muscles swelled to an impressive size. The fabric strained, and with a loud rip, his shirt burst open, revealing his now-powerful physique.<br />
<br />
His chest broadened, his biceps bulged, and his abs became chiseled and defined. Chris was experiencing a rapid transformation from teenage boy to fully grown man. His voice deepened as he continued to grow, his legs becoming thicker and more powerful. With each passing moment, he could feel the surge of strength and confidence coursing through his body.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the growth began to slow, and Chris stood there, shirtless and towering over his father. His muscular frame was a testament to his newfound adulthood. He looked down at Mike, a smug grin on his face, fully aware of the contrast between their sizes. &quot;Well, Dad, looks like I&#39;m the one in charge now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s shock was evident as he gazed up at his now-grown son, his voice a mixture of surprise and disbelief, &quot;Chris... you&#39;ve turned into a... man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris flexed his biceps, his muscles rippling with power. &quot;Yep, Dad. And now that I&#39;m in control of this device, things are going to be a little different around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stammered, struggling to process the situation. &quot;But... how did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled, enjoying his newfound dominance. &quot;I guess you could say I took matters into my own hands, or rather, my own remote.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s eyes widened as he looked at the device in Chris&#39;s hand, the power it held now abundantly clear. &quot;You can&#39;t keep me like this, Chris. Change me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris smirked, a glint of mischief in his eyes. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, Dad. I&#39;ll change you back eventually. But first, you&#39;re going to learn what it&#39;s like to be in my shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mike grappled with the reality of his predicament, he realized that the roles had been reversed in a way he couldn&#39;t have imagined. His towering, muscular son now held the key to his transformation, and he was at Chris&#39;s mercy.<br />
<br />
With a triumphant grin, Chris patted his father&#39;s now-petite shoulder, his voice dripping with authority, &quot;Welcome to my world, Dad. It&#39;s time for you to see things from a different perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the days that followed the unexpected role reversal, Chris wasted no time in asserting his newfound authority. He treated Mike like a kid, making him do chores and listen to his instructions for a change. Mike begrudgingly followed along, a constant reminder of his diminished state.<br />
<br />
One night, as Mike stood before the mirror, he flexed his small arms, still struggling to come to terms with the reality of his transformation. He sighed deeply, lost in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Chris happened to pass by Mike&#39;s room and noticed his father&#39;s reflective stance. Intrigued, he entered the room, a confident grin spreading across his face. &quot;Dad, still trying to flex those little muscles of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike looked at Chris, a mixture of annoyance and longing in his eyes. He started to retort, but Chris didn&#39;t give him a chance. With a swift motion, Chris took off his shirt, revealing a chiseled chest, broad shoulders, and powerful arms. He struck a pose, mocking Mike&#39;s lack of strength. &quot;Now this,&quot; Chris taunted, &quot;is what real muscles look like, Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s frustration grew, but he remained silent, unable to deny the contrast between his current state and his son&#39;s impressive physique.<br />
<br />
But Chris wasn&#39;t done poking fun. With a mischievous twinkle in his eye, he flexed his pectoral muscles, making them dance rhythmically. Mike watched in disbelief, both impressed and irked by his son&#39;s display.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Dad,&quot; Chris chortled, &quot;I can do things you could only dream of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s patience wore thin, and he retorted, &quot;Alright, Chris, that&#39;s enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris, however, wasn&#39;t ready to stop. He saw an opportunity for more amusement. With a confident smirk, he walked over to his father and, in a surprising show of strength, lifted Mike up effortlessly. Mike&#39;s feet dangled in the air as Chris chuckled, &quot;How&#39;s the view from up here, little guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s face turned red with a mixture of embarrassment and frustration. &quot;Chris, put me down!&quot;<br />
<br />
Still laughing, Chris didn&#39;t comply right away. Instead, he held Mike above his head, showcasing his own muscular prowess. &quot;You see, Dad, being in charge has its perks. I get to call the shots now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, with another chuckle, Chris lowered Mike back to the ground. Mike stood there, his small frame still processing the unexpected experience. Chris&#39;s amusement was evident as he patted his father&#39;s shoulder, his tone condescending, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Dad. Maybe someday you&#39;ll grow back into your big, strong self.&quot;</p>
