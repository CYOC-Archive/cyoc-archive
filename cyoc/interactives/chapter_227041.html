<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day five of the transition of becoming Santa and Jeff wasn&#39;t thinking about it.  Instead, all he&#39;s thinking about is the date with Christine.  It is the only though he could think of when he&#39;s in bed and was turned on at the thought of making out with her.  Even his big &#39;little&#39; buddy was erect just thinking about it and could feel himself going to cum if he hadn&#39;t calmed down.  Once the morning came, he took a good look at himself in the mirror to make sure that no sign of aging was being shown.<br />
<br />
All ready, he could see his 28-year-old self looked the same as ever.  Despite the growing of more hair on his body, arms, and legs and the growing beard spreading across her face, he still looked like the same buffs guy he had seen the first couple of days.<br />
<br />
Seeing himself, he smirked and said, &quot;So far so good.  Looks like I still have the bod for now.  Though I get the feeling by tomorrow, I will be loosing his body slow and steady.  Let&#39;s hope this date doesn&#39;t end in a disaster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once he took a shower and put on some new clothes, he went for breakfast to eat more food then that of his family.  The mother soon said to Jeff that she&#39;ll big up his little sister up since he will be on that date.  Jeff was relieved that he won&#39;t have to worry about that.  But there will be the problem on how the date will end.  Will he be back home, or something else will happen.  Only time will tell.  After breakfast, he took the bus with his sister and dropped her off from school before getting into town to begin working.<br />
<br />
Throughout the day, he was doing the same as ever, stacking shelves, taking inventory, and helping customers looking for their own products.  But in his head, Jeff couldn&#39;t stop thinking of how the date will go.  At lunch, he soon started to contemplate if he would go on this date or not giving his slowly aging body.  Already, he is twenty-nine and soon will be pushing thirty.  As he was thinking...<br />
<br />
&quot;Still getting stocked on our date, tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, he looked up to see Christine standing there with her lunch in hand, looking more radiant with and outfit that looked a bit too revealing.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on and turned away, trying to hide his awkwardness.  &quot;Uh...  I guess...  But don&#39;t you think we are taking things too quick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine sat across the way to Jeff and gave him an odd look.  &quot;Why not.  Out of all the guys around here, you are the hottest of them all.  I really want to get to know you  is all.  And besides, who has a big slab of meat like yours?&quot; she said as she gently place her knee to his package under the table, causing it to stir.<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel that and blushed a little.  &quot;Still, I feel like it&#39;s a little early to go straight on a date.  Maybe we should slow down before we ramp things up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And miss my chance at some action?  No way!&quot; she rebutted, &quot;After all, when&#39;s a chance to find someone as stack as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lunch was a bit long and awkward for Jeff as he was sitting across to Christine.  Thankfully, she was finished with her meal and got up to say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m off to the make up counter.  See you tonight, lover boy.&quot;  She soon turned around and walked away as she sway her hips to give Jeff a taste of what&#39;s to come.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on and gave a deep groan, munching on his second sandwich.  &quot;Why did I get round up into this mess?&quot;<br />
<br />
Once lunch was over, Jeff spent the rest of the way stocking up shelves and checking inventory.  But in his mind, he gets worried about this date and how it will go.  After all, he just met her and they are going right on a date.  When was that a thing?  Regardless, he hope it was just a quick dinner and that&#39;s it.  Otherwise it could get to extreme, especially since the more he thought about it, the more his friend continues to get stiff from time to time.<br />
<br />
After five, Jeff wrapped up and didn&#39;t see Christine around.  At first, she must&#39;ve gave up and he was in the clear.  But as he left the store front, he saw someone he didn&#39;t expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are...  Got worried about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing before him is Christine with her arms crossed under her breasts.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on and tries to clear his throat.  &quot;I...  I was busy with work.  Need to make sure all the boxes are checked and ready for restock, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine placed her hands on her hips and gave a sly smile.  &quot;Uh-huh...  Sure...  Come on, let&#39;s go.  I know this nice bar around here that has the best burgers and beer.  Oh, and don&#39;t worry about money, it&#39;s on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon walked away and swayed her hips back and forth to please Jeff.  He looked on and gave a sigh, hoping nothing could go wrong.<br />
<br />
At the bar, Jeff and Christine were sitting across the table from each other, as they were enjoying their meals.  While Christine had a simple Cesar salad with a tall glass of Long Island tea, Jeff has two meat burgers with a side of fries with ketchup and a large beer.<br />
<br />
Christine looked to him and was a little concerned about his eating habits.  &quot;You know... I find it funny that you keep eating more food then a normal person.  But for some reason you still keep eating even after lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged it off and said to her, &quot;What more can I say, I guess I have a much stronger metabolism.&quot;  He didn&#39;t feel like he was in the mood for the date, fearing how bad it will go.<br />
<br />
As they were enjoying themselves, a group of college frat boys in Santa costumes walked up to the bar and asked for some beer, laughing it up and joking around.  Christine looked back to the group and gave a deep grown.  &quot;Argh...  Boys...  All dressed up like that for a silly Santa Run and act like it&#39;s fun.  Damn bastards.  they don&#39;t know anything about what Christmas and Santa was really about.&quot; she soon took a sip of her tea.<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed that and was a little curious about that.  &quot;So...  You don&#39;t like the way Christmas is represented, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine eat her salad and gave a deep sigh.  &quot;You could say that...  Growing up, Christmas is about many things.  The birth of Christ, Santa Clause, spending time with family, gift giving, the whole ten yards.  Now a days, it&#39;s all about marketing and capitalism.  People now see Santa is a big fat man dressed in a red suit.  They care less about religions and more into posting their insane tree and house decorations on Tik Tok.  And presents?  Ha!  Now people give nothing but gift cards.  Gift cards!  What is the problem in giving actual gifts then cards filled with cash were people by their own.  Really ruin the surprise, you got me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff listened to her grief and knew what she means.  Christmas was once a festive occasion.  Now a days, it&#39;s nothing then another day of spending and greed.  People never care of the true meaning of Christmas, the story behind it, or the legend of Santa.  That&#39;s why he is using the Chronivac to do the slow change of Santa Clause, to bring back the holiday spirit.  But hearing what she said, he couldn&#39;t help but to feel sorry for her.<br />
<br />
After a bit of silence, he looked up to Christine and said, &quot;I know it.  I was a young kid growing up when Christmas was all about the true meaning behind it.  Now, unfortunately, people don&#39;t care about the meaning.  They use the day as an excuse to get drunk while wearing Santa get ups, ugly sweaters, and constant spending on piece of plastics.  I feel you.  Sometimes, people need to stop acting like a bunch of pricks and understand what Christmas is truly about.  Spending time with those you love and reminiscing on the past year.  And yes, while Santa does seem to be played out now, back then, he was just someone we grew up idolizing.  Even I myself wish I could be him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine heard him and did a double take when he mentioned that said statement.  &quot;Shut up!  You kidding me!  You want to be Santa?  That seems like a reach.  I mean, look at him and look at you.  The both of you are polar opposites, so there&#39;s no way for you to complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down and he knew that she had a point.  But that would all soon change as he knew by tomorrow, aging will crawl up to him soon.  &quot;Maybe your right.  But you may never know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hours pass as they were eating and laughing the night away.  Already, Jeff was liking how things are going.  It&#39;s just a normal dinner date and nothing too far.  Although it would seem that Christine had a few of the Ice Tea filled with vodka.  So far, she&#39;s already tipsy and looked like she was in a cloudy haze.<br />
<br />
Jeff could see that and said to her, &quot;You know, I think it&#39;s time I take you to your place.  You look like you are going to pass out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine was a little whoozy and said in a slur voice, &quot;What are you talking about?  I&#39;m fine.  Look.  I can stand on my own.&quot;  She soon started to stand up and was trying to hold her own.  But she soon stumbled and was about to fall to the floor.  Jeff immediately reacted by catching her before she falls face first, but only to have his hand on her breast.  She felt that and was a little flustered.  &quot;Oh, Jeffy...  I didn&#39;t think you can go right to second base.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt that and was blushing red, but in all the wrong reasons.  He could already feel his sausage beginning to rise upwards and he needs to diffuse the situation.  &quot;Uh...  I&#39;ll call a taxi and take you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the food was paid, she left the bar and Jeff called the cab.  Once he got both of them in, they drove up to her place with her giving out the address.  Once they arrived and Jeff paid for the fare, he escorted her into her loft and placed her on the sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now just rest here and I&#39;ll go get a glass of water for you.&quot; he told her.<br />
<br />
Christine looked to him with hazy eyes and said, &quot;Of course Jeffy...   I&#39;m thirsty...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jeff approached the kitchen and got a glass filled with water.  As he was getting the cup ready, he looked up to the reflection of the mirror.  He could tell that he was already thirty and he could see his face was still looking good with the facial hair growing around his mouth and his side burns were descending downwards.  He could tell that he was getting the beard he needed to become Santa, but it will be a while until then.  While he still has clothes on him, he could still tell that he was strong hunk but until tomorrow, he will start to go over the hill soon.<br />
<br />
Once he was done filling the glass up, he returned to her and said, &quot;Here&#39;s your water.  Sorry it took so long, this is the first time in your place and I had no idea where...&quot;<br />
<br />
He soon stopped what he was saying and was shocked to see what he&#39;s looking at.  Christine was on the sofa, but she was half landed with her clothes on the floor, dressed in nothing but a bar and panties.  Jeff dropped the glass of water and let it shatter to the floor with the liquid spilling out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christine!  What are you doing?&quot; he asked in shock.<br />
<br />
She looked at him devilishly and said, &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious.  I&#39;m thirsty  and I need something to drink.  Care to join me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on and didn&#39;t know what to think.  &quot;Ugh...  That&#39;s nice...  But I think you&#39;re still a little drunk.  Maybe it&#39;s best that I take you to bed to rest your head or something.  I can-&quot;<br />
<br />
But she lunged at him and grabbed him by the shirt collar.  &quot;Come on sweetie.  Give me a drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, she kissed him on the lips and planed it deep into him.  Jeff was caught by surprise and wanted to get her of of him.  But when the kiss lasted, he was giving up the fight and accepted the kiss.  Soon enough, the two went down on the sofa and and grope each other.  Surrendering to it, Jeff let Christine take of his shirt and saw his muscular body that has more hair then expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...  who would&#39;ve thought that you were quite the bear.&quot; she said in awe.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled and said back to her, &quot;What can I say...  I have a jungle that you need to journey into.  Escpecially down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she immediately removed his pants and under ware and saw the sight to be hold.  Jeff&#39;s own penis, looking huge and meaty.  Seeing that, she licked her lips and said, &quot;Damn...  That is huge and juicy.&quot;  She soon started to rub on it hard, letting it go erect and grew a foot tall.  &quot;Let&#39;s see how it taste like.&quot;  And with that, she placed her mouth into the dick and sucked on it like a lollipop.<br />
<br />
Jeff was feeling it as he was groaning from the ecstacy.  She soon stopped what she was doing and decided to take it to the next level.  &quot;You know what, why do I need to suck on it when I could ride on it.&quot;  With that, she took off her bra and panties and she too was naked.  She soon was on top of Jeff and got into a position.<br />
<br />
They looked at each other with loving eyes and knew that they were ready to to take it to the next level.  &quot;You ready Jeffy?&quot; Christine asked her.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on, forgetting completely about fighting her off.  &quot;Whenever you are, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the two gave each other a deep and passionate kiss while at the same time, Christine slid her pussy into Jeff&#39;s dick.  The movements started to slow at first as they were kissing.  But the movements were starting to quicken.  They soon stop kissing as Christine continued to move her body up and down harder with her boobs bouncing and ass giggling.  The pace was quickening and the two continued to work hard.  Their moans escaped their lips as they grew louder and louder.  So much so that it only took a few minutes before they screamed in climax as Jeff cummed into Christine.<br />
<br />
For what was just a normal first date, turned into something else as Jeff accepted it and has an official girl to call his own.  What a night...<br />
<br />
Back at Jeff&#39;s house, his computer was still humming in his room as the Chronivac was still working on turning him into Santa.  But then, there was a new message as it said...<br />
<br />
&quot;Attention: New paramaters set.  Preparing adjustments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, a new set of information was set.  The first set was soon set to a new person, Jeff&#39;s new girlfriend.<br />
