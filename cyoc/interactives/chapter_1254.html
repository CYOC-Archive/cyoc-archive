<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul could barely contain his excitement as he pulled into work a little late.  He pulled out the wand, &quot;I wish no one would ever notice me being late to anything again,&quot; he said with a big grin.  The wand wouldn't really fit in any of his pockets, so he decided to leave it in the car.
<br>

<br>
Nobody mentioned his late arrival, and he was assigned a job he could do by himself for the morning.  He smiled and tried to notice if the foreman had shrunk any, but their meeting was brief and then he was off to a part of the site where no one else was working.  
<br>

<br>
He waited impatiently for lunchtime.  He was impatient to let his balls start shrinking some of the guys -- just like they'd done to Jim Laird this morning -- but decided that waiting would make it all the more exciting when it started.  He even knocked off a little early when he saw guys starting to gather in the parking lot and around the 'fridge.
<br>

<br>
He picked a table where several guys were already sitting, and pulled up a chair.  They were all guys that he'd worked with on different jobs before -- Larry, Tom, and Chris.  Unwrapping his sandwich, he listened to Larry talk about some problem with his car.  A minute passed, and Paul watched to see any changes in any of the guys, but nothing so far.  Trying to escalate the situation, he stood up and made some excuse to go over to the fridge again.  Coming back to the table, he stood behind Larry and to one side.
<br>

<br>
It was at that point that Paul noticed he seemed to have a lot more sandwich than usual.  He looked at it closely, and then looked back at Larry, who hadn't been paying much attention to Paul anyway.  Larry didn't seem a bit smaller.  In fact, he seemed larger.  Paul realized he had been so busy waiting for the other guys to shrink that he hadn't noticed his own loss of inches.
<br>

<br>
Setting his food down, Paul rushed out to his car.  There were a bunch of guys hanging around it, just talking and having lunch.  Thinking that he wasn't ready to deal with that quite yet, he veered over to the portable toilets that were lined up.  He noticed that Steve was just getting in to one of them, so he jumped in the other one.
<br>

<br>
Yanking down his pants, he saw his massive genitals were greatly diminished.  They looked oddly deflated and small, attached to his hairy body.  He grabbed them in his hand and felt their weight.  How had he not noticed them shrinking?  When did it happen?
<br>

<br>
Paul pulled up his pants, and felt their looseness.  Just standing there, he had continued to shrink!  He had to get that wand back and undo this mess.  Not wanting to attract attention to himself by running, he walked as quickly as he could out of the toilet.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Hey, Paul!&quot; Steve said, coming out of the toilet right next to his.  Steve was probably the guy at the site that Paul knew the best, and they often hung out together.  But right now, Paul was not in the mood to see anyone.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Hey Steve,&quot; Paul said, &quot;I'm in a hurry right now.  Let's talk later.&quot;
<br>

<br>
&quot;It's OK,&quot; Steve said, pulling up right next to Paul as the shorter man walked quickly to the parking lot.  &quot;I'll walk with you.&quot;  The walk was short, but Paul really didn't pay attention to anything Steve said after that.  He only had eyes for Steve's shoes which had grown a little bigger with each step.
<br>

<br>
Finally, Paul reached his car and said, &quot;Hang on a minute, Steve.&quot;  Reaching in side, he rummaged around for the wand under the driver's seat.  There were people everywhere, so he didn't dare take it out in plain sight.
<br>

<br>
Quietly, he said, &quot;I wish my balls were back to their original, big size.&quot;  Then he breathed out.  Steve stepped around the driver's door and offered to help Paul fish out whatever he was trying to get.  Paul shuddered as he felt Steve brush the car.  He was still losing inches!
<br>

<br>
Trying to change strategies, he said, &quot;I wish I stopped shrinking and was immediately returned to my full height.&quot;  Again, nothing happened, but a little more shrinking.  &quot;Fuck!&quot; Paul said loudly.
<br>

<br>
Steve had noticed that Paul was acting strangely, and now he noticed that Paul was looking kinda strange too.  Paul's clothes seemed too big and baggy on his body.</p>
