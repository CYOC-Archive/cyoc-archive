<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waking as the sun now began to brighten Sparks room, Rei and Nat stretched rubbing the sleep from their eyes. &quot;What time is it,&quot; they asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven,&quot; Spark said quickly. The two teens now blinked, glancing towards the fairy. Spark appeared flustered, fidgeting with her dress in annoyance. &quot;Star this dress is too big!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shouldn&#39;t be,&quot; she replied, the orange fairy poking her head in. &quot;I mean I know what your size is and its never been worn. Why would it be too large?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its sized for adult me not teen me,&quot; Spark replied in annoyance. Star, Rei, and Nat now watched as the fairy now motioned to her breasts and hips, a sour look crossing her face. &quot;I&#39;ve lost some curve and some cup sizes since then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not my fault your nickname was bee sting when we were kids,&quot; Star replied, the older sister smirking as she pointed to Sparks small B cup breasts. Spark frowned, tossing a hairbrush at her sister before flipping her off. &quot;Bitch,&quot; she grumbled. Turning to Rei and Nat, her shoulders now slumped in annoyance. &quot;Can you guys give me a hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei nodded, raising her ring as she concentrated on Sparks dress.  Rei hadn&#39;t used to ring to alter someone&#39;s clothing before (at least consciously) so this would be a challenge. Furrowing her brow she now stared intently at Sparks dress.<br />
<br />
Spark sighed in relief, watching as the material now began to contract around her lithe teenage body. Sparks bust line contracting around her small perky breasts as the waist now cinched around her narrow hips. In only seconds the fairies dress became form fitting, accentuating her teenage figure. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Spark smiled in relief.<br />
<br />
Rei smiled, appreciating the compliment as she now jotted down the spell in her book. This one was definitely a keeper as far as she was concerned.<br />
<br />
After finishing breakfast and dressing the group now made their way to the fairies palace. Rei and Nat gazing in wonder at the home of Queen Glitter. The palace was magnificent, white marble stone seemingly built into an expansive oak tree. As they now approached, the group couldn&#39;t help but marvel at the beauty of the masonry work as well as the statues that adorned the castle. &quot;This place is gorgeous,&quot; Miranda whispered in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait til you see the throne room,&quot; Star smirked. The others simply nodded, slowly filing behind the orange fairy. As the group now reached a large set of oak doors, Nova paused as she now addressed her daughters and her friends. &quot;Before we enter I just want to set some ground rules,&quot; she said. &quot;Queen Glitter has had contact with humans before, both good and bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes met humans before,&quot; Rei asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nova replied. &quot;I&#39;ll let her tell the story. Needless to say, she does have an understanding of human behavior. That&#39;s why I am sure she will be happy to see you.&quot;Nova now turned to Spark and Star, her eyes narrowing as she stared at her two daughters. &quot;And it also means you need to be on your best behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you looking at me,&quot; Star exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And me,&quot; Spark added. &quot;I&#39;m just as nervous about meeting her as the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you two have a bad habit of fighting with one another,&quot; Nova stated. &quot;You two have always tried to one up eachother. One moment you get along perfectly well. The next, you act like your in a blood feud. You two are to be on your best behavior is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fairy siblings both agreed, sighing in annoyance as Nova smiled. As she turned to open the door though, both Star and Spark took the final opportunity to make faces at one another before meeting Queen Glitter. They understood that at least temporarily they would need to quell their competitive fire.<br />
<br />
As the door swung open, the teens now gasped in awe at what they saw. The room was illuminated by a large picture window, vast vegetation spreading out as far as the eye could see with plenty of sunlight to illuminate the white marble walls. Towards the rear, the teens beheld a massive throne made of oak and gold, gems embedded in its frame that shimmered in the sunlight while a marble staircase led to the marble floor below. All the teens could do was simply marvel at its beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat look,&quot; Rei whispered, gesturing towards a portrait. Nat paused, following her girlfriends gesture as she beheld a rather off oil painting. Approaching slowly she was puzzled by what she saw.<br />
<br />
The oil painting appeared to be Queen Glitter, yet it was somewhat odd. The fairy queen was dressed in purple workout attire, her hair a short brown bobcut. The face was that of the Queen, yet their was something almost cartoonish about its appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they certainly butchered my appearance on that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teens jumped, spinning in place as they beheld an elegantly dressed fairy with shoulder length sandy brown hair. &quot;Queen Glitter,&quot; they asked.<br />
<br />
Glitter smiled, taking a small bow as she now approached. Rei and Nat taken aback by her appearance. Unlike the other fairies they had met, Glitter possessed a flesh tone, appearing very much like a movie star in her regal gown. Taking a closer look they could see the fairy queen possessed bright purple eyes that shone like to gems. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had this painted from an animation sheet,&quot; she stated. &quot;Kind of a reminder of my time when I helped a group of human teenagers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you saved humans,&quot; Nat asked in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly did,&quot; Glitter smiled. &quot;It was the late 60s or perhaps the early 70s. A group of teenagers accidentally entered our domain thanks to  the reckless spell of an evil scientist who fancied himself a wizard. I helped those teenagers return home and banish that scientist. It turns out years later one of those teens worked as an animator. He used our story to make a Saturday morning cartoon in the 1980s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously,&quot; Rei exclaimed, to which Glitter nodded.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;Although I must say I certainly dressed better than my cartoon counterpart but, they did a fantastic job in making me cute.&quot; Glitter now turned to the others, watching Nova and her family bow before her respectfully. &quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; she said. &quot;When I heard about Spark and Connor I just had to meet them. Our people don&#39;t often come in contact with humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a pleasure to serve you your grace,&quot; Star stated, bowing before the queen. Glitter smiled, chuckling softly due to Stars formality. &quot;Please follow me to my balcony.&quot; The others followed behind, exiting out of the throne room to a magnificent marble balcony. Rei and Nat gaped, shocked to see the structure supported by the branch of an oak tree, overlooking a magnificent garden of flowers. As the group now took a seat on hand carved wooden chairs, Glitter now beckoned for a servant. &quot;Please retrieve some drinks for my guests,&quot; she stated, before turning to the teens. &quot;Soda am I right? I seem to remember teenagers loving soda. Something about the syrupy goodness and sugar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds  good your highness,&quot; Miles stated, the teen somewhat flummoxed as he bowed. &quot;Umm you said you actually saved humans before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes years ago,&quot; she said. &quot;Those teenagers were some of the greatest beings I&#39;ve ever known. The scientist tbough? Well, I didn&#39;t like him very much at all. But enough about me, Spark. Connor. Care to explain?&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark and Connor now nervously looked at one another before looking to Queen Glitter. Despite the serene and peaceful look on her face, Spark was nervous about what she would say about her relationship. &quot;Well your highness,&quot; Spark stammered, fidgeting under the queens gaze. &quot;As you know I&#39;ve been in the Moreland families employ for years now. I only recently began dating Connor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glitter nodded, studying the two teens carefully. Spark fidgeted nervously under the queens gaze, feeling as if the fairy was peering into her very soul. &quot;Tell me Spark,&quot; she asked. &quot;When did you dance with Connor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dance,&quot; she asked, somewhat perplexed. Spark wasn&#39;t sure what Glitter meant, in her anxious state she couldn&#39;t remember. Suddenly, like a bolt of lightning it hit her.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH SHIT the dance!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark,&quot; Nova exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Spark replied sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark what is it,&quot; Connor asked. &quot;What dance?&quot; Spark now gazed at Connor, her cheeks burning in embarrassment. Why hadn&#39;t she thought about it before? Why hadn&#39;t she thought of it then? It explained everything. Her feelings for Connor, her body regressing. It all was connected to that one innocent dance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm Connor,&quot; she said sheepishly. &quot;Remember that dance we went to last December?&quot; Connor tilted his head, unsure what she was getting at before his eyes went wide. &quot;Yeah I remember,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can someone clue us in,&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help answer that,&quot; Glitter smiled. &quot;You see rather unknowingly your friends here performed the rite of spring. It explains why the two of them have connected so deeply.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark performed the rite of spring,&quot; Star and Nova gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait that dance her parents showed us yesterday,&quot; Nat exclaimed. &quot;When?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At a dance last year,&quot; Spark groaned. &quot;Shit, I hadn&#39;t even thought about that! But, it does explain everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait so are we like married then,&quot; Connor asked in alarm. Spark now blushed, casting a shy glance up at her boyfriend before answering. &quot;Sort of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not legally,&quot; Glitter said quickly. &quot;But the two of you have bonded on a spiritual level. I suppose congratulations are in order. I look forward to attending your wedding, when you two are both much older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark and Connor now simply gaped at one another, both surprised to find that one little dance had essentially bonded them for life. It was now Spark who turned to Glitter, an anxious look on her face. &quot;So you approve?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve always liked humans and seeing as how you two have bonded on a spiritual level, it would be cruel to separate you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective sigh of relief now escaped Spark and Connors lips, the duo exchanging a a small kiss as they gazed into eachothers eyes. For better or worse the two would be with eachother for the rest of their days.</p>
