<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liam went to the bathroom and started writing things down on a concealed notepad. It seemed like Charlie really was becoming...different. A lot different. Not just in body, but in mentality. The man Liam remembered as perhaps overly masculine had become more effete. Not that there was anything wrong with that, but it was a very obvious change in the man that hinted at some possible neurological effects in addition to whatever else was going on here. He needed to look into whoever was responsible for this drug and how it was they were able to give it all these different effects.<br />
<br />
By the time Liam got back to the table, he noticed that the waitress was attending the table. And Charlie just looked gobsmacked.<br />
<br />
Liam admitted he had thought the drug might&#39;ve had some sexuality bending effects, but maybe instead it just made people more...flexible, shall we say. Charlie sputtered and said, &quot;I---I uh, thanks Michelle, we&#39;ll just uh...we&#39;ll just have waters and the garlic fish entree.&quot; As Liam took his seat, Charlie realized he must&#39;ve seen that and blushed, &quot;I...do hope that you don&#39;t think I&#39;m some overexcited kid now, Mister Officer. You gotta understand, Michelle&#39;s so...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hot, right? Damn she&#39;s got a nice ass.&quot; Liam had a girlfriend, so he wasn&#39;t exactly gonna make a move on the waitress. But he could appreciate a nice ass when he saw one.<br />
<br />
Charlie&#39;s eyes were immediately on her ass as she sashayed and moved around between tables, taking orders. She definitely knew what she had and more than owned it. Liam watched the former bodybuilder seeming to sweat a bit as he watched the woman moving around. A slightly sharper canine was bared as Charlie very lightly bit his lip, and Liam swore he saw a tiny bit more of Charlie&#39;s hair trend more toward that strange orange-ish color.<br />
<br />
Charlie tried to sit in place as Liam asked him, &quot;So, how&#39;re you feeling after that workout today? Looked like it was pretty rough...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you know...mmph...I&#39;m fine. Really. Just gotta get used to my...my body...having some different---oh.&quot; Charlie squirmed in his seat and awkwardly tried to adjust himself. Liam knew the guy was probably adjusting his dick. He could recognize the way the rich son was moving around.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure? I mean, you&#39;re definitely looking a bit smaller than usual.&quot; Liam outright said it.<br />
<br />
Charlie gulped, sighed, and tried to deflect the line of questioning, &quot;You&#39;ve...got a really nice tan, Mister uhh, Mister Officer...&quot; He breathed heavily, obviously trying to keep himself from acting up in some way, &quot;Where&#39;d you get it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanning myself out front. I&#39;m not exactly a shy man. I&#39;ve got a great body, so I show it off out front of my house on a towel.&quot; Liam figured the mental imagery might cause something to happen. He didn&#39;t expect a groan that almost sounded like a yowl of some sort. His head tilted as he watched Charlie grip the sides of his seat, choking down a moan.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Charlie looked up at him, intense, and said in a low tone, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back. I gotta---gotta uhh, the bathroom! Gotta use the bathroom!&quot; With that, Liam watched Charlie hurry off into the restroom, almost bumping into a few patrons in his hurried rush to the bathroom. And Liam swore, did he see some sort of impression in the back of Charlie&#39;s shorts...? Nah, probably just the way things looked right now.<br />
<br />
As Charlie got into the bathroom, he just as quickly hurried into one of the large stalls usually reserved for people on some form of disability. He didn&#39;t really care. He needed the room. Charlie locked the door behind him and groaned, &quot;Doesn&#39;t...doesn&#39;t he KNOW what doing that---saying that---will do to me!?&quot; Charlie hurriedly pulled his shorts down and revealed his newly thin and very sensitive cock.<br />
<br />
Charlie was well aware it should be thicker, but as he wrapped a hand around it he could only barely stop himself from moaning outright.<br />
<br />
Fuck, but he loved how it felt. Sure it was less big but---maybe he was just trading a bigger manhood for one that---ohh, felt so much better and more responsive. Charlie started trying to rub his hand over it and he felt something wiggling near his rear. Barely there, but he could tell it was SOMETHING. However, right now Charlie had so much more he was concerned with in the stall. His cock. His body, still responding so heavily to stimuli...<br />
<br />
For some reason his nails seemed slightly sharper, so he needed to handle his manhood with greater care.<br />
<br />
He swore that his teeth seemed a little sharper than they usually were. And for some reason the idea of fish really got him excited. Almost on a deeply inlaid level.<br />
<br />
And fuck, why was he itching so much on his chest and stomach...? Charlie needed to get this masturbation taken care of before Liam thought something might be going on. He needed to...to try and seem more masculine around Mister Officer. Maybe if he took care of himself now, he could---he could try and impress Liam more once he was done. That might work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh yes...Michelle is so fucking hot...and so&#39;s Liam...&quot; The fantasies Charlie indulged in were at once familiar but completely different - finding himself thinking of both Liam and Michelle the waitress servicing him. Their mouths on his manhood. Oh it could just make him yowl with pleasure...!</p>
