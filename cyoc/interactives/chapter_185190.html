(Adding this to give an RPG feel and keep track of character intros and changes. I&#39;m basing this version of kitsune on Pathfinder, loosely. And I vaguely seem to recall &quot;courtesan&quot; being an actual class in some story-driven RPG, though I don&#39;t suppose it matters if it ever actually was.)<br/>
<br/>
This is a long epic, and feedback is appreciated! Comments can be posted here: /index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=6050</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bandits quickly unlocked the cage and retrieved Ty, pinching her nipples to distract her as the other took out a pair of handcuffs. Or rather, footcuffs -- for as he touched first one metal loop than the other to Ty&#39;s thrashing legs, they shrank down to snugly fit her small size, before the connecting chain drew tight, prohibiting movement to her legs.<br />
<br />
After that, the bandits had no difficulty with her, simply taking her arms and hoisting her off the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you taking me?&quot; she demanded, starting to struggle at the expressions on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;See for y&#39;self, luv.&quot; The bandit pointed to the large stone throne. Ty wrinkled her nose at the sight of the obese troll. And he gave her a nasty smile in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;My boys&#39;ve been watchin&#39; you,&quot; he ground out. &quot;Everyone around here knows about that witch -- the Stone Witch we called her. You did well to clear her out. And I -- I cast a scryin&#39; spell while you had yer beauty sleep. I know exactly what you did, and how you bested those mis&#39;rable Goblins as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
He chuckled. &quot;Amateurs. You&#39;ve been brave an&#39; cunnin&#39; -- perfect to <i>round out</i> Madame Lerouge&#39;s order.&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached inside his regal robe, and pulled out a vial, tiny between his massive fingers. &quot;This here&#39;s Vala Vixen&#39;s Perpetual Heat, a nifty little spell, in potion form. If you don&#39;t know what it does, you&#39;ll soon find out. But it only works... on dogs &#39;n foxes &#39;n suchlike. So we need to fix you up a bit first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bandits threw Ty to the ground as the Master lifted his hands and began chanting. She struggled up onto her knees, but couldn&#39;t do much else as a glowing circle of runes appeared around her. The chant pierced through her ears to her core, the troll&#39;s words much clearer and deeper.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Fur of red, eyes of gold,<br />
Sly of heart, huntress bold,<br />
Hunger for the male&#39;s seed:<br />
Lift your tail, fuck and breed.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Ty shuddered as she felt the magic settle on her, penetrated into her body and mind.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Elven arts no more your ken;<br />
Trained in lust to pleasure men.<br />
Hunting for their throbbing cocks,<br />
You dance for them, submissive fox.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s eyes widened, and she stared at the troll in horror. But the magic already suffused her with sensuous warmth, and in moments she felt herself change. To her surprise, it was not painful as it had been with the potions; in fact she began to feel more powerful as she regained and surpassed her original height. Red fur sprouted along her back, white across her front, short and satiny; then lush across a long brush. Her hair went black, and fell down to tickle the base of her tail. Her chest swelled out, well past D, nice and large even her 5&#39;9 body.<br />
<br />
She kept her toned abdomen, but the purpose ceased to be for adventuring -- she was a dancer now. All benefits and perks of the Ranger class vanished from her; she was a non-hero class, a courtesan, skilled in providing companionship and sexual pleasure. Her hips lost their excess muscles, a new layer of fat forming as they widened to match her upper curves and make her attractive as a breeder.<br />
<br />
Memories of how to service men flooded her mind, nearly drowning out her identity entirely; the skills of a professional whore who relished her work. Her Elven traits were also replaced with vulpine, a kitsune&#39;s pride in her beauty and ability to charm men, mixing with her courtesan training to make her pant in longing for strong arms and masterful cocks, for admiring, desiring eyes to be fixed on her. Her magic of illusion and charm adapted to make her more alluring, more pleasing. New instincts too -- magical and intelligence though she was, she was yet an animal at heart. Hunt, play, <i>breed</i>. Like a fox, like a vixen.<br />
<br />
She shook her head, now capped by tall, pointed black ears and ending in a long, narrow muzzle, black markings offsetting her red and white fur. Gold eyes with slit pupils blinked dazedly at the troll. She licked her lips, black and thin along the sides, but plumping out in front, at least the lower one. She swayed, and almost fell forward onto her clawed and padded hands, now sheathed in elegant black gloves.<br />
<br />
But the bandits caught her and hauled her roughly to her feet. She struggled, but it was feeble and unfocused, her brain still reeling under the onslaught of new and carnal knowledge; and the new sensations her ears and nose were conveying to her.<br />
<br />
One bandit pulled her arms behind her arm, while the other stepped forward and took the vial from the Master. &quot;Bottoms up,&quot; he said with a smirk, then shoved his fingers into her nose, pushed the vial to the back of her open muzzle, and poured it down her throat.<br />
<br />
She choked and sputtered, trying to snap at his hand, but he pulled it back unscathed and most of the potion went down.<br />
<br />
The name&#39;s meaning was pretty obvious. Within seconds Ty felt his body heating up. His labia grew thick with arousal, his nipples stiffened -- standing out in bright pink relief against her snowy breast fur -- and her clit throbbed. She whimpered, rubbing her legs together as hot juices dampened her thigh fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel good?&quot; The troll leered. &quot;I bet even the boys can smell that vixen honey, beggin&#39; to be stuffed &#39;n bred. But you won&#39;t get any relief till you get to Lerouge&#39;s. Client&#39;s orders. By then, you&#39;ll <i>literally</i> be beggin&#39; fer cock -- Vala Vixen&#39;s guarantee.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gestured, and the bandits hauled the new kitsune courtesan off to her cage. A <i>new</i> cage, as the one she&#39;d been in previously would now have been too cramped. They took off the leg shackles, thrust her in, and locked the door. She looked over, seeing that the new Steph had passed out after a series of self-served orgasms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, ye&#39;ll be together,&quot; grunted the bandit who hadn&#39;t spoken until now. &quot;Yore a double purchase; Luma Lerouge ordered specifically a tieflin&#39; bard an&#39; a foxy courtesan, to serve &#39;er in &#39;er &#39;arem an&#39; brothel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bordello,&quot; corrected the other brigand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wotever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love hotel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it.&quot; The brigand cuffed the other lightly, and they walked off, chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seraglio.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make me &#39;urt you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty just stared after them, her mind elsewhere. She couldn&#39;t tell if the butterflies in her stomach were from fear, or from desire. She still remembered her mission, and who she had been before the game, but it was distant. Right now, her breasts needed to be fondled and her pussy needed to be filled. She struggled a bit with her urges, before succumbing.<br />
<br />
Leaning back against the bars, she slipped two fingers into her snatch. Then three. Then four. Before she knew it she was fisting vigourously, and whining with frustration. Despite all her stimulation it couldn&#39;t replace the hard, pulsing, knotted meat her training and instincts craved.<br />
<br />
Still, she managed a weak orgasm, then drifted off to sleep, dreaming of being a slutty whore.</p>
