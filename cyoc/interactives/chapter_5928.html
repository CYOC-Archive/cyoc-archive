<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck suddenly bolted on a wild run toward the pasture. Running in circles he kicked up his hind legs and looked to be as a stallion turned out into a springtime pasture.<br />
<br />
Back at the barn Mrs. Ranskin was still shaken by the happenings to the insurance inspector but her prime stallion looked like he was going crazy. All the other ponies stood about their master and watched as Kazan went wild.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kazan, Kazan!&quot; called Mrs. Ranskin.<br />
<br />
Chuck was so thrilled at what he had become that because of his exchanged body he knew not the name Kazan. At last his wild actions calmed and he looked back to the barn filled with ponies and a stunned owner.<br />
<br />
Plodding slowly he walked up the small rise to the barn door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kazan, come here my big stallion!&quot; beconed Mrs. Ranskin with a quartered apple.<br />
<br />
A little clumbsey at grabbing for this with just lips Chuck (Kazan) fumbled the apple piece and it fell to the ground. In less than a second it was scooped up by another pony and gone down the hatch.<br />
<br />
Mrs.Rankin attached a rein to the halter on Kazan's head. A tug on the rein and a happy exinsurance inspector now stallion followed along feeling giddy.<br />
<br />
The lady led him out of the barn and down a path toward what looked like an old smoke house. The door to the building creaked open and both pony and the lady looked inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come Kazan, come boy come!&quot; she said tugging on the rein.<br />
<br />
Kazan looked inside and then up at the lady. After several tugs and many more words the stallion walked into the dark building. As Mrs. Ranskin stepped inside she closed the door and snapped on a light.<br />
<br />
There in the small building was an odd four legged contraption. It was built of wood. It had two flat squares of wood one each side and a curving trough down the middle. The scent of the room was musty and had the lovely smell like the musky scents Chuck remembered after the stallion mounted the mare.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin pulled up a short stool and sat directly face to face with Kazan. Closing her eyes she raised her hands each to a side of the pony's head. Spreading her fingers wide she began a long oratory.<br />
<br />
Chuck stood still as he watched the goings on. A odd feeling like he now felt the urge to say something but he was a pony now and that would be impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kazan, Ely Kazan, Ely Kazan, speak now, tell me what ail's you my friend!&quot; beconed Mrs. Ranskin.<br />
<br />
Chuck looked at her and then to his surprise and Mrs. Ranskin's terror he spoke pure King's Enlish from lips never made for human speach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey lady I don't know what you just did but I'm as happy to be your pony as if I was born here!&quot; spouted Chuck.<br />
<br />
The lady starred at the pony and then rolled backward to the ground. &quot;You are not Ely Kazan?&quot;she blurted out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Mamm, I'm Chuck the insurance, ahh, exinsurance inspector! Who is this Ely Kazan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin sat there looking stunned and then she began to look angry. &quot;You, how did you get to be my pony stallion? An exchange, a exchange of bodies', you found the silver ring!&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, I was at this diner back down the road and I tripped over a root and fell. This bright silver pinky ring was sparkling back at me from the dirt, so I took it and put it on! explained Chuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you pick to exchange with Kazan? Why would you choose to be a pony stallion?&quot; asked the lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it was more a mistake of not knowing that the ring had any magic to it. I was trapped by the pony herd when you ran for the phone, your stallion humped a mare and all I could do is watch. Well whether it was the peace I saw in your valley pasture or the raw sex I'd witnessed, a wish to be like that stallion at stud just came out. said Chuck as if nothing strange was about the happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Mrs. Ranskin who is Ely?&quot; asked Chuck.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin returned to her stool and peered into the round brown eyes of the pony. &quot;My late husband, had a set of three rings made of blessed silver. One when worn could transmigrate the wearer's mind, memories, and total thoughts to any other living thing. The mental abilities of the previous soul in the body would pass into the body that wore the ring. This is the ring which you had on your pinky and was lost from the set five years ago.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That tells me how I'm a pony but who is Ely?&quot; again asked Chuck.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin eyes looked down and she began, &quot;Ely Kazan was my lover! He and I were caught by my husband Lacota as we made love one night a long time ago here in this old smoke house. Lacota heard our moanings and knew that I was having a affair with the stablehand Ely. Lacota donned one of the other rings, a total transformation ring and came back to where we were involved with our sexual play. I remember to this day when Lacota entered the building and stood with the ring on his hand held high and spoke those terrible words. Suddenly my body was raked with pain. My vagina screamed of preasure like nothing I'd felt before. I looked at Ely to see him change from the nice Yiddish man to a dun colored Sumba stallion pony. I remember screaming at his change and continued to scream as I had his huge pony cock burried down my very human vagina.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Sumba what is that?&quot; asked Chuck as he hung on her every word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lacota planned his curse well as he knew the many breeds of ponies. A Sumba is a pony of the Indonesian Islands. In his curse to change Ely to a pony he made it impossible for in any way to be sent to the place of the beast's origin, and by which once he were to live there for one week would change back to his human self. Can you imagine the cost and redtape to send a living animal to Indonesia? Well once Ely finished his load and stepped down from the bedside Lacota led him to the pasture and told him to mate and mount the animals from then on!&quot; she explained further.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK so now I'm the Sumba stallion, does that mean you Ely is inside my body?&quot; asked Chuck.<br />
<br />
The ladies' eyes brightened and she began to smile, &quot;Yes he is in your body and must be reeling with terror by now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Terror, my bod wasn't all that bad looking! Oh true I had a case of Dunlap disease, but other than...&quot; Chuck was stopped by the lady's question.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Disease, what is Dunlap disease?&quot; she asked almost in tears.<br />
<br />
Chuck gave a horsey laugh and replied, &quot;I had a spare tire, I was fat around the belly, Dunlap like a spare tire, around the middle, Oh get real lady!&quot; grumbled Chuck seeing the joke had little meaning to this strange lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;So may I ask a question of you? Good, this Sumba stallion, how old is this body and how long do I have to live?&quot; asked Chuck sounding worried.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin smiled, &quot;Ely was a lovely 19 when he and I were found out! He'd been a stallion now eight years so since Lacota curse him to be a stallion for 100 years that gives you 92 years to be at stud. If you don't mind being this stallion it in my opinion would be a fun life!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck stood quiet for several minutes till he had a good question, &quot;Ok then if I am the prime stallion and the other's out there are mares, were any of them human before?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My Husband was in his mind the great lover of young girls! He would becon girls who were pretty to come here and ride the ponies or just come when I was away. I knew he was unfaithful too but my love for him had long since dwindled. Ely was to me the lust and love I so enjoyed. Yet Lacota would make love till the girl would come to him and tell of her being with child. Then that monster would make his girlfirend a mare for life and her child a foal to build his herd. Over the years the many girlfriends were sold off as breeding mares to other farms all around the state. The mares which are left were the unborn children made foals by lacota's spell over the mother. They were born as foals, raised as ponies, and know nothing of what they could have been. In fact they are ponies in mind and body and can never be made into the people they might have become. So as you mount and mate have no worries about the mare, they are mares and mares are all they can ever be!&quot; Mrs. Ranskin explained the more.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ranskin took hold of Chuck's rein and led him back to his herd. &quot;Now my friend you are free to live your 92 years at stud here or if you ask I'll sell you to a bigger farm. Now go and enjoy, learn to graze and find your new life as a fine stallion and feel the passion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Off the herd went following Chuck into the wide pasture for his first day to feel alive and free.</p>
