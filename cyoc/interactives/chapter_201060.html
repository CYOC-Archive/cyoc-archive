<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wait a bit before following Geoff into the building. It takes you a minute to spot him, because he&#39;s taking the stairs three at a time. You hurry after him selecting his prompt on your phone. &quot;Man who wanted a close relationship with his daughter&#39;s beau.&quot; Okay, so you could change &#39;close&#39; to something safe, but again he won&#39;t get what he wants. It&#39;s the same bind you were in before.<br />
<br />
You pause as Geoff reaches the right floor and studies the floor diagram on the emergency exit. You think to yourself this would have been much easier if it had been Janice&#39;s mother that came to visit. Wait.. if you select &#39;man&#39; and replace it with &#39;woman&#39; ... would that really work? You hesitate, then confirm the change.<br />
<br />
Across the landing a pretty middle-aged woman in a light summer dress is studying the sign. Her auburn hair reaches the middle of her back, and her 2&quot; chunk heeled sandals give her calves and butt just the right amount of perk. You take a deep breath then head over, slipping your phone in your pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her classroom is to the right, I think?&quot; You say as you step up beside her, resting a hand on the woman&#39;s upper back. She&#39;s inches shorter than Geoff so you don&#39;t want to scare her by suddenly looming over her.<br />
&quot;Oh Chet! You startled me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice&#39;s mom fans herself as she clutches your arm, both actions drawing your attention to her rather full bust, something you hadn&#39;t noticed from behind. Your attention is riveted to her generous mounds, showing where Janice clearly gets her rack from, though they aren&#39;t as large as her mother&#39;s. You belatedly realize you didn&#39;t feel a bra strap when you touched her back earlier, so her boobs apparently don&#39;t need much support for how large they are. You blink and think to yourself that you probably shouldn&#39;t be staring at her chest quite so openly, even if it is making her smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, ah, thought we maybe got off on the wrong foot.&quot; You stammer out. &quot;Sorry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You try desperately to remember the woman&#39;s name, but it&#39;s escaping you. She&#39;s a bit shorter than her daughter, even in heels, but she looks young enough that the two of them could be sisters instead of mother and daughter. She gives your bicep a squeeze before letting go.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re here now, so lets go get our girl, shall we?&quot; <br />
<br />
She seems happy now, humming under her breath as you make your way down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you to visit today?&quot; You ask.<br />
&quot;Oh, I wanted to talk to Janice now that the dust has settled.&quot; Seeing your confused look she rolls her eyes. &quot;The divorce I mean. I wanted Janice to know there aren&#39;t any hard feelings on my part.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s kind of you.&quot; You respond. &quot;She&#39;s been kind of tense lately.&quot; <br />
<br />
You decide that&#39;s safely vague, unsure how the changes you made will have affected your girlfriend, but &#39;tense&#39; is nicely nonspecific.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? If I had a stud like you I could think of a few ways to relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stumble as much from her candor as her bumping you lightly with her hip. You can feel your face turn red as she openly looks you up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.&quot; You say, unable to think of what else to say before she turns away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me? Is Intermediate Fiction Studio still in session?&quot; Janice&#39;s mother asks a passing coed.<br />
&quot;I think so? They cover the window while they&#39;re work-shopping to prevent distractions, so they&#39;re probably still at it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh what a pretty necklace! May I take a closer look?&quot; She didn&#39;t wait for a response, stepping forward to lean close to the girl&#39;s chest.<br />
&quot;Ah, sure? Thanks?&quot; The girl&#39;s red v-neck tank top nicely showed off her curves and a gold teardrop pendant nestled in her cleavage. <br />
<br />
You begin to think that Janice&#39;s mom may be a bit of a cougar. A bisexual one at that! The flustered student looks at you with a &#39;what the hell?&#39; expression as the older woman reaches into her top, lightly brushing the girl&#39;s boobs with the back of her fingers as she slides them behind the pendant to lift it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chet, come look at this--do you think Janice would like something like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
You step up to the furiously blushing girl who can&#39;t back away due to the older woman&#39;s grip on her necklace. Janice&#39;s mom is practically breathing down the coed&#39;s top as she examines the pendant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, ah, think she might have something similar already.&quot; You share a helpless look with the girl, shrugging slightly.<br />
&quot;Oh. Well thank you dear.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice&#39;s mom straightens up as she tucks the pendant back into the girl&#39;s cleavage and gives her boobs a light pat before the girl can get away. The coed stammers out something incoherent as she scurries down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too easy, and too innocent.&quot; The older woman said with a sigh. &quot;Nice tits though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, what?&quot; You sputter.<br />
&quot;That other girl, Emma? She knew how to &#39;work it&#39; as you kids say these days.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we do, actually. What was that, were you...hitting on her?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just window shopping, though I wouldn&#39;t mind some bedroom company while I&#39;m in town.&quot; She flips her hair and gives you a bright smile. &quot;Since I&#39;m back on the market and the campus must be full of bicurious young ladies, I&#39;m going to make the most of my time here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; You ask, unsure what else to say.<br />
<br />
You try to think of something to follow that up with that won&#39;t sound like you&#39;re interested in becoming &#39;bedroom company&#39;, but thankfully Janice&#39;s class lets out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chet? And Genna?! What are you doing here?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice embraces Genna, leaning down to give her a peck on the cheek as their chests press tightly together. You swallow and try to compose yourself, but know that the memory of them hugging will likely feature in your next shower masturbation session.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just had to come see you, how are you holding up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, Mom is pretty upset about everything, but that&#39;s on her. I&#39;m doing fine&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice smiles fondly at the shorter woman, and you realize the two of them, other than their curvy figures, don&#39;t look very similar. Wait, &#39;Mom&#39;? What the heck?<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;ve met Chet,&quot; Janice slips her arm around you and leans in for a kiss. A more open display of affection than she normally approves of. &quot;You haven&#39;t been flirting with him have you?&quot; She asks, arching an eyebrow.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been good, honest! Though your friend Emma was looking pretty yummy earlier.&quot; Genna flashed Janice a naughty smile.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you&#39;ll turn her gay and then exhaust the poor girl won&#39;t you?&quot; Janice accused. <br />
&quot;Oh she&#39;s already gay, or bi, or maybe just likes the attention of rich women?&quot; Genna turns to you. &quot;I&#39;m loaded, did you know? Alice gets a stipend thanks to the prenup, but that&#39;s only providing modest living expenses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m confused.&quot; You admit. &quot;Aren&#39;t you Janice&#39;s mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice burst out laughing. Genna pouted and crossed her arms under her boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think I look old enough to have birthed her, do you? I&#39;m only 28.&quot;<br />
&quot;She&#39;s thirty four,&quot; Janice said tartly, &quot;and Genna adopted me when she married mom, so she is my mother, but no biological relation to me.<br />
&quot;So we can finally hook up!&quot; Genna said excitedly. &quot;You, me, this stud, that Emma girl, a case of champagne and a ginormous sudsy tub--&quot;<br />
&quot;Genna, I love you, but curb your libido!&quot; Janice cut in. &quot;I told you no when I turned 21, and I&#39;m saying it again now.&quot;<br />
&quot;How old were you when your moms married?&quot; You ask, a bit skeeved by Genna&#39;s randiness and sexual interest in a girl she helped raise, though you reflect it&#39;s maybe your fault thanks to the app?<br />
&quot;I was 16, though they dated for years until gay marriage became legal.&quot; Janice answered.<br />
&quot;She was just 12 and blossoming when I met her. Honestly, convincing Alice I wasn&#39;t after her daughter was an uphill battle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then you came after me anyway.&quot; Janice rolled her eyes, but didn&#39;t seem upset.<br />
&quot;Honey, I love you, and I even love your mother, but she has not aged as gracefully as you have.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve had this argument before, let&#39;s not have it again?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
&quot;Emma is holding a booth at Chaise Maison d&#39;Or for us, if you&#39;re ready for lunch?&quot; You offer.<br />
&quot;Anything to to get Genna&#39;s mind out of my pants.&quot; Janice replied.<br />
&quot;Party pooper.&quot; Genna stuck a delicate pink tongue out at you.<br />
<br />
Janice kept her arm around you on the stairs, and put herself between you and Genna, though the two women spoke cordially about mutual acquaintances on your way to lunch.</p>
