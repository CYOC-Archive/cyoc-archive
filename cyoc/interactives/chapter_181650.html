<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha was in Times Square that day due to her fascination with space aliens. Unaware as she was, just as the rest of humanity, she would be taking the virus back home with her. She was destined to become a “worker” fatty.<br />
<br />
A week after Earth got its first look at the alien race from Chubbese, Samantha started hearing faint voices in the back of her head. It was like the buzzing a radio made when it was scanning between channels. She couldn’t quite make out what they were saying just yet, but she was aware of how small her clothing were starting to feel. She started joining her mother’s sewing class in an effort to mend her own clothes and maybe save a few pennies on a larger wardrobe. She also started feeling herself getting hungrier and hungrier as her body started packing on size, but that was to be expected from having to lug more weight around.<br />
<br />
The next week, she noticed her nose started to shrink a bit and felt a few bumps in her scalp. She was starting to adjust to becoming a rounder woman and had gotten into making her own outfits from scratch. The voices in her head were starting to get a little clearer as well, almost as though it were a radio transmission. They weren’t clear enough to discern what they were saying, but at least they were less staticky. She also found herself kissing people more often than she used to, and besides that her lips seemed a bit fuller as well. They almost reminded her of the strange space alien’s.<br />
<br />
Come the third week, her family members were starting to feel a little softer around the middle, and her nose had almost completely vanished. The lumps in her scalp were noticeably goldenrod colored and could be seen through her thinning blonde hair. Nobody seemed to be worried more than as if it were a head cold, and Samantha was surprised that she didn’t hate what was happening to her. Maybe there was something to what that fat alien girl was talking about.<br />
<br />
The end of the month was when the voices in her head were finally loud and clear. By then all her hair had fallen out and was replaced with stubby goldenrod colored tentacles, and her skin was starting to transition from a pinkish white to a very pale green. Her body still had quite a bit of growing to do, but she’d certainly packed on at least a good 75 pounds by then.<br />
<br />
“Samantha? Samantha, are we coming in clearly now?” the voices called.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I hear you loud and clear,” Samantha replied aloud, “How do you know my name? Should I be worried? This is probably a huge invasion of privacy!”<br />
<br />
“We don’t mean to intrude, Miss Samantha,” the voices assured, “The reason we know your name is because your brain is now connected to the mothership database. Allow us to introduce ourselves?”<br />
<br />
“You may indeed introduce yourselves,” Samantha replied, “but tell me how and why I’m connected with... what was it again?”<br />
<br />
“The mothership database,” the voice reiterated, “We are from the planet Chubbese, just like ambassador Zeeli. You may call me Malta, and I’m a girl just like you. You may recall that we’re helping your planet become a proper spacefaring race like us? One of the gifts we bestowed upon you was a benign mutagenic virus that would help you put on weight and integrate into fatty society. Perhaps you’ve noticed your nose vanished and your hair fall out?”<br />
<br />
“I wondered what all that was about,” Samantha nodded, “I’m going to turn into a fat space alien like you Chubbesians?”<br />
<br />
“Near about,” Malta explained, “You will still be called an Earthling, but you will no longer be human persey. The way things are progressing, your family will join you in fattydom as well. By our reports, you and what seems to be your sister will become workers who will help get your planet ready for integration by setting up space stations and satellites and anything else you will need. Your father and brother will become drones, and their job is to spread the transformation and eventually breed with a Queen. Speaking of, your mother is going to become a Queen herself, and if you’re following the beehive metaphor you can guess what her role will be. They are still your family and I think you will all still love each other very much, but don’t worry because incest is still going to be illegal.<br />
<br />
“Think I explained all of this well enough, Miss?” Malta asked.<br />
<br />
“I understand you, Malta,” Samantha nodded, “and hey! Maybe being a worker bee could be fun! If I’m lucky, maybe I could meet you in person and we could be friends!”<br />
<br />
“Oh goodness! You want to be my friend?” Malta asked, “I would like that! Maybe I could make a plan to come visit next month and we can meet each other properly!”<br />
<br />
“I can already hardly wait!” Samantha giggled.<br />
<br />
After their conversation, which went over what Samantha was to do next, the soon to be space alien girl laid down on her bed and went to sleep. She received visions of a happy, squishy planet Chubbese in her dreams, and couldn’t wait until Earth would be just like them.</p>
