<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg wasn&#39;t sure exactly when he came to. He couldn&#39;t remember waking up, but here he was... somewhere. It was some kind of hallway. Very plain looking, whitish walls.. if Greg were paying more attention he would still struggle to describe where he was. But he was here, in a dozy kind of state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gregory, come here!&quot; He turned to face the voice, but didn&#39;t see anyone. Greg started walking down the hallway towards the voice, which kept beckoning him. As Greg walked and walked and walked, the voice got no closer despite his walking for what felt like eternity. Or was it a couple minutes? Greg paid no mind to the time.<br />
<br />
What he did notice, however, was how cold he suddenly was. Greg looked down at his body, and after a second of dizziness saw how naked he was. He instinctively put his hands over his dick, but then remembered he was alone in the hallway. As he moved his hands from his sides, his cock began to get warm as it hardened up. The warmth started to spread throughout his body as the cold melted away, comfort taking over.<br />
<br />
As Greg was warming up, he heard his name beckoned again. &quot;Gregory...&quot; he heard, from through the wall. He turned to his left and put his right hand on the wall. As he did, the wall started to dissolve, revealing an irregularly shaped corridor. Greg blinked at this development, and turned back around only to find that the hallway was gone, and he was at the end of a new hallway. As he turned back around, the light dimmed greatly, the new path was poorly lit, just enough light was there to see that along the walls of the new hallway were several clock faces.<br />
<br />
With little choice in the matter, Greg walked forward down the hall. As he did, he felt as if each step he was taking was going slower in time, as if the air was molasses. He felt additional resistance with each stride, but couldn&#39;t stop walking down the forsaken hall.<br />
<br />
After what felt like another eternity, Greg reached the end of the hall, where a large grandfather clock stood with a mirror where the pendulum usually would be. Greg tried to squint in the mirror, but he couldn&#39;t make out his own reflection. Suddenly the clock started ticking, and Greg stood straight up staring into the mirror as it ticked on and on. With every tick, the mirror image became clearer and less cloudy. Greg started to see his reflection as it came into focus; it looked like him, but he was much heftier in this frame. It was like he&#39;d been working out for years. A small gut only accentuated his muscles rather than took away from them. Greg&#39;s physique was also entirely hairless, no body, facial, or head hair to speak of. He did have some wrinkles on his forehead.<br />
<br />
Greg simply accepted that this was his appearance. He was still far too into his dream trance to even clue in that something wasn&#39;t right. The reflection started to ripple again, and Greg walked toward the mirror, and went straight through it as it acted like a liquid as he made contact. The light from the room he entered was blinding at first. As his eyes adjusted, he saw he was in some kind of compact barbershop. There was no door to the room, and the liquid mirror he entered from was simply a wall now. Greg approached the barbers mirror and put his hand to it, leaning over the station. It was very hot, and he jumped back in surprise, falling into a barber&#39;s chair that wasn&#39;t there before.<br />
<br />
Greg just took it for granted when the chair&#39;s loft pumped itself up with no person behind to operate it. He felt the warm, pleasant sensation come over him again as the tools on the desk started taking on a life of their own. Soon, his body was being shampooed by invisible hands all over. As the shampoo frothed over his skin, silver and black hair burst out from his follicles all over his body. His arms and legs grew hairy, all the way to the bottoms of his fingers and toes. His back grew hair, with no exception made for his ass as thick hairs grew in that region too. Out from his chest grew a thick pelt of furry hair, which the invisible hands massaged. The furriness spread right down to his dick, where a thick bush grew out over his balls.<br />
<br />
Greg moaned as the froth dissipated from his now very hairy body. The barbershop wasn&#39;t done with him yet, though. He felt his head turn toward the mirror attentively as his eyes closed off. He felt a warm press against the bottom half of his face, under his nose. It conformed to his chin, and even part of the front of his upper neck. Greg moved his left hand up to his chest and started rubbing his chest fur as he felt the massaging effect on his face as a great beard started to form. The warmth accentuated the blissful feeling of soft hairs growing out from his upper lip, cheeks, and jaw. As they grew out, Greg felt the sensation of his growing beard being stroked and moaned again. He was suddenly jolted back into opening his eyes as he heard that voice again, &quot;Gregory!&quot;. He looked in the mirror and saw his reflection. His silver beard looked magnificent atop his sharp face, and his body looked amazing. The sheer amount of hair was covering his muscular build somewhat, but Greg smiled into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, as if that was the cue, the chair spun around very fast and Greg found himself in a whole new room. He set his arms down to his sides, only to find that he was sitting on some kind of armchair recliner. The footboard kicked up and Greg found himself leaning back into the chair. He got a good look at the room, this looked like the room of someone accomplished. The walls were a deep burgundy, and a tall mahogany bookshelf was propped against one with several large books on it. Across from the shelf was a king sized bed, with silk sheets. It looked very comfortable. Other seemingly luxuries were located in the spacious room, but when Greg got up from his seat he found his paces gravitating towards the large walk in closet. He stepped in, and almost instinctively reached to his left and grabbed a leather harness and slipped it on. He reached onto the shelf and grabbed a cock ring and slipped it over his dick as it grew rock hard. Greg was feeling super lusty, but his look wasn&#39;t complete yet. Greg walked to the back of the enormous closet and opened a shelf, pulling out a large pair of silk black socks. He put them on his feet, and then reached for a pair of high leather boots to his right. He slipped them on, and then heard his name called again, from the bedroom. At the sound of &quot;Gregory&quot;, he licked his lips.<br />
<br />
Gregory walked out of the walk in closet, and saw a man on his bed who looked like he was in his mid 20s. The man was wearing a leather harness as well, and had a finger up to his lips seductively. &quot;Oh, daddy, I thought you&#39;d never come to me!&quot; he said in a whiny voice. Gregory climbed up on the bed and tackled his lover. &quot;Now boy, you have to learn to be patient.&quot; he said in a gruff voice. The boy pouted, &quot;It&#39;s easier wen waiting for you doesn&#39;t feel like a millennium every second, daddy!&quot; Gregory just smiled, &quot;Well I&#39;m here now, boy.&quot; And then he went in for the kiss.<br />
<br />
As his face was pushed against the other man&#39;s, Greg&#39;s mind returned ever so briefly. He was straight! This was some kind of perverted sex dream, he wasn&#39;t any &quot;daddy&quot; or whatever the hell! But Greg&#39;s thoughts were lost in the warm sensation of the two bodies passionately kissing, as Gregory felt the man rub up against his beard during the kiss. Greg&#39;s worries dissolved as Gregory broke the kiss. &quot;Now boy, I&#39;ll know what you&#39;ve been waiting for.&quot; he said, as he motioned for his lover to flip over. His lover presented his ass to Gregory gleefully, and Gregory got up on his knees and started penetrating him. The motion for faster and faster and faster until he started to come and the world went black.<br />
<br />
Gregory woke up with a jolt. He sat up in his king sized bed. He heard a moan from beside him. &quot;Is it time to get up yet?&quot; Asked his younger lover, half asleep. Gregory let out a yawn, &quot;Not yet, babe. Just a weird dream.&quot; Gregory had never really taken the daddy angle with his husband, but with the age gap maybe it would make for a fun experience. At least it would if that sex dream had anything to do with reality.</p>
