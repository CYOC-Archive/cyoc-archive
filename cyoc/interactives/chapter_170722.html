<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had only been minutes since Mark had left the room, but to Aidan it was an eternity already. He was effectively trapped. In front of him was nothing he could use to occupy his mind with. Aidan noticed that his eyes didn´t adjust to the darkness that was in the room, which meant the buttons he had now were useless if it got any darker. He could do nothing but wait in boredom, unable to do anything but mourn his fate or wallow in memories.<br />
Aidan quickly lost his sense of time. Was he here for a day already, or was it only an hour? But if this is Mark´s room, wouldn´t he come by later, at least to sleep? He remembered seeing his reflection before Mark had tossed him on this damn shelf. Still unable to think of himself as just a simple sock monkey, a mere toy for Mark.<br />
The sock monkey he had become had mostly been the color his socks had been before, with a touch from his other clothes. The hands and feet had both been a dark blue. The sock on his cock had been more light blue, which was the coloring of the tail he had now. Does that mean his cock has become his tail? <br />
The legs were nearly the same blue as the feet, just as his jeans had been fitting to his socks. The torso of the sock monkey had been black like Aidan´s shirt. The picture that had been on the front of the shirt had washed out into a dark cream color, which expanded over the chest and belly area. <br />
The head hadn´t resembled him anymore, colored grey like his underwear had been, with a light blue snout from the socks he had worn and were now inside his sewn shut mouth. Big, round, grey ears had been to the sides of the head, and his eyes, former changed sky-blue, were now simple buttons in just that color, unblinkingly watching what was in front of him.<br />
What was worse to Aidan was that he still could taste his formerly worn socks, along with the smell of his underwear covering his nose, even if nothing of them remained behind now. <br />
Finding the memory of how he looked, and what he tasted and smelled right now to depressing, Aidan tried to think about other things. He had nearly finished his project at the Uni today, but that linked him right back to his fate, as he would now never finish his work, at least not if Mark kept him like this.<br />
<br />
When Mark returned, around half an hour after he had left, to Aidan it felt like more as a couple of days. Mark ignored him as he worked on something, most likely homework, before reading something. He went out after some time, only to come back with a bag of chips, just to eat them in front of sock monkey Aidan, further reminding him of his fate. He would never eat or drink anything again.<br />
Later, before Mark went to bed, he took Aidan of the shelf. “Have you settled in already, my little sock monkey? Now, let´s get to work.” With that, Mark started to jerk off, using Aidan´s body as an aid, much to Aidan´s horror. Even if Mark had said so before, Aidan hadn´t believed Mark would be this cruel to him.<br />
After cumming all over Aidan´s body, Mark laughed at him. “Good night, monkey.” Then he tossed him back towards the shelf. Aidan hit the board hard and slipped down two of them, before his tail got caught by an art book. He hadn´t been able to read the title before Mark switched off the lights, and would never be able to read it in the darkness. It had been a present he had made for Mark last year, and this was how Mark treated both the present and Aidan himself.<br />
As Mark snored through the night, Aidan laid there, mostly hanging by his tail, which now painfully made him aware that yes, it had been his cock before, unable to fall asleep. He slowly absorbed Mark´s cum into his cloth body, and the disgust Aidan felt for that decreased when he returned to a clean state on the outside. If that was his life now, Aidan was already in hell.<br />
And indeed, it was. Mark would wake up, ignore Aidan hanging there, still in pain somewhat, go shower, get dressed and leave him alone again. When he returned after his school day, he enjoyed something to eat while reading something on Aidan´s laptop, which was now Mark´s. Then he would do his homework or read some more, still ignoring Aidan. Later, before going to bed, Mark used him again as a masturbation aid, laughing in the “cute monkey face” before tossing him aside again.<br />
Aidan would have gone crazy from this, but to an unknown reason he didn´t. Mark had made sure Aidan would remain sane in there. Aidan again rested on a shelf, this time fully, absorbing Mark´s cum yet again. <br />
And this continued for weeks. Some days Mark ignored his monkey completely, not even using him. On others, he would take him down from the shelf and sat him beside his homework or the laptop. That was when Aidan realized he couldn´t read anymore, as both Mark´s homework and the screen showed unreadable scrawl to him.<br />
Over the time Mark never called him Aidan, but monkey, or some times by a description pet-name like “cutey”. So, when after some weeks Mark showed monkey a mirror, he saw his coloration was washing out. But as Mark had never washed him, that had to be done by his cum. The dark blue color was by now light blue, the former light-blue tail and snout nearly white. The grey head was also nearly white, the dark cream color was now light, and the black had become greyer like his head had been.<br />
But the worst part for monkey had become that the longer he was like this, the more he forgot about what his life had been before. He couldn´t recall his name, other than Mark calling him monkey most of the time. Mark´s own name also wasn´t there anymore, monkey saw him more as his owner now. Memories had washed away like his color, leaving him more and more just the inanimate tool his owner had made him be.<br />
Monkey´s hope had by now also washed away, as it had just reminded him of how bad his fate was. Some time longer, and monkey would just be a simple minded, inanimate sock monkey, and his old life would be dead to him.</p>
