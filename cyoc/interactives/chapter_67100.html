<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You contemplated leaving the cave, but decided not to. You were both tired, and what would you do anyway? Say <br />
&quot;Hey, I'm pregnant now.&quot; to the other girls? You then thought, &quot;I'm going to be stuck as a mermaid for the <br />
rest of my life with these girls now, and that means I'm stuck like this for hundreds of years to come. I <br />
might as well try to start making some sort of friendship with them. Elizabeth seems like the easiest, now <br />
that we're so close, so I might as well make her a close friend.&quot; you finished thinking and looked at her. She <br />
was feeling her own stomach happily, like most if not all mothers do when they're pregnant. You were both <br />
Mothers, and now you were practically her wife and she was yours. You had two wives, and only one of them <br />
would ever be able to know about the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how did you become part of the sisterhood?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was only 7 years old when it happened, about 500 years ago, the year 1512. My Family and I lived in a <br />
reasonable place at the time. We all loved each other, and I thought this would last forever, until one <br />
night.&quot; she stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad... he came home with a mob behind him. Only thing was... he wasn't alive. He fell down, with a knife <br />
being stuck in his back. As soon as he fell, the mob came, and my mother who was standing there in shock, <br />
grabbed me by the arm, and we ran away as fast as we could. We found an old abandoned house near a bay. She <br />
forced me inside and locked the front door. She told me &quot;Hide! Don't let them find you!&quot; I had no idea what <br />
was going on, but I listened and tried to find some sort of back door to run away in case they got in. The <br />
sooner I could run away, the better it would be to lose them. &quot;GET OUT OF THE WAY, WITCH!&quot; I heard a man yell. <br />
&quot;Witch?&quot; I thought. &quot;My mother isn't a witch!&quot; I tried to yell, but I couldn't let myself do that.<br />
<br />
I couldn't let myself be caught. I knew my mother wasn't a witch, and she was going to be killed for being <br />
accused of being one. They would never let the daughter of a witch survive, so I knew that I had to make the <br />
most out of my Mother's sacrifice as fast as I could. Finally, I found the back door, and tried to think of a <br />
plan to escape as soon as I would open it. I finally decided I would hide in the bay, where they'd never <br />
expect me to hide in. They'd think the little girl would run off into the woods, not wanting to get herself <br />
wet in the lake. I took off all of my clothes, and hid them in a drawer in the house. I couldn't swim in those <br />
clothes even if I tried, and if I took them off in the shore of the bay, then they'd know I went there to <br />
hide. I heard my mother scream, and they started pounding on the door.<br />
<br />
I immediately ran out the exit as fast as I could. I ran crying, cold, and alone. The wind was so strong, and <br />
the grass was so moist. I finally reached the shore of the lake when I heard a yell from inside the house. <br />
&quot;WHERE IS THE GIRL!? KILL HER! DAUGHTER OF A WITCH!&quot; a man yelled. I threw my self towards the ground, to <br />
avoid being spotted, and tried to crawl backwards into the lake to prevent being spotted. The water was so... <br />
incredibly cold. My feet went in and I had to resist the urge to pull my feet out. If I splashed, it was all <br />
over. When the water reached my stomach, I just couldn't even try to pull myself in. I was stuck. But finally, <br />
I pulled myself in the water.<br />
<br />
I could barely move, the water may as well have been frozen. But I swam under the water as fast as I could, <br />
only rising up for air when I absolutely needed to. I found a small cave, where I hid. That's where I found <br />
the other sisters. I could barely make out their faces at the time, because of how dark it was. &quot;Hmmm... who <br />
might you be, little girl?&quot; one of them said. &quot;My name's Elizabeth, don't tell anyone I'm here, please. They <br />
killed my mommy and daddy. I don't want to die.&quot; I said, scared. &quot;Don't worry, we won't tell, we don't like <br />
people all that much.&quot; she said. &quot;Huh?&quot; I responded confused. The other girls laughed, and one of them rose <br />
completely out of the water and sat on a rock. &quot;Feel my legs, my child.&quot; I swam over to her, and felt her <br />
legs. I gasped when I realized &quot;You.. you're a mermaid!&quot; I responded. I was shocked, I was so interested in <br />
the mermaid stories at the time, my dad being a fisherman, he would tell me my mother was beautiful mermaid he <br />
met on a fishing trip, and that's why we were so beautiful. I knew they were only stories, not real, just a <br />
little bit of fiction to get me to sleep, but I loved them anyway. &quot;Want to live with us, little girl? We'll <br />
raise you like our own daughter, and you could be part of the sisterhood with us for thousands of years until <br />
we die. We'll be like the best of friends, family, and love each other forever&quot; she said. &quot;But... I'm not a <br />
mermaid, how could I live with you?&quot; the others giggled when I said this. &quot;Oh, you poor little girl, don't the <br />
humans know anything about us? We can make you a mermaid, deary. You're lucky to have found us at your young <br />
age, otherwise you couldn't, but we can make you. Sit on my lap.&quot;<br />
<br />
I got up on the rock and sat on her lap, as she instructed. She grabbed my head gently, and pulled my head to <br />
her breasts, my mouth on her nipple. &quot;Now my child, drink my milk, for I am your new mother, and you my new <br />
child. Together, we will live together in happiness, all of us, as sisters. As the beauties of the sea. As <br />
mermaids.&quot; I had lost my whole family in one night, and in that very night, I was being the chance to be part <br />
of a new family. Reborn, a new person, being promised happiness. With that thought, I began sucking. As I did, <br />
she began moaning fairly quietly in pleasure, almost like a strange song. The milk poured into my mouth, and <br />
it was delicious. The greatest liquid I'd ever drunk in my entire life. As I drank, my legs fused together, my <br />
vagina being moved to where it is now. My feet became flattened and turned into fins, I grew the dorsal fin on <br />
my back, and scales sprouted on my tail. But that wasn't all, in my chest, I could feel it, I was growing a <br />
pair of breasts.  Obviously, they weren't fully developed, not even an A cup, but I could feel them. I was a 7 <br />
year old with breasts. Even my nipples started feeling sensitive in the wind. I was a child mermaid, destined <br />
to be a beautiful adult surrounded by my sisters, my new family, and I was happy. Fast forward to today, and <br />
here we are.&quot; she finished her story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was so sad. Don't you miss your parents?&quot; you ask. &quot;Yes, when I found her body, I convinced my <br />
sisters to bury her near the house, and we visit every 50 years.&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got onto land?&quot; you asked. &quot;Of course! When our tails get dry, we become human. However, in your case, <br />
for you to become a human male, we need to test how willing you were to get together with your wife, so  <br />
Florencia set up this test. We would've killed you, actually, when we first spotted you, but... I fell in love <br />
with you at first sight, so I asked if they could turn you into a sister and live with us.&quot; She hugged you, <br />
her breasts pressed against you. &quot;We'll be mothers, sisters, and wives. I love you, Michelle, be with mine <br />
forever, please. You're the only mermaid I can relate to, and I promise I'll love and respect your wife as <br />
long as she lives. I know! We could be friends, after we let you go back to your wife, I could be friends with <br />
her, and we could talk, and it'd be so much fun, and we could still keep the secret about mermaids. Oh, life <br />
with you is going to be so much fun I know it!&quot; She kissed you on your cheek, and hugged you a bit harder <br />
until she finally fell asleep. It was late, and you should fall asleep too. You had to admit though, for some <br />
reason, you began to love Elizabeth the same way you loved your wife.</p>
