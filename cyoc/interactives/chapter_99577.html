<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner and the early evening had gone fairly well at the Stovall house, though both Martin and Melissa found the main subject of discussion being one Eric Anderson. Julie had told them about her day and barely restrained herself from jumping up and down in happiness over the results of the day. It also lead to both adult weremers managing to stifle chuckles at Julie&#39;s excitement, though they also did feel glad for their daughter&#39;s cheer.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it would sound like you had a very good day today,&quot; Martin commented as Melissa handed him the dinner plates to take from the kitchen to the dinning room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it did,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;I was nervous over what he said at lunch... but I didn&#39;t know he was coming to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin smiled over his shoulder as Julie followed him, &quot;I think he&#39;s really taken with you... and simply wished to know more about weremers and I&#39;d suppose what being a merman is like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And whatever you said must have convinced him... because he said on the way home that he&#39;d swim with me forever,&quot; Julie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I pretty much gathered THAT when I drove home,&quot; Martin continued to smile, &quot;It is nice to see such young love bloom so beautifully.&quot;<br />
<br />
And he was honest with that. He had his concerns, as Julie was only fourteen, and Martin didn&#39;t feel ready to be a grandfather yet. He also privately figured that the Andersons, as they were adapting to being weres themselves, weren&#39;t ready to be grandparents either. Though, Melissa had told him that she had Julie on the were-mer birth control pill, which was some relief. Not that that really removed the concerns of a loving parent.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Julie smiled, feeling her heart flutter. &quot;Though... I did get a bit nervous that I was rushing him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things between the two of you are progressing quickly,&quot; came her mother&#39;s voice as she joined her husband and daughter, carrying the last of the night&#39;s dinner, &quot;but... have you actually demanded he become a weremer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie detected a bit of a questioning tone in her mother&#39;s question, but figured it was related to the issues they&#39;d had with regard to dealing with Yvette&#39;s actions. Her parents wouldn&#39;t want their own daughter forcing herself on the son of Yvette&#39;s first victim.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Julie answered honestly, &quot;I&#39;ve made no demand... I&#39;ve wanted him to be a weremer... but I&#39;ve made no demand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So things are just progressing fast naturally,&quot; Melissa said slowly. &quot;Does it feel right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;and Eric said he didn&#39;t think the progress was bad...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so he loves you?&quot; Martin asked, placing a hand on Julie&#39;s shoulder, and looking to get the answer he suspected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie said with her eyes twinkling, &quot;He loves me... and I love him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie then moved to sit beside her father as dinner began. She enjoyed the meal as her parents also began to eat as well. While there had been times when she&#39;d been nervous over things, the day had gone extremely well and she was eagerly awaiting the future. She knew that Eric loved her and would be her merman, though they had agreed to wait for the right moment... the infamous &quot;someday.&quot; As she chewed on some shake and back chicken, she eagerly daydreamed on that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is a good thing,&quot; Melissa spoke as she sat down, &quot;love is always important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even when it raises worries...&quot; Martin gave a soft chuckle.<br />
<br />
With that, Julie looked up to her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I done something wrong?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dear,&quot; Martin smiled and reached out with one hand to touch Julie&#39;s, &quot;It&#39;s just that you&#39;re my daughter and a lot of this is going fast. I mean... you&#39;re the youngest mer in our family&#39;s pod to find his/her true love. I was an adult when I first saw your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie followed his father&#39;s eyes as they shifted from her to her mother and then back to her. His grey/green eyes flashed blue for a moment and then returned to their normal grey/green color.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to me... you&#39;ll always be the little blond baby in an over-sized yellow shirt and diaper,&quot; Martin said to her, &quot;walking toward me for the first time with a bright smile and giggle...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daaaaaad,&quot; Julie sighed.<br />
<br />
Martin shuffled his chair over to give his daughter a warm hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it, Julie,&quot; Martin told her, &quot;You&#39;ll always be my baby girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie chuckled and hugged her father back, &quot;but I am growing up... and I love him so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their hug was strong and firm, but still brief. As Martin released her, he calmly moved his chair back to his spot and he gave her a fatherly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of that, your mother and I are both well aware,&quot; Martin smiled and dug his fork into the mashed potatoes on his plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just want you to be careful,&quot; Melissa added, &quot;we can see that you love him... and from Martin told me of his meeting... and from what you&#39;ve said tonight... that Eric loves you too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He does,&quot; Julie spoke, the twinkle in her eyes undiminished.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s where we want you to be careful,&quot; Melissa said slowly, &quot;Your father and I would prefer that you and Eric wait on taking your relationship to the next level until after you&#39;ve both graduated high school...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that may not happen,&quot; Martin than said slowly, &quot;Especially if Eric is willing or potentially eager... In that way... true love probably wouldn&#39;t wait for promises...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he is a good kid and if he does love you back... it won&#39;t be THAT much of a concern,&quot; Melissa finished, &quot;Much of what we wanted from your promise to wait was that you didn&#39;t let your libido go out of control or get you into trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll NEVER be a rogue were,&quot; Julie said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know,&quot; Melissa said with a soft smile, &quot;but we are still your parents and entitled of worry and make sure that you don&#39;t rush into a mistake or anything like that. We&#39;ll always love you and wish you to be happy... but we&#39;ll also want you to grow into a wise and respectful woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I will,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to just go and urge Eric to have sex with me because I love him and he loves me... I want the moment to be special and one that reflects true love... not just because one or both of us are aroused...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that makes things better,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;and something your mother and I would prefer when it it comes to... you know know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa also nodded. She knew that it was very possible that the love that seemed to be growing between her daughter and the youngest Anderson boy was strong enough that the two of them could become sexually active before they graduated high school, which really wouldn&#39;t be too out of the ordinary for Moon Lake. But, with Julie&#39;s comment of wanting the moment to be special could also very well mean that she and Eric might not actually get that far prior to high school graduation. She&#39;d even remembered Martin telling her that their first moment together was to be magical and romantic and not simply for sex alone. At the time, she had been a little surprised as at that moment, Martin was in the lake and sporting a dark blue scaled merman tail while she sat on the dock, but he was proved right in the end. Their wedding night had been magical and had been more than just sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s good,&quot; Melissa said to her, &quot;because you do understand what will happen to him if the two of you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, mom,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;and when the moment comes... I will make sure that Eric is well aware of what will happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa and Martin nodded and smiled. That was acceptable to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the meantime... just let things continue to go normally,&quot; Martin said to her, &quot;both of you have a bright future... and from what I gathered... it&#39;s likely that Eric was leaning toward being a weremer even before we talked. So... just be patient and calm with each other... and in the end... you&#39;ll both be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you won&#39;t be too upset if Eric and I...?&quot; Julie began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d prefer that you wait,&quot; Melissa said to her daughter, &quot;but if you both love each other and the moment comes naturally... we can accept that. And so long as you keep taking your birth control pill... we will let you be with Eric in every possible way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded, &quot;We aren&#39;t ready to be grandparents, yet, and at fourteen... you and Eric are both too young to be parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I will keep taking my pill,&quot; Julie promised, and her eyes twinkled at the prospect of a very bright future with her boyfriend, &quot;though... there&#39;s only one more thing to be prepared for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Martin wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know how to dance?&quot; Julie asked her parents weakly.</p>
