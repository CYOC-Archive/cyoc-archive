<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We were lying in bed later in the afternoon. I think I was in a post orgasmic state of euphoria. I raised the musings of the afternoon.<br />
&quot;Hilda gave a big hint about grandchildren. She said she thought I would be a great mother. It got me thinking&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thinking about what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About babies, pregnancy, motherhood......Do you want to have kids, be a Mum?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In time. There is no hurry. But yes at some stage I want a family. Maybe 3 kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering what it would be like to be pregnant. It certainly isn&#39;t something I ever thought about when I was Zach&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that&#39;s something I have been preparing for, all my life. You sort of always expect that it would happen someday. First thing on the agenda was always to find Price Charming. However currently I have Cinderella instead&quot; He gave me a kiss.<br />
<br />
We got up and made a toasted sandwich each for dinner. Later we watched the 2005 version of &#39;Pride and Prejudice&#39;.  Sarah wanted to see how I reacted watching the movie as a woman. You certainly had a different perspective.<br />
<br />
After the movie, Biddy got put out and we went to bed. I fell asleep cuddling my very own &#39;Mr Darcy&#39;<br />
......<br />
We woke at 6 the next morning and Sarah suggested we go for a run. I had enjoyed running with her last week so agreed. Only this time Sarah would be wearing shorts and a tee shirt and I would be in her gym wear.<br />
<br />
While I went to the toilet and checked my pad (I was still spotting) Sarah got out some leggings, a crop top and some joggers for me to wear.<br />
<br />
We ran back down to the creek and along the path to the playground and sat on &#39;Our Spot&#39; on the grassy bank. I was tired but no more so than last week when I was Rod. &quot;I&#39;ve really enjoyed these last few days being you&quot; I told Sarah as he sat beside me. &quot;It&#39;s actually starting to become comfortable. I becoming an expert on periods&quot; I giggled<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t get too comfortable. I want that body back and I want you back in this body&quot; <br />
<br />
Yes, I&#39;m looking forward to some bedroom fun tonight as well&quot;<br />
<br />
We sat there for another minute then got up and stretched, preparing for the jog home. &quot;Is there anything happening at work today I should know about?&quot; I asked<br />
&quot;Just the usual. It should be Karen and Marlene there. Let&#39;s get going I&#39;m starting to feel hungry&quot;<br />
We ran together back home, I was getting used to the mechanics of this body. Bouncing boobs and a big bum had felt so alien when I had first transformed. Now it felt natural. <br />
<br />
We let Biddy into the house and promised him a walk after work. We ate breakfast and then showered together. I was able to wrap my legs around Sarah&#39;s waist and feel him inside me. Another new experience. I didn&#39;t climax but that didn&#39;t concern me this time around.<br />
After the shower I dressed in Sarah&#39;s work clothes, a black skirt and lilac shirt with &#39;Penberthy Motors&#39; embroidered on the pocket. I did my hair and make-up then packed a lunch. I gave Sarah a goodbye kiss before driving her car to the dealership.<br />
<br />
As I walked in the front entrance I greeted Mitch and Gerard with a smile and a &quot;Good morning&quot;. Marlene with a coffee in hand delegated me to man the front desk this morning. She was going to need Karen to help her in the back office. For whatever reason I felt very contented today and think I was very cheery both on the phone and with walk in customers. I think it was just another example of me feeling comfortable being Sarah.<br />
<br />
Karen arrived shortly after me. But I didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to her until lunchtime. When I finally did, I found out that Daniel had asked her on a date. They were going to the movies tonight. She asked my opinion on what she should wear. My reply was that it depended on how far she was intending to go on a first date. I reminded her that Daniel was a workmate so perhaps slow and steady was the best approach.<br />
<br />
In the afternoon we shared the desk duty and at one stage a couple walked in when all the sales team were busy. I ended up showing them over the Mazda 3. Gerard eventually came across as they were asking if they could go on a test drive. I was surprised when he threw me the keys to the demonstrator vehicle and said to the couple that Sarah would accompany them. <br />
<br />
I knew the procedure from watching what the sales team did and bought the demonstration car to the front of the dealership, before giving the keys to the girl who I had learnt was the actual buyer. The man was her brother. I helped her to adjust her seat and mirrors and sat beside her in the front while we drove around some nearby streets. The brother also had a drive. They seemed very impressed.<br />
Eventually we returned to the dealership and with Gerard&#39;s help and approval I offered them our best price. They went away happy saying they would consider things overnight.<br />
<br />
Gerard said he had a good feeling about a potential sale and congratulated me on the way I had interacted with the couple. I was feeling pretty pleased with myself.<br />
<br />
I went back to the desk and in no time at all Marlene was saying it was after 5 and time to head home. I grabbed my bag and literally skipped out to Sarah&#39;s car, then drove home.<br />
<br />
Sarah had beaten me home and had just put Biddy&#39;s lead on to take him for a walk. I quickly changed my shoes and joined them, still in the skirt and work shirt, for the walk. We walked arm in arm around the block as I recited the events of the day.<br />
<br />
Once home we decided that there was no time like the present. Sarah suggested we do a proper body-swap by both touching the medallion at the same time. I thought why not? so agreed.<br />
<br />
We both stripped off so we were naked and I hung the medallion around my neck. I looked at Sarah and asked if he was ready. He said &quot;Yes&quot;. We gave each other a hug. I felt the &#39;Zap&#39;. I was confident that I would soon be Rod again<br />
<br />
Here I was hugging a naked male in a naked female body. Soon we were kissing and retired to the bedroom. I suggested we should hurry before the changes went to far. Soon Sarah was on top of me. I could feel her penis shrinking and her chest growing as we made love. Eventually my vagina sort of squeezed his nub out. Soon it was me inside and on top of her.</p>
