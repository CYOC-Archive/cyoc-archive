<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin was staring at his phone; sitting in a small room by himself with in the elder council building. With his robe cinched up tight as he is in his stage two wer-mer form; he reluctantly texts a message.<br />
‘Melissa what has become of our daughter? Julie has escaped from the council building, and she just committed murder.’<br />
Hitting send; Martin’s recipient being his wife, he drops his phone and becomes emotional. Unable to hold back he places his webbed hands to his face and cries.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Tachibana escorts the five werewolves of the Luna Brotherhood to where Martin was last spotted. Wanting to talk to him herself but was unable to what with ensuring Eric, Frieda and Spencer where all right and having to deal with Brett Smithson arguing the legality of trial by absentia; Tachibana knew that the chat she wanted to have would have to be superseded with the Luna Brotherhood Alpha wanting to ask the elder Stovall some questions.<br />
<br />
They approach the small chamber to hear him crying; knowing that this is a trying time; Tachibana places a paw on the Alpha, “go easy on him. Martin just had a mental gut check in regards to his daughter.”<br />
The Alpha nods and motions for his entourage to wait outside while he and Tachibana enter.<br />
“Martin,” Tachibana sighing; “I know you must be distraught, but time is of the essence.” Sitting down next to him, “I need you to answer a few questions; you think you can do that?”<br />
“I- I’ll try,” Martin answers.<br />
“This is the Alpha from the Luna Brotherhood,” Tachibana motioning to the werewolf; “please co-operate and answer his questions.”<br />
“Okay Martin,” the Alpha speaking up; “I’ll get straight to the point. Is there any place in Moon Lkae Julie might try to hide out in?”<br />
“The lake,” Martin shrugs his shoulders.<br />
“Any friends she can go to?”<br />
“They all abandoned her when she assaulted Eric and Frieda,” Martin laments.<br />
Anyone else you can think of? Family?”<br />
“My brother and his wife,” Martin sighs; “but they live in Hawaii. There is also my mother in California.”<br />
“We’ll have agents keep a discreet eye on both locations,” The Alpha calmly responding; “I and my colleagues would like to search your house for possible clues, would that be allright?”<br />
“I suppose,” Martin felling emotionally raw; “but my wife has the car we all came here in.”<br />
“We’ll give you a ride home,” The Alpha consoling the distraught wer-mer; “Tachibana can we talk privately?”<br />
“Of course,” Tachibana getting up; “please follow me.”<br />
<br />
Heading to her private office, the Alpha begins speaking.<br />
“Who are Eric and Frieda?”<br />
“A Victim and a witness in Julie Stovall’s current statue 1A problems,” Tachibana answers; “and no, you will not talk to them. They have had enough drama involving Julie. You are not going to rouse them from their nap with Spencer Lawson to ask them questions.”<br />
“Lawson,” the Alpha perks up; “brother to Evan Lawson?”<br />
“Evan’s daughter,” Tachibana answering; “and off limits.”<br />
“Fair enough,” the Alpha responds; “I only ask because we’ve had our eye on Evan as a possible addition to the Luna Brotherhood.”<br />
“Not going to happen,” Tachibana answers; “Evan has already signed paperwork to work at Tachibana securities once his stint in the military is already concluded. And I thought we agreed you’d stop trying to recruit werewolves here in Moon Lake!”<br />
“It’s not a crime seek out those that can help protect our existence from the rest of the world,” the Alpha answers; “we don’t have a kiosk handing out pamphlets to passerby’s in a mall like some recruiting sergeant for what branch of the military.”<br />
“Now if this is what you wanted to talk to me privately about,” Tachibana’s patience wearing thin; “than we are done.”<br />
“It’s not,” the Alpha responding; “it’s this.” The Alpha handing over a scroll to Tachibana.<br />
<br />
Tachibana reading the scroll just shakes her head while putting it down; “This is a matter between you and Randolph.”<br />
“Randolph doesn’t like my brother,” the Alpha answers.<br />
“Randolph doesn’t like anyone,” Tachibana answers; “he tolerates most of us but would rather be left alone to run in the woods each night eating rabbit.”<br />
“My brother needs job experience,” The Alpha answering; “having him volunteer here would be a big help to him and future relations with this town and the Luna Brotherhood.”<br />
“You make it sound political,” Tachibana shaking her head.<br />
“It’s a favor,” The Alpha answering; “one you can hardly refuse.”<br />
“I’ll get Randolph to speed it through,” Tachibana sighing; “but right now, you have a rogue were to hunt down.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
It was a solemn ride home for Martin Stovall; not wanting to be at the council building anymore, he did not hesitate to accept the ride with the five werewolves in grey suits back to his house. Seeing his car still not in the driveway, martin knew Melissa had to be at Frances’s office still. Not knowing that his text caused Melissa to faint and be rushed to the hospital; Martin opened his front door and allowed the five werewolves in side.<br />
“Julie’s room is upstairs, first door on the left;” Martin answering while grabbing a beer from the fridge. While it wasn’t even noon; martin needed something to help steady his nerves as the five werewolves head upstairs to Julie’s room.<br />
<br />
Moments later the Alpha heads back down with a small nondescript box and a letter with it.<br />
“We found this,” The alpha placing the items on the kitchen island; “I’m sorry but I already read it. It’s not pleasant.<br />
Martin takes the letter and starts reading its contents.<br />
<br />
‘Mom, Dad;<br />
By the time you find this letter, I’ll be gone. I already know what the outcome of my statue 1A trial will be. I know Brett will try and argue for attempted Statue 1A. None of her strategies will work. I will be declared unanimously guilty by every single council rep and sent to a cell, who the hell knows where and left to rot. I have no intention of letting that happen. You keep saying actions have consequences; I say to hell with the consequences. I make my own decisions, my own choices and I regret none of them; least of which what I write in this letter.<br />
<br />
If I had a another chance; I would not hesitate to turn Eric Anderson into a wer-mer. But that ship has sailed. He is now a were-panther and clearly beyond my reach to strike at. Him and his tramp girlfriends Spencer and Frieda; tell them to watch their backs, one day I will have my due with them. Brian Walker will also feel my wrath. I still have not forgotten the humiliating way he broke up with me. No one breaks up with me. I break up with them!<br />
<br />
And lastly you two. First you dad; as mayor, you could of used your influence to make all this go away. You could of crushed the Anderson’s, threaten the school’s funding or fire the sheriff for arresting me. But no, all you did was sit on your ass and bitch at me for wanting revenge. Revenge I have a right too!<br />
And mom, that fetus growing in you; my future brother or sister. I hope you have a miscarriage; I hope it dies inside of you; because you are now dead to me. Both of you.<br />
<br />
P.S the box this letter was sitting under; its phallic content was paid with your credit card dad, from the same sites I used to look at porn. It cost a shitload of money and gave me lots of pleasure. Let it be a reminder as to how I view you as. A giant tool.<br />
<br />
With malice and hatred to you both<br />
Julie’<br />
<br />
“How could you say such hateful things Julie,” Martin bursting into tears yet again; “How could you.”<br />
“I’m sorry you had to read that,” The Alpha opening up the box Julie mentioned in her letter. In the box was a large fluorescent green phallic object. With a flared head reminiscent to a horses cock as well as the top knot of a wolf. The shaft also sported many bumps; shaped like the barbs on a feline’s member but only dull, it’s clear the vibrator was meant to provide the most pleasure a female were could ever want without having the genuine article in her.<br />
“Get rid of it,” Martin staring at the offensive object; “I don’t want to look at it. Nor do I want my wife to see it.”<br />
“Your daughter’s bed,” the Alpha speaking; “it reeks of urine and sweat, does your daughter suffer from incontinence?”<br />
“No,” Martin chugging his beer; “she had some bad dreams and I guess wet her bed as a result. You’ll find the soiled bed sheets in the laundry room downstairs.” Getting up to grab another beer and cracking it open and downing it real quick Martin speaks yet again, “if you need them to help track down Julie with her scent; then take them.  Find my daughter and… and just lock her away.”<br />
“The letter said your wife is-“<br />
“Melissa is pregnant,” Martin finishing; “about two weeks now. Melissa’s O.B.G.Y.N confirmed it a few days ago.”<br />
“Congratulations then,” Alpha answering as he gets up. Staring at the mayor of Moon Lake, the Alpha wonders if he should be left alone right now. Despite his cold demeanor, the Alpha of the Luna Brotherhood was a caring werewolf. A father of three pups with his wife and a philanthropist in both Seattle and Tacoma; he asks martin a question, “is there anyone you know that can come over and be with you right now?”<br />
“Andrew,” Martin answers; “but he is busy sitting in on my daughters Statue 1A trial. Right now I want to be left alone.”<br />
“I don’t think that is wise,” the Alpha staring at Martin as he grabs another beer from his fridge; “You’re clearly upset and well on your way to being soused.”<br />
“I’m upset because my daughter just ensured she will locked away until the day she dies if you ever capture her,” Martin shouting; “I’m getting drunk to try and numb myself with all this. So excuse me; but when I say I want to be alone, I MEAN IT! Now get out of my house!”<br />
<br />
The Alpha and the rest of the werewolves gather what they could; Taking the bed sheets and some of Julie’s clothing as a means to memorize her scent; they leave a distraught Martin Stovall alone as he starts heading for the hard liquor he keeps for special occasions.<br />
<br />
Outside, the Alpha places a phone call to Moon Lake police to inform them of Martin Stovall’s inebriation and concerned he might do something foolish in the day. Hanging up he looks at his brethren.<br />
“Gather the pack,” The Alpha speaking; “we have a wer-mer to hunt.”<br />
“Where do we begin,” one the other werewolves ask<br />
“We begin by listening to the police bands,” the Alpha getting back into the car; “contact our were-allies* in and around Seattle. Have them keep an eye out for Julie; offer a reward for any information.”<br />
<br />
<br />
* Were-allies: Any and all were’s that assist the Luna Brotherhood that are not werewolves.</p>
