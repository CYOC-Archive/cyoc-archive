<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The M/F sex warning is more for what Karen hears in the chapter. Nothing is actually shone...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Karen,&quot; came Rich&#39;s voice from beside her making Karen shake her head and blink suddenly as the fantasies of jumping through the trees to go after Oliver went through her head.<br />
<br />
She looked over to her right to see that Rich had returned to her side with some look of concern while Olivia was slightly ahead of her and to her right with a small smirk on Olivia&#39;s muzzle. This essentially betrayed to Karen that they likely knew what was going on. Likely by scent when Karen caught a scent of arousal coming from herself, and she ended up blushing fairly heavily with embarrassment, even if Rich or Olivia couldn&#39;t see that through her fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you ARE open to going after that werecougar,&quot; Oliva teased with a small smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I...&quot; Karen managed, &quot;I don&#39;t WANT to do that... but... the mention of it... it just seemed to create some fantasies... with me bounding through the trees to find him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An interesting fantasy, especially as like mundane tigers, we&#39;re too big and heavy to be arboreal,&quot; Olivia kept her smirk, &quot;we can get into the lower branches of some of the bigger deciduous trees in town, but we still have a bit much in the way of muscle mass to jump from tree to tree. Shoot, event he smaller feline weres, werecats, wereleopards, werecougars, and werewildcats would potentially be too heavy for some tree branches to support their weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said the... emm… &quot;daydream&quot; was factual,&quot; Karen tried to defend her position, &quot;I shook my head no to the suggestion while a part of me actively began to wonder at hunting him down for... well... the very thing I said no to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen was heavily embarrassed by all of this, particularly as so much of it related to the issues that related to running from the Gambonis. Marcus had made a fair number of sexual advances on her when the whole chase started, which wasn&#39;t too bad since both of them were the same age, but he never took &quot;no&quot; for an answer, and there were parts of Karen&#39;s mind that actually feared that Marcus would have raped her if he ever could have cornered her alone. It was one of the things that had also drawn Karen&#39;s attention to some of the larger feline weres, to gain the strength and power to defend herself from such unwanted advances. She didn&#39;t like that sort of uncontrolled &quot;attention&quot; that Marcus tried to force on her and didn&#39;t want to be in a position where she wasn&#39;t at someone&#39;s mercy and neither did she really want to be in a position where she dominating someone else, that only reminded her of Marcus and she shuddered at the prospect of being like him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Rich assured her, &quot;a lot of that is going to relate to a were&#39;s libido... you are aware of that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;Peter told me... and I did confirm it with Moon Lake&#39;s guide...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in that there is nothing to be ashamed of or nervous over,&quot; Rich told her, &quot;our libido is much higher than the average human&#39;s... and I&#39;ve heard around everywhere that a were&#39;s favorite thing to do is have sex... but it&#39;s not a &quot;controlling&quot; thing. The only time when it will be a driving force with a were is in relation to a human completing their transformation into a were. In that once your transformation was completed, YOU gained complete control over your libido. It&#39;ll be high enough that... especially while you&#39;re still young... may be fairly easy to trigger some desires... it won&#39;t be something where you&#39;ll HAVE to have sex. In this, for many weres, it&#39;s more often that they&#39;re active because they consciously want to be active. If you don&#39;t want to, you can always say no and control yourself. It may be a &quot;self-control&quot; sort of thing... but you&#39;ll still have control.&quot;<br />
<br />
A deep roaring growl rumbled down the mountainside through the trees as they made their way back up toward Tara Strange&#39;s cabin, indicating that some of the other weres that lived outside of Moon Lake on this road were just getting started on their romantic adventures. It got Karen&#39;s tail twitching and a part of her was interested, but given the embarrassment at what had lead to her transformation the previous night and at being caught &quot;daydreaming,&quot; she took a deep breath and tried not to pay it that much attention. As while Oliver had seemed polite and curious, he was still pretty much a total stranger. And with some of her other background thoughts wondering if Peter would like her as a weretiger, she also figured it best not to push anything. She would keep herself in control until she was ready.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t too long before the group came back up to Tara Strange&#39;s cabin. Some of the sounds of the mating could easily be heard on Karen&#39;s ears and she had absentmindedly had a few more daydreams of herself joining in, some with Oliver, some with Rich, and some even with Peter. She&#39;d managed to keep quiet and walk along as she didn&#39;t want it to become something that lead to anything more embarrassing, particularly as she half expected her parents to be waiting for her. At the same time, she also expected that Rich and Olivia probably had some of their own plans that didn&#39;t involve Karen there, which she could understand, given that the other two weretigers seemed to be involved together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Rich said to Karen as she silently looked at the cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how will I turn back?&quot; Karen sighed, &quot;Since I&#39;d have to during the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just think on your human form,&quot; Olivia answered, &quot;focus on that form and being in that form... and your body will respond. And the same goes for taking on your fursona. Think on your present form and your desire to be in that form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen nodded, &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rich and Olivia slowly began to walk away arm in arm. Karen slowly made her way to the back door and noted that her clothing wasn&#39;t waiting for her on the back chair. However, she also caught her mother&#39;s scent there and guessed that her parents took her things in. She then turned to the door and made her way in, finding she had to duck down to fit through the doorway. The kitchen area was quiet and dark as she entered, but new eyes could easily see, almost as though it were still as bright as day. As such she made her way in and came across a piece of paper taped the wall in the doorway that lead to the living room. She carefully took it and found it to be a written note.<br />
<br />
The note read: &quot;Karen, please come see us when you return. We will be in the master bedroom.&quot; Karen shrugged and then ducked through the door to go up the stairs. She did so calmly, but for the moment held on to her new form. After all she was indoors and it was also night time, not to mention that she also guessed that her parents might be interesting in seeing a weretiger, and now that her actions from the previous night wouldn&#39;t be discovered it would be safe to approach her parents in her new form. As she ascended the staircase, however, she soon heard that the weres out in the woods weren&#39;t the only ones engaging in some lovemaking. She could hear a heavy and steady moan coming through the doorway to the master bedroom, which was shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooohhhhhh… oooohhhhh… I&#39;m sooooooo cloooooooooooooose, Moe,&quot; Karen heard her mother huskily moan out before a deeper grunting moan soon followed<br />
<br />
Karen couldn&#39;t help but smile at that, but stayed outside the door as she didn&#39;t want to watch her parents have sex. While she present felt fairly comfortable with being naked in her fursona, watching her parents have sex was not what she was looking for. She tapped one of her toes quietly and twitched her tail a bit while waiting, though it seemed to take a little while for them to finish and she could only hear her parents moan and the springs on the bed squeak as the two of them went at it. Eventually Karen lost her patience and called through the closed door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on you two, get that orgasm going,&quot; Karen called through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaa….&quot; came Moe&#39;s voice through the door before, &quot;yyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother was heard to give a similar startled sound that soon transitioned into a heavier moan that likely sounded like business was handled. It apparently took them a few moments before things could be certain that things were safe, and that was determined when Karen could hear the sound of two sets of feet on the floor. From there she simply opened the door and confidently walked in, making her parents jump as she entered. Both of them were still naked and Moe tried to hide his now softening equipment behind his hands<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen!&quot; Nichole stated with some surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your note said you wanted to see the new me,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;here I am... and if your concerned on nudity... remember that I&#39;m a bit bigger than I was now. My old clothes would be in tatters while I&#39;m in this form. And if you become one of the larger weres... so will it be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe and Nichole looked over to Karen and saw her standing just inside the door to the master bedroom. Moe actually had to look up to see his daughters presently greenish-yellow eyes with their round pupils as well as the pink triangle that was the nose at the end of her rounded muzzle. She stood on longer digitigrade legs with her tail slowly passing side to side. She was covered in largely orange fur with the exception of the inside of her ears, patches above her eyes, her neck, chest, belly, at the furry juncture between her legs, her inner thighs, and the underside of her arms. Over the top of all of this were black stripes that framed her eyes and muzzle, wrapped around her body and tail, and ran down her arms and legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Moe asked after a moment, unsure of what else to say and how to proceed with things given his nudity. He did recognize that if he and Nichole became weres and became larger ones that clothing made to fit people might be a problem, but for the moment he hadn&#39;t really thought that far.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m more than okay,&quot; Karen smiled, and figured to run the joke again while flexing her arms to show off her new biceps which were now not only well toned but actually bigger than Moe&#39;s were, &quot;I&#39;m grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole was silent for the moment as she looked to her daughter. Some of it was with a bit of jealousy, even if she was to understand the things that made weres different from normal human beings. But in addition to her height and added muscle mass, Karen&#39;s hips seemed a bit wider proportionately and her bust was also a bit bigger. At the very least she seemed to be a large C cup in her present form if not a small D, and a bit bigger than Nichole was. It made her strangely feel a bit jealous, especially as she knew that Karen was still growing, which could well mean that she&#39;d be even bigger in a year or two. Though, she really didn&#39;t want to say anything of that sort of thing at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Moe said after a moment or two, which Karen smiled to.<br />
<br />
She slowly approached and noted the clock on the nightstand reading 1:37 AM and moved to hug both of her parents and holding them tightly to her. There was some unease as all were technically naked, but despite covering rock hard abdominal muscles Karen&#39;s fur was rather soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that I&#39;m a were,&quot; Karen said slowly, &quot;we&#39;re in line with the city&#39;s laws... if you want to become weres, that&#39;s up to you and you can make that decision on your own time. And now that I&#39;m a weretiger, you don&#39;t have to worry about the Gambonis ever again. You are my family and I WILL protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen then lowered her head and nuzzled her muzzle to the top of Nichole and Moe&#39;s heads, which a way struck Nichole as more of a protective parent than anything else. But Karen&#39;s tone remained friendly and the hug was returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dear,&quot; Nichole managed and returned the hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... we may need to do some cleaning before we leave here,&quot; Karen spoke up, catching the heavy scent of sex in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll worry about that after the Gambonis are caught,&quot; Nichole answered.</p>
