<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neal had just gotten home from being with his second partner of the day, when he heard Blake closing the door to the bathroom.  He sighed to himself, wondering when he and Blake will get up again.  Neal remembered lately that his favorite person was getting almost no love since they moved in together, and he really thought the threesomes he set up would help lift Blake&#39;s mood.  However they seem to only make Blake a little more put out than intended.  <br />
<br />
The majority of time the other guy would fall into his arms or do more with him then Blake.  It only took four times for Neal to see that most guys, just went along with the idea so they could get a piece of him.  <br />
 <br />
After this last guy though Neal was starting to miss how Blake would touch him when they shared a partner.  Blake loved having a partner with a large round backside, and Neal did have that.  So when Neal did bring it up to Blake, he could see the lust form in Blake&#39;s eye but die just as quick. <br />
<br />
“No thanks.  I&#39;ll find someone,” Blake would reply.  <br />
<br />
After this night though Neal was more disappointed than normal.  His last hook up was cute in looks, but was much less spectacular in bed, leaving him very frustrated.  To get over his frustration, Neal went into his best friends room and turned on the PS4.  As the system turned on, Neal looked over at his friend&#39;s computer and noticed a UBS sticking out from it.  <br />
<br />
Curiosity slowly consumed Neal, and he quickly went over to the PC and looked to see what new device Blake picked up.  To his surprise he saw the Chronivac menu still up from its last use.  Looking over the menu, he noticed that it had a detailed report on him and his roommate.  <br />
<br />
Thankfully for Neal, the shower soon turned on, signaling he had about 20 minutes to look at the program before Blake came back into his room.  Acting swiftly, he began with the tab with his name on it.  It took a few seconds to verify that everything on page was correct.  After this he noticed that these stats were changeable.  He laughed to himself thinking if he could actually change his body Blake may want him more.  <br />
<br />
Just for a few laughs he changed his stats a bit.  Mostly adding more mass to his backside go up two pants sizes, and adding more muscle on his chest.  With a quick double click, Neal hit the save icon, and gave the computer a questioning look as message appeared.  <br />
<br />
“All changes will be completed in 5 minutes.  Would you like to make changes unnoticeable by other?”<br />
<br />
Neal thought that the question was odd but clicked yes just to see what the program would do.  <br />
<br />
A timer was now on the screen, and Neal began to feel some of his body start to warm up.  He ground his teeth as a slight pain over took most of his backside, then spread to his chest.  <br />
<br />
To his surprise his chest began to expand and push out from his body.  His shock showed on his face and he quickly put his hands on his butt to feel it too was growing and stretching his gym shorts.  After what seemed like forever his body stopped growing and the results astounded him.  Every little change Neal had input into the odd program, morphed his body into a masterpiece.  <br />
<br />
Neal smiled and nearly a million thoughts ran through his head.  He then sat in Blake&#39;s chair and began to investigate the program and the UBS.  His search soon showed him that the device could alter reality and there was almost no limit to the changes he could make.  He smiled to himself as a new train of thought rushed into his mind, but before he could do anything Blake walked into the room.  Blake&#39;s eyes landed on Neal, and he asked, “If your looking for porn again yup could have just asked.”<br />
<br />
Neal smiled and pushed away from the computer smiling.  “Sorry was waiting for the system to finish setting up,” was Neal&#39;s reply.  Blake didn&#39;t pay much attention as he finished drying off and fell into his bed.  This was a tempting display for Neal, but he had a plan to improve his and Blake&#39;s life.  However the first was to ensure Blake was asleep or left their apartment.  <br />
<br />
After a few hours Blake fell asleep in his bed and Neal quietly maneuvered to the computer and found the Chronivac program.  He quickly opened the program and started gathering his thoughts on how to best have fun with the reality altering device.  His first thought was to just have Neal become his lover, but the idea felt wrong to him.  If he was gonna have Neal, he&#39;d get him the old fashion way.  So instead he changed Neal&#39;s and his life&#39;s around.  <br />
<br />
The first alteration was to the jobs.  While Blake loved his job, he knew he was never going to be more than a assistant manger.  With swift key strokes he changed his job to GM of nice family center.  He also changed his education around so he could support the change of job and then turned his sights on Neal&#39;s life.  <br />
<br />
Blake knew exactly what would make Neal happy in this department.  Neal always talked about his dream job and now Blake was gonna make sure he had it.  He changed Neal into a computer science major and gave him a computer tech job.  Not only that but made him the best at his job, making him a very sought after individual.  Next on his list was to move them into a bigger and nicer apartment, since they now could afford it.  <br />
<br />
It took all of 2 minutes to find a new apartment that would satisfy Neal.  After these changes though Blake wanted something for himself, well two things.  Blake had a few notes added to Neal&#39;s data that he was more open minded to Blake&#39;s requests.  The other was to have his body grow whenever and whatever he worked out, though to everyone else he&#39;d always been huge.  <br />
<br />
Happy with the changes he made, he set the Chronivac to change everything overnight.</p>
