<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenna was walking towards the movie theatre, happy to meet up with Will again, but still troubled by her previous app usage. Had she changed her self by mistake? As she walked, Jenna carefully examined herself to see if she could notice any changes. As suspected, she couldn&#39;t tell anything was wrong. Her clothes were the same, her breasts were the same cup size, her hair was still long and blonde as ever, everything seemed fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t trust myself though.&quot; She thought frustrated. There was an option to look at the previous changes, bust she ultimately decided against it. &quot;You&#39;re a smart woman Jenna, you wouldn&#39;t do something stupid and change yourself. You probably just changed the store a little but since you were in it you couldn&#39;t see it... yeah I can buy that.&quot; She huffed before fixing her skirt as she noticed a couple of horny tween starring at her butt.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, her mind drifted away from such thought the second she saw her man walk out of the theatre. God, she loved him so much. His curly brown hair, his tight butt, he was Jenna&#39;s dream guy. She was so lucky to have him. The two embraced in a kiss, wrapping their arms around each other in joy.<br />
&quot;Hi love, how was the movie?&quot; Jenna asked with a giggle. She was a little taken aback by how bubbly her voice was, maybe that&#39;s what changed?<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; He said unenthusiastically. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I went in without you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, we&#39;ve been over this. I absolutely hate those kind of movies but I know you love them. I&#39;m not gonna get in the way of your fun. Now come on, we got a fun lunch date to get to.&quot; <br />
<br />
Will smiled as Jenna grabbed his hand and began leading him towards their double date with Kyle and Henrietta. Will always felt like such a lucky guy to have a girl like Jenna, but he wished he had someone who liked scary R rated movies as much as him. Still, he shouldn&#39;t complain, especially with how amazing the sex was. Jenna was a bit of a freak in bed, which Will simply loved.<br />
<br />
Jenna, meanwhile, was having thoughts about the app again. &quot;Should I tell Will about it?&quot; She kept thinking to herself. They ended up passing the karate studio, seeing that they were all done and chatting about something serious. Jenna was able to piece together that one of the woman had actually gone into labor and had been rushed off to the hospital. <br />
<br />
The power Jenna had was unbelievable. Just thinking about it all made her panties get a little wet. She decided not to tell Will, as he may not understand, or want to change things himself. Besides, it&#39;s not like he was aware of any changes so no one would care anyway right?<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, they finally met up with Henrietta and Kyle. Henrietta gave Jenna a big hug while Kyle gave Will his signature noogie. Henrietta was a little bit of an air headed brunette, but they became best friends back on the cheer squad in higshcool. Kyle and Will had been friends even longer than that!<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like, so good to see you Jen!&quot; Henrietta laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You too girl.&quot; Jenna chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up you bloody moron?&quot; Kyle laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good to see you to Kyle.&quot; Will sighed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 4 of them walked into the restaurant together, chatting about some of their goofier memories before they were suddenly stopped by a very grumpy looking man behind a computer. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry children, but I&#39;ll have to ask you if you have reservations this evening?&quot; He asked condescendingly. &quot;As you can see, we are heavily booked tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
They looked out and saw that most of the tables were filled with a bunch of older men in business suits, chatting quietly about nonsense. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well no we don&#39;t have a reservation but-&quot; Will started to explain before he was interrupted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to wait quite a bit longer.&quot; He said with a fake sad expression. <br />
<br />
&quot;But there are clearly some tables opened!&quot; Kyle complained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I&#39;m afraid this is a very important meeting, no place for children.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four college students felt defeated as they walked over to the seating area, not knowing just how long they&#39;d have to sit. As Kyle, Henrietta, and Will began to complain to themselves, Jenna secretly pulled out her phone to fix the situation.<br />
<br />
She opened the app and it quickly generated sentence after selecting one of the business men. &quot;A very bored man sitting in a nice restaurant.&quot; She thought a few different word changes could definitely work, but quickly remembered what happened last time she tried to change something she was in, and she was in the restaurant. If she was going to fix this, she&#39;d need a sentence that wouldn&#39;t accidentally change herself.<br />
<br />
After a few reloads, she finally got one that was perfect. &quot;Sam is a member of the board.&quot; <br />
&quot;There we go.&quot; She thought. &quot;This is just bland enough to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
She changed &quot;board&quot; to &quot;PTA&quot; and looked up to find a very different scene. The restaurant was now filled with groups of middle aged women, some of which had younger children running around them. Sam, the man Jenna had selected, was now a female version of himself, currently nursing a baby on her new large breasts.<br />
<br />
Jenna smiled to herself, especially after seeing how uncomfortable the grumpy old man looked. Jenna also realized she was suddenly standing instead of sitting in the waiting area. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your table is ready.&quot; A cheery waitress said as she gestured towards an empty table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you mum.&quot; Will happily replied before beginning to follow her.<br />
<br />
Jenna, however, waited a moment, as she decided to teach the man one final lesson. She selected him, and a sentence appeared that read &quot;This man is distracting himself with a computer.&quot; Jenna figured he was trying to hide his frustration at so many &quot;children&quot; around him. She immediately knew exactly the punishment for him s she changed man to child.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the grumpy old man was a fat, grumpy looking toddler who was trying to reach the computer. He looked a lot like his sold self, but now was clearly barely old enough to talk. Suddenly, one of the parents at the PTA group noticed him and yelled &quot;No Andrew!&quot; Before walking over to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about this.&quot; The older redhead sighed as she dragged the now crying child away.<br />
<br />
Jenna just laughed to herself before following her group to the table. She sat down and began to wonder what to do next.</p>
