<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the liquor began to dull their senses, the sight of seeing scales on their bodies and a few of the men displaying an androgynous look bordering on female, the girls started to feel more loose and were all eyeing the closed patio door. All were eager to head outside to the patio and avail themselves the use of the diving board. A feature that allowed the bar patrons to have late night dips in the ocean, during the warmer summer days. As it was November and well into the fall season, the patio was shut down for the season, yet that wasn’t going to stop the ten soon to be transformed mer-folk from leaving the club and having a wild romp in the sea. With them pacing about in the common pool and heading back to the hot they congregated at, the club patrons and most staff were well and truly infected; Caroline and the rest reasoned that none would try to stop them once the ocean breeze flowed into the space.<br />
<br />
The twins Iris and Violet both continue to enjoy the playful petting they were receiving from both a black and Hispanic man respectively. Iris’s man was looking like the peak of physical fitness for a male, while Violet’s mate was looking more feminine with each passing minute. His chest already looking puffy and his caramel colored face looking soft with the mass of black hair cascading down from his scalp. Like several of the other men, his body was now absent of any hair below head. Only Iris’s and Carloine’s man were looking more masculine. Like Violet, Jean and Judy’s boy toys were looking more female.<br />
<br />
“I think we should make a break for it,” Iris sighing as the black man named Greg pulled his hand out of her bikini bottom; Iris clearly enjoying Greg probing her entrance with his fingers.<br />
“I thought we were waiting for the fog machines,” Greg answering as he finishes off his third drink; “so no one tries to stop us.”<br />
“I don’t think I can wait,” Judy fidgeting in the hot tub; the itch she was experiencing was getting uncomfortable to the point she wanted to scratch herself raw to the point where blood may draw.<br />
“My legs are starting to feel like jelly,” the man next to Caroline stumbling to sit on the edge of the hot tub as he got up.<br />
<br />
Everyone stared and notice the greyish blue scales on his legs and his feet looking more flipper like. While this would elicited screams and shouts of fear, none in the hot tub looked concerned or batted an eye; the mermaid virus that has infected every cell in their bodies has already altered their minds to accept their impending transformation.<br />
“Alright,” Judy looking at the man and feeling an intense need to ride his cock; “let’s go before my legs give out as well. To hell with the fog,” Judy getting up and her legs are already displaying a blend of orange, red and yellow scales.”<br />
“Let me help you Adam,” Caroline helping the blonde hair man up; his freckles and youthful appearance now gone and in its place a rugged and chiseled physique with an impressive eight pack of abs.<br />
“Fuck this swimsuit is getting tight,” a man spoke up; his voice sounding higher in pitch as he waded out of the hot tub.<br />
“We’ll chuck them off once we get to the ocean,” Jean taking up the rear.<br />
<br />
They get to the door with little issue. As most in the pools were more concerned with the current company, few if any payed attention as ten people quickly opened an door that was foolishly left unlocked and did their best to run to the diving board. Once they started jumping off did a few take notice of the open door. By the time the last left and was already shouting for joy as she fell into waves below, the one lone staff that wasn’t infected quickly closed the door and locked it.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Caroline shivered with joy as the cool salt water surrounded her body like a comforting blanket. Letting herself sink to the bottom as the riptide dragged her and the rest to deeper water. Caroline expels the air in her lungs and then inhales the water. Instead of gaging and her body flailing from lack of oxygen, gills suddenly appeared on her neck and back and flared as water began passing through them. She rips off the bikini she had on and stares at the blonde haired man that swam up to her. Without words he locked lips with her and engaged in a deep and passionate kiss. Caroline’s hands trail down to Adam’s waist and she rips off the speedo he was given to wear; freeing his already hard shaft.<br />
<br />
Unaware that his balls have already become intern, Adam pins Caroline to the sandy bottom of the beach they were in. He doesn’t give Caroline a chance to speak as he spears her with his member and starts to rhythmically thrust into her. Their legs closing in together as they lengthen into a long scaly appendage ending in a fin. For Caroline the fin was a horizontal similar to that of a whale fluke, only more translucent. Adam’s fin was vertical, looking shark like and a dorsal fin going out of his back were scale and flesh meet were his ass once was. A pair of claspers grow to help him grip the mermaid’s tail below as his now internal cock begins to twitch and spurt his seed into Caroline’s hungry womb. Both finally open their eyes as there orgasms subside to see each other fully for the first time.<br />
<br />
Caroline was now sporting a long tail replete with jade green scales; its length making her a solid ten feet in height when rising to the surface or diving underwater. Adam’s tail was clearly shark like as the bluish grey scales transition into an off white for his tail’s underside. His vent for his penis was being guard by two small fins that were his strong claspers. Both has webbed hands and scales speckled all along their body. Both smiled as they lazily drifted along the ocean floor.<br />
“You think we should look for the rest or just go for another round,” Caroline cooed; her voice sounding different underwater but clearly audible to her’s and Adam’s new hearing.<br />
“Yes,” Adam flicking his tail; turning around to see that despite it being night, he could see in the water with relative ease. Noticing several shape not far from them, he makes a move towards them; gliding with ease in the water and able to fight against the rip tide that dragged them out to deep waters.<br />
<br />
What he saw made his internal cock stiffen and rise from his vent. Seeing his male friends turned into mermaids and Greg still deep into Iris; the mer-man felt an urge to take claim one of the mermaids. Pinning her down and asserting dominance, he quickly penetrated her and started to thrust and mate with her. Meanwhile Caroline swam up to Violet and her former Hispanic man now a mermaid and started a threeway with them. Their acrobatic rolling was soon joined by both Adam and the mermaid that was once a man; the same mermaid the Adam was mating with. It soon devolved into a massive orgy as four mermaids were actively allowing the mer-man to enter and inseminate each of them.<br />
<br />
“Will we get pregnant,” the once male named Jacob question sounding more of a shout between thrusts as Adam came in him yet again; his virility knowing no bounds at the moment. Both enjoying another orgasmic release between the two <br />
“I hope so,” Violet gasping; her words coming in slowly as she gulps huge mouthfuls of water, out of breath as she looks at her entrance; puffed, puckered and leaking copious amounts of seed. She turns her head to see Andre sighing as Caroline was suckling on of her breasts while sticking her fingers into the blue and yellow scaled mermaid’s entrance. “I want a child to help grow our pod,” Violet crawling to the two to assist the now Hispanic mermaid the joys of being female.<br />
“I wonder what is happening to those at the club,” Adam helping his former friend, now mate to Caroline, Violet and Jacob; ”what name should we call you as Jacob is a male’s name and you are clearly no longer of that gender.”<br />
“Jay,” the Hispanic mermaid gasping as her entrance quivers and expels a translucent fluid.<br />
“We have a squirter,” Caroline grinning as she passes the mermaid off to Adam so he can mate with her next, but not before she takes a quick sample of her pod sister&#39;s honey. “we should get some rest,” Caroline starting to yawn; “we can assess the situation in the morning. And leave your sister be, Violet,” Caroline guiding the purple scaled mermaid to be with Adam and the rest; “Iris and the rest seem to be enjoying Greg’s virility.”</p>
