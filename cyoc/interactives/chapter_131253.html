<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I trudged back inside and sat on the couch. “Woof” it was Sarah barking at me. She scurried to the back door and scratched it. I followed her to the back door and opened it. She put her nose to the ground and like a blood hound traced the route Jenna had taken to the back fence. I got it, she could follow Jenna’s route by smell. I picked her up and lifted her over the fence she wiggled out of my hands and fell to the ground. I hoped she wasn’t hurt. I needed to follow her or should I say him. I couldn’t jump the fence in this body. I remembered Rod’s ladder and took it from the backyard shed, put it against the back fence and climbed to the top. It was a 5ft drop and I was hesitant. But I was also desperate. I took the jump and landed safely even if I did sprawl on the ground. <br />
<br />
Sarah came and licked me then started following the scent. I followed him to the road where he turned right. We followed the scent along the footpath around the block back to the front of our house. Sarah briefly entered the front garden did a circle around Rod’s car then continued following the scent down the street. I followed behind him eventually we came to the local shops and to the local pub. Sarah stopped at the door to the public bar. “In there?” he licked my sandaled feet. <br />
<br />
“You stay outside I’ll see if I can find him”<br />
<br />
I entered the bar. I soon saw Jenna sitting on a stool by the main bar. He had a schooner in his hand and was talking to a dubious looking fellow beside him. He saw me as I approached <br />
<br />
“Here she is, No doubt come to beg me to come back” He got off the stool came across and roughly kissed me. His hands grabbed my arse. “She’s a looker eh”  <br />
<br />
All I managed to say was “You have to come home now” I grabbed him by the hand and tried to pull him to the door. He easily pulled away from me.<br />
<br />
“I’ll come home when I want. First I’m going to finish my beer. You get home and put on something sexy, be ready for me when I get there. With that he gave my bum a slap and sent me back towards the door” Feeling humiliated I left. <br />
<br />
Sarah was outside and greeted me with a lick. I started walking back towards home and related what had happened as we walked. It felt strange talking to a dog and getting responses at appropriate times. I knew he was still Sarah inside.<br />
<br />
We eventually got back to the house and let the real Biddy back in. He barked with excitement and again both dogs smelt each other’s bums in greeting. I would have to ask Sarah about that when she changed back……If she changed back.<br />
<br />
I sat on the couch and waited. Hoping that Jenna would return. Sarah sat on my lap and I gently fondled her. Biddy soon joined us and I ended up with 2 puppies asleep with their heads on my lap.<br />
<br />
About an hour later the front door opened and to my relief it was Jenna. “Where is the medallion? We have to change her back!”<br />
<br />
“You told me we had to wait 12 hours. She can be a dog until the morning” She looked at me with a drunken leer. “I told you to put on something sexy. If you want the medallion you do as I say”<br />
<br />
Sarah was growling at him. “Put those dogs out for the night” Sarah lunged at him and bit at his leg. He kicked and Sarah fell heavily against the wall whimpering. “Put them out now before I decide to whip them” <br />
<br />
I quickly picked up Sarah and took her to the back door and called Biddy to follow. I lay him/her down on Biddy’s basket and Biddy crawled in beside her. I whispered “I don’t see that I have a choice but to do what he says” Sarah licked my hand.<br />
<br />
Sarah’s phone was ringing in her handbag when I re-entered. Jenna beat me to it. She answered “Hi Eileen, Sarah can’t answer at the moment. What’s up?” ……………… “Oh Jenna’s around here at the moment. She can stay the night in the guest room” ………..”Appointment in the morning? Oh I can drop her back home before I go to work” ……………… “Sarah’s fine, she has just gone to bed early” …………”Ok goodnight. I’ll see you in the morning”<br />
<br />
He grinned at me. “We mustn’t forget your psychiatric appointment in the morning Jenna. I’m sure Sarah can lend you something nice to wear” <br />
<br />
He went to the bedroom and I could hear him going through the cupboards. <br />
<br />
He came back out “I have put some clothes on the bed. Go and put them on” He went to the fridge and pulled out one of my beers. ”Go on…. If you want your girlfriend back you are going to do everything I say”<br />
<br />
I went to the bedroom. On the bed was the black chemise Rhonda had bought last weekend. I didn’t see that I had any choice but to strip off the clothes I was wearing and put on the chemise. I kept Jenna’s panties on. <br />
<br />
From the other room Jenna yelled “Hurry up and get back out here girl. I want to see what you look like. I hesitantly left the bedroom and stood in front of him. “Turn around” I did so. He leered at me. “You have a panty line. Go and put a G-String on. I know Sarah has some”<br />
<br />
I went back to the bedroom and found the G-String I had worn to the Cocktail dinner. Reluctantly I changed the panties for the G-String. “Get back out here. You’ve had long enough” I came out and stood in front of him. “Turn around again” I did so “Pull up your top and show me the G-String” I did “Turn around” I did so, he was now looking at my G-string clad bum. “Very nice, But your hair is a mess. Go and brush your hair and put on some lipstick. I only fuck classy girls”<br />
<br />
I went to the bathroom found Sarah’s hair brush and brushed my long blond locks. I found Sarah’s red lipstick and put some on. I didn’t think I had any choice but to comply. I had to get him to reveal where the medallion was. It could see no sign of it but it could be hiding under his shirt. I would have to try and seduce him.<br />
<br />
I knew from my years as a male that I was currently extremely hot. I looked like a teenage boy’s fantasy. I stepped back out into the lounge. <br />
<br />
“Very nice” he said “Get me some of your whiskey. On the rocks” I went to the kitchen and put some ice in a glass. Then topped the glass up with whiskey. It was a bigger glass than I would normally pour but thought getting him drunk might make him more compliant.<br />
He had moved to couch and I handed him the drink. “Hmmm is this the best whiskey you have”<br />
<br />
“It is the only whiskey I have” <br />
<br />
“It will do” He swallowed half the glass. “Dance for me. A sexy dance” I began to sway in front of him “Turn around as you dance” I did so. I had no choice.<br />
<br />
“Another drink …. Keep those hips swaying as you get it”<br />
<br />
I swayed back to the kitchen and poured him another large glass of whiskey<br />
<br />
When I returned I handed him the glass. He took a swig. “I feel like a blow job” He stood up. “Kneel and give me your best”<br />
<br />
“Do you promise to give me the medallion if I do?” <br />
<br />
“I will change Sarah back in the morning but only If I’m satisfied with your performance”<br />
<br />
Should I trust him? The idea of a penis in my mouth was disgusting to my male mind. However the female body I inhabited was turned on. My nipples were enlarged and I could feel I was very moist down below. If I refused what would happen? I suspected I would be raped and he may not change Sarah back. If I complied he might be more likely to accede to my requests. <br />
<br />
Reluctantly I got to my knees. Jenna’s hands had long vivid red nails. As if in a dream I watched those hands, currently mine, reach for the crotch in front of me. They undid the button and zip on the shorts he had on. The shorts dropped to the floor. The boxer shorts were the same ones I had put on in the morning they now tented out in front of me, the penis inside straining against the material to escape. I watched as those feminine hands pulled down the boxers. The penis sprang free. It was the same one I had sported on and off over the last 3 weeks. It was swollen and purple with excitement. From my current angle it appeared to be bigger than I could recall.<br />
<br />
The nail clad fingers were fondling the penis. It was as if they had a mind of their own. I pretended I was still the owner of the engorged organ and was watching as it was been fondled by a sexy female. In my mind I watched as her tongue caressed the sides, the sexy hands gently cupped the scrotum and the lips encircled the penis head. It was salty, it was pushing in deeper. I was gagging. I tried to pull off but his hands were now at the back of my head holding me in place. He was bucking into me, my mouth was filled with warm fluid. He was groaning in delight. Slowly the penis went limp. He released my head and I withdrew. <br />
<br />
“Swallow it you little slut” I felt humiliated. I gulped and swallowed what had not already gone down my throat. <br />
<br />
“Now you can wash your mouth out and get me another drink” I quickly fled to the bathroom and tried to vomit out what I had swallowed. When finished I repeatedly rinsed out my mouth until the taste of semen was gone. <br />
<br />
“Where’s my drink?” I came out and gave him another whiskey. “I’m feeling hungry. Go and get me a pizza. A meat lovers”<br />
<br />
I rang and ordered a pizza from the local shop. It was just down the road near the pub. It would be ready in 15 minutes “Can I change?” <br />
He looked at me “Yeah, put on the clothes you were wearing earlier but keep the G-String”<br />
<br />
I changed back into Jenna’s clothes. Found some cash in Sarah’s bag and it was time to go to the shop. “Don’t dally I’m hungry”<br />
<br />
I took Sarah’s car and drove down to the shop. Should I go to the police? They wouldn’t believe me and I would be locked up in a mental asylum. Without the medallion I couldn’t prove who I was. I collected the Pizza and reluctantly drove back. <br />
<br />
Jenna took the pizza off me when I re-entered. “Get a plate and you can have one piece. You have to watch your figure”<br />
<br />
I ate my piece while he scoffed down the rest. I asked “Can I go and check on Sarah?” He waved me a way dismissively. I immediately went outside before he changed his mind. Sarah was still where I had left her. She looked at me and whimpered. I sat down on the ground beside the basket. Biddy jumped on me. “Down Biddy” I patted him gently until he calmed. ”How are you Sarah, are you hurt?” he licked me. I gently felt him over. He whimpered when I touched his hind right leg. “Do you think it’s broken?” No response. “I guess that means you don’t know” He licked me. <br />
<br />
I related what had happened inside and found myself crying when I retold about the blow job. Sarah growled quietly. I sat there in the dark stroking Sarah as she lay there in the basket. “I don’t know what to do”<br />
<br />
Probably 20 minutes later I heard Jenna inside “Get back here bitch” Reluctantly I got up and went back inside. “Get rid of this rubbish and get me another drink” He indicated the Pizza box in front of him. I picked it up and put it in the bin. <br />
<br />
“A whiskey or something else Jenna?”<br />
<br />
“Another whiskey” I went and poured him another drink. “How long does this take to be ready again?” He indicated the penis. <br />
<br />
What do I say “It depends you just need to get aroused” <br />
<br />
He thought for a minute “Address me as Rod. You are now Jenna. If you want your sister back you had better arouse me” Shit it sounds like he wants this to be permanent. <br />
<br />
What do I do? “How do I know you will stick to your word?” <br />
<br />
“The way I see it you have no choice. I have the medallion. I want to be aroused. If I am satisfied I will turn Sarah back into her true form in the morning. You however are going to remain Jenna and go to my appointment tomorrow. You get me cleared and I might swap back” <br />
<br />
Shit how long does she mean? “What do you mean by cleared?”<br />
<br />
“I am being assessed tomorrow. If the psychologist says I am recovered the court will let me off”.<br />
<br />
“Recovered from what?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t really know. Compulsive stealing? They think I’m mad……I think you just need to prove to them that I am not a threat to society. That I will not re-offend”<br />
<br />
“That might be difficult for me to do given the current circumstances”<br />
<br />
“Well girl it will be you going to jail or the asylum not me………. So how do you intend to arouse me?”<br />
<br />
I went to the bedroom and sat down on the bed I had to think. I knew as a former male what I liked. I had looked good in the chemise I had worn earlier. Frankly it was hard to imagine looking sexier than I had been earlier. But what turned me on as a male more than anything was a female in orgasm. A female who looked like she was in ecstasy. A female who was actually enjoying having sex with you. Could I fake it? I had heard that women faked it. I don’t think Sarah ever faked it but I wasn’t 100% certain. I wasn’t sure that I could pull that off. Jenna would know how this body reacted in orgasm. She would surely know if I was faking it. <br />
<br />
So that left the real thing. What turned this body on? I really didn’t know. I knew a bit more about Sarah’s body and a little bit about Rhonda’s. Clitoral stimulation should do the trick. What about Norman? I could get him out of his hiding place. Maybe not. A fake penis is a turnoff when you are male. <br />
<br />
For a start I decided to put the chemise back on, leaving only the G-string underneath. I slipped into the bathroom, Jenna was now watching TV and didn’t even notice. I brushed the long locks again and reapplied lipstick, I even applied eye shadow and touched up my brows as Angie had shown me. I put on a spray of Sarah’s perfume. I realized I was turned on just looking in the mirror. I can do this I thought. If only it was Sarah in Rod’s body not Jenna then it would be easy. That’s it, I had to pretend it was Sarah in there. Get Jenna totally out of my mind. Sarah, Sarah beautiful Sarah. I was making love to Sarah in Rod’s body. I had done it before and reached the heights of ecstasy. I would do it again right now.<br />
<br />
I came out of the bathroom. I moved to the couch and sat down beside ‘Sarah’ I had to think of him as Sarah. He was about to say something but I put my fingers to my lips and said “Shhh. No talking” I turned the TV off, he didn’t object. I sat on his lap. I bought his hand across onto my lap and I kissed ‘Sarah’ on the mouth. I rubbed my hand on his arms, on his shoulders. I stood up and pulled him up with me I placed one of his hands on my breast and kissed him again. Sarah, Sarah, I kept saying in my mind.<br />
<br />
I led him into the main bedroom. I undressed him, I took off his shirt, his shorts leaving him only in his boxers. I thought to myself, Sarah, touch me I’m hot. I moved his other hand so he could feel the front of my G-String the part covering my pubes, through the chemise. My nipples were erect and begging to be touched. I bought his head down to my chest and as I hoped, felt ‘Sarah’s’ tongue circling my left nipple, then my right. I reached down and felt his boxers, he was responding. I pulled off the chemise and pulled him down on the bed on top of me. I kissed him again then arched my back so that his face was now in my chest. I felt him lick my nipples again. He bit them gently, I winced, but I was turned on. I was soaked. “Do whatever you like” I whispered. I pushed his head lower his tongue found my belly button, I pushed him lower still and parted my legs further, his tongue was tracing the edge of the panties. “Get them off” He pulled back slightly and pulled them all the way down, over my ankles. Suddenly he was kissing me again, on my shins, my knees my inner thighs. Slowly, slowly, that magic tongue worked its way up. Finally it got there, I felt it caress my clitoris, It gently slipped into my vagina and lapped up some of the fluid. Then it was back to the clitoris. I was there. I was squirming. I was moaning. “Now” I whispered. His tongue left me, he climbed on top of me. I felt the penis push into me “More” I said. He was most certainly aroused. He was pushing right in, all the way in. In and out. In and Out. Another wave of orgasms hit me. I was moaning again. He exploded inside me. I lay there and hugged ‘Sarah’ to me. <br />
<br />
As I felt the limp penis exit my vagina he said “That was good. Very, very, good” Soon afterwards he was asleep.<br />
<br />
I slipped out of bed, quietly retrieved a nightie and panties and went down to the guest bedroom. I didn’t want to wake up next to him in the morning. I now knew he didn’t have the medallion on him. He must have hidden it somewhere.</p>
