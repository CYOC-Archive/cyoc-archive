<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer woke up feeling even tired than before. She groggily looked at her phone, it was just past noon. Jennifer groaned as she hoped it was a weekend. Flipping off her covers she made a shocking discovery, laid next to her were a small collection of sex toys, from smile makers to dildos, one of which was in definitely in the shape of a knot. She looked around the bed, she could feel she wasn&#39;t wearing any panties before she even saw, and she hoped the sweat stains on her sheets were something other than her flicking the bean. <br />
<br />
Standing up she looked over her room, it had gotten even messier, it looked like she lived in it, laundry was drapped over the bed, on the floor, she wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if something was found hanging on the ceiling fan. Old take-out containers sat on her computer desk, along with old wrappers and bags from handheld snacks and chips each with a matching empty bottle of soda or similar beverage. The only thing more concerning than that were the few bottles of mismatched lables under the desk near the leg filled with a yellowish liquid. Jennifer recoiled from the sight. Her computer chair had changed too, from a simple office chair to a full blown gamer chair. The desktop had also gotten an upgrade, looking like a computer from a ad or some gaming store, complete with led lighting.<br />
<br />
Jennifer shook her head at all the changes, deciding to finally take a look at herself in the mirror. Her mouth fell open as she gazed at the person in the reflection. Jennifer had certainly gotten older, she was officially sixteen. Jennifer didn&#39;t look any taller, maybe 4&#39;11 was going to be her new height, she was already getting used to looking up to people these last few days. What was worse was the rest of her body. Hair covered her, her forearms had a visible length of hair, same with her legs, even a few stray hairs on her chest. Her happy trail had grown even more, now extended just slightly past her naval, and much much wider. She could no longer see her vagina in the reflection, just a black ball of pubes. Jennifer reached down to pull apart her folds, finding the pubes still damp from previous activities, or perhaps already salivating for the next. Her ass was not save either as her pubes extended all the way around. Her pits were so thick they were visible even if she closed her arms tight, she truly had never shaved in her life. The only thing else was how pale she had gotten, she looked like a hairy vampire. <br />
<br />
Jennifer grabbed her phone to check the date, it was a Tuesday. Why wasn&#39;t she in school? Jennifer looked her schoolbag but didn&#39;t see it anywhere. Quizzically Jennifer turned on the moniter of her computer, there were a lot of issues, who leaves smut just open on their screen? Clicking it away she saw a tab that explained everything. Her heart hit the bottom of her stomach when she saw the site for a G.E.D., she was only sixteen and she had dropped out completely from school. Jennifer grabbed a pair of pajama pants that were laying on the ground and put them on as she climbed up the basement stairs.<br />
<br />
The top of the house still looked the same, spotless and cared for, her mother was sitting on the living room couch watching some TV. &quot;Goodmorning Jen, how lucky I am to actually see you these days, how&#39;s the studying?&quot; She said completely innocently. <br />
<br />
Jennifer blushed as she unsuredly replied &quot;Good, I was just seeing how you were doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother smiled &quot;Ah you&#39;re so sweet, give me a hug.&quot; As she stood up and walked over, wrapping her arms around Jennifer. Jennifer felt weird getting squeezed as she squirmed her way from the hug. &quot;Sorry, I just-&quot; Jennifer tried to excuse herself before her mother interjected. &quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry, I forgot you don&#39;t do hugs no more.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her mom took a step back as she looked at Jen. &quot;Oh you might want to tie up your pants if you plan on walking around the house, I don&#39;t think the neighbors want to see that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer looked down as her face turned red, she had forgotten to tie the pajama strings, the waistband had grown loose as she accidently was flashing her mother the top of her pubes. &quot;Oh my god! I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Jennifer stumbled as she hastily grabbed the waistband with one hand as she ran back down to the safety of her lair.<br />
<br />
In her room Jennifer looked at the GED site, all she had done was just create the account, none of the actual lessons were completed, though one was started....four months ago, it was still open. The bulk of the computer was filled with video games, porn games, a digital sketch pad, and folders of smut. Jennifer was confused on what she was supposed to be doing all day, clearly herself must had been doing something.<br />
<br />
The anxiety started to return as Jennifer started to breath heavy as her thoughts turned on herself. As the choir of blame mounted further she reached over from her chair to her bed to grab a dildo. Sinking into her chair abit she spread her legs as she teased herself with it as she starred at the computer screen. One hand was manipulating the device, the other her mouse as she clicked through art or sites for images to flood her imagine of sex. While the dildo became lost in her pubes, she found she was able to clear her head again. She curled her stomach as she orgasmed, pulling out the dildo as she blushed that she had unknowingly grabbed the non-human one. A small bit of drool seeped from her pubes as it dribbled to the chair. From her momentary clarity from pleasure she picked up her tablet and started to draw. Of course it was more porn, but it was something. Jennifer paused every few minutes to take a break to masterbate herself, all while updating message boards and responding to anonymous emails. She was a porn artist apparently, her profile picture showing a little raccoon girl who looked somewhat similar to Jennifer, probably on purpose. This was what she did now, and her mind grew complicit, as for once, the stress of her life, work, school, the curse, it all melted away. Jennifer only wished it would never change.</p>
