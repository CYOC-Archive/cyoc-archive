<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was not only miserable, but he also felt like he was trapped in a nightmare. Five days ago, he had watched as his penis and testicles shrunk and then disappeared into the genitalia of a female.<br />
<br />
And if that wasn't bad enough, he had started to bleed from the vaginal opening; something that totally confused Paul.<br />
<br />
Not understanding what was happening was normal, he had returned to work, only to be distracted by thoughts of what he thought was a real cute man that worked in some other division.<br />
<br />
Not liking this train of thought, uncomfortable with how his body suddenly felt, he tried to focus first on his secretary and when that didn't work, the project he was supposed to be working on for the firm his boss had finally gotten the contract for.<br />
<br />
Unable to even do this, he decided to take a sick day and went home...where everything only got worse.<br />
<br />
Home, glad that Tanya wasn't there yet, he thought about his current problem, but the only solution Paul could think of was that every time Tanya said she felt like this, she went to the bathroom, took some pill and then...well he really didn't know what she did. &quot;But she did something,&quot; Paul told himself as he walked toward the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, he shut the door and began to search the medicine cabinet. After a few minutes, he found a box of Midol and reading the side, he read that it was for the cramped and bloated feeling that came with the menstrual cycle.<br />
<br />
Confused, wondering what a menstrual cycle was, he took two of the pills and decided that what he wanted was a hot shower and to sit around in nothing more than a pair of sweats, watching a movie and eating something both greasy and salty. Instead, he searched the bathroom a bit more and eventually found, under the sink, the pads that Tanya used every time it was her time of the month.<br />
<br />
Reading the package, confused about what he was reading, he took one out and looking at it, realised that there was no way it would fit in the boxers he wore.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he went to the room he shared with Tanya and poking about, Paul eventually found a pair of Bikini briefs in his wife's top drawer. As he took them out, it dawned on him that he not only knew this style of underwear, but also the other style that his wife normally wore when it wasn't her time of the month.<br />
<br />
Confused, looking at the thongs, thinking how comfortable they could be, Paul silently told himself, &quot;Stop it,&quot; and shut the dresser drawer.<br />
<br />
Returning to the bathroom, he shed his clothes, and looking at the bloody mess that was his boxers, he threw them into the garbage can and ran the shower. Afterwards, slightly disturbed because he had enjoyed the feeling of the water on his body, Paul had dressed in his wife's underwear and a pad and then walking back to the bedroom, he pulled on a pair of his sweat pants and an oversized shirt.<br />
<br />
Now, five days later, he was bent over at the waist, genitalia and butt fully exposed to the mirror in the bathroom, Paul looked at the pinkish-white gash between his legs and the noted that his butt looked a little rounder. &quot;Almost feminine,&quot; Paul thought as he stood back up.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, noting that the amount of hair on his naked body had decreased, he thought that the one good thing was that he was no longer bleeding and silently hoped that whatever had caused it had been a fluke. Sighing again, he turned one direction and then another, was for some reason disappointed about his appearance, shrugged and reached for the clothes he had selected before his morning shower.<br />
<br />
These were another problem Paul saw. About four days ago, his male clothes had vanished and these female clothes had appeared in their place. Clothes that Paul noticed showed off his body and accented just the right places...something he couldn't make up his mind if he really liked or was deeply disturbed by.<br />
<br />
Sighing yet again, he slowly began to dress, all the while listening to see if Tanya was up yet...another matter he was confused about, because she acted like nothing was out of place.<br />
------<br />
<br />
From where she lay in bed, Tanya listened as Paul moved about in the bathroom. Smiling, she thought back on the past five days, enjoying the sight of Paul wriggling about like a worm on a hook. Liking how she kept catching him looking at himself in the mirror whenever he thought nobody was around. How he walked like a female, but was obviously trying not to. How he kept staring at men, and then when he saw Tanya, he would get all self-conscious, blush and turn away.<br />
<br />
Tanya thought about all off this and more. She thought about how she had taken all his clothes and switched them for woman's clothing...which surprised her because they changed size and appearance about two days later.<br />
<br />
She thought about how Paul looked without his clothes, something she had accidentally seen. &quot;Thank god Paul is unaware that I know what he looks like naked,&quot; Tanya thought as she lay in bed.<br />
<br />
Thinking about all of this, Tanya thought about how Paul's body was slowly developing like a girl's would when she went through puberty. After a bit, she slowly got out of bed and walking toward the closet, she reached in and withdrew several items...items that she hoped would drive Paul up the wall when he found out how feminine he was not only acting, but also becoming.<br />
<br />
Placing the items back where she had them hidden, Tanya stood and as the bathroom door opened, she grabbed a towel and feigning sleepiness, she slid past Paul, muttering, &quot;Morning,&quot; but grinning when she saw how cute he looked in the shorts he was wearing and the tight belly shirt he had on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So cute and accented in just the right ways to get all the boys attention,&quot; Tanya thought as she began to run the shower.</p>
