<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You walked with Liana through the woods, and eventually saw a carriage with two horses, and a man holding both of them, and standing along a dirt road. &quot;A carriage?&quot; You asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, oh I forgot to tell you something important. I&#39;m an heir to the throne in my parents kingdom. Don&#39;t freak out too much.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;Your a princess?&quot; You asked with a shocked expression, and Liana nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Liana,&quot; a new voice said and a man in a cloak walked over towards you. <br />
<br />
You immediately covered your breasts and vagina somewhat embarrassed that you were naked. &quot;Lady Liana, I see that your summoning was successful. Were there any complications?&quot; The man asked<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a....gender mishap and I accidentally turned myself familiar female.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, but she seems to have forgiven you considering that she is still here.&quot; The man said, and you nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s still adjusting, but she&#39;s been great so far.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;Most are, and be not worried about your nudity. All familiars are nude when summoned, but of course you will get clothes that will be requisitioned to you. By the way, my name is Roed, I am the head wizard and am the one responsible for Lady Liana&#39;s magical training. So, what name has Lady Liana given you?&quot; The man, Roed asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh...&quot; you began realizing that Liana didn&#39;t give you a name<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, I uh forgot to do that as well, but how about....Cya?&quot; Liana asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, as long as it&#39;s what you believe is right for me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s settled then, come then, your parents wish to meet your familiar and welcome her formally.&quot; Roed said<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that Zean is still fine with the horses.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, as your parents commanded my lady. Now if you will, I believe that we should be off back to the kingdom soon. Since that you&#39;re going to be recognized as royalty miss Cya, you shall ride in the carriage Lady Liana.&quot; Roed said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, th....thank you, apologies, it&#39;s just that I&#39;m a bit shy right now, because of everything that just happened.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable, most familiars in your position are timid at first, but it&#39;s natural to be afraid in the situation of one. However, I can only imagine what one can go through, and mine was a bit clumsy for about the first month after I summoned him.&quot; Roed said and you breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cya, c&#39;mon let&#39;s go.&quot; Liana called over from the carriage and you walked over towards her with Roed following closely behind you.<br />
<br />
Once you got to the carriage you held out your claw and helped Liana into the carriage politely then got in it immediately after. Moments later you heard the horses neigh and the reigns snap and the carriage began moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is definitely an interesting situation that I&#39;m in right now. I&#39;d be lying if I said that I wasn&#39;t nervous, heh.&quot; You said scratching the back of your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, my father judges familiars personally, so he knows how lots of them act at first. You&#39;ll get some clothes before you meet him like all familiars. Also just relax and try to be formal with him, and I&#39;ll vouch for you if needed.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you, but won&#39;t my wings and tail get in the way?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;The starting clothes for familiars have openings in those areas so you don&#39;t have to worry about that. You&#39;ll probably have a talk with my father about my safety and stuff, he&#39;s kind of protective over me. He was against me coming out here without Roed too, when most would summon their familiars alone.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually if your heir to the throne I can see that easily. So, what do you think he will think of me?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be a bit skeptical at first, especially since we&#39;ll be sharing a room. But as long as you follow your familiar duties and stay by my side he&#39;ll come to appreciate you. He likes familiars, especially since my mother has one, but he was never magically gifted so he can&#39;t summon one.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright that gives me some confidence. Seriously though, I wasn&#39;t expecting any of this, so thanks I guess.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome, I guess, but please refer to me like Roed does whenever we&#39;re in public, or anywhere near the kingdom.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, so is there anything that you would like to talk about in the meantime?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, so how does your new body feel?&quot; Liana asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...the tail and wings definitely feel odd, but I&#39;m getting used to them. These new....feminine features are what&#39;s getting hard to grasp mentally for me though. Between the voice and everything else, it&#39;s kind of hard to comprehend. A part of me wants to be male, but the funny thing is that there&#39;s another part that likes this, a lot actually. I guess it helps that I&#39;m female too in a sense that you mentioned that we would be living in the same room.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that does help, and my father would probably have us in separate quarters otherwise.&quot; Liana said<br />
<br />
Moments later there was a bump and then the ground below the carriage seemed completely smooth. When the carriage hit the bump your breasts jiggled and you held them both together with your claws, and looked at Liana slightly embarrassed. &quot;That usually means that we&#39;re in the kingdom. Don&#39;t worry about the bumps though, once you have a bra things like that will be easy to manage.&quot; Liana said and you smiled and blushed awkwardly.<br />
<br />
The carriage door then opened and Roed was standing outside the carriage. &quot;Lady Liana, I recommend that you redress yourself appropriately for today. As for Cya, you shall follow me so you can get some clothes, and then the King and Queen would wish to see you.&quot; Roed said<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood, until later Cya.&quot; Liana said getting out of the carriage and you followed her and smiled,&quot;Same goes to you Lady Liana.&quot; You said and you saw two guards escort Liana into a passage into a large castle. The castle was enormous and there was towers everywhere, and you were standing in a large garden that was enclosed with large stone walls all around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem,&quot; Roed said and you looked at him and he continued,&quot;Miss Cya, please follow me as I instructed earlier.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, apologies the scenery is just a bit overwhelming at first glance.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable, especially for a familiar. Now right this way please.&quot; Roed said and began walking down a path and you followed him. The two of you walked into a room where there were lots of different clothes and you saw Roed walk over to an anthropomorphic vixen who was wearing leather clothing and a woman in a cloak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Headmaster Roed, has Lady Liana returned without harm.&quot; The woman asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She has indeed Qera, and she has a familiar that I&#39;m guiding to get fitted for standard clothing. Come along and introduce yourself now please.&quot; Roed said and you walked over to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, my name is Cya, sorry I&#39;m still getting used to this.&quot; You said shyly blushing <br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see she&#39;s obviously timid, but from what I see she&#39;s polite. However, young Lady Liana made a small error and accidentally transgendered her, so she requires assistance.&quot; Roed said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of couse, Mora?&quot; The woman who you assumed was Qera said and the anthropomorphic vixen nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Cya, my name is Mora, if you follow me we can get some proper clothes for you.&quot; The anthro vixen, Mora said and you nodded.<br />
<br />
Mora then began walking and Roed and Qera began talking about something else, and you followed Mora to a room that had all sorts of clothes neatly folded and stacked into piles. &quot;Here we are, I know you haven&#39;t been recognized yet, but I would still ask you if I can speak freely for now.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, it&#39;s only me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, so you were male, huh?&quot; Mora asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m still getting used to things, and now that I&#39;ve learned that Lady Liana is the princess it seems that I&#39;ll have to get used to even more.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly do, now let me see here.&quot; Mora said and picked up a strip of leather and measured your waist and hips. More then picked up some undergarments and a dress and instructed you and helped you put them on. There was even a tail hole in the undergarments so that they wouldn&#39;t be uncomfortable. The dress reached down to your feet, but didn&#39;t touch the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it makes you feel any better, I was male before this. That&#39;s one of the reasons that I help familiars like you with this.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;That actually does help comfort me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;You actually turned out exceptionally excellent for a female familiar, so you should be glad.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the encouragement, you seem really nice Mora.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something that I have to be when with newcomers, especially with you. Since you&#39;re Lady Liana&#39;s familiar you have high expectations to meet. But don&#39;t let that worry you, if you don&#39;t know something you will most likely learn it in time.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Learn huh, alright then I guess that won&#39;t be too bad.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, now let me help you with this.&quot; Mora said and she gave you a leather piece that covered your entire front down to your skirt, but left you back bare for your wings. You held the piece over your body and breasts and Mora tied a strand of leather behind you neck. The area on your stomach had holes for lacing too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that too tight at all?&quot; Mora asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re fine do what&#39;s necessary.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, just tell me if anything gets too tight.&quot; Mora said and began lacing a strand of leather through the holes in your top piece and pulled it tight around your stomach and waist behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;That enough?&quot; Mora asked<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good, it&#39;s tight enough.&quot; You said and Mora tied a knot around your waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it for now, or at least until you can get some better clothes to wear. You look kind of nice actually in that, but of course you don&#39;t have any formal wear yet.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mora it feels good to have something covering my body since I was summoned.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my pleasure, and you&#39;ve already got great posture in that so that&#39;s going to benefit you considerably in the future.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Mora, I have a question for you really quick. If you are the one that helps familiars like me get dressed like this then why are you wearing clothes like those?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Mistress Qera originally thought that I was going to be a mage and work with her. But unfortunately I can harness magic at all, so I had an idea and mentioned it to her and she was gracious enough to allow me to change the path that she had for me originally. I&#39;m a huntress for her, ans I&#39;m proficient with a bow so that helps. Of course I have to dress the role for my duty so I wear this all the time in case of attack, adventure, and anything that could involve combat. But your role will probably never change to that of mine.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that makes sense.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Lady Cya, we should get back to Roed so he may guide you with your current task.&quot; Mora said and you nodded, and followed Mora back over to Roed, and Qera was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Headmaster Roed, I have provided Lady Cya with clothing as instructed.&quot; Mora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now return to Qera, she went down the hall into tha library.&quot; Roed said and Mora nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Farewell Lady Cya, may our paths cross again.&quot; Mora said and you nodded and said,&quot;Same to you Mora.&quot; Mora then walked out into the hall and walked off leaving you with Roed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you should probably know that Lady Liana follows a schedule as due to her role. You should know that you should shadow her as her familiar, and you may want to listen in and learn a few things about how you should act.&quot; Roed said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I will be with her unless otherwise told to by her or her parents for obvious reasons.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, so you understand your role well as a familiar. There was a maid that came by earlier and said that she was finished dressing, let&#39;s now keep her waiting.&quot; Roed said and you nodded, and you followed him. Roed lead you out through the garden and into the same passage that Liana went through and the two of you walked through a long hall with rooms for maids and other servants, and you eventually were lead through two large doors into a throne room. You saw the king and queen sitting before you at the opposite end of the room. Liana was with them sitting to her father&#39;s right and the queen to his left. Beside the queen sat a kitsune in a really expensive looking dog bed, and they all watched you enter. What happens now?</p>
