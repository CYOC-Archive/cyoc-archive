<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Is it a fun game? <br />
Yes absolutely. <br />
In fact, I could hardly contain myself. And I was certain the man with impressive testicles next to me was rubbing himself just to hammer that thought home.<br />
Yet I can&#39;t help but feel a little disappointed. I was really hoping for something a bit more dynamic. This was good, but I wish there was a way that it would be even bigger. More difficult. <br />
Maybe give men a performance boost if they hadn&#39;t drained?<br />
Or! Maybe I can have them grow faster while exercising or something? I could just imagine the guys running around the field, their balls swelling as they ran. Having rapid player swaps as the need to drain would become too big. I could feel myself getting hard just thinking about it. <br />
I glanced around and smirked. I had just the thing to try this out. I could just try a few things out and see what caught my fancy. The power of a god was it&#39;s own kind of intoxicating. <br />
<br />
I reached into my pocket. My body froze up, I have never felt this cold. Maybe my other pocket? <br />
My breathing sped up. Nothing. <br />
Okay, calm down. No need to draw attention to yourself, just carefully look around you. Maybe I dropped it. <br />
Nothing. My heart was racing. This was bad.<br />
I got up and hurried from my seat. Racking my brain I hurried passed the sports fields. Did I leave it...the bus! I put it next to me in the bus! I must have left there. <br />
Okay, no reason to panic then. The bus has a lost and found section. I could find it there. I can solve this. Besides, why am I panicking. I love what I did to the world.<br />
Sure, I was a little small, but I loved the feel of my legs rubbing my swollen balls, I love the look of the straining pants everywhere. No reason to panic right? What&#39;s the worst that could happen? I reasoned as I walked towards the exit. Someone else could find and use it. I needed to call them now!<br />
The number for the bus agency was easy enough to find, they did indeed have a lost and found box. The friendly woman on the phone however had no idea if my book had been found. Which frightened me.<br />
<br />
I hurried to the bus stop. It was only a 10 minute wait for the bus I needed, but it was the slowest 10 minutes in my life. Finally the bus pulled up. The bus driver was a pretty hot looking guy. I bet he has a massive penis. Everyone knew bus drivers were the jocks of the working world.<br />
Annoyingly, the seat directly behind the bus driver was taken by two girls talking in hushed tones between themselves.<br />
I launched myself in the seat behind them, feeling a little giddy at being so close to him. I don&#39;t recall ever feeling this giddy ever before. Is this my own pent up sperm heating me up? I wonder if he&#39;s gay. Maybe I should offer to suck him off? It happens regularly after all. It&#39;s the only way to pay proper respects to the noble bus driver. If only I wasn&#39;t such a scrawny geek, then surely he would take notice of me.<br />
But he was busy right now. I&#39;ll try it later. Besides, the girls probably beat me to it.<br />
<br />
Finally we arrived at the bus agency HQ. If I wasn&#39;t in a hurry I would&#39;ve tried talking to the bus driver. You know, ask how he was doing. But I was way too busy for that now. I needed to find my book. Next time though, for sure.<br />
It was a building like any other, grey and dull. However it was surrounded by a massive parking lot, half filled with buses. <br />
While I say it was a building like any other, that was in looks only. Because within that building lay the domain of the bus drivers. The apex of the working world. Supposedly sporting the largest dicks in the world. <br />
My own micro dick made me feel wholly inadequate. Not worthy of even looking at this most holy of sanctums. I averted my eyes. My tiny 2 inch dick throbbing in my pants, was I really going to enter? Was I even worthy of entering? <br />
<br />
Wait, something doesn&#39;t make sense here? How big did I say my dick was? <br />
I took a deep breath and repeated to myself. &quot;My dick is only a puny 2 inches erect, I am part of the lesser men. I am a scrawny weak geek. Only ever able to cum when given permission by a woman or a man with at least a normal dick.&quot; <br />
But, that doesn&#39;t make sense? It doesn&#39;t feel right? I just knew something was wrong, but I couldn&#39;t place it. It was at the tip of my tongue, the edge of my consciousness. Yet it eluded me, if only I had a large dick.<br />
It was infuriating. I could pull out my hair. What was wrong here! <br />
I had the book! <br />
I changed the world! <br />
I made everyone equal! <br />
Everyone had large dicks and large balls! <br />
So why am I small and why is that the most natural thing in the world? Why would I give myself a micro dick? My heart sank. Something was very wrong here. <br />
Maybe the bus drivers would know? Those guys were as smart as they were big.<br />
&quot;Oh my god.&quot; I gasped. That&#39;s it. The bus driver must&#39;ve found the book and he&#39;s using it! <br />
<br />
A great feeling of dread pushed down on me. Why didn&#39;t I realize sooner!<br />
I only realized something had changed because it contradicted what I wanted for myself. What else had he changed without me knowing it? <br />
Were bus drivers always the apex of the world? It felt like they should be, but my mind was telling me that there was no way.<br />
Was I always this scrawny. I looked at my pasty white, thin arms. I have never felt so alien in my own body.<br />
He must&#39;ve found the book and for at least some of the population shrank their dicks. Okay, now that I knew this I could fix it. All I needed to do is find out who the driver was and ask him about my book. Politely. Very politely. <br />
<br />
I stood before the glass doors, an empty receptionist desk was visible behind it. I took a deep breath and went in.</p>
