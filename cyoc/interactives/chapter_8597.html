<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lonnie thought back to his oath of silence less he become a stallion in Prince DeBelle's stable. Yet the book did not show him as a stallion. He shook his head and became angry at the words which denoted his ultimate fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medallion this can not be true! My only dealings with you was the oath of silence which I've kept.  I would be a prime stallion and serve in the fine DeBelle's stables rather than what is shown here. You do me an injustice to suggest such as this, I returned you to Brazil!&quot; touted Lonnie to the glowing Medallion.<br />
<br />
Then is the street below came a loud clatter. Lonnie's attention was turned from the book to see what made the noise. Peering over the window's edge he looked four floors down to the busy side street his apartment was alone.<br />
<br />
There stood a man with his team of draft animals, a large oak salt brine wagon and mixed in was one motorcycle.  The man who rode the cycle no doubt crashed into the team at the intersection below. People were all standing about, laughing and pointing as the wagon master and two men tried to remove the cyclist head from where it had become stuck.<br />
<br />
No doubt a glancing hit the cycle went one way while the rider's head were toss into the air. The one draft horse was dancing about still in her harness but not enjoying the man's head stuck up her horse sized vulva.<br />
<br />
Flaying arms of the man trapped in her big cunt showed his panic as she tightened about his head. Lonnie watched and soon found as so many below it to be of something rather humorous to watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;That poor man, what a humiliating situation! That mare might be thinking his head to be one massive horse cock. See, she twists about as though she enjoys the bulk rammed up her cunt. That poor man, luckier would he be if his whole self was the stallion's cock and his joy in life was to plunge and thrust! Medallion, can you make him enjoy his plight, make him a stallion's cock. Let him feel the delight of what a stallion feels!&quot; asked Lonnie.<br />
<br />
The man was at last yanked out and free. Sitting down on the street's high curb he took out a handkerchief to wipe away the mare's juices. As he sat there Lonnie expected to see him get the stallion stud erection he wanted him to enjoy, but he didn't.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medallion, you failed, nothings happened the man is the same! I wished for him to have what the stallion draft horse would enjoy buried in such a mare. Damn it, he's getting up and going off on his cycle. That mare is very upset she wanted to be fucked by a stallion and lusted for the mating to finish with jets of hot seed, but nothing.&quot; said Lonnie.<br />
<br />
Turning again from the window, angry his desires had not been taken seriously Lonnie began to rave. &quot;Damn it I ordered you to change that man! You are mine and I wished it, I wished it! A big draft horse's cock, a stallion's maleness is what I'm talking about. A black shaft 20 plus inches long, a sheath, the organ of male lust and frantic desires, that's what I wished, that's what I'd wish! Lucky would that big mare feel if such her stud did mount and covering her back pressed his maleness deep into her sex, deep into her tunnel of desire! I wished for her to feel and enjoy such a desire. Oh Medallion just to look at her refined and well formed body. Even as a horse she is striking and her looks made for love. I myself would even now wish to fill her aching void. It would be my pleasure to enjoy the feelings of that lucky man below as he was thrust into her sweet sensual body. Medallion, Medallion, I would wish it to feel and fill her void..........!&quot; said Lonnie as the room went slowly dark.<br />
<br />
Moments later the voices of men talking and an occasional soft whiny filled Lon's ears. Straining to see he felt limp and for some reason quite warm. A trickle of sweat seemed to tickle as it trailed down over Lon's cheek. <br />
<br />
A breeze of cool air chilled the running droplet and gave a slight tingle. Lon's lips felt dry but try as he might his tongue could not lick and moisten them.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his whole body shook and shuddered. Scared from the darkness which surrounded him he wanted to cry for help but there too words came not. Again and again Lon tried to form words. His mind was alert but the lips seemed to be loose and very limp.<br />
<br />
Again his body shuddered and kept on having the shudders for several minute till just as suddenly all shaking stopped. Then it began, a pressure from behind his head. Building in pressure he felt as if something was pushing at his back.<br />
<br />
Lon tried to hold back but he could not feel his hands. The world seemed smooth and like nothing there to grasp or be held. More and more now the pressure was building and with it Lon felt his chest and body bulge. At first uncomfortable in the feeling he began to enjoy the erection of his previously soft muscled body.<br />
<br />
As he felt more bloated the world around him shook and he felt like he was flying in strange circles. Then the feeling of a cold hand over the bridge of his nose. Lon wanted to have it removed but felt powerless to show his anger at the touch.<br />
<br />
Then he felt great warmth, a moistness was touching the area around his mouth and nose. Like tight curtains being draped and run over his face the warmth and moist feeling grew and moved further up his face.<br />
<br />
Now a sick feeling as if he might throw up. The feeling increased as pressure built in his throat. He began to taste the salty brine and as it moved into his mouth he wanted to spit.<br />
<br />
Pressure and choking Lon spit and spit trying to clear his throat and mouth. The vomit tasted salty but was oily as well. Globs of yuck coughed up and were spit out as his lips felt the pressure. His entire face was covered over by the moist warmth and even his shoulders felt the heat.<br />
<br />
Then voices, louder they got and laughter as well. Men were talking about him and he wanted to give them his thoughts. Again Lon tried to speak but his face was still buried in moist heat. Then the words began to clear and his mind felt no more pressures.<br />
<br />
Lon could hear again and this time the words took meaning, made sense, and filled Lon with terrible fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;This stallion has one big cock made to fuck big mares!&quot; said one man's voice. As another agreed Lon felt his head and body slip limply out of the tightness and with a fresh breeze another chill made him shiver.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his face and body was grasp in the hands of some men. Lon tried to struggle as his muscles firmed up and felt ready for the fight. Then warm and wet heat, he was being washed. Lon's mind reeled at these feeling and as a swab was poked in passed his lips he again heard the men talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;See here I show you so in the future you can do this without being told! Here put the swab up past the lips and poke around, yes like that!: said the man and two hands grabbed Lon's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes work the swab inside the lips and find the pearl, Yes that's it! It's not really a pearl like from the sea but instead a small glob of the stallion's semen lodged into a corner of the cock head opening. We remove it less after a number of mountings the pearl grows to block the opening. If this happens the stallion above can't even piss a good stream, let alone mate with a mare. In time left inside it would fester and bring the stallion pain and with more time stop his ability to mate.&quot; said one man to the other.<br />
<br />
Lon felt rather used as the swab spread his lips and twisted his mouth. Then too the salty and oily taste remained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Watch it he's going to release!&quot; yelled the one man.<br />
<br />
Lon's whole body felt the rush of warmth, not outside but from within. His lips bolted open as the flood of liquid roared out his face. Then the acrid taste touched a cord in his mind, &quot;URINE!&quot;</p>
