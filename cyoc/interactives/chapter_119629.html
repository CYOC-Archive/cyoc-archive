<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was happy to discover a recent single by his favorite EDM artist, Martin Garrix.  Jake had fallen in love with the young Dutch DJ&#39;s composing and longed to make music the same way.  He tinkered on his computer daily, trying to make popular mixes on soundcloud and listening to Garrix whenever he needed inspiration.  Though straight, Jake also admired  Martin&#39;s exceptional physique.  He had spent more than one night fantasizing over the young stars bloated instagram, imagining himself the shirtless stud surrounded by attractive fans of the female persuasion on exotic beaches and in countries all over the world.  <br />
<br />
As he sought to slow his racing breath the eager youth examined his prize; &quot;There For You by Martin Garrix and Troye Sivan&quot;.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell is a Troye Sivan?&quot;  He wondered aloud.  Martin was always pairing up with these weird indie artists.  Jake figured it was just him being nice and lifting his fellow musicians up.  He shrugged to himself and flipped the record over to read the fine print.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change will progress with the song, ie 50% through the song you will be 50% the artist.  Changes last up to an hour.  Warning: Listening to the whole song will result in a permanent change into the artist both physically and mentally.  No refunds!&quot; <br />
<br />
Shaking with anticipation along with a little worry that it was a scam Jake inserted the record into the speaker, listening breathlessly as the machine made a series of strange whirling and beeping sounds before the music began.  The familiar style of Martin Garrix kicked in and Jake nodded along eagerly to the sick beats.  He could feel every pulse of the rhythm reverberare through his bones, each echo sending signals to his mind and body.  As each measure washed over him he could feel the slightest drop in height like waking too quickly from a falling dream the ground seemed to rush towards him in brief segments each time giving a rush.  6 foot down to 5&#39;11, then 5&#39;10, and finally Martin&#39;s attractive average of 5&#39;9.  Jake clutched the wall as the shrinking stopped, regaining his balance and pulling at his shirt which fell down too far and his jeans that now bunched at the ankle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit it actually worked.  Shit!  Is that my voice?  This is fucking awesome!&quot;  Jake felt at his smaller throat noticing his higher pitched voice, newly graced with all the colorful tones and the thick dutch accent of his hero.  So engrossed in enjoying his new height and voice, the changing teen barely noticed the first verse starting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I woke up pissed off today...&quot; sang the guest vocalist on the track.  Each word sent another shiver down the young man&#39;s body, a tingling feeling spreading across his skin as it slowly tanned to a healthy, active glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze this is the guy Martin worked with?  He sounds so girlish and whiny, like Justin Bieber.  What a fag...&quot; Jake muttered, unimpressed as the song continued on, the beat picking up and pushing his changes on.  He noticed his accent was thicker now and he felt the artist&#39;s nervous energy beginning to fill him.  He felt cocky, he felt anxious, he felt proud, he felt excited.  He felt pumped!  Jake threw both arms back and spread out his body in a confident pose while his slightly large hands shrank, the fingers contracting and becoming shorter and stubbier, slightly more roundish and the proper size for his new height.  While he watched, his thin and stick like arms began to shorten and compact but swell in girth gaining strong and active muscles as his reach was reduced.  He found himself spreading his legs out more and taking a broader stancr, partially due to his legs also becoming shorter and bulkier and partially his new personality enforcing itself, pushing him to spread himself out and show himself off.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh god yes&quot; he moaned feeling an intense prickling in his chest.  He pawed his shirt off sloppily still unused to his smaller thicker hands.  Normally Jake would be too self-conscious to do so but Martin&#39;s ego was flooding his brain quickly now and he was eager for this part.  He watched closed as a soft black hair slowly pushed its way from right in between his pecs, his first chest hair.  It was closely followed by a 2nd and a 3rd until a neat bush of fine dark hair was dead center on his chest.  At the same time a thin black treasure trail was crawling up from under his pants to his belly button.  Jake had always admired how good Martin looked in all of his shirtless selfies, but his own pale, hairless and muscleless chest was nothing to marvel yet, or it wasn&#39;t before.  Now it was adorned with a sexy patch of fresh chest hair between tight, protruding pecs, packed with lean muscle and an alluring tan with a hard flat stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;When your tears roll down your pillow...&quot;  The chorus kicked in and the beat picked up, filling the room with the addictive electricity of Garrix&#39;s unique sound.  Jake quivered in pleasure as more changes occured across his body<br />
<br />
&quot;Dope!  Woah... did I just say dope?  Dope!&quot;  Jake could feel the strength and energy flowing out of his soft and light new voice.  He could feel Martin&#39;s thoughts guiding him and embraced it.  His thin, plain hair was thickening and gaining the floppy touch of the hot star but in the mist of all his new thoughts, something occured to Jake.  With great difficulty he reached over to the speaker and turned off the music.  It pained him, almost as if the DJ was screaming at him not to stop the music.  Shaking his head, his thoughts slowly clearing, Jake marveled at his appearance: definitely a few years older and while shorter he had a boyish charm and toned muscles with his features a strangely attractive mix of Martin&#39;s and his own.  He nodded approvingly, examining himself in the mirror from every angle.  Jake quickly put his shirt back on with some hesitation at hiding his beautiful new body before walking out and approaching the clerk he spoke to earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo is there anyway I can play this at home with the same effect?&quot;  He asked, noticing his accent and mannerisms still those of the DJ.  The clerk stared curiously, considering the request.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh well yes Martin, er Jake.  You could play it in a record player on your own property, the technology is inherit in the record itself and a series of tones, a combination of gene therapy and hypnotic overtones that reprograms you to be like the artist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dope, my friend loves Martin Garrix too and I want us both to look like this, can&#39;t wait for the girls to see us!&quot;  The clerk paused and pursed his lips as if on the verge of saying something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that seems a fine idea young man, go home and remember, be proud of the sounds you listen to&quot; he advised mysteriously before returning to his duties.  Jake shrugged it off and walked home with a bit of a dance in his step while the changes slowly began to reverse.  By the time he got home, called his friend Ryan and got him over he was himself again with no sign he had ever been otherwise.  Ryan was not unlike Jake, he was rather tall for 18, thin and possessed Jake&#39;s unassuming features but also shared his passion for music and wanting to be a famous EDM artist.  As soon as he arrived Jake eagerly explained the record and its abilities to his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude are you high?  Music can&#39;t transform you.  I know you wanna be famous but someday but I&#39;m really dissappointed you let yourself fall for such a cheap scam, how much did they take you for?&quot;  Ryan sighed, hands on his hips in stubborn disbelief at his friend&#39;s crazy tale.  Turning red, Jake quickly popped the record in and hit play.  The strange tones began once more followed by the first beats of the intro.  &quot;I&#39;m telling you dude its not going to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I woke up pissed off today...&quot; as the song started Ryan stopped in his tracks examining his hands as they went through the same transformation that Jake&#39;s har earlier.  His fingers retracting and widening and his hand becoming wider.  He grasped at his chest as he felt the muscles underneath tingle with energy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Work...&quot; Ryan finished breathlessly, noting his voice had already risen an octave, losing its strangely deep properties and gaining the same smooth Dutch accent and rich tones of Martin<br />
<br />
&quot;And lately everyone feels fake&quot; the song continued as Jake eagerly looked down on his body, feeling again the sensation of falling as his heighy dipped back down to 5&#39;9.  He watched and waited for the muscles and tan and DJ skills to appear.  But something was off.  His height continued to drop another inch and he felt like he was still shrinking.  Looking at his friend in confusion he watched as Ryan removed his shirt and began growing the same firm muscles and sexy patch of chest hair he had previously.  But instead of looking on in just jealously Jake felt himself staring with a new lust.  He was checking his friend out he realized with shock and disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude what the fuck?&quot;  Ryan nodded towards Jake&#39;s ill fitting pants which now had a very obvious tent to them.  Hard as he tried, however he couldn&#39;t look away from his friends cute, round pecs and flat stomach.  He barely noticed his own chest caving in, what muscle he had shrinking away into nothingness and his nipples becoming soft pinkish pinpricks on his bird chest giving him an even paler, boyish physique with an unnaturally smooth surface as if freshly waxed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Smoking cigarettes on balconies&quot; the whiny voice contiued, drilling its way deeper and deeper into Jake&#39;s head as he struggled against the homosexual feelings he was experiencing for his friend.  A flash of images assaulted his mind, vivid memories of smoking, something he had never done before, of small girlish fingers painted to perfection wrapped tightly around the cigarette and breathing in the warm, smooth vapors, calming his fragile nerves before a show.  That deep ecstatic sensation, a pleasure only matched by... no, he had to keep those thoughts down.  He couldn&#39;t be turning into a faggot, why wasn&#39;t he Martin again?<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot;  Jake all but whimpered, quickly noticing a familiar texture to his voice.  The higher pitch, the bizzare but enrapturing accent and the lucid musical tones that teased his ears.  He must be turning into Troye Sivan, the guest singer on the song!  He quickly flipped out his phone and googgled to confirm his worst fears.  There he was.  Born in South Africa, the boy was 22 but looked half that with a short, lithe frame, pale, waxed skin, painted nails and a pouty visage showcasing soft dewy baby eyes.  He wasn&#39;t surprised at all when he saw that this kid was gay, god forbid a musician be gay and not have their entire appearance and life revolve around it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;When your tears roll down your pillow like a river I&#39;ll be there for you&quot; Troye cried out as the chorus landed and Jake felt the catchy beats grab him and pull him further into his new thoughts.  His mind turning to singing, boys and pampering his body.  It was all he could do to resist singing along which he could do now he realized, the memories of vocal coaching pressing into his head and crushing out his own skills and memories.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan, I&#39;m turning into this gay singer!  We need to stop the music!&quot;  But Ryan scarcely seemed to notice his friend still there however, the now distinctly Dutch looking boy was enamored in his firm pecs and emerging arm muscles, he had already begun losing height and developing the stocky athletic build of Martin.  Jake also was having trouble focusing now, his attraction to his friend rising but also hitting its plateau.  Sure his friend was sexy but his mind drifted to cuter, gayer and feminine guys like him.  He subconsciously admired his nails on his finer, skinny fingers.  A sharp contrast from his time as Martin, his digits were now long and thin with jet black nails that were inpecabbly cared for and dainty.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Last year took a toll on me&quot; began the second verse starting a new wave of changes for both boys, they began aging a few years though for Jake he almost seemed to be getting younger, his features becoming ever softer and more feminine while his skin continued to pale.  His friend on the other hand now glowed with a healthy tan, fresh dark hairs thickening across his toned arms and legs which had finished expanding with muscle.  Jake was appalled to discover his own arm and leg hair turn black for a mere moment before dissolving to reflect his twinkish transformation.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be there for you&quot; as the 2nd chorus kicked in both boys felt the change enter their feet and kicked off their shoes.  Ryan&#39;s slim feet shorted drastically, becoming broader, more round and masculine with short stubby toes similar to his fingers and a small amount of hair beginning to grow on the top.  Jake&#39;s did the opposite staying almost the same length but condensing into a slimmer, girlish shape.  With long, thin and manicured toes that were painted a matching black.  Every rough feature and callous smoothed out.  Though a few hairs emerged on his feet aswell they were quickly whisked away to ensure his entire body was smooth and beautiful.  Jake was in shock, his homophobia and insecurity clashing violently with his emerging gay desires and Troye&#39;s offer of pride, confidence and fame.   Ryan, meanwhile, seemed entirely engulfed, now waving his arms and bopping his head as though envisioning himself on stage before the roaring approval of his fans.  His head likely filled with such fantasies as Martin&#39;s priceless composition skills amd self care regiment creeped across his brain and filled him with knowledge and confidence.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m running, running just to keep my hands on you...&quot; the bridge kicked in causing Jake to grasp his head in torment and conflict, his hair pulled upwards as if by a gust of wind before styling itself into neat and cute curls gently layered on top of each other.  His face felt like it was being pulled by powerful hands, stretched into a pointed, mousy layout with his watery, soulful eyes staring at the record player as if pleading it to stop, himself unable to move to do it by now as his mind embraced its change.  Standing next to him now was none other than Martin Garrix, his handsome dutch features clearly displayed from his boyishly charming but square and mature face to his exposed and hairy chest.  Jake tried thinking about DJing, boobs, wet tee shirt contests but it was no use.  All of his old thoughts repelled him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m running, running just to keep my hands on you&quot; each repetition of the bridge was a fresh attack on Jake&#39;s stubborn homophobia.  The words wrapped around his brain like a soft, smoothering blanket, quieting his inmer voice.  More flashes of cute guys, sex, sold out shows, being a pop star and gay icon filled his head.  The beats continued to fill him with pride and courage.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m running, running just to keep my hands on you!&quot;  Jake/Troye bellowed, singing along with his song.  His mind brimming with inspiration and energy, how he gave voice to the conficts of people trying to come out and gay life.  He began waving his hands and breaking into a small dance standing next to his friend while they finished their song.  <br />
<br />
&quot;But you gotta be there for me too&quot; the two sang in unison as the record stopped and two new lives began.  Troye and Martin quickly found proper clothes and began readying themselves for a special performance at the local pride parade.  Both boys now filled with a passion for encouraging lgbt pride despite their differences in sexuality.</p>
