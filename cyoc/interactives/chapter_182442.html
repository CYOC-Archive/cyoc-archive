<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina groaned, every muscle in her body screamed with pain, the burning seeped deep into her muscle, her fur and her soul, her body felt alien, unfamiliar yet somehow the same.<br />
 <br />
Then her eyes shot open, the light of the sun sent beams of light through the large glass window, the light was dancing around the room, Lina let out another groan as she stretched out her front paws, watching as they came into view.<br />
<br />
Lina was shocked by what she saw, Her paws had completely changed, her paws had become large claw like fingers, and her fur had become long and cream coloured along her front legs, her knuckles looked bulky and strong, like her paws were now designed to walk only on the knuckles, a large black V pattern covered her chest and wrapped around her back, her back legs didn&#39;t seem to have changed, the long cream fur seemed to fade into her normal short brown fur, and her tail had become long and covered in long black fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on&quot; Questioned Lina, before she let out an agonising scream, she could feel her cells being smashed together then pulled apart into something new, her new body was fighting with the parts of her old one, both trying to be in controll, her vision whent blurry and she could see the silhouettes of multiple people, their voices sounded distant and had an echo to them.<br />
<br />
Then Lina felt a warm glow in her underbelly, feeling her children move within her swolen womb, they were now her anchor, they were what kept her on the edge of consciousness, she refused to be pulled into that black abyss, her daughters needed her, Viki, Lucy and Sofia needed her. She would hold on for them, then pain once again shot through her veins, her body jolting like it had just been electrocuted, her cells that were once trying to destroy eachother were now fusing into one, one by one. Lina could feel her babies energyes, they seemed to be pulling her fragmented mind and body back together, Lina wanted so badly to rub all over her womb and tell her children just how much she loved them, how thankful she was to them and how much they now meant to her.<br />
<br />
Then the warmth from her womb began to grow, slowly, what was once a small plesent warmth, was now a powerful ball of heat, Linas rubber body began to sweat, which should have been impossible, yet still the heat grew, warmer and warmer, untill it reached the heat of a raging fire, Lina wanted to scream, she was on fire, she needed someone to put her out, and when she could not take it anymore, she opened her eyes and let out a primal scream.<br />
<br />
She saw nothing but white light, her throught burned like she had swallowed fire, the flames scorching her tongue on their way out. &quot;Mama, what are you doing!&quot; Came Ava&#39;s voice, the only voice that seemed clear, however Lina had no idea what she was doing, or how she was doing it, then she was swallowed once again into the black abyss of sleep.<br />
<br />
(Vikis POV)<br />
<br />
Viki was laying in the lounge, smoking up the morning sun, feeling its warmth along the furr of her belly, enjoying the movement of her cubs within &quot;I&#39;m sorry my little ones, mama Lina is sleepy right now, but she&#39;ll be awake soon........I hope&quot; she said as she recalled the events that had just taken place.<br />
<br />
White lights shooting out of Linas eyes and mouth, her new body twitching and jumping around as she, Sofia and Lucy had to hold her down, to protect her and her babies, who could be seen within, each had their tendrals of mist connected to Linas womb walls, obviously they were trying to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please girls, help your mother&quot; she had said to Linas belly, before everything became dead silent, only Linas light breath could be herd throughout the med bay car, three scorch marks could now be seen where the lights from Lina had hit the ceiling, almost burning clear through the trains metal wall, all three black marks were still smoking.<br />
<br />
&quot;What has happened to you Lina&quot; said Sofia as she slipped on her goggles and put on her old lab coat &quot;I&#39;m going to have to ask you two to step out, tell everyone this car is off limits for now, I just need to run some tests&quot; said Sofia as she showed Viki and Lucy out. And this is where Viki has been since then, she had tried to get into the medical car several times now and everytime Sofia had told her to get out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I herd what happened&quot; came a voice, as Viki turned to the doorway to the greenhouse she saw a woman with a bright pink plastic body, her hair was short and black and her breasts were absolutely massive, Viki suspected that they were roughly the same size as Lucy&#39;s, as she gazed to her lower body she saw what looked like a cloud, the girls taur half was covered in white fluffy wool, she resembled a white pompom, just a ball of fluff for her lower body, with black hoofs poking out of the bottom, she was clearly a sheep taur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yah, she&#39;s being looked at by Sofia now, hopefully she&#39;ll wake up soon without the whole.......you know&quot; said Viki in a small voice, the sheep girl trotted over and lay next to her, &quot;I&#39;m sure everything will be fine, if anything you should feel proud of her&quot; said the sheep taur, &quot;hod do you mean?&quot; Questioned Viki with a puzzled look &quot;well she&#39;s the first Hybrid in our history, part ant eater and part grizzly bear, a strange combination don&#39;t you think?&quot; She said with a smile &quot;she&#39;ll pull through...you&#39;ll see&quot; she said as she got up and petted Vikis shoulder.<br />
<br />
Viki, looked down at her unborn cubs, and petted her bellys surface &quot;for all our sakes, I hope your right&quot; she whispered.......<br />
<br />
