<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Admittedly you can&#39;t quite say what you were expecting when you agreed to explore a haunted house, you can safely say that finding yourself stuck head-first in a cursed skinsuit that is turning you into an upside-down minotaur was not a part of the agenda. And yet... Here you are. The changes seem to have come to a halt, at least for the moment, with every piece of your body that had been inserted into the skinsuit having been warped into it&#39;s ventral equivalent. Even your chest, which you have belatedly realized seem to have become your new rear, your pecs having filled out onto a cushy set of cheeks. This pause is little consolation, however. There is not much that you can really do in this current state. Most of your body, or at least the parts that have been fused with the suit, do not indeed seem to respond to any attempts at controlling them, the bovine legs before you still sitting idle in spite of your attempts to get them to do anything at all. Your lower half, meanwhile, is still sticking out of the back end, as you can tell by the chill on the exposed flesh. And yet there is not much that can be accomplished with that either, beyond vainly kicking your legs &#39;til the cows come home. Thankfully, you still have your girlfriend here! Yes, that you are even in this predicament is largely her fault. Still, there has to be something she can do! Maybe she can pull you free, or look around for some sort of way to unstick you, go find help, do anything at all! Even now you can see the the thick, powerful legs of the minotaur body she herself is currently inhabiting shuffling into the top of your field of view. You try to call out for help, but this is not an easy task when your face is a minotaur&#39;s crotch, and your mouth has become it&#39;s vulva. Still, it seems like these sensitive, satiny-furred nethers are the only changed part of your anatomy you have some control over. Mostly this consists of quivering, twitching, and dribbling all over the fur surrounding your changed maw, which is not incredibly conducive to extricating yourself from this situation. Instead it just causes a surge of heat and lust to engulf what was once your face, which feels disturbingly pleasurable. It doesn&#39;t help to that you can still see your girlfriends cock bobbing along just within your peripheral vision. She just stares for a few moments, finally she speaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Hello? You still there? Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
...As much as you love her, you swear that you are going to strangle her if you ever manage to get out of this. Once again you try to communicate, though find moving what are now your labia very awkward, and stop abruptly as a sharp burst of pleasure emanates from your mouth from the motion, making you clench reflexively. She doesn&#39;t even seem to notice. She moves in closer, looking over your ensnared form, deep in thought. She moves in, gently lifting your half-changed body and the rest of the suit off of the hook and placing you on the ground. You are worried that without your input that your body will just topple over, but thankfully it seems to be able to stand on it&#39;s hooves just fine on it&#39;s own. You wait hoping for your girlfriend to come to your rescue. However, she&#39;s not too sure of what she can do herself. She is also herself somewhat distracted, but her own lust roiling within her loins. She was hoping that by now she&#39;d have a cute cow to bend over and fuck silly, but this current dilemma has managed to throw a bit of a wrench into those plans. Maybe she doesn&#39;t have to scrub the idea, though? She can&#39;t see any immediate way to change you back, so... Maybe if she just got you the rest of the way into the suit and hoped for the best everything will all work out! She smiles, perking up noticeably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I got it, don&#39;t you worry about a thing!&quot; <br />
 <br />
You find yourself becoming excited as well, daring to believe that she has managed to find, in some miraculous stroke of genius, a way out of your current plight. She moves up behind you, taking a firm hold of your legs, and you are filled with anticipation, hoping that she is planning to pull you free. Instead this optimism is crushed when she then takes a hold of one of the costume&#39;s arms, pulling it over your leg! The warmth returns, your leg feeling as though it was stuck in a soft, rubbery vice until it caves under the pressure, joint shifting as it starts to fall to your side, becoming longer and more dexterous, feet becoming smaller and toes pulling out into proper fingers. Gripped in sheer terror you try to kick yourself free from gender-bent bovine madwoman you call a girlfriend, but she just effortlessly grabs a hold of it, inserting the wayward limb into the other sleeve as though it were the most normal thing in the world. Now you are well and truly helpless. She pulls the rest of the suit up, covering your lower body and closing the seam in the back. The pressure builds and works it&#39;s way upwards, your skeletal structure shifting, lower back and belly broadening out, becoming sturdier as a new ribcage grows in, and it feels as though your whole insides are being rearranged, making you feel rather queasy. The feeling of tightness grows, and you can feel a rhythmic pounding starting up within your lower body, building in intensity. Your mouth throbs to the tempo, bringing more heat as blood flows through your face. It takes you a moment to realize that what you are feeling is your body&#39;s pulse, a new heart coming to life on the other end of your person. As your own ass fills into the costume&#39;s chest more pressure starts to build under the flesh, starting to expand into plush, sensitive mounds... Right, the breasts. You forgot all about those, especially with the udders attached directly above you. By now your body is mostly complete, leaving only one thing missing. At the moment the only part of you left is your own penis, proudly, if not conspicuously, jutting from the female minotaur body&#39;s neck. Your girlfriend grins excitedly. This would be easy enough to fix... She takes hold of the headpiece, lifting it up and sliding it down over your sex, letting the neck seal to the rest of the body. You can feel your dick throb to life, starting to swell, though this feels so incredibly different from usual. It starts to fill out, thicker, heavier, taking on more density as bone and muscle grows where there was once nothing more than spongy flesh. The urethra widening, forming into a proper mouth, and you can feel the rush of air being pulled into your body as the newly-forming head takes it&#39;s first breaths, your chest starting to rise and fall steadily, the whole experience feeling bizarre and alien. You can then start to feel it move on it&#39;s own, ever so slightly... Shaking a little, as if waking up, eyes starting to open....</p>
