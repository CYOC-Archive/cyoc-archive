<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment the bus stopped I was off and running towards my room. I had about an hour until my room would be back, and I wanted to make sure I was done before he returned. Fortunately there wasn&#39;t anybody in the common area to slow me down, so within minutes I was in my room, locking the door and stripping out of my clothes.<br />
<br />
All my life I had felt that I should have been a girl. It wasn&#39;t that I liked feminine things; it wasn&#39;t that I was necessarily unhappy with my body. It was more like I felt that I would be happier as a female version of myself. So when a magic item which could really change my gender all but fell into my lap, of course I had to jump on it immediately. <br />
<br />
I took a moment to plan out what i wanted to look like. I had no real interest in become some sexual fantasy. While that might be fun to experiment with later, for this initial change I wanted something a bit more realistic. Once I was sure I knew what I was doing, I turned on the light and got to work.<br />
<br />
I started with my feet at the third level of pink. Standing with my feet side by side the beam of light was just wide enough to encircle them. I only meant to expose them for a few seconds, but marveling at the changes made me loose focus. While my feet shrunk overall, my toes lengthened proportionally. I also acquired a slight, pink gloss on my toenails, which was I could only tell came from polish because I literally watched the change. Fortunately, the only side effect of prolong exposure on my feet was that became smoother, and the skin took on a more even creamy color without any blemishes. Once I realized what I was doing, I angled the flashlight and started working it up my legs.<br />
<br />
It was fairly slow going, because I had to wait about a minute for each interval to match the complexion of my feet, but I certainly wasn&#39;t bored during that time. Watching my legs transform from hairy man legs into long, smooth, and toned lady legs was one of the most erotic things that I had ever seen. I had wisely chosen a more moderate setting; I was a afraid the higher intensity might give me ridiculously curvy legs, whereas I wanted more the athletic legs of a female runner. It worked out well, and after a few minutes I was making the light give me the thick, muscular legs of a sexy female athlete. <br />
<br />
Now came the tricky part. I wanted to save my dick for last, kind of a last hurrah of manhood before I fully transformed. But that also meant that I had to be careful about how I changed my hips and waist. I flipped the flashlight up to the seventh setting and covered by junk with my other hand as I brought the light in close. This time I lingered a bit longer as I traced the light around my pelvis. I loved the idea of contrasting athletic legs with a big, jiggling ass, and after a few minutes that&#39;s what I had. Switching the light off for a moment, I took a tentative step forward and was immediately rewarded with an unfamiliar sensation. Just that small movement made my ass shake an bounce like there was an earthquake. It was like having two bowls of jello glued to my hips, and feeling of it shaking made my dick immediately start to harden in my hand. Doing my best to ignore it, I took a few steps around the room, marveling at the feeling off my long, smooth legs sliding against each other, and the sensual movement of my ass. <br />
<br />
With a glance at the clock I realized I only had half an hour until my roommate returned, which meant I would need to stop dilly-dallying. I switched the flashlight back to three and began to work my way up my torso. Within a minute my stomach was slim and toned, and after some maneuvering so was my back. As I worked the light up over my shoulders I realized that the light had also shrunk my torso slightly, to counter the longer legs. Before I had been 6&#39; even, but by the time I reached my neck I thought I was closer to 5&#39;9&quot;, which was still pretty tall for a girl. I skipped over my chest for now, wanting to save that for the end, and instead worked the light down my arms, turning them into a lithe, athletic form ending in small hand with longer fingers and the same clear pink polish which adorned my toes.<br />
<br />
I clicked the flashlight to five and closed my eyes so I could change my face. I wasn&#39;t certain how hot I wanted to look, but I figured it would be more fun to error on the side of too sexy and gave myself a solid two minutes under the light. Then I turned the intensity up one and trained it on the back of my head until I could feel my hair cascading past my shoulders in sexy, red waves. <br />
<br />
It was finally time for the most anticipated part of the transformation. While I appreciated a good butt as much as the next guy, I was first and foremost a breast man. With that in mind I spun the dial up to ten and let my chest have it. Instantaneously, my pecks and limited chest hair disappeared. But instead of leaving my chest flat, instead there was a puffiness behind my nipples, which immediately expanded. It was like watching someone fill up water balloons, except 100 times more erotic. My nipples swelled to the size of toothpaste caps, my areola were the size of half dollars. And my breasts? They just kept growing, extending further from my chest, pushing into each other to give natural cleavage. I wanted to see how big I could get them, but I had enough self control to stop at what I thought was a solid F cup. I hefted one in my hand, and was immediately rewarded with satisfying bounce. As much as I wanted to play with them, there was still one last thing that I had to take care of. And I wanted to try an experiment. <br />
<br />
For the first time since I returned to the room I turned the flashlight to the lowest blue setting. Taking great care to get my aim right, I trained it on my dick. The effect was, odd, but about what I was expecting. Not only did my penis shrink from its average 6&quot; to a measly 3, but it also became softer, smoother. The veins disappeared from the skin as it took on the same creamy tone as the rest of my body. Even the shape changed somewhat, becoming more evenly cylindrical as the head merged slightly with the shaft. All in all it looked just like what I though a huge clitoris might look like.<br />
<br />
There was one last step to my experiment. Switching the flash light back the pink 10, I carefully aimed it at my balls so I didn&#39;t hit my penis. My testicles instantly retreated inside me, no doubt forming new ovaries. The sack folded in on itself as a slit formed down the middle. Soon I was the proud owner of my own pussy. I was just about to turn off the light, not wanting to risk becoming a nymphomaniac, when I heard the handle jiggle on the door.</p>
