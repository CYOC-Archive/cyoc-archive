<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia awoke not on the floor of the storage room but, upstairs tucked into her bed. Her body stiffly protested moving with her joints being the most belligerent. As she positioned herself upright in her bed she first noticed the faint smell of pastries in the air followed immediately by the lack occupied space in her bad. As much as she had tried to rush out from under the covers, her joints still failed to comply swiftly. It was with a deep unsatisfied groan that she noted her condition in the mirror. She currently stood at five feet with some leeway of inches. A stark contrast to her more -natural- towering height and her backside seemed more pronounced beneath the gown. Further inspection showed faint creases around her joints and a gloss to her eyes. Leftovers from Abernathy&#39;s assault against her personally...<br />
<br />
Still she came to wonder which if any staff members might&#39;ve moved her, if indeed any of them would&#39;ve stayed after the event of the night prior... Still she couldn&#39;t dispel the possibility of Marina disobeying her order and returning early. Lisa being that she was made completely obedient would not return without a direct order. Why had she sent them away? Simply because it&#39;d have been a waste to lose the two of them unnecessarily. Marina had complained about being sent away marking the situation with the House Heirs had been troublesome as well. However knowing Abernathy as she had, the witch would&#39;ve made particularly sure to target either of them under the pretense of &quot;apprenticeship&quot; as she had done to Selicia herself...<br />
<br />
Looking through her wardrobe for something to wear proved tasking as she didn&#39;t want to spare any of the power she&#39;d regained frivolously, yet... Most of her outerwear was far too long to wear without training a sizable length of cloth behind her. In light of this she wore a pair of panties gripping tighter than usual and a simple dress shirt as her chest was negligible in her current form... With a stern gaze at the mirror for daring to display her pathetic self, Selicia marched in the hallway and immediately took note of the form standing by.<br />
<br />
That quiet and shy maid was standing next to the door as if she&#39;d been awaiting Selicia&#39;s exit. Seeing Selicia seemed to make her stiffen up and even lower her head although doing so only brought her viewpoint further upon Selicia. Seeing the glare on her face made the maid shrink back and quake softly. With a sigh, Selicia composed herself holding a hand to her face before directly addressing the maid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it you that brought me up here...?&quot; Selicia said having not yet removed her hand from her face. A furtive nod came in response. &quot;You could&#39;ve left and been done with all of this, you know this, don&#39;t you?&quot; A wide eyed stare and another furtive shake of a head followed. &quot;Well then, whatever the reason, thank you for being so diligent in your duties... Your name...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-Thea...&quot; Her gaze was cast further downward as she nervously wrung her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thea... Well, Thea... I need you to contact those of the staff that are left and those that are away to return as soon as possible...&quot; Selicia made to leave down the hall before she stopped. &quot;Two more things... Gather the unfortunates and when you contact Lisa, inform her that the porch is dirty...&quot; Watching for that nod again, Selicia made her way back to the storage room. Along the way she took vague note of shapes on the floor or piles of uniforms here and there.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the storage room, Selicia saw that the staff, her former mistress, was upright and resting in its place on the wall. Opposite of the staff in a corner to the left of the doorway was the large gothic styled mirror that was Abernathy. Colors and mist swirled obscuring any reflection on the surface as silhouettes passed through the mists inside. As she stared at the mirror, the translucent nude form of Abernathy shot forward slamming against the glass between them. She raged and cursed seeming to have regained her right mind separated from the souls that co-inhabited her body. Without notice a pair of beings slipped up from behind Abernathy and dragged her back toward the colors and mist as a third floated forward. Selicia recognized none of the foremost spirits but, the one that addressed her seemed to have an idea of who she was...<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the witch we&#39;d been watching for... It seems we&#39;d been caught in a little spat between the two of you...&quot; The woman crossed her arms seeming to be unconcerned with her state of undress. &quot;Captain Emily Rudge of House Rudge... As it seems there&#39;s no way for us to return to our House, I suppose we will fulfill our duty and detain -A- witch at the very least...&quot; She looked over her shoulder to Abernathy struggling against the pair restraining her. &quot;I trust that you put down the rest of our squad since you&#39;re still here...&quot; Emily&#39;s eyes hardened as she shook her head &quot;Don&#39;t expect us to be friends, witch... We will carry out our duty regardless...&quot; With that, Emily faded into the background carrying Abernathy with the other two.<br />
<br />
Selicia shook her head having not gotten a word in edgewise, she wasn&#39;t particularly in the mood to play as it was... Instead, she let the situation stand for now and inspected the mirror itself. It seemed that something remained of Helena in that staff as this sort of style was of her preferences. The small irony of the full body mirror was that it was comprised of Abernathy&#39;s now gaping vaginal lips with the rest of her remaining body crowning the top like a gargoyle of sorts. The dark gray stone was cool to the touch and yet it thrummed with a inner power beneath her fingers. The temptation was great, with Selicia weakened so and in her current state. She could just draw out enough to solve it all right now... Snatching her hand away, Selicia shook her head, it was well too soon and may always be too soon to try using the chaotic powers within...<br />
<br />
Heaving a sigh of disappointment, Selicia left the room and sealed it behind her. Those were to objects she didn&#39;t want to be easily accessible... She walked back to the front of the house passing doors that were now closed and where uniforms had been. Lisa and Thea were standing by the doors to the consultation room before which laid the all too heavy to move stained glass panes and the permanent ice sculpture of a former maid. Two of the brainwashed squad members from the house ostentatiously preserved to be put on display. Lisa had returned quickly due to her having been hidden mere blocks away, the phrase Selicia had given Thea was her order to return in the event Selicia could not deliver one herself. Passing the two maids and closing the door behind her, she observed the collection of items before her. Setting them aside as either the few intruders or former house staff.<br />
<br />
First and most obvious of the objects was a full size torso with G-cup breasts leaking from the nipples and lips below Selicia rolled it to the other side of the table with some effort given her state. A wet trail now led to that end of the table although the rest of the items were left clean beside it. The next item for inspection was the trio of maids caught during the fight. A string of six anal beads still retaining their original coloration were all that was left of them. Each had been split in two with their face and breasts adorning one bead and the other sporting their vagina and ass. Their eyes still seemed aware of their surroundings while awash with sensation. Setting them aside, the next object in the line was chocolate cupcake with a small stick of peppermint and a pair of chocolate balls atop the whipped cream. This must&#39;ve been the former cook... Considering how long it would take for her power to return to usable levels and that he&#39;d grow stale before then... Selicia did only what was natural for any food... She unwrapped the paper from around the former cook and took a large bite taking one ball with it. If he became stale, he&#39;d be wasted either way so may as well get one last meal from him.<br />
<br />
Chewing on the bite she&#39;d just taken, she set the former cook down and moved to the next item. A manual massager sporting two breast balls and the upper half of the thighs making the other two. The stomach was wedged upward and inward to create a comfortable grip, feeling Abernathy&#39;s touch marked this one as another intruder... Tossing it down to the other intruder, Selicia moved on once again. This item was moving picture of the kitchen maid who laid on her back mewling with legs spread wide as she fingered herself. The sound had been faint enough to be drowned out until Selicia held it in hand. There felt to be more about this one though, she&#39;d fully inspect it later. Selicia sat it aside with the beads and moved to the last item on the table. A garnet colored onahole lay by itself now, picking it up assuming it to be the last of the intruders, Selicia looked it over while take another bite of the former cook. The bite nearly choked her as she&#39;d taken in the face attached to the breasts and oversized sex. She was currently holding what was left of Debbie in her hand. Coughing as she choked down the bite she&#39;d taken she used some of her reserve to see if anything was left of the girl inside.<br />
<br />
There was a long silence before something within the toy stirred. &quot;Wh... Where am I? What happened? Why are you so big?! Or... Small...? Selicia didn&#39;t say anything about a sister...&quot; A very dazed Debbie spoke in her mind as Selicia relaxed a bit. The girl hadn&#39;t been lost to either her new form or Abernathy although Selicia had accidentally followed through with her threat... Clearing her throat Selicia finally made to reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Debbie... Dear... It would seem you got caught in the action and in the heat of battle, well... I feel it&#39;s best you see for yourself, hmm?&quot; Turning in her seat to face the nearby mirror, Selicia was hit with a scream of shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I a sex toy?! What the hell have you done to me?! I did exactly what you wanted! You... You...&quot; Debbie was quickly losing her composure and understandably so...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah, before you finish that thought, Dear... Let me explain... Abernathy was already attacking when you arrived and I reacted quickly to what I thought was another assailant. Unfortunately, that assailant turned out to be you... As for me, I am Selicia, I just have several problems that I can&#39;t fix right now... Which leads me to the next concern... Until I can fix my issues... You&#39;ll have to remain this way for some time...&quot; Awaiting the backlash, Selicia was rewarded with a panicked swarm of questions and concerns. &quot;I know, I know, I will honor our agreement and you will be restored, I just need time...&quot; Selicia took the last bite of the cook and sucked on the peppermint. &quot;I&#39;m just going to take you to my room to keep you safe for now...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Selicia made for her room, she beckoned Lisa to accompany her. She heard Debbie softly moaning during the short trip and found that she&#39;d been absently fingering deep into Debbie&#39;s slit. Sliding her finger out with a pop, Selicia brought the toy up to her face. &quot;Sorry Dear, it&#39;s a force of habit...&quot; Debbie didn&#39;t respond as she reeled mentally from the swift retreat of the finger. Once she&#39;d gotten into her bedroom Selicia looked for a place to put Debbie before her eyes fell on the now too high shelf above. Cringing softly, Selicia walked toward the shelf and turned back to Lisa. &quot;I need a boost, would you Lisa?&quot; As Lisa approached, Selicia turned and lifted her hand holding Debbie upward. &quot;I&#39;m going to set you with the others for now, so you&#39;ll at least have some company...&quot; After informing Debbie of her temporary placement, Selicia set her down to face the other five before being set down again. &quot;I have other matters to attend to now, I&#39;ll have to leave you all to it as it were.&quot; With the door closed, Debbie was left as she thought alone in the room facing the toys of her former peers...<br />
<br />
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br />
<br />
Or so Debbie had thought she was alone... Quietly, as if they&#39;d been asleep the first of them spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So now she has the full set, does she?&quot; The voice seemed almost disembodied but, it felt like it came from the ruby colored toy. Scarlet&#39;s derisive tone was unmistakable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is... Is that Debbie...?&quot; The voice came slowly as if still dreaming but, it belonged to Mollie...<br />
<br />
&quot;She said she hated me... Serves her right...&quot; Sulking as always Freya hadn&#39;t changed mentally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph... Took her long enough, guess you got brought back in after all, didn&#39;t ya?&quot; Rita gruffly added to the conversation among them.<br />
<br />
Debbie waited for a time and as she did the four of them seemed to believe that she was already gone. In fact, she was just waiting for Gabriella to chime in but, the sapphire toy seemed content to remain silently leaking in it&#39;s place. &quot;Y-Yeah... She got me in the raid last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was all the commotion? So the Houses know we&#39;re here?&quot; Scarlet asked curiously more than hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean we&#39;re saved...?&quot; The hopefulness was picked up by the slow speaking Mollie.<br />
<br />
Before they&#39;re hopes could get up any further Debbie brought them back to reality. &quot;N... No... The raid was by another witch... The Houses have given up searching for you all and have begun selecting new heirs...&quot; Her heart sunk a bit handing them the truth so plainly. She didn&#39;t necessarily loathe these women but, they weren&#39;t her friends either...<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re doomed then? I don&#39;t want to disappear as a sex toy...&quot; Freya&#39;s sulking deepened further with the news.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, seeing as we&#39;re screwed then, I&#39;d rather disappear than remain for that bitch&#39;s amusement... You know what happened to Gabriella...&quot; Mentally spitting her words, Rita spoke rudely about the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can only hope that maybe when they finally dispatch her, they&#39;ll change their minds and save us...&quot; The optimism was faint in Scarlet&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Still Gabriella had said nothing even with her name being uttered, Debbie asked the damning question. &quot;What happened to Gabriella...?&quot; She mentally braced herself for Rita&#39;s reprisal which never came.<br />
<br />
&quot;She came under the full assault of the witch... That witch used all of us on her and broke her mind soundly... Every now and again, we hear moan ever more faintly but, she&#39;s gone to us...&quot; The lament was thick in Scarlet&#39;s tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still here...&quot; Again Mollie&#39;s words were slowed as if pulled through a mire.<br />
<br />
It was obvious to the rest and now Debbie, that Mollie would be next to fade away. The poor optimistic girl&#39;s disappearance would likely speed along the rest. The talk ended shortly afterward as they sought to keep from expending too much of themselves. Debbie hoped to herself that Selicia really meant to fix her... Or she&#39;d really just be another part of the set.</p>
