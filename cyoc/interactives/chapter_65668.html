<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Geoff, Lucy, and Mom went into Geoff's room. Geoff's hand shook as they entered in the commands to change the two back. Geoff looked up at Lucy. Did Geoff want to be a man again, yes. But did he want Rick to make love to her again, yes. <br />
<br />
Lucy said, &quot;come on, lets get this over with. We can stay this way if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff replied, &quot;uh, no way. Being a girl is way too complicated.&quot; Geoff's shaking hand waited a second and then said, &quot;I'm getting out of these clothes. Just a sec.&quot; Geoff found one of his robes. Geoff felt self concious of Lucy, a man, watching Geoff undress. Geoff slipped into Lucy's room and returned a minute later, only wearing his robe that hung way oversized on on Geoff's petite frame. Lucy had not changed. Geoff, hands still shaking, gave the breasts one last caress and pressed enter.<br />
<br />
This time, the the hair retracted to its former self. His face felt a bit longer and less rounded. The lips became less full. The breasts shrank to nothing, replaced with a bit of scruffy chest hair. Geoff watched as his hands went from petite to manly and watched as the hair grew from nothing. He could feel his height grow. A slight burning sensation occurred in both sides that traveled down to the vaginal area. Reaching down, Geoff could feel his penis extend out and erect, ready for sex. Then his legs became less hippy and it was over. He was himself again. Lucy was Lucy again. Lucy looked sad and left the room without a word. Geoff thought she was crying.<br />
<br />
Mom said, &quot;I'd better check out Lucy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff sat and thought. The emotions he felt as a woman are still here. Hopefully in time, they become useful memories. Knowing a little bit of what a woman wants in sex could come in handy. Geoff sat and thought about what else the machine could do, then entered in the commands to make everybody but him forget all about the machine. Geoff could hear his mom and Lucy talk, not the exact words, but the tone. They sounded a bit confused. <br />
<br />
Geoff looked at the machine and wondered about it. It did change his mom earlier without another person being present. He could use the machine to change his body. Oh, wow. He could be a great spy. He wondered what it could change himself into. He entered in one command, to change into a? What? He looked out his bedroom window and saw a squirrel. Why not. Change into a squirrel. Then put in a second command to change back. He activated the first command. This time it was painful. He felt to the ground. He could see his arms grow hair. His hands became paws. He felt his body rapidly shrink. His head changed, as did his body. He wanted to scream, but all that came out was chirping sounds. Then it was done. It was hard but he eventually pulled himself out the robe he had been wearing. He slowly crawled, as he wasn't used to be on 4 paws to his mirror and sat up. A squirrel looked at him. &quot;Cool&quot; Geoff thought. He crawled back to the chair and found it was very tall. He made an effort to jump up, but failed. Then the door opened. <br />
<br />
Geoff realized he didn't lock the door. Geoff turned and his mom was in shock. He realized all she saw was a squirrel. Geoff tried to jump up to the chair and the computer to press the enter key and turn back. But his mom was quick. About the time Geoff got up on the chair, all he could see was white. His mom had put him in a pillow case. <br />
<br />
He could hear his mom say, &quot;Lucy, quick, open the door. We had a squirrel in the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff cried out, &quot;Mom, don't, it's me Geoff.&quot; All that came out was a bit of chirps. Geoff just swayed as his mom rushed down the steps. Then he felt no weight and then a thump as he hit the ground. A door closed. Geoff got to his feet, his four feet, and eventually crawled out of the pillow case. He was outside. the door was closed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Geoff thought. He spent a few seconds getting used to this animal's body and made it to the door. He scratched and scratched at the door. After a while, he sat on his rear and realized. &quot;I'm a squirrel and I'm stuck outside.&quot;</p>
