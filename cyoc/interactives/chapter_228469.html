<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How do you like it, Vixey? Do you want to be with a hot boy, for a dance!?” Asked Suzy as Jeff was overwhelmed again by girly thoughts, picturing himself dancing with a cute boy, and felt happy with it. The boy spirit became almost muted as the girly mind took over one more time, only stronger this time around. This made his grew a little louder as the questions of girls were left unsaid. “I bet you do… now that you are all cute, you definitely need a nice boyfriend!”<br />
<br />
Still in her sister&#39;s room, she brought him in a corner of her room where her mirror was located at as Jeff was growing impatient. “I am like, so happy right now.” he thought. “This outfit is so pretty. I can’t wait to meet my date!” Suzy unclipped her new pet from the leash that was on the collar. Still There that Vixey made a few poses like a cute blow kiss while crouching down, trying on different clothes to see which would fit in good times, or taking care of the hair. “Stay here, while I&#39;ll get your date ready. &#39;Get used to it Jeff, cause this will be your new room for a while.” Said Suzy as she went away from the room, locking her rubber pet inside and moving somewhere else at the time as she was headind towards the chronivac.<br />
<br />
His girl-mind still taking the lead, due to the recent talking, he wandered in the room, unable to get out since the door in theroom was locked that this was also included to the windows. He passed in front of the mirror as his retraction was so stylish, even if he looked dang goog in almost any different outfits he was in as this was somewhat himself. He admired each outfits as he then sat and took a moment to talk at the mirror with himself, pretending to gossip with his reflection about his date to come. Even as a pet rubber fox girl, He could hear Suzy moving in the other room for He started to wonder to what his sister was planning for him.<br />
<br />
As the times gone by and passed, Jeff began to recovered some of his spirit. It was Like he was slowly waking up, from the dream and the real aren’t totally distinguishable, he looked around. He was a rubber pet fox girl… or was he? He was Suzy big brother, not her pet girl. He looked in a mirror some more and saw the most beautiful rubberized fox girl of his dreams, But this was definitely him. “This outfit fits me like, so well.” told a girly voice in his head. “My date will surely love it.” The date her sister was getting ready for that it suddenly hit him for he was also his sister’s pet right now, and she intended to treat him as such. He needed to get back to the Chronivac and return to his normal body. He jumped off the bed and began to rush out of there, going to the nearest window to see if he could escape as He tried to fight the girly voice that seemed so happy in this room. Looking out for he couldn&#39;t make The jump as it was a two stories drop from the window too the grownd. even if he did, he would be stuck as some perv who&#39;s into a roleplay pet of a fox girl in a rubber suit that someone willread the tags on his collar and return him back home. He looked around the room as he knew that he was trapped, for now while seeing no way out of escaping.<br />
<br />
“Ok, ok! This is a nightmare! I just have to get out of the house and, and maybe... I&#39;ll be stuck like this for the next three months that my little sister could even make this to a permanent thing! I&#39;ll be stuck like this, forever! &#39;Sigh&#39; what will I do? If I leave, I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll ever get back to normal. But maybe, &#39;sigh&#39; maybe I&#39;ll come up with a plan!” Jeff said to himself, worrying as to what to do.<br />
<br />
He just then heard stomping as his sister was coming back with a huge smile, but who was the second set of stomping? He was going to find soon enough as the door was unlocked that the door was shortly open. “it’s all set !” she said, walking up to Jeff. “You’re ready for your first date with an awesome man, Vixey?” She wrapped her arm behind him as she pointed towards the doorframe, where Jeff saw the most hansomest rubber fox man he laied eyes on that Jeff felt girly thoughts come back and take over. &quot;Like, I&#39;m going on a date, with him next week?!&quot; Vixey said as Jeff started thinking about boys again, and how he was so happy to meet one of his kin. Suzy grinned : “hmm deal. So, his name is Taro. You’ll have your second date next week, but for right now though… you need a chance and get to meet him!”.<br />
<br />
As she took him where she had prepared everything, she looked at her pet rubber fox girl of a brother. “hmm, I&#39;ll give my pet rubber fox girl here a background… you&#39;ll need those if you are about to meet your future husband !” She stopped a second to think as she shortly said, “While you are my pet, you&#39;re… a cheerleader as you preform to help raise spirit for your school game team, secretly seeking for true love also.” Jeff was so happy right now for he not only had a name by the name Vixey, but had also accepted without question what Suzy had said about him being as that he wanted to meet his one true love.<br />
<br />
His sister posed him in front of her, facing a beautiful well dressed anthro rubber pet fox girl while lecturing him by yanking his pet collar to reach his ear. “now then, this here is your girlfriend&#39;s house. To thish, you should never come here, unless to you want meet your cute love as she&#39;s your girlfriend youonly have eyes for. You understand?” Suzy told him. As she let go that with a slight nod, She backed up to the door and let a anthro rubber pet fox boy, Taro, get a good look at his future wife while Jeff was looking at his future husband of the house. He was wearing a white T-shirt with a leather jacket, black jeans, bicker black gloves, and black tennis shoes. “He&#39;s like, so looks handsome. I think that I&#39;m in love.” thought Jeff as he was looking at his date&#39;s perfect volpen face with his dark brown long hair that&#39;s in a ponie style with blue & yellow streaks of hairs (almost like gekkan mousou kagaku&#39;s anthro feral tiger&#39;s hair.), yellow eyes,and a gorgeous smile. “Vixey, meet Taro, your new boyfriend.” giggled Suzy. With out realizing what happened next, Jeff jumped onto him as he wrapped his legs around his waist, arms around his neck while kissing him with muzzle to muzzle that Taro had his arms around Jeff&#39;s waist, and hands on his ass to help hold his support wight.</p>
