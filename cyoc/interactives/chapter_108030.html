<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After making a morning inspection and sorting out a few issues Jane retreated to her office to manage a mountain of paperwork and go through a dozen reports. Things were fortunately quiet during this time as her staff knew that the Boss was not a morning person and that she was much better to deal with after a few hours. Only one person came in, a Junior employee named Alice Wong to drop off a report. Jane did not pay her much attention but did note that for some reason she had decided to put pink highlights in her hair and she though she saw an odd bulge in the back of her skirt. At 11:00 their was a meeting about some remarkably banal parts of procedure. When she got their she noticed that the workplace had become a more colorful place in it&#39;s dress. Shirts and jackets she&#39;d sworn were much more colorful and ornate. Hair was also different. All the guys she&#39;d seen had apparently grown their hair out and many people, both male and female looked like they had some highlights. A few people were sitting a bit oddly as well and some odd bruises. She also noticed that she was looking down at people more than she was used to. Finally she saw more splotches of color on skin, but people tended to be cautious about it. Some were effected far more than others.<br />
<br />
When she got to the meeting she&#39;d went through the points and as she did so she took in a few changes. Apparently the rest of the staff saw it as well, but others were self conscious about it and were quite deliberately not talking about it.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly it hit Larry full force. He suddenly began to shrink in size considerably, his huge girth sucking into his body at high speed as his features became smaller and more delicate. In total he went from 172 centimeters to 125 centimeters. His hair poofed out and changed color going from black to blue green locks which flowed down his back before braiding itself into a pony tail. His sensible business shirt puffed out and grew into a knee length dress which gave the impression of being made out of leaves with a vine being used as a belt and a pair of giant white and pink flower petals becoming something to the effect of a slip skirt. Jane watched in horror as his, no, her pants fell apart. The legs fell off leaving and disinergrated. She staggered about for a few seconds as she got her balance and took the radical changes which left Larry looking like his twelve year old daughter when the most radical changes began.<br />
<br />
Larry had had a few light green splotches on his skin beforehand. Now they rapidly expanded across his body, mostly going from her torso outwards, mostly turning it green but leaving her front a pale white. Her fingers became red and developed sticky pads at their ends, as did her toes as they lengthened into a second set of hands. From her back grew a long sender tail with a red tip while her face extended and distorted itself into a short muzzle and her eyes turned a deep red with a slit pupal. In short she looked like one of those Lizard Girls in that show that Steve liked so much. As the change finalize, the apperence of shock and horror gave way to a sort of giddy enthusiasm and a girlish snickering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Larry! What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lizard girl looked at her and gave her a grin full sharp teeth. &quot;Oh nothing Jane, I just found of what was always meant to be!&quot; She said as she jumped onto the table disrupting paperwork and coffee. &quot;Also the name&#39;s Lily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll Lily,&quot; She said looking for some refuge and finding it in normalcy &quot;it&#39;s important we know the new procedures for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is far to drab.&quot; She said &quot;Dull work, dull chairs, dull tables, dull people. Let&#39;s fix that!&quot; The last words she said as she looked at Alice, stuck out a long tongue once and jumped on her. &quot;I&#39;m not letting go until you&#39;ve loosened up!&quot; She cheered as amy changed herself. Her hair became completely pink and she began to shrink. As soon as Lily had grabbed her so the short tail that she&#39;d been going out of her way to conceal shot out from behind her back as she shank down and her breasts were absorbed into her body. Her dress, previously about 20% through it&#39;s transformation became a brown and white steampunk dress with a surplus of pockets along with with a lab coat, Marry Jane shoes, rubber gloves while a set of goggles on her head. Soon she was a lizard girl just like Lily with big eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Cogsberger! Oh well. At least you&#39;re better than you were before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes!&quot; Alice said as she eyed the water cooler and coffee maker and got out a number of tools. &quot;So much to do, so little time!&quot; She then began taking it apart methotically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Jane.&quot; Lily said as she eyed her. &quot;I feel great about this whole thing! Soon you&#39;ll too.&quot; She said as she picked up a smartphone and used it as impromptu mirror. It revealed that Jane&#39;s pantsuit had begun to develop some color and that she had some splotches on her skin.</p>
