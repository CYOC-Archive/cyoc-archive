<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unaware that the clothes that the two gym teachers kept, items like shirts shorts and swimwear, had also become enchanted when the items in the lost in found magically protected against theft, Neil continued to stared out into the empty locker room. Her mind racing she thought she heard a bell ring from somewhere far off and thinking that it must be a hiccup in the school system choose to ignore it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's what I've always wanted,&quot; Neil thought to herself as she glanced down at his female body. After a couple seconds, she looked up and into the mirror, taking in her five-foot-three height and seventeen year-old appearance.<br />
<br />
Secretly, this was something she had always wanted, but had been to shy and introverted to tell anyone. Now that she was a girl, she wondered how it had happened. Knowing right away that it hadn't been the fact that she'd changed in the girl's locker room, as she done this loads of times in the past, Neil right away dismissed the notion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps its the clothes?&quot; she thought as he looked down at the garments, wondering how such a thing might have had happened.<br />
<br />
Somewhere, she thought she suddenly heard voices and stepping away from the mirror, Neil headed out area of the locker room that had the toilets and showers and into the section with the lockers, office and door into the pool. Stopping, looking about, she listened.<br />
<br />
Not hearing a single thing, she began to walk through the main room, trying to sort out her thoughts, thinking that her appearance was still close to her original male self, but now more feminine.<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s as if I've been turned into a female version of myself,&quot; Neil reasoned as she attempted to think as to why she hadn't turned into the person who'd last worn the clothes he'd nicked. Than she came to the conclusion that it might have been because she’d took various garments. <br />
<br />
“And because there were a multiple number of options, the magick that had been involved, if there was any, had simply based the change on what I’d would look like as a girl that fit the clothes that I’d had nicked,” she reasoned.<br />
<br />
Feeling that this made the most sense, she stopped as she realised something and thought, &quot;But my male genitals didn't change,&quot; and running a hand down the front of the skirt she was now thinking of as her skirt, she pondered over what it would take to alter his private parts. Suddenly stopping, feeling and thinking something about her privates felt off, Neil turned and headed back to the part of the locker room with the mirror.<br />
<br />
As she stepped back in front of the reflective surface, Neil took a deep breath and prepared herself for what she was sure she would see. As she did this, she wondered what her female was and automatically told herself, “Nellie,” as she reached down and once again ran a hand over the front of her skirt.<br />
<br />
Grasping the hem of her skirt Nellie pulled up and starred at the flat surface of her bikini. After a bit she muttered, “It’s supposed to be flat,” and still holding her skirt with one hand, she grasped the section of her bikini that ran between her legs.<br />
<br />
As she pulled to her right, Nellie stared at the flat skin and just the hint of her feminine split. After a moment, torn between remembering that that she had a penis and testicles and that there was no way she had such things, Nellie let out a nervous giggle. Releasing the bikini and her skirt, she reached up into the garment and pulled on the strings sitting high up on her thigh.<br />
<br />
“It must be the clothes,” Nellie reasoned as she pulled the bottom half of her bikini away, exposing her genitals.<br />
<br />
Liking how the soft denim felt against her mons pubis, glad she’d shaved until she only had a thin strip of hair and knowing that she had her last cycle a couple days ago, she stuffed the garment into her pocket with the top piece. Adjusting her skirt, she thought, “If I was indeed a boy who wanted a girl and I indeed got what I wanted and it was the clothes that did it, than one must ask themselves how and why.”<br />
<br />
Unable to come up with an answer, Nellie decided it was time to get going and heading back to the lockers. Pausing for a moment before the one she had stored her male clothes in, she idly twisted the combination. As she did this, she asked herself, “Why would you want to collect to garments anyway?”<br />
<br />
Figuring it was because she wanted to dump them in the lost and found and say goodbye to her male life, Nellie twisted the combination to the correct three lockers and pulled open the door.<br />
<br />
To her surprise what she found inside was not the clothes she had worn when she had been Neil, but a backpack. Pulling it out, she once again thought she heard voices somewhere outside the locker room and somewhere in the distance a bell ring. Slamming the locker, she hefts the backpack for a couple seconds before finally taking it over to a nearby bench.<br />
<br />
Forgetting what it was that she had wanted to retrieve from the locker, Nellie opened the pack and sorting through the contents, she realised that everything inside was hers.<br />
<br />
“Any why not?” she asked herself.<br />
<br />
“I packed it this morning with what I needed for the day,” she reasoned as she zipped the backpack up and than slung it onto her back.<br />
<br />
Adjusting it so that it sat comfortably, Nellie looked about the locker room and slowly forgetting about Neil and his strange need to dress in the girl’s toilet, she headed for the door.<br />
<br />
As she pulled on the door, not even giving a second thought to the fact that it was now unlocked, Nellie wondered if it was possible for clothes to change a person into somebody or something else. Stepping out into the hallway, which was now filled with students heading home, she began to scan the crowd.<br />
<br />
Spying her best friend, she raised a hand to flag the other girl down. As her friend returned the gesture and started over, Nellie thought one final time, “If it were possible for a person to change themselves just by wearing a different set of clothes, it would make the world a confusing place.” and than her friend reached her and was asking how gym went.<br />
<br />
“Meh,” Nellie replied as she shrugged and putting thoughts about people changing who they were by changing clothes out of her head, she began to walk to the buses with her friend.</p>
