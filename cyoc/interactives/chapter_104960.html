<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack left Eric’s room with burning cheeks, waddling quickly back to his room. He then took another nap until his mother knocked on the door and woke him up for dinner. Honestly, he had no idea why he was feeling so tired. Jack had taken two naps that afternoon. It must be because he was so old now.<br />
He slowly walked down the stairs to the dining room. It was so much harder to walk down the stairs when his fat belly blocking his view of his feet. Jack had always taken his slim frame for granted, and now that he was a man with a big round belly, he sorely missed it. His considerable thighs were also brushing against each other as he descended, slowing him down even more.<br />
Jack could also feel all the fat on his body wobbling with each step he took. This made him realise even more how obese he truly was. Finally, he entered the dining table and sat down. Jack’s fat butt was too big for his chair and thus, hung off the sides of it. Surprisingly, his mother and father didn’t even flinch when he entered the room. Surely his parents would notice that their teenage son had turned into a fat, hairy, balding middle aged man! Somehow, reality had been altered when he had changed so that everyone would think that he had always been that way. With a shock, it dawned on Jack that he had never gotten properly dressed for dinner. He was still wearing that stinky jockstrap and nothing else. He groped his cock and felt that his manhood had somehow gotten bigger as well, it was bulging out of the jockstrap along with his pubic bush. Jack looked down and saw that his cum was still in his hairy man breasts and belly. He had forgotten to take a shower to clean it off. He was also sweating again and judging from the BO he was emitting, he had also been sweating as he slept. Jack knew he was destined to be a very sweaty man. Luckily, his parents took no notice of his BO. It was as if they had smelt it so much that they had gotten used to it.<br />
Just then, Eric bounded into the room, shirtless. Jack saw Eric’s belly wobbling too as he made his way to the table. Once Eric had gotten seated, they all started eating. Jack was surprised that his mother allowed him to have second helpings as before, she almost never allowed anyone to have them, saying that overeating was unhealthy. Jack was even more surprised when she offered him third and later on, fourth helpings which he gobbled up.<br />
Much later after dinner, everyone except Jack had retired to their rooms. He was watching TV downstairs while eating two family size bags of potato chips. Then, the doorbell rang. He waddled to the door to see who it was. It was Devon. Devon swaggered into the house. <br />
“Wassup, bro. There’s some shit we have to talk about,” drawled Devon. “Firstly, there’s no use in telling anyone that we changed you into a middle aged man because as far as they’re concerned, that’s what you’ve always been. Second of all, when reality was altered, you became our new physics teacher. So, tomorrow morning, you better come to school and teach. Oh, and by the way, you’re also going to help us get more jocks, or else.’<br />
After saying that, Devon playfully squeezed Jack’s manly breasts and left without giving Jack time to respond. <br />
Jack was in shock. Him? A teacher? But Jack knew he had no choice, if he didn’t, then Devon and the others would surely punish him. With that, Jack finished his snack and went to bed.<br />
The next morning, Jack woke up bright and early. He took a shower to finally get rid of all the cum and sweat on his body. Then, feeling clean and fresh, he waddled over to his wardrobe to get dressed for his first day as a teacher. Opening his wardrobe, Jack got a shock. All his clothes had changed, his former clothes had now become tank tops, shorts, undershirts, shirts and pants. He then proceeded to wear his jockstrap from last night because apparently, that was the only piece of undergarment he owned. <br />
Following that, he put on an undershirt. It was pretty snug and it only just covered his hairy, mammoth belly. Then, he wore his shirt. He had some difficulty doing the buttons. But the real struggle was getting his pants on. It was pretty small and jack wasn’t sure if it would fit his large waistline. But eventually, after much struggling, they were on.<br />
Jack inspected himself in the mirror. During his struggle with his pants, his undershirt had ridden up and now thick brown body hair on his belly was visible through the gaps in his shirt. Jack had also started to sweat. The shirt material at his armpits was now damp from the sweat and had become almost transparent. This allowed his impressive thatches of pit hair to become visible from great distances.<br />
Jack glanced at the clock and saw that he had to leave now in order to get to school on time, especially now that he could only waddle slowly. Jack quickly lumbered down the stairs and out of his house.</p>
