<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>First and foremost, me and mine about as well as can be expected, given all the {censored} we&#39;ve had to endure since my last post here. Hope everyone else is doing okay.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With nothing left to do since having authorized the doctor to perform the emergency operation that might save her husband&#39;s life, Elizabeth Harper and her eldest son James Harper Junior staked out seats in the waiting room and settled in for the long haul.<br />
Given the time difference between coasts, it was approaching 10 in Alabama. Elizabeth had considered calling her eldest daughter in Moon Lake to let her know what was going on, but James had talked her out of it.<br />
&quot;Until we know something definitive...&quot; he began, but was interrupted when a man walked into the waiting room.<br />
James didn&#39;t recognize him, but his mother tensed up immediately upon seeing him.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to intrude,&quot; he began, taking a seat near but not directly next to them. &quot;I&#39;m Gregory Hancock, Shepherd of the Glorious Light Church. We missed you at Sunday Service Sister Elizabeth, and it&#39;s been a mighty long time since you have been in attendance Brother James.&quot;<br />
James Junior just stared at the man as his mother said, &quot;We had family business to attend to out of state.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, that matter about your oldest daughter getting married without family or church permission,&quot; Hancock said calmly, which irked James because as far as he was concerned, it was none of the man&#39;s business. &quot;How is she, by the way?&quot;<br />
&quot;Happy,&quot; was all James would say.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Hancock said in disbelief. &quot;And what of your other children Sister Elizabeth. Brother John and Sister Janice?&quot;<br />
&quot;Considering the hour, being looked after elsewhere,&quot; James said before his mother could speak, since he felt it was none of the man&#39;s business, especially considering the nature of Moon Lake.<br />
&quot;Odd, since I&#39;ve been told that neither the young ones nor Sister Jennifer returned with you from Washington State,&quot; Hancock said, eyeing the Harpers closely.<br />
James was developing a growing mistrust and hatred of the man with every passing second. &quot;I hate to sound rude, but what are you doing here at this late hour?&quot;<br />
&quot;I heard that the Senior Brother James was ill and came by to see if there was anything I could do to help,&quot; Hancock replied with a smile.<br />
<i>Like a shark circling his prey,</i> was James Junior&#39;s observation.<br />
&quot;We appreciate that,&quot; Elizabeth said, deciding she needed to say something, &quot;but as you know it&#39;s out of our hands now. Just a question of waiting to see what happens.&quot;<br />
&quot;And praying,&quot; Hancock added.<br />
&quot;I thought that was a given,&quot; Elizabeth said.<br />
&quot;Of course. Shall I lead us in—&quot; Hancock began to offer, but Mrs. Harper turned him down.<br />
&quot;As much as I appreciate the gesture, it&#39;s late for all of us. I&#39;m sure Mrs. Hancock is waiting for you at home and it&#39;s been so stressful for me that I&#39;m likely to fall asleep at any moment, which is why Junior is here for moral support and to keep me company,&quot; Elizabeth explained.<br />
&quot;Of course. Family is important,&quot; Hancock said as he slowly rose from the chair. &quot;If you need anything...&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got your number in my cell phone,&quot; Mrs. Harper said, briefly holding up her purse.<br />
&quot;Well then, like you said, I&#39;d best be heading home but my family and I will be praying for you and your husband, as well as the rest of the Harpers. Take care Sister Elizabeth,&quot; Hancock said, walking to the door.<br />
&quot;And you as well Shepherd Gregory,&quot; she said in return as he left the waiting room.<br />
<br />
James was about to say something when his mother whispered, &quot;Make sure he&#39;s gone.&quot;<br />
With that her eldest son got up and walked over to the door, acting like he was just stretching his legs. When he opened the waiting room door, the outer corridor was clear.<br />
&quot;All gone,&quot; James said, walking back to sit down beside her again.<br />
&quot;Lord help me, I really hate that man,&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;So nosy and—&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t like him mentioning the others. He can&#39;t cause them any trouble, can he?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see how off the top of my head. Hancock can be quite the busy body, and that&#39;s putting it mildly. But as far as I know, your father didn&#39;t make any arrangements with the church concerning either me or you kids.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. The less he knows, the better,&quot; said James. <i>Especially about Moon Lake...</i><br />
<br />
And speaking of that locale several time zones away...<br />
&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; Joanne Howard announced as she drove her car toward the airport DROP OFF point.<br />
&quot;I hate leaving you in a lurch,&quot; her future daughter Karen Yuletide said from the back seat.<br />
&quot;You know what your mom would say about missing school if she was here, despite how important it was for you to be here for her,&quot; Joanne said, thinking about the woman she loved still being bed ridden in ICU.<br />
&quot;I have left every potential emergency contact number on a piece of paper back at your apartment,&quot; Karen&#39;s fiancé Peter Talbot said. &quot;Should the need arise—&quot;<br />
&quot;Even if you just need someone to talk to,&quot; Karen added.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all very much appreciated,&quot; Joanne said, trying to keep from crying while driving. &quot;Okay. Approaching the door now. You two have everything?&quot; she asked, while turning on her car&#39;s four way flashers and angling toward the curb near the PASSENGER DROP OFF area.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Karen said as the car came to a stop. Peter got out first with their carryon bags in hand since he was the closest to the door as she added, &quot;We&#39;ll be back for Thanksgiving weekend as originally scheduled and don&#39;t worry,&quot; before leaning over the back of the driver&#39;s seat long enough to give Joanne a peck on the cheek. &quot;You and mom make a great couple and we&#39;ll all get through this in time.&quot;<br />
Joanne couldn&#39;t help blushing at that statement before saying, &quot;Okay. You take care and have a good trip back.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll text you when we&#39;re home,&quot; Karen promised, closing the back door behind her after stepping out of the car.<br />
Together, she and Peter stood on the sidewalk and watched Joanne drive away.<br />
When she turned to look at him, Karen couldn&#39;t resist asking, &quot;Why are you smiling?&quot;<br />
&quot;You told Joanne &#39;When we&#39;re home&#39;,&quot; observed Peter.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Karen said, before giving him a quick kiss on the lips. &quot;We have a lot to talk about in regards to all of our futures, but don&#39;t be surprised if I fall asleep on the flight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then you will probably meet me in dreamland,&quot; Peter announced before yawning. &quot;But first let us check in and board. I still need to text my father our estimated arrival time so he can have someone meet us at the Seattle airport and drive us back to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good, and Mister Talbot...&quot; began Karen.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Peter wondered.<br />
She leaned as close to his ear as she could given their height difference and whispered, &quot;While the exact date might get delayed, I&#39;m still looking forward to the day I&#39;m your wife, fur and all,&quot; Karen said before kissing him on the cheek.<br />
Now it was Peter&#39;s turn to blush as they walked into the airport holding hands as the other held their respective carryon bags.<br />
<br />
