<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bernard was always an early riser and the next morning was no exception. He woke in a good mood. He had signed a new deal and he had enjoyed a fuck with Angela last night. Perhaps things were finally starting to go his way?<br />
<br />
He rolled over to face Angela and enjoyed watching her breasts moving up and down as she slept. Angela was well endowed and although a mother of three, she had kept her figure. Angela was about to turn 41, but she could easily pass for a woman in her mid thirties. Indeed, despite years of breastfeeding Bernard considered she had nicer breasts than the call girl who had accompanied Simon last night. He truly loved this woman.<br />
<br />
Unable to control his desire Bernard reached across and cupped the breast that was mesmerising him. He was hopeful Angela might be up for a quickie. <br />
<br />
But she wasn&#39;t. She let out a quick &quot;No! Leave me alone!&quot; then rolled away from him, clearly not in the mood. On reflection Bernard wasn&#39;t that surprised. Angela had really got stuck into the alcohol last night and would no doubt be nursing one hell of a hangover. He decided to let her be.<br />
<br />
Given that Angela would be indisposed all morning it was probably up to him to get the kids up and out to their morning swim class. Bernard was thankful that he seemed to have a pretty good metabolism and never suffered hangovers. He rolled out of bed and set to his morning routine.<br />
.......<br />
The real Angela was initially disorientated, when shaken her awake. She found herself in Jessie&#39;s bedroom dressed in Jessie&#39;s clothes. It took a few moments to recall the events of the previous evening. &quot;Wake up Jessie. Time to get ready for swimming squad. I&#39;ll be taking you this morning. Your mother over indulged last night and is indisposed&quot; Bernard moved off, no doubt to wake Aaron in the same manor.<br />
<br />
Angela momentarily considered feigning sickness herself then thought better of it. Why not go to swimming squad? It would be fun to be a teenager doing physical exercise. She should make the most of having a young lithe body while she had the opportunity. She actually found herself bouncing out of bed herself, something she rarely did in her own body. Bernard might have been a morning person but Angela certainly wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
15 minutes later she was in Jessie&#39;s swimsuit ready to go to squad training. She briefly visited her own bedroom in the hope of a word with Jessie but the poor girl just groaned and rolled over. Jessie looked terrible and had clearly forgotten to remove her makeup before going to bed. Angela felt sorry for the girl, but it would hopefully teach her about the perils of alcohol.<br />
<br />
Squad training wasn&#39;t as much fun as Angela hoped. It started badly when the coach sent her back to the locker room to remove Jessie&#39;s ring which she had kept on her finger. Evidently there was a rule that jewellery had to be removed, a pretty petty rule as far as Angela was concerned. She tossed the ring into the beach bag in which she had stuffed a towel and a change of clothes to wear home.<br />
<br />
The exercise itself was alright. Jessie was a strong swimmer and the swimming skills seemed to come with the body. She was able to keep up with the other members of the advanced squad as they did laps. It was good to feel her young muscles at work. However after 20 minutes the laps became repetitive and the coach was continually berating her because she had &quot;Apparently forgotten what she had been told last week about doing turns&quot; Unfortunately for Angela she had no idea about what the coach was referring to.<br />
<br />
Angela&#39;s arms and legs were feeling very tired when it was finally time to finish. She gladly accepted a hand from one of the boys from the squad as he helped her out of the pool. The boy had entrancing blue eyes and a pleasant smile. Angela took note of his impressive muscular but lean body, with rivulets of water running off it. She also admired the green speedo style swimmers covering an impressive bulge. It was the body she had been trying to keep up with for the last half hour. She had heard the coach refer to the boy as Dan. Angela began to wonder if Dan was one of the reasons Jessie continued with squad training.<br />
<br />
Dan walked at her side as she made her way back to the change rooms. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the coach. He just pushes us hard because he knows we are the best swimmers in the squad&quot; the boy told her. He had a nice voice. Angela found herself replying &quot;It wasn&#39;t so bad&quot; Her hand seemed to be still tingling from Dan&#39;s touch. As they neared the change rooms, Dan told her &quot;See you Tuesday&quot; This time Angela only gave a silly girlish giggle in reply.<br />
<br />
Angela showered in her swimmers then dried and dressed. She didn&#39;t notice the small ring that fell out of the bag as she pulled out Jessie&#39;s denim skirt. It landed silently on her towel and rolled across the change room before settling unnoticed against the foot of a locker. Indeed Angela had totally forgotten about the ring. Her sole thought was wondering whether Dan would be waiting outside.</p>
