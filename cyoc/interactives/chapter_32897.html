<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ric and Josh looked frantically through the book to find something to help Mr. Mendes.  They flipped through pages and pages trying to find something to halt his weight gain.  They found the index, and looked for spells about weight.<br />
<br />
Mendes, however, was in the living room, grasping his swollen stomach.  The spell changed course.  His ass began to swell, his sides grew love handles, his chest grew plump, and his arms and legs began to lose definition.  He could feel his cock hard in his shrinking shorts.  He took a few steps forward to the living room mirror, spotting his now rotund body growing larger.  The feeling of expanding was amazing!  He didn't want to be fat though!  Mendes felt his shorts tear open, stitches popping on the seat as his ass outgrew them.<br />
<br />
All traces of his previous athleticism were gone.  He was a pudgy man in too small clothing.  The shorts fell to pieces, floating down to the floor, leaving him in a pair of briefs meant for someone half his size.  Mendes collapsed backward onto the couch, moaning, rubbing his stomach as it grew.  His underwear began to groan.  The couch creaked under him, each movement he made caused a slight wave to jiggle across him.  A low moan filled his ears, followed by a loud snap, and the white briefs shot across the room.  He felt his huge belly resting on his cock.  Struggling, he lifted himself up.  He seemed to have stopped swelling.<br />
<br />
Finally on his feet, he felt his stomach weighing him down.  He waddled to the mirror again.  His face was full and round, his chest puffy, a crease between it as it folded down, resting on his belly.  His body had widened, his hips were bigger, he had rolls when standing up.  Turning, he saw his now massive ass.  Backing up from the mirror, he saw his belly pressing down on his cock, which now looked a little shorter in contrast as it jutted out of his chubby crotch.  His thighs were touching...  he moved a bit, causing his body to sway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man.... what the hell just happened to me?  I'm...I'm a fatass!&quot;  He looked down, seeing his huge naked body, and waddled to the bathroom.  He couldn't let the boys see him this way.  His stomach bounced with each step, his ass quaked.  Everything was in motion.  He had only gone 10 feet and was already panting and feeling warm.  Waddling into the bathroom, he grabbed a towel and wrapped it around his waist.  It couldn't wrap all the way, but it was a start.  Groaning, he looked at the scale his boyfriend had left at his house.<br />
<br />
Marco, Mendes' boyfriend was a fitness nut.  A real muscle fanatic.  So he had a professional scale.  However, when Marco had moved into his new apartment, they found the scale was just a bit too big to take with him, so Mendes was holding onto it.  He gulped and waddled on.  He adjusted the devices until he was able to determine his weight.  Grasping his soft flesh, he gulped.  &quot;385 pounds...&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys had looked through the index, finding spells to increase weight, or appetite, and things similar.  The index pointed them to a page in the back for weight loss and weight reversal spells.  Ric flipped through, finally finding the page, but his heart skipped a beat when they found it.  Josh looked on, his eyes wide.<br />
<br />
The page was smudged.  Faded.  The spells were nearly impossible to read!  The reversal spell especially was hard to make out.  Aside from a few words, it was a blurry mess.  The weight loss spell was a bit more clear, but not by much.  They gulped, hoping Mr. Mendes hadn't gotten too fat.<br />
<br />
Making their way to the living room, they saw tattered clothes on the floor.  They looked to the bathroom door and knocked on it.  &quot;Mr. Mendes... are you alright?&quot;  Josh asked, sounding as innocent as possible.<br />
<br />
Mendes looked himself over.  He didn't want to scare them &quot;Oh yes boys, I'm fine.  I'm just using the bathroom.&quot;  He needed to buy some time to figure out what happened to him.  &quot;Say, boys.  I'm going to call the Ramirez family down the street.  How about you go over and play with Alex?&quot;  Mendes grabbed the cordless phone off the sink and began to dial.<br />
<br />
Ric looked at Josh and shrugged &quot;Sure... if you're sure you're fine.&quot;<br />
Mendes simply grunted out an &quot;mmhmmm&quot;  After a few moments he shouted back out.  &quot;Alright boys, Alex and his father are waiting for you.  Have fun now!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Mendes sat on the toilet and waited to hear the boys leave.  After a few minutes of being sure they were gone, he emerged from the bathroom.  Waddling into his living room, he plunked on the couch and tried to figure out what to do.<br />
<br />
After a half hour, he heard a knock on the door.  He stayed quiet, not wanting anyone to know he was home.  Then, he heard a key in the lock.  The knob turning, and footsteps in the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Francisco!  Are you here?&quot;  Shouted a deep, masculine voice.<br />
<br />
It was Marco!  Mendes shot from his seat, dropping his towel, and tried to run and hide, but his heavy body made the wooden floors groan loudly.  Then, around the corner peeked Marco.<br />
<br />
There he stood.  6 feet tall, 240 muscular pounds, green eyes and deep brown hair.  His mouth hanging open....<br />
&quot;F...Francisco?  What the hell happened to you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mendes gulped &quot;I-I don't know.  I just started swelling.  First it was just a few pounds, but they kept coming and coming... and soon... I was like this.&quot;  He frowned a bit &quot;I'm enormous!  I don't know how I'll ever lose this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco looked him over once more and said &quot;Well...&quot;</p>
