<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William returned from the school day at about four PM in relatively good spirits. His classes had been quiet and the students he didn&#39;t see the day before gave him the same treatment he had been receiving, a welcome to were society and an apology for Yvette&#39;s actions. In a way it was nice, but he was actually looking for things to really get beyond that. Sure he would have preferred having a choice of what were-beast to become when the time came for him to make that choice, but he wouldn&#39;t give up being a werefox even if he could now. And since Yvette&#39;s threat was passed them all, it was time in William&#39;s mind to head forward as he and his family continued to integrate into Moon Lake&#39;s were society.<br />
<br />
He opened the door to find that there was no action going on in the house. No sounds were coming from the kitchen or the living room, which was where he expected to find Martha or his sons. With that, he made his way upstairs in the hopes of finding Martha to see how her day went. He found her napping, naked, in her werecat form, on her back, on their bed, and laying in a sun beam coming in through the window. He smiled and approached her while setting his briefcase down beside the bed. She looked calm and peaceful, which made him figure that she didn&#39;t have too much trouble, which was a good thing. Her fur lay flat on her skin and her now generous curves and partially hid her nipples, making it clear that she wasn&#39;t aroused at the moment. Her fur didn&#39;t truly hide them, but one would have to look closely if one was to see them while Martha wasn&#39;t aroused. So, she might not be having a &quot;good&quot; dream, but it couldn&#39;t be bad either.<br />
<br />
William carefully sat down beside his wife and began to softly rub Martha&#39;s cheek with one finger. Her fur was warm and soft and it felt good to stroke it, and as he brushed it back softly, his fox told him that was a good way to show Martha that he loved her. It wasn&#39;t sexual, but it was pleasant and comforting. It was one of those things that William actually loved about being a werefox, knowing instinctively how to sexually please anyone but particularly his wife, who he did truly love, as well as how to assure her with just a touch. And that was what he was doing as he rubbed Martha&#39;s furry cheek and feeling the soft fur on her face below her eyes. After a few moments, William heard Martha begin purr and rotate her body on the bed to come closer to him. William chuckled and smiled. In a strange way it was actually like petting an actual house cat, and at the same time when he was in his werefox form, he actually enjoyed being petted by Martha, even if it wasn&#39;t &quot;heavy petting.&quot; It was a strange sense of comfort that he enjoyed while being close with Martha.<br />
<br />
However, he couldn&#39;t spend the afternoon stroking Martha&#39;s fur, as Eric and Nate were sure to return soon. He didn&#39;t know of Eric&#39;s trip to City Hall and Nate and Alex&#39;s trip to the library, and figured it would be time to get Martha up so that his sons didn&#39;t come home to find their mother laying naked with the bedroom door open. He began to speak to Martha softly as he continued to stroke her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha...&quot; William said softly, &quot;Martha...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her green eyes opened slowly and as she woke up she looked to William with a soft smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will...&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;I had a nice dream... were were welcoming a daughter into the world  just before Eric made us grandparents.&quot;<br />
<br />
William smiled, &quot;Let&#39;s let that wait until for awhile. We still have the boys to get through High School and College, you are going back to work... and we&#39;re going to be around for a very long time to come. We can wait to try for a daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded in agreement, &quot;what time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little after four,&quot; William answered, &quot;Nate and Eric aren&#39;t home yet... but I figured it might be a good idea for you to be up and dressed before they arrive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and looked down at her furry body. It was far sexier than how she had looked before they moved to Moon Lake, but that didn&#39;t mean she should be showing off her nude body to Eric and Nate. Nate might understand and be calm with it, as he was a were as well, but he was still her son. Being naked in front of him and Eric would be a bit odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you check the pot roast, see if it&#39;s done defrosting?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;While I get dressed...&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Martha came down a few moments later, back in her human form, fully dressed in an outfit that was closer to what she typically wore to teach in, as it was likely the best to make a good impression on Nate&#39;s boyfriend when they arrived. She found William checking on the defrosting pot roast. He looked at it calmly and as Martha approached he turned to face her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say it looks good,&quot; William told her, &quot;though... I don&#39;t think we need to start cooking immediately... unless you plan to eat at five fifteen...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha shook her head, &quot;Not that early. We can keep it in the refrigerator for a little while before we start cooking... it&#39;d then give me some more time to wake up and will let you relax after your day.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded and gave a small smile, &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t sound like a bad idea, and might give them a shot to meet Alex and have some small talk with him before they got into dinner. While they waited, they engaged each other in their own small talk with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how did your day go?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;Able to get into your regular class schedule?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For Tuesday and Thursday,&quot; William nodded, &quot;Yes. And things went well. There were still the welcome to were society and apologies for Yvette&#39;s actions... but there was nothing too out of the ordinary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did the Dean tell you anything more on when he could get a proctor to arrive... at least for the Moon Lake and Washington State tests?&quot; Martha asked as they sat down on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... he may have begun asking for them on a special request, but if he&#39;s made any progress I haven&#39;t heard of it yet,&quot; William replied, &quot;Sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;as I told you yesterday... the Moon Lake School District is going to be fairly tolerant on these issues. I will need to show that my certification has been updated to teach full time... but they at least need the record that I&#39;m scheduled to take the tests by May when school districts make openings for the next school year begins. That will give me plenty of time and to be ready. Getting an early take on the tests is just to serve as a pretest at the present time. If I pass, I can pass it on... and if not, I know what to work on specifically.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded as that made some sense with how things worked. Pretests were often something that was used to help teachers learn what their students already knew and thus build on the students&#39; knowledge as the class worked through the unit. It was something he had worked on when he first went through his own Education Major while in College. He even kept using it as he furthered his education to be an English Professor. He was sure Martha had done the same in her own education to become a teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; William said with a nod and a smile, &quot;How did your day go? I trust you didn&#39;t spend all day catnapping?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha chuckled and shook her head, trying to stifle her chuckles as she knew her husband was teasing her a bit. &quot;I did quite well, and no I did not nap all day. In fact, most of what I&#39;d done today was going over the material you collected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... how did that go? Do you need any help?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It went well with just a look through,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I may make some flash cards as things go to perfect studying for them... but that&#39;ll take time and will work if it takes awhile to get the Procter hear for the tests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me know if you need any help,&quot; William said to his wife, &quot;I&#39;ll do what I can when I&#39;m not at work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and placed a hand on his knee and gently squeezed it, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked to the clock in the living room and saw that it was now four fifty, and still, her sons had not returned home. She couldn&#39;t be sure where they&#39;d gone, but with Yvette in custody and no other threats known, she felt that both were okay and likely working on something. She shrugged for a moment and then returned to what she and William had been discussing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And from what I could see in the study material on some of the legal references... there are some of the things that I&#39;d thought of as potential problems when the laws were proposed on the news,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;No child left behind and common core and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
William watched quietly. He had followed them with some curiosity, but to a great extent, colleges weren&#39;t has heavily regulated by these laws because of the fact that college was not legally required to be taken and people paid to go to college. These laws had been aimed at the public schools that ran up to the Seniors in High School. Private elementary, middle, and high schools would also be affected by the laws. Some things did apply to colleges, but they weren&#39;t felt as heavily as they were at the lower levels of education. It made sense that Martha had more knowledge on these laws as they were would affect her job even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things can&#39;t be perfect,&quot; William sighed, &quot;and I&#39;ve heard some things that would indicate that the laws will be fixed... though I can&#39;t say for sure on how much things will truly change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they do get better,&quot; Martha said with a sigh, &quot;but as it is... there are still some issues that have to be followed as they are...&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded, &quot;Of course... of course... but that&#39;ll have to be done... and a good teacher like you would surely do well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Martha smiled to him, &quot;Hopefully things do turn out there..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; William agreed, &quot;about all we can do is do our best... Unless you plan to run for Congress or the President of the US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best... I&#39;d never survive the stresses that come along with politics,&quot; Martha smiled and then looked to the clock again. It now read five o-six, and Nate and Eric hadn&#39;t returned yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you suppose is keeping Nate and Eric?&quot; Martha then wondered, &quot;even if they walked home they should have gotten here by now...&quot;<br />
<br />
William looked up to the clock and sighed, &quot;I don&#39;t know... Maybe Alex got a bit of cold feet over meeting us... I mean... we were in a rather tough spot when we moved here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that is healing... rapidly healing and then some,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;Your bond as a werefox and me accepting what I am which has let my libido rise and fly free... Nate knows that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... but we don&#39;t fully know on when he met Alex,&quot; William answered, &quot;maybe they met before Nate joined his pack... before I was changed... things were okay, but not anywhere NEAR what they are now. Alex could be nervous and he thinks that anything &quot;good&quot; that&#39;s been going on has been a break between fights...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes no sense,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just speculating... maybe they&#39;re just working on their homework or having some other date before coming home for dinner,&quot; William replied as he and Martha got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Eric?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d bet he&#39;s hanging out with Julie somewhere,&quot; William commented, &quot;from the way he talked to me last night... I sounded like he&#39;s head over heals in love with her... and he&#39;s young enough that he can spend time with her without a care in the world. Especially now that Yvette is out of our fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha only smiled at that. She remembered the picture Samantha had showed her the previous evening. It all confirmed to her that there was just something about Moon Lake that proved helpful for everyone. She and William had come with a struggling marriage and with her repressing a good part of herself. And in their respective transformations, those had been fixed. She was comfortable with the duel nature of her sexuality and as a werecat, she could feel the higher nature of her new libido. It was a little lower than where it was immediately after her transformation, but not by much, and it had allowed her the confidence to keep up with her husband sexually, and that was even with the time she would have a girl&#39;s night with the Twists. And William&#39;s bond to her as a werefox had helped him realize completely who he loved and in its own way saved their marriage...<br />
<br />
When they&#39;d come to Moon Lake, she had been afraid that Eric would grow up alone and cut off from the world. Now he had met a little weremermaid and made friends. From what Eric had told her and William, Julie had helped him get used to Moon Lake, which was a good step. Then there was picture from the diner of Julie and Eric kissing, and rather passionately. Now, the mother in her hoped that Eric wouldn&#39;t rush to take things to a physical level with Julie, the picture did show that there was love between the two, and in that, Martha felt a great deal of relief with regard to Eric&#39;s future. He would happy, and that made Martha happy that he would happy, and the whole Anderson family seemed to be having such good fortune, but they were still waiting to meet Nate&#39;s boyfriend.</p>
