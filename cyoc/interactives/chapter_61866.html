<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that Jacopo was in the shower, it seemed a shame to just leave him how he was now. Tod looked through the computer to see what else he could change. He'd always thought Jacopo was a bit too small if he was honest with himself - Tod had a thing for truly huge guys, so huge they were freaky and would put even the biggest natural guys to shame. So he looked through the options and changed a few things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I will leave his height at six foot five and boost up his muscle mass a bit.&quot; Tod said looking at the 3D model of his friend on the monitor. &quot;What would be a good BMI increase, maybe an even one hundred pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tod changed the number in profile. Slowly the picture began to change.  Like one of those YouTube gifs, The 3d image of Jacopo grew in size. His shoulders and back thickened while his chest puffed up bigger. His abs and his oblics didn't get any bigger just more defined. Jacopo now had a well toned upper body just a step above a swimmers body but still shy of being a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should make his cock a little bigger like the rest of his body. &quot; Tod said pondering his next move. &quot;Nah … if it doesn't look right I can always change it later.<br />
<br />
Putting the thought of making Jacopo's junk bigger aside, Tod concentrated on the lower body instead. &quot;Now let's see what he would look like with bigger legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tod zoomed in on the legs until they filled the screen.<br />
 &quot;If I increase their girth by half that wil make them nice and big … But now they look way to fat … What if I were to reduce the total BFI down to a single digit … Now they look to skinny again … Damn it! Now I need to raise the total BMI up to double digits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tod was so intent on getting the legs just right that he didn't see that the rest of the body was changing as well. Off the screen, in cyberspace, Jacopo’s body grew larger and more defined.<br />
<br />
 Lastly Tod opened the personality tab and made Jacopo a bit more cocky and confident. He had always held his own, but Tod liked his guys large and in charge.<br />
<br />
Tod was literally shaking with excitement now. He couldn't wait to see what his creation looked like in real life now. Finally, after what seemed like years, the shower stopped running, and out of the bathroom stepped Jacopo.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to let Mom know that these hand towels aren't big enough for her &quot;little boy&quot; any more.&quot; Jacopo said as he walked out with a towel over his head.<br />
<br />
The bath sheet wrapped around his waist only covered one leg while the other was exposed from the hip down. The exposed leg was cut beyond belief. Every blood vessel, every muscle striation could clearly be seen under the skin. The legs were so large that Jacopo had that distinct bodybuilder gant as he walked into the room. After wiping the top of his head Jacopo tossed both towels onto his bed. Tod suppressed a gasped at what he saw. Before him stood the largest teenager he had ever seen. His looks reviled that of Rusty Jeffers.  Matter-of-factly he was just as big. From the top of his bald head down to his toes his overly muscular body was void of any body hair, except for his eyebrows. Even the groin area was hair free which made Jacopo's junk look even bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if I don't put on any clothes for now?&quot; Jacopo asked his friend. &quot;Mom doesn't like it when I walk around the house nude. &quot;But she didn't say I couldn't do it in my own room.&quot;<br />
<br />
His cock was only semi hard but it was still way bigger than a normal teenagers. The more it bounced off the massive thighs the bigger it got. Soon it was pointing the way around the room for Jacopo.<br />
<br />
Tod just sat there dumbfounded at what his friend had turned into. His friend was now the largest teenager he had ever seen. Jacopo's cock was board stiff and leaking precum where ever he walked and he didn't seem to care. Before his friend could get to the computer Tod changed one more settings on Jacopo's new base code. He increased both the girth and the length by five percent and pressed save.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you just do?&quot; Jacopo asked.<br />
<br />
Tod didn't like lying to his friend so he had to think fast. &quot;Just getting it ready for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I'd hate to think that what I might have to do to you if you started without me.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time Jacopo reached the computer his cock was twelve inches long and as thick as his wrist. As he sat down at the desk his cock was forced into an upright position.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Damn! If that didn't feel so good if would be painful.&quot; Jacopo said as he tried to pull the chair closer to the desk but his cock got in the way. The desk was still an arms length away and the keyboard was even further. &quot;FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! I need to fix this before I break something. Tod could you help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Joc, what do you way me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you go into my profile and make this thing smaller. I'm getting tired of it breaking through all my clothing all the time.&quot; Jacopo said pleading to his friend as he vacated the chair. &quot;And don't call me Joc. It makes me think I'm some kind of athletic supporter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tod was not about to reduce the size of his friend’s cock. After all he is the on that made it that big in the first place. Instead he changed the angle of it. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Jacopo's cock slowly point upwards. Now instead of pointing straight out twelve inches it would stick straight up twelve inches. No matter in what state it was in, hard or soft,  it would always pointing straight up. Jacopo would always be on display no matter what he wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;There does that feel any better?&quot; Tod asked his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you Do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I fixed your cock so it won't be in your way again. I made it point straight up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about it has always pointed straight up as far back as I can remember.&quot; Jacopo tells his friend. &quot;You use to hang your towel on it in high school gym class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tod was enjoying this emencely.  He could change his friend in any way and he wouldn't known any difference. What should he do next?</p>
