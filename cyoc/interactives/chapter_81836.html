<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next thing Ty did was sneak out of the house. He left Dustin small and physically regressed. He left Mark and June as they were. They hardly noticed him anyway.<br />
<br />
He needed a friend.<br />
<br />
Moments later, Ty was across the street knocking on the door of a worn down house with a filthy junk-filled porch.<br />
<br />
A greasy balding fat man in a wife beater opened the door and looked down accusingly. &quot;What do you-?&quot; He smiled when he saw Ty and laughed. &quot;Sorry, bud. Some shits down the street have been fucking with us lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, most of the kids that way are... mean.&quot; Ty shifted his eyes nervously. He never knew what to say around Mr. Andrews.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. But enough of that. Come in, bud. Manda's in her room.&quot;<br />
<br />
The older man let Ty in and immediately resumed sitting down in front of the TV with a grunt and watching the game with a beer.<br />
<br />
Ty knew the way well. Past a run down kitchen, down a filthy hallway with stained walls and cracks among family pictures, and into the second bedroom. Amanda Andrews.<br />
<br />
He knocked on her door and was greeted by the plump and tall teen and her infectious smile. &quot;Oh, hey, brat. Come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled, entered, and Amanda shut the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So!&quot; Amanda threw some CDs off the bed. &quot;What's up? Rough day? Wanna talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes. Sort of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; The big girl shifted, her meaty body relaxing as she rested against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I woke up this morning... and...&quot; Ty began, giggling. &quot;Well, I don't think you'll believe me, Mandy. So... I guess I have to show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay?&quot; The brunette chuckled, adjusting her glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch.&quot; Ty closed his eyes, and imagined the girl's messy room cleaning itself up. He heard an audible gasp from Amanda and opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What the hell?&quot; She looked around, blinking with shock. &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more!&quot; Ty gulped. &quot;I want to show you something else. But I kind of need your permission, because you're my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?&quot; Amanda blinked, so confused. &quot;Uh... for what? What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember how you vowed to lose weight this year? I know you've really been working at it, but maybe I can help you get a head start on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty!&quot; Amanda gasped. &quot;Y-You can... you can do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All I have to do is think about it. Can I try?&quot; He stared at her with an almost smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah.&quot; She whispered, awestruck. &quot;But... but how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a minute. Just take a deep breath and stay calm, okay?&quot; Ty concentrated deeply. Amanda had always been the picked on fat girl in his class. And as she had grown up she had only gotten bigger. In both height and girth. She was his best friend, confidant, and sharer of bullying. They understood each other. And now he was going to give something back to his friend. &quot;You're going to lose 10 pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Ty...&quot; Amanda gasped. &quot;Oh my God... I feel... I feel warm.&quot; She looked down at herself and gasped in freaked out disbelief as quite suddenly her impressive waistline began to shrink down. As were her flabby arms and thick thunder thighs. Weight was literally melting away from her and vanishing, seemingly deflating her body like a balloon losing air.<br />
<br />
The girl gaped in shock, watching her pudgy fingers thin down slightly, and gripped her neck to feel her second chin shrinking. Her gut had lessened, all of her had lessened. Her clothes were lose and saggy. When it stopped, she didn't dare do anything. She barely breathed. She just stared at her friend in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Ty said gently. &quot;I... I have this power now. I can do whatever I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God.&quot; Amanda said softly. &quot;That's... that's amazing.&quot; She held up her arm and marveled at the lessness of her weight. &quot;Can... can you do more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; She blinked. &quot;Can you make me... like, uh...&quot; She blushed deeply. &quot;Jesus. This is weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Ty beamed. &quot;But... now I'm intrigued! Come on, this is your chance, Mandy. No more Panda Manda. No more Fat Andrews. Come on. Let me do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The slightly less big girl stared at her friend in shock. &quot;Ty... that's... so sweet.&quot; She gulped and nodded. &quot;Okay. Let's do it. Take me down more. A lot more. Let me lose a hundred.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Here we go.&quot; Ty closed his eyes and concentrated.<br />
<br />
She gasped again, twitching as the feeling took hold, but this time shock and fear were replaced by delight. She was nearly 300 pounds when they had started. Very quickly she was losing a life's worth of excess in seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God... look at me, Ty! Look at me!&quot; She gasped, her delight turning to... something else. She was steadily and gently deflating now. Losing fat and sagging skin. Going from grossly obese, to obese, to just plump. From a blimp to a football.<br />
<br />
Ty blushed deeply. Amanda blushed deeply. They both knew this was her fondest desire. She had deflated massively, her body so much smaller and slimmed that her clothes were bags as she sat there on the bed. She gulped, nervous, and casually pulled her shirt down over her waist, kicking her pants away, ridiculously oversized on her more compact frame.<br />
<br />
Ty blushed deeper. Amanda blushed deep red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you...&quot; Ty gasped. &quot;Holy shit, Manda.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel... amazing.&quot; She admitted, gulping deep. She ran her hand over her smooth curves and grinned at her cute little belly. Just a little plumped out. Still fat but just getting there.<br />
<br />
Sitting there in her oversized blouse, she looked amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want more?&quot; Ty asked gently.<br />
<br />
Amanda considered for a moment, blinked, and nodded slowly. &quot;You... if you can.&quot; She whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the way down.&quot; Ty said gently, trying not to notice her quickening breath. He concentrated on making her skinny, tight, no excess.<br />
<br />
And he opened his eyes suddenly, losing his concentration in startled shock as Amanda moaned deeply. &quot;Yes!&quot; She bit her lip. &quot;Yes! I'm getting sexy! I'm getting thin and sexy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty gasped as his friend, so shy and reserved, lost herself as she attained her fantasy body. The last bit of her paunch fading back as she lost all her fat. Her body thin and lanky. She had lost all of her weight but none of her height.<br />
<br />
Sweating, horny, Ty couldn't deny his own feelings. Regressing Dustin had been an accident. Carefully dwindling his best friend as a gesture of love was far different. She was tall, and skinny, and sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take off your pants.&quot; Amanda asked gently. &quot;Please, Ty. I need you. I need to feel good. I need to thank you. Please, friend. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Ty obeyed. Soon enough his hard cock was exposed to the air, throbbing.<br />
<br />
All Amanda had to do was raise her shirt to reveal a tight nicely kept pussy, wet and ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it so we can't get pregnant.&quot; She added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done.&quot; Ty smiled, and she smiled back in excitement, giggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome!&quot; Amanda laughed, as she felt the tingle of the eggs in her ovaries vanishing.<br />
<br />
Ty slowly climbed on top of the newly skinny girl, slipped her ready cock against her wet pussy, and pushed.<br />
<br />
He slipped in gently, breaking her hymen, taking her virginity, and they both gasped as they quietly and passionately began to fuck. Slowly, at first, relishing it.<br />
<br />
Then faster. And faster.</p>
