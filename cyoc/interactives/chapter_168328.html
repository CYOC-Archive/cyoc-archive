<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec felt the pain from the earlier fight returning now that he wasn&#39;t filled with adrenaline anymore. While he wanted to go shop for some medical supplies, he felt that his other problem was much more pressing.<br />
He made his way back to the wizards guild, which was still open. No sign of Amber here either. <br />
He walked in and felt oddly relieved that the man from last time wasn&#39;t at the reception desk today. Instead a green skinned woman with long red hair had taken that seat and was working on something. <br />
Alec approached her and she looked up, her red eyes had a penetrating stare. It felt like she was looking right through him. &quot;How can I help you?&quot; Her voice sounded like a spring breeze, cool and welcoming.<br />
&quot;Hi...I...&quot; Wait, how do you start something like this. &quot;I&#39;m not familiar with how you do things around here. I think I&#39;m cursed and I need some help.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course we also deal in curses and cures.&quot; The woman smiled. &quot;What can you tell me about your curse so I can check correct departments schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec felt his face heating up. He was going to have to tell the hot lady that he, a not entirely unhandsome man, had a vagina. &quot;I...It&#39;s..uhm A little embarrassing&quot; Alec muttered. He looked around making sure that no one was near them.<br />
&quot;Curses rarely aren&#39;t embarrassing, that&#39;s why they&#39;re curses.&quot; Her voice had a lovely soothing effect on him.<br />
&quot;Someone gave me a va...err...lady parts.&quot; It came out as soft as a whisper, he just couldn&#39;t say it. He felt his face burning up.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; He was sure he saw her eyes check him out. &quot;Well, that&#39;s a job for body modification spells, charms and curses.&quot; <br />
Couldn&#39;t she speak a little softer?<br />
She typed away at her computer and smiled at him. &quot;Go through that door. They&#39;re quite busy, but I think they might be able to squeeze you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec hurried past and to the door she had motioned at. He was sure he felt her eyes follow him, but he wasn&#39;t going to turn around and check.<br />
He followed a short hallway and entered a waiting room. There was one other person in there already. He hastily took a seat and did not stare at the woman who was also in the room.<br />
At least he thinks she was a woman. She was of average build. She was bald, with pinkish skin. In the middle of her face was a pigs snout. She sat cross armed, 2 pairs of large breasts were resting on her arms and he was fairly certain another pair was hidden behind her crossed arms. <br />
She wore a piece of shoulder armor which covered her shoulders and upper pair. Her lower visible pair were covered by a green bikini top. She was wearing normal jeans and some pretty worn sandals. <br />
She snorted and Alec continued to not stare at her.<br />
<br />
He jumped in his seat when she broke the silence. &quot;You okay, you look a little pale.&quot; Her voice was much lower than he would&#39;ve expected it to. &quot;There is a water fountain there.&quot;<br />
She pointed to a corner, but quickly reverted to sitting cross armed again. Alec was right, she did have another set of breasts. What appeared to a towel was wrapped around them. Was she cursed into a pig form?<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, thanks. I&#39;m just a little nervous. And a bit shaken up, I didn&#39;t expect to be cursed like this.&quot;<br />
The woman laughed, her laugh sounded like a pig. &quot;Sorry about that. I was cursed. None of us expect that. Just happens, part of the occupation as an adventurer.&quot;<br />
She looked at him. &quot;You are an adventurer right?&quot;<br />
Alec was getting tired of that question. &quot;Yes, I am an adventurer. Want to see my card?&quot;<br />
The woman shook her head, her lower breasts jiggled. &quot;No thanks, I believe you.&quot;<br />
An awkward silence fell. Alec really wanted to know her curse, but was it a polite thing to ask? He assumed it was her pig form, but for all he knew there could be a piglike race in this world and she instead just had a rash on her ass. He briefly wondered if she had a cute little pigs tail.<br />
&quot;So...come here often?&quot; He mentally hit himself in the face. <br />
The woman laughed and snorted. &quot;Are you trying to score girls here?&quot; <br />
Alec blushed. <br />
&quot;Just messing with you. I know what you meant. This is my second time here. I was with a party trying to take out a witch. She won, I managed to get away. I need to get fixed so I can put together a new party and save my team mates.&quot; Her piglike face looked worried.<br />
So that&#39;s what losing to a witch could look like. What kind of rank could that mission have had.<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your deal?&quot;<br />
A door opened before he got to answer and rather boring looking man scurried away. An older man in a white wizard robes stepped out. &quot;Next please.&quot;<br />
The pig woman got up, still with her arms crossed. &quot;Hang tight dude, it will be all right.&quot; She winked and followed the wizard through the door. Alec craned his neck, but her ass was partially obscured by the towel she&#39;d wrapped around her lowest breasts.<br />
Another door opened on the other side of the room. &quot;Is there an Alec here?&quot; <br />
<br />
A surprisingly attractive wizard in a white robe was standing in the doorway. His dark slicked back hair, his broad shoulders and dark brown eyes made him quite the looker. <br />
When the hell did he walk into a soap opera? Back home doctors never looked like this. Alec felt an unfamiliar stir in his pants, an odd twitch or a clench. He hurried after the wizard into a plain room featuring a large desk with multiple seats and an examination bed. <br />
Some cabinets lined the walls, one of which was filled with a stand with rows of, what Alec assumed were, wands in different sizes. Several star charts decorated the walls.<br />
The white wizard took his place behind the desk and a screen popped up.<br />
&quot;So what can I do for you?&quot; He has with his hand on his desk and stared at Alec with his deep brown eyes.<br />
Alec met his gaze and took the opposite seat, sitting down cross legged. &quot;I have been cursed and I&#39;d like to be uncursed please.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what kind of curse would that be? Can you show it to me?&quot; <br />
&quot;I..uhh&quot; Alec hesitated, <br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help you if you can&#39;t show or tell me more you know. I am a professional, so no need to worry.&quot;<br />
Fuck it. &quot;I was cursed to have a vagina.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? That&#39;s a rare one, how did that happen?&quot;<br />
&quot;I got into a fight with a witch and I lost.&quot; <br />
The wizard frowned and started typing on his desk. &quot;And do you mind if I take a look?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m not happy about it, but if it helps.&quot; Alec got up and pulled down his pants. The cool air in the room felt different on his exposed ladyparts. <br />
The wizard leaned forward and stared at it intently. &quot;Fascinating. That&#39;s quite the curse.&quot;<br />
The wizard got up and walked to the wand display, he turned around holding a long narrow rod with a fat bulbous end. <br />
Alec felt his vagina clench. &quot;What are you going to do with that?!&quot; He did not like where this was going.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just going to sample..&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s got to be another way doctor!&quot; Alec panicked. &quot;You&#39;re not sticking that in me! I&#39;m a guy!&quot;<br />
The wizard looked at the wand in his hand.  &quot;Ohh, I never noticed it before.&quot; He chuckled and Alec felt a weird warmth spreading in his nether regions as his vagina twitched again. How the hell did he end up with the most attractive doctor. He wasn&#39;t gay, but his vagina seemed to like him plenty. <br />
&quot;No, I was going to say I was going to sample your morphic field. Curses tend to leave residual magic and with this wand we can sample it and determine the type of spell used. Also, I&#39;m a wizard, not a doctor.&quot; <br />
Alec felt himself relax slightly as the wizard moved the rod around his body, in any other situation this could&#39;ve been quite funny. &quot;Now I can do this without a rod, but it&#39;s more efficient with a rod and this way I don&#39;t run out of mana midway investigation.&quot; The wizard explained as he traced Alec&#39;s outline.<br />
<br />
The wizard stared at the rod. &quot;Odd, there is residual energy. But it&#39;s not curse energy.&quot; He sat down and typed on his desk.<br />
&quot;There has to be, I had a dick!&quot; Alec felt the panic bubbling in his stomach.<br />
&quot;Oh, I believe you. Can you tell me a little more on what happened? What spells or wands or movements did the caster make? Do you maybe know the name of the witch who did this?&quot;<br />
Alec pulled up his pants and sat down, legs spread. If he wanted to fix this, he needed to share more information. &quot;The witch was called Amber, she comes here as well.&quot;<br />
The wizard seemed surprised. &quot;Well, I doubt that Amber could do that. She&#39;s a decent spellcaster for status. But this isn&#39;t really something she can pull off on anyone but herself and for that she would need her power.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know her?&quot;<br />
&quot;I taught a few classes that she was a part off. What spells did she use?&quot;<br />
Alec thought it odd that he didn&#39;t inquire any further about the reasons for the curse, but it was actually a relief that he didn&#39;t have to explain everything. Alec thought back to a few hours ago. &quot;She cast flash of light to stop me from escaping...and she cast silence to stop me from calling...for help.&quot; <br />
Alec thought further. &quot;She also cast sleep at the end and when I woke up I was like this. Don&#39;t you have some kind of cure all or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Was that really everything?&quot;<br />
Alec thought back. &quot;No, wait she used one more spell. &#39;Magic mirror special&#39; I think she called it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Interesting. Okay, I&#39;m going to try something.&quot; The wizard grabbed another wand and waved it around. &quot;Cure all.&quot;<br />
A brief flash of blue light followed. Alec suddenly felt a lot better, he bruises appeared to have been healed with the cure all as well. But down below didn&#39;t feel any different. He checked his pants and confirmed no change. &quot;No change.&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think it would. Fascinating, so it seems she succeeded.&quot; There was a slight hint of pride in his voice.<br />
&quot;Succeeded at what?! Can you fix this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Amber had been researching her own power to try and leverage it somehow. It appears she may have altered the magic mirror spell somehow and bounced her own change to you.&quot; Alec just stared.<br />
&quot;Meaning, this isn&#39;t a curse but a morph. I can&#39;t uncurse you, because she morphed you into this.&quot; <br />
&quot;So how do we fix this? Unmorph? Or can you contact Amber to fix it? You knew her!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have her contact details, but she comes by about once a month. So you could wait.&quot;</p>
