<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AUTHOR'S NOTE: CONTINUITY ERROR IN LAST POST: Jance/Tabra <br />
doesn't have her armor on or customized yet. <br />
<br />
The kitsune prince Karther, was released back into the mundane world, in <br />
what was supposed to be just the first step in a journey of reunification with <br />
the world of the scientific, and the arcane. For the separation, it had been <br />
concluded, had done far more harm than good. Knowing of Karther's deviant <br />
and perverted nature, divinity had made Karther to swear an oath to rebuild <br />
his desert kingdom of the kitsune with women who were willing. <br />
<br />
But Karther's cunning mind had seen the hole in the oath, and had begun to <br />
abduct men, and transmute them into ladies of his own style of the kitsune <br />
race, and even violating their minds to make them little more than characters <br />
in his own private fantasy world which he sought to expand infinitely. <br />
<br />
This violation of free will ultimate drew the attention of the Angel Corp. Who <br />
sent an Angel of Freewill whose name started with T to resolve the matter who <br />
already assigned to Earth within a mortal coil. <br />
<br />
Just as Karther had finished kidnapped and converting another man into a <br />
lady of his already large harem, the Angel whose name started with T arrived <br />
and did battle. He broke the slavery on the newest convert and that of her <br />
friend who had been converted previously and had them flee. Karther <br />
converted the rest of his harem into warriors on the stop and had them attempt <br />
to slay the angel. <br />
<br />
 The Angel whose name was able systematically freed the harems vixen from <br />
Karther's mind control. But Karther in the chaos had switched with a <br />
doppleganger, and to add insult to injury, converted the newest of the <br />
escapees into his queen. <br />
The Angel whose name starts with T arrived just after Karther had had the <br />
second escapee, Janice, assimilated into his queen, once Tammy, now <br />
Tammia. <br />
<br />
T began to do battle with Karther and his queen, but caught off guard and <br />
outwitted, Tammia used her newfound magic to transform T into a second <br />
body for her. In this time, Karther realized something had gone wrong with his <br />
brainwashing, but his queen and her reflection used their newfound magic to <br />
calm him, making him as docile as a puppy. <br />
T, trapped within his own mind, dared the unspeakable, and opened up his <br />
True Wings upon the material plane, creating a powerful blast of divine <br />
energy. <br />
<br />
The result of the two magics mixing was T's body now being in the shape of a <br />
female one tailed anthro fox, and Janice's soul, somehow having pulled out of <br />
the mix of Tammia's body and into T's before she could be digested by <br />
Tammia's spirit.<br />
 <br />
Taking the name Tabra to better suit her new form, the remade angel again <br />
did battle, and Tammia, desperate to win and her grip on reality loosing, <br />
'borrowed' her prince's power, increasing her own dramatically, leaving <br />
Karther weak and almost mundane. <br />
<br />
The concubines, who had been making their own way through the castle, <br />
where the first to encounter the side effect of Karther's loss of control, his dark <br />
emotions and feelings (even for him!) began to manifest within the sand castle <br />
walls as sand wolves, who began to systematically posses all of Karther's <br />
slaves and subjects. <br />
<br />
Then the bad situation turned worse, as a wolf infected Tammia, the result <br />
was her going even more mad. <br />
<br />
Hooking up with the concubines, who had lost two of their number to the <br />
wolves Lucy and Natalie, Tabra/Janice lead the concubines to the exit of the <br />
castle, where Tammia and an impotent Karther were waiting. <br />
The queen had also created two shiva vixens Jennifer and Roberta (one <br />
converted soon into a wolf) to delay the concubines, while Karther's chef <br />
Alexandra, and perhaps most devoted follower (even for a brainwashed <br />
follower), for a very short time was given the honor of being Tammia's -third- <br />
body. <br />
Alexandra had briefly met the two escapees before a short while ago in the <br />
castle before Karther found them, and vaguely recognized Tammia as <br />
Tammy, but ultimately accepted every lie that Tammia told her concerning <br />
events, though Alexandra's only loyalty remained to Karther and Karther <br />
alone. <br />
<br />
Driven by a strange desire for even more power, Tammia assimilated the <br />
magical mass of the -entire- castle, resulting in her form becoming chaotic, <br />
and now bearing the name Tamthis, shifting between a massive male wolf <br />
form, a eight tailed she wolf, and even a similarity of Karther.  <br />
<br />
Regaining his reason for a precious short time, Karther was dismayed at what <br />
his queen had become. But Tamthis, still following her base brainwashing <br />
which was to please Karther and to make him happy, merely solved this <br />
problem by blasted Karther with a transformation spell that left him a loyally <br />
submissive minor FEMALE kitsune, 99.9% of his powers now within her. <br />
<br />
Tabra, knowing that she couldn't save Tamthis without killing her with the <br />
level power she had left, teleported the concubines and herself to a hiding <br />
countless miles away underneath the desert sands. <br />
<br />
Tamthis, was sad to once again lose his/her 'second body' but instead <br />
focused on rebuilding Karther's kingdom, that base desire still remaining <br />
within her/him. <br />
The kingdom of foxes now became a kingdom of wolves, with Alexandra, <br />
Karther, and Jennifer the only foxes left not converted into wolves now loyal to <br />
Tamthis. But with Karther now submissive to Tamthis, the vixens followed <br />
Tamthis believing they were still serving Karther. Even Tamthis believed this <br />
to be so. <br />
<br />
Cheating the oath once again, Tamthis converted several innocent children <br />
into wolf cubs to spread the curse onto their families, so they might all serve <br />
and protect their queen, being an official part of her kingdom in hopes of <br />
becoming recognized as an unremovable part of the world before she/he was <br />
decided too dangerous to remain. But all of this, remained in Karther's name. <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice meanwhile, tries to reconcile the problems that would arise if <br />
they could not find inner balance between each other before their spirits <br />
merged within the one body, fearing the new being might driven insane by the <br />
conflicting thoughts in her mind. <br />
<br />
At this point, a new player, Julio the wandering seeker of The Knowledge, by <br />
accident of divine design literally stumbled upon Tabra's hiding place. Giving <br />
Janice some revelations about his own life and the true nature of the world, <br />
Janice began to accept Tabra's existence rather than brushing everything that <br />
was happening to her as a delusion. <br />
Born in the first century BC, Julio had stumbled upon part of the blue print of <br />
the human spirit and how it parallel with God's self design and how to hot wire <br />
it to give one's self long life and various other minor divine abilities. This was <br />
The Knowledge, sealed away since Adam and Eve had taken a bite out of the <br />
apple from the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Driven by a desire to <br />
know God as a living man, Julio had wandered the world looking more piece <br />
of the Knowledge and had run into T many times in the past. These had not <br />
always been on friendly terms. <br />
<br />
The concubines vixens meanwhile, while considering themselves emotionally <br />
to all be sisters, were divided about what to do next. Barbera and Charlene <br />
wished to go home. While Keiko and Anna wished to start new lives for <br />
themselves as True kitsune. And four of them, Luna, Erica, the eldest of them <br />
Viki, and Lisa, wished to stay and fight. Tabra reluctantly agreed to the forth <br />
option, though she presented the plus and minus' of each choice. For to fight <br />
against Karther, they would have to fight with Tabra on her level, they would <br />
need to become soldiers of heaven, angels.<br />
 <br />
The transformation was painful beyond belief, but left each vixen much more <br />
than they had been before. Delivering the other four vixens to their chosen <br />
paths, Julio offered to train the four newborn angels in their talents, having a <br />
good deal of using divine magic himself of course. <br />
<br />
While laying some of the ground work for their fusion into one entity, Janice <br />
and Tabra agreed. Concentrating on retrofitting their armor for their new form. <br />
<br />
Julio's training at first seemed gratuitous, but upon a three on one training <br />
session, he quickly pointed out the new angels' absent mindedness along <br />
with their cockiness in their newfound power, and was able to floor each <br />
easily enough. Leaving each newborn angel humbled, and slightly <br />
enlightened. <br />
<br />
Tamthis meanwhile, had begun to create more of Karther's kingdom than just <br />
a castle. She had her children every great grandparent they had to her <br />
Karther's entry hall and throne room. Some walked, some had to be carried, a <br />
small number were simply 'lead:' Alzheimer's having taken it's bounty and it <br />
hadn't occurred to Tamthis' insane mind to cure their transformed brains of the <br />
disease. <br />
<br />
The gaggle of kitsune kits and wolf cubs nearly danced in front of their mother, <br />
bringing their elders to her like prizes. She always made it a point to assume <br />
her female shape when dealing with her precious children. Roberta stood on <br />
her right side like an automaton, waiting for any order to attack, constantly <br />
scanning the room for anything that might attempt harm her Queen and King <br />
(well, after last night, was it really right to call him a prince?). <br />
<br />
Tamthis gently removed Karther from her side who had almost molded herself <br />
to her Queen as the two of them had watched the cubs and kits bring them <br />
their tribute. Alexandra in a moment was on Karther to see to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;My beloved children.&quot; Tamthis stated standing up and looking down at her <br />
precious litter and their gifts to her. &quot;You have done well, very very well.&quot; The <br />
kits and cubs all giggled with glee at her praise. &quot;Now for your great grand <br />
parents, I have a special job for them, a -very- special job, one that I've saved <br />
just for them!&quot;<br />
<br />
The winkled anthros all listened eagerly for their queen's next words! The kits <br />
and cubs looking like a collection of goblins ready to do their master's next <br />
command. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shall be made into part of Karther's castle, to be one with it, your souls <br />
shall forever more constantly channel your king's magic evenly through it's <br />
walls and floors. Death shall never claim you, as part of this castle you shall <br />
not only live forever but be beautiful forever. You shall be free from want, <br />
sleep, old age and hunger. In this way you shall serve Karther's kingdom.&quot; <br />
<br />
The elderly wolvens and vixens all did their best to cheer at this great honor. <br />
A couple of the wolvens present moaned that they wouldn't be sharing in this <br />
honor. <br />
<br />
The sand, the only viable medium for Karther's magic, rose from the floor, and <br />
sprinkled over the elderly brainwashed anthros. The precious few of them <br />
wearing clothing found themselves joining their fellows in the fur. Years, then <br />
decades, melted away from them, in a matter of seconds the room was full of <br />
vixens and wolfens in their varying twenties. <br />
<br />
The pillars in the entry hall and throne room half way down became just sand <br />
again, assimilated quickly into the floor of the castle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now assume the places you will forevermore!&quot; Tamthis commanded and the <br />
young again vixens and wolvens obeyed without a second thought. <br />
<br />
Those who had been left behind with no one stood under pillars alone, <br />
assuming the most attractive and 'come hither' pose their imaginations could <br />
conceive of. <br />
<br />
Those who still had those dear to them at this late stage in their lives were <br />
quickly surrounded their loving wives. One wolfen even had five of his wives <br />
still with him, and they covered him lovingly as they all stood underneath a <br />
pillar. If the people of the middle east were appalled and dismayed at the <br />
carnal excess of the western nations, many would have died of shock at this <br />
scene. <br />
<br />
Tamthis looked, was satisfied, and with a wave of her hand, the grains of sand <br />
rose up, and covered the windows, widowers and the happy multi-spouse <br />
unions. From the outside, everything was still, silent, peaceful, beautiful. <br />
<br />
At what happened next: anyone with super natural senses would have turned <br />
and dry heaved.<br />
<br />
The fine layer of sand didn't stay fine for long. Flesh and bone layer by layer, <br />
was converted into sand, precisely, systematically like peeling back the layers <br />
of an onion. Yet the life force and soul remained exactly the way they were, <br />
while the minds of the 'statues' were feeling more naked than naked, felt no <br />
pain, but their spirits were absorbed from their living shells. The layers of sand <br />
reached the center of the brain and the vital organs.  To those with the vision, <br />
it was like watching someone be skinned alive. <br />
<br />
Their senses remained, they could feel, see, and hear, but they all were <br />
muddled, dulled and was their thinking. <br />
<br />
Then, once every part of them that had been their living bodies was just sand, <br />
the medium of Karther's magic, their life force began to flow. Like blood in the <br />
castle's veins, the life force of the foxes and wolves moved through the pillars, <br />
into the floors, up the walls, across the ceiling, and back into the pillars again <br />
to repeat it's journey again, and again, and again. For the spirits inside the <br />
pillars, it was like they had become liquid, and now they flowed painlessly <br />
and comfortably like water in a fountain. <br />
<br />
Their spirits' change however was particularly gruesome to those with the <br />
sight. Like seeing someone be changed into a cyborg by the world's most <br />
splatter happy surgeon. Souls, meant to learn, grow, evolve, change, were <br />
frozen in place, thoughts and idea picked and rearranged, memories throw <br />
out like left over body parts. Until the end result was something that <br />
resembled a living pump and transistor all in magical spiritual package.  <br />
<br />
Amazingly, there was method to Tamthis' madness. The many souls that now <br />
lay inside her pillar statues that were once they living bodies, were indeed <br />
balancing out the castle's power, and it's flow to the rest of Karther's growing <br />
kingdom. Making sure there were no wild spikes the like of which that created <br />
the sand wolves in Karther's original palace. And through it all, the mangled <br />
souls inside felt a simple, fulfilling and ultimately shallow happiness. <br />
<br />
They wouldn't be destroyed of course, to destroy a soul took more power and <br />
more time than nearly all angels possessed along with some deities. But they <br />
would be sucked dry, drained off into the sand, slowly, very slowly, until the <br />
consciousness inside had nothing of it's previous memories or identity left <br />
except the simple thoughts of a magical power regulator. Stabilizing Tamthis' <br />
power, doing little for Tamthis' sanity, it would prevent her power as it was <br />
from exploding from her and becoming a giant, insane, illogical, chaotic <br />
crazily colored pulsating cloud of conflicting magic changing things so <br />
randomly that a mundane mind would go mad from bearing witness. <br />
<br />
Yes, the great grand parents of Tamthis' children now did a very special and <br />
important job indeed. <br />
<br />
As for Tamthis herself, she just saw this as a way of getting ride of those <br />
annoying headaches that had been bothering her ever since she had raised <br />
the castle back up again from the desert sands. And it worked like a charm, <br />
she head stopping pounding, and for what counted for her, think clearly. <br />
<br />
The great grandchildren all gather around the pillars, looking happily at their <br />
great grandparents, seeing how happy they were, how beautiful they were, <br />
and how they'd never have to die like the ones who had been old enough to <br />
understand had feared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Children.&quot; She called out in a sing song voice to her little curse carries. &quot;Your <br />
mother had another little game she wants to share with all of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
The children's ears all turned towards her voice then hurried around her feet <br />
looking up at her like she was their universe, all with the same look in their <br />
eyes, all with the same grin on their faces, all with the same wagging of their <br />
tails. She knelt down, &quot;Now children, this game is very important to mother so I <br />
want your undivided attention.&quot; Suddenly the only thing the children were <br />
aware that even existed was their mother's voice. &quot;That's better. There is a -<br />
big- hill with lots and lots of tunnels and caves a couple hundred miles away <br />
from here, we'll take a big fun ride on the sand storms, then you'll go inside <br />
first.&quot; Thus did Tamthis explain the full details of the 'game' to her loyal kits <br />
and cubs. <br />
<br />
Several hours later, and hundred of miles away, men armed with machine <br />
guns and faith, wearing turbans and all with shaggy beards, were confronted <br />
with an attack they had no hope of having seen coming.  They had been <br />
prepared for armed soldiers with pale skin and blond hair and blue eyes <br />
(everyone knew all westerners had blond hair, blue eyes, and pale skin). <br />
They had been prepared for bombs smashing the hard rock the mountain of <br />
was made of. They were prepared to have plenty of warning as normal to <br />
scatter and regroup some place else. The sand storm meant nothing, it was <br />
their ally, they knew how to deal with it, these western pigs didn't have a clue. <br />
They would have their moment, they would show these infidels that God <br />
favored them, not the pigs and their greedy capitalist and degenerate nation. <br />
<br />
That was when some -thing- came out of the sand storm, the look out saw, first <br />
he thought it was just an animal, it was too small to be a soldier. It was furry <br />
like one, and had the face of one, even if he didn't quite recognize what it was. <br />
That was when the -thing- stood up on two legs, grinned at him with fanged <br />
teeth, and waved at him, more tails than he could count waving behind it. <br />
<br />
A demon! The man fired off several round into the thing that looked like an <br />
animal but walked like a man like those evil western made cartoons. The <br />
demon fell over backwards, bleeding from the holes on both sides of it's chest. <br />
The man stood up and slowly moved closer aiming his gun at the demon's <br />
head to make sure that it was actually dead. <br />
<br />
In a moment of total shock the sand around the demon 'leapt' up and dove <br />
into the holes that the man's machine gun had made, repairing the damage. <br />
The look out fell over backwards, dropping his weapon, his superiors would <br />
have been disgusted with his cowardice. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was too close, a little bit more and you -would- have killed her.&quot; Said a <br />
female voice. <br />
<br />
The look out looked up to see a larger demon like but not alike to the smaller <br />
one he had just shot. <br />
<br />
&quot;But don't worry, she'll be perfectly fine.&quot; The larger demon. &quot;Just like you.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man reached his weapon, but before he could aim it, his arms and legs <br />
were trapped in tentacles of sand. <br />
<br />
The smaller demon had gotten back up, still grinning. The man saw millions of <br />
smaller demons coming behind the larger one (fear did strange things to <br />
people's ability to count).  &quot;Your turn first dear.&quot; Said the larger demon. <br />
<br />
The smaller demon chomped into him, and he screamed, but his scream was <br />
cut short. In a matter of moments his body was covered in gray fur, tail came <br />
his rear, and his face was a muzzle. His clothes were quickly eaten by the <br />
same holding him. His fear and confusion were swept from his mind, he <br />
understood everything perfectly now. He looked up at his queen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Command me your Highness.&quot; The sand slipped loose from him and he <br />
stood up awaiting his first order from his queen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please be a dear and led the children through the rest of the 'ant hill' so they <br />
can find the rest of the 'ants' so they can be made part of King Karther's <br />
kingdom.&quot; His queen asked ever so nicely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course your highness!&quot; He bowed and happily led the kits and cubs down <br />
through the  tunnel were his fellow were waiting for their big surprise. <br />
<br />
Countless screams, gun shots, curses, prayers, and one or two escapees <br />
(accidents happened), the wolves (there were no women to make into vixens) <br />
marched out of the cave in single file, each other the exact same smile and <br />
eager to please look on their muzzles, all of them looking admiringly and <br />
submissively to their queen. <br />
<br />
Marching through the desert, using the helpful sandstorm as cover from pesky <br />
airplanes and satellites, the former bunch of men who killed families in the <br />
name of their families -but that was okay since infidels needed to be <br />
punished- stood in front of the castle of their queen in the middle of her city.   <br />
<br />
She kissed each of her children for a job well done and with a kind but firm <br />
'shoo' motion with both hands, she scattered her children, who obediently <br />
scurried back to their biological parents wherever they might be. <br />
<br />
Tamthis then changed to her much larger male form in much the same attire <br />
Karther DIDN'T wear in such a form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome my new subjects!&quot; He called to them, they all still thought of him as <br />
their queen even if he was currently male, brainwashing did that to a person. <br />
&quot;In time, an unknown force of unknown power will assault our kingdom, you <br />
shall be part of the force that shall protect it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolves all cheered at exactly the same time. <br />
<br />
Their cheers were silenced in a gasp as in the blink of an eye the sand <br />
underneath them engulfed each man in a melted pyramid shaped cocoon. <br />
Inside each man went through changes like those of the great grandparents <br />
earlier that day as their flesh became sand. Their spirits were crushed and <br />
pureed, mixed with the sand, their personal thoughts and ideas made into so <br />
much mush. Their Ego was made much smaller, their Super Ego more simple, <br />
their Id, refined into something frightening. <br />
<br />
The pyramids exploded as one, revealing massive wolf creatures, all of them <br />
standing taller than Tamthis. Their muscle mass was so huge that their bodied <br />
leaned foreword. Every muscle on their body was as hard as iron, their fur <br />
was so dark a gray to be almost black. Their solid color eyes held an <br />
intelligence of some sort but lacked anything that any culture in the history of <br />
the world would have called civilized. Many hung their tongues out from jaws <br />
holding teeth that were visible even when their mouths were closed. <br />
<br />
They smelled the desert air and growled. Their arms and legs were greater <br />
than tree trunks. The combined forces of Samson and Hercules would have <br />
been hard pressed to match strength against these beasts. Their claws <br />
dragged against the sandy ground as they hunched foreword. Their heads <br />
were relatively small compared to the rest of their nightmarishly muscular <br />
bodies. The thing between their legs, was a black thorn made of bone, <br />
looking ready to impale through the flesh of anything that lived. <br />
<br />
From her spot on the castle walls, Alexandra's only thought was that she was <br />
very happy those things she'd be seeing in her nightmares were on the side <br />
of her king. But couldn't they be on their side very far away? <br />
<br />
The wolf beasts stood their dully in the desert sun, looking down at their <br />
queen for his command. However the wolf didn't think of them however, and <br />
just turned around and called to one of her wolf maids. <br />
<br />
&quot;Laura, be a dear and fetch Lucy and Natalie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my queen.&quot; The she wolf bowed to the male wolf and hurried to carry out <br />
his command. <br />
<br />
Very soon, the two she wolves emerged from the castle walls and bowed, <br />
&quot;What is thy bidding our queen?&quot; Lucy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lucy, Natalie, you served as my king's harem before he chose that I alone <br />
was all he needed.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two she wolves in spite of themselves shuddered with a shadow of the <br />
envy Alexandra felt. <br />
<br />
&quot;But you shall continue to serve him, for my stolen second body no doubt will <br />
ultimately return, having turned your sisters to his selfish cause of stealing the <br />
purpose and wholeness that the people of our kingdom have.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolves felt anger at these ideas. Though they had both been free for a <br />
time, the sand wolf possession had reset most of their programming, though <br />
their memories refused to properly line up. There was also the fact that the <br />
more destructive part of Karther's Id was now a part of them as part of the wolf <br />
possession. <br />
<br />
&quot;But you shall fight them, and protect our king. And be as my guardians! So <br />
together, we may protect our King Karther!&quot; Tamthis made a grand sweeping <br />
with his arms.  &quot;Roberta!&quot; <br />
<br />
The shiva she wolf obediently emerged from the castle wall as well, being <br />
little more than a machine at the moment, it was easy for Tamthis to <br />
telepathically contact it, and command it. However sacrifices would have to be <br />
made for the greater good of Karther and certain conveniences would have to <br />
be lost. <br />
<br />
With a wave of Tmathis' hand, Roberta changed. The shiva wolf grew an extra <br />
pair of arms, giving her six total. Her weapons changed shape, no longer was <br />
she just holding six scimitars, but two scimitars, two maces, and two spears, <br />
the Shiva wolf also grew a foot taller, her figure becoming more attractive. <br />
Sand armor now covered the wolf's forearms and forelegs as well as her <br />
torso. Her fur shinned more in the desert light. But what most amazing was <br />
her eyes, they were no longer empty and robotic, but once again held <br />
intelligence and thought. Though now robbed of the purity of being a <br />
mindless weapon, Roberta could now appreciate the intelligence her queen <br />
had restored to her. Her four tails fanned behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your Highness I thank you. Command and I shall obey.&quot; Roberta nodded. <br />
<br />
Tamthis smiled. &quot;Very good. And you shall.&quot; He placed a hand on his body <br />
guard's shoulder and she shuddered. He seriously considered giving Roberta <br />
a second head, but he wanted to see how this form worked out for her for <br />
now. He'd improve upon it more  when the time came. &quot;You, are my first <br />
Guardian. You exist to protect Karther's kingdom and no other reason.&quot; <br />
<br />
Roberta accepted this absolute truth. &quot;Yes your Highness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamthis turned his attention to Lucy and Natalie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Natalie, you shall be as our king's guardian and as our general!&quot; And the <br />
sand magic that ran deep in Natalie exploded. Her sand armor broke under <br />
the stress as she grew. She grew taller than Roberta until she was the same <br />
size as the wolf beasts. Her muscle mass quickly followed suit even if at the <br />
end she much more limber than her male counter parts. Two new wolf tails <br />
grew from her hips giving her a total of four. Her hair became like a mane on <br />
her back. Her claws became like the hardest knives that could sunder stone. <br />
<br />
The transformation left her only vaguely female, the lack of a lethal weapon <br />
between her legs being the most prominent detail. Tamthis again consider <br />
correcting that and making Natalie male like the rest of her troops, but put it off <br />
for the moment, she'd have time to change her mind later. <br />
<br />
He turned towards the -other- wolf beasts.  &quot;This one shall be your Alpha, you <br />
will obey her without question and without thought, only I or my king have the <br />
right to override her commands. And she shall obey myself and our King <br />
Karther without question or thought. She shall be the medium for my will <br />
among you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf beasts all howled. Alpha Natalie howled back but said no actual <br />
words. <br />
<br />
Alpha Natalie could understand everything that was said to her, think, plan, <br />
and act as an brainwashed independent being, but it was not her place or <br />
purpose to speak, and she understood this utterly, her purpose was to obey <br />
her king and to command her king's new elite troops. As it was, she kneeled <br />
and bowed to her queen in the name of her king. <br />
<br />
Tamthis smiled at the last 'normal' she wolf. &quot;Lucy. My third guardian.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do with me what you shall my queen so we might protect our king.&quot; She <br />
lowered her head. <br />
<br />
The sand engulfed her in an oval shape cocoon. The sand object shifted this <br />
way and that, the careful changes going on unseen inside as living flesh <br />
became sand, shifted and mixed, then became living flesh again. Finally the <br />
sand fell away to reveal Lucy in her new form. <br />
<br />
She had four tails now, and they swayed in the sandy wind. <br />
<br />
Her eyes were now colored solid obsidian, pools of black. <br />
<br />
There was a white diamond were her belly button had been. <br />
<br />
Her body was muscle toned without being muscle bound. Her sand armor <br />
was now in multiple pieces to allow for more movement, the sand constantly <br />
shifting shape to allow for now kinks in her body armor. <br />
<br />
The wings on her back, look similar, but they were nothing like the wings on <br />
the back of Tamthis' second body. There was another difference that only <br />
someone with spiritual sight could notice, there was no set of True Wings <br />
connected to her spirit. <br />
<br />
She willed a broad sword and scimitar out of the sand took one in each hand. <br />
<br />
She appeared alike to Tabra's recruits in only in the most crude, and shallow <br />
of ways. Like a cheap, boot legged copy. <br />
<br />
To mundane eyes she was rather beautiful, to anyone with super natural <br />
vision, she was a rose without it's scent, a book with blank pages, a photo <br />
album with smeared faces. <br />
<br />
She said with perfect calm and clarity. &quot;Your highness, I shall protect our king <br />
and slaughter those who would do him and our kingdom harm.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As I know you shall. Jennifer!&quot; Tamthis called out to the shiva vixen where <br />
she stood with Alexandra and karther. Seeing the vixen with his eyes, he <br />
moved the mana through the sand into Jennifer. In a matter of moments she <br />
had gone under the same upgrades as Roberta. Save of course she <br />
remained a vixen. &quot;Use this new power I grant you to protect our King <br />
Karther.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karther looked rather oblivious to have his/her named just called. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you command in the name of our king my queen.&quot; Jennifer bowed. <br />
<br />
Alexandra took one look at her improved ally and couldn't contain herself any <br />
longer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your highness!&quot; Alexandra called down from the top of the castle's outer wall. <br />
&quot;Please! Make me your weapon! So I might too better guard our king from the <br />
enemy! I offer myself to you without question or fear!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tamthis looked at Alexandra approvingly, loyalty beyond question as always. <br />
&quot;I shall seriously consider it. If I am inspired to a form with which you might <br />
better protect our king.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra gushed. &quot;Thank your highness thank you!&quot;</p>
