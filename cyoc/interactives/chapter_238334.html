<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connie lay in bed for the next hour or so, feeling the alien body she now inhabited, she tried not to get too worked up. Her mind raced, trying to think of how this could happen, was she always this boy? Was this some sort of nightmare? What happened to her body if she was changed into this? She received a text from one of her friends that jolted her back to reality.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Are we still on for coffee and shopping?” Brenda&#39;s text read.<br />
<br />
“Shit.” Connie muttered. “Maybe I should tell her I&#39;m sick or something...” After a few minutes she realized that wouldn&#39;t do it, if neither her husband or her daughter saw her differently, than Brenda probably wouldn&#39;t either. She sighed and responded that she&#39;d be running a little late, but they were still going shopping. She sat up, the loss of her voluptuous curves all too apparent, she looked down at her flat, scrawny chest, and sighed. Sitting there for a few moments she finally worked up the courage to get up and strip, she&#39;d have to take a shower before going out.<br />
<br />
She pulled off her clothes with hesitation, this wasn&#39;t her body, how could she get naked with him? But she was the one who was piloting the thing now, so she&#39;d have to &#39;man up&#39; some time. She got down to her underwear and stopped, she&#39;d seen a naked man before, but not from this view, was she really going to do this? After a few moments she huffed and practically ripped her boxers off and looked at her new cock. It was smaller than her husbands, but not by much, she went to touch it but stopped short, deciding that she didn&#39;t want to do that just yet she went to the shower.<br />
<br />
In the shower she cleaned herself quickly, finding her body wash had been replaced by one for men, as well as her shampoo, much to her dismay. Her hands feeling every inch of the teenage body she now inhabited, she felt her cock stiffen, the foreign feeling disgusted her a little, but she&#39;d have to live with that from now on she guessed. After quickly drying herself off she went to her vanity only to find her perfumes, lotions and makeup had been mostly replaced by men&#39;s products. She sighed and looked at the bottles, each one was pretty much the same as her old ones, but scented with things like sandalwood, bourbon and smoke. Her perfumes were replaced with body sprays, similarly scented to the lotions, and a distinct lack of her traditional make up, leaving just some eye liner, lip stick and mascara. <br />
<br />
“Guess I&#39;m fucking goth or something now.” She grumbled as she did the best she could with the make up, her pale, skinny boy face mockingly mirroring her movements as she did. With makeup done, making a cute looking feminine boy in the mirror, she went to get dressed. Unlike Kyle, her choices weren&#39;t controlled by the curse, she picked a dark pair of skinny jeans, a band shirt whose band she&#39;d never heard of, a silk button down shirt, she decided that she&#39;d at least try to rock this look the best she could. For shoes she didn&#39;t have much, a pair of skater shoes, a pair of boots, and a pair of running shoes. She sighed, and chose the boots, they went with the look she tried to throw together. After dressing she looked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“God I look like such a dweeb.” She groaned at her reflection. “I used to beat up guys like this.... maybe this is karma?” She paused. “IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?” She shouted to no one, “ARE YOU PUNISHING ME FOR BEING A BITCH?” No one answered, she sighed. “Whatever, let&#39;s get on with life Connie, just roll with it.”<br />
<br />
She went to grab her purse but found that she no longer had one, instead it was a wallet with a chain, she rolled her eyes and shoved the wallet in her pocket, hooking the chain to her jeans, and went downstairs. She started to notice just how much shorter she was, her old self stood at 6&#39;4”, she was just as tall as her husband, but it hadn&#39;t occurred to her that he now towered over her.<br />
<br />
“This kid is what? Five foot tall?” She stopped. “No. I&#39;m Five foot tall, this... this is me now.” She muttered. “But how?” She muttered, she huffed and grabbed the keys walking out to the car and stopped. “Do I have a license?” She pulled out her wallet and found that she did indeed have a license, the picture had been replaced by the boy she was now, but her name, age and all were exactly the same. She noticed a piece of paper behind the license and pulled it out, on it was a written doctor&#39;s notice certified by the state government that stated she suffered from a rare disease that stopped her from aging past sixteen. <br />
<br />
“That&#39;s.... convenient.” She paused, “No time to think about it now, I have to keep up appearances, I&#39;ll figure this out later.” She got in the car, adjusted her mirrors and backed out of the driveway. The drive to the shopping mall was uneventful, though she was distracted, she was able to stay focused. During her drive she noticed the obvious lack of breasts in front of her, but surprisingly found the lack of weight, and the fact that her breasts weren&#39;t in the way somewhat... nice? Maybe this wouldn&#39;t all be bad. Getting out of the car she walked to the mall&#39;s entrance to meet Brenda.<br />
<br />
“CONNIE!” Brenda ran up to her and hugged her, her breasts closer to Connie&#39;s face, she felt her cock stir, was she into women now? “Come on! We&#39;ve got a lot to do!” Brenda dragged her into the mall, Connie found her eyes glancing at her friends ass along the way, finding her plump friend sexually arousing, she tried to play it cool. Brenda sat there in the coffee shop chatting away as usual, Connie didn&#39;t even have to try and pretend that everything was okay, Brenda usually just talked and talked. During brunch she settled on the fact that she was now indeed bi sexual, glancing at not only Brenda&#39;s breasts, but also a few hot guys. “At least this won&#39;t hurt my marriage, I still love Donnie.” <br />
<br />
After Brunch, Connie and Brenda roamed around the mall, window shopping and visiting shops, what was different was that Connie found herself in several stores she never dreamed of going into. The music store, a comic book store and the alternative fashion shop, and what was much more surreal, she found herself not only enjoying this, but she even bought a few things that she thought were cute. People payed no mind to the pair, it seemed that she was a common sight, and was even flattered when she needed to provide her license and the slip of paper. <br />
<br />
“I hope I look a young as you do when I get to your age.” Said the woman behind the counter, Connie awkwardly smiled, feeling flattered, but still uncomfortable with her new self. Having finished in the mall Brenda and Connie parted ways with a hug and went home. On the car ride home, Connie thought about what she just did, noting that walking around was... easier, and that she had a noticeable lack of back pain. She didn&#39;t have to adjust her bra constantly, and didn&#39;t have to redo buttons on her blouse when they came loose from straining. <br />
<br />
“Why did I ever wear tight clothes like that? I mean it looked good but now that I think of it...” Connie said to herself. “Maybe I was wrong.... maybe this is a... reward?” She started to smile, “I feel younger, that&#39;s for certain, and things are a little easier now... yeah, maybe I&#39;m being rewarded.” She smiled as she pulled in the driveway, maybe this won&#39;t be so bad after all.</p>
