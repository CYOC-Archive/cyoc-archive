<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I could kill you but I won't&quot; Amanda said.<br />
<br />
You breathed a sigh of relief and asked &quot;So you're going to let me go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Amanda said. &quot;At least not as you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; you asked afraid of what the answer might be.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was able to reconstruct the ray&quot; Amanda said. &quot;Though I can't say what you'll become. The transformation is still random though it won't kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A small comfort&quot; you said. &quot;What if I become an inanimate object? I won't be able to find the genie's bottle then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it wouldn't be so bad&quot; Amanda said. &quot;I like this body and the authority I have now. If you go back I may not become what I am now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But think of the people who didn't make it&quot; you said trying to reason with her. &quot;You expect me to believe that you wouldn't want them to live?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the population was transformed&quot; Amanda said. &quot;Those that died did it to themselves. Well most of them anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are rival gangs all over the place&quot; Amanda said. &quot;People die in turf wars. Fortunately we don't have to kill too many since all but one gang leaves us alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess&quot; you said. &quot;That gang is composed entirely of men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are called Barbarians&quot; Amanda said. &quot;They are nearly as strong as we are. They encroach on our turf almost weekly. We try not to kill them but capture and transform them. However our bullets don't behave the way we expect them to. The wave changed the nature of most of the metal. Sometimes bullets will kill, sometimes they'll just stun someone. Other times they actually transform the person. Even knives are as unpredictable. If I stabbed you with a metal knife you may die, be stunned, or transformed. If I stabbed you with the same knife again there could be a different result.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to let me find the bottle then&quot; you said hanging your head. You had thought Amanda would want to prevent this but she seemed to like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't stop you from looking if you don't change much&quot; Amanda said. &quot;I think if we had continued working on the ray together we could have found a way to eliminate the random change. Perhaps we can still do that. Bring him!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Amazons guarding you opened your cage and dragged you out. You struggled to get away but they were stronger then you were. You had a little flashback to how the pigs would struggle to get free. It was a short walk to the room with the transformation ray. The Amazons dragged you to the center of the room where there was a circle on the floor. You saw Amanda working the controls in the control room through the glass window.<br />
<br />
The circle started to rise up revealing a cylinder and the Amazons let go when they were sure you couldn't get out. The cylinder connected with the ceiling and you knew what was coming next. You looked at the opening through which the ray would be directed. The emitter came down through and plugged the hole so the ray wouldn't escape. The cylinder, floor, and ceiling were mirrored to keep the ray contained within. The emitter began to glow red and you knew that in a few seconds the ray would fire transforming you.<br />
<br />
You closed your eyes and took a deep breath preparing for the worst. Just as you finished drawing in your breath the ray fired filling the cylinder with it's transformation power. You felt a tingling as it passed through you. The tingling grew more and more intense until it turned to pain. You curled up into a ball as you felt your internal organs shift. Your skin became really tight and then loosened again. Your dick became erect and you noticed that it was straight out. It throbbed and shrank. You didn't know what you were becoming but you didn't think that it had a very big dick if it had one at all.<br />
<br />
Your skin once again tightened in your chest then loosened. You felt like someone was pulling on all of your hair on your head. The feeling passed rather quickly. The pain faded into tingling and then nothing. You laid on the floor panting. It had felt like you had spent minutes in there but you knew it was only five seconds.<br />
<br />
You felt a cool breeze on your body as the cylinder retracted into the ground. You were helped up and Amanda said &quot;Well this is nice. You're still human. See if you can find her some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You took a shuddering breath. You were still human but you were a girl. You now felt the weight of breasts on your chest and the breeze playing against your new pussy. Your long hair was tickling your back down to your waist. You opened your eyes and discovered that you had to look up to Amanda. You had to look up at her before but now you really needed to. You had guessed that the Amazons were six foot to six foot five or six. You had been five foot ten but you seemed to have shrunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm guessing that you're four foot and a couple inches&quot; Amanda said. &quot;We'll measure you to be sure. Put her up against the wall.&quot; You were gently shoved against the wall and Amanda said &quot;Four foot four. That would make you seven years old and tall to eleven and short. By your development I'd say you are eleven. You're not an Amazon but we'll take care of you. Now for your new name. I think Ava Marie will do. I can't allow you to search for that bottle until you're older. We'll train you to fight and defend yourself so when you do set out to find it you won't be helpless.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn't want to learn to fight but you didn't have much of a choice. If you were going to survive to find the genie's bottle you had to learn to live in this world. Evidently that included fighting.</p>
