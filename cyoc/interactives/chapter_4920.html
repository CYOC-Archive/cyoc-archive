<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Who would have thought the captain of the basketball team would know so much about photography. The afternoon was spent with Sam teaching Drake some of the basic Wildman poses and movements and then snapping photos of Drake in action. &quot;This must be what the life of a super model is like&quot;, thought Drake as Sam shot roll after roll. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure are photogenic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never was before, must be the hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; It'll be hard choosing which shots to use for the calandar, which for the tee shirts...you're a treasure trove of merchandising possibilities. I've got to get these rolls developed. We can choose the best shots tomorrow.<br />
<br />
For Drake the following days were spent mostly with the coach working out, learning the routines, and adjusting to his new life. The evenings were spent with Sam developing publicity and a strong friendship. In no time the days past and it was the evening before Homecomming.<br />
<br />
Drake had just returned to his room, after his evening high protine meal and  was about to go meet with Sam at the gym when suddenly from out of nowhere Mike appeared. Mike was standing in the center of the room looking horrible and pale, lamp in one hand, totally naked, with and enlarged penus covered in sores.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get this thing away from me&quot;, Mike shouted throwing the lamp to the floor. &quot;It's totally evil&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What on earth happened to you?&quot; Drake asked staring at his roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to know. All I can say is it twists all your wishes for the worst. Whatever you do don't use it.&quot;  And with that Mike passed out on his bed. Drake took a blanket from the closet and covered Mike. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll talk tomorrow&quot; Drake whispered. <br />
<br />
As Drake started to head out his foot hit upon somthing hard and metalic. It was the lamp. He picked it up off the floor and stuck it inside his Gym bag. He grab a fresh set of towels and quietly left the room.<br />
<br />
Drake and Sam spent the evening rehearsing for the Homecomming game. After a few hours and a little one on one b ball. They headed for the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think your ready for tomorrow. You're moves look great! Sam said opening his locker. &quot;Remember, keep calm, everyone will be rooting for you. Oh, yeah, and have fun&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake headed for the first shower stall. &quot;I must admit, at first  I wasn't sure about all this. I've got you to thank for everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank that Chinese apothocary. You know there are times I envy you. If only I were as hairy as you.&quot; Sam sighed.<br />
<br />
Drake unzipped his gym bag and grabbed inside for the shampoo. Instead of the plastic bottle his hand grabbed the lamp. He had totally forgotten about the antique until that moment. Suddenly an idea flashed in Drakes mind. &quot;Why not have two Wildmen. Sam was his best friend. Why not share the glory with him&quot; &quot;Sam, I have a little surprise for you. You might want to take a look in the mirror&quot; <br />
<br />
Drake rubbed the lamp and as always the genie appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it is you master Drake. What is it you command?<br />
<br />
&quot; Genie, I wish for Sam and I to become the Ultimate Wellington University  Wildmen. Make us twice as big and strong as Darren, make Sam as hairy as me, make our beards an extra four feet long, and make it so we continue growing bigger stronger and hairier at a rate of ine inch per week. &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your wish is my command.&quot; The genie blinked his eyes and returned to the lamp in a puff of smoke.<br />
<br />
Mean while Sam had just finished undressing when a strange burning sensation engulfed his body. he staggered over to the row of sinks and peered into the mirrors. He could hardly believe his eyes. Every muscle in his body was expanding as if he had been excersing for twenty years. Bulge after bulge, skin rippling as new mass mounded beneath his flesh.<br />
Pecs, bicepts, triceps, delts, quads, abs no muscle was spared from the transformation. Whithin minutes he was hugh. Bigger than any Muscle Magazine Model bigger than any  Mr. Universe.<br />
<br />
Before he could start to enjoy his new phisique he noticed more changes begining to happen. His alreay hairy body began to spew forth more hair than he could imagine. The hairs thickened and darkened as if it were a viberant red sun set seen though a dense amazon jungle. The hairs continued growing, cascading into a vertual waterfall of hair over every inch of skin.  His firey curly red hair spiraled and coiled into tendril like ropes which serpentined to the floor. Next his beard began to blossom from stubble to full beard, to belt grazer, to nearly 12 feet in length. <br />
<br />
Stunned by the transformation Sam stammered &quot; Drake, you're not going to believe what just happened to me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can guess.  How do you like the new you?&quot; Drake asked emerging from the shower stall.  <br />
<br />
Sam could hardly take his eyes off his image in the mirror. Then behind him in the mirror appeared Drake as mamoth as himself. Sam turned an faced his enormous furry friend. &quot; How...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a confession, it wasn't Chinese tea. I need to show you something. It's in the stall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam followed Drake into the shower stall.<br />
<br />
&quot; Two weeks ago I found this lamp in an antique store. Turns out his has magic powers. I used it to make us both Ultimate Wildmen. I hope you approve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah... I'm not complaining! But why stop here? Can you make us even bigger stronger and hairier?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will continue growing, I've alrealy made sure of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's celebrate&quot; whooped Sam raising the shampoo in a toast.<br />
<br />
The water was turned on and the two hairy hunks began to lather each others hair suits. Their fingers gliged the each others fur as hands expolored every massive mound. The sensation was pure exhilleration.<br />
Moans and groand of pleasure filled the locker room.<br />
<br />
From the third shower stall Darren emerged. He had witnessed all. &quot;So that's it. Drake has a magic lamp. I must find a way to get it from him. But how?&quot; ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
