<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John said &quot;Well I thought about it and I think we should tell the truth. I was given these powers for a reason, and at some point I&#39;ll have to use them. Better to get it out of the way.&quot; <br />
Lauren responded &quot;I&#39;ll allow it, but this is a big favor and I&#39;ll probably have to pull a lot of strings... Speaking of big I need to be an adult to do these things.&quot; Lauren surged back up into middle aged adulthood and quickly sighed saying &quot;...God it feels odd rapidly growing breasts...&quot; <br />
Cindy nodded and said &quot;Yeah... it&#39;s a unique feeling.&quot; <br />
Lauren curiously asked &quot;Wait did you get young too? Did you find it refreshing?&quot; <br />
&quot;It was nice.&quot; <br />
Lauren thought for a second and said &quot;Alright Jane, I&#39;ll tell your teachers about this. You can then be introduced and show off your power if there is a volunteer. Also, I would like for you to meet me at the roof at the start of lunch.&quot; <br />
John had a bad feeling in her gut, but said &quot;Thank you Principal.&quot; and left the office by herself. <br />
Lauren had a grin and asked &quot;Say Ms. Mavis... think anyone else might want that kick?&quot; <br />
<br />
The process of getting introduced was in a sense easy. After the 520th attempt John hadn&#39;t stumbled her lines, or had a hard time explaining what she did, or caused mass panic with her powers. Rewinding time was pretty easy as it turned out. For sure John&#39;s existence as a Priestess of Chronos brought about so many different questions, but most everyone accepted that yes John was a girl and also yes John had magical powers.<br />
<br />
The start of lunch occurred, and John noticed that her math teacher Conner had wanted to leave faster than most of the students... John got up, packed her bag, and walked to the roof. Took a little while, but when she opened the door she saw there was a bunch of staff and teachers all around. There was Conner... Mom... the Principal... a large majority of the staff actually some with skeptical looks in their faces and some with anticipation. Quickly all eyes went to John, and the Priestess quickly asked &quot;Mom... what&#39;s going on?&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Well, the Principal wanted us to feel what it was like to be young and show off your power to everyone in the school... So she wanted you to make us all younger.&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;Alright, so shall I just do a blanket regression or are we going to line up or what?&quot; In the end with John being able to freeze time for everyone except her and everyone on the roof they were able to go in a single file line and end with no time having actually passed. A bunch of staff decided to become little kids again, but others like Coach Alexis decided to turn around sixteen or so. After all some of their jobs required some amount of physical power. Old Madam Silvia at 80 decided to go back to her twenties and have her hair luscious and dark... not to mention while John had found her not being attracted to boobs as much as she had when she was a guy... Miss Silvia certainly was bringing out her lesbian side... John looked out at the younger teachers who seemed happy and said &quot;Well if that&#39;s everything I&#39;ll be back here at the end of the day!&quot; and then stopped time altogether for everyone besides herself and got herself to the cafeteria. <br />
<br />
Slightly before John stopped time her close friends Kyo, Kathy, and Martha were chatting. Martha chatting about John&#39;s development at first, but Kyo also started talking about being abducted and being given some sort of remote... and then John literally popped into existence by them and said &quot;Hey guys, Did you hear about what happened to me?&quot; <br />
Kyo shrieked in surprised and said &quot;Umm... Yeah Martha was talking about it. So you made a pact with Being X right?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Chronos, the god of time?&quot;<br />
Kyo sighed and shook his head and said &quot;tsk tsk tsk John so naive. Just because someone claims to be god doesn&#39;t mean they are. Even if they give you magic powers and turn you into a fine fine lady.&quot; <br />
John noted where her friend&#39;s eyes were and said &quot;My eyes are up here bucko.&quot; <br />
Kathy grinned herself and said &quot;Still you&#39;ve had a night to do it right? How does it feel to be a woman?&quot;<br />
Sighing in frustration John responded with &quot;I have had no time to do that Kat. Had to convince my family, and spend time with them. Wake up early to convince the principal... Now I&#39;m going to need to order my Uniform and buy clothes.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Well how about we go shopping later. My homework load&#39;s been light and I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;d trust your mother with current fashion.&quot; <br />
Martha nodded saying &quot;Agreed, we should take John for some shopping at the outlets.&quot; <br />
Kyo said &quot;Great that we agree about this.&quot; <br />
The three girls gave Kyo a &quot;We aren&#39;t talking about you.&quot; look. While they had gone to the outlets together this particular excursion was a &quot;girls only&quot; one. <br />
<br />
The Courtyard had a lot going on, but the group didn&#39;t miss a little girl in pigtails run by in long but quick bursts. She stopped near them to catch her breathe panting and turning around and yelled &quot;You&#39;ll never catch me ALIVE!!!&quot; and then continued running. <br />
Coming after her was one of the Student Council members Yumi who was for sure slower and needed to catch her breathe a lot more often hugging and puffing yelling &quot;Get... Back... HERE!!!&quot; she stopped and muttered to herself &quot;Great... I&#39;m tardy and now there are kids running all over the place... What is going on today?&quot; She looked around trying to find the kid and then saw John and said &quot;Oh you must be new, Uniform not arrive yet? Well welcome to our school, I&#39;m Yumi one of the student council members. If you need anything don&#39;t be afraid to come to me.&quot; <br />
John a little confused said &quot;Thanks?&quot; <br />
Yumi continued &quot;I promise things usually aren&#39;t this hectic. Now excuse me while I try and grab these kids and bring them to the office and find their guardians.&quot; Then seeing a little kid dashed yelling &quot;GET BACK HERE!!!&quot; <br />
Kyo sensing a conspiracy said &quot;Shit! Aliens that gave me that remote must be turning people into children!&quot; <br />
Kathy sighed and said &quot;Seriously? John literally is the Priestess of a god of time and you think it&#39;s aliens that are turning people into children. Who was that little girl John?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;The Principal, She got a bunch of the staff and they all asked to be regressed. I didn&#39;t see much harm, and I&#39;ll turn them back to normal... Although maybe I&#39;ll let madam Silvia keep many of her years.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;I hope you know what you are doing. I&#39;d prefer to not be turned into a fetus or something accidentally.&quot; <br />
<br />
In front of John&#39;s vision came some text that read &quot;Saya Sato: Oh lord Chronos, if you may be listening please make Kathy into the immature child she truly is.&quot; John knew the name. Saya was one of the popular bitches that really had it in for Kathy. She probably heard the rumors and was doing that as a joke... still did she really need to-<br />
John heard Chronos&#39; voice tell him &quot;This is Chronos John, that was a prayer. When someone prays to me for something and you can give it to them then I expect you to do it. That is the price for the power to control time. I&#39;d consider it fair right?&quot; <br />
<br />
John sighed and said &quot;Sorry Kathy.&quot; Kathy had a curious look on her face as she shrunk down several feet leaving her as a toddler. <br />
Kathy yelled in her squeaky voice &quot;What the heck John?!? Just because I said accidentally I didn&#39;t mean-&quot; <br />
John explained &quot;Chronos wants me to grant prayers on occasion so he can get followers. Someone wanted you as a little girl so-&quot; <br />
Kathy grinned and said &quot;Oh is that all it takes?&quot; at which point more text appeared in front of John reading &quot;Kathy Morgan: Grow me back up and make me even curvier!&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;You know I see exactly what you pray?&quot; <br />
&quot;So you know what to do exactly right?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try...&quot; <br />
Kathy grew back up... and went a bit further... at the end Kathy wasn&#39;t a girl anymore or even a teen in highschool. She was now a young woman in a business suit... for sure she was now curvier. <br />
Martha said &quot;Wow... you look mature...&quot; <br />
Kathy asked &quot;Why am I in a suit though... and my voice is deeper? Am I older why?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;I control time, I can&#39;t just increase someone&#39;s three sizes. I just make them older and hope they can grow.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Well time to go back to normal I guess.&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;What are you talking about? I don&#39;t think I can change back a prayer. At least not right away.&quot; <br />
Kathy panicked asked &quot;Wait you&#39;re not getting another prayer right now?!?&quot;<br />
John said &quot;No... I&#39;m guessing Chronos doesn&#39;t like being tested.&quot; then more text flooded John&#39;s eyes &quot;Kyo Mazda: turn Kyoko into a lady as well.&quot; <br />
Martha said &quot;Well it seems like my prayer didn&#39;t&quot; then noticed that she seemed to have gotten a little taller... her glasses seemed to have changed brands and... &quot;John who did this?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;I think prayers are confidential.&quot; The lunch bell rang and John sighed not being able to actually eat anything and cursed herself. <br />
Kathy asked &quot;Wait... how are we going to go to class. We look like office ladies instead of students. <br />
John said &quot;The teachers are children, and you still look like yourselves just older. People would probably believe you today... See you guys after class.&quot; John left to her next class where...</p>
