<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After what felt like several days to her, Sarah eventually woke up in her bedroom hungover from last night’s party. As she was relieved that she got home safe and sound, she was shocked to see that everything looked much bigger than usual. Her body also looked different than when she went to Damian’s party. “What the hell happened to me?” Sarah thought as she looked towards a toy mirror nearby and saw that she looked more like a toddler. She was horrified to see that her hair looked shorter, her chest looked smaller, and there was a visible bulge beneath her crotch. It appeared that she was also wearing Hello Kitty pajamas. <br />
<br />
As she tried to move, she felt uncomfortable as there was something warm and squishy around her butt. She started to feel worried since this was very unusual for her. It was like someone cursed her as punishment for going out to a party with a bunch of teenagers drinking booze. Immediately, she started to wail loudly to where everyone near her bedroom could hear her. Out of her instincts to protect her daughter, Danielle rushed to her bedroom where she wore a bath robe and a diaper underneath. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay sweetie, mommy’s here.” Danielle comforted her daughter by opening the front of her crib and hugged her softly. “Mom, I’m scared.” Sarah said in her new babyish voice. “I know, sweetie. Mommy’s a bit uncomfortable with this as well.” She said to her. “Everything will be alright though.” She then smelled something near her, as if somebody pooped their pants. “Although it might be a little bit better when you get your diapee changed.” <br />
<br />
Sarah was embarrassed as her mom said that. She continued to cry as it made her uncomfortable. “Get this thing off of me.” She screamed as her mom tried to calm her down. “Don’t worry sweetie. I woke up with a dirty diaper as well and your dad had to get me changed.” She then got her daughter off from her crib and to her changing table nearby, where she used a steady stool to commence her diaper change. <br />
<br />
Danielle removed her pajama bottoms and undid the tapes of her used diaper, where she was greeted with a mush of poop beneath her seat. Afterwards, she had removed her diaper and wiped her bottom before getting a new diaper from below the changing table and put it on Sarah. She then wrapped her soiled diaper and put it in a nearby pail. Sarah was too embarrassed as she covered herself with her own hands since she didn’t want to see her diaper. Finally, she applied some baby powder onto Sarah’s new diaper before doing the tabs.<br />
 <br />
“There, now you’re all clean.” Danielle said in a cheery voice as her daughter was still embarrassed over the fact that she’s still wearing a diaper. “Sarah, what’s the matter?” She asked her daughter. “I don’t want people to see me like this.” She sobbed as Danielle seems to understand what she meant by that. “Look, we’re probably not going to be the only family that went back to being babies.” Sarah looked at her as she found that to be ridiculous. “Mom, this is probably some curse to me, all for going out to some wild party where I broke some of your rules.” She was outraged by what was happening.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it has anything to do with that. Besides, I don’t think could control what actually happened last night.” Danielle responded. “I think you are worried too much about what I said before you went there. You don’t have to be ashamed. Besides, I actually went to a couple of wild parties when I was your age and I got hammered by my ex-boyfriend.” Sarah felt a bit relieved when she heard her mom say that. “So, you’re not angry with me drinking some booze and making out with Damian?” She wondered. “No, not really. It wasn’t like I was there to stop you. You were just having fun.” She said in a comforting voice before she got Sarah out of the changing table. <br />
<br />
“Do you want me to pick out some clothes for you or do you want to do them by yourself?” Danielle asked as her daughter was only wearing her pajama shirt and diaper. “I think I’ll do it myself.” Sarah responded. “Good, then get dressed, brush your teeth, and meet me when you’re ready.” Sarah wondered. “Why, are we going somewhere?” Her mother giggled for a bit. “Well, I thought it would be nice to go out somewhere. I’m not making breakfast for today.” <br />
<br />
“Um… Okay then.” Danielle then toddled out of her bedroom before helping her baby brother get ready. As she went towards her closet and opened it, she was greeted with her wardrobe being suited for a toddler girl rather than her own teenage self. Sarah was shocked when she saw this, as she didn’t ask for any of these weird looking clothes. “What in the fuck happened to my clothes?” She was upset with the unexpected change. “This can’t be any worse.” She sobbed while having a hissy fit.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, Danielle came over to see how Sarah was doing and she saw her having a temper tantrum. “What’s wrong sweetie?” She asked kindly to her daughter. “I don’t want any of these clothes. I want my big girl clothes back.” Sarah yelled at her mom. “Okay sweetie, I know this is a difficult change for you but there’s nothing I can do about it.” She tried to calm her down. “Now let me choose your clothes for you, since you seem mad about it.” Danielle looked around her closet and saw a blue Cinnamoroll themed shirt. “Oh, this one looks great. Don’t you think?” She suggested to Sarah as she pouted.<br />
<br />
“Looks it’s either this or you’re wearing something with Barney the Dinosaur on it.” Sarah was stunned for a moment as she didn’t want to stoop that low into wearing something like that. “Okay, I’ll go with the puppy shirt.” Sarah said as she replaced her pajama shirt with it herself. “I assume you also want to wear pants as well?” Danielle asked as Sarah blushed. “Yeah sure.” She went back to the closet to find a pair of pants and saw a hot pink one that might suit her. “Is this alright?” Sarah felt okay with them though. “Yeah, those are good.” She then put them on.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I got to go back to help with your brother. Meet me downstairs when you’re done. Okay?” Sarah nodded yes before her mother exited her room. After that, she toddled towards the bathroom and did her morning routine before going downstairs to see her family. “Alright then. Let’s go to the car.” Danielle said as she opened the front door with her family and went to the garage.</p>
