<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That&#39;s alright Gursewak, I have another obligation to attend to.&quot; Harpinder said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, many blessings Harpinder&quot; Gursewak nodded and the two went their separate ways. Gursewak felt at peace to return to his dorm room. He decorated his half of the room in a calming manner with Punjabi furnishings, including a khanda flag on his wall. This was in stark contrast to the other half of the room. Gursewak&#39;s calm demeanor evaporated when he saw the confederate flag on his roommate&#39;s wall. His room mate hailed from the southeastern United States and unfortunately, as stereotypes would suggest, was outwardly racist. He was notorious among their neighboring classmates for directing his aggression towards minority students.<br />
<br />
His roommate, Kirk, didn&#39;t insult Gursewak when they were in the dorm together. However, that was likely only to reduce the awkwardness of the situation. The ugly glares Kirk shot at Gursewak made it obvious he hated the Sikh man, and Kirk had no problem sluring about other students of color in Gursewak&#39;s presence. He sighed and prayed that he could come to understand Kirk. “Ngh, my head” Gursewak held his forehead. Looking at Kirk’s confederate flag again, he recalled asking Kirk why he had it when they first moved in. Kirk explained it was a symbol of his heritage, not of hate. This... now made sense to Gursewak. In these memories, he found himself agreeing with much of what Kirk had said. His frustrations with how foreigners refused to conform, the way they threatened the prevalence of white culture. Was this Waheguru answering his prayer, was he starting to understand his room mate’s point of view? “No, not Waheguru... I’m a Christian. The reason I understand Kirk is because... I am like Kirk. I’m white!” Gursewak rushed to the bathroom and gasped at his reflection. “What’s happened to me!? I look like one of those rag-headed-“ Gursewak winced at his own insult, “like a Sikh man.“ He tried to wipe the brown off his face, but nothing came off. “Must be some stubborn make-up.” Then tried to rub the black out of his now thicker goatee “It must be died. Or-“ he poked his nose, feeling the skin. Then got a better look at his plumper lips and unibrow. “Is-is it real?” He lifted his hands to his Namdhari dastaar, but he was unwilling to take it off. “There’s no way I could have really changed. But these memories” Gursewak returned to his room in time to see that Kirk had just returned.<br />
<br />
”Uhg, you’re here?” Kirk scoffed, “I was hoping you’d be out”<br />
<br />
“It’s not what you think, Kirk. It’s me, Gus.”<br />
<br />
”Gus huh? Finally decided to go by a normal name?” Kirk sat down on his bed.<br />
<br />
Gursewak thought, “Gursewak is a normal name, one I’m proud to have” he shook his head and spoke, “No, you don’t get it. This isn’t me, I’m white, remember?”<br />
<br />
Kirk laughed, “You, white? I think you’ve been sniffing too much incense, Guru. You’ve been brown as dirt with a rag on your head since the day we moved in.”<br />
<br />
Gursewak stood silently with a pained expression. “He doesn‘t remember me! And that shit he called me... damn it, why does it feel so bad!? I-it’s not like I’ve been called a towel head all my life, or a terrorist.” he thought, but his new memories were telling him otherwise. “I have to change back. The last thing I really remember is going to the dean’s office. Did Harpinder do this?” He clenched his fists. &quot;I have to find that Sikh.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Knock knock, Harpinder weakly hit his fist against Rupi’s door. He took his good friend Satvinder’s advice and wore a blue bow tie that matched his turban, complimented by a short sleeved button up shirt. He expected to find more T-shirts and jeans in his wardrobe, but found it was mostly button ups and khakis. “I do enjoy looking spiffy” he reminded himself. He also made sure to replace the stretched out underwear under his khaki pants. He was glad that his roommate Harri wasn&#39;t home at the time, knowing that he&#39;d give unsolicited fashion advice. “Coming”a soft voice replied from the other side. Rupi opened the door, looking just as stunning as that morning, or even more so.<br />
<br />
”Good, golly, gosh-“ Harpinder stammered. He thought, “Get a grip Turbanator. You’re smoother than this”<br />
<br />
Rupi giggled, “Don’t just stand there, come on in” She took Harpinder’s hand, who was shakingly nervous, and lead him into her dorm. He was surprised to see that she was not alone. At the other side of the room were two of Rupi’s friends, the same one’s that were with her at the bake sale. &quot;You remember Karan and Preeti, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I forget? It&#39;s swell to see you again, ladies&quot; Harpinder winked, though with his thick &quot;fresh off the boat&quot; accent and nasally voice it came off as less than charming. Still, they both giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been too long, Harp. I can&#39;t stop thinking about those treats from the bake sale.&quot; said Preeti, the tallest of the trio with her thick and wavy hair down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of, you look a bit different from when we last saw you.&quot; said Karan, the one wearing a chand dastaar and one of the few women in the Sikh Student Coalition who wore a turban. &quot;Is that a new pair of glasses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah&quot; Preeti interjected, &quot;it&#39;s something else. You looked taller?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karan grinned, &quot;You only think that because he&#39;s wearing a tall dastaar. Though I do like that style on you, Harp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder attempted to flirt back, &quot;W-well you know what they say. Big turbans- the guys who wear them- they- they have uh...&quot; but he could only stammer<br />
<br />
Preeti pinched his cheek, &quot;I think the real difference is that he&#39;s shy today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay girls&quot; Rupi grabbed Harpinder&#39;s arm and lead him to sit with her at her desk, &quot;that&#39;s enough fun. Harpinder was nice enough to come here and help me study. We&#39;d like some time without distractions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karan nodded, &quot;We&#39;ll be heading out then. Call us if you need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy your time alone&quot; Preeti winked as they both left Rupi&#39;s dorm.<br />
<br />
&quot;So&quot; Rupi placed her notebook and laptop in front of them, &quot;where should we start?&quot; They both started working on Rupi&#39;s statistics homework. Harpinder opted to give her suggestions and tell her when she made mistakes, so that she could find the answer herself. He was surprised by how fast she caught on, but he was more surprised by how knowledgeable he was on the subject. Something was telling him he shouldn&#39;t know so much about statistics, but his memories told him he spent much of his youth becoming well versed in various disciplines. So he brushed it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You solved that one without me saying anything&quot; Harpinder grinned, &quot;You must be a Tony Stark level genius.&quot; He found he could be more confident when discussing their studies. Unbeknownst to him, some of his original Harvey personality and charm were showing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really all because of your help. This has never been my kind of subject. Poly sci is where I shine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a political science major? Will I be seeing your name in the ballots after we graduate?&quot; Harpinder wagged his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becoming an elective official does sound... attractive&quot; she emphasized that last word, shifting her chair closer to Harpinder. &quot;Whatever I do, I want to help give out people a voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d be lucky to have your voice speaking for us, the way you told off that bully this morning&quot; Harpinder chuckled ending with a snort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, before that there are lots of ways I want to get active in the community. Next year I&#39;m planning on running for a position on the Sikh Student Coalition&#39;s executive board. How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re so smart. I could see you being elected as the academic coordinator. Besides&quot; Rupi draped her arm around Harpinder&#39;s chair &quot;it would be fun to be on the board together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Mandeep suggested I run for next year&#39;s board too, but elections are popularity contests. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll vote for a nerdy guy like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just about popularity, Harp. The people will follow someone they believe in. You&#39;re smart, but they also see themselves in you. In your brown skin&quot; she held Harpinder&#39;s slim hand with one of her own. &quot;in your beard&quot; and she stroked his facial hair with her free hand. The nerd programming from Harpinder&#39;s dastaar told him he was too bashful to be so close to a beautiful woman, but before he could move she held on to the back of his dastaar. &quot;and in your handsome turban. These are what we believe in.&quot; Rupi planted her lips on Harpinder&#39;s, and the two embraced in an innocent kiss. As Harpinder&#39;s nerdy programming lost its hold on Harvey&#39;s mind, so too did the blue dastaar lose it&#39;s grip on his head. It unraveled and reverted back into the Sikh Student Coalition&#39;s &quot;Think Sikh&quot; banner. Harpinder himself reverted back to Harvey by the time his and Rupi&#39;s lips parted. His clothes turning into a stylish button up, long tie, and jeans that better fit his taller body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels like you believe in me a whole lot then&quot; Harvey grinned, his bliss from the kiss having temporarily alleviated his concern from realizing he had experienced yet another transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harpin- Harvey!?&quot; Rupi blinked, &quot;Hey, isn&#39;t that from Satvinder&#39;s study ground?&quot; she pointed at the banner on the floor.<br />
<br />
Harvey&#39;s face flushed red and he quickly grabbed the banner, attempting to hide evidence of his previous transformation, &quot;Huh, wonder how that got there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I don&#39;t know why I kissed you like .&quot; She covered her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t apologize. I was into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean that it was a mistake... I think we should call it a night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What- come on Rupi, we were having such a good time. Let&#39;s at least finish studying or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take care of that later&quot; Rupi closed her laptop, looking down &quot;I do appreciate you coming here tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harvey sighed, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll see you around.&quot; He stood and took his leave. Preeti and Karan were making their way back to the dorm in time to see Harvey leaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harv, leaving so soon?&quot; Preeti asked with a tinge of disappointment. Harvey didn&#39;t respond as he walked down the hall, clearly frustrated. &quot;Hey Karan, doesn&#39;t Harvey look different? Like, again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karan stared at Preeti incredulously &quot;Girl you are seeing things.&quot; They both went inside. &quot;He left early, what happened Rupi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Rupi said, &quot;we kissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Preeti exclaimed &quot;no wonder you two wanted some alone time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rupi shook her head, &quot;I kind of regret it. It&#39;s like before we kissed, I felt he had all the qualities of a great Sikh man. Then after I opened my eyes, I realized he isn&#39;t Sikh at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that it?&quot; Preeti asked. &quot;Harv looks fine as hell in that patka. If you want to see some Sikh qualities on him, we should get him in a turban.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Preeti, you are so superficial&quot; Karan said, &quot;It&#39;s not about how he looks, it&#39;s about having a shared culture&quot;<br />
<br />
Rupi pondered the image Preeti described, &quot;You know, he wouldn&#39;t look half bad in a turban.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karan shook her head in disappointment &quot;Rupi! Not you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Harvey arrived at his dorm, greeted by his room mate Harri. &quot;Hey stud, where have you been?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it&quot; Harvey stuffed the blue banner in his book bag and took off his long tie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, sounds like girl trouble. Give me all the deets!&quot;Harri grinned.<br />
<br />
Harvey sighed, &quot;I had a date with Rupi tonight. You should&#39;ve seen it man, she was all over me. But as soon as we kissed, she told me to leave. She treated me like two totally different people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two totally different people you say?&quot; Harri asked. He thought to himself, &quot;could this be referring to the transformations Harvey described in his notebook?&quot; He then said to Harvey, &quot;you know, I never did ask you why you&#39;re always wearing a patka these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harvey attempted to hide his nerves while thinking of a lie to hide the fact it was magically stuck on him, &quot;Well, the thing about that is-&quot; he was interrupted by a knock on their dorm door. Harri opened it to see a bulky namdhari Sikh in white clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking for Harpinder&quot; Gursewak said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, my name is Harri&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not you&quot; Gursewak shook his head, &quot;I guess his name now is Harvey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s calling Harvey by a Punjabi name?&quot; Harri thought. &quot;Hey Harvey, there&#39;s someone asking for you.&quot; Harri said.<br />
<br />
Harvey came to the door, annoyed to see another Sikh. &quot;Do I know you? Listen, if this is about the Sikh Student Coalition, I&#39;m not interested tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who am I?&quot; Gursewak furrowed his brow, &quot;You&#39;re the one who turned me into this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; Harvey joined Gursewak in the hallway and closed the door behind himself so that Harri couldn&#39;t hear. &quot;What do you mean I turned you into-?&quot; Harvey&#39;s memory as Harpinder that day started to come back to him, &quot;You&#39;re that bully from the library!&quot; Harvey whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bully?&quot; Gursewak clenched his fists &quot;I&#39;ll show you a bully if you don&#39;t change me back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hold on! I don&#39;t know how!&quot; Harvey held his hands up defensively.<br />
<br />
Gursewak reeled his arm back, but couldn&#39;t bring his fist forward, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me? Why isn&#39;t my arm moving?&quot; He involuntarily folded his hands and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
Harvey slowly lowered his hands as he came to a realization. &quot;At the Dean&#39;s office you said Namdhari are pacifists. You can&#39;t use your fists to get your way anymore!&quot; Harvey grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please I can&#39;t stay like this. I&#39;m begging you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, the way I see it you deserve this. You are a racist asshole, so let&#39;s see how you like it.&quot; Harvey enjoyed watching the tears stream down Gursewak&#39;s face. &quot;But, I guess I need all the help I can get if I want to get back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gursewak wiped his tears, &quot;What do you mean? This isn&#39;t your real self?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is as normal as I can get, and it&#39;s temporary. This stupid patka stuck on my head keeps turning me into a Sikh and I can&#39;t control it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean I&#39;ll eventually return to normal too? ... temporarily?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. You saw Harri, my room mate? He use to be white too before I accidentally changed him. But while I change back every day, he&#39;s been stuck like that for days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could be stuck like this for days!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chill! If we work together we&#39;ll find a way to reverse the magic. But first I need you to keep quiet about this around other people, including Harri.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does that matter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because only you and I have noticed the effects of the transformations. Other people will think we&#39;re crazy. Second, I need you to prevent me from transforming anyone else if I transform again. Remember when Dean Patrick mentioned Turban Day? The Sikh Student Coalition&#39;s president, Mandeep, gave me a bunch of Turbans to tie at the event. I&#39;ve kept them with me because I&#39;m afraid of what might happen if I improperly dispose of them. It uh... was actually one of those Turbans that made you... this.&quot; He gestured at Gursewak. &quot;Anyway, if I change and my Sikh self starts tying those Turbans at the event, you know what comes next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gursewak nodded, &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll help you, and you&#39;ll help me get back to normal.&quot; He left and Harvey returned to his dorm. Harvey was glad he had an ally, even if it was a vile person like the former Gus. Perhaps with his help, he would get closer to ending this crazy magic.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Harri felt that his suspicions were confirmed. Harvey&#39;s notes on transformation, Rupi treating Harvey like two people, the namdhari man calling Harvey a Punjabi name and saying he transformed him. Harri was ready to test Harvey&#39;s transformation, so he looked around their dorm for an appropriate fabric.</p>
