<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then with a corner of Jennifer&#39;s eyes she saw something that made her brain make a decision she might regret. She noticed a purple velvet underwear next to her mother&#39;s bed and she had to take them. Slowly one feet at a time she leaned herself towards the panties that glimmered like a red paint on a white wall for Jennifer. As she walked to the room she was hit the most vile and warm fishy stench as possible. The room itself looked better than any other room as it has less stains, trash or random piles of clothes on the floor but it reeked of something. Something sweet.<br />
<br />
Jennifer took a lungful of air as she found the smell appealing. It was like a perfume for her. Jennifer had no idea what it was but it smelled so good that she begun to salivate in front of her mother. She only took the small velvet underwear and left the room as quickly as she can. Inside her own room she made sure the stash the panties somewhere where her mother couldn&#39;t find them. She had to make sure it kept it&#39;s different smelling texture as long as possible before she would hand them back to her mother.<br />
<br />
As the midday rolled Silvia finally awoke from her slumber calling Jennifer to eat some breakfast with her. Silvia was pouring some coffee for both of them straight out of the saucepan. This was the &#39;girl breakfast&#39; by her mother&#39;s words. A small hardened bread, watered down coffee and cheap off-brand soda to wash the bitter taste. As Jennifer looked at her mother eating the breakfast she noticed how Silvia&#39;s eyes had visible dark patched under them. The midday sun illuminated the room as it seemed that the kitchen light had been broken for some time. Her mother&#39;s eating habits were sight to be seen. She would slurp her coffee, take a huge bit of the bread, soften it by pouring more coffee into her mouth from the cup. All this while she was looking at the cupboards full of canned and jarred foods. Silvia looked at the bean can, spun it twice in her hand and without asking told Jennifer that today they would eat these as she could get too fat for eating too much delivery food.<br />
<br />
The wooden kitchen table was broken and full of unwashed plates and a lot of disposable plates and cutlery. The kitchen sink was filled to brim with plates, used cooking ware, more disposable cutlery and such. It was a pretty much a huge mess that would take three days to clean from start to finish. There was five bags of black plastic bags gathered in one corner and while her mother was piling the sixth one she asked what was she doing up so early.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmm, sorry mom, had to use the bathroom. I&#39;m sorry if I did something wrong&quot; Jennifer replied as politely as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Okay.&quot; Silvia replied back as if she just wanted to ask.<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed her mother flicking throught the phone as the sat back down. She didn&#39;t want to ask her mother what was doing but from the left-and-right thumb movement she knew well what she was doing with the phone. She poured herself a third cup of watered down coffee. Even for a early twenty year old her mother&#39;s eating habits were all over the place as she watched her mother eating a whole loaf of old bread in one go one slice at a time.<br />
<br />
Silvia had a bit of a small potbelly and Jennifer wasn&#39;t certain if she was chubby or showed early signs of pregnancy. Silvia&#39;s tights, chest and bottom showed signs of gaining a bit of weight while her face and stomach looked good for her age. Jennifer looked at her own body and saw that she was also putting on some weight. She wasn&#39;t chubby, yet, but had signs of poor eating habits.<br />
<br />
As Silvia was finishing her meal she let out a audible belch as she patted her stomach.<br />
<br />
Jennifer gritted her teeth as her &#39;real&#39; mother wouldn&#39;t had done something so nasty and she would have even excused herself. Silvia stood up and went back to her own room to relax as the living room looked more like a storage space than an actual room to hangout. Jennifer was a bit confused as all the cups and plates were just left there. Her mother neglected the basic cleaning practices. Directly on top of Jennifer she heard a muffled sounds coming from speakers. It seemed her mother had made her own bedroom into her personal living room. Jennifer picked up high pitches voices from the voices as if she was watching some sort of japanese cartoons but it was more erratic. She clearly heard the voice thanking someone or something after a long jingle. The muffled voices had a lot of laughter and screaming.<br />
<br />
Jennifer now had more time to observe the kitchen and the living room as her mother clearly was not paying any attention what Jennifer was doing in the house.</p>
