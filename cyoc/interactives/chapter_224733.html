<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">~~ 80 Years Ago ~~<br />
Hinata Asaya was just a little girl when her family was wiped out by a rival clan, her parents and brothers slaughtered right before her eyes, she was a no tail cub so she could only watch helplessly as her entire clan died. The large red eight tailed fox man glared at her, foxfire raging around him. The only thing she remembered of him was his missing eye, his remaining eye looked upon her with nothing but pure malice and hate.<br />
He was about to strike her down like her family when bursts of light struck the surrounding area, decimating the enemy’s ranks. The red fox looked towards his attacker and before he could react his arm was flying off his body, he recoiled as his fire grew hotter and more violent. Suddenly he was clashing with a tall man in black combat armor, wielding a white sword that seemed to glow. The two imposing figures fought viciously, exchanging blows that would rip the earth and trees around them. Hinata didn’t remember the rest of the fight, she had passed out but when she awoke she was in the arms of the armored man. She could see his face more clearly; he had brilliant green eyes that shone in the night, his head was shaved and there were scars across his flesh.<br />
<br />
“It’s all right now little one.” His gruff voice had an oddly soft tone.<br />
<br />
Before he could speak again he was thrown back, dropping young Hinata. One of the rival kitsune had survived and was wielding a sword of flames, raising it up to kill her savior. <br />
In a sudden burst of flames a white fox tail emerged from her body and flames shot from her hands, destroying the fox man.<br />
The other human soldiers dressed in black immediately aimed their guns at her. <br />
<br />
“No!” Her savior shouted.<br />
<br />
“But Captain Cassidy, she’s one of them!” The soldier replied not taking his gun off her.<br />
<br />
The man with the white sword rushed impossibly fast and stood between the young kitsune and the soldiers.<br />
<br />
“I said no! She’s just a kid.” He defended.<br />
<br />
The soldiers lowered their guns, the man seemed to command respect that Hinata could not understand at the time.<br />
<br />
“Besides she saved my life.” He added.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir, but command isn’t going to accept this.” The soldier said.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I’ll handle Director Richards” Cassidy said picking up the Hinata, her tail disappearing as she lowered her guard.<br />
<br />
~~ Present Day, 2103 AD. ~~<br />
<br />
After that day, Cassidy had taken Hinata under his wing, she trained and studied and eventually became one of the best agents the Normal had ever seen. Even though the organization despised anything supernatural her endorsement by Cassidy allowed her to become an operative, even if others in the organization disagreed. <br />
Being a kitsune her father had told her that she would outlive all humans, eventually her adopted father would pass and she mourned him for months, eventually she would take up “Moon Slayer”, his glowing white sword that he had used to save her all those years ago. Hinata had grown over the years but still appeared as a young girl barely out of her tweens despite being over 80 years old, in that time her powers had increased and she now possessed four tails, rare for a kitsune so young.<br />
<br />
Hinata got dressed: she wore a white blouse buttoned up all the way, neatly tucked into a pair of high waisted grey suit pants with a simple thin black belt. On her feet were polished black dress shoes and her hair was parted and pulled into a severe bun, not a hair out of place. She prided herself on her prim and proper appearance, it helped others at Normal trust her, know she was on their side and shared their beliefs. Even though Hinata was a fox girl and was one of the creatures they’d sworn to defend humanity against she believed that the Normal was righteous, she wanted to fight for the people who had saved her and get revenge on the one armed, one eyed red kitsune who slaughtered her clan. Cassidy had raised her to be good and do what’s right, when he died she vowed to uphold the beliefs that had led him to save her.<br />
<br />
Once she finished making sure her appearance was impeccable she headed for the Director’s office. The black haired girl hoped that her mature choice of clothing would make her look more mature as she had the body of a high schooler. <br />
She walked up to the reception’s desk and saw a woman she’d never seen before: she was a beautiful Roman with red hair that was pulled into a tight ponytail, she wore a black blouse, buttoned up all the way of course, and a light grey skirt suit with shiny black high heels.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me ma’am, I was summoned to see Director Tomes.” She stated.<br />
<br />
The red head only looked at her one r before returning to her work on her computer before speaking.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Director Tomes is expecting you Miss Asaya.” She said in an almost bored manner. <br />
<br />
The receptionist opened the door for her and motioned for the girl to enter. Once she was inside she was greeted by Director Tomes, an old man who served with Cassidy before a werewolf had taken his leg. Hinata stood at attention with her hands clasped behind her back and her legs together.<br />
<br />
“Director, sir. I am ready for my next assignment.” She said in a composed and to the point manner.<br />
<br />
“At ease Agent Asaya.” The grey haired man said.<br />
<br />
Tomes turned to the Asian girl and handed her a file which she dutifully took, waiting for his permission to examine the file. <br />
<br />
“Inside you’ll find intel of upmost secrecy, we received this intel late last night and you are the only person I’ve told about this, as such you and I are the only ones who are aware of this.” He explained.<br />
<br />
Hinata read the file and couldn’t believe what she had read.<br />
<br />
“Is this accurate sir?” She inquired looking back up at him.<br />
<br />
“Yes Agent Asaya, and I want you to take point on this matter. Lately we’ve been trying to recruit members of species we have deemed abominations in the past. However I believe, that just like yourself, they can be molded into proper agents of Normal and serve our cause.” He explained.<br />
<br />
Hinata closed the file and looked at the older man. She was unsure that individuals such as these three could be made into Normal agents but she knew it was not her place to question him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we’ll place these ‘new recruits’ in a re-education program before you start their training.” He added, noticing her concern.<br />
<br />
she obediently did as she was told and proceeded out of the office. Before she did Tomes had stopped her, placing his hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“I know Cassidy did the right thing by taking you in, you’ve made the world a safer, more normal place. You’re an example to all the supernaturals that there is a better way of life: ours.” He added<br />
<br />
Hinata smiled, “Thank you sir, I won’t let you down!” She said happily.</p>
