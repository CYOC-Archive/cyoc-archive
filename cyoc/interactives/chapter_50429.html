<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>You and Ben look at each other, standing inside your house, right at the door and see 
an unknown in both of your eyes. You hear the wind rustle outside, blowing furiously, 
whistling and howling as it blows through the seams of the doors, trying to invade the 
house. You two know that you want to go in there, but you were both afraid. Ben smiles, 
places his hand on the door and turns. Suddenly, the wind picks up speed and flings the 
door wide open, knocking you and Ben back a little. Then suddenly, just as quickly as it 
rose, the wind died down and everything was calm again.</Br>
<Br>"Man... that was crazy, don't you think?"</Br>
<Br>You just nod silently, standing there in your Family Guy t-shirt with Brian the dog 
making some sarcastic remark along with your blue jean shorts that end just below the 
knee. You knew that even though the wind was going crazy, it was still warm outside from 
the above average summer temperatures everyone experienced during the day.
</Br>
<Br>"Well... I suppose we should get started. It should only take us ten minutes to get to 
the base of the mountain from here, then it is who knows how long till we get to the cave 
entrance since from what I have heard, you have to do a bit of hiking along a trail that 
winds right up the side of the mountain to the mouth of the cave."</Br>
<Br>This time, when you nod, you do it enthusiastically since you really wanted to see 
what was in that cave when no one had been known to go and come back. Granted, it may 
be dangerous, but you were a very adventurous sixteen year old guy and you didn't care 
what was there, so long as you can come back home and tell everyone about how you 
bested the mountain and the scary cave.</Br>
<Br>You and Ben hopped on your bicycles and pedaled down the sidewalk, talking the 
necessary deviation and quickly found yourself at the infamous beginning of the foot-
path.</Br>
<Br>Jumping off your bikes, Ben looks at you with a very serious look on his face. "So, are 
you ready to do this? Are you ready to show the whole town... no the world that neither of 
us are scaredy-cats and we will go to any length to find out what others tend to be too 
afraid to find?"</Br>
<Br>You nod in approval, silently as usual, and Ben just gave you a pat on the back with a 
smile. Then before you could blink, Ben was staring up the trail and you look up to see 
that the sun had finally finished setting and the night was quickly rolling in. As the two of 
you walked, you both tried not looking over the side of the cliff because you both could 
tell that you were pretty high up off the main ground. You knew that if you slipped and 
fell, it would be a long way down and more than likely result in death. Being wary the 
whole time, you follow close behind Ben who had always been a natural leader. Keeping 
your mind on the objective, not thinking of anything else, you both reached the mouth of 
the cave before you even realized it.</Br>
<Br>Peering into the cave, albeit slightly, you could head heavy breathing and a rough 
snort through what was probably large nostrils. You look at Ben, questioning what you 
were going to do now that you were both there and Ben looks back with a very blind 
stare.</Br>
<Br>In a somewhat of a whisper, Ben says "Well... let's go back! We are here, we know 
something does live inside and we can come back again after we report that there is 
something that lives in the cave."</Br>
<Br>You give Ben a very stern look, not very happy that he even wanted to do that. You 
keep looking at him as he turns to walk away, but is stopped before he could move an 
inch.</Br>
<Br>"Hey... you two! I know you are out there, why don't you come in and say hello?
"</Br>
<Br>With the sound of the voice, their fears were subdued slightly, since the voice was 
very deep and rough. You and Ben turn to face the entrance of the cave once more, then 
begin walking in. As you entered the cave, you were both a little shocked by what was 
inside. In the center of a very large cave that didn't go any where and provided a decent 
shelter for the occupant, was a large fire that was built like they would back in boy scouts. 
Looking beyond the fire, they saw who... no, more like what spoke to them. On the 
ground, sitting cross legged was a very large wolf and human mixture. At that moment, 
only one word came to mind of you both and that was <em>werewolf</em>!</Br>
<Br>Immediately sensing that you both wanted to run for the hills, the creature stood up 
on its massive hind digigrade legs. "What, you two scared of this little old wolf?" He 
finished with a chuckle.</Br>
<Br>"You my... er, um... friend... are not little."</Br>
<Br>"You are very observant young one, indeed I am not little, in fact nothing about me is 
little." He finished with a sly smile as he looked himself over, especially when he looked at 
his own package.</Br>
<Br>"Wha... what do you want from us?" You finally asked, breaking your code of silence 
for what Ben saw was the first time.</Br>
<Br>"Well... you both are my visitors for the first time in ages and I wanted to greet 
you."</Br>
<Br>"What do you mean, 'first time in ages'? There have been stories among us that the 
people that have gone missing went up to this cave and they never returned, nor were they 
seen or heard from again."</Br>
<Br>"Oh... you silly humans! I have been watching your kind for a while now and I know 
when something is being said to be a cover-up. I have also been watching your town very 
specifically and I will just say that there are more problems than either of you would even 
know. Care for me to enlighten you further?"</Br>
<Br>You both stare at each other, contemplating your decision. Then Ben, being the more 
courageous between the two of you finally spoke up and said ____________</Br></p>
