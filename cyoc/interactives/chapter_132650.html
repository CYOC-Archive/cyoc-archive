<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sid, Rick, and Peter walked into the clothing shop. They needed Halloween costumes for a party and had come looking for some. He man at the counter was extremely unhelpful. He had simply told them that the costumes would find them. <br />
<br />
“What are you guys thinking,” Sid asked. He picked up a skeleton costume and put it back down. “I don’t really see anything.”<br />
<br />
“We haven’t checked the back yet,” Peter proclaimed. “The costume might ‘find us’ back there.”<br />
<br />
The guys laughed but followed Peter to the back. There they sifted through more costumes until Rick pulled out three interesting costumes. <br />
<br />
“It says a ‘Human Costume,’” Rick explained. There was a question mark where the image should’ve been. The exterior was black, so they couldn’t see inside it. <br />
<br />
“Whatever,” Peter said. “We’re going to out late if we stay here any longer. Let’s just go buy them.”<br />
<br />
The boys walked to the front each purchasing their own. The man smiled and asked, “Would each of you give me your hand for a second?”<br />
<br />
The boys looked at each other but obliged, sticking their right hands out for the man. The man pulled out a strange device with a pointed edge. Before the boys could react, he quickly jabbed each of their hands at their thumb drawing blood. <br />
<br />
The boys recoiled. “What the fuck dude?” Rick yelled. <br />
<br />
“Now now,” the man said impatiently. He removed three small containers from the machine each with a bit of blood in it. “You’ll thank me later.”<br />
<br />
He inserted each of the containers of blood into a small hole at the top of the costumes. He handed the costumes individually to the suspicious men who hurriedly left the store and ran out of the building. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
After the boys reached their dorms, they decided to try on these ludicrous costumes. Sid picked up bus and read the instructions. <br />
<br />
“Remember to charge your costume,” he read. “Simply don’t wear it and for every second not worn it will receive one day of charging.”<br />
<br />
He snorted along with his cohorts. Before continuing to read it. <br />
<br />
“It is recommended to charge it at night,” Sid read. “Side effects from lack of wearing the costume include...strength? And uh...ability to levitate? To remove costume, simple say your name and followed by ‘Remove Costume.’”<br />
<br />
The boys opens their costumes to find that it was indeed a human costume. The fabric felt suspiciously like skin. It wore no clothes exposing everything. The boys however put the costumes on. The looked very odd. The zipper rand right up through their chests. They head lay behind them like a hood. A rather lifelike dick hung from each of them. Although the skin like fabric looked very muscular, the muscles lay limp on the boys. <br />
<br />
As they all zipped their costumes up, Peter put his hood all the way over him and the room was blinded by a flash of light. As Rick and Sid revovered, the saw in front of them something other than Peter. <br />
<br />
In Peter’s place was a very attractive muscular man, no costume. The guys were consistently short, Sid was the tallest at only 5’ 9. However, this gargantuan man was at least 7 feet tall. Upon closer inspection, the face looked like a more chiseled handsome version of Peter. <br />
<br />
“Wha...” said the new Peter. His voice was very deep. “Put your suits on guys.”<br />
<br />
Immediately, the two guys complied and underwent the same transformation. <br />
<br />
“Peter,” the new Rick said nervously in a baritone voice. “How’d you make me do that?”<br />
<br />
“Do what?”<br />
<br />
“You forced me to put on my costume.”<br />
<br />
“Me too,” emphasized Sid. “It was like I had to do it. I couldn’t fail to comply.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Peter said. “Do some jumping jacks.”<br />
<br />
The boys stood there. Peter went to stand closer to them but was suddenly pushed off the ground floating in air. He laughed giddily, guiding himself around and back to the ground. The other two guys tried the same thing and accomplished mobility in the air.<br />
<br />
“Man,” Sid said happily. “Out bed are too small for us now. We need bigger beds.”<br />
<br />
And like that, Rick’s singular bed and the other boys’ bunk bed expanded. The grew wider and longer, their sheets and pillows accommodating the size. The boys stood motionless, Rick suspended into the air. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Rick said floating up to Peter’s top bunk. “How is Peter supposed to sit up here now that he’s so big? The ceiling should be higher.”<br />
<br />
Indeed the ceiling and light fixture moved upwards allowing for space on the top bunk. <br />
<br />
“And this dorm,” Peter chimed in. “Is too small. We need it to be much much larger to accommodate us.”<br />
<br />
The dorm expanded. Their shitty excuse of a kitchen transformed into a full on five star restaurant. Their doorway grew to magnificent standards. Their bed are expanded further allowing for much more space to move around. A small table they had had expanded into a grand living room with an expensive tv. A pool table, foosball table, and an air hockey table materialized in an open space. <br />
<br />
Their small little college dorm had managed to expand to an expensive apartment. <br />
<br />
The buck naked men floated around, Rick went to the door and Sid to their now grand window. Rick noticed that although they had a grand door, the exterior appeared the same. Sid notice the same. Although their grand window seemed larger than three dorms, he cautiously entered the fire escape to see that their dorm appeared the same size. It was as if they guys had only changed the interior but not the exterior. <br />
<br />
As he floated back in Sid explained, “its getting late. We should charge these and use them tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
The boys removed their costumes and hung them up in their closet. Rick went to jump into his bed but instead floated downwards into it. As Sid entered his lower bunk, Peter climbed up to his. <br />
<br />
“You removed your costume right Peter?” Rick asked. He was staring directly at Peter. <br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Peter said pointing to the open closet. The three costumes were all hung up. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know what it is but,” Rick said trying to find the right words. “Your shirt looks tight on you. And Sid, you look a bit taller.”<br />
<br />
“The costumes must leave residual,” Sid said. He looked up to see Peter flexing slight muscles that weren’t there prior. Sid turned off the lights in the dorm, and the guys went to sleep.</p>
