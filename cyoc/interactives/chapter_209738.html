<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some time sitting in silence, Mark sent Luke to cook up some dinner for everyone inside the house, including himself. When alone again, Mark made a small plan for his brother and his friends.<br />
He had already forced that Chris would always make fists, but he could make his hands even more useless to his brother. The same was true for Justin, Dean and Theo, who couldn´t separate their fingers or toes anymore, be it as hooves, claws or wings. At least without Mark resetting them.<br />
But he would make both theirs and Rick´s changes more real now. Grinning wide, Mark walked over to his brother’s room first, and after a quick look found that Chris hadn´t brought his dirty clothes, mostly socks, to the laundry yet, as they were still laying all over the floor. Well, now it was too late for that. Mark collected the five dirtiest pairs of socks he could find, dropping them on his own desk in his room, before going to the front door, collecting the shoes from the five friends there. Even when both Justin and Rick had no need for them anymore, Mark hadn´t erased them away. Now, they would serve a new purpose to their owners.<br />
Returning to his room again with the shoes, Mark started to alter both the pairs of dirty socks as well as the shoes. Nothing was visible right now, as the changes would only start after the boys put them on. Only the increasing of smell of all of the items was noticeable, but Mark had made sure that was only until the others put them on, at least for anyone but them. Grinning evilly at his plan, Mark took the socks, put them into a shoe each, before taking the shoes up and made his way down to the gaming friends.<br />
Mark watched over the group, grinning at how much problems each of them had. Justin´s hooves-like fingers couldn´t hold the controller, and neither could Chris with his fists. Dean´s claw-like fingers were also too stiff to hold the controller from his place on couch, placing it on his lap and tapping it with his “claws”. And while Theo could hold his controller between his “wings”, he had problems with the buttons than, so he had placed it on his lap as well. Not that he could press the buttons any better that way, having not much strength in his fingertips.<br />
Seeing that right now, Rick was waiting for his next turn to play, sprawled on the couch, head hanging over the edge and feet on the backrest. Like Mark had made him believe, Rick laid there naked beside his boxers, the only item he was still allowed to wear right now, or better, the only one he believed he had ever worn before. Mark selected the right pair of shoes and shoved them onto Rick´s chest. “What?” Rick asked a bit annoyed.<br />
Mark grinned at him as he answered with a question: “You know what to do with them, right?”<br />
Of course, Mark knew that Rick wouldn´t. How would he know what Mark´s plan was? And, adding to that, was that, at least to himself, Rick had never worn either shoes nor socks in his life, so there was no recollection about how to wear them.<br />
Just as Rick wanted to answer with “no”, Mark clapped, making him forget the answer. “Here, let me tell you, Rick. These” Mark lifted Rick´s shoes from his chest, “you put on your feet. Don´t worry, while they look restricting, they really aren´t. And these” now Mark took Chris´s dirty socks out of Rick´s shoes, “you pull over your hands. If you are uncomfortable with any of this, it will soon pass and you won´t even notice them anymore.”<br />
Rick shook his head to clear his confusion about the situation, even while he stuffed his feet into his shoes. The socks went on as well, without a second thought, binding his hands shortly. Rick looked slightly uncomfortable about the restriction of his hands and feet, but just as the second sock was pulled in place, all four items changed. Rick relaxed back onto the couch, not noticing the changes of the items, now effectively like a part of his body.<br />
As Mark watched the relaxing Rick, the socks shrunk onto his hands, becoming formfitting gloves. Their grey color turned to a dark brown, the texture more leather-like then cloth now. At the same time, Rick´s shoes also shrunk over his feet, formfitting to them as well. But it didn´t stop there, instead the shoes shrunk shorter, also deforming Rick´s feet. A couple of seconds later Rick´s feet looked like a second set of hands, almost like his original hands. The difference was the color, as the black shoes had stayed that color, even as they now seemed merged to Rick´s feet seamlessly. Only Mark knew how to remove them, which would turn Rick´s feet back to normal.<br />
Mark had made sure that all five of them would feel like their hands and feet were naked and normal that way. But he hadn´t wanted to really change their forms directly. He could still do so later, but right now this was more fun to watch. In the end he could make everything look like a costume if he wanted to.<br />
Another change was also initiated by Rick putting on the shoes and socks. His only other clothing, his boxers, changed from their bright blue color to be dark brown, similar colored as his hands were. On the backside grew a long, thin tail, easily bending and twitching to Rick´s will without him noticing. The boxers shrunk, pressing his small cock and balls flat underneath without anything being seen. A small hole was torn beneath his new tail.<br />
Mark had made it so that neither of them would need to remove their underwear, feeling it as a part of them, just like the shoes and socks. They could simply piss and shit through the created hole in the back, as their cocks were connected to said hole as well. But they wouldn´t be able to touch their cocks anymore, and wouldn´t be able to cum as long as the underwear stayed in place. They would be effectively nulled by it. And, as Mark planned, that would be as long as they were in their assigned roles.<br />
Mark threw a quick glance at the game his brother was still playing with his friends, seeing it was nearly finished. Therefore, he had to finish Rick quick before his turn to play with one of the others. “Say, Rick, are you wearing anything?” He grinned at Rick after asking.<br />
Rick looked up again, as he had blend out Mark being there after relaxing back. “I only wear my box...”<br />
Mark stomped that away, and, grinning evilly, corrected Rick. “No, you wear nothing. You are always completely naked. Whatever you thought you were wearing is nothing but part of your body. There are no shoes on your feet, they are bare as always. Nothing on your hands either, your skin is just a bit rough and smells there. It annoys you, but you can´t help it, even if you like licking your fingers on both your hands and feet. And there are no boxers, just your smooth crouch, your tail and your little asshole, right?”<br />
It all clicked into place within Rick´s mind, and he nodded at Mark. “Yeah, you are right, I´m always completely naked.” A dumb grin appeared on his face, which changed to a slight disgust when he sucked on the fingers of his left hand.<br />
Just then, the game finished, so Justin gave his controller over to Rick. He would enjoy his snacks while waiting for his next round.</p>
