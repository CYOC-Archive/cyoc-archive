<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You feel bad that you accidentally left Gene without interest in girls, so you set the flashlight to a very low blue setting and shine it very carefully at the space between his legs. For a moment you consider turning him the rest of him back to a more masculine state, but then decide against it. He seems to be quite happy with his breasts and long hair, which gives you an idea.<br />
<br />
Since no one notices the changes and reality seems to adjust you figure you might as well have some fun. Besides, you know you can always change him back later and none of it will matter.<br />
<br />
Setting the flashlight to its highest pink setting and aim it at Gene's feet. The changes are instantaneous, his sneakers turning into open-toed sandals, revealing dainty little feet and pink painted toenails.<br />
<br />
Very slowly, you move the flashlight up a bit higher, ready to turn it off and hide it if Gene shows any sigh of looking down or noticing what you are doing. Luckily he seems more interested in people watching at the moment. Encourages by this, you move the light further up, watching as his pants grow tighter, showing off his shapely, feminine legs. When you get up towards his hips you take greater care, making an effort to avoid his groin and hopefully restored masculine anatomy. <br />
<br />
His hips widen under the power of the light, but you realize that it will be impossible to take things further without him noticing, unless you can think of some way of convincing him to let you shine the light on him.<br />
<br />
Looking him over, you note that his clothing is totally feminine now and that, combined with his long, flowing hair, gives you an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, between your hair and the way you dress, it's obvious you really care about the way you look,&quot; you start, hoping that you have made the right decision.<br />
<br />
To your relief Gene smiles at your comment, &quot;Yeah, I've got a pretty good body and great hair, so of course I'm proud of it. Melissa is amazed at how much I like that sort of stuff. She says I'm the first guy she's met who's actually fun to go to the mall with. The way I figure it is that if that way I dress helped me get a girlfriend like her I must be doing something right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your relief only grows, recognizing Melissa as a girl that he has been interested in for the longest time, clearly you have not only restored his masculine urges, your playing around seems to have helped him get the girl he wanted. This also presents you with the perfect opportunity to press on with your plan. Flicking the light to its lowest pink setting, since you already know that at that setting it is unnoticeable, you quickly shine it over Gene's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So have you ever considered trying wearing makeup?&quot; you ask as you watch his lips grow fuller, the angles of his face further soften and his eyelashes become longer and thicker.<br />
<br />
For a moment he looks puzzled, then shrugs, &quot;Yeah, I've thought of it, but I really don't know where to start.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perfect, everything has fallen into place for your plan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you're in luck. My girlfriend left this light at my house, it's some sort of special fashion thing, brings out flesh tones or something, and she uses it to help her find makeup in the right shades,&quot; you lie as you show the gender changing light to him, &quot;I think the way it works is you shine it on your face and adjust it somehow. When you get the light at the right setting, for your skin tone you can shine it on whatever makeup you plan on getting and if the colors look weird you know that shade won't work for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your explanation is utterly ridiculous, but Gene falls for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome, use it on me and then let's go shopping. I've got a date with Melissa tonight and I want to look my best for her,&quot; Gene says excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, just close your eyes, I don't want to accidentally blind you or something while trying to figure out how to set this thing,&quot; you try not to laugh as you say this.<br />
<br />
Nodding Gene closes his eyes and motions for you to begin.<br />
<br />
Setting the light to its highest pink intensity, you shine it on his stomach and his waist narrows, further emphasizing the feminine shape of his hips. When you move it to his arms and hands, a gold charm bracelet appears on his right wrist and his fingernails nails grow long and perfectly manicured, taking on a coat of pink polish to match his toenails. <br />
<br />
A quick pass over his chest causes his breasts to perk up a bit more, becoming rounder and enhancing his cleavage, while still remaining a c-cup, albeit a large c-cup. When the light reaches his neck an necklace appears, the little pearl bauble at the middle hanging down just above his ample breasts.<br />
<br />
Then you do what you have been waiting for and shine it on his face. Gene's lips become full and poutty, lipstick of a subtle pink appearing on them as blush appears on the smooth skin of his cheeks. His eyelashes grow even longer and thicker and eyeshadow appears. Lastly, pearl teardrop earrings appear on his now pierced ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Gene speaks, his voice a sultry purr, utterly female and seductive, &quot;Does that light of yours confirm that I know how to put on makeup and can I open my eyes now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you stammer, amazed at how utterly sexy your friend has become. If not for your already having a girlfriend and knowing that Gene is really your best, male, friend, you would ask him out on the spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; he opens his eyes, fluttering his lashes at you in a way that makes you start to blush, &quot;I want to be perfect for Melissa tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he notices you blushing and raises an elegantly arced brow, &quot;Dude, are you looking at my breasts or something? Because if you are, well, that would mean you were checking me out, and that would be so gay. You're not turning gay on me, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You start to sputter out an answer, but he simply lets out a bubbly little giggle and pats you on the shoulder, &quot;I'm kidding man, I know you've already got a girlfriend and all, I know you're not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you manage to say at last, &quot;No way would I be checking you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's been awesome hanging out with you, but I've got to go,&quot; he bends down to pick up a purse on the floor at his feet that must have appeared at some point during his changes, in the process giving you a wonderful view of his cleavage, thanks to the low cut neckline of his blouse. Looking up at you he giggles again, &quot;You're not staring again, are you? I mean I know I show off, but with a body like mine, who wouldn't? Still, it's weird when you stare like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
That said he winks at you, probably to let you know that he is still joking, gets up, turns his back to you, and then walks off.<br />
<br />
As he leaves, you shine the light on his back, causing his butt to become firm and round, finishing off his gorgeous feminine curves.<br />
<br />
You have a feeling that the way he sways his hips when he walks will really stick with you.</p>
