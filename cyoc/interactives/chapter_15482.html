<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex was grateful that it was the end of the day!  It was 11:00 and his mistress: mother, was going<br />
to bed, and he was able to finish his duties in the Kitchen and basements!  Going up to his quarters<br />
on the third floor, he took off his tuxedo.  With all his conscious energy, he tried to fling it to the floor,<br />
and stomp on it.  Instead, his body took it off, brushed it carefully, hung it on a stand, and ironed a <br />
clean shirt from the laundry to be ready for tomorrow!  After this was completed, his body was his<br />
own again.  He walked tiredly in his underwear to the bathroom.  He saw that he needed a shave again,<br />
but didn't feel inclined to do anything until the morning; I mean, after all he'd just have to shave again, right?<br />
He looked at his body in the mirror, noting the thick mat of gray salt and pepper hair on his chest, and shoulders.<br />
His stomach, though fairly large and hairy looked pretty good with his muscular looking arms, shoulders, and neck.<br />
&quot;I think I may need to find a way to get the Chronivac from Mom and fix this,&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
As he ruminated, the door to the bathroom behind him opened.  Turning around, he saw<br />
Miranda in the hall.  She was still a mature and very voluptuous woman.  The difference however, was that<br />
she was no longer wearing a maid's uniform.  Her outfit consisted of a leather bustier, and an elaborate contraption<br />
of garters, and belts holding up her stockings.  All of which she was wearing in the hallway.  In her hands, was a<br />
laptop and an emitter!  With a grim expression on her face, she pressed a button, and Alex felt a familiar tingling sensation<br />
go through his body.  When he could move, he said, &quot;Miranda, I have no control over what I'm doing!&quot;  &quot;Help me!&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to go back to normal!&quot;  Looking at him with indifference, she said.  &quot;The Mistress expects you in her quarters in<br />
half an hour!&quot; &quot;Be there!&quot;  Turning on her heel, she walked away without a second glance.  Alex felt the wind<br />
go out of him.  He knew that his body could continue to serve efficiently for, god knew how long, but mentally<br />
he was a wreck, and he did'nt know when he might crack.  He closed the door, and as he walked into the shower,<br />
calculated how much time he had before he could make himself presentable.  Looking down over the curve of his belly,<br />
he saw that his dick was very thick.  About the size of a beer can.  And, he had a huge silver ring protruding through<br />
his piss slit.  &quot;Just when it could'nt get weirder...&quot; he thought.  Getting out of the shower he toweled off, and noticed<br />
that he now had a small, thick, well trimmed, black mustache, on his otherwise regular butler face.  It looked good there.<br />
&quot;I'm tired of being changed!!&quot;  he thought.  &quot;If I have ANY control, then I have something to say about THIS!&quot; He said as<br />
he picked up a trimmer which was on the counter.  Turning it on, he quickly trimmed the mustache off.<br />
Noting his appearance, he turned around to get ready to get dressed.  As he started walking out, he felt a tingling<br />
sensation on his upper lip.  Turning around to face the mirror, he saw a full salt and pepper mustache adorning<br />
his formerly bare upper lip.  In a rage he stalked back to the counter.  Fired up the trimmer, and chopped it off.<br />
Brushing gray and black hair into the garbage can, he looked at his image.  &quot;Back to &quot;&quot;Normal&quot;&quot;&quot; he thought.  Presently<br />
his upper lip began to tingle again.  As he stood in front of the mirror, he saw a large gray handlebar mustache form, obscuring<br />
his upper completely.  Standing in shock, and staring at his modified image, he picked up the trimmer, and in a matter<br />
of seconds, reduced it to gray hairs on the counter, which he swept up and dumped in the toilet.  He stood on front of the<br />
mirror expectantly.  Presently, he felt the tingling sensation return. Only this time, it encompassed the whole area around<br />
his mouth.  As he stood there, a long, thick, white fu-manchu mustache, with a thick wide soul patch formed obscuring<br />
his mouth completely.  With the mustache and stubble, he didn't look so much like a butler, as a biker!  He started to fire up the<br />
trimmer again, when his body, sensing that time was passing, dropped the trimmer, turned around to go to his quarters,<br />
and get dressed in his suit and freshly ironed shirt.  He was able to make himself presentable: except for not having<br />
shaved, and having a huge white mustache. He opened the door to his Mom's room and walked in.<br />
&quot;Come here.&quot; said the girl  on a huge heart  shaped bed directly opposite the door.  His mother was now blonde and<br />
pretty.  In fact she looked like Brittany Spears!  While his Mom had been in her 40s, but still very attractive. This version<br />
of her had a small tight figure barely hidden by a tight but filmy suit.  She looked as though she was 19!  &quot;Try trimming<br />
your mustache any more, and you'll look like Rip Van Winkle!&quot; she smirked. He bowed and said, &quot;Yes Ma'am.&quot; &quot;Miranda....<br />
I mean, MISTRESS FIONA has packed our bags.&quot;  &quot;I need you to drive us to the airport, we'll be gone for eight weeks.&quot;  He<br />
felt a gush of relief, which he hoped couldn't be seen on his face.   &quot;They're over in the corner, there.&quot; she said gesturing.<br />
&quot;Load them in the Limo.&quot;  &quot;We'll be down presently.&quot;  Carrying them to a huge 8 car garage, he found the limo keys in<br />
his pants pocket as though they'd been there all day.  He loaded the bags into the big Lincoln, and finding a Chauffeur's<br />
cap in the trunk, placed it on his head, started the car up, and parked it in front of the door.  While waiting, he could feel<br />
his new mustache being tugged by the wind.  Regarding his image in one of the car mirrors, he thought that his appearance<br />
had changed again somehow?  It seemed as though his shoulders were wider, and his neck shorter?  His suit, as usual,<br />
fit perfectly though.  After a while his Mom &quot;Britanny, and his sister, &quot;Mistress Fiona&quot; walked out the front door holding hands<br />
and giggling.  Altough Alex had never driven before, he found that he handled the car with his big hairy hands like a pro: of course.<br />
After he pulled up to the airport, he got out, and opened the door for his passengers.  Miranda, was wearing a severe travel<br />
suit, and helped &quot;Mom&quot; get out of the back.  &quot;Mom&quot;, turned to Alex.  &quot;Simms, While we're gone, you will look after the house.&quot;<br />
She continued, &quot;I decided that you and your father; Sobiesky, will be the gay couple I got to house sit for me!&quot;  Giggling she said, &quot;I think<br />
it'll be best for your Dad!&quot;  &quot;Now, HE'LL know what it's like to have to accommodate a horny man all the time!&quot; she said while<br />
rolling her eyes.  &quot;Don't worry, I've given you the right equipment to keep him out of trouble.&quot; Turning around, Miranda and her<br />
exchanged a kiss, and walked off into the terminal together, holding hands.</p>
