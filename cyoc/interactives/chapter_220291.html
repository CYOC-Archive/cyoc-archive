<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate smiled at her. He already planned the next part of the show with Jenny to surprise Andi. He wrapped his arm around her waist to discreetly turn off her mic incase she started to argue. &quot;I think  next, we should tell them about our new show!&quot; As he predicted Andi questioned the change in script but the audience couldn&#39;t hear her.<br />
<br />
Nate looked out on the audience. &quot;I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed the Amazing Andy&#39;s Magic show, please join us next time for &#39;Notorious Nate and my lovely assistant the Alluring Andi&#39;, as we once again mystify and amaze with our impossible feats of transformation, this time I&#39;ll be taking the lead. Who knows, maybe next time we will end our show with a similar swap.&quot; Nate turned to the beautiful woman on his arm and winked at her. &quot;Maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered as Nate waved and bow. Andi, ever the show woman, bowed and smiled but spoke to Nate through clinched teeth. &quot;We are definitely having a conversation about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
The audience exited the lobby where they found Kristin on display. Vanessa was also in the lobby passing out flyers with information on how to find the next show for when they chose the location. Many of the patrons grabbed one, and a few stopped to talk to her about her performance. Vanessa admitted loving rehearsing with Andy and Natalie and confirmed she would be in the next one since Nate had asked her to join the show as a second assistant.<br />
<br />
Zoey walked up to her to return her crown and sash. She asked her where she should go to be restored but Vanessa just told her to &quot;enjoy the new perspective&quot; and gave her a wink. Zoey was uncertain if the wink meant she would be contacted later or not but decided to walk towards the exit. <br />
<br />
The pack of dogs that were the cheerleaders stood leading up to the exit, with six on either side. They had pom-poms tied to their tails, which they wagged as people walked in between them. Ot wasn&#39;t the longest magic show, all of it taking a little more than half an hour, but it sure did leave an impression. The entire student body would be talking about it and posting online for a while. Everyone was excited about what they would do at the next show.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
Kristin:<br />
<br />
Once again human, Kristin watched the footage of her being humiliated and turned into a mannequin on stage. She wasn&#39;t exactly proud of her shame fetish, but then again that was sort of the point of it wasn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
Since she was good friends with Natalie...er....Nate, he had told her about the chronovac after the show. After talking about it, he had agreed that he could make the occasional appearance at her fashion shows. She was working on would it be better to turn the runway models into mannequins,  build mannequins and dress them before turning them into people, or turning models into cloths other models would wear. Maybe a combination, she thought as she start playing her segment again.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
Sandra:<br />
<br />
The cheerleaders were returned to normal shortly after the show ended. The crowd at the next game was excited to see them back, but it seemed more than a few of them expected for a pack of dogs to be in their place on the field. A couple seemed disappointed. <br />
<br />
Sandra was over-all happy to be human again and getting back to practice as usual, but there had been something about being a dog she liked. She enjoyed the girl backstage, Jenny, scratching behind her ears telling her she was a good girl.<br />
<br />
She admitted this to her boyfriend Todd, which led to some...experimenting in the bedroom. After returning from the game, where she bossed everyone around as the cheer captain, she went to the apartment she shared with Todd where they could play their new favorite game.<br />
<br />
She already wore dog ears headband and a tail anal plug as Todd finished up with the restraints that would make sure she would be walking on all fours. Her heal was pressed against the back of her thighs as he checked the buckles to make sure they weren&#39;t cutting off her circulation. Todd then helped her with the paw shaped gloves she would be wearing. Sandra had to make a fist to get her hands in right so she wouldn&#39;t be able to take them off herself, nor use her hands for anything but walking. <br />
<br />
Todd held up the final piece of her transformation, even if it wasn&#39;t as amazing as the one Andy performed. A collar with a purple dog bone shaped name tag. The front side had her name, like a normal tag. Instead of a the usual phone address on the back, it simply read &#39;Todd&#39;s Bitch&#39;.<br />
<br />
Todd used his pointer finger to flip the tag back and forth. &quot;Last chance. Once I put this on, you&#39;re a dog and dogs can&#39;t speak. They can only bark, whine, and I can keep you this way as long as I want. It&#39;s a long weekend too, so its not like you have anywhere to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra leaned back on her shins and held her &#39;paws&#39; up in a slight begging position. &quot;Dogs only have to go where their masters take them anyways.&quot; She smirked. <br />
<br />
With a smile Todd placed the collar around her neck, and locked it. The key for it was on his key ring with his house and car keys. He ruffled her hair. &quot;Good girl.&quot; Sandra gave a happy yip in reply. &quot;In fact, I think you deserve a reward. How about we go for a walk later tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sandra the cheer captain would die from embarrassment if anyone saw the alpha female in a submissive position. Sandra the border collie on the other hand loved walkies. She gave a bark in reply and wiggled her hip to make the tail wag.<br />
<br />
Todd scratched her behind the ear in the way she loved. He checked the clock, doing the math when he would need to go to ensure the best chancd that no one saw them. Mentioning his pet play fetish in a game of truth or dare while his cousin Natalie had been in the room during freshman orientation had been one of the most humiliating moments of his life. However, now he wondered of it hadn&#39;t inadvertently led him to gaining the relationship he had always wanted.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
Zoey:<br />
<br />
Zoey had found herself being interviewed multiple times. Once by her family who didn&#39;t believe she was Zach, again by the police who used fingerprints and blood test to prove with the exception of a different chromosome, she was in fact who she claimed.<br />
<br />
The next three times had been by news stations, both local and national about her experience in the show and the speculation of Andy using real magic. They also kept asking her what her intentions were. She always said the same thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, attend the Notorious Nate show when it&#39;s announced.&quot; She hoped if she volunteered again, she would be returned to being a man.<br />
<br />
While walking in campus questioning if there was a certain way she could dress to increase the chances of being picked, she bumped into another student. The guy in question had been carrying a canvas, which he quickly dropped into  a puddle in the street. Zoey tried to quickly pulled the canvas out before it was ruined, only to feel herself be tugged back.<br />
<br />
She saw a car quickly speed by, destroying what remained of the painting and splashing her slightly. Her momentum and shock caused her to stumble against the artist, leaning against him for support.<br />
<br />
She looked up at him stunned first by what had almost happened to her, and then by his good looks. Zoey had never been into guys, but with her new equipment came new interests it seemed.<br />
<br />
The boy spoke first. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...wha.....yes?&quot; She responded eloquently. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head. &quot;It happens. Though I recommend you watch out more. First me, and then the car.... honestly I&#39;m a little worried. Are you sure you&#39;re okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing she was still pressed against him, she stood up, and gave him space, trying to hide how flustered she was. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m just dealing with some recent changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, something clicked in the boy&#39;s head and recognition lit up his eyes. &quot;You&#39;re Zoey, from the magic show!&quot;<br />
<br />
She blushed slightly, and for reasons she couldn&#39;t explain, gave a curtsy. Zoey mostly owned skirts since all of her fashion advice came from her now ex-girlfriend/ current BFF who seemed to delight in making her as girly as possible. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Joel.&quot; The boy told her. &quot;I&#39;m an art student. I was in the audience during the show, and I wanted to ask you something since I first saw you. Can I paint you?&quot;<br />
<br />
A stray thouht went through her head. &#39;You could paint me like one of those French girls.&#39; Out loud she gave a more restrained, &quot;Ye-yeah. I kind of owe you for ruining the last one.&quot; Joel gave her a charming smile that made her heart melt.<br />
<br />
Zoey still wanted to go to the next show, but maybe she would let someone else volunteer this time.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
Jenny:<br />
<br />
Attending high-school again was a drag, especially after visiting her sister and being apart of such an amazing show. She hoped that she could hang with Nate some before the next show. She always wanted a brother back when she was Jimmy. It wasn&#39;t exactly the same now that she was the little sister but she still wanted to explore the dynamic.<br />
<br />
Jenny surveyed her new class. All of them remembered her being apart of this class, and being a 16 year old girl. That caused her to receive attention she wasn&#39;t exactly comfortable with. On one hand she was an adult recently, on the other her body and mind was now a teenager. Was she allowed to date?<br />
<br />
She mentioned it to Nate before heading home and he told her to give it a try. As a parting gift he used the chronovac to make her bi, so she could have a choice of dating girls like she was used to or exploring the possibility of dating guys. Jenny wasn&#39;t sure which she preferred but she was excited for what the future held.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
Nate and Andy<br />
<br />
&quot;You ended the show early.&quot; Andy sulked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the one who said to always leave them wanting more.&quot; Nate argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you need a grand finalé and the assistant&#39;s revenge isn&#39;t exactly the best show stopper.&quot; She countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they liked it. Besides, you can use the tricks we didn&#39;t next time you take the lead. I&#39;m kind of thinking with the title &#39;Notorious&#39; my show should have a bit of a different tone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are planning on turning me back at the end of the next show.&quot; Andy asked eagerly. <br />
<br />
Nate smirked. &quot;Maybe. Nothing says we have to trade off every show, we become too predictable if we did that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy fumed. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you had Jenny hide the chronovac from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t have you turning back before the show. I&#39;d like to make some unofficial appearances like this before we schedule the next show. Besides, who turned me into a mannequin and played with my plastic boobs without asking first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; Andy mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then consider this a bit of payback. Anyways, I had another reason for surprising you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; She asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you were so caught up about being old originally, you weren&#39;t really enjoying being 22 again. You were so cute, but wouldn&#39;t make a move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you wanted me to make a move!&quot; Andy shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? The flirting, me switching out my evening dress for a sexy leotard, the innuendos I made during rehearsal? None of that got through to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s face flushed as she looked down in silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I didn&#39;t do something, we&#39;d still be doing a stupid dance instead of in bed naked right now.&quot; Nate glanced at the lovely pair of breasts that were on display. &quot;Though I will say I understand your temptation to play with my boobs now.&quot; He smiled. <br />
<br />
Nate began to count on his fingers. &quot;So we discussed why I did it, we discussed Vanessa playing second assistant, we discussed you being lead assistant and getting to have everyone watch as you experience the transformation tricks you love so much.&quot; His hands reached underneath the sheets and felt between her legs. &quot;That got you excited, and we were interrupted. Is there anything else you wish to discuss before we go for the next round?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy gave a chagrin smile. &quot;Find. Round three it is.&quot; She said leaning back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Round five, but who&#39;s counting?&quot; Nate corrected as leaned in for a kiss. <br />
<br />
The End?</p>
