<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Chad hopped up onto the exam table, Todd explained his plan.<br />
<br />
“You see,” Todd said, turning his back on Chad and gathering instruments. Chad knew this would be his opportunity to fight back for what Todd had done to him, but the dog was in control and wouldn’t dream of harming his master. “When the monoxide leak killed off our studs, I knew I had to do something. I had been working on something for a while, but never had any practical application for it, and thus, no need to expedite its completion. The leak changed that. As you can guess, the ‘something’ I had been working on was the collar you are wearing right now. I finished it within days of the leak. My father had no idea I was working on such a thing. I knew it had to be tested, and I really had no other choice, so I programmed the species of dog into my computer, synched up the collar, and put it on.”<br />
<br />
Todd turned around and chuckled. Chad had sat back on his haunches, and with all of the pheromones drifting around, his dick was completely exposed.<br />
“Good boy Chad! I can see you’re ready to go! We’re going to do a quick sperm sample to make sure you’re not sterile, a few other tests to make sure you’re healthy, then we’re off to work.” Todd walked over to the table, “Stand boy” Chad stood, his erection waving around. Todd placed a metal container on the table. “Don’t worry, I’ll collect as much of your doggy juice as possible, but first I need both hands.” With that, Chad felt one hand cup his balls and another grasp his erect cock.<br />
<br />
“As I was changing I ran to my father to explain my plan. I could stand in for the studs! He didn’t believe me at first, of course, but as he watched his only son transform into an award winning Doberman stud, his skepticism waned. He agreed to the plan, but said there was one thing he needed to check. He walked me out here and milked me, much the same way I’m milking you. Had to check, ya know? Anyway, my results came back positive! I was ready to impregnate the bitches! But then, my father reached over and took the collar off of me. I changed back into a human right there. I asked him what the deal was, and he told me that 24 bitches was too much for just one stud. We would need a second. He stripped right there and put the collar on himself. Let me tell you, it was a strange sight watching my father transform into a Doberman. Anyway, it wasn’t long before all the bitches had him hard, so I milked him like he had milked me. His results came back positive, but the sperm count was much lower than mine. I took the collar off and watched as my father changed back. We figured the low count was most likely due to his age. And we would need someone to take the collars off after the job was done. The only solution was to find a stud around my age. That’s where you come in Chad! You and I are going to knock those bitches up!”<br />
Todd’s grip had tightened and Chad was starting to leak. His pre-cum was pooling in the metal container below him.<br />
<br />
“It took me a while to make another collar. Meanwhile, even though he wasn’t breeding material my father still enjoyed being a dog. We programmed another breed though. You know my new pet boxer Blitz I said I rescued from the pound? That’s actually my dad. He loves it! Especially going for walks and going to the dog park. He’s gone days without me changing him back he loves it so much. I’m sure you will too. Oops, looks like your knot is pretty inflated. You’re pretty close, aren’t ya boy? Okay, just let me get the container and...”<br />
Todd trailed off as his jerking motion increased. Chad had only half paid attention to Todd’s story as he was receiving the hand job, and now he hardly focus on anything. With a howl, Chad let loose in a torrent of doggy jizz right into the container. Todd kept stroking even after Chad’s orgasm had subsided. <br />
<br />
“Good boy! Look at all this doggy juice! You and I will have those bitches pregnant in no time! Oh look, you got some on my hand. Mind licking it off of your master boy?” At the word “master” Chad’s ears perked up and his tongue lolled out of his mouth. Todd held his jizz covered hand in front of his friend’s snout, and Chad eagerly licked it off. “That was just to get you used to your own jizz boy. You’ll find that you’re much more flexible now. Your should be able to get your nose all the way back to your nuts, and your tongue is much more... dexterous. That’ll come in handy since we’re cleaning ourselves between bitches.” Todd turned and looked Chad in the eye, “...and for other things.” He said with a smile. “You give it a shot while I get your sample tested. Then we’ll get a weight on you and we should be good to go!”<br />
<br />
An hour later the results were back. “Damn Chad! Your count is higher than mine! I guess I shouldn’t be surprised though. You were more of a stud than me as a guy, makes sense you are as a dog too.” Todd began to strip his clothing off. Once naked, Todd stored his clothing in a cabinet and removed a collar much like the one Chad was wearing. Todd filled up a glass of water and swallowed a pill before turning back to acknowledge Chad. <br />
<br />
“Alright boy! Let me show you to your new home for the next week to week and a half.  It shouldn’t take the two of us long to get these bitches impregnated, but father wants to make sure. Once he’s positive they’re all knocked up, off go to collars and you’ll be your normal self again!” Todd stopped at the first of two empty kennels. “In ya go boy! Welcome home!” Chad trotted into the kennel, door swinging closed and locking behind him. The dog part of him was altogether too happy to oblige his master. Todd walked to the second kennel, collar still in hand. He walked in and locked himself in. Todd turned to Chad as he fastened the collar around his neck. “And don’t worry Chad, once I’m a dog too that ‘master’ thing should wear off, and then we’ll be equals. Or maybe you’ll be my alpha, who knows. I’ve never been a dog around another male dog. Anyway, that was a sleeping pill I took so I’ll just sleep right through the changes.” Todd approached the fence separating them. “By morning we’ll be ready to fuck all of the bitches here boy! You excited for that?” Todd glanced at Chad’s hindquarters and could see that, yes, Chad was excited. Todd held his hand next to the fence. Chad stuck his muzzle through the chain link and gave Chad’s hand a lick. “Good boy Chad. Good boy.” Todd said. He walked to a corner and sat down in a bed of straw and blankets. Todd curled up and quickly went to sleep, even as brown fur was slowly poking out of his skin.</p>
