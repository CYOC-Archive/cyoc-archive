<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The amulet skipped and bounced from one hand to another as people in the audience tried to grab for the bobble.<br />
<br />
Bud Swanson having played shortstop in little league made the grab and held on to the bright gem stone. Quickly tucking it against his chest he cupped his hands about the prize. A twist and shove pushed away those others around him who would grab for what he'd caught.<br />
<br />
As the audience broke into a round of congratulary applause Bud ducked down and ran up the main isle for the doors.<br />
<br />
Out into the night with his prize he ran. Jumping into a cab he sat there and as it drove away he eyed his bright prize. High hopes, the longing desires on a young man for having what he never thought he'd own. All now seemed in his grasp as the cab headed him for his apartment.<br />
<br />
Bud had gone to the theater that night alone after one of many arguements between him and Angie, his wife.<br />
<br />
Angie was one lusting female and often begged Bud to get one of those penis enlargement kits. Her's was a wish for the most raw of sensual performance by her man. Bud was good in bed but not having the stamina his dearest' would prefer.<br />
<br />
The cab came up to stop at a red light, Bud sat up and looked out the cab's window. There at the same light was a carriage drawn by two large white horses. He might not have even given the carriage a second thought had it not been for the large gelding standing just inches from his cab's window.<br />
<br />
Who can say why at that moment when the cab pulled along side and stopped, but the big gelding let his monster cock fall out erect.<br />
<br />
The sheer mass of the horses erection took Bud by surprise. As they waited the light's change to green the horse began to lift his massive organ, bumping it into his rounded hairy belly. Bud watched with such facination he actually ordered the cab driver to remain there for him to see the horse masturbate.<br />
<br />
A minute later Bud was out of the cab and face down in the street.<br />
<br />
Tossed from the cab by it's driver the man called Bud a pervert and ejected him from the cab. Now looking up Bud had a worm's eye view of the masturbation in progress. Even though the gelding had no way to finalize his action with a spewing of his seed, he was remarkable to watch.<br />
<br />
Bud got to his hands and knees, then stood up as the gelding let loose a gusher of urine into the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;You liked the show?&quot; came a question poised by the carriage driver.<br />
<br />
Bud stood there saying nothing as the carriage slowly went on its way back to the Park for yet another ride for lovers to cuddle.<br />
<br />
Now Bud started walking, his apartment being not far away. As he walked he thought of what he'd just seen and then of Angie and what she wished he was and could someday do for her.<br />
<br />
As fingers rubbed the amulet his thoughts moved from fond thinking to an actual wish for his maleness to be as large and lusty as a stallion horse.<br />
<br />
Deep in his pocket the amulet heeded now to Bud's wishing desires. Unseen Bud walked un but the amulet was working its magic.<br />
<br />
Reaching his apartment building he was having pangs for the need to relieve himself before he could get the elevator. Looking for a perfect place to release a flow he walked under a flight of steps and unzipped.<br />
<br />
A sensual moan came from Bud's lips as fingers reached into his jockey shorts pulling out the soft folds of an equine sheath. Dark as it was there remained enough dim light for Bud to see what he now had to mark him as a male.<br />
<br />
Fold after soft fold of thick skin with long feeler hairs tickling his fancy. As fingers tantilized his mind with wild new senuality the impossible became possible.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his male part began to explode out in size, length, and bold black color. It strained at his fingers spreading them apart and growing first a foot long. Then as if it was growing the monster member grew longer and longer passing maybe twenty inches in length. It strained to gather itself taunt and hard as the head flared out domed but black as sin.<br />
<br />
It was the release of a bladder which made him moan a satified groan. He found himself quite pleasurable as fingers and hands gripped his most wonderous delight.<br />
<br />
Erect yet he turned toward the light beaming down from a nearby streetlamp. The realization of his maleness now being simular to the horse he'd seen not an hour before. Although not a huge as that draft horse had for a cock, his was as long and the same shape and color to boot!<br />
<br />
Now he thought of angie and her wish for him to be more of a man where it counted. He licked his lips with the intent for her to feel him ram this tool home. A hard stuffing of his long cock down the pant leg of his trousers proved difficult but with some labor it was forced inside.<br />
<br />
Up the elevator he went thinking of how Angie was going to bend to his massive will, now. He planned of a night in bed doing what was now so sensual a thing for him and her. His desire was building and with it a new erection forced to remain shoved downward in a pant leg.<br />
<br />
Walking with a strange limping he left the elevator and walked down the hallway to his apartment's front door. He smiled thinking of how she and he had fought before that night. It was Bud who paid royally for the theater tickets and when Angie wouldn't go, he went alone.<br />
<br />
Now he was returning to grant her a wild night of sensual pleasure. <br />
<br />
The key turned in the door lock and as he opened it the sounds of Angie's most sensual moanings touched his ears. <br />
<br />
In an instant he was inside and walking down the hall toward their bedroom. As he got closer Angie's moaning was even louder and mixed with the tender words of some other man.<br />
<br />
Anger, and rage filled Bud's chest as he wanted in the worst way to burst in on her and this vile wife stealing man. His erection that impaired his walking hung now limp down the pant leg. His rathe was comsuming the sexual lust leaving him poised and ready to kill.<br />
<br />
Grumbling to himself Bud thought of Angie spread out over their bed and some other man's maleness rammed in where only Bud's belonged. He wanted to show her who was the stud and beat the intruder away from what was his property, his wife!<br />
<br />
Thinking to himself of his new tool and the power that made it all possible Bud began to bring out a wish. Muttering his thoughts aloud  as he stood outside the bedroom's door the two lover's inside heard  a voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I did to be as a stallion for her, only to come home and find her mated to another! I be the stallion here and she is my property and my mare. Wished I did to have a cock of cock's and all for what? Damn her and him who does her now, they are swine! Angie you fucking whore your nothing but a sow! I wish to hell you were a mare for me to fuck and me a stallion to show you what a good time really is!&quot; grumbled aloud Bud as he stood in the hall.<br />
<br />
Angie's moans turned to screams and then whinnies as she changed under the powers of the amulet. Bud too was changing in quick order becoming as a stallion in form from head to hoof. It was as his changed finished and angie' stood still with a human face attached to a mare's form and body, a stallion took to mounting his mare.<br />
<br />
Naked a young man stood in the corner of the apartment bedroom watching what had to be something unbelievible to all there. Bud stood as a draft horse white stud and humped over Angie's now broad hairy back. His large cock thrust in and out making the mare moan with her wildest passions tantilized.<br />
<br />
Angie a dappled gray Percheron mare looked back over her flanks at the husband now ever so worthy to keep her satisfied.<br />
<br />
Bill stood in the dark corner seeing the magic happen and then eyeing an amulet laying on the carpet. reaching down he picked it up and felt the waves of power surging within the gem.<br />
<br />
Clothes in hand Bill got dressed and waited for stallion and mare to tire of their mutual delights.<br />
<br />
As Bud dropped down and pulled his maleness from Angie's now red hot  lips of equine sex he stood panting like a tired dog. The passion play now over both Angie and Bud had a sudden mutual rational understanding. As one looked to the other they both realized their lives as being human was now past. A stallion and his mare both as Percheron horses their's was to be a life of beastly burdens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you two are done and now ready I suggest we all take the frieght elevator to the main floor and make our leave of this place!&quot; said Bill.<br />
<br />
Bud being both a stallion and an enraged husband saw this the homewrecker still human as he was a common animal. Reaching out his powerful jaws he strained to snap at Bill's shoulder.<br />
<br />
A jump backwards had Bill wishing that Bud was to be a nice a friendly stallion, and it came to pass with the amulet's soft glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you both to become just plain nice and friendly, willing working horses!&quot; said Bill as again the amulet glowed a soft flicker.<br />
<br />
Now two friendly large animals stood awaiting their master's wishes. A prize catch for Bill as he later that night sold both handsome animals to the Park Street Carriage House.<br />
<br />
The amulet belonged to Bill and he was having some sensual thoughts.</p>
