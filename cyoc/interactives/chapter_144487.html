<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a few moments for Alex to steady himself, shaking his head to clear out the headiness. Alex felt the strange wasted feeling fall off as he got his head clear. Soon, the myriad of colors the trails left began to solidify and converge into a focused, thick trail.<br />
<br />
“Okay… I think I got the hang of it.” Alex walked and followed the trail, stumbling ever so slightly on his muscular legs. Like a hangover, he had to periodically support himself on the walls whenever he made a turn. <br />
<br />
Sam, of course noticed this new ability’s debilitating effect. You yourself had to watch over Alex, worrying about his apparently new ability. <br />
<br />
“That’s odd…” Sam cupped her hands to her chin, thinking. “I got my own ability mastered already, I think, and I don’t have any side effects.” <br />
<br />
You give a questioning hiss, Jessie and Sam looking to you. Sam suddenly disappeared from your side, eliciting a hiss of surprise from you and a shocked yelp from Jessie while Alex continued on without a care.<br />
<br />
“I’m still here, and I’m just as fine.” Sam suddenly returned to the visible spectrum, perplexed. “Huh, even your clothing turns invisible?” <br />
<br />
Sam agreed, curious as to how her latex born ability affected also her clothing, which was not part of the latex. <br />
<br />
“The brown path is getting thicker, <i>fresher</i>.” You turn your sight to Alex’s sudden claim, putting aside the question about their abilities. Your own ability, the light, seemed trivial and had no side effects either. Maybe it was the mental strain?<br />
<br />
“Right!” Jessie walked to the front of the group with a steeled determination, willing to be the first to meet Tyson. <br />
<br />
As per planned, you and your latex-bound friends walked slower, Alex whispering directions for Jessie to follow. Turn by turn, hallway by hallway, no latex creatures seemed to be in sight. However that was not true. Through their enhanced hearing, they could hear the latex’s squeaking through the doors, and they, do not need to go into the doors.<br />
<br />
“Ugh! This headache is making me sick…” Sam scoffed. Alex turned towards her, his eyes briefly filled with primal instinct. “That’s just a hangover.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… right.” Alex focused on the trail again, finding that it now seemed too thick and very much <i>alive</i>.<br />
<br />
“He’s right by-” He was cut off by Jessie suddenly freezing upon turning right, eyes wide and her body stiff. “You found him?” <br />
<br />
“Y... Yeah...” She seemed to falter, scared shitless. The group peered over the corner, seeing a massive, much bigger than Alex by a margin, brown latex eagle. Tyson, or whatever currently controlled him walked slowly,  guffawing and dumbly chuckling and completely oblivious to his stalkers.<br />
<br />
All of you back off, giving Jessie a wide berth and grunts of encouragement. She nodded, walking forwards and releasing a held breath.<br />
<br />
“Hey… .Tyson…” She tried to keep a smile although strained, she persevered. “I’m here!”<br />
<br />
The lumbering idiot turned towards her, eliciting a smile filled with relief as he appeared to recognize her.<br />
<br />
“HUUHUH!” Tyson grinned a stupid, dumb grin and turned. Jessie’s face fell entirely into fear. She had just witnessed the big sausage and eggs Tyson now sported, and she felt revulsion.<br />
<br />
“Jess...ieee.” <em>The</em> Jock Eagle, a name Jessie had subconsciously tagged him with, moaned. “<i>Fuuuuuuuuuuck</i>...”<br />
<br />
It was sudden, but a glint in Jock Eagle’s eyes was all the warning she ever got when he suddenly lunged, all the mass and muscle and the package down there suddenly flying towards her, his wings splayed out to grant more range. She just couldn’t hold back the meek shout as she metaphorically shat her pants.<br />
<br />
It was a near smothering when Alex suddenly intercepted him, ramming himself into Tyson and forcing them both to veer off course. Jessie jumped, running away towards you as Alex wrestled it out with Tyson. The grunts and squeaks was making you aroused, but you stay put as Sam joined the fray, jumping and slamming her taloned feet into Tyson’s face. <br />
<br />
Alex seemed to be able to get Tyson in a bearhug from the back and Sam was able to hold him down from the front, ignoring the big dick slicking into her own slit as she moaned. She held her ground, unwilling to waver. “Dude! Chill!” <br />
<br />
Alex growled, struggling against this particularly defiant prey. However, before their very eyes, Tyson seemed to <i>grow</i>.<br />
<br />
“Wh-” was all Alex could say as he was flung with so much force he cracked his head on the wall, immediately falling into unconsciousness. Sam found herself briefly and deeply penetrated, before the dick roughly pulled out and she found herself flung by a rubbery yet feathered muscular arm, cracking her head as well.<br />
<br />
All that’s left was you along with Jessie, against this growing monstrosity. <br />
<br />
And you. <br />
<br />
Feel. <br />
<br />
<i><b>Angry</b></i>.<br />
<br />
Tyson, now a massive behemoth easily two times bigger than Alex, lunged at Jessie who didn’t really get to you. She screamed, this time truly with helpless fear.<br />
<br />
Something took over. You don’t know where you started and where you ended. It all felt like a blur as you found yourself, somehow staring down at this prey. This <i>insolent prey</i> that <i>dared</i> hurt <i>your</i> spawns. You hiss a menacing hiss, this prey struggling in your coils as light shone bright. You don’t know what it does, but you know what it does. This prey fell to your power, its dominance diminishing as its muscles shrunk. You grinned, tightening your coils around this prey until it screamed.<br />
<br />
You won’t let it go, smacking the <i>pesky human pest</i> away, her screams silenced as she was flung away. You are going to <i>savour</i> this.<br />
<br />
Now fully shrunk to the size of your first spawn, you gaze into this prey’s fearful eyes. Seeing him struggle made <i>you</i> hard. Your cocks engorge themselves and you bring your body to the top of the coils, presenting this prey with your magnificence. Your coils tighten, causing him to scream in silence as you slowly, but surely insert both of your rods deep into this glorious hole you found.<br />
<br />
Slowly, you push, tightening your coils and loosening it to force the prey to breathe in, forced to swallow your rods deeper. You yourself pushed in and out, in rhythm with your coils. “<i>This feels good!</i>”<br />
<br />
The doubled stimulation to both of your dicks made you unable to edge, torrents of your royal jelly streaming into the awaiting maw of this prey, to be made your <i>spawn</i>. <br />
<br />
You squeeze, forcing this prey to swallow, some of if dribbling out of his beak. You slap him for his insolence, forcing your dicks deeper. “<i>None of my essence is left out!</i>.”<br />
<br />
Soon, you finish, letting go of your new spawn, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and unceremoniously flopping to the floor, unconscious and fully bloated.<br />
<br />
You turn towards Jessie, the now awake Alex and Sam, and realization set in. Their looks of fear seemed to confuse you. Didn’t <i>you</i> give <i>them</i> what <i>they</i> wanted? Your essence will bring back this Tyson being as <i>your spawn</i>. They should be praising <i>him</i>.<br />
<br />
Him…<br />
<br />
Who was he?<br />
<br />
Isn’t it easy? He’s the snake. The king!<br />
<br />
Isn’t it?<br />
<br />
Isn’t he…<i>Martin</i>?<br />
<br />
Suddenly jolting awake, Martin looked to his spent dicks, to his dying light and the fear etched on each of their faces. Memories replayed themselves, to him, thinking about himself… to his actions.<br />
<br />
“<i>What have I done?</i>”</p>
