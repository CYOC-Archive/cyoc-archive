<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The set-up seemed perfect. Ty was reaching into his jacket, made the two pocket-dicks <br />
invisible for everyone in the room except for himself and took them out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, boys,&quot; he whispered, &quot;ready to go!&quot; He blinked with his eyes - another methode <br />
to mark the start of his wish, because snipping might have been a bit too obvious in <br />
a place like this - and from now on he could order those pocket-dicks directly via  <br />
mind-controle. (Which again raises the question, whether those dicks actually had a <br />
mind to controle?) <br />
<br />
Ty sent the two pocket-dicks over to the man who was reading a newspaper. He watched <br />
them run over to the table, jumping on the man&#39;s feet and then onto each of his <br />
knees and then onto the table. The man jumped a bit as he felt that there was something <br />
on his knee, but he could see absolutely nothing, and obviously irritated he turned back to <br />
his newspaper. <br />
<br />
The two pocket-dicks were now sitting on that man&#39;s table. Ty blinked and made it so <br />
that they would also be visible to that man but for no one else escept for Ty. He just had <br />
to wait for that man to lower his newspaper once again in order to let the fun begin. <br />
It took a while for that to happen. There seemed to be an article he took quite an inteest <br />
in apparently.When he finally did lower his paper, there were two penisses sitting right <br />
in front of him. They were not hard, but semi limb and as he was watching them in obvious <br />
disbelief, they were moving their heads as if they were nodding at him. <br />
<br />
The look on his face was priceless. Ty had to watch out that he was not laughing out loud. <br />
The man&#39;s reading glasses that had already been sitting at the very tip of his nose was slowly <br />
slipping down as he himself seemed as he was frozen. At that moment the waitress appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something else for you?&quot; she was asking, whilst picking up his empty cup. <br />
<br />
That was when he came to his senses again. He pushed his glasses up his nose and turned <br />
to the waitress. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything else for you? We have lovely chocolate cake today. Or would you like to try <br />
our Black Forest Gateau?&quot;<br />
<br />
As she was talking to him, the two dicks were still on the table, taking turns in jumping up and <br />
down right in front of him. The waitress reached out to the sugar dispenser and placed it right <br />
between the two jumping dicks without seeing them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me sir, but are you feeling all right? You are looking quite pale.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man was staring at the two jumping dicks. &quot;No, ... ahem ... yes, no, thank you. I am fine. <br />
Ahem, ... I might not feel so well after all ... could you get me a double expresso if you please?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure!&quot; the waitress replied and by saying that left. <br />
<br />
The man was staring at the dicks again, took his glasses off, rubbed his eyes, put his glasses <br />
on again. He took up his newspaper and tried to focus on it, but it obviously did not work. <br />
He then put it completely down again. The two dics were still there. They were now completely <br />
stiff, rubbing each others heads, when the waitress reappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go Sir.&quot; She placed a cup of espresso onto the table, right next to the dicks that were <br />
rubbing each other. The man hurriedly picked up the cup, &quot;Thank you Miss!&quot; and with a frown <br />
the waitress left again. The man held his cup with both hands, closed his eyes and tried to calm <br />
himself down by taking deep and slow breaths. He then opened his eyes again. The dicks were <br />
still there, this time playing hide and seek behind the menu and the sugar caster. He took a sip <br />
of his expresso and took a peek at the other customers. The elderly ladies in the back were still <br />
chatting, the student still reading and the mother and her child were still occupied with their <br />
chocolate and cake. Ty was stirring his cappuccino and facing the other direction, trying to appear <br />
as if he was watching the waitress. (&quot;She did look kinda cute. Maybe a student who was earning <br />
some money for college?&quot;) <br />
<br />
No one seemed to take notice of those two dicks that were running and jumping on the table. <br />
That had been running on his table, to be precise, because now they were jumping down again, <br />
first on his knee, then down to the floor and when they had gone that far they were attacking his <br />
ankle. As stiff as they were and since they had already been rubbing against each other before <br />
it only took a short moment for them to ejaculate on his shoe and trousers. The man jumped, but <br />
it was too late, his shoe and trousers were full of goo. But when he looked down again there was <br />
nothing. No dicks, no goo, nothing. But everyone in the room was now looking at him, wondering <br />
about what had gotten into him. He jumped up, threw some money on the table and left in horror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wonder what has gotten into him?&quot; the barrista said to the waitress.</p>
