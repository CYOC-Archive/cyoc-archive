<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex couldn&#39;t help but feel strange walking along the road through all this farmland. The farms were small and close together as you&#39;d expect from a land without much in the way of farm technology, but it still seemed normal at first glance. That was until one looked closer.<br />
<br />
Having only really met Roc and Raf so far, he didn&#39;t know what to think about the fact they had never heard of women, but as he walked he saw plenty of people, other travelers, people working on the farm, and all of them where boys or men. It was hard to tell with some of the young children, but with the teens and the adults it was unmistakable. While some seemed to run the gamut of body types, a lot of the people he saw were farmers used to manual labor so many were fit or at least in good shape.<br />
<br />
The other oddity was the way people dressed. Like how Alex himself was dressed, most people only seemed to wear clothing below the waist, though there was a wide variety of what people were wearing, probably to do with personal taste more than anything. Loin cloths and kilts seemed as popular as shorts and pants. There were some who wore things on their torso, but they didn&#39;t really qualify as clothing. Suspenders to keep up pants, harnesses that seemed to serve as more decorative suspenders, and sometimes a vest which he saw on wealthier looking travelers, but those vests were small things and barely covered anything, often short and always left open, they seemed more a way to show off expensive embroidery than anything else.<br />
<br />
People were in family groups, too. Couples that were both men with children around. Children that looked like a combination of their parents. Alex even swore he saw one or two men with overly distended bellies that did not match the rest of their bodies. He settled his mind when he saw one man with the lean build of a runner and a large swollen belly. Those men were pregnant, Alex was sure of it. Alex wasn&#39;t sure if his body had changed enough coming here for that to happen to him, but he wasn&#39;t eager to find out at the moment.<br />
<br />
Eventually the sun kept creeping closer to the horizon and all Alex could see spread out in front of him was more farm land. No sign of a town in the distance. He slowed as he noticed one farmer working at repairing a bit of fencing at the front of his property. He was a beefy man, heavily muscled with a layer of padding making him appear even thicker, it hid definition but not the size of his muscles, his arms and chest bulged as he pounded fence posts into the ground with a mallet. His exposed chest and stomach was covered with a layer of thick curly hair, one black but now salt and peppered, as was the thick beard he wore. Alex guessed he was somewhere in his mid-forties. The house in the back had smoke rising from the chimney and Alex felt like he could smell something cooking on the air.<br />
<br />
So engrossed by the farmer, Alex barely noticed the teenager nearby. Probably about fourteen, he looked like the man, though much younger with the gangly awkward build of a teen in the middle of a growth spurt. He was digging post holes ahead of where his father was pounding them in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; Alex figured politeness was best in this situation, or any situation.&quot;How much further is it to Dicktin?&quot;<br />
<br />
The farmer looked up, his eyes scanning Alex as if appraising him. With the simple clothing he wore, his new somewhat more muscular physique, and covered in the dust of the road, he must look like a country farm youth himself. Maybe one just into adulthood and off to see the world before taking over the family farm. Whatever he saw, the farmer smiled leisurely at Alex, seemingly not bothered by random strangers talking to him. &quot;By foot? Another eight hours if you don&#39;t stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked up the road and turned to the farmer. &quot;My name&#39;s Alex an..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And,&quot; The farmer interrupted, &quot;You don&#39;t have much money, but if I put you up for the night you&#39;ll help out with some chores around the farm.&quot; He laughed, which was a rich, booming sound. &quot;Don&#39;t look so shocked, you&#39;re not the first young man to come to my farm while walking this road.&quot; A few feet away, the teen was suddenly looking eager as if he saw his way out of digging holes.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name&#39;s Rick. This is my younger son Van.&quot; The teen gave Alex a slight wave. &quot;Van, take Alex here around back, he can help Bo split logs. Don&#39;t give me that look, you know why you&#39;re on hole digging duty.&quot; Van had opened his mouth to say something but instead just motioned Alex to follow him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; Alex said to Rick before following after Van, who had run ahead. Still Alex didn&#39;t have much trouble following him, especially once he heard the steady ker-chunk noise of an ax digging into wood. He rounded the corner behind the farm house, to see the older brother, Bo, hefting the ax on his shoulder as he listened to Van.<br />
<br />
Where Van kind of looked like Rick, Bo looked like a version of Rick with a little more than twenty years shaved off of him. Probably 18 or 19 years old, he was a small mountain of muscle. Getting closer, Alex saw that Bo might actually be taller than Rick, mentally placing him somewhere at the six and a half foot mark. He didn&#39;t have the smooth, sculpted muscles of a gymrat, but rather the heavy, sturdy build of a manual laborer, and without his father&#39;s padding that no doubt came with age. He had only a light dusting of dark hair along his rounded pectorals and rigid stomach, though it probably would grow in thicker as he aged, Bo was still obviously young despite his size. The raven black  hair on his head was cropped short and he was starting some sparse attempt at a beard that was still probably better than what Alex could grow. He wore a baggy pair of pants, tucked into boots and held up by a pair of suspenders, the rest of his bare flash glistened with sweat. Alex felt himself instantly getting hard inside his shorts, and blushed a little when he remembered those shorts wouldn&#39;t do much to hide it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it, go back and help Paw before he thinks you&#39;re dawdling.&quot; Bo&#39;s voice was as deep as Rick&#39;s though less gruff, it was actually almost soft. Still, it made Van jump and hurry off. When Bo looked at Alex, he felt like he was being sized up again, though in a very different way. &quot;Comfortable chopping wood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head. &quot;I&#39;ve never done it before, but I&#39;m willing to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer got a funny look from Bo, &quot;Never chopped.. I&#39;ll work the ax then, you can do the running.&quot; He pointed at a pile of rough logs, then a smaller pile next to him. &quot;Bring me the unchopped logs and set them in this pile.&quot; He pointed at another pile of split logs next to him. &quot;And take the split logs and stack them neatly over there.&quot; He pointed a a pile of split logs the nestled up against the side of the farm house. &quot;Fair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair.&quot; Alex agreed, he found an out of the way place to put his bag of meager possessions, and started in on the job Bo asked of him. They didn&#39;t speak, except for once or twice when Bo had to correct him in the way he was doing something, but he made sure he didn&#39;t repeat the mistakes. It was heavier work than Alex was used to doing, and it strained his new muscles. Shortly, he was covered in his own sheen of sweat. Sometimes there would be a pause in the steady beat of ax on wood and Alex would look over to see Bo watching him, though when noticed he&#39;d quickly look away and get back to work. Within thirty minutes they had a steady rhythm going, and as the sun set and moves into twilight they were working together in perfect sync. As the last light started to fade a couple hours later, Bo picked up the last of the split logs and helped Alex add them to the stack.<br />
<br />
Stepping back, he let out a whistle. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t need to split logs for a couple months. You did good work.&quot; Alex almost stumbled as Bo clapped him on the back, then blushed as he left his hand there, though looked up at the sky. &quot;We got a bit, but we should go get washed up before dinner. Follow me.&quot; He winked, and instead of heading to the farmhouse he headed off towards the tree line at the back of the farm. Just beyond was a spring that fed a clear pool of crisp, clear-looking water. Night chill hadn&#39;t yet set in, and Alex was so warm from his hours of manual labor, that pool looked particularly inviting.<br />
<br />
Bo was already sitting on the bank to tug off his boots which he set aside, then slipped the suspenders holding up his pants off his shoulders and let them fall to the ground. Alex&#39;s eyes practically bugged out of his face. Bo was hung like a proverbial horse, it wasn&#39;t even hard and his cock must have hung a good nine inches down, with a pair of large heavy balls to match. No wonder his pants had been baggy, anything else would have failed to hide that massive bulge. He noticed Alex staring and laughed. &quot;What? Never seen a dick before?&quot; The comment was meant to be teasing, of course, but Bo slipped into the water, submerging himself for a moment before coming up for air. &quot;Coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question snapped Alex out of his day dream. He had suddenly been thinking of wrapping his hands around that massive piece of meat. But he followed suit, stripping off his boots and shorts, revealing his much smaller, leaner physique. Not to mention plainly average cock. He slipped into the cool water, feeling almost instantly refreshed as soon as it flowed along his skin, cleaning off the drying sweat. Bo was cleaning off by scrubbing himself with handfuls of sand from the pond bottom, and Alex followed suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad work for a city boy.&quot; Bo finally spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;City?&quot; Alex asked, looking over to Bo, watching the muscles in his back shift beneath his skin as he scrubbed clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figure it&#39;s the only reason you don&#39;t know how to chop wood. Must be from a city. Heading to Dicktin, so from somewhere west of here. I&#39;m betting one of the fishing towns on the other side of the woods. But city means the biggest of them, so Roundbottom Port, am I right?&quot; Bo was smiling as he turned around to face Alex.<br />
<br />
Alex couldn&#39;t really explain where he came from, but he listened carefully to Bo&#39;s guess, as it would make a good a story to tell anyone who asked as anything else. So he nodded. &quot;Pretty good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bo grinned, clearly pleased with himself. &quot;I want to travel someday. See some of the cities and towns in the Kingdom before I settle down to get married and take over the farm. Kind of what you&#39;re doing, I&#39;m guessing?&quot; Bo had moved closer to Alex and was now standing just a few inches from him. Alex had to look up to see Bo&#39;s face since he just over half a foot taller than himself. Then he felt those lips pressed against his lips. Strong, calloused hands at his waist. Then there was a bell.<br />
<br />
The bell caused Bo to break off the kiss, with an almost too cheery. &quot;Dinner&#39;s ready.&quot; He climbed back on shore, and Alex followed. But this time Bo was sporting a full erection as well, which must have been a foot of rigid, throbbing cock. But he didn&#39;t get dressed, and instead grabbed his clothes and started walking to the farmhouse. &quot;If you don&#39;t have a frash change, I have some clothes I outgrew that you can borrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
When they got to the house both Rick and Van were seated already, and washed up. Neither commented on both of them coming into the house completely naked and dripping wet, other than Rick to say, &quot;Saw the woodpile, good work.&quot; Bo led his to his room and lent him a pair of shorts, softer and a bit baggier than his other pair, but he pulled them on and cinched them tight with his belt before going to join the others for dinner.<br />
<br />
Heading back out of Bo&#39;s room, there was now another middle-aged man at the table, serving out stew into bowls. He was tall, same height as Bo, but lean unlike the bulky Rick, and only lightly hairy, though he wore a neat trimmed beard. &quot;Welcome Alex, I&#39;m Kirk.&quot; Some crusty bread was set on plates by the stew and the whole group got to eating. It was silent for the first few minutes as ravenous hungers took control, except the corner of the the table where Rick and Kirk were talking in hushed whispers.<br />
<br />
Finally, in a lull in the conversation between the two older men, Alex spoke up. &quot;Thank you again, the food&#39;s delicious and I really appreciate the place to sleep.&quot; Both men smiled, and the dinner eased into mild conversation. Bo&#39;s guess of a story coming in handy when he was asked questions. Though he had to add the fact that his fathers ran a fish market. It was the first thing he could come up with. Though he didn&#39;t lie when asked about sibling and stated he had an older, not that Alex expected to see them again unless he could get back home. Rick poured small cups of something that smelled like brandy for everyone but Van, who was sent off to bed, though with it being dark outside, the night cap lead to bed for the rest of them as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have a spare room, so Alex, you&#39;ll be spending the night in Bo&#39;s room.&quot; Rick said that with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure you get some sleep, you&#39;ll be helping Bo with his morning chores, then you have a long walk ahead of you if you want to make Dicktin.&quot; Kirk added with his own smile. As they went into one room, Bo led him back to his room. There was only one decent sized bed and a dresser. As soon as the door closed, Bo started stripping.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where will I be?&quot; Alex asked, which got an amused smirk from Bo.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bed&#39;s big enough for both of us.&quot; Bo moved closer and undid Alex&#39;s belt, pushing those shorts down and leaving Alex standing there naked. &quot;I was hoping we could finish what we started in the pond.&quot; He shoved Alex back on the bed.<br />
<br />
Alex stared up at Bo, and Bo&#39;s massive hard-on. His own cock had already responded in kind. &quot;And if your family hears?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bo just shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m an adult and unmarried, I&#39;m allowed to sleep around a bit.&quot; He stepped closer to the edge of the bed. It was tall enough that with Alex laying on it, Bo&#39;s cock laid right no Alex&#39;s stomach. Bo reached down and started fingering Alex&#39;s ass, those thick, rough digits already causing Alex to shiver in pleasure as they explored inside of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I want to try, I&#39;m not sure I can take you..&quot; Alex said, staring at the massive cock laying along his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one way to find out.&quot; Bo&#39;s grin as almost mischievous as he propped Alex&#39; ankles up on his shoulders and guided his cock to Alex&#39;s waiting hole.<br />
<br />
Alex had never felt such a mix of pleasure and pain as he did when the head of that cock slipped inside of him. The closest was when he was knotted by Roc. &quot;Well you can take the thickness.&quot; Bo said, sounding impressed, &quot;Now to see how deep you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bo was gentle as he slid inside, and every so often he&#39;d slide out a bit before pushing in deeper. Alex felt stuffed, it hurt at first, and then he quickly got comfortable with the feeling. In fact, having that huge cock pressed up against his g-spot was one of the best feelings he could remember. And if the sounds coming from Bo were any indication, he was enjoying it just as much. &quot;Damn.. no one&#39;s even taken this much before. You were being modest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shot Bo a grin, and the muscular young farmer started up a slow rhythmic thrusting. What surprised Alex was the tingle he suddenly felt. It was familiar but he had trouble placing it. Then it came back to him.. Roc.. along with Raf&#39;s warning about being careful the next few days. &quot;Shit, Bo, I need to warn you..&quot;<br />
<br />
Though he was cut off by Bo. &quot;Oh gods, that&#39;s hot.&quot; Bo was staring down at him, still thrusting, so Alex looked down at his own body. His muscles, already bigger from Roc&#39;s blessing, were swelling again. Not very much, but enough to be noticeable. More noticeable was his cock was definitely longer than it was before, by a good inch. And his one faint treasure trail was a bit more distinct.<br />
<br />
Alex was worried, but it actually seemed to be turning on Bo, who was now fucking him even harder, driving both of them towards climax. Alex gasped as he couldn&#39;t hold back any more and shot his load on his own chest. But then he felt Bo&#39;s seed fill him and the tingling went into overdrive. He quickly packed on what looked like fifteen more pounds of muscle on top of the five from Bo penetrating him, he was till well shy of Bo, but he looked like he had been working on the farm for a year rather than an afternoon. His cock, too, had grown another inch and was definitely thicker, which would put him at an above average eight inches if he guessed right. His chest hair and stomach hair was noticeably thicker. Where it had been a bit peach fuzzy before he had a distinct strip of dark hair down his torso and an inverted triangle of curly hair on his chest. Even the way he lay on the bed he could tell he might have added a couple inches in height. He was well short of Bo&#39;s mountainous stature, but the changes were noticeable. Maybe a third of the difference between their sizes added on to him in a matter of moments.<br />
<br />
Alex felt Bo slide out of him, and still in a daze fall onto the bed next to him. Alex opened his mouth to explain but Bo just put a finger over it. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s actually kind of sexy. Besides, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to have to explain this to Paw in the morning, I&#39;ll listen then. I&#39;m so tired right now I&#39;d forget anyway.&quot; Bo punctuated his own words with a yawn. &quot;Unless.. is it going to do something to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. It probably would have already if it was going to.&quot;  Bo nodded his head and cuddled up against Alex, pulling him in with his strong arms. Alex was stronger than ever before now, but Bo still had a good forty pounds of muscle on him. Not that Alex wanted to fight as they naturally fell into spooning on the bed, Bo happily being the big spoon.<br />
<br />
Alex was nudged awake by Bo just as the sky was starting to show the first signs of light. The subtle lightening of the sky before the sun was even up. They went to do the morning chores, which were less demanding physically. First to collect eggs, though the hens looked odd to Alex. Not that he had been around many chickens, then he realized it was a bevy of plump roosters with one larger rooster ruling over them. Same when they went to milk the dairy &#39;bulls&#39;. They weren&#39;t cows, they had udders but they also obviously had male parts as well down there. A quick peek behind them showed Alex the only addition was the udders. It was strange and surreal, but he was also occupied taking in Bo&#39;s lessons on how to milk one of them properly.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, when they got back breakfast was waiting for them, along with stares from the rest of Bo&#39;s family for Alex&#39;s enhanced form. He decided since it was something of this world to at least be truthful.. mostly. Instead of appearing in the woods naked, he was waylaid and all his things taken. From there he told the truth, Raf and Roc finding him, giving him a place to stay, and the wolf blessing. &quot;They said it was to help protect me as I traveled. They warned me to be careful who I, um.. I forgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slept with.&quot; Rick finished for Alex, though he didn&#39;t sound upset at all that him and Bo had shared the evening, in fact he seemed amused. &quot;I know the pair. Good sorts for werewolves. They keep their pack away from our flocks, and help keep the wild predators away, too. And usually keep the woods free of bandits.&quot; He nodded. &quot;Well, if it&#39;s something from them, it can&#39;t be bad. And I can&#39;t say the results haven&#39;t been good for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick reached into a bag on the table and placed a few heavy coppery coins next to Alex&#39;s plate. &quot;A days wages for a farmhand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to do that. Our agreement was food and a place to sleep.&quot; Alex tried to push the coins back but Rick pushed them back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense. You did good work, you didn&#39;t complain, and a farm hand gets room and board in addition to pay. It&#39;s only fair.&quot; Then Rick looked between him and Bo, and the thought this might be where the hammer falls and he&#39;s told to scoot on as quick as possible. &quot;I know you&#39;re eager to get on with your journey, but I can tell you&#39;re also strapped for cash. If you&#39;re willing, I&#39;ll pay you fair for your labor if you stick around and help with the chores a few more days. Dicktin is no place to go without money. Townfolk want money, not offers of free work.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was not the offer Alex had been expecting, he decided..</p>
