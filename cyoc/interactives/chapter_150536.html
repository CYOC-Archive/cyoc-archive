<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lily&#39;s Perspective:<br />
<br />
Lily sometimes felt as if she were the cling on of her friends. They were all rather dynamic or distinctly who they were, no matter who was around. She admired them all for their own reasons, Natasha&#39;s assertiveness, Naomi&#39;s energy, Eliza&#39;s intelligence, Eve&#39;s motherly nature, and even Marie&#39;s boldness. Here she was, just Lily... Nothing really special about her except maybe her overly nervous nature. She could barely look the magician in the eyes for two seconds without hiding her face. &quot;I hope I never have to lose my friends...&quot; It took everything she had to look at the magic woman and say that. As they left for home, Eve rested a reassuring hand on Lily&#39;s shoulder. Of all the things she could have wished for, it was not losing any of her friends.<br />
<br />
The next morning had gone as they all did, Eve, Eliza, and Naomi were waiting at the breakfast table when she&#39;d gotten up. Eve had trusted her with the task of waking up Marie for breakfast in the morning and she could do that for her. With a practiced stealth she slipped from her room into Marie&#39;s. Marie was very unabashed person, she slept on top of her sheets more than under them. Unfortunately never felt the need for pajamas... Once again Lily had found herself staring at the nude form of her roommate. Her blush rose to her cheeks with its own habit despite having seen Marie like this many times. Even in the shower... Lily had to be careful about remembering to lock the bathroom door or Marie would slip in with her. Reaching out, her nudged Marie&#39;s shoulder until she saw one eye looking in her direction. <br />
<br />
She joined the table just before Marie did and thankfully she was clothed for breakfast. Naomi looked Lily&#39;s way exclaiming she had a gift for her when they finished eating. Despite the numerous times she&#39;d tricked her, Lily fell for it every time but, there was always a gift for her later. A beautiful figurine was placed on the table and Lily marveled at it for just a little too long. The skirt and panties were pulled down and she had full view of its small vagina. Unable to do anything else, Lily scurried back into her room lest they see how embarrassed she was. Accompanying her flight was Naomi&#39;s energetic laughter and Eve&#39;s soft scolding. <br />
<br />
In her room, Lily felt as if the world could be pushed out just for a time. So she walked over to sit on her bed and drift into a daydream while she waited for a turn at the shower. While in the daydream, she focused on her friends Eliza, Eve, and Marie. Together the four of them could do anything they set their minds to. Hearing Eve leaving the bathroom, Lily grabbed her own towel and a change of clothes. As she stepped out into the living area, she saw a small peach colored ball on the counter. Even knowing better, her curiosity got the best of her and she picked it up. The ball was soft and squishy, she loved those sorts of thing but, there was a slit that her fingers had covered. Turning the ball in her hand showed her what mistake she had made. Marie had left out one of her toys again, it was a vagina ball. Replacing the ball to its perch a blushing Lily close the bathroom door behind her. <br />
<br />
Thankfully, Marie must&#39;ve showered with Eve or before because Lily&#39;s own shower went undisturbed. Eve was always kind enough to adjust the shower to face as far as it could down for Lily. Being short of stature had made her cute but, it was horribly inconvenient. She squeezed her breasts together between arms and let herself smile, at least she was kinda big somewhere. As she washed herself, the sponge brushed over her trimmed pubic hairs. Though she doubted anyone would want her for anything but a toy, she kept it neat just in case. Turning the shower off, she dried and changed into her new clothes to face the day.<br />
<br />
Living together with her two best friends had boosted her confidence about living away from Mom and Dad. Marie and Eve took great care of her, though it was mostly Eve doting on her all the time. She&#39;d never tell Eve but, she kind of had a crush on her... Squirming girlishly to herself, Lily sighed contentedly sliding into a daydream where Eve whisked her away. The day fled quickly into night again when they met up in the living area for dinner. Marie never liked to be out of her room for long but, she&#39;d always come out for Eve. Nobody could deny Eve with her sweet and motherly personality. They split up for the night returning to their separate rooms to wait for morning to come.<br />
<br />
Lily put on her favorite pink kitty paw pajamas, they were just so cute! It was her little secret, all to herself that she still wore printed clothing even her panties. While she laid down to drift off to sleep a knock came at her door. &quot;Who is it?&quot; Lily called out and Eve responded from the other side. A night visit from Eve? Wonder what she wants... Giving Eve the okay to enter the larger woman sat at the edge of her bed. Eve was breathing heavily and there seemed to be a worry hidden in her eyes. Mustering her courage, she sat up and touched Eve on the shoulder as she always did for her. &quot;Eve? Are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could register what had happened, her covers were tossed aside and Eve positioned dominantly over her. A yelp of surprise escaped Lily&#39;s lips and Eve tenderly placed a finger over them. &quot;Shh...&quot; Eve murmured and then they were lip-locked in the best kiss in Lily&#39;s life. When Eve pulled away, Lily&#39;s panting breath came out of her still parted lips. What was going on? Was this a dream? She watched as Eve quickly discarded her clothes to the floor and parted Lily&#39;s pajama top. Undeniably, Lily wanted this for so long that dream or not she&#39;d let Eve have her way with her. The larger woman seemed to know this as she massaged and sucked on Lily&#39;s breasts. There was a cool breeze and then a warm breath on her nether region as Eve slid her pajama bottoms away. Already wet with desire, Lily took a sharp breath as Eve&#39;s tongue plunged inside of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eve... Oh, Eve, yes... Mmm...&quot; Lily spoke softly between breaths trying to keep from having Marie hear them. Lily&#39;s arms reached down shakily holding Eve&#39;s head against her vagina, she hadn&#39;t noticed how big her hands were in comparison now. Pressing Eve&#39;s face deeper inside her, Lily&#39;s trembling legs locked onto Eve as well. &quot;Eve! Ahhh!&quot; She couldn&#39;t stop herself from crying out and she released into the doll&#39;s face. Breath rolling huskily out of her mouth she drifted off to sleep. One day, a real person would take her like that, until then she had her special doll. <br />
<br />
In the morning, Lily awoke to the aftermath of her wet dream fantasy. She had to pull gently on the doll as it had stuck to her vagina over the hours. Biting her lip against the stimulus, she pried her favorite doll free. It wasn&#39;t that she really liked sexy things, she just wanted to become bolder. So she had bought the highly detailed doll online with the black lingerie option. She carried the doll under her arm out into the living area of her two bedroom apartment. The rent was cheap and she used the other room as a game room. Setting down with a bowl of cereal she had sat the doll in the seat across from her. Over the smell of the cereal wafted the smell of herself from the doll&#39;s face, she&#39;d have to wash it again... While she ate, she thought to herself that she wished she&#39;d had others to eat with, not that she didn&#39;t enjoy the doll&#39;s company. The thought came quickly to her even though the doll was just an inanimate object she didn&#39;t want to neglect it. <br />
<br />
Breakfast finished and the bowl deposited in the sink, she picked up the doll noticing that the panties were stuck against it. Glancing around as if someone could see her, she sniffed the doll&#39;s crotch. It smelled... Different... As if maybe it was someone else? Impossible, she thought to herself as she moved on into the game room. In the game room she blushed as she passed the vagina ball and figurine on the desk. Immersion therapy, she told herself whenever she saw the two items. That&#39;s why she&#39;d had stripped the figurine as far as she could after all. If she could get used to such risque things, she could become bolder so much faster. Before she sat down in her recliner, she bent down and pushed the clit on her custom game system.<br />
<br />
It took a moment for her to find the new game she had bought last week. &quot;Roommate Relations&quot; was the name on the cover and the five girls on the cover were the options. She wondered a bit why they included the silhouette for your character... Taking the disc out, she slid it into the vagina-like opening and the machine gave a feminine moan in reply. Settling into her recliner, she sat the doll in her lap and held the custom breast themed controller at the ready. Soon the game loaded and she was met with the nude images of the girls available. She blushed deeply and pushed new game as her therapy began. <br />
<br />
There was a beautiful blonde named Natasha, the figure of which she had sitting next to the TV. The next option was the Sun-kissed athlete, Naomi.  After Naomi was the intelligent love interest, Eliza. Further along was the one she&#39;d pursue first, Eve. Looking at the doll in her lap, she decided since the two looked alike, that&#39;s what she&#39;d call the doll from now on. Lastly, was the shut-in gamer girl, Marie. She selected Eve and the game opened the story. Lily noticed that the apartment in the game looked almost like hers but, with two additional rooms. Shaking her head with a nonchalant scoff at the coincidence she played onward. What really startled her was when Eve in the game said her name in the voice line. It never asked for a name input and it was definitely scripted if the character actually spoke the name. A little jittery, she tried to brush it off each time she&#39;d heard it. The undeniable straw was when the first sex scene for Eve came up and it was Lily in Lily&#39;s own room underneath the large girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d take you that long to realize something was wrong...&quot; A voice spoke from behind Lily. The confidence and the sound of it was somewhat familiar.<br />
<br />
Lily turned around in her chair to see the magician she&#39;d met a few days ago seated with legs crossed on the bookshelf behind her. With a start, Lily leapt out of her chair dropping the doll to the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that anyway to treat your friends...?&quot; The magic woman said with a mock pout as she looked at the doll by Lily&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
Friends? What did she mean by.... Lily&#39;s thought trailed off as she looked down at the doll and a flood of memories returned. There were two new ones that weren&#39;t hers before. She walked in shock as her friends Naomi and Eve shrank away leaving underwear and a doll where they were. Reluctantly she turned toward the TV and it&#39;s accompanying object, once more there was a flood with two more extras. Again Lily stood by and what as her friends Natasha and Eliza slowly became sexual objects to gawk at. Unsure if she should, she turned her gaze to the game system on the floor and once last rush of memories came to her. Marie had been pulled apart and molded into the very game system at her feet, she tossed the controller in surprise knowing what she had been holding. Her attention turned back to the magic woman in the back of the room, had she done this to them?<br />
<br />
Lily wanted to flee before the same fate befell her too, maybe she could get help. Her body refused to move as the magic woman stepped closer to her. With a snap of her fingers, Lily&#39;s clothes were in a pile at her feet and the woman picked up Naomi and Eve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold them would you?&quot; She spoke and so Lily did. She hugged the doll in her arms as she felt she was meant to.  The woman tapped a finger thoughtfully to her lips as looked Lily over. Then with a brush of her hands, Lily felt her shoulder flatten out. Deciding that she didn&#39;t like where the Eve was, the woman took her and placed her wedged between Lily&#39;s breasts which held in place. &quot;Hmm...&quot; Thinking again the woman picked up the console unplugging it. She placed it in between Lily&#39;s spread legs and pushed upward into her. Lily felt her vagina and ass cheeks parting to accept the console inside them.<br />
<br />
In the blink on eye, if Lily were able to blink after all they were in the magic woman&#39;s manor. They had come to this room to ask her to grant their wishes... How was she&#39;d done to them granting their wishes?<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s simple Darling...&quot; The woman stepped up to her with her final to friend held in her arm. A finger was placed under Lily&#39;s chin and the woman sneered. &quot;I granted them my way.&quot; Natasha was set on the shelf of her right shoulder and Eliza was set in a cup-hole on her flattened left shoulder. Reaching up to her head the woman sat the controller on her head much like an oversized bow. Lastly, she was handed the case for the game her friends had been made a part of. With a strange sensation, Lily&#39;s body felt as if it were made of heavy plastic. There was a mirror being brought in by a maid and it was set in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the other&#39;s had gotten to know what they became, Dear. So it&#39;s only fair.&quot; The magician grinned triumphantly.<br />
<br />
There in the mirror was a plastic stand in of Lily, all of her friends were placed on or in her. As a drifting thought, she knew her new purpose, she had become an ornate display for them all. Focusing hard on the reflection of the game case, was the last straw to send her reeling. The black silhouette under Eve&#39;s arm had been replaced with an image of Lily. The magician had come in close before Lily realized and whispered softly into her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you&#39;re together forever, my sweets...&quot;</p>
