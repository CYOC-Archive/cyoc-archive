<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vincent was a 12 year old. 4&#39;3&quot; tall he often is picked on by bullies. He has long brown hair, and green eyes. His favorite color is violet. He lived with his dad only. His mom died when he was 10. Since that day he has had trouble controlling his bladder and thus wears diapers. He is secretly gay and has a crush on George. He was wearing slip on, shorts over a pull-up, and a tank-top.He has a backpack with clothes for himself. Fetishes are domination, bdsm, and pet/slave play.<br />
<br />
Frank was Vincent&#39;s father who had come to ensure his sons safety.6&#39;4&quot; tall with rugged features he looked like a lumberjack. As construction worker and frequent member at a local gym it was no surprise he had such well developed muscles. Favorite color was yellow. Frank is a responsible man but he can be forgetful, he is also boisterous and loud. Today he forgot to bring any bags with clothes for him in them. His clothing is a pair of shorts, sandals, and a tank top, he forgot underwear and so is going commando. fetishes include sensory deprivation, submission, and bondage.<br />
<br />
Hank was 14 years old. he had short red hair, and blue eyes. his favorite color was white. He lives with his Mom after a divorce with his brother George. He was straight, but was single. At night he wets himself because he likes it. he also enjoys wetting his pants. Hank was wearing slip-on shoes, shorts over his pull-up, and a tank top. He is forced to wear the pull-up this day because he wet his pants and his parents caught him. They didn&#39;t send any extra diapers or pull-ups, and he failed to grab any spare underwear. Fetishes include watersports and exhibitionism.<br />
<br />
Montana was 11 years old. He had short dirty blond hair, and blue eyes. His favorite color was indigo. At night and day, he wet himself due to stress. The stress was mostly caused by his parents divorcing, and he lives with his dad only now. Due to his problem, he wore diapers and was wearing sweats over his diapers. A t-shirt, and tennis shoes were being worn. He also had a back pack with one extra diaper, and five pull-ups. He was going on this trip wishing that it would &#39;heal&#39; him and make him not need diapers anymore. Fetishes are hypnotizing others then changing their behavior.<br />
<br />
Stuart was 11 years old. He had short brown hair, and green eyes. He liked the color indigo. Both his parents were married but he too had high stress, and wore diapers for his night and day wetting. His stress was caused by parental arguments that have picked up recently.<br />
A diaper was being worn under his shorts. He was wearing flip-flops on his feet, and a tank top. he too had a backpack with two diapers and four pull-ups. He was going to the island to get away from he arguing parents, and trying to find something to make them stop. His fetishes are socks and feet.<br />
<br />
George (Hulk) was a 17 year old football player. At 6&#39;7&quot; tall, handsome, and massive muscles he was often one of the first asked to dance. He was often shy with his body. One of his most noticeable qualities was that when he gets determined almost nothing can stop him. Nick found out that he was gay after he saw George looking at man porn. No one else knows, not even his family. He is wearing tennis shoes, blue jeans, a long sleeved shirt that showed off his muscles, a parka to hide his muscles, and underneath his jeans he is wearing a jockstrap. He didn&#39;t pack much since he didn&#39;t know he was coming until the last minute and somehow packed 6 jockstraps, his speedo from when he tried out for swim team, a few  dildos, shorts and one t shirt. He came because his mom asked him to look after Hank. Fetishes are masochism, bdsm, crossdressing, and pet play<br />
<br />
As you get off the boat and onto the island you wonder if play this was a horrible idea.</p>
