<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">NEXT DAY<br />
<br />
I woke up this morning, feeling a little tired and achy. Sitting up, I found that my belly was a little heavier than normal, at least to my senses. Worried that I may become immobile with eggs at a point, I clasped the ring and wished that no matter how many eggs or how big my belly, I would always be able to move. I feel my back tingle, and the heaviness disappeared. I could still feel the weight of the eggs, but it was not pressing, or too much.<br />
<br />
Lately, over the last 6 months, I have been feeling lonely, so I decided to bring another from the real world. Using the ring, I sent my peripheral vision back to the over world. Nothing had changed, but I could see that there were a good few &quot;Missing&quot; posters with me on them around. Using the ring, I hunted down a woman, who had already had a child, a miscarriage by rape, and was okay with the idea of being impregnated by a monster. Using the ring&#39;s power, I teleported her to the pocket dimension, and she vanished.<br />
<br />
Returning to my naked, pregnant body, I found a young woman, about my age lying on the floor in front of me. Slowly, she opened her eyes, and saw me. I saw her eyes widen at my naked body, but more importantly, at my enormous belly. And I&#39;ll admit, it is quite big. It swells out from my stomach, the size of a medium sized exercise ball, 5 feet in circumference. My breasts, leaking the green fluid, rest on top of my swollen belly, my &quot;birthing&quot; hips giving me an exaggerated hourglass figure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot;, I say to the woman,&quot;what&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Emily, and you must be Julia, the woman who disappeared 6 months ago. So you have been raped?&quot; She asked. She is a nice looking woman, only a little shorter than me, with long shiny brown hair and twinkling blue eyes. Her breasts are a petite C cups, and she appears to be quite cute, her appear like that of the girl-next-door type. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, this isn&#39;t rape, and it&#39;s not what you think. I am in the middle of a pregnancy, as is obvious. But I am not holding a human child, or many as is most probably thought. I am pregnant with a monsters eggs.&quot; As I say this, I noticed Emily&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;From the look on your face, I suspect you have always fantasised about this?&quot;, I ask and she nods. &quot;I was raped 3 years ago, but the baby died from miscarriage. But no men want to take a woman who has been raped, and I came up with my own fantasy.&quot;, she said in a sorrowful voice. I waddled over and patted her on the back. <br />
<br />
I grabbed her hand and raised it to my belly, letting her feel the bumpy surface of the eggs, which was just noticeable beneath the skin of my belly/womb. &quot;Would you like to be like this with me?&quot; I asked, and she nods excitedly. I nod back, and then step back. &quot;First, I need to make some adjustments to your body in your health and such.&quot; She nods and I proceed to make the same changes I made to myself to her, consisting of the egg limit, the advanced healing, the immortality and the protecting from damage during the egg birth. Before we leave for the breeding chamber, I tell her that I would suggest that she removes her clothes for the process. She complies, and exposes her body, but keeps her bra and panties on, but exposing her cute body. Then I smile, and waddle out the door, leading her to the breeding room. While we are approaching, we hear large stomps coming from ahead. Emily shivers, and I pat her on the back.  The monster smells a new female, and wants to mate. <br />
<br />
The robots are curious, as to who this new person is, and I tell them she is a new objectives, and they are to treat her the same way they treat me. Turning to Emily, I explain in a hushed voice what will happen, and she nods. Stepping into the chamber, she signals to us, and we closes the one-way windows. The monster stalks into the chamber, and as with me, the tentacles slither out, grabbing and restraining her arms and legs. However, he does something new this time. Reaching out with two tentacles, he latches onto her nipples, and I hear her let out a breathy gasp, as if something pierced her. The tentacles letting go, we watch as her breasts slowly swell, growing bigger than her B cups. Growing larger and larger, they soon stop at massive D cups, bobbling and bouncing on her chest with the perkiness of a high school girl&#39;s. The green fluid which leaks from my very own breasts begins to dribble from hers. <br />
<br />
The monster leaves them and gets down to the main event, a tentacles ripping off her panties and leaving her nude. Wasting no time, he lowers her onto the massive blue cock, as if smelling her arousal which is clearly visible. Emily begins to move up and down on the cock, making it thrust deep into her. The robots tell me that because she has already had a pregnancy, her body will allow close to the same amount of eggs as I am currently carrying now into her. Interested as I watch the process 3rd person, I watch as the bulge makes it way up the cock, waiting near the entrance. Suddenly, Emily screams, and I see a glimmer around her pussy. It must have penetrated her womb, and she had orgasmed. The bulge began to send little bulges down it. Each one entering her birth canal and rushing into the womb. As first, there is no visible change. Then I see her belly begin to bloat. It slowly grow larger and larger, eggs continually pushing in, though slower, The monster obviously understanding it&#39;s her first time. <br />
<br />
Her belly continues to swell, and we soon see her little belly button pop out. It grow from a regular 9 month pregnancy to twins, then triplets, then quadruplets, and it keeps growing. The monster continues to implant the eggs inside her, and soon, she looks almost 9 months pregnant with octuples. The monster continues to implant eggs, and soon she is almost the same size as me. The monster pulls out, puts her gently on the ground, where she sits down, and crawls back to the tunnel, leaving the chamber. Emily sits there for a while, and after a few minutes, the doors open and I waddle over to her. She is sitting there, rubbing her belly with a dazed look on her face. &quot;It&#39;s so . . . full&quot;, she says, partly to herself. I nod, and help her to her feet, steadying her as she almost topples due to the weight. The robots inform me that she is in capacity of 1,234 eggs, and that my room had been expanded and updated for both of us. I nod, and relay the info to Emily, who smiled graciously. <br />
<br />
I lead her gently back to the room, supporting her as she gets used to the massive weight on her abdomen. We sok come to my room, and there are some changes. A new bed is now next to mine, and there is a second cabinet filled with different items. Emily waddles over and sits on the bed, her belly pushing into the space between her legs and forcing them open, resting on the bed. &quot;I can feel them.&quot; She said. I nod and sit next to her. Turning to the side, I hug her, by breasts pushing into her.</p>
