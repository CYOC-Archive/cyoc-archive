<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;MOOO!&quot; came out of Jacob's mouth. Dan nearly swerved into oncoming traffic. Did Jacob just moo like a cow?<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Dan asked, glancing at Jacob. Jacob wasn't looking at Dan, but his eyes were wide in alarm as he covered his mouth. Suddenly, Dan felt a burp coming up. He took another big gulp of his milk to prevent it. It worked, but his pants felt a little tight for some reason, especially around his thighs.<br />
<br />
Distracting himself from the sudden discomfort, he said to Jacob, &quot;You didn't answer me. What the hell was that? Did you just moo like a cow? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob removed his hands but didn't look at Dan when he answered, &quot;I have no idea. It just sorta came out. Like a burp or something.&quot; He looked at Dan. Dan quickly noticed a sudden concerned look on Jacob's face.<br />
<br />
Seconds later, Jacob mooed again, this time even louder than before. For some reason, Dan's cock swelled at the sound. Jacob's moo sounded a little sexy. Another burp traveled up Dan's throat, and, before he could stop himself, he also emitted a loud &quot;MOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clearly alarmed, Dan drove the car into an empty parking lot. Why had he just mooed? And why had he thought Jacob's moo was sexy.<br />
<br />
Similar thoughts were going through Jacob's head. Why had Dan just mooed? Why was his cock suddenly rock hard from staring at Dan's hot body and hearing his sexy moo? Woah, where had that come from? Sure, Dan's body was pretty great, but he never got this aroused over just staring at it. He had a girlfriend too. But that didn't mean he couldn't appreciate the male human body. And Dan's body happened to be the ideal specimen for him to admire. He looked back at Dan to continue eyeballing his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooo!&quot; he uttered again, less concerned about it this time. Dan tensed up at the sound. His face turned a little red, and Jacob thought he heard a barely audible moan coming from Dan's mouth.<br />
<br />
Dan's cock was rock hard now, straining almost painfully against his pants. Dan felt his legs swell a little too when Jacob had mooed for a third time. He looked at Jacob and couldn't help but admire his partner's body. It seemed to have grown a little muscular since the last time he saw it. The idea that the last time he saw it was less than five minutes ago never occurred to him. Jacob looked pretty good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooo!&quot; Dan said for the second time. A look of lust flashed in Jacob's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you just moo again?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't help it,&quot; Dan replied, smiling. &quot;Each time I look at your hot body, I feel compelled to moo. So I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here,&quot; Jacob said. He looked away but quickly looked back at his mooing partner. &quot;MOOOooo. See, I can't stop myself from doing it. You're just so sexy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan imitated Jacob's motion and also mooed. &quot;I no longer want you to stop mooing. Keep going,&quot; he urged, rubbing his cock through his pants. Jacob couldn't hold back any longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOooo!&quot; he moaned, undoing his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOoooOOOoo!&quot; Dan moaned back, his thighs swelling so much that they could burst through his pants. His feet felt a little strange too, but Dan was too distracted.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOooo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOooo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon, they weren't even looking at each other anymore. Their partner's moos had started sending waves of pleasure over them. They had shucked their shirts off, unzipped their pants, and were now jacking their very swollen cocks off to the sounds of the other's moos. Their muscles hardened and swelled to bodybuilder proportions. Their asses began to swell, pushing their heads into the ceiling of the car.<br />
<br />
No longer able to fit inside the car due to their massive proportions, Dan and Jacob spilled out of the car and stopped mooing. But their physical changes didn't stop. As they stood, their pants ripped away to reveal humongous thigh muscles, as big as a bull's. Their skins were becoming leathery and had a thin layer of colored fur growing in. Their bull-cocks, now free from the confines of the pants, swelled to almost two feet long and rock hard. Their shoes busted open as newly-formed hooves clomped out of them. Their ears grew longer and migrated towards the top of their head, where new horns were growing in.<br />
<br />
The two of them arched their backs and yelled &quot;MOOOOOO!&quot; as their faces extended and formed snouts, signaling the last of the changes.<br />
<br />
They stood there, gasping for breath. They turned to look at each other and mooed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Dan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're so fucking hot,&quot; Jacob finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you,&quot; Dan replied. He sniffed the air. &quot;You even smell hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob also sniffed the air, looked at Dan again, and said, &quot;Moooo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! MOOO!&quot; Dan moaned, falling to his knees and gripping his cock. Their hands remained humanoid. &quot;Your moo is so hot! I want you inside me! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Jacob replied. He quickly crossed the distance between them, pulled his lover up, and stuck his cock up Dan's ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah! Mooo! That's it, bull! Mooo! Mate with me! Mooo! I love you! Mooo! You are my mate! Mooo! Fuck me, oohMooo, harder!&quot; Dan's cries, moans, and moos kept driving Jacob wilder and wilder.<br />
<br />
In less than a minute, Jacob said, &quot;Oh oh oh oh. I'm, moo, going, moo, to, moo, CUUUUMMMMOOOOO!&quot; His bull-cock pumped his bull seed into Dan's ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;YEES! MOOOOOOO!&quot; Dan moaned loudly, his cock also exploding. They kept orgasming for five more minutes, cum leaking out of Dan's ass and forming puddles as their hooves.<br />
<br />
When their orgasm died down and Jacob pulled out, the two bullmen stood there, gasping for breath and enjoying the afterglow of their intense orgasms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot; asked Dan.</p>
