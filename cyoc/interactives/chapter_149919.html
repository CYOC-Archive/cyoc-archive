He&#39;d retreated to his room to think about about his situation and avoid possible triggers of the curse while she&#39;d gone out to do some grocery shopping. However, neither of them knew that their next transformation was waiting for them...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
James had practically paced a hole in his carpet, racking his brain for some glimmer of a way out of his predicament. He knew that avoiding any kind of arousal or attraction was going to be nearly impossible so long as he was around other people. That meant he needed to go some place isolated and hope that he could at least keep others from sharing his fate.<br />
<br />
Of course, he&#39;d have to try and contact Nick before he left. The guy didn&#39;t ask to be dragged into this &#39;were-breeder&#39; thing, and James felt guilty about that most of all among the things he&#39;d done back at the beach. The multiple transformations back and forth had really let him put his shitty behavior in perspective.  All because he&#39;d allowed his own bigotry to get the better of him.<br />
<br />
Digging out of his phone, he began scrolling through his contacts list. It was a bit of a long shot as he didn&#39;t remember adding Nick&#39;s number to it, but maybe one of his... other selves had? If not, it meant he was gonna have to risk leaving the apartment.<br />
<br />
As he flicked through his various contacts, his finger slipped and clicked on a message from one of his ex-boyfriends. It only took a few seconds for the image of a mostly nude guy to get a reaction from  James&#39;s member, which had been been starved of stimulation as a precaution against transformation. <br />
<br />
&quot;No..no..NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was too late. The curse had been triggered and James&#39; next transformation was about to begin...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, Sarah had gotten to the supermarket without an incident. She grabbed a cart and rolled inside. However, as she casually moved up and down the aisles, her thoughts turned back to what her roommate had told earlier. <br />
<br />
Despite James&#39; words being heavy with sincerity, there were still a few nagging doubts in the back of her mind. After all, when considered logically, the whole &#39;were-breeder&#39; curse did sound like something from a bad movie. And what about that weird device he mentioned, that Chronivac thing? It was even more far-fetched that this curse business. <br />
<br />
Of course, the young lesbian was as of yet wholly unaware of her own cursed condition. Had she known, she might not have left the apartment so eagerly. But ignorance is bliss, and she soon finished up her grocery shopping. Heading out into the parking lot, she loaded up her car and started back to the apartment. <br />
<br />
Driving along, she was stopped at a red light when a bus pulled up alongside her. Plastered across its side was a very suggestive ad for a certain movie featuring Jessica Bling and Jack Burton. Sarah caught sight of it out of the corner of her eye, before her gaze turned fully towards the rather ample bust of the actress less than a few feet away from her. It sent an reflexive tingle of lust through her body, which was enough for the curse to be triggered once more.<br />
<br />
As it started to take effect, Sarah turned off the street and drove down another towards a beauty salon she somehow remembered was this way...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
James could feel the first tingles of change twitching through his muscles as he stumbled out into the hall of the apartment. His legs betrayed him as a sudden spasm sent him to the ground. There was a series of pops and cracks as his arms and legs lengthened and gained mass.<br />
<br />
He balled his hands into fists, trying to resist the changes wracking his body. But it was futile as new thoughts began to filter into his head, vocalized by a deep male voice condemning the sinful nature of homosexuality. There was a slight twinge of a Southern accent in the man&#39;s voice. James tried to shut the words out, but they creeped his brain anyway. <br />
<br />
His straining skinny jeans had already changed from denim to cotton, black dye fading into a rich tan one. Crisp creases folded out over the front of the pants while a thick brown leather belt cinched into place around his waist. As it tightened, his butt squared itself with muscle, pushing out the back of his slacks to reveal the thick wallet in one of the pockets. Around in the front, a thick and long lump pressed outwards and down his right leg. <br />
<br />
The sudden surge of growth caused the transforming James to flip over onto his back, just in time for his comfortable shoes to twist into a pair of well-polished dress shoes. There was a pressure on his chest now as well, as his t-shirt was struggling to contain all the new muscle his torse had developed. But then it too was changing, as a row of buttons popped into place down its front and the sleeves rolled down well-toned and tanned arms to button at his thick wrists. Soon a collar was rising up around his neck, followed by a red tie sliding into a perfect Windsor knot.<br />
<br />
In his own mind, James was fighting to hold onto himself as the deep voice continued to preach and rail against his old lifestyle. However, the spark of charisma in that voice lulled him into letting his guard down, allowing more of his memories to be altered. Gone was his love of men, replaced by a healthy attraction to women. His liberal arts education was replaced by years of theological study and rhetoric. And lastly, he could hear the chimes of wedding bells...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Sarah pulled up to the Blessed Light Salon and got out of her car. She seemed to be running on automatic, as she walk inside. The young lady at the front gawked at her for a moment before a look of recognition washed over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Miss...you&#39;re here for your 11 o&#39;clock appointment!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...I think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me and we can start on your hair...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah followed the other woman, who was pretty cute. But that thought caused her to wince, as if it hurt her with its...wrongness. She was getting more confused by the moment as the young lady directed to sit down.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll start with your usual manicure, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded, as she offered her right hand. As the beautician began to work, so to did the curse. Short nails grew longer with each buff and bit of polish, That her fingers also slenderized was unnoticed, as another beautician joined them and began to work on her hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just lean back, ma&#39;am. I gotta give you a wash.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a click, Sarah&#39;s seat slid backwards and she could feel a jet of hot water wash over her head. She didn&#39;t see her short hair begin to grow out as shampoo was gently worked into it. Her natural brown was being cleansed, leaving behind a golden blonde mane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now moving onto the left, ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
The response came natural as the first beautician began to buff and apply polish to the nails on her left hand now. Raising her right hand, Sarah was at first surprised at the gold band looped around her ring finger But then a memory of her wedding day came bubbling to surface, pushing down the last traces of her attraction to women as it did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am, would you like a complimentary facial?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded affirmatively as a third beautician joined the group. This woman began to apply a thick cream over her face, and underneath this coating, skin was softening and cheeks were rising up. <br />
<br />
&quot;All done with your wash. Gonna put you the dryer now, ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lovely, my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah was losing herself in the bliss of this pampering, not hearing how much softer her voice had become and the definite Southern lilt that had crept into it. Soon, a doom of plastic and metal was lowered into place and jets of heated air began to dry her gorgeous blonde locks. It also melted away her old memories, and allowed new ones to settle into their place....<br />
<br />
======<br />
 <br />
 Back at the apartment, more changes were occuring to its furnishings. In the master bedroom,  one bed split into two and the closets filled with all sorts of fancy clothing.<br />
<br />
Pictures began to pop into place on walls, showing a happy couple engaging all sorts of wholesome and Christian activities. In the former guest room, the bed had become a thick oaken desk upon which sat a high-end laptop. On the wall behind it, a framed diploma appeared belonging to a Pastor James Truman, marking him as a graduate of the Sullivan Seminary.<br />
<br />
Out in the living room, the somewhat cheap chairs and couch had become thick and leather. The TV had pulled itself up on the wall, flattening into a very expensive flatscreen which flickered on to a news report about a pride parade due to be held somewhere in the Southwest in the near future.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
<br />
Back in the hall, the man on the ground began to stand up. His thick and strong hands brushed away wrinkles in his clean blue dress shirt and adjusted his tie. He paused to look at his reflection in a mirror. Something was off about it, but what?<br />
<br />
His hair grew thicker, darkening to a rich brown with the first hints of grey around his temples. Teeth straightened and whitening as a salt and pepper moustache and goatee grew into place over a chiseled jaw. Finally, a pair of glasses with yellow lens fell into place on his long nose, as his eyes turned hazel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there dat&#39;s better. Almost thought I was lookin&#39; at a stranger in my own house...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, he heard a faint sounds of a ringing phone coming from a tan jacket on the couch. With practiced ease, he pulled out the Cisdroid phone and answered the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who may I be speaking with?&quot;<br />
<br />
The words from the caller caused a furious response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breeder? Is this how you describe us heterosexual and proper American citizens with loving families? May the Lord bring on you! Shame on you and your sin, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
He then hung up on the deranged gay who&#39;d somehow gotten his personal number. How dare one of those kind call him! Just then, the phone rang agai. The Pastor James Truman was about to rip into the caller, but stopped as he recognized the sweet voice of his blushing bride...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally, my love!&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled, as unseen a gold wedding band looped into place around his right ring finger.<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
The woman sat up as the beauticans finished clearing away the towels and other tool of their trade. Her lovely golden locks had ben styled into a partial bee-hive, with bangs framing her face. Her long eyelashes fluttered over sea-green eyes as wine-colored lips pursed themselves. From her ears hung pearls suspended by gold, with a matching set looped tightly around her slender neck.<br />
<br />
Her hands adjusted the top of her pale white blouse with its pearl buttons, making sure the gold cross she wore on a chain was centered just above her blessedly abundant bust. Moving down,her hands smoothed out the tan skirt that hung just below her knees and her well-toned calves. It was pulled a little tight by her wide hips and thick thighs that combined to give a perfect heart-shaped ass. <br />
<br />
Standing up, her tan leather heel clicked on the marble floor of the salon. She picked up her brown leather purse and reached inside to grab her smartphone. Pressing a button, she waited as the dial tone disappeared to become a ring. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, James. I just wanted to ya&#39;ll know I&#39;m done at the salon...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally Truman handed off a credit card to one of the beauticians before she slipped on a pair of yellow lensed glasses that matched her husband&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;ll meet at the college campus in a half an hour for the protest rally? Love you, honeybunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Sally Truman, loving wife and partner of the Pastor James Truman made her way out of the salon and climbed into the SUV that had once been a certain lebsian&#39;s car. <br />
<br />
Soon the newest Were-Breeder couple would be in place to ensure the creation of a new sorority...</p>
