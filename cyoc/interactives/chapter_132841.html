<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Mary Elise letting Karen do the searching, She hoped to be able to clear the air and sit down with Kellie and the others. Trying to find the girls was proving to be more problematic than she anticipated. <br />
<br />
Karen had arrived relatively early to school with Mary Elise, the two wanted to make sure they arrived before the buses in hopes of finding the girls before class started. As Karen scoured the halls she was dismayed to find no sign of them. Sighing in frustration Karen entered the gym. “Hey you,” a voice called. Startled Karen turned only to let out a soft groan of frustration.<br />
<br />
Lisa, Kumiko and Samantha quickly approached Karen. The trio appeared anxious to talk as they ran towards her. Stopping short the three now gave Karen a quizzical look. “Your Karen right,” Lisa started. “Mary Elise’s friend.” Karen nodded shyly as she anxiously looked at the three. “Yeah I’m Karen,” she whispered. “I...I was looking for your sister and her friend. Have you seen them?”<br />
<br />
“Funny you should say that,” Lisa said. “We we’re looking for Mary. We need to talk with her, like right now.” Karen took a small step backwards as she looked the three girls over. Karen knew everything she wanted to know about Lisa and Kumiko and wasn’t their biggest fan. She thought the two girls arrogant and while they never bothered her, they didn’t exactly go out of their way to say hello either. “Listen,” Karen said nervously. “I..I already know about Mary’s ring and what happened, that’s why I’m looking for your sister. Mary told me everything.”<br />
<br />
Lisa, Kumiko, and Samantha gaped at Karen as they looked the shy dark haired teen over critically. They hadn’t expected that Karen would know and now worried that Mary Elise may have fed her half truths. “Karen,” Samantha said quietly. “WhAt exactly did Mary tell you?”<br />
<br />
“She told me she got in a fight with Lisa and found a magic ring,” she stated. “She also said she accidentally turned Jason’s friend into a donkey.”<br />
<br />
“You sure it was an accident,” Kumiko said critically causing Karen to grit her teeth. “Yes Kumi I’m sure,” she spat. Sighing Karen took off her glasses, rubbing her eyes. “Look,” she sighed. “I know that your not exactly on great terms with her but she’s really freaked out. She wanted me to find either Karen or Kellie to talk.” Lisa, Samantha and Kumiko gave each other doubtful looks before looking at Karen. “Karen,” Samantha said calmly, slowly approaching the girl. “Look, Mary, well....she’s kind of...nuts.”<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Karen screamed. “You know that’s not cool. Mary...Mary is just...” Karen trailed off, aside from herself and her mom no one knew how depressed the girl really was. Karen wanted to defend her friend but in doing so she felt it would betray her trust. Sighing she looked at the girls, angry that they didn’t understand. “Mary’s not nuts okay,” she grumbled. “She’s well...she’s just sad okay.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Kumiko gave her a curious look as Samantha placed a hand on her shoulder. “Okay fine,” she sighed. “I believe you Karen but you must know that the ring she has is dangerous. We..we just need to talk with her alright.”<br />
Before Karen could answer she noticed Samantha shiver slightly. Slowly Karen’s jaw dropped as she saw Samantha begin to change.<br />
<br />
Samantha’s skin began to lighten as her features began to change, her nose becoming smaller while her cheekbones began to soften. “What’s....what’s happening,” Samantha whispered as she looked at her shrinking hand. Karen could only gape in shock as Samantha began to shrink. The mini giantess was growing smaller. Samantha had originally been 6’3” but was now only about 5’9”. The girls muscles seemed to shrink as she grasped her loosening clothes. “I...I don’t know,” Karen whispered. Samantha pleadingly looked at the others as her impressive physique vanished, leaving a skinny, but athletic girl. Samantha now had to hold her shorts with one hand as she tried to adjust her now I’ll fitting shirt. “Oh my god Sammy,” Lisa exclaimed. “Your...your...”<br />
<br />
“She’s just another white girl,” <br />
<br />
Curiously the group spun around to see Mary Elise glaring at them. “That,” she yelled. “Is for putting your hands on my friend. Let’s see how she likes being just a regular girl.”<br />
<br />
“Mary what did you do,” Lisa screamed. Mary Elise glared at her rival as she ran her finger along her ring. “I changed her,” she muttered. “I made it so that she’s no longer Samoan. Now she’s 100% Caucasian, won’t be able to use all that muscle to intimidate anyone anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Mary,” Karen groaned. “Sammy wasn’t doing anything, we were talking that’s it and i TOLD YOU I would take care of this.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise narrowed her eyes as she looked between her friend and her rivals. “I though she was trying to hurt you,” Mary sighed. “I..I didn’t know.” Mary Elise hung her head slightly as Lisa and Kumiko stared angrily at her. “Sammy would never hurt a fly,” Lisa spat. “The only person that ever hurts anyone around here is you Mary.”<br />
<br />
“Okay enough,” Karen yelled, causing everyone to jump in surprise. “Look,” she sighed. “I know none of you think very highly of the other but this is ridiculous. Listen I was in the bathroom when Mary got in a fight with you Lisa. Whether you two want to admit it or not you were both acting like bitches.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Lisa stared dumbfounded at Karen, surprised at her outburst. Karen exhaled before looking Mary Elise and Lisa over. “Mary,” she sighed. “Look, I love you like a sister but you shouldn’t have brought her mom into the fight.” Maryopened her mouth to answer before quickly closing it and nodding. “And you Lisa,” she spat. “You came flying into the bathroom, threatening Mary, wanting to know what happened with her and Claudia. It was non of your business to begin with but you butted in and came in threatening Mary.”<br />
<br />
Lisa stared at Karen in disbelief before sighing and nodding sadly. Karen looked at the two girls sighing. “Look you two,” she sighed. “These things happen. You were both what...12...maybe 13? Everyone at that age is an asshole. But right now we are burying the hatchet, finding your sister and ending this catty bullshit. Do you understand me?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Lisa glared at each other before sighing and agreeing. “This doesn’t mean I like you Lisa,” Mary Elise grumbled. “Same goes for me Mary,” Lisa retorted. “Enough with the horseshit you two,” Karen grumbled. “Let’s just find your sister.” The girls all nodded as they anxiously looked at one another.</p>
