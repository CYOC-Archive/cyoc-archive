<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Wishing for infinite wishes, pfft, how original!*<br />
<br />
Jill continued walking to the gym, unable to believe how drunk she must have been to wish for something that has always been considered beyond the boundaries of any genie, fairy, or magic item. Change your body? Sure. Be rich all of a sudden? Also possible. Infinite wishes? Nah.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing I wish now is to not have taken that many shots of vodka yesterday.&quot; Jill whispered to herself as she massaged her forehead.<br />
<br />
To her surprise, all of a sudden the mild headaches stopped only a few seconds after she made her quiet wish. Jill thought of this to be a nice coincidence, but then she remembered the shooting star again. She stopped in the middle of the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Infinite wishes...&quot; escaped her mouth just as quietly as before. &quot;...that can&#39;t be, right?&quot; she asked herself. Just to be sure she wasn&#39;t imagining things, she made another generic wish.<br />
<br />
Still whispering, as to not embarass herself in public, she wished for 50 dollars. She checked her wallet, but no new bill was inside. She wondered if her headache disappearing really was just a coincidence until a looked in front of her and saw a dollar bill, guided by the wind, slowly decend, landing just a few inches shy of her feet. She picked it up, inspected it and put it in her wallet. Right after she looked all around herself, not wanting to be pranked by anyone she knew that might&#39;ve caught what she silently wished for. But no, noone that she even remotely knew was near. Just she and her new 50 dollars.<br />
<br />
Jill felt her heartrate increase steadily as she played with the possibility of truly having infinite wishes. But if she wanted to be sure, she had to wish for something that was basically impossible. And she just so happened to know how to combine an impossible wish with a useful one, were it true.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish to be back in my room&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately after she stated her wish, her vision went blurry. She closed her eyes, shook her head, and opened them again. The dizzyness was gone, but now she was actually standing in her room! She couldn&#39;t believe it. She squeeked with pure excitement. In mere moments dozens of potential wishes rushed through her mind, so many possibilities, so many...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jill?&quot; a familiar voice called from behind the door, slowly opening it. It was Brooke. &quot;Didn&#39;t you want to go to the gym for your morning workout? Or aren&#39;t you feeling well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, no, I mean yes! I wanted to go, but I forgot something very important.&quot; Jill answered without thinking about it too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very important?&quot; Brooke followed up. Jill simply nodded with a fake smile. &quot;I hope it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Mandy. Messing with her alarm is one thing, but don&#39;t overdo it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mandy? No! It has nothing to do with her, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so.&quot; She stated as she left her room.<br />
<br />
Jill wanted to have some peace to figure out the limits of her new wishing power and couldn&#39;t stand her roommates getting wind of it or annoying her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish both Mandy and Brooke are on their way to the shop to get some groceries. Many groceries, in fact, they won&#39;t be back for quite some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
After one quick check of the kitchen, living room and both of their rooms, Jill was certain they were gone and much more confident in her own powers. Now that she knew that messing with people wasn&#39;t a problem, new options presented themselves. She had many ideas for her &quot;first true wish&quot;, but had to start with her passion: Her Athletism. As much as she liked soccer and wanted to be a big player, she always loved her defined body more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I had a more toned body.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so it was. She sprinted up to her full-length mirror and inspected her body after feeling that something what happening. All of her muscles felt sore for a moment, but then back to their old strength, and more. Her body has always been lean before, but now it was just that much tighter. While her muscles didn&#39;t grow much at all, their definition was incredible. Even her faint sixpack was now cut and toned. But then...<br />
<br />
...Then she remembered. She spent even more time in the gym, using up more free time just to achieve this kind of body, or at the very least, maintain it. Even her diet was very strict and boring, all for the goal of keeping this form.<br />
Apparently, when Jill wished that she &quot;had&quot; a more toned body, that was quite literally. Her entire life before that wish must have changed to accommodate for the changes to her body, which made sense. If she were to have used the right tense and said &quot;have&quot;, then her body would&#39;ve changed from one moment to the other, but without historical changes. Sure, everybody would have noticed, but that wasn&#39;t something that couldn&#39;t be changed with a few wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that nobody but me notices the changes I make with my wishes. For them it will be perfectly normal, even if I wish for something in front of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was quite the clever wish, Jill had to admit. With that out of the way, she was ready to go again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I wish I never had to work out to reach my current body.&quot;<br />
<br />
That wish alone left her with more time to be spend on improving at soccer, as well as granting her much more free time.<br />
This time, she delibarately wanted her wish to be historical. She remembered that a few year ago, with the start of puberty, the average looking girl that was Jill grew healthier and fitter with each month passing. While some had to work out for many hours a week to obtain a body like hers, all she ever did was play soccer after those effects began. Outside of that, she regularly ate fast food as well as big scoops of ice cream and other snacks, all the while her body was using those items as fuel for its muscle growth and toning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, this is nice! Sexy as hell without having to worry about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
She did a short victorious dance in front of the mirror before getting a hold of herself. There were still many, maaany more wishes to be made! And as she looked at a picture of her and her roommate Brooke, she knew exactly what time it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I wish I was taller than Brooke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill felt her entire body stretching, almost burning. her legs have taken most of her growth, leaving her at an impressive 6&#39;2&quot;, two inches taller than Brooke. Looking back at the picture, the two of them basically switched places. Instead of Brooke having a slight advantage over Jill, it was the other way around. But Jill didn&#39;t want to be just slightly taller.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was half a foot taller!&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, she surged higher and higher, not stopping until she hit a final height of 6&#39;8&quot;. A whole eight inches above Brooke! Taller than most guys as well! The picture of themwas taken from further away now to compensate for Jill being that much taller than Brooke. She didn&#39;t even think of Mandy yet, who&#39;s eyes only came up to her boobs.<br />
<br />
Speaking of boobs, those didn&#39;t look fitting anymore. Sure, they weren&#39;t the biggest to begin with since she was doing that much exercising, well, before the wishes, but that didn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t go bigger. Much bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I have big, firm and perky boobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wish was quite vague, but luckily her wishing power was nice enough to provide amazing results. She saw her boobs slowly inflate as if an electric pump was pumpin them bigger and fuller, all the way until they were quite the handfull. They were naturally perky as can be and had a great feel to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now to balance things out: I wish my butt is just as big as my boobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that, her toned ass filled up nicely, but to Jill&#39;s shock with pure, jiggly fat that looked out of place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish my butt is very toned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who needed all of that unnecessary fat anyway? Now Jill was poking her tight, hard ass that was protected by a firm layer of soft fat, just enough and not too much. She jumped up and down a bit and while her boobs were jiggling quite a bit, her ass almost didn&#39;t move at all, just slightly.<br />
<br />
One other gripe she had about her original body was that her soccer figure never that many curves. Well, now she had curves while looking from the side, but from the front she was still quite plain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I have a narrow waist and slightly wider hips.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before, she had quite the average waist at 29 inches, but now at 24 inches she was quite a bit slimmer while her hips flared out by a few inches, already giving her an hourglass shape. But she&#39;s seen many models online with even slimmer waist. Well, maybe not as toned stomachs as hers, but still...<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish my waist is even narrower.&quot;<br />
<br />
I almost looked cartoonish as her waist was pretty much clenched inwards by some sort of invisible belt, forcing her toned abdominals further together. While the look was almost impossible to achieve, Jill loved her over the top defined midriff that was a mere 21 inches around.<br />
<br />
So many changes already, but still there were so many more to go...</p>
