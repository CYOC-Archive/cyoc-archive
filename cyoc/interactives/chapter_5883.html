<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Bob turned to face the boy named Roy two guards wearing tight leather gloves grabbed him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You feller's take him to box stall twenty three and lock him inside!&quot; ordered Roy.<br />
<br />
Off went Bob with a struggle to his new home. Now the struggle was taking it's toll as in the heightened emotional state the infection worked much quicker.<br />
<br />
As he was shoved from the security guards grasp into the stall his shirt ripped down the front. Laying in the straw Bob's mind was a whirl with the terror of the moment. Arrested, infected, and changing into a horse would make anyone stop and think.<br />
<br />
A snort from his nostrils made Bob sit up a begin to take inventory of his body. The torn shirt offered a quick view of golden hairs sprouting from a blackened horse hide. A short squeal of horror eeked from Bob's lips as his head became fully horse shaped and growing.<br />
<br />
Getting to a standing position he tried to call down the barn's long isleway to anybody who might help. Try after try he called but as the echo touched his changing mind he finally realized he was screaming in whinnies.<br />
<br />
Now he turned round and shaking his head tried to think how to escape. As his shirt sleves ripped apart and fore legs replaced human arms his personal terror increased. A groan of pain as his pants and thick leather belt seemed so tight. <br />
<br />
Grubling to himself he fumbled with the belt till out of disgust he pressed the waistband and belt down over his legs and stepped out of the pants. Now he was totally naked from the waist down as he watched the hide spread and blacken out his pink skin. The orange-golden hairs of the Halflinger stallion was quickly covering him from head to foot.<br />
<br />
A reach for the locked stall door now brought more fear to a heart bursting from fear. His hands were gone and a tan colored hoof replace his hands. Wrists were now a fetlock to aid his ability to run on all fours. A quick turn and he let out a fearful whinnie!<br />
<br />
Bob began to whinnie and beat on the locked doors to his stall. Unknowing how the infection worked he'd been better off to lay quiet and over longer time change into a common and ignorant horse. Instead as so many others before him they too got upset and pressed the change to work very fast. Bob's body was growing and filling out to look like a Halflinger foal.<br />
<br />
The sudden strange feeling of touching turned him to look over his withers toward where he was being touched. The wisking foal's bushy tail was busy doing what came natural to a disturbed foal. The coarse hairs felt somehow calming and almost a tickling feeling. Bob' began to calm down a little.<br />
<br />
As he turned to see and reach for his butt the fact of his increased length and now hind legs brought him out of the dreamy state. Now he looked back, down, over and all around, he was a horse!<br />
<br />
Stomping about in the large stall the foal named Bob trotted, kicked it's hind legs high in the sudden and welcomed feeling of bright youth. Shaking his long face about the realization's of his new form were quickly making him accept the new way of life.<br />
<br />
A funny noise in one corner of the stall stopped his play for a look see.  A set of boards withdrew as a watering trough made of stainless steel took it's place. As Bob took a well needed drink another strange sound from the corner of the stall to his right.<br />
<br />
Plodding in an easy fashion he approached another section of his stall which was changing. As this section moved and turned to offer a steel pale filled with grain mixed with a corn sweetener. To one side was a partial bale of sweet hay which seemed very appealling to Bob in a strange sort of way.<br />
<br />
The new way of drinking and eating came very easy and as be crunched down the grains he looked about and decided this wasn't too bad of a place to live.<br />
<br />
Once he was stuffed and had laid down for a horsey nap he was awakened by the sound of his stall door opening. In walked two people dressed in a white suit which covered them from head to boot. Their calm speach made Bob get to his feet, hoofs. The two people came close to Bob and began to inspect his new and now very comfortable body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, here, and here too! Yes I see that too bad but it's all quite final now!&quot; talked the one man to what sounded like a lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you understand me?&quot; asked the older man as he looked from within his protective suit at Bob.<br />
<br />
A whinnie and a nod of his head proved his mental state was indeed still very human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob, may I call you that since we don't normallly change a changling's first name when they become part of the farm, tends to distract them and makes it tough on us too! You touched the Halflinger stallion which was good for you. Had you touched a mare your gender would have changed for sure. However having touch Sam you were not changed in gender but I'm sorry to say your quick and intense change did not transfer your testicles, therefore you are a gelding! You understand you are a unsexed male Halflinger and in a week from now the infection could not be transfered from you to others.  This is a great help to our need in the Park and Zoo for horses to pull coaches. As you grow and mature in size you will be in say six months put into team work and earn your keep. The infection has for you given your new self the extended lifetime equal to the human you were, therefore we expect with good care you might live here as a horse for say sixty years or more. Welcome, welcome to our fine Zoo!&quot; said the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Bob thought of all he'd just heard and felt he'd fallen into double trouble! He was now assuredly a Halflinger colt but sorry to say a gelded male horse. In times ahead he could mount a mare out of raw desires and possible instincts, but he had no way to feel the satisfied feeling of that surge of semen, he was screwed!</p>
