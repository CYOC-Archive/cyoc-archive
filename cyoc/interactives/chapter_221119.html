<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There is a brief pause from your mouse moving hand and shaky finger on the trigger as you hover the cursor over this particular option.  You still don&#39;t fully understand exactly what will play out if your chose to [Join Her], unable to fathom exactly how something like that was too work.  It&#39;s not like you would be instantly transported into the shewolf&#39;s bedroom on the spot, or that she would magically appear in yours.  And considering her state of mind in her beastly form, she is more liable to tear you to shreds than consider a good shag.  Worst still if she were to figure out your hand in her metamorphosis.<br />
<br />
And yet; this option taunts and flirts with you, imprinting some secret hypnotic suggestion that this is the option you want the most.  It is the one you want the most.  Before you is your vision of beauty, a lupine creature with the visage of her old feminine form hidden under the primal tones and animal pelt.  Every fiber of your being craves to go near, to lay a gentle hand upon her furry sides and caress her shapely feral figure; embrace and cuddle.  Sway to be taken.  Offer her true physical pleasure, mundane and human as you are.  Be the one to make her howl.<br />
<br />
Mate.<br />
<br />
Your twitchy finger eventually presses down hard and commits to your choice, the other options disappearing no longer obstructing the on-going scene on the stream.  Waiting for whatever is about to transpire; heart racing and eyes widening in anticipation, your own jaw unhinging, tongue lolling in a mild pant.<br />
<br />
The shewolf snarls at the glass barrier keeping the beast trapped in this manufactured den, pounding, and causing cracks to form. However; before she unleashes her fury completely, the shewolf&#39;s ears perk and erect; a look of realization crossing her eyes, as if she has just remembered something important. That being the latch on the door&#39;s handle keeping the sliding glass locked. With a soft whine her claws fiddle with the small lever until it unlocks. Padded forepaws press into the glass and starts pushing away from the edge, a light metallic screech sounding as she fully slides the glass open.<br />
<br />
She stands between the open door looking out into her backyard and patio deck, sniffing the cool aromatic night air as a grin stretches over her muzzled face, her tail starting to wag.  However; she simply stands there, a clawed handpaw propped against the archway.  You start to wander if there is something that has caught her attention and is attentively observing, dragging the mouse cursor to the list of camera views to see if you can get a better idea of what is happening outside if possible.<br />
<br />
But the list is inactive.  It&#39;s stuck on auto, everything else grayed out.<br />
<br />
In your confusion you are startled when you see the shewolf having turn her head and gaze back into her own room, golden eyes staring straight into the camera.  No...into you.  Her grin appears to widen, her tail wagging faster; a growlish cackle sounding as you dart your eyes around your own room baffled at the sudden eerie transition.<br />
<br />
Is...is the shewolf acknowledging you?  Can she sense you?  See you?<br />
<br />
The beast turns the front of her furry body closer to the camera&#39;s view, a slight nod and a fluttering glance teasing flirtatious invitation as one handpaw glides up her stomach, parting fur from her underbelly revealing her small animal teats; padded fingers massaging the dark sensitive points.  She tilts her head back a bit, a pleasant whine squealing as fondling clawed fingers trail back down between hairy thighs, carefully rubbing her slick feral folds unabashedly for the camera.  For you.<br />
<br />
It becomes harder to remain seated in your chair, shoving it aside and standing on your feet; on the tip of your toes.  You lean over your desk staying propped on trembling cramping hands, your face perhaps too close to the monitor while, all the while, continuing to let your own animal surface submitting to heated panting; drool collecting on top your keyboard.  Watching the beastly shewolf pleasuring herself willingly to the audience behind the camera; to you makes it uncomfortable to remain in your suddenly itchy, tight, and sweltering clothes hastily peeling them off and tossing them aside until you yourself stand butt-naked.  It certainly relieves your throbbing staff from its stuffy confinement, pulsing rod already leaving drool of its own from all the erotic stimulation of watching the shewolf change; imagining what primal fun she experienced in her wet dream.<br />
<br />
She almost appears to respond to your freedom of your inhibitions, her grin widening into a snarling smile as she swipes her handpaws around the sliding doors archway keeping herself from doubling over and backward, letting out an exhilarating howl.  Enchanted by the monster&#39;s song, you huff and whine before unleashing a triumphant howl yourself matching the elation.<br />
<br />
Wild eyes snap back to the monitor screen immediately, breath raspy and growly, hunched into a more awkward beastly posture of your own.  You watch as the panting shewolf looks back once more into the camera in the room before returning her attention to the backyard.  She finally steps outsides gingerly walking upon the deck, the tips of her clawed toes tapping upon the wood.  She herself begins to hunch; forepaws tucked close to her chest ready to meet the grassy floor as she falls foreward onto all fours.  She approaches the edge of your yard between her flower garden, looking past into the dark woodlands beyond.<br />
<br />
The camera never shifts however remaining stationed on top of her bed.  You wish to check if the list of views has finally opened up so you can move the stream&#39;s perspective up close, but you feel compelled to keep your eyes on the monitor not wanting to lose sight of your beautiful horny shewolf.  There also is the unusual strain and pulsing throughout your body, something you register but have no interest yet to care even as you can feel your muscles burn and almost bulge...much like certain bones aching and popping; bending and lengthening.<br />
<br />
The shewolf doesn&#39;t move like before for some time, instead turning her head again back to the patio door staring inside her bedroom.  It truly feels like she knows you are watching as she smiles seductively back, her soft wagging tail swishing until raised and flagged.  She purposefully lowers her upper half closer to the grass while keeping her hindquarters and rump raised giving an intimate wiggle of her furry hips to the camera.  You can hear her whines and whimpers as she changes her position and rolls onto the ground lying on her back, knees spread wide as her beastly handpaws once more run and caress over her feral body.  She lets out another melodious howl, softer but carrying provocative need.<br />
<br />
She calls for you.  She wants to mate.  She needs her mate.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re starting to reach out to the monitor believing if you do you could possibly slip through, climb into her bedroom and hastily hurry to her side.  You can almost smell her animal musk and pheromones driving you insane, needing to mount your bitch instantly and fulfill each other&#39;s primal instincts now.<br />
<br />
However; the website itself appears to blue-ball you as the camera suddenly goes black, the stream apparently ended.  You stare bewildered at the monitor, jaw hanging (around from the panting); whining sharply.  All before feeling a rage boil, animal snarls spilling from gnashing teeth as you are about ready to smash your desk and go on a tirade, uncaring to whom may get in your way.<br />
<br />
You do end up smashing clenched fists into your desk cracking fake wood, popping some keys from your keyboard.  But before you slip deeper into this tirade you become aware enough of the oddity of your hands, rotating and unclenching, shocked to see similar developments of paw-like features molding.<br />
<br />
Dark claws peeling away your fingernails.  Rough leather padding swelling under your fingertips and palms.  A slight pull at the centers; urging to elongate.  A light fuzz thickening over them and spreading up your arms.<br />
<br />
This isn&#39;t happening...is it?  Are you actually beginning to transform into a wolf too?  How is this possible?  You were certain this was all some clever and professional movie-magic and editing to make what happened to the shewolf look authentic and real.  But...this is happening to you now.  How the hell do you explain this?  Or rather...how likely do you believe you this is real or a dream?  Maybe you fell asleep during the middle of the stream, the last few minutes and the idea of your fantasy now playing out in your own little primal dream.<br />
<br />
And if this is a dream, wouldn&#39;t that mean you could indeed fulfill your chosen option and Join your shewolf?  Would she still be waiting in the backyard?<br />
<br />
The monitor suddenly brightens as lines of text flash on the screen creating a minor distraction from your discovery.  The website is apparently thanking you for your participation in its abnormal erotic experiment, though you are stump to why it is say for YOUR PARTICIPATION.  For the choices you made for the shewolf?  It goes on to dictate how such choices has led to a unique ending, one that has the potential of being extended by how you chose next.  However; no block options come up on the screen afterwards leaving you further stumped by what this supernatural website means.<br />
<br />
That is until you hear your bedroom door suddenly crack open.  No one is coming in, but even with the sliver of open space you can sense an unusual void behind unable to see any sign of your hallway or the bathroom door beyond it.<br />
<br />
The website flashes a bit more text at you stating that, from here on, how this scenario plays out is in your hands...or paws.  It does leave one last warning to be careful how you venture from here as, while the website&#39;s host will continue to keep its participants as safe as possible, that does not mean real harm could occur...and not just to each other.  After that warning, the browser suddenly closes and returns to your desktop background.<br />
<br />
Real harm could occur?  What exactly does that mean?  And what is supposedly lying beyond your bedroom door?  And will you continue to allow the wolf surfacing inside you to take over completely?  Will you still be you when that happens?<br />
<br />
The website was right about one thing.  There are no options prepared in advance for you.  It&#39;s up to you to decide whether to open that door, free your wolf, or maybe see if you can wake from this bizarre dream.</p>
