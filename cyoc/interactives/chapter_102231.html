<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As John trudged home he felt very strange.  His clothes felt tight, and his whole body seemed to be swelling.  People gave him strange looks as he walked by, but he just kept muttering the same thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
But as he continued to walk the people he talked to seemed to be getting more and more skeptical.  He knew was containing to change.  He could see the scales creeping down his arms.  His hands were already completely covered in scales, and seemed to be getting longer and thicker.  Soon they would be nothing more than paws ending in a sharp claws.  At first he was upset that his large tail kept him from driving home in his car.  Now he was glad that he decided to walk.  He doubted he would be able to hold the wheel with his hands like this.  He heard his shirt rip as his chest continued to expand. He looked down and saw dark scales trailing down his chest.  His pants felt very tight, and he wondered how much longer they could hold up.  He tried to quicken his pace, but his feet hurt more with each step. He found it impossible to walk on his heels, and ending up walking on the balls of his feet. He felt unsteady walking this way at first, but found it easier as time passed. The large tail dragging behind him also slowed him down.<br />
<br />
John once again cursed the strange drink that caused this.  It was only supposed to give him a tail, not turn him into some kind of monster.  Once again he wished that he had kept the can so he could get some answers.  But he didn&#39;t have time to go back to the store.  If he didn&#39;t get home soon, he would be walking down the street nude.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a gaggle of young girls surrounded him, blocking his path.  One of the girls stepped forward and eyed him suspiciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?  Are you sick or something?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a costume, &quot; said John for the millionth time.  His voice sounded deep and gravely.  His lips felt strange, and he found it difficult to form words properly.  He ran his tongue around his mouth.  His jaw felt strange, almost longer.  His teeth were sharper, and he almost nicked his tongue.<br />
<br />
The other girls stayed put, but the lead girl came closer.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t look like a costume, &quot; said the girl as she reached forward to touch him.  John slapped her hand away with surprising force. The girl winced and rubbed her hand.  John looked around, and saw some adults begin to take more of an interest in him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, just let me pass, &quot; said John.  He slurred the words, and they were almost unintelligible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look his eyes just changed! &quot; said another girl, as she pointed at his face.<br />
<br />
John blinked and the world swam as his vision changed when his eyes became reptilian slits.  He reached up and felt his face with a claw.  His jaw elongated into a snout beneath his hands. The children oohed and ahhed.  Suddenly, several more children appeared, and began to surround him, gawking at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this? Some kind of trick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s cool&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at the tail! It&#39;s wagging!&quot;<br />
<br />
John was beginning to panic.  He could feel the changes continuing, almost acceleratig.  His clothes groaned as his body continued to grow.  He saw parents slowly following their children towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, John!  Over here!&quot; <br />
<br />
Who was that?  How did they know his name?  John looked around and saw a small girl in brown pigtails running towards him with a leash and collar in her hand.  She ran up to his side, and grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, John.  Follow me!  We have to get out of here before it is too late!&quot; said the small girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, it&#39;s Amy.  The girl who loves dragons.  Is this some kind of joke?  I bet you set this up just to trick us and scare us. This is probably just some guy in a costume, &quot; said the leader of the pack. She kicked John  hard in the shin.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t hurt.  John&#39;s leathery skin was much too tough for a little girl to cause any damage.  But he reflexively jumped back, flexing his new powerful thigh muscles.  And that was all the stress his clothes need to rip apart.  They fell to the ground, leaving him nude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look!  He&#39;s naked!&quot; said one girl pointing to his groin.  He tried to cover himself, but found his arms would not bend properly.  He looked down and saw a strange bulbous white mass extending from a slit.  It suddenly retracted into his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is wrong with you?  Exposing yourself like that?&quot; said a mother, as she scooped up her child.  More adults appeared, and they looked very angry.  John looked around for help.  He tried to explain the situation, but could only grunt and growl.  The adults began to back away.  Now they were not so sure he wasn&#39;t a monster he appeared to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, over here.  Hurry!&quot; said the young girl in pigtails.  She was standing by the edge of some dense trees, motioning for him to follow.  John took off towards her with surprising speed.  The adults backed away to give him room.  As he followed the girl into the safety of the woods his back began to hurt as it lengthened with a series of sickening cracks.  He bent over as he ran, eventually running on all fours.  He looked back and saw that no one was following him.  He didn&#39;t know where he was going, but the pigtailed girl with the leash seemed to know. He didn&#39;t know who she was or how she knew his name, but he was grateful for her help.  As they neared a small barn on a horse ranch, she stood  by the door and motioned for him to follow.  John quickly entered, happy to be safely hidden.  He hoped she would have some answers for him now that they were safe and alone.</p>
