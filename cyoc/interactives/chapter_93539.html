<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I awoke quite late and quickly recalled the night before. Was it all a dream?<br />
Did I get lost in a fantasy during my total exhaustion last night? Maybe I<br />
hallucinated the whole thing in my tired state. I walked over to the door and<br />
found it to be unlocked. Pfft, I probably dreamed it all. I hopped into the<br />
shower and started laughing at my wild fantasy.<br />
<br />
I was a still bit unsure as to what would happen today, but shrugged off the<br />
feeling. A nice hearty breakfast and it is back on the road for me. I made my<br />
way to the dining room for breakfast and sat down at one of the tables.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning baby, I&#39;ll be with you in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked through the room wearing the same white robe as my dream. Oh crap,<br />
I mean last night. Instead of the red satin bra, her breasts were being<br />
restrained by a cream and black slip. She looked incredible, but I froze<br />
again, still realizing that everything was real.<br />
<br />
She came over to the table, reached down and put her hands round my face. She<br />
easily pulled me up to her lips and gave me an incredible kiss. As she let go,<br />
I fell back to my chair and the bruises from last night&#39;s spanking painfully<br />
made their presence known.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the breakfast stuff is on the table there, so help yourself sweetie pie.&quot;<br />
<br />
She went back through to the other room and I quickly scarfed down as much<br />
food as I possibly could. My appetite was hampered due to fear of what&#39;s<br />
coming next, but I needed to eat before I snuck out of this crazy woman&#39;s<br />
motel. Plus she seemed very preoccupied with the kitchen at the moment. After<br />
polishing off my last plate of pancakes, I quietly made my way back to the<br />
room to pack up my things and make it to the bus stop.<br />
<br />
Wait just a minute, is this my room? Where the heck are my bags? The room was<br />
seemingly empty, even the bathroom was cleaned out. Suddenly, Miss Brady<br />
opened the door and stood directly in front of me. Once again, her lovely<br />
breasts were pushed near my face. Her heavy perfume permeated every pore on<br />
her body and gave off a thrilling scent. I staggered back a couple steps and<br />
racked my brain for an escape plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s my little baby boy!&quot; exclaimed Miss Brady in delight while clapping<br />
her hands. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about your silly bags. I moved them into my room.<br />
My widdle, itty, bitty baby needs to be with his mummy all the time. Let&#39;s go<br />
see Mommy&#39;s room now.&quot; She smiled from ear to ear and grabbed me underneath my<br />
arms. She gently put me over her shoulder with great ease. As she carried me<br />
along the corridor, my groin was pressed against her right breast. Despite my<br />
best efforts, the excitement overran the terrifying fear of the situation and<br />
I started to get hard. She started to laugh (which didn&#39;t help matters) and<br />
said &quot;Oh sweetums, Momma is going to take care of every bit of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just let me take care of everything, my handsome baby.&quot; We stopped at a huge<br />
door, much larger than the rest. She placed me on the floor, between her and<br />
the door, and whispered &quot;Mummy keeps her key in a secret hiding place. Can you<br />
guess where it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Goodness, where could she hide anything in that tiny little white robe?! I<br />
searched her voluptuous body with my eyes, but didn&#39;t see any key sticking<br />
out. I started to venture a guess, but thought the wiser and just kept<br />
staring. Gosh, those breasts are intoxicating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, I don&#39;t know Miss Brady.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly baby, you are looking right at it!&quot; She reached down between her<br />
cavernous cleavage and pulled out a shiny silver key hanging from her neck. I<br />
looked closer and saw the words &#65533;Mommy Knows Best&#39; etched on the plating. She<br />
slid the key into the door, turned the lock, and swung the huge door open.<br />
&quot;Welcome to your new home, babykins,&quot; said an excited Miss Brady, &quot;Take a look<br />
at our special place.&quot; I slowly turned around and my jaw dropped wide open.<br />
<br />
Half of the enormous room was filled with typical bedroom furniture, except<br />
far to oversized for me. It looked custom built for Miss Brady, especially the<br />
four-post bed and the dresser with the vanity mirror. Even the adjoining<br />
master bathroom had custom built ceramic fixtures, which I could barely reach.<br />
But it was the other half of the room that truly terrified me.<br />
<br />
Baby furniture everywhere, except oddly larger like the rest of the room. As<br />
if for a giant...Oh no! I suddenly realized the scope of her plans. There was<br />
a giant crib in the corner of the room and a playpen off to the left filled<br />
with pink stuffed animals. A white table sat to the right of the crib with<br />
something white with little red specks stacked in a large pile on top. I<br />
squinted a little more. Oh crap, those are diapers with ladybugs on them. It<br />
was so overwhelming. Baby wipes, a giant stroller, a feeding chair, hundreds<br />
of toys, baby powder, and even wallpaper with dancing bears.<br />
<br />
Still standing slack jawed in the doorway; I turned to run from the room and<br />
ran right smack into Miss Brady. &quot;Oh no, oopsie-daisy! Did my baby want<br />
uppie?&quot; I had no idea what that meant, but soon figured it out when she picked<br />
me up again. This baby talk was beginning to give me a headache or perhaps the<br />
gravity of the situation. This amazon with crazy maternal instincts just<br />
wouldn&#39;t let up. I could tell she loved every second and couldn&#39;t wait to<br />
treat me like the baby she may have never had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Miss Brady, I think it&#39;s time to stop this before it goes any further,&quot; I<br />
said pleadingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on, you can call me mommy. Or mummy. Or momma. Miss Brady is what<br />
adults call me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Mis...Mommy, I am an adult and I&#39;m ready to stop playing this game. You<br />
are an extremely nice woman, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to go to the authorities<br />
if you continue. Let me go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Brady started belly laughing and shook all over. &quot;Silly baby, this is why<br />
I&#39;m your new mommy. You can&#39;t think for yourself. Now let&#39;s get you ready for<br />
playtime!&quot; I shuddered at the thought, but felt strangely excited at the same<br />
time. She carried me over to the changing table and started taking off my<br />
clothes. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me. She tossed my clothes<br />
into a nearby chute.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing with my clothes?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby boy doesn&#39;t need big boy clothes. They went down the diaper chute with<br />
the rest of your clothing&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything I owned was gone? The luggage? All my money? MY passport?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sweet cakes, Mommy will tell you all about that later. Let&#39;s get you<br />
cleaned up.&quot;<br />
She got a tub of water and a sponge from underneath the table to start washing<br />
me. My position on the table had me staring directly into those heaving<br />
breasts. They brushed across my body over and over while she lovingly covered<br />
every inch of my body with warm water. After about 10 minutes of this<br />
extremely erotic tease, she started applying a white cream that smelled like<br />
fresh cut kiwi all over my chest, face, and groin area. I couldn&#39;t help be<br />
overwhelmed with her undulating motions and lost myself for a second to her<br />
smooth touch. She started washing me again and I nearly started to lose it.<br />
<br />
But the feeling soon wilted when I realized what Momm...I mean Miss Brady had<br />
done to me. Every single hair, besides my haircut and eyebrows, on my body was<br />
gone. Washed away by her awful cream. I&#39;ve always looked much younger than my<br />
actual age, but this is just insane.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you do this to me?!&quot; I cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;My widdle boy needs to be smooth from now on,&quot; stated Miss Brady, &quot;Mommy<br />
loves smooth baby skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t even have the words for the moment. I felt so embarrassed, trapped,<br />
and scared at the same time. She wasted no time in covering my lower half with<br />
tons of baby powder, so much that a cloud wafted up into my face. I could<br />
barely see what she was doing, but felt a prickly material wrapped around my<br />
lower half. As the dust cleared, I realized that she had tightly pinned one of<br />
those large diapers to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does baby love his cute didee?&quot; beamed Miss Brady; &quot;I had them especially<br />
made for my special little boy.&quot; I started to tug at the waistband, but she<br />
pushed my hands away. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was the hair she removed or the<br />
material inside the diaper, but my cheeks and groin all felt incredibly<br />
prickly. The itchy feeling instantly sent blood coursing through my penis and<br />
kept me in a constant state of arousal. I certainly wasn&#39;t turned on at being<br />
in this situation, but my little head seemed to be betraying me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, it&#39;s so itchy. Can&#39;t I take this off?&quot; I cried in desperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, sweetums, the nappy stays. Baby might make a mess,&quot; purred Miss Brady,<br />
&quot;Besides, Mommy knows you feel so good right now.&quot; She patted the front of my<br />
diaper and my penis lurched at the slightest touch. I could tell she was so<br />
proud of herself. She leaned over to my right ear and her breasts pushed hard<br />
into my chest. The soft material of her robe and slip felt so wonderful on my<br />
smooth hairless chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sweet baby, Mommy thinks you are finally ready for playtime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gulp.</p>
