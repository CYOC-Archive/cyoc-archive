<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Good Morning. Its six am here in at KPXX; broadcasting here in Moon Lake. I’m Jason McPhill, filling in for Crazy Crabby Camellia; who is on maternity leave. As her on-air producer, I have the great pleasure to inform you all, that Crabby Cammy will be back tomorrow. The big news for this Thursday morning is snow! Yes we have snow on the ground, and quite the dusting we received last night. Meteorologist estimated a good four inches fell last evening. Whether it will stay or not is anyone’s guess. Now let’s head back to some music to start your day. Now it might not be Friday just yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t yearn for it by listening to The Cure’s Friday I’m Love.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t shut the alarm off Eric,” Spencer moans; “I like that song.”<br />
“Who doesn’t,” Eric chuckles while yawning; “but speaking of love?”<br />
“Why don’t we get up and have some breakfast first,” Frieda purring; “I smell bacon on a skillet and it’s intoxicating.”<br />
 Eric smiles as he gets up from being sandwiched between two weres as all three slept peacefully in Eric’s room. The white were-panther grins as he swishes his tail; gently using it to swat at Frieda’s and Spencer’s faces.<br />
“Stop that,” Spencer playfully batting at Eric’s tail with her paws.<br />
“Then get up,” Eric chuckles; “unless of course you want a musky reason to stay lying down.”<br />
Spencer seeing Eric’s member rising from its sheathe, purrs as she absently caresses her own sex with her paws; “you make it so difficult to resist that thick pleasure shaft of yours Eric. But fun can wait,“ Spencer getting up and giving Eric’s member a large lick with her rough tongue; “food first.”<br />
Frieda not wanting to be denied also takes her tongue and uses it to dance and tease Eric’s shaft.<br />
“Ooooooh,” Eric moans; “your lips say no, but your tongues say yes.”<br />
“Well,” Frieda smiling; “perhaps a quick blow job then.”<br />
<br />
Taking Eric’s shaft into her were-panther maw; Frieda starts to suck on the entire length as she moves her head back and forth, her tongue rubbing Eric’s shaft causing him to moan, purr and sighs as he rolls his green eyes in pleasure.<br />
“Oh god,” Eric panting; “you’re going to make me burst soon.”<br />
“That’s the plan,” Frieda mumbles as she sucks on Eric’s feline cock even harder.<br />
Spencer watching as she too can feel Eric about to burst thanks to their shared link; licks her lips in anticipation of the warm salty cream that is about spill forth.<br />
“Oooooooh,” Eric moans; “here it comes.”<br />
Frieda swallows hard as a large spurt enters her mouth. Consuming most of it as she continues to suck; a small stream dribbles from her mouth. Spencer seeing the sample eagerly laps it up as Eric shudders and purrs as he enjoys the dance Frieda’s tongue is doing on his shaft.<br />
“Perhaps now,” Frieda feeling Eric’s release from their shared link; “we can now head downstairs and eat breakfast.”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Eric grinning; his eyes fluttering as Spencer enjoys the sloppy second Frieda left for her.<br />
<br />
“They’re up,” William sipping his coffee; “to think we didn’t hear them sneaking up to Eric’s room last night.”<br />
“At least they slept,” Martha smiling as she starts cracking eggs in the same skillet that had bacon earlier; “did you hear them leave the basement to go outside last night?”<br />
“How couldn’t I,” William answering; “I guess they had some extra energy to expend before bed.”<br />
“They expended energy all right,” Nate smiling as he walks into the kitchen in his werewolf fursona. Pouring himself a cup of coffee as he sits down; “they went hunting.”<br />
<br />
Eric, Frieda and Spencer walk down the stair and enter the kitchen; each of their tails twitching as all three purr and sit next to each other at the table. William and Martha staring at the three; Nate grins while sipping his coffee.<br />
“So,” William looking at the three; “Nate said you did a little hunting last night. Anything I should know?”<br />
“We got a little hungry after having fun,” Eric answering; “and since you and mom made it quite clear that raiding the fridge was off limits.”<br />
“No,” Martha putting a plate of eggs and bacon down for each; “we said the lamb was off limits. To save some for Nate.”<br />
“And we did,” Eric answering; as he munches on his bacon.<br />
“I watched them hunt,” Nate answers; “while Frieda and Eric were clearly inexperienced, Spencer was quite knowledgeable in how to do a clean kill.”<br />
“Clean kill,” Martha looking shocked; “you killed the animal you hunted?”<br />
“Mom,” Nate sighing; “what they did was not illegal. As were’s we sometimes feel the primal urge to hunt and consume raw flesh. Most times hunts are catch and release. But when you do kill what you catch, it’s intended you eat the animal.”<br />
“But hunting season has long since passed,” William looking alarmed; “What you said-“<br />
“Hunting season never expires for were’s,” Nate calmly answers; “Moon Lake Animal Control monitors the game in and around the area. As long as you report your kill to them, then no laws of our town have been broken.”<br />
“You speak as if you’ve had experience in dealing with them,” William looking stern.<br />
“All werewolves in packs do,” Nate calmly answering; “at times we do pack hunts. Other times Ben, Alex and I will do catch and release hunts. Other times we have intense runs and eat a rabbit or two afterwards. It’s perfectly normal for a were.”<br />
<br />
“What is a catch and release hunt,” Martha asking?<br />
“Its what the name says,” Nate getting up to pour himself another cup of coffee; “you catch your prey. But instead of killing it, you let it go.”<br />
“Okay,” William sighing; “I think I get it now.” Looking at Eric, Spencer and Frieda as they eat breakfast; “so what did you take down last night?”<br />
“Four point buck,” Spencer is the first to answer.<br />
“Isn’t that big game,” William looking surprised?<br />
“Not as big as bagging a fourteen point buck with your father and grandfather;” Spencer smiling.<br />
“Nor as big as a grizzly bear,” Nate smiling; “during a pack hunt.”<br />
 “And your hunt was reported,” William eyeing the three?”<br />
“I made sure of it,” Nate answering; “I gave Eric the number he needed to report their kill and witnessed him give the particular details.” Putting his coffee down Nate looks at his father; “why don’t you and mom try hunting later tonight. Granted you should start with small game; rabbits, coyote and raccoon. Stay away from skunk; unless you want to reek of garbage for a week.”<br />
“I’m not sure,” William thinking; “perhaps we shouldn’t do anything that might rock the boat. What with the Statue 1A trial Eric and Frieda are testifying in today.”<br />
“That’s happening today,” Nate looking stunned; “you lucky buggers; you get to miss school.”<br />
“I don’t,” Spencer grumbles; “I have to be alone at school while Eric and Frieda drive me batty as I sense their passion while together.”<br />
<br />
Nate looks at his mother and father who in turn, look confused; not knowing that the bond the three formed, had made them able to sense each other’s emotions regardless of distance. Passion and pleasure being their favorite as the feelings compound upon each other while reveling in it. It’s what makes their love making the most intense one could experience.<br />
“Then perhaps you should try the hunting tomorrow then,” Nate suggesting; “if it will help, I can easily have Ben and Alex help explain and show you the basics.”<br />
“Your mother and I will think about it,” William getting up to grab a plate of eggs and bacon; “why don’t you three get ready for your day. And if you can’t keep your paws of each other,” William smiling; “then keep it as quite as possible.”<br />
<br />
Watching Eric, Spencer and Frieda thunder back upstairs; Nate William and Martha remain in the kitchen to eat breakfast.<br />
“four point buck,” William shaking his were-fox head; “your brother has moxy.”<br />
“Eric has taken to being a were-panther quite well,” Nate eating his eggs; “hell you should have seen him last night dad.” Nate chuckling; &quot;with all the blood covering his white fur with them eating that buck, he was well on his way to looking like a pink panther.”<br />
“How often do you hunt Nate,” Martha asking?<br />
“about twice a week,” Nate finishing his eggs and bacon; &quot;sometimes three times a week.&quot;<br />
“Are all of them catch and release,” William asking?<br />
“When I’m not hunting rabbit,” Nate putting his plate in the sink; “apart from sex, hunting is one hell of a way to expend energy when you are feeling restless.”</p>
