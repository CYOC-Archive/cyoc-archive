<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought about how to feed Mary now that she was a full tigress. He had an idea, but he needed to find some living critter. Soon he found a small bug and brought it home. Mary was looking at him with questioning eyes and he noticed.<br />
“Well, I thought about how to feed you. How about hunt down some prey?” Jeff asked.<br />
Mary licked her lips, but still did not understood what he was up to do.<br />
“Since you already ate a lot of meat, I think I will feed you with a small prey. What do you think about eating a small pig?”<br />
Mary just licked her lips again.<br />
Jeff went to their living room and sat in front of the vials cabinet. He searched through it until he found the pig vial. He poured its contents on a small cup and drowned the bug on it. After just a couple minutes, he felt like the bug was growing and saw that it was almost too big to the cup. He removed the bug from the cup and held it on his hands. When it developed a little snout, Jeff forced it to swallow the rest of the liquid from the vial. The changes on the bug accelerated and after just a few minutes, it was a big and fat pig. Jeff put the pig on their bathroom and closed the door.<br />
“Now all you have to do is go there and eat.” He told Mary. “But before you go there, lets head back to the living room.”<br />
They returned to the vials cabinet and Jeff looked for a new vial. Mary didn’t understand what he was searching now until he stopped at the behavioral changes. Jeff fumbled across the vials until he got one out.<br />
“This is it! Let’s try to change your behavior to that of a tiger. This label says that it is an ‘Animal Behavior’ vial. If you drink half of it, I think you will have some tiger instincts while remaining friendly to me. What do you think?”<br />
Mary didn’t want to lose her mind, but the experiment was appealing to her. She was still hungry; but she was also feeling sorry because she needed to kill a cute pig. She pondered for a moment and then nodded slowly. <br />
“I think you didn’t want it but I don’t think it will be a problem. Tomorrow you can tell me in details what happened to your mind in that period. Ok?”<br />
Mary nodded again and opened her mouth. Jeff poured half the vial on it and she swallow it. While waiting for the changes, Mary went to the computer, which still was on the tiger’s information page. She started to read a little more about her new body, using her claws gently on the keyboard to scroll down the page. While she read, she started to have increasing difficult to read the words. She knew she could read because she knew the letters well, but she wasn’t able to form the words anymore. <br />
Jeff had been watching her while she read and approached her when he saw that she stopped scrolling the text.<br />
“Are you having some problems reading?” He asked.<br />
Mary looked at him and was desperate. She couldn’t make a word of what he was saying. She thought that she was her wife and soon she thought about what is a wife. She could not remember what it was to be human despite knowing that she was one before.<br />
“Mary, are you listening to me? Please nod if you understand me!” Jeff asked.<br />
Mary looked at him and thought about what her mate was trying to say. She remembered that he was more than her mate, but she couldn’t remember what he was. She thought about herself and she could only think on filling her belly and then mating her mate. She sniffed the air and felt the smell of a prey. She followed the smell and Jeff noticed that she was in a hunting mode now. <br />
Jeff went ahead of her and opened their bathroom door. The pig was still in there, still thinking it was a bug. It saw the big tiger enter the bathroom and the door closing behind it. Mary was crouched on the ground and was looking straight to the pig. On a leap, Mary jumped on the pig and bit its neck, which broke on the impact.<br />
Jeff heard a stomp and soon everything went quiet. After a minute, he heard ripping and chewing noises. He carefully opened the door and saw his wife inside the tub, in a pool of pig blood. She was taking big bites of the pig and swallowing them whole. Jeff left the door open and went back to their bedroom. <br />
When Mary finished filling herself, she licked her fur clean and roamed through the house. She found a water bowl on the kitchen and drank from it. The water finished cleaning her face of all the blood she ate and then she sniffed the air for her mate’s smell. She followed his smell and found him on the bed, reading a book. <br />
“Hey, honey! Did you ate everything?”<br />
Mary did not answered and jumped on the bed with him. She lay on his side and then started licking his body. Jeff felt aroused and Mary noticed it on his smell. Her mate wanted to mate.<br />
Mary started to use her claws to remove his pajama pants. Soon Jeff was naked on the bed and Mary was licking his dick. When he was hard enough, Mary climbed him and sat on his member, growling as she felt him entering her. They mated like that for some time. Jeff was amazed at how small he was near his wife now. He caressed her breasts and noticed that she had six breasts now. They were all small on her but he thought she liked it, since she was growling even more.<br />
When he came, Mary also came and roared on the bedroom. Then she lay on her mate’s side and licked her fur clean again. Soon they were sleeping, with Mary hugging Jeff with a front and a hind leg.</p>
