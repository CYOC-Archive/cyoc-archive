<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda had gone inside the catch a new episode of her favorite TV show, leaving Sam and Taylor on the beach/dock area. The rest of their friends where off doing their own thing, two had gone uptown to get some more food to help finish off their vacation, knowing them they would be between 45 minutes and an hour. Three of the boys where off fishing on a boat they rented, and Rose and Nate had gone off to a more private area of the beach. She didn’t have to guess what they were doing, she didn’t fully approve of that but that was more of a moral objection and it was their choice in the end.<br />
<br />
She walked into the rented beach house, stopping for a moment to slip on a pair of shorts over her silver one-piece swimsuit. She didn’t want to get the couch wet when she sat down on it. <br />
<br />
She was much shorter than any of her female friends, being just 5’1 compared to the taller Rose at 5’7 or Taylor at 5’8 and their other friends where taller than them. She had all of them beat in one category, her bust. She adjusted her suit a bit which was stretched to near the point of breaking over her breasts. She had DD almost E cup breasts on such a small frame, and it caused a lot of pain on her back and her bra straps kept digging into her shoulders and jogging was a nightmare. What was maybe worse was that while she had this massive chest, she had been raised in a much more religious household and one of the things drilled into her head was modestly. <br />
<br />
Part of her wished she could be freer but she knew if she was caught sleeping with anyone her entire family would disown her and she would loss all her high school friends. She would still have the friends here, but friends do not make up for family and she was too afraid to risk losing her family.<br />
<br />
She looked down at her massive chest and the almost skintight silver one piece swimsuit and let out a resigned sigh, her parents wouldn’t have been pleased to see her in such a tight swimsuit. Her mother would understand her chest was almost as large as her daughters and she understood the struggles which came from it. <br />
<br />
She sat down, her long black hair pulled back in a bun and reached for the remote. She flipped it to the right channel and…the wrong show came up.<br />
<br />
She double checked the time on her cellphone, it was the time for the show. Then she checked the guide, the show was an hour from now.<br />
<br />
“Fudge.” Said Amanda, she would never curse as she hit the information guide and nodded. The show was the midseason final so it had been pushed back for a longer show. She turned the TV off, grabbing a drink from the fridge before heading back out toward the beach. She took off her shorts again, the deck was empty but that slow cooked meat smelled so good, she went down toward the beach calling for <br />
Sam and Taylor. <br />
<br />
She never heard it before it happened, a sharp pain in her side. She reached down and pulled a needle shaped shell from her hip area. It had hit her drawing a little amount of blood.<br />
<br />
“Who did that?” inquired Amanda <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that, but I was debating if we should head back when you just walked right onto the beach, I just had to do it.” Said a new voice as Amanda turned and looked out over the water, a women a beautiful women with lime green hair was swimming off shore.<br />
<br />
“Hello, who are you? Did you rent one of the other beach houses?” inquired Amanda<br />
<br />
“Not really but I am looking to bring more people home.” Said the green haired women as she ducked under the water, there was a blur of motion and she reappeared again, this time just on the edge of the water. She was nude aside from some shells, seaweed and fishing nets which formed a very revealing bra. She had nothing else on, because from her waist down was a lime green mermaid tail. This tail was clearly not a fake, it was far to real looking and it moved in ways which would have caused her legs bones to break if it was some kind of suit. <br />
<br />
“My name is Shelly, who are you?” inquired Shelly<br />
<br />
“Amanda, and you’re a mermaid.” Stated Amanda as Shelly nodded in conformation.<br />
<br />
“I never believed Mermaids where real.” Added Amanda as she walked toward the sand. “I need to call my friends over they will not believe this.”<br />
<br />
“Oh they will, four of them have already been transformed into merfolk.” Answered Shelly as Amanda stopped in place.<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Amanda<br />
<br />
“Look at your upper leg.” Answered Shelly as Amanda looked down, her upper leg on one side was being covered with a mixture of blue, light blue and silver scales.<br />
<br />
“MY GOD!” Yelled Amanda<br />
<br />
“Sorry, but Atlantis needs merfolk human pollution has caused our numbers to decline.” stated Shelly “Don’t worry you will live a great live in Atlantis, you can raise a family and you will be provided jobs to make your new home great.”<br />
<br />
“Amanda don’t worry being a mermaid is great.” Said a new voice as Amanda lifted her head up toward the sea to see Rose, Taylor, Nate and a black-haired mermaid she had never seen before but she looked familiar none then less. “I am Sam by the way, I go by Samantha now.”<br />
<br />
“My God.” said Amanda as she watched a female Sam give an open mouth kiss to Taylor, that wouldn’t be uncommon if he had been a he instead of a she however at the same time Nate was kissing Sam’s neck from behind and Rose was kissing Taylor’s neck in the same position.<br />
<br />
“Oh…that looks like fun.” Amanda said outload before shaking her head, what was wrong with her. As she did she imagined things that her faith would call horrifying and against their faith, open wild sex driven acts. Herself being taken by multiple merman and mermaids, her face covered in sexual fluids as she moaned in pleasure. Her parents and her faith would call what she imagined a whore, it looked like fun to her now.<br />
“What is wrong with me.” Said Amanda as she gripped her head.<br />
<br />
“The transformation tends to change people a bit as the sea calls to you.” Answered Shelly “Mermaids and Merman are far more sexually open, from what your friends told me about you that is likely what is happening.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Answered Amanda as it made sense, she had always been repressed, unable to be a woman a sexual active women, she had to be a holy container to keep herself pure until she said her vows to the man she would spend the rest of her life with. <br />
<br />
“Why do we have to do that?” asked herself in her head “We can be free, free to do what we want all we have to do is say goodbye to the land and our legs.”<br />
<br />
She looked down her feet where quickly getting covered with light blue, silver with a few dark navy blue scales. It was a pretty color combination she thought as she bent down and touched it, somehow her hand slipped under her suit and brushed against her now scaled covered womenhood. Even self pleasure was said to be a sin, that sin she had fought against but one she had always failed. <br />
<br />
First one finger, then two and finally three went inside her as she moaned in pleasure as she feel to her knees in the sand. All that repressed sexual energy was feeding the call to the sea far better then any of her friends. She was breathing heavily as she reached a high she had never been before as she pulled her fingers out they where covered with her juices. She brought them up to her nose with the intent of sniffing them only to have her tongue come out and lick it.<br />
<br />
It tasted so good and if this is how she tasted she wondered what other mermaids and more importantly merman tasted like. She entranced in the call of the sea she never noticed as her already massive chest ballooned out going from large DD cups almost E cups to well within the F range on the edge of G. Her chest was massive, yet her frame shrank a bit making them appear even larger even as the swimsuit ripped apart and fell away leaving her bare breasted. <br />
<br />
Normally being bare breasted in public would have been horrifying to Amanda, now she enjoyed it as she ran her hands over her chest moaning in pleasure at how sensitive they had become even as new muscles formed forming a kind of natural bra. She knew in the water her breasts would be supported even if it would mess with her speed even the size. She didn’t care as she reached up and undid her hair bun letting her dark hair flow down draping over her shoulders and part of her breasts as her legs fused together into a silver, light blue and dark blue tail. <br />
<br />
Amanda the modest, choir church going girl was no more, Amanda the bare breasted sexually hungry mermaid whore had come to be.</p>
