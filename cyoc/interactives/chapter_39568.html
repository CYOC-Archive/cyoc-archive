<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You silently cried all the way to Matt's house. You had to wonder if Matt was telling you the truth about your parents not wanting you. It's true that they weren't around much but that was because they both worked hard. Though they bought the expensive stuff for them, you got the cheap stuff. The latest video game system you had was a Super NES and you got that for Christmas last year. You were happy with it until you saw a rummage sticker on it, they only paid $5 for it. You had just a small black and white TV while your parents had a 52 inch high definition TV in their bedroom and living room. You weren't allowed to watch either of those TVs. It did seem like they didn't want you. Perhaps this would be better. Being Matt's transformation toy might not be so bad if he doesn't leave you as a two year old girl.<br />
<br />
At Matt's house you saw his mother and she asked &quot;Matt dear, is that your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she is&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're a good friend for getting her out of that house&quot; Matt's mom said. &quot;Though I'm not exactly sure about her being a two year old girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm not going to keep her this age&quot; Matt said. &quot;Though I'll keep her as a girl since you've always wanted a daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is her name?&quot; Matt's mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I thought I'd let you name her&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's sweet of you dear&quot; Matt's mom said. &quot;I was going to name you Melanie so I think that will be her name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You hear that?&quot; Matt asked. &quot;From now on your name is Melanie. You will answer to it or you will be punished. Do you understand Melanie?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod your head seeing as how you couldn't talk. You hoped that Matt would age you before you had to go. You regret thinking that almost immediately as you pee in your diaper and shortly after you pooped.<br />
<br />
Matt must have smelled it because he said &quot;Smells like somebody has a stinky butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt lays you down on a changing pad, removed your dirty diaper, wiped your bottom with a baby wipe, put a fresh diaper underneath you, powdered your bottom, and finally taped up the diaper. You had giggled a little bit when Matt wiped your slit but you were so embarrassed otherwise to have Matt changing your diaper. You suddenly remember that you were with Matt when he bought this stuff. He had said that his mom was expecting to take care of a little girl soon. Now you know that that little girl is you.<br />
<br />
You also remember Matt buying other things like a crib. Matt picked you up and took you to a room where you saw the crib he had bought. &quot;This is your room from now on Melanie&quot; Matt said. &quot;I know this is a shock to you but this is your life now. Mom has a regular bed on order for when you're older. It should be here in a month. If you're good I'll make you older when it comes. I know you can understand me but you can't say anything yet. Just know that I'm still your friend even though you may hate my guts right now. I had said that I would give the master ring to somebody else to scare you. I won't give this ring to anybody else. I also had to get you out of that house. Your so called parents didn't really care for you. When I approached them with this they were very excited to get rid of you. I think they plan on saying you ran away. My mom and dad will treat you just like their own daughter. I'm not sure how they're going to explain you being here but they told me that they would. Now you get an hour to play before your bath time and bed. You might want to play with some of the toys in here so you get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt put you down and led you over to a toy box. He stayed with you while you played with the toddler toys. You knew he would rather be playing his Playstation 3 but he stayed and watched you, even playing with some of them himself. He seemed to be happy watching you play. After an hour his mom came in, picked you up, and took you to the bathroom. There she took off your clothes and put you into the bathtub. She played with you for a bit while she washed you. You were starting to have fun being a little girl. You don't remember being this loved from your own parents. This just might not be so bad. Maybe you'll see if you can age normally from this age.<br />
<br />
It seemed that your bath was over too soon and Matt's mom was drying you off. She took you back into what was your room now, put a new diaper on you, and put you into pink footed pajamas. She then put you in the crib and gave you a bottle of juice which you picked up and began drinking since you were thirsty. She turned on the baby monitor, turned off the lights and left. There was a night light that came on when the lights were turned off. Soon you were fast asleep.</p>
