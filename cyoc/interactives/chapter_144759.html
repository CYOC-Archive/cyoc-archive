<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I...&quot; Your dad muttered as he stared back at you as tears formed in your eyes and you whimpered,&quot;I-I just thought w-we could be... normal... or as close as we could possibly be to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your Dad paused and took a long deep breath and sighed and proceeded to lick your tears off your face like your mother used to when you tripped and fell as a toddler when you still didn’t know where you could piss or where not to. You of course were caught off-guard by this and as you looked up at him and he chuckled,&quot;You know, you really would make a good daughter, but... only if you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I... D-Dad?&quot; You muttered confused and for the first time since you were a toddler he smiled at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;All this time, I just thought it was because something about me was defective with my genes, or your mother’s,&quot; Your Dad explained,&quot;Naturally I... well, thought you took after her far more mentally but now I know the truth. Something like this has... never happened at all in the history of our race...&quot; Your Dad then sighed and looked depressed,&quot;What will your mother think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I won’t tell her anything at all, not a single word,&quot; You replied,&quot;I’ll make sure the new hatchling doesn’t either, explain to them everything that happened since then and... well... for what it’s worth Dad out of all of this... I’m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your Dad nodded to you and said,&quot;No, it’s me who must apologize to you my son, it’s my fault all of this started in the first place.&quot; <br />
<br />
He still seemed a bit down even after your promise and apology, and even after all he did to you, you felt sad for him. So you nudged the tip of his snout and smiled at him happily and said,&quot;C&#39;mon Dad cheer up, you can still make up for all of this, make it up to me, and mom especially. She’s been stressed out about everything so much and I’m worried about the baby, and it’s not good for her, for anyone really. She’s worried you’d snap if it was a girl, and you’d do something unthinkable. I think... maybe you could go back to being that person you were when... I don’t know... maybe when I was a hatchling?&quot;<br />
<br />
As you finished this your father nodded sagely to you and looked into the cave and sighed. &quot;I’ll try my best, but... could you do your father a favor and... help me?&quot; Your Dad asked and your eyes went wide, he hadn’t asked your help for anything, and mostly just told you to get out of his way when he had a bad day as of recently. So of course you nodded to him as he got to his feet and the two of you marched back into the cave together.<br />
<br />
<br />
You stood by and watched as your dad took a deep breath before he approached the nest with your mom in it, and he nudged her to wake her. &quot;Ember, sweetheart, are you stirring?&quot; Your Dad asked and you climbed up on the side of the nest and watched as her eyes opened slowly and she yawned before she looked up at your father with a weary expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s okay Mom,&quot; You said smiling at her reassuringly,&quot;Actually, for once maybe a bit better than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your Mom looked at you puzzled and then she looked up at your Dad who you were actually caught off guard by as a large tear ran down his cheek. &quot;I... I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; He whimpered and your eyes went wide even more and he continued,&quot;... I’ve been putting you and Razor through so so much that... it’s unforgivable.... scarring....&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother’s eyes went wide too and she shook herself awake and rubbed her eyes. &quot;W-Wait... a-are you.... no... no you can’t y-you wouldn’t....!&quot; Your mother shouted and your father growled,&quot;I wouldn’t dare leave you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence befell the room as your father took another deep breath and continued,&quot;I had a discussion with Razor outside, and he brought to my attention that... everything I’ve done... it’s torturing you, Razor... and....&quot;<br />
<br />
You heard your father sobbing in his words as you watched more and more tears fall from his face as he whimpered,&quot;I’m a monster, a beast th-that... leeched off of you for the sake of pride, and pride alone. But...&quot; Your father looked at you and smiled for a moment then added,&quot;...pride isn’t everything, a-and I should broaden my own mind of what to take pride in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom tried to stand up but stumbled back a bit, and she caught herself and shook her head. &quot;A-Am I dreaming? V-Vale you...&quot; Your mom stammered out then your Dad smiled and said,&quot;I was too worked up in my own legacy that I didn’t consider the toll, I love you Ember, and I’ve changed, I’m going to focus less on training a new warrior and more on being the loving father I should’ve been all along while raising Razor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You mean it?&quot; Your mother asked looking at the honesty in your father’s eyes and then down at you, and you nodded to her and smiled. She then did something that was completely unexpected, and you nearly fell backwards onto the ground when she did this. Your mother lunged forwards and tackled your father, and the two tumbled until your father was on top of her. The two of them were kissing each other passionately, something that would make any normal pre-pubescent teenager like yourself recoil in disgust, but it seemed sweet and passionate.<br />
<br />
You smiled and watched this until you watched Dad’s hemipenes unsheathe and smelled a distinct aroma of Mom’s feminine hormones kicking in. Deciding that you were too young to watch this you closed your eyes and used the wall of the cave to guide you outside where you perched yourself on top of the cave and thought to yourself as you overlooked the surrounding land from far above your cave,&quot;I can see why Dad likes it up here... geez, they’re really getting it on too, and I’m wondering if I’ll get two siblings now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
After about 15-30 minutes, or at least you guessed considering it’s been so long since you’ve seen a clock and you forgotten how humans told time. Mom popped out of the cave and looked up at you perched atop the mouth and smiled. &quot;There you are, I was a little worried there for a second,&quot; She exclaimed and you smiled at her and said and replied,&quot;I know better,&quot; which to you always seemed to be your signature response whenever you do something that she’s proud of, or impressed by.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don’t know the half of it, Dad is... he’s exactly like he was 20,000 years ago,&quot; Your mom cheered then paused and grinned,&quot;But twice the lover~&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment you knew that you were treading on thin ice your gave her a nervous look and whined,&quot;MOOOOOM?!&quot; This happened from time to time, she often regarded you as being older than you were, and sometimes she forgot your actual age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, so how did you convince your father to... well you know... turn around like that?&quot; She asked<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Well I...&quot; You blushed a bit and said,&quot;It’s a secret unfortunately between me and him, but there’s no need to worry about it because it didn’t have anything to do with you. He just feels bad and wants to make up for all of his wrongs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that’s alright then I suppose... so I guess that the alternative plan of action is out of order then huh?&quot; Your Mom asked<br />
<br />
You paused as you always knew that the alternative plan was to turn you female and to hope to god the child was a guy. However as a teen going through puberty, and with your Dad lately you did make a few plans of what you would do as a female. Secretly even you kind of wanted to be fucked by a guy as a girl, and the thought still lingered to this day. <br />
<br />
You dicks unsheathed and your screamed as you tried to hide them from your mom, but she just laughed and said,&quot;Don’t worry, you’re going through that awkward stage we all dread so much in life, but you’re thinking about it I can tell. So have you reached a decision yet? Your father said he’s completely fine with whatever you choose, which is a first for him in a long while.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment and really figured that he might object, but no, he’d support you and your decision? You thought about it for a couple more minutes and took a deep breath and sighed,&quot;Mom... I....&quot;</p>
