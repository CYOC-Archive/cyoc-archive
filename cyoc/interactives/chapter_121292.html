<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
You look down at your hands.  You are surprised to find the same white fluffy fur covering them.  You have not changed.  You are still a bunny.  You think the spell must have failed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!?  Why am I a rat!?&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn and see another small bunny, identical to you except covered by black fur.  It is looking over its body, inspecting it.  A pile of dark, baggy clothes lay in a pile at its long thin feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not a rat, you idiot.  You are a bunny.  Can&#39;t you tell the difference?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, whatever I am, you are one, too.  Or can&#39;t you tell?&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear a gasp behind you.  You turn and see another bunny, again identical to you but covered in light blonde fur. It is freaking out, running its hands up and down its furry body.  It stumbles out of the large pile of pajamas piled at its feet.  You recognize the pajamas.  They belong to Brooke.  Then it hits you - these bunnies are Claire and Brooke.  You didn&#39;t just mess up the spell - you screwed it up royally!<br />
<br />
&quot;Augh!  What have you done to me?&quot; says Brooke, the blonde bunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;To both of us, &quot; says Claire, the black bunny.<br />
<br />
Claire glares angrily as she advances on you.  Her large feet get tripped up a little on her clothes as she stumbles out of them.  She quickly recovers, then begins to hop towards you. You hear a thumbing and turn to see Brooke hopping towards you from the other direction.  She doesn&#39;t look much happier.  Soon you find yourself surrounded by two small, cute but very angry bunnies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, take it easy.  This is just a terrible accident.  I didn&#39;t mean for this to happen...&quot; you stammer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And just what were you trying to do, you naughty bunny?&quot; says Brooke angrily.<br />
<br />
You gulp nervously.  Brooke&#39;s threatened punishments for disobedience are still fresh in your brain.  Even though you are now the same size, you still are a little hesitant to tell her the truth. You hear the sound of rustling paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;A body-swapping spell?&quot; says Claire with some confusion, as she holds up the loose sheet of paper that contained the spell.<br />
<br />
Brooke&#39;s bushy eyebrows furrowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were trying to swap bodies .....  with me!&quot; yells Brooke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for a little while.  Just so I could go back to the magic store and get my old body back.  I don&#39;t want to be your pet bunny.  I just want to be your boyfriend!&quot; you plead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Old body?  Boyfriend? Is that your boyfriend?  Did you do that to him?&quot; asks Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what if it is?   It&#39;s none of your business!&quot; says Brooke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You idiot!  I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass about you or your stupid boyfriend.  But mixing different magics is incredibly dangerous.  The results can be unpredictable, even dangerous, as you can see now, &quot; says Claire, indicating her new bunny body. &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot; <br />
<br />
You blush a little, the bright red on your cheeks a stark contrast to your white fur.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I just didn&#39;t want to be a pet for the rest of my life, &quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ungrateful little jerk.  You didn&#39;t even give it a chance. I would have been good to you.  You would have enjoyed a life of luxury, just eating and playing all day.  But no - you had to act like a little whiney baby.  I would have let you change back - after a few weeks, if you really didn&#39;t like it,&quot; says Brooke.<br />
<br />
Somehow you don&#39;t believe Brooke.  But you still feel a little guilty. You didn&#39;t even last one full day as a pet.  Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have been so bad, to have someone caring and looking after you.  Just for a little while, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, enough with couples therapy.  We don&#39;t have time for this.  We need to figure out how to change back as soon as possible.  The longer we stay like this, the more likely it is to be permanent.  Now, tell me exactly how you changed him into a bunny,&quot; says Claire.<br />
<br />
You and Brooke explain everything that happened at the store, from the magic ring to the bunny ears, including your encounter with the storekeeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cash, huh?  I hope I have enough, &quot; says Claire as she digs through her purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough cash for what?&quot; asks Brooke.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the shopkeeper, you idiot.  We can&#39;t afford that ring, but maybe we can buy something else to reverse its effect.  At the very least we can buy his knowledge.  We are gonna to need some help to untangle the crossed magics and it sounds like he is a skilled wizard,&quot; says Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go back to the store?  Like this? Are you crazy? We are helpless little bunnies.  We could get killed out there on our own!  And even if we make it the store, and somehow get inside without raising suspicion, there is no guarantee the old man will help us, regardless of how much money you bring.  More likely the old man will sell us.  Or use us as ingredients for magic spells or voodoo or something.  Aren&#39;t rabbit&#39;s feet magical or something?&quot; says Brookes, wagging one of her large feet.<br />
<br />
Claire pouts, putting her hands on her furry hips.  She looks adorable, regardless of her anger.  But you know better than to laugh and stifle the chuckles building up inside you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what is your bright idea then?&quot;  says Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could just stay here,&quot; says Brooke. &quot;Being a bunny isn&#39;t so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  That&#39;s your solution.  To just stay here and live out the rest of your life as a bunny?  What are you going to do for food and shelter? I don&#39;t think it will be easy to get jobs looking like this and I sure don&#39;t want to spend the rest of my life rooting through dumpsters - or living in one!&quot; says Claire.<br />
<br />
Brooke shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we are cute bunnies now.  I am sure one of the girls in the dorm would be happy to adopt us and care for us, &quot; says Brooke.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be somebody&#39;s pet?&quot; asks Claire<br />
<br />
&quot;Would that be so bad?  To be pampered, protected and cared for the rest of your life?&quot; says Brooke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not willing to be anyone&#39;s slave, regardless of how kind my &#39;master&#39; might be.  You can take your chances and stay here if you want, but I am out of here.  What about you?&quot; says Claire, turning to look at you.  &quot;You said you didn&#39;t want to be a pet.  It was your desperate attempt to escape that caused this whole mess.  You still willing to do whatever it takes to get back to normal?  Or do you want to hide here with her, hope for the best and spend the rest of your life as a bunny?&quot; says Claire.<br />
<br />
You look back and forth between the two bunnies.  Claire looks at you with grim determination. You are sure nothing will stop her from her goal.  You think she probably will make it to the store ..... well, maybe.  But Brooke looks at you with sad, pitiful eyes.  You can see the fear on her face. She does not want to be left alone.  And maybe she is right. Would being a pet really be so bad if you had the right owner? And the dorm was filled with many nice girls.  But was a gilded cage really any better than a prison with iron bars?<br />
<br />
Both girls look at you impatiently, waiting for your decision.  You finally decide to .....</p>
