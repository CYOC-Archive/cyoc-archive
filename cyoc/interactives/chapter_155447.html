<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day 3 and the device was there.<br />
<br />
Nobody remembered opening the door and bringing it in, just waking up in their rooms and then coming back out and seeing it right in the middle of the living room. Terry looked at Duke with a rather concerned expression, as if wondering if he&#39;d brought it in or something. Duke just shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys...I think this might be it.&quot; Jess said and walked over to the device. It looked like some sort of spherical device mounted on a pillar of some kind, with a perpetual motion clock on the top. She read from a note left by the top of the device, &quot;I am so sorry that your lives were so complicated by the Lots of Aging. I have tried to be more accountable with lives affected by magic in recent years, and so I have sent you this Aging Device. Every day it will restore 3 years of age to each of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; Duke said, and looked it over, &quot;It doesn&#39;t look so impressive...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess got it started by pressing a button on the back, the clock starting to suddenly spin much faster, her curiosity propelling her to do so. She wondered as she looked at it what was gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Sarah was the one who noted something was happening, and pointed at Terry, &quot;T-Terry, look at yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry suddenly grunted and felt his clothes getting tighter, muscles and years of gym sessions restoring to his body as the device seemed to hone in on the responsible one first, as if giving him that first selection as a reward;<br />
<br />
Terry shed his jacket and shirt as his muscles swelled with strength as he headed back into the first years of his serious workouts and football - his face broadening and strengthening, looking still remarkably boyish but strong in a way. His pecs pushed out to a great degree, but nowhere near what he once possessed. His abs sculpted into being, each one definitively showing. He flexed a bicep as he watched his arms swell with strength, matched by his broad shoulders. Terry&#39;s muscled physique was coming back to him, and he also took off his pants and stood there in straining boxers as his legs grew strength and size, glutes pushing out a bit more.<br />
<br />
Almost falling backward, Terry felt his restored muscles and somewhat shorter styled hair, and laughed, &quot;It---It worked! I&#39;m...I&#39;m 15 years old again! I&#39;m not a fucking kid! Check me out, Sarah, my muscles are back!&quot; He did some light flexing for her, and Sarah clapped...just in time for her to get hit with it next.<br />
<br />
She grew into her teenage years right, her looks starting to restore to her as athletic curves and growth began to return to her. She left the awkwardness of her early tween years and proceeded to what Terry remembered, on her way to becoming the girl he&#39;d pined for in high school. Sarah gasped as she felt her breasts growing back in - though nowhere near what they were soon to be in a matter of days.<br />
<br />
Once her changes were done, Duke&#39;s began.<br />
<br />
Duke gasped and pressed himself against one of the walls, feeling his body aging and developing - if he&#39;d thought his hormones were crazy at that age of 12, developing back into fifteen woke him up to how he really was at that age. Duke groaned and ripped away his clothes in a frenzy, one hand feeling his restoring musculature while the other tweaked a nipple, which made him giggle and groan outloud. His body was strengthening - his biceps and triceps were strong, strong again! His legs were those of a young quarterback! His chest and abdominals strengthened and toned back up. Duke was never as big as Terry was, but he was a heartthrob through and through - becoming a handsome young man about to grow into even greater looks.<br />
<br />
Duke looked at Jess and then at Terry, &quot;M-My fucking God! I thought it was crazy earlier! I feel...I feel like I could explode! F-Fuck, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke&#39;s eyes went to Jess as she underwent the transformation last but not least. Restoring to a young teen cheerleader, she drew Duke&#39;s gaze as her body matured and developed, each bit leaving tween years behind as she started the trek back toward older years. Her breasts caught his eye and her long hair returned, which Duke very much remembered from these years. Thankfully, she&#39;d been wearing very loose clothes that day, so she and likewise Sarah hadn&#39;t needed to frantically move like that.<br />
<br />
Each of them moving over next to each other, Terry smiled widely, &quot;I-I almost can&#39;t believe it worked! We&#39;re 15! I&#39;ve got my muscles again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke moved over and slapped Terry&#39;s ass, &quot;Tell me about it, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry returned the favor, and slapped Duke&#39;s ass even harder, making the young man squeal and moan outloud from the contact.<br />
<br />
Sarah chuckled, &quot;Terry...Duke...hands to yourselves! Haah, though honestly, I can&#39;t blame you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess commentated, &quot;Glad to see you&#39;re...&quot; She said looking at Duke, &quot;Feeling more open about yourself. Being repressed is a terrible thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke turned bright red for a moment and looked to the side, though he didn&#39;t regret what he was doing now. He didn&#39;t intend to go forward without acting at least a little on these parts of himself he&#39;d discovered through these events. &quot;Just so you know...I&#39;m...I&#39;m not gay or anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded, &quot;We know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry grinned, &quot;We&#39;re all okay with you no matter what label or concept you associate yourself with, Duke. You&#39;re you, and that&#39;s what matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess then said, &quot;Now, sweet as all this is, I don&#39;t think we should have to sit back and just wait for it to age us to our preferred ages. Let&#39;s see what we can do today, okay guys?&quot;</p>
