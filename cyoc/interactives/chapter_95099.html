<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ah, Lawrence!&quot; he heard from a booming voice down the hall. It was Mr. Johnston, his biology teacher from second period. Lawrence breathed a sigh of relief, realizing it wasn&#39;t a group of students he would have to speak to. He approached Mr. Johnston and saw a couple of other teachers with him, Mrs. Tarn, another biology teacher, and Mr. Paxton, a physics teacher.<br />
<br />
Lawrence approached the teachers, and replied with a cheerful &quot;Hello Mr. Johnston!&quot;. Mr. Johnston was Lawrence&#39;s favorite teacher, and Lawrence often stayed after his classes to discuss things with him. It was strange when Mr. Johnston didn&#39;t reply to him, just kind of staring off into space. Lawrence was weirded out, and said hello to Mrs. Tarn and Mr. Paxton, but they also failed to acknowledge him, rather staring off into the distance. Lawrence looked off to see what they were looking at, but couldn&#39;t find anything. He noticed the people in the background of his vision also weren&#39;t moving. Something weird was going on.<br />
<br />
As Lawrence tried to move from his spot towards the office he felt a sharp pain in his ring finger under where he&#39;d slipped on the ring. It was almost like a tightness where the ring was. He examined his hand, and watched as his digits thickened, growing fat. His hands grew larger and meatier, as the ring got tighter. Suddenly, the red marks by where the tight ring was faded as the ring grew to fit his new huge hands. Lawrence was mortified at what had just happened, seeing his hands just grow so huge all of a sudden. But looking at them, they seemed normal. He&#39;d always had huge hands, they were perfect for throwing and catching balls. Lawrence shook his head at that alien thought, as he turned to the teachers again.<br />
<br />
The teachers were still not acknowledging anything, just kind of staring off into space. Lawrence was frustrated, what was going on with people today? He felt a sweltering heat all of a sudden, like the sun was beating down through the roof. Lawrence wicked the sweat off his head, as he felt really thin hairs on his forehead where somewhat long bangs used to lie. He set his big hands on his head again, and felt his smooth bald dome. He rubbed it, trying to get the sweat off. Lawrence laughed, he hadn&#39;t had hair in years. But wasn&#39;t he a student here? The thoughts running rampant through Lawrence&#39;s head were hurting his brain.<br />
<br />
Lawrence looked up at the other teachers, seeing them still in their daze. Suddenly, they stared growing shorter as Lawrence watched them. He looked around the hallway, it wasn&#39;t just the teachers that were growing shorter, it was the entire building. Wait, was he getting taller? That didn&#39;t make sense. Lawrence looked down at the other teachers, he was a bit taller than them. But he&#39;d always been tall growing up, standing at a solid 6&#39;5 now he was definitely taller than your average person. He looked ridiculous in his hall monitor clothing though. <br />
<br />
Lawrence felt a surge of power all of a sudden from his gut, like he felt strong and masculine. He started to flex in place, as firm muscles started to replace his pudgy figure. His stomach deflated inwards as powerful 6 pack abs replaced them, and his pecs became strong and defined. His legs and arms became strong and fit, like they belonged to a man who was dedicated to the gym. But of course Lawrence was dedicated to the gym, he literally worked in one. He knew it was important to be fit if you were to teach kids the importance of fitness.<br />
<br />
The colossal man stretched, as his clothing changed on him. His black dress socks became a pair of crew cut athletic white socks, and his loafers became a pair of gym sneakers. The fabric of his jeans shifted into a mesh, as the legs grew shorter, resting at just below his kneecaps. The color turned into a deep blue, nothing like the denim blue of the jeans they once were. His white briefs morphed and changed into a pair of black boxerjocks. His green tshirt changed into the same mesh material as the gym shorts and became a pristine white, as it became an athletic shirt. The gym teacher stood in the hallway, wearing an out of place hall monitor sash. The sash started to thin out as it became a brown rope, except for the end where it bulged out. A little silver whistle morphed out of the end of the sash and it hung from around his neck on the rope.<br />
<br />
Mr. Lorenz smiled at the other teachers. &quot;So yeah, I think it would be a good idea to work together and create a physiology course for next year.&quot; he suggested<br />
Mr. Johnston nodded, &quot;It&#39;s true, it brings all of our work together and the kids could learn a lot from it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s discuss this more in the teacher&#39;s lounge.&quot; said Mr. Lorenz, as the teachers walked towards the lounge. The ring dropped off of Mr. Lorenz&#39;s finger, unaware to the new gym teacher. Who would find it next?</p>
