<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That statement kind of upset me.  It wasn't her tone so much.  It was more like she gave me the impression she didn't know how things could be better for us.  I sure did, and it wasn't just about there being a sex life between us.  I wanted us to take our entire relationship further.  It seemed to me that maybe she didn't feel the same way.  That bothered me.  It wasn't as if we had to get to know each other.  We had to make the leap from friends to lovers.  I figured there was probably only one way to do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I lied.  &quot;We could make it so that we had better jobs, or that we would have enough money that we didn't need to work.  We could have bigger homes, or something.&quot;  She sighed at me and kind of rolled her eyes.  I didn't need her to say anything.  I knew what she was thinking.  &quot;I know, I know, it's all material.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; she said.  &quot;Wishing for a better lifestyle for ourselves isn't going to help us figure out how to help others.&quot;<br />
<br />
I knew she was right, but at this point in time, I didn't know what else we could do.  Actually, I thought to myself, I knew exactly what I could wish for, but it would mean breaking the promise I made to myself one way or another.  <br />
<br />
She got up and paced around the room, her hands on her hips.  It gave me a chance to focus myself on her completely.  She had such a great figure.  She never gave herself any credit for it, either, as if she was afraid of it in some way.  Actually there was a reason for that, but I didn't want to think of unpleasant memories from the past.  <br />
<br />
Becky had shoulder-length blonde hair.  It wasn't cut too short that it looked boyish.  It suited her pretty well.  She had grown her hair longer when she was younger, but it never seemed to suit her.  She was 5'10&quot; and I no idea what she weighed.  It wasn't my business to know.  All I had to know by looking at her was that I could tell she wasn't overweight, and she wasn't dangerously thin either.  She looked exactly how a woman should look, by having the perfect hour-glass figure.  Her breasts were also a good size.  They were probably C or D cup size.  Again I wasn't sure, though I could tell that the ones I sported right now were bigger than hers.  I wondered if that made her jealous.  I hoped not because I didn't want to think she might be superficial about something like that.  The rest of her was everything that you could ask for, too, with shapely legs and a well-rounded ass.<br />
<br />
As she continued to pace, I could feel myself getting aroused just thinking about her beauty.  Not only was my cock getting hard, but so were my nipples.  She'd notice at least some of that and I did not want her to notice.  I made another silent wish that my arousal wouldn't be visually obvious.  The results of this wish were strange.  I couldn't see my cock getting bigger underneath my jeans and my nipples weren't erect anymore, either, but I could still feel them being very aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you looking at your chest so intently?&quot; she asked, snapping me out of my thoughts.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked, taken aback by her question.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been staring at your tits for the past minute,&quot; she said.  Had it really been that long, I wondered.  I also found it funny how she said the phrase &quot;my tits.&quot;  She said it with slight disgust in her voice, and yet, I thought I detected a hint of jealousy in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said.  &quot;Guess I'm still shocked myself that I have them.&quot;  She didn't respond and just kept pacing.  I decided to push her buttons and said, &quot;Well you must have been looking at them too if you knew how long I was looking at them.&quot;  She just stuck her tongue out at me, in a joking manner, and kept pacing.  Wow, I thought to myself.  That was her normal defense mechanism when she had been pushed.  I must have been partially right.<br />
<br />
That settled it, I thought.  Despite not wanting to alter her or force her into anything, I knew we weren't getting anywhere unless I used the ring on her in some way.  Suddenly an idea hit me that was so bizarre, but so impishly clever that I could not resist to utilize it.  I wished, silently again, that her clothes would slowly disappear from her body, going from bottom to top, and that she would not notice that anything was happening to her.<br />
<br />
I stared down at her feet, waiting for the first signs of my wish.  I knew the wish was working when she was walking away from me and I could see the bottoms of her feet.  With each continued step, her shoes faded into nothingness.  In a moment her feet were completely bare and the bottom of her pant legs also began to disappear.  It was as if someone was slowly taking a pencil eraser to the fabric.  I could see her calves and eventually her knees, as it now appeared she was wearing a pair of shorts.  <br />
<br />
I tried my best to hide my sense of satisfaction, but I could not disguise my expression that well with Becky.  She stopped walking and looked at me.  &quot;What are you grinning about?&quot; she demanded.  &quot;Did you think of something?&quot; she said as her pants were now nothing more than the shortest of shorts.  <br />
<br />
I could still feel the extreme state of arousal that I was in and hoped I would be able to contain it.  After all, I knew what I'd get to see in a moment.  She still had no idea what was happening.  In fact, she still had her hands on her hips, and if she kept them there, they would soon be feeling bare skin and not fabric.  &quot;No, no thought,&quot; I said.  &quot;Except that you're the most beautiful women I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her expression softened.  &quot;Well, that came out of nowhere,&quot; she said.  &quot;But I certainly appreciate the compliment.&quot;  Her pants now began to disappear across her genital region.  I got my first glimpse of her womanhood in all of its glory.  I must admit I had two thoughts at this point.  One was a feeling of satisfaction of finally being able to see hers, and the other was wonder of what it would be like to have what she had rather than what I had.  After all, I did have breasts now.<br />
<br />
She still did notice that her clothes were unraveling.  Her hands shifted directly onto her bare hips without so much of a bat of the eye.  And she still didn't know that I was gazing upon her hairless pussy.  I stifled a chuckle as I found it funny she would do that.  But what did I know about female grooming?<br />
<br />
Becky continued to pace back and forth, giving me a tremendous view of her awesome ass.  It was perfectly rounded and the cheeks appeared to be soft, but still incredibly firm.  I guessed she definitely exercised more than I ever thought she did.<br />
<br />
Her shirt, and eventually her bra, I presumed, now suffered the same fate as her pants and shoes.  Her flat stomach was now exposed to the open air, showing off her cute, little belly button.  As the shirt shrank away more, it looked like she was wearing a bikini top that had sleeves and wasn't low cut.  <br />
<br />
As her shirt crept closer to revealing her breasts, I knew that I would not be able to control myself.  To prevent any further complications, I wished that I wouldn't have an orgasm due to her clothes disappearing, but that I would retain my level of arousal.  I thought that this was a clever wish since it would allow me to enjoy the continuing show without losing control of myself.<br />
<br />
She stopped walking again and turned back to look at me.  Her timing was impeccable as she looked at me just as the shirt started to reveal her breasts.  I was completely awestruck.  There she was, standing naked from the chest down, and soon she would be completely naked.  And I had to somehow make it look like I wasn't staring at her chest.  &quot;Well, I can't think of anything,&quot; she said, as her the bottoms of her breasts came into view.  &quot;What about you?&quot; she asked as the shirt reached the center of her breasts, showing me her nipples.<br />
<br />
When I saw her nipples, I was surprised.  They were completely erect.  For some reason, I had not noticed that before her shirt disappeared.  Her breasts were now completely uncovered and all that remained of the shirt was the collar and the tops of the sleeves.  They quickly vanished, too, leaving her as naked as the day she was born.  She was, of course, much better looking that she was on that particular day.  <br />
<br />
Now was the time I had to spring the reality upon her.  &quot;Yes, I've thought of something,&quot; I said.  &quot;Becky, if we're going to do this, we have to take the next step.  We have to have sex.&quot;  I waited for her expression to change into a frown or scowl or anything negative, but before I would let that happen, I wished that she realized she was standing before me naked.<br />
<br />
She shook her head slightly, then looked down at her naked body and immediately shrieked.  &quot;AAAAAHHH!  WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?&quot; she screamed as she frantically tried to cover herself with her hands.</p>
