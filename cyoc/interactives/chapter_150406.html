<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Turner took a deep breath as he looked up at the large building that he was going to be residing in for a week. All manner of strange creatures entered and exited the building and it seemed packed.<br />
<br />
He had taken the bus here, since he had recently sold off his car since he couldn&#39;t afford to pay for it anymore. His son had chosen to take a different bus than him, so he hadn&#39;t even been able to check if his son had made it there alright. Sam wasn&#39;t picking up any of his calls either so he was in the dark. <br />
<br />
He kept his head low and facing the floor, as he entered the building, doing his best to seem small and unimportant. It&#39;s what got him through his longer work days without getting harassed by his boss or coworkers and he figured it would help him here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so YOU&#39;RE the father!&quot; Came a bubbly voice and Mr. Turner looked up to see an incredibly beautiful woman walking over towards him with a wide smile. She was obviously another monster given the wings and spade tail on her back. <br />
<br />
He blinked, unprepared as she smothered him in a giant hug, one that pressed her breasts up against him. Instantly he felt himself get aroused, something he hadn&#39;t done since-<br />
<br />
Ah, well that was a mood killer.<br />
<br />
To her apparent surprise, he pushed her away and adjusted his glasses, giving her a rather tired look. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She blinked and looked a little disappointed. &quot;I&#39;m Candi, honey. I&#39;m the first succubus on record and I&#39;m here to help you along with your transition.&quot; She studied his face. &quot;Are you not Sam&#39;s father? Will Turner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Turner just nodded, his eyes glazing over. Fuck. He knew he should&#39;ve tried to get some coffee before coming here. He felt as though he was going to collapse at any moment.<br />
<br />
Candi noticed. &quot;Would you… like to get some coffee?&quot; she offered. &quot;There&#39;s a cafe in the building. I can show you how to get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Relieved he nodded. &quot;Yes, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
___<br />
<br />
The cafe wasn&#39;t far thankfully and it was pretty empty. The two sat down at a table near the windows. Once they had sat down, Will pulled out a small laptop and opened it up.<br />
<br />
Candi frowned. &quot;Why the laptop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will smiled apologetically. &quot;I managed to get a week off for this thanks to the government&#39;s help, but my boss still wants me to do some work while I&#39;m here. I spent most of the might making sure I did a good chunk of it, so I wouldn&#39;t have to do it here.&quot; He took a swig of the coffee before letting out a sigh. He could already feel some energy returning to his body. &quot;So you know Sam?&quot; he asked, turning to face Candi. As he did, he thought he caught a glimpse of pity on her face, but it quickly disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; she nodded with a bright smile. &quot;Always nice to meet another fan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will didn&#39;t know what she meant, so he just nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I met him a couple of hours ago in the youth center, but I also wanted to meet you, so I drove here as fast as I could.&quot; She giggled. &quot;It&#39;s quite a tenuous schedule for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Turner just gave a strained laugh. &quot;Sounds like it,&quot; he said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a woman before the change, so I don&#39;t fully know what you two are going through.&quot; She clasped his hand within her own, making him blush. &quot;Do you have any other children? A wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, another mood killer. He pulled his hand away from her. &quot;Only Sam,&quot; he said shortly. &quot;My wife died in a car crash three years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Candi placed a hand on her cheek and bit her lip. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was being callous.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head. &quot;Don&#39;t be. You didn&#39;t know after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candi studied him. &quot;Are you feeling alright? Are you scared? I can&#39;t understand what you might be going through changing genders like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m more worried about Sam,&quot; he confessed. &quot;I just can&#39;t ever tell what he&#39;s thinking, anymore. I&#39;ll be fine as long as I can keep my current job as a programmer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candi eyes his laptop carefully. &quot;Mr. Turner, if I may be frank, are you unhappy with your current job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered immediately. &quot;But it&#39;s the only one I have. If I&#39;m fired then I&#39;m not going to be able to afford our apartment anymore. New York City is an expensive place to live.&quot; <br />
<br />
Candi pulled a business card out from between her breasts. &quot;If you want,&quot; she said handing him the card. &quot;I can put in a good word with my producer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Producer?&quot; Will asked, taking the card.<br />
<br />
Candi nodded. &quot;I work as a porn star,&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
Will&#39;s stomach dropped. &quot;You want… me to work as a porn star?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candi just shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s up to you. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll pay more than your current job.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t,&quot; he said firmly. <br />
<br />
Candi smiled ruefully. &quot;Well, just take the card in case you change your mind. I thought the same thing before my change. I was a professor of biology at UF, before my change. But now that I&#39;ve made my choice I couldn&#39;t be happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Politely, Mr. Turner placed the card in his pocket. &quot;It was nice meeting you Miss…?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Candi White.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss White.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likewise.&quot; She pulled him into a hug, pressing her breasts into her face. She pulled away and winked. &quot;I&#39;m excited to have another couple of sisters! My number is on the card too.&quot; She gave him a wave and walked away. &quot;You&#39;d better get to orientation!&quot; she called to him, before disappearing into the crowded hallway.<br />
<br />
Mr. Turner waved back, before massaging his temples. Time to get back to work.</p>
