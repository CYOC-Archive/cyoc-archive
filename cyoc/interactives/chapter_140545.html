<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas walked in the middle of the main hallway of the house, stopping to admire or evaluate some of the painting or figurines exposed all over the aisle. All the pieces depicted well-endowed women in different stages of undress, some posed completely nude in alluring positions with sultry smiles, while other danced and played with the other characters in an erotic display, hinting with their smoldering eyes about the pleasures they will experience in the near future.<br />
<br />
All in all almost all the art pieces in the room had a common theme that easily tied all the works together, there was no identifiable male everywhere and all the girl were in the throes of passion. Even in the painting featuring sex of some kind the protagonists were horny girls, pleasuring their lovers with clear use of tongue or fingers, while the more daring sported a menacing strap-on dildo plunged in the vagina of their partners. <br />
<br />
“Well, from what I can see the previous owner was very interested in the female form…” Lucas stammered with a blush as he passed a particularly vivid rendering of an animated orgy between five beauties, all the while the unnoticed pink smoke trailed on the side, giggling from time to time after the ghost noticed the bulge inside the boy’s pants.<br />
<br />
Acknowledging that the man was ready the spirit slipped inside a nearby room, rattling a nearby cabinet and alerting Lucas, that jerked in that direction.<br />
<br />
“Guys? Someone there?”<br />
<br />
The boy entered cautiously in the chamber, recognizable from the various furniture as the dinner room, before noticing how every furnishings were moved by someone along the walls, leaving only an ornate carpet in the middle of the chamber. While Lucas searched the area where the noise originated his eyes caught a shimmer on the table, and a closer inspection revealed a golden ring positioned on the back of the table, almost touching the wall.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, is that really what I think it is? It must be my lucky day” The man approached the wooden table to pick the unexpected and valuable jewellery, pleased by his find, when the boy noticed how he was unable to reach with his hands this treasure, without completely leaning against the table or climbing on top of it.<br />
<br />
The outline of a voluptuous woman formed from the pink smoke existing in the room behind him, and an insidious voice whispered in his ears “Come on Lucas, don’t you want the ring? All you have to do is to lean down to pick it up, something like this ring can be sold for quite the sum…”<br />
<br />
Convinced and completely missing the fact that he was alone until seconds before the man laid his chest on the hard surface, stretching dutifully to snag the prize as the mist pounced on the unassuming boy. Tendrils of pink mist emerged from the floor near his feet, coiling around the ankles and anchoring to the ground the soles of his shoes. Manacles formed from hard wood snagged the hands that even now tried to reach the gold ring and merged with the wooden surface restraining Lucas, that only after he was unable to move his arms noticed how even his legs were pinned by something.<br />
<br />
Completely tied to the furniture and incapable of free himself the man struggled in his bonds anyway, an exercise of futility as Lucas fell in a trap that claimed many men that previously entered the mansion with curiosity and greed, only to find a bra and a pair of panties specifically reserved for them. The spirit admired his handiwork for a few moments, then spread the pink smoke toward the bound male, that even now was obvious to the second entity in the room.<br />
<br />
Like a conductor the mysterious woman directed the changes in the body and clothes of her captive, starting with the face and hair of Lucas, lengthening his brown hair until they reached the middle of his back, while she modified his masculine face to assume more soft features, cheeks more chubby  and inviting, a small and perky nose and a mouth with plump and kissable lips.<br />
<br />
The midsection was the next as his shirt morphed in a black blouse and bra, his breasts grew under her gaze to reach a remarkable D-cup and pressed salaciously along the wood, leaving nothing to the imagination, while the hard earned muscles that defined his status as an athletic person melted like ice cream left under the sun, leaving behind only a slim waist and unmarred , soft skin. As the transformation progressed the arms and hands were not left alone, his nails lengthened, hands became slender and tapered, while the arms lost all muscles and ended up weak and frails, befitting of a girl that in her life didn’t see much physical labor.<br />
<br />
His pants and lower regions were the last, the pants transformed in a short skirt that left nothing to the imagination while the boxer dissolved into thin air, exposing his crotch area for all to see. The ghost made a disappointed sound when her gaze locked in his hips, so thick and unrefined, and with soft caresses she shaped and inflated her budding bottom, that with every moment gained smoothness and bulk. The pink smoke hummed appreciatively when his bottom finished the changes, assuming an hearth-shaped form, before inspecting with a critical eye the last thing that tied the man to his previous gender: his manhood.<br />
<br />
Gathering a fistful of feminine smoke in her hands the spirit finished the work of her new creation, rubbing the entire length of his erect member until the cock was smeared completely.  With a smile the spirit witnessed how the proud symbol of masculinity withered like a flower, sinking deeper and deeper with her every touch, in the blooming slit that opened in its base. Inch by inch the cock slid inside him, until finally only a sensitive nub remained, and along his manhood even his now useless balls entered the shifting folds to reshape themselves in a pair of ovaries and finalizing the transformation.<br />
<br />
 A soft breeze caressed the bare bottom and exposed vagina of the brunette that Lucas turned into and the girl shuddered, then with a rattled and clearly feminine voice called for help, since the bindings adapted to her changes and was still unable to escape the trap alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys! Help, I&#39;m stuck here!&quot; Her voluptous breasts were squished against the surface with every breath, and with a softer and smoother tone of voice he added &quot;And i think i&#39;m dreaming or hallucinating because this is not possib-&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas jerked when the ethereal finger of the spirit traced slowly the mound of her new pussy, the newly transformed girl unaccustomed but aroused by the sensation, even if she still had the mind of a male, before turning with a recognizable grin to hunt the next victim of the bimbo house…</p>
