<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff doubled over in sudden pain as his insides shuddered violently. &quot;Aghh!&quot;<br />
&quot;You were a freshmen right?&quot; Rick asked, &quot;Eh, I guess it doesn&#39;t really matter. I wasn&#39;t really paying attention anyway. I&#39;ll see you when you&#39;re done Jeff.&quot; Rick handed Jeff&#39;s phone back and started walking away.<br />
&quot;What do you mean &quot;were&quot;? I&#39;m a sophomore!&quot; Jeff cried<br />
Rick laughed &quot;Great, the fake ID will be more realistic. See you at lunch.&quot;<br />
Jeff frantically entered his phone password but as he looked at the screen the letters didn&#39;t seem to make words. he stared until he started to get a headache which only took a minute, before eventually giving up. He was late to class anyway. <br />
Much to his frustration class wasn&#39;t any better. He got stares as he entered and despite apologizing the teacher had a tone, like Jeff was some delinquent as opposed to running late.<br />
Jeff found it hard to concentrate, the teachers notes on the white board were even harder to read than the text on his phone. Did Rick give him poor eyesight? He looked around, his vision was clear as ever, but letters, god they did a number on his head.<br />
&quot;MR. HODGES!&quot; the teacher yelled.<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Jeff replied, partially out of alarm and partially because 20 minutes of trying to decipher the board gave him a pounding migraine. <br />
&quot;What currency called was introduced to Greece 6th century?&quot; the teacher asked.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, the Grecian dollar?&quot; Hands flung into the air and kids started laughing.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s written on the board right behind me Jeff, what&#39;s this word?&quot;<br />
Jeff looked, but the letters moved around, when they finally settled, &quot;Dracula? I thought he was Transylvanian, not Greekish.&quot;<br />
&quot;If you are going to make a mockery of my class, you can leave.&quot;<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
&quot;Just go Mr. Hodges.&quot;<br />
Jeff was shocked, he&#39;d never been turned away from a teacher before! More stifled giggles rippled throughout the class and he turned bright red... Collecting his few items and what little remained of his dignity he left the classroom and replaced his items in his locker before retreating to the bathroom to evade any hall monitors.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me today? And what&#39;s wrong with everyone else today? Maybe coach will let me in the weight room.&quot; Jeff stared in the mirror but his reflection seemed off. His hair? His face? His stubble was thick but that was why he joined sports in the first place, it raises test-toaster-something and makes you manly, and he was manly. Plus he was late today and forgot to shave. Right, something was wrong... his phone app, it&#39;s doing something to him and he needs to stop it.<br />
<br />
The bell rang and classes were shifting. Jeff needed someone he could trust, but his friends are in class or out, and any teacher he knows is teaching. After a minute he realized he could go to the office and see the Guidance Counselor. It&#39;s their job to help! After waiting for the bell to ring and the hall to clear, Jeff made his way to the office and asked to see the counselor. After a wait he was admitted to the office and after a greeting. &quot;Hey, Jeff? What brings you to my office today?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have this phone app and I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s wrong about what it says, or really even read it, so I was wondering if you could help me figure out what&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; Jeff handed him the phone not realizing his birth year password was now 3 years earlier than a few hours ago. &quot;What does it say?&quot;<br />
<br />
The counselor looked at the app, &quot;Okay, it says Jeff Hodges, It gives your height, weight, age, it says Severely Dyslexic, Amazingly stu..., we don&#39;t like to use that word Jeff. You know what they say about the fish right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, it doesn&#39;t run well.&quot;<br />
&quot;The saying is that if you try to see how well it can climb a tree, it won&#39;t get a good grade.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you get my point right?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was the one trying to make the... never mind, moving on. Best friend, Richard Sanchez&quot;<br />
&quot;He doesn&#39;t like to be called Richard, call him Rick.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just reading off the screen.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, but call him Rick.&quot; Jeff insisted.<br />
&quot;Okay, I will, the next line says no will or goals of his own and wants to be led by Richa... Rick Sanchez... Next is, super handsome but to stupid to realize he&#39;s being hit on.&quot; The counselor paused, &quot;who wrote this?&quot; <br />
&quot;Rick did.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you agree with these statements?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. This test is starting to get difficult, can you call Rick to come in and help me with it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Next line, Himbo followed by, peni... oh!&quot; he scrolled a few more lines, &quot;Oh God. The good lord taketh and the good lord giveth. Jesus. Um... the information contained in that app is inappropriate for school. You shouldn&#39;t have it here, and shouldn&#39;t show that to anyone when you&#39;re a student, until... the end of this semester when you will...&quot; He licked his lips. &quot;age out, or graduate.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m gonna have lunch now so I can see Rick.&quot;<br />
&quot;Its barely after 10.&quot;<br />
&quot;Rick said he&#39;d see me at lunch, so I&#39;m going to eat lunch, then Rick will show up.&quot;<br />
The handsome 26 year old counselor couldn&#39;t help but notice the massive outline of Jeff&#39;s obnoxious endowment as Jeff left, he wasn&#39;t gay but god did he want to try to wrap his mouth around that cock so bad! <br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s final modification was that anyone more handsome than Rick in Jeff&#39;s presence would turn gay for Jeff. Rick held no qualms over sacrificing Jeff for sexual favors.<br />
<br />
Some time later as Jeff could no longer read non-digital clocks and his general grasp on time was nebulous at best, the lunch room filled with students and Rick showed up. &quot;Dang Jeff, look at you. You turned into a beast!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hi Rick, I&#39;m human, aren&#39;t I?&quot; <br />
Rick who didn&#39;t know quite what to expect from &quot;Amazingly Stupid&quot; was pleasantly surprised. He reached out his and to touch his creations stubbled face, &quot;Yes Jeff. You are human and you&#39;re perfect, better than I even expected.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aww, thanks Rick, I like you too.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to be the perfect replacement for Freddie. His stupid parents moved him away to find a &#39;better environment.&#39; Well, I don&#39;t need him, not when I have you. Your the perfect lackey, strong, loyal, free of any ideas...&quot;<br />
&quot;Aww, thanks Rick, you&#39;re the perfect, uhh, what was that word?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothin&#39; Jeff. Lets get out of here. This place feels too small for us now. Say, do you got your phone on you? I don&#39;t want you to lose it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, good thinking Rick, you&#39;d better hold onto it so I don&#39;t forget it somewhere.&quot;</p>
