<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jo decided to go home to make some adjustments. So, she began to &quot;walk&quot; towards the bus stop when she noticed that her earlier wish about going barefoot everywhere was still in effect so to speak, as she still didn&#39;t feel the unpleasant heat of the sand as she slid across it on her tail. The same was true when she &quot;stepped&quot; onto the pavement on her way to the bus stop. She climbed on the bus by using her fin to lift her tail onto the bus. Even though it was her first time doing so, she did it as if it was second nature to her. She took a seat, amusing herself with the thought that she, a mermaid, was sitting alongside these people and they didn&#39;t even know. She then moved her hands to the hidden slit in her tail and started to gently stroke her clit more or less the same way she did from when she was traveling to the beach, but somehow the pleasure she received was more intense compared to when she was human. She quickly stopped rubbing her clit and decided to wait until she had come home before trying to masturbate again.<br />
<br />
When she finally reached the bus stop closest to her house, she got off the bus and began &quot;walking&quot; home. When she reached the front door and tried to open it, she found that the door was locked. It was then she remembered that both the keys to her house and her wallet were left behind when she stripped naked in front of Catherine. So, she held out her arms and said: &quot;I wish that my clothes I was wearing before was in my arms and my wallet and keys are where I last left them.&quot; and seconds later, her old clothes, including underwear, keys, and wallet, suddenly appeared in her arms. Jo took out her keys from her pants (which naturally were useless now that she had a fishtail instead of legs) and unlocked the front door. Once she was inside, she threw her old clothes onto the living room sofa and closed the front door behind her. &quot;Now then,&quot; she said, &quot;where to begin? Oh, I know! I first wish that starting tomorrow, everyone will notice that I am a mermaid. Everyone will believe that I&#39;ve always been a mermaid and will not treat me any differently from when I was a human. Secondly, I wish I had a swimming pool in my backyard. Thirdly, I wish that I owned no human clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as she finished her wish, she saw her old clothes on the living room sofa vanish into thin air. Jo then &quot;walked&quot; towards a window that pointed towards the backyard and she was delighted to see a large swimming pool there. &quot;It will be fun to swim in it,&quot; she thought to herself. When she was done looking at her new pool, Jo &quot;walked&quot; back towards the sofa and sat on it. As she sat there, she laughed gleefully as she willed her tail to move, watching it rise as one succinct limb. She looked at it, in all its glory, focusing now on her tailfin as it began to stretch outwards, inching ever wider as she continued testing the limits of its flexibility. It was an entirely new sensation than moving her legs simultaneously, this was… this was different. She brought her tail down, faster than she had intended as it slammed against the ground in response. A loud, almost comedic slap was heard when her fin hit the floor. However even this small mistake left her bewildered as her entire tail rippled together as one, muscles, scales, and all, the whole experience had left her with a smile so wide her cheeks hurt. She was so amused she smacked it of her own accord while it lay on the ground, just to watch her tail move. Jo took her fingers and once more ran them down her body. She smiled to herself as she felt the boundary between her human skin and the scaly flesh of a fish. She couldn’t help but squeal out loud in joy. “Oooh! I love these scales!” she said. Curiosity soon got the better of her and she grasped a single one beneath her fingertips and tugged, wincing in pain as it was plucked from her flesh. As much as it hurt, she relished the feeling, for it was yet another confirmation that this was really happening. She held her scale up high in the air, twirling her hand around as she observed if from all angles. No longer did she have feet, no longer did she have legs, she had a fishtail she can &quot;walk&quot; and &quot;stand&quot; on. But as she sat there admiring her tail, she realized that she wanted to make more changes to her house and she knew what room to modify first, namely...</p>
