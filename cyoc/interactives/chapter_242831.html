<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Sheila left, Kyle continued to struggle as his now overly sexed body finished in the kitchen, Sheila&#39;s clothes had adjusted when her body drastically changed, hugging it&#39;s figure tightly and leaving nothing to the imagination. Kyle&#39;s vision spun as his new master turned and started down the hall, her every step sending her curves jiggling wildly, he reeled from the feelings of her movements. <br />
<br />
“STOP! JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE!” He shouted as his body continued to go about it&#39;s business on autopilot, she gathered the clothes that were his this morning in a basket, then collected his new dirty clothing. She began the laundry and started cleaning the living room, he swore that she was exaggerating her movements as she did so just to torture him. It was an hour later that Kyle heard a alarm go off, she stopped and bounced down the hall, her mammoth breasts jiggling wildly as she bounced into the bedroom. She gathered a couple of cameras and surrounded her bed, pulling out a laptop she connected the cameras and opened a streaming site. <br />
<br />
Kyle watched in horror as she created a new account, HeadSwapMilf and wrote the description, “Help Me! I&#39;ve been head swapped onto my mom&#39;s sexy body and I can&#39;t control it! Somebody Help!” She then started to add price ranges, the prices ranged from one to fifty dollars, they seemed to refer to amounts of time? He panicked, trying to stop her as she got up before starting the stream, and rummaged through her pantie drawer, she grabbed something and pulled it out. Kyle stared at the insertable vibrator, it had two parts, the first was for her pussy, the second was a usb cord connected to a black orb, he wasn&#39;t sure what it did, but he was going to find out.<br />
<br />
She pulled off her clothes leaving her luscious curves exposed, stripping down to just her panties, she got back on the bed and turned around. The camera on the laptop showed Kyle a surreal sight, his head on the body of a woman who shouldn&#39;t be real, her waist was waspish, her hips and breasts gave her an hourglass figure that only cartoon characters had, her breasts were the size of basketballs. He shivered as she put the vibrator into her pussy, he felt it slide in, he whimpered as she leaned in and started her stream. She messaged her breasts, danced here and there, wiggling enough to make her body jiggle, she leaned in and typed things to the chat as she did so. After ten minutes Kyle felt it, the first vibration, “NO! DON&#39;T DO THIS!” He shouted, the chat lit up as he felt the vibrator come to life, her body shivering as she typed, she continued to antagonize the chat, begging them for more as he moaned and cried. <br />
<br />
“MMMmmmhhh five minutes babe? Sure.” Kyle heard a sound clip from the computer as the vibrator started to get more intense, he stared to drool as they climaxed, gasping and moaning he felt terror and intestacy like never before, her legs straddled the bed, she groped her breasts as the camera shifted perspective for a top down view. The viewers watched as Kyle&#39;s head writhed back and forth, lost in the fog of climaxing again and again as the vibration continued relentlessly. It finally subsided after the half hour, a beeping sound was heard as Kyle panted, trying to catch his breath. He finally collected himself as he heard another sound clip. “OOOOOHHhhhhh, Yeeesssss. Thirty Minutes. Just what mommy wanted!”<br />
<br />
“NO! STOP! I CAAAAAA!” Kyle screamed as he was cut off by a sharp gasp, their body shook violently, the vibrations oscillated up and down as the torture continued, she sat up and slid her legs off the end of the bed, the view changed for a side shot of her body shaking its breasts as the minutes ticked by. Kyle had been reduced to moaning loudly, unable to think as the pleasure continued, nearly passing out by the time it was finished. Kyle gasped, panted and coughed as he whimpered, “Please, no more.” She sat there, shaking her breasts back and forth for a few minutes, Kyle heard the voice a few more times, each were for five to ten minutes. Trapped with this slutty milf, he continued to struggle and moan as she continued her stream, finally stopping after three hours. She trembled, the room smelled of sex, she pulled the vibrator out of their twitching pussy, she sat it down on the table next to the laptop. <br />
<br />
Kyle watched as she set the schedule for their five days of the week, today was Fun Time Friday, you pay, he screams. She set up the rest of the days between Monday and Thrusday. Kyle didn&#39;t say anything as she set these up, it wouldn&#39;t matter, she couldn&#39;t hear him, and if she could she didn&#39;t pay attention to his please. She finished up and logged off, seemingly satisfied with the two hundred dollars they made that day and too them into the shower. In the shower she seemed to take her time, cleaning them slowly, gently, she got her entire body and stopped at Kyle&#39;s head. She reached her hands up to his head and he struggled to get away, he felt her hands gently touch his face, caressing it, she took the wash cloth and cleaned his face, giving him ample time to hold their breath before putting him under the water. She took her hand and touched his eye lids, pushing them down gently as she put his head under the water to start washing his hair, she messaged his scalp, taking time to lather all of his hair. After the shower she dried herself off and got to his head, she treated him gently again, and used a hair dryer to dry his hair, Kyle stared in the mirror as the goddess he was attached to combed his hair in a way he never liked, no that he could do anything about it. <br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know if you can hear me, but thank you.” He mumbled, she held a thumbs up and Kyle stared in shock, “You... you can hear me?” Her hand made a duck face and nodded, then before he could continue she walked them into the bedroom, “Wait, I need to talk to you.” She shook her finger at him, touched his nose, and went about her business, he started to struggle again, she touched his cheek and patted it. He sighed, giving up, she patted his head and continued cleaning up, putting away their cameras and the laptop, cleaning and sterilizing the vibrator, and changing the bed sheets. She then put on a silk robe, and grabbed something with a lot of buttons, slipping it into her robe, then went out to the kitchen and got them some food. She sat down on the couch, turned on some soap operas and brought some food to his mouth.<br />
<br />
“I want to talk to you first.” He said, she insisted, pushing the food against his lips, he finally relented and took the bite, as he chewed he felt their shared hands using the device she grabbed, she feed him another bite and as he swallowed it he heard the same voice from the stream.<br />
<br />
“Before you say anything, I&#39;m in charge, I make the decisions and I will do as I please. That being said, what do you want to talk about grandson?”</p>
