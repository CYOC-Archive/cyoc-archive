<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was another slow day at the coffee shop, so Isaac tried to cram in some more studying for school. He flipped through his textbook behind the counter, trying (and struggling) to focus on the words. The more he attempted to concentrate, the foggier his mind became, like his subconscious was actively fighting against him. He felt as if he was reading the book for the first time in his life, even though he’d been studying for the course all semester. The final exam was only a few days away, and Isaac had never felt so ill-prepared for a test in his life. It almost felt as if all his education was fading from his memory.<br />
<br />
“Slow day, huh?” Phillip, the other barista working the day shift, said behind Isaac. Isaac slammed his textbook shut in frustration and turned to face Phillip.<br />
<br />
“I’m not complaining. It gives me some much-needed study time for finals,” Isaac replied, glancing out at the nearly empty café. He frowned, noticing that his voice sounded much deeper and more hoarse than usual. He cleared his throat loudly, tugging at the sleeves of his polo which were feeling tight around his arms. He must have shrunk the shirt last time he’d done laundry; it barely fit him anymore.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, looks like you’ve been spending most of your free time at the gym,” Phillip smirked. “You look like you’ve put on 30 pounds of muscle since I saw you last week.”<br />
<br />
Phillip was in his early thirties, with long brown hair that he kept pulled back into a neat ponytail. He was olive skinned with dark features and a charming smile. Isaac had never noticed how well Phillip’s tight clothes showed off his muscular body but was now finding it difficult not to openly ogle at the other man.<br />
<br />
Isaac glanced down at his own body, curious about Phillip’s comments. He was surprised to see that his usually scrawny forearms were toned with definition, and his biceps had similarly bulked up, his shoulders broader than they had been that morning. Starting to panic, Isaac quickly ran for the staff bathroom, ignoring Phillip’s calls of concern behind him. After locking the door, Isaac took a steady breath and turned to look at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Something was definitely wrong. He looked like he was closer to thirty than in his mid twenties, his bulging muscles practically tearing out of his clothes. As Isaac continued to look on, his biceps continued to thicken, large veins growing down his arms. As his shirt sleeves started to tear, Isaac quickly threw off his polo, leaving him shirtless. His chest had already started to bulk up, with his pecs inflating with muscle and fat, leaving his pectorals slightly drooping over his belly. His lean torso started to push outwards, protruding into a round muscle gut. Thick dark brown hairs were sprouting out from his chest and quickly spreading across his arms and stomach.<br />
<br />
Isaac had no idea what was happening and didn’t know how to stop it. By now, he had figured out that he was changing back into Russel, but he hadn’t taken the DILF pills in over 24 hours. Something else must have been causing the transformation. He could feel Russel’s presence in his mind, eager to take control of Isaac’s body.<br />
<br />
His bony ass started to round out and he could feel his khakis starting to tear as his butt grew more cushioned. Isaac frantically pulled off what remained of his khakis so he was now just wearing Russel’s jock. Isaac’s legs lengthened as his calves and quads grew thicker, the dark hairs spreading downwards to cover the lower half of his body.<br />
<br />
Russel’s jock! Isaac realized the older man’s underwear must have been causing the changes somehow. He reached down to pull the jock off but found himself unable to move his arms.<br />
<br />
“Not so fast, boy,” Russel’s deep, sexy voice echoed through Isaac’s mind, “This body is mine now.”<br />
<br />
Isaac moaned as he felt his already hard cock grow thicker and longer in Russel’s jock. His balls swelled larger, filling with Russel’s semen. He looked back at his reflection in the mirror, unable to do anything else; he now appeared to be in his mid forties, with a 5 o’clock shadow and a defined jawline. His bright blonde hair had retracted back into his scalp, leaving him with a buzzcut; the hair darkened to brown with a few streaks of gray.<br />
<br />
Russel took control of his body, doing a quick flex in the mirror to admire his massive muscles. He reached his hand down into his jock and gave his dick a few quick strokes, grunting in pleasure as he came, shooting a massive load at the bathroom mirror. Usually, he could feel Isaac’s subconscious deep within him, but he didn’t feel the boy’s</p>
