<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Saying their mantra of &#39;left, right, left, right...&#39; together, they walked towards the basement bathroom. Max gripped the door handle and pushed it open. The bathroom was small, but as they stepped inside, it felt unusually cramped. Carefully, they sidestepped by the sink so he could shut the door. Neither wanted their parents to see them taking a leak. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll step backwards first. The toilet is right behind us.&quot; Max said, remembering to say aloud what he wanted to do first. He shifted his foot backwards, but he felt their tedious balance shift. &quot;Whoa!&#39; he exclaimed, bracing his arm against the bathroom wall to keep them from stumbling. &quot;Now who isn&#39;t checking! You were supposed to brace your leg.&quot; Even now, the statement sounded weird to say. Max wondered for a moment how long before their situation would seem &#39;normal&#39; to them, and then he wondered if he ever wanted it to feel normal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... I was transfixed on our reflection.&quot; Kenneth pointed to the mirror in front of them.<br />
<br />
He had forgotten about the bathroom mirror. He looked ahead and gawked at their reflection. It was eerie seeing their two, independent heads sharing the same shoulders. With no scars or stitches, it almost seemed like they were born that way. He was not sure why, but he felt that he and Kenneth looked more similar than they ever had before, as if sharing a body made their faces shift to look like one another. &quot;Um... lets finish what we came here to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Kenneth agreed, seemingly not interested in gazing at their reflection any more. He caught his brother shiver in the reflection, but the involuntary movement stopped halfway across their shoulder. It was disorienting to see, but Max focused on coordinating with Kenneth.<br />
<br />
They agreed to sit on the toilet seat instead of stand as they pulled their boxers down. Just like before, their single dick hung between their legs, and just like before, Max felt nervous about touching it. &quot;So... how do we do this?&quot; He asked. &quot;Do you pee, or do I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you want to pee all over the toilet and ourself, one of us is going to have to hold it down.&quot; Kenneth stated, matter of factly, but the pounding in their hearts betrayed his anxiousness. <br />
<br />
Remembering how odd the sensation of having his brother touch their dick, he proposed, &quot;Why don&#39;t we both hold it then. Maybe then it will...&quot; He was not sure how to finish his sentence. It would feel strange having someone else touch his dick, which really wasn&#39;t just his. He hoped that if he touched it too, it would feel less awkward. <br />
<br />
&quot;... feel normal...&quot; Kenneth tried to finish the sentence, though it did not grasp what Max had been thinking. &quot;Okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, they both placed a few fingers on the head, angling it downward. Strangely, he felt something loosen inside and the penis began to leak drops of urine. &quot;Is that you?&quot; Max asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so...&quot; Kenneth tried to answer as his cheeks became flush. &quot;But its like there is... resistance or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell does that mean?&quot; Max asked quizzically. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know! This is kind of my first time peeing while sharing a body!&quot; Kenneth spoke defensively. <br />
<br />
The dribbling stopped, but Max still felt the urge, the need to relive themselves. Like he had done so many times before, he tried to release the urine, but it too only came out in dribbles. &quot;Fine... you&#39;re right. There is resistance...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenneth&#39;s cheeks seemed to grow redder, and Max could not help but blush too. &quot;You know how we seem to both have sensation of our core and muscles along the center of our body?&quot; Kenneth asked, to which Max nodded. &quot;I think relieving ourselves is something we both have to do... jointly. The muscles in our bladder may not fully respond to just one of us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what they say...&quot; Max spoke gently, trying to clear the air. &quot;Brothers that stick together, pee together.&quot; Kenneth sighed heavily, but he could not hide the half-smile. &quot;So...&quot; Max spoke more seriously, &quot;We try on the count of three. 1... 2... 3.&quot; This time, he felt the muscle that controlled the flow of urine release more easily. Max heard his brother let out a sigh, just as Max, himself, felt more comfortable with their bladder empty. They stared at each other for a moment, but decided not to speak about it. He did not want to think about how they were going to have to take a shit. If the muscles of their bladder were so intertwined, how were they going to defecate. <br />
<br />
Kenneth shook their dick, before they carefully stood back up. Each grabbed a hold of one side of their boxers, and pulled it back up. Max tried reaching for the door, while Kenneth tried stepping towards the sink. They half-fell forward but Kenneth caught them with one hand around the bowel. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Opening the door to leave.&quot; Max stated simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to wash our hands.&quot; Kenneth state matter of factly again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We only peed. Washing if for when we...&quot; Max did not say the rest of his sentence. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re supposed to wash every time you use the bathroom.&quot; He added after a brief pause &quot;Soap and water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Max agreed, not wanting to argue on this issue. They spent the next minute rubbing soap into each other&#39;s hand and rinsing them in the hot flowing water. Finished, they stepped out of the basement bathroom.</p>
