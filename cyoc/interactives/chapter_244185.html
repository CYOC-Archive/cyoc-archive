<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two weeks passed, May ended, school let out for the year for Jon and Denise attended her graduation. And during this time, she didn&#39;t use the Chronivac to carry out the next step in her plan. Content to watch her foster brother squirm and struggle to make sense of what he was experiencing, she also explored the software in an attempt to learn more about it.<br />
<br />
In the process of doing this, Denise discovered there was an option for awareness, which she noticed was turned off. Figuring this might explain why some people had begun to give Jon strange looks, why Billy had gone off on him at one point, she guessed it must be for who was aware of the changes. Seeing it as the way it was set meant everyone knew of what was happening to Jon, she considered altering it so only she and Jon knew, but, after going back and forth, Denise left it the way it was, figuring it worked out better this way. Moving on to other things, she figured out how to set a timer, both to revert Jon back, if she so chose to, as well as set it so another change could initiate sometime after she morphed her foster brother even more. Leaving it alone for the moment, she soon reached the end of what she figured she could do with Chronivac and moved on, promising herself she&#39;d use it in a day or two.<br />
<br />
But a day or two turned into several days, which became a week, then a week and a half, and before Denise knew it, it was past the first week in June. Deciding she&#39;d put it off long enough, she sat down at the computer and booted it up. Inserting the disk, she waited for the programme to start, and when it did, she scrolled to a specific section. Toying with the idea of skipping giving Jon a taste for girl&#39;s clothes for the moment and instead doing something else, she considered her options of giving him breasts, or hair which was soft, full, and came down to just past the midpoint of his back.<br />
<br />
These ideas were both tempting, but thinking about her foster brother and what he was going through, Denise decided it might be better to take things slow. Pulling up his clothing option, she left it, for the moment, he still wore clothes suitable for a boy, but added the knowledge about girl&#39;s clothes, styles, what was popular, what wasn&#39;t, among other details. Smirking at this, wondering how he&#39;d take it suddenly being drawn to a more feminine style of dressing, she included a few more details to round it all out, left the awareness the way was, and saved the profile. Sending the data to the emitter, she ejected it, locked Jon&#39;s profile, which she made sure wasn&#39;t labelled as such, exited the programme, made sure it couldn&#39;t be accessed without a code, and removed the disk, which she had discovered was another safety feature, as it prevented people from opening the programme unless they had the disk. Putting everything except the remote away, Denise went to look for her foster brother.<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jon couldn&#39;t understand what was wrong. For reasons he couldn&#39;t understand, it was as if his world had turned upside down, mind had gone right round the twist, and he&#39;d gone from thinking and behaving like a guy of fifteen to a girl of fifteen. He&#39;d tried again and again to fight against it, but things sort of slipped out. When he and Billy had gone to the mall the day it started, his friend caught him a couple times checking out guys, stopped him when he almost went into the girl&#39;s toilets, and grew frustrated when Jon wouldn&#39;t laugh at his sexist jokes.<br />
<br />
From there, everything rapidly went downhill. His foster parents noticed the shift in his behaviour, and had grown concerned to the point they were talking about taking him to see some head doctor. At school, his teachers continued to ask him if he was alright, if there was anything he wanted to talk to them about, sent him continuously to the guidance counsellor, as well as excluded him from doing certain things, such as changing in the locker rooms, as, according to the coach, he was making the others uncomfortable. And with Billy, it got so bad, he actually got in a screaming match with him, which ended with Jon calling Billy an immature dipweed and his friend walking out, telling him, &quot;When you stopped acting like you want to be a girl, come find me.&quot;<br />
<br />
On one hand, he wanted to go knock sense into Billy, show him he was still all guy. Yet, on the other hand, he didn&#39;t think it&#39;d be appropriate and instead thought the better option would be to sit down and talk, come to a mutual understanding. Weirded out by such thoughts, Jon had talked himself out of contacting Billy for as long as he could. And now, faced with a long summer by himself, he&#39;d broken down and called Billy with the hopes of patching up their friendship.<br />
<br />
His friend due over in about a half an hour, Jon felt it was more than enough time to get his mind in order and try to act like a guy, like who he&#39;d been before his mind had started taking its strange, feminine turns. Hoping he wouldn&#39;t have one of those female slips, as he&#39;d come to call them, he was so lost in thought, he didn&#39;t see Denise as she entered the room, point a remote at him, then leave a few seconds afterward. Telling himself over and over, &quot;I&#39;m a guy. I do things a guy does. I shouldn&#39;t know about make-up and tampons and clothes and want to check out guys or need to sit to pee or how to do any number of things a girl does. I shouldn&#39;t want to talk to girls about their problems, console and comfort them,&quot; he found it didn&#39;t help as for some reason his mind kept drifting to several boxes the Parkers kept in the attic which contained stuff left behind by other foster children. Knowing several of those boxes had girl&#39;s clothes in them, he shook his head and tried to ignore the sudden urge to go take a look.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at the clock, and he noted he still had around twenty-five minutes or so before Billy showed up. Starting to fidget, feel antsy, he wondered if a quick peek wouldn&#39;t hurt. Knowing Billy was hardly ever on time, he tried to tell himself, &quot;No. Don&#39;t do anything to mess things up. Just sit here and wait for Billy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet, even as he told himself this, it was almost as if his mind and body had other ideas. Feeling as his mind slipped into a more feminine frame, he stood and headed up to the attic. There, he searched until he found three boxes filled with clothes which he guessed would fit. Hauling them down to his room one by one, he closed the door, shucked off his clothes and proceeded to go through them. Trying on one thing after another, he was suddenly drawn back to the here and now when a voice exclaimed, &quot;What, the, fuck!&quot; and turning, seeing Billy standing in the door, it took Jon a moment before realising he was wearing denim shortalls and a one-piece, whitish-pastel blue, long-sleeve swimsuit which zipped up in the front and had butterflies printed the front.<br />
<br />
The two stared open-mouth at each other for a moment, and as Jon became aware he&#39;d tucked his junk between his legs, Billy screeched out, &quot;Is this what you invited over here to talk to me about?! To show me?! If so, the truth is already known about how you act. So, I guess it&#39;s also no secret you not only act like a girl, know more about being a girl than a guy should, but you also dress like one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jon, still too stunned, wanted to say something, to explain it wasn&#39;t what Billy thought. Hugging himself, unaware of how much it made him look like a girl, he struggled to say something. But, before he could, Mr Parker, drawn by the yelling, came upstairs, started to demanded what was going on, but stopped upon seeing Jon. A mixture of emotions crossing his face before he finally managed, &quot;Billy, go home, now,&quot; to which the teenager spat out, &quot;Fine. I was going anyway,&quot; before he turned and stormed back downstairs.<br />
<br />
Moments after he heard the sound of the front door slamming shut, Jon found himself ordered downstairs. Wanting to tell Mr Parker it wasn&#39;t what he thought, though was unsure what his foster father believed, and to ask to be allowed to at least get changed, he didn&#39;t get the chance when Mr Parker told him, &quot;I said downstairs, now!&quot; and pushing past his foster father, Jon headed downstairs, followed by Mr Parker. There, he was expected to sit and wait until Mrs Parker came home, after which he was subjected to a long, one-sided discussion about how they were concerned for him, wanted to make sure he knew what he was getting into, and how they wanted only best for him, which meant he was to go and see a doctor three times a week.<br />
<br />
From where she sat on the stairs, listening to this, Denise smiled. Having caught sight of Jon wearing girl&#39;s clothes, she hadn&#39;t expected him to actually go so far as to dress like a girl. Thinking about the Chronivac, wondering if what she&#39;d inputted had anything to do with the way Jon was now dressed, she wanted to run upstairs, fetch the disk, and check it the programme. But, resisting the urge, she listened for a bit longer before she crept upstairs. Deciding to wait a bit to see how everything played out, she already had an idea what she&#39;d change next on her foster brother.</p>
