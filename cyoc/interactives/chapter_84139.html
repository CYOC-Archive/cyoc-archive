<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘Going over to a clown&#39;s house for a &#39;present&#39;?’ He wasn&#39;t so stupid as to know what that implied but with a clown it could be a prank. Whatever the case it would be weird and silly on so many levels. Jeff slips the paper into his pocket.<br />
&quot;Come on man, she was hot and obviously wanted you&quot; Ben shouts out<br />
He reaches out and grabs a clown girl by the waist and pulls her in, she laughs and gives him a kiss.<br />
The beer must have been strong Ben is looking really drunk, he is getting red in the face; no, as the serving girl curls up in his lap you get a better look, just his nose, actually the rest of him is looking pale. <br />
You shake your head a bit as you feel a bit fuzzy, the beer must have been strong. The sight of Ben and the girl making out is really turning you on. You look down and see that your glass is empty, the hell with it it&#39;s your birthday. You signal the bar keep for another, who is a clown now too? <br />
&#39;When did that happen?&#39;<br />
You shake your head and take a gulp of the beer and turn to point it out to David but find him with a clown girl on his lap also laughing and looking a little rough with his five o&#39;clock shadow showing. He pauses talking up the serving girl to pick up a cigar and take a drag on it.<br />
&#39;When did he start smoking cigars?&#39;<br />
Fuck them, they were getting their own and ignoring him on his birthday. You feel pissed and horny. It is getting late so you chug your beer and decide to get out here and have some fun before your birthday is over. You hail a buggy and reaching to your pocket to check you have money and find the piece of paper. Pulling it out you look at it, weird and silly, but hey you feel like getting a &#39;present&#39;. You show the piece of paper to the driver who replies &quot;yea, I know where it is, on the east side of Clown City.&quot; The name of the place causes you to pause but you figure it must be just a slang term for where a bunch of the girls working here live. You hop in the buggy and the driver whips the horses. The tourist part of the island flies past as you lean back and relax. The driver steers through a forest taking turns as the path branches with confidence. The trees thin and your eyes are assaulted by buildings of every color and shape. You roll through the streets not really worrying about the oddness of it as the fuzziness has increased from the last beer.<br />
&quot;Here you go&quot; You snap back to attention as you realize the buggy has stopped outside a purple and pink stripped building.<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; you reach in to your pocket for money &quot;no charge, this is Pleasure Island&quot; you shrug and wave a thank you to the guy as you turn and enter the building. You&#39;re thankful that her apartment is on the first floor thinking that you probably could not navigate stairs in your state. You knock on her door and it is swung open and you are greeted by the clown girl from the bar. She embraces you in a big hug and move to gives you a lasting kiss. Your buzzed mind struggles to understand why she is still in her clown costume, make-up and all. Not caring anymore you embrace her and start to return the kiss with vigor. <br />
She breaks the kiss and backs up &quot;I am so glad you decided to come over tonight&quot; You get your first good look at her. She has pink curly hair with red highlights, every bit of skin that you can see is white, her eyebrows are draw on in high arches, on her cheeks are perfect circles of blush with three black freckles in them, a pink clown nose the size of a ping bong ball, and a red smile with pink on the inside. You don&#39;t know if it is the beer or some undiscovered sexual desire but a &#39;present&#39; from her doesn’t seem weird or silly but extremely sexy, illustrated by the power of your erection pushing at your pants.<br />
&quot;I wanted to get my &#39;present&#39;&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I can&#39;t give it to you till after your birthday&quot; Annoyance and frustration blooms inside you.<br />
&quot;But I can think of some things we can do till then&quot; She backs up and slowly unzips her clown suit revealing she is wearing nothing under it. Any previous feelings vanish in an instant, you should wonder why her make-up extends to here entire body, why her pubic bush is the same pink as her hair, why her nipples are becoming stiff to cherry size pink balls but thinking has been transferred from your drunk brain to other parts of your male body.<br />
She leads you by the hand to her bedroom and you barely register the odd clown decor before she lays on the bed and join her leaning down to take one of the pink balls that are her nipples in your mouth and rolling it around with your tongue. Taking your hand and guides it to her clown nose she directs you to rub and honk it. The part of you that is thinking doesn&#39;t wonder about how it feels like a real nose. Moans and honking noise feel the room as she squirms under you, you reach down and run your fingers though her pubic hair and into her pussy to find a small pink perfectly round ball that is her clit and start to rub it. She starts to breath heavier and faster and finally pushing you over on to your back and straddles you, tearing off your shirt and leaning in for frantic kissing, her nose rubbing your face. Running her hands over your chest she finds your nipples and starts to squeeze and play with them, eventually leaning down and using her mouth. Her hips start to grind into your erect cock causing you to groan. She gets off you and undoes your pants sliding them and your underwear off in one motion, your dick springs to its vertical position. Climbing back beside you, hands guide your tool into a warm, wet, red and pink smiling mouth. The mouth starts to slide down adding a tongue swirling around your dick then reverses direction and slide up. The cycle repeats itself faster and faster till you can feel the familiar tingle build. She feels you start to tense under her and immediately stops with an exclamation of protest from you.<br />
&quot;Your friends got their &#39;presents&#39; tonight but you have to wait till after your birthday&quot; You look for a clock and spot one next to the bed and see that it is almost midnight, you feel a rush of excitement at the thought of getting your &#39;present&#39;.<br />
She slides up running her hands along your chest and bring her big smile down upon your lips in a slow kiss forcing your mouth open and running her tongue around the inside of your mouth. Straddling you, getting up on her knees she grabs you and lines you up to enter her. Slowly lowering herself on to you, you feel a warm pleasure envelope you dick. Getting her rhythm going she moans in bliss as you feel the familiar tingles in your balls. The rhythm continues as the sound of a clock slowly chiming midnight.<br />
&quot;Time for your &quot;present&#39;&quot; she pants picking up speed<br />
&quot;You get to join your friends as a clown, yea!!!!!!!!!, You couldn’t become a clown on your birthday so you had to wait&quot;<br />
&quot;What&quot; You can feel your muscles tightening as your orgasm approaches<br />
&quot;David is now a tramp picking up trash at the carnival and Ben is an august clown helping in the face painting area&quot;<br />
Suddenly everything clicks together, too late though. You feel the tingling spread to the rest of your body and in a flash it turns white, your hair sticks straight up and turns a shade of neon green, your feet shoot up tripling in length, your eyebrows disappear and return as drawn arches higher on your forehead, blue triangles appear below your eyes and your lips turn red, wider and turn up into a smile.<br />
&quot;NO, No....ugh&quot; You try and struggle to get out for under her but your orgasm hits you muscle go rigid. With a pop your nose explodes in to a red ball the size of a peach. She throws back her head and screams as she feels your dick shooting and her orgasm hits. New knowledge of clown gags and tricks, face painting, balloons and magic fill your head and start to push out other, now less important, things. &quot;WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME&quot; Her breathing slows and she lays forward on you &quot;Gave you what you wanted, your &#39;present&#39;&quot; then reaches up and honks your nose. The noise echoes through your head shattering everything of your previous life and reforming it anew as a clown’s life. &quot;HA, Ha, ha, you always give me the best presents&quot; you embrace her in a huge hug.</p>
