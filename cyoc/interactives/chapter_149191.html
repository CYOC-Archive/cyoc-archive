<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What felt like a band that consisted of only a drum section crashed in his head as slowly he regained consciousness. Blinking, unable to fully piece together what had happened, Sei was disorientated by the soft glow to his right. Turning his head, which caused the pain to explode to the point that he almost passed out again, the sixteen year old stared stupidly at what appeared to be an antique oil lamp. Muttering, &quot;Damn thing looks about a hundred years ago, like something my grandma would use,&quot; Sei slowly turned away, shut his eyes against the agony and once again felt himself drifting.<br />
<br />
Suddenly fully awake, he opened his eyes and peered at the lamp as it it came to him that he was no longer in a shower, he was dry, and that he was lying on something soft. His confusion deepening, Sei thought that, if he didn&#39;t know any better, he had somehow wound up in a bed and slowly sitting up, he squeezed his eyes shut and waited for the pain in his head to lessen. Opening his eyes after a bit, he didn&#39;t rush things as he started to look at the bed, but stopped when he noticed something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck,&quot; escaped him as he gazed in bemusement at the fact that he was now wearing a tight pair of blue, Hello Kitty boxers and a form-fitting Hello Kitty tank top.<br />
<br />
Bewildered as to why he had on what were clearly girl&#39;s underclothes, it slowly came to him that it wasn&#39;t simply the boxers and tank top he&#39;d been dressed in. Gripping one of the leg holes, Sei pulled it up until a pair of tight, tiny, pink panties, also with a Hello Kitty design printed on them, could be seen. Staring at the underwear, it gradually came to him that, for reasons he could not fathom, his cock and balls had been tucked between his legs. Letting go of the fabric, disturbed that the underwear pulled so tightly that it didn&#39;t allow for any bulges and held his junk snugly in place, Sei muttered, &quot;This is too much,&quot; and struggling to stand, he almost fell back on the bed when the pain in his head almost overwhelmed him.<br />
<br />
The severe ache in his head eventually dissipated and glad for it, Sei remained next to the bed as he began to glance about for his clothes. The room he thought looked like it might be a girl&#39;s bedroom, but in the limited light he couldn&#39;t be sure. The bed he&#39;d awoken in he was certain was something a girl would like, as it had been soft and the comforter covering it was white with a pastel stripped and polka dot pattern. Taking another quick glance about, he took a step forward and almost fell over what appeared to be a old-fashioned doctor&#39;s case, open and displaying a number of vials and used syringe that had an image stamped on it. Reaching down and picking it up, he thought the symbol stamped on it looked like a circle with a plus sign attached to the bottom of it. Putting the syringe back, finding it odd that it felt like it was made of glass, Sei shuddered at the prospect that not only had someone dressed him, but they had dosed him with an unknown substance.<br />
<br />
Needing more than ever to find his clothes and get out here, he again glanced about. Not seeing his clothes, only what looked like a bathrobe hanging on a nearby chair, Sei toyed with the idea of going to looking elsewhere in the house as he stared at a door across the room. Muttering, &quot;If I do, I ain&#39;t certainly going to go about dressed like this,&quot; he started to consider taking off the clothes he was wearing.<br />
<br />
Before he could get too far in his decision, he was suddenly overcome with a discomfort that was worse than what he had felt upon waking. Doubling over, a pinching, stabbing, sensation starting in his abdomen, Sei hugged himself and dropped to his knees. Thinking something inside might have burst, he would swear he felt a spreading sensation, he gasped as suddenly the pain disappeared as quickly as it appeared. Disturbed by this, the teenage boy remained where he was a moment longer before tentatively reaching out to the bed and using it help him stand. Taking a couple tottering steps, unsure what had happened, Sei suddenly announced, &quot;Fuck this. I&#39;m out of here,&quot; and grabbing the robe, a white fleece garment with pink polka dots, a pink sash, a hood and an image of Hello Kitty printed on the back and on the only pocket, he pulled it on and stumbled toward the door.<br />
<br />
Outside the room, suddenly he felt conspicuous that he had on not only girl&#39;s boxers, a tank top and panties, but that he&#39;d also pulled on what was clearly a girl&#39;s robe. Stopping a couple feet away from the bedroom, he peered down at what he was wearing and unable to really see it, he huffed in agitation and tied to the robe shut. Figuring, &quot;It will have to do until I can find either my clothes or something a guy would wear,&quot; he glanced up and down the hall, unsure of where exactly he was and why the hall didn&#39;t appear as dark as it had before.<br />
<br />
After a moment it came to him that some time must have passed and that, if he went by the lighting, the storm had finally passed. Hoping the other&#39;s hadn&#39;t ditched him, Sei glanced up and down the hall, decided on a direction, took a step and again doubled over in pain as the same thing that happened minutes ago overtook him. Thinking that it was somehow worse, he cried out in anguish as he mentally asked himself, &quot;What is happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
The agony in his abdomen grew to the point that he was close to passing out again, Sei eventually squeezed his eyes shut as it blossomed. Growing to encompass not only his abdomen, but also his groin, butt and part of his chest, the teenage boy dropped to his knees again and wrapped his arms tightly around his midsection. Gasping, crying out, he was confused as to what was happened, and oblivious to how his face took on a very slight feminine appearance whilst his short brown hair took on volume. And as it became fuller, looking normal for a girl, it lengthened slightly down to just shy of his shoulders and darkened to a shade closer to black.<br />
<br />
And then, as quickly as came over him, the pain was gone. A thin line of drool escaped him as he continued kneel on the hard wood floor and after a moment, Sei slowly managed to stand up. Bewildered by what was happening, and why he&#39;d woken up wearing girl&#39;s clothes, the teenage boy gazed down and absently tugged at the hem of the robe, which only came down an inch above his knees. His thoughts jumbled and not making much sense as he tried to think of escape, finding his friends, what happened to him, what he awoke to, who had might have dressed him, and what he might have been injected with, all at once, he took a tottering step. Not paying attention to where he was going, his body sort of going on autopilot, sei confusingly mumbled, &quot;Probably should look for the front door,&quot; as he began shambling down the hallway, sure that, somehow, he probably should go back downstairs.</p>
