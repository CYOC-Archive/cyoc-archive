<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan left Patrick with Angus at the tattoo parlour. It was his first time Patrick was to act as Angus’ Alpha. <br />
In the meantime he was going out with Marcus to collect an item to assist in Angus training.<br />
What had just happened in the tattoo parlour was such a heady experience, part of him needed to just step out <br />
into the fresh air.<br />
<br />
Just an hour and a half ago he had penalised Angus for being out of control and not having dicipline, but Dan <br />
he was feeling the same. One of the advantages of being the Master is that you can take what you want whenever <br />
you want it. Dan had an alternative motivation for bringing Marcus with him. Patrick and Angus needed to focus <br />
on their responsibilities.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Dan had been completely horned up and he desperately needed an outlet. Even looking at Marcus <br />
in his skin tight wrestling suit with the crotch blown out from the kissing incident earlier was enough make <br />
Dan feel hyper possessive and send him into his dom space.<br />
<br />
Dan looked around the corner of a building and down an alleyway. He instructed Marcus to follow him around the <br />
back of a building, obscured from view.<br />
<br />
Marcus followed obediently, not even questioning to himself why his Master would take him to such a place.<br />
Dan was in no mood to negotiate or to exchange pleasantries. He was here for business.<br />
<br />
“Marcus, get onto your knees and suck my nipples!”<br />
<br />
Dan took off his shirt revealing his own thick, furry pecs. Dan noticed the expression on Marcus’ face as he <br />
knelt down. It was one of sheer determination and focus, almost as though it had been his purpose in life in <br />
life to be down there on his knees and servicing his. That his business was his Master’s pleasure and it was a <br />
responsibility that he took extraordinarily personally, that his personal worth was directly related to his <br />
performance.<br />
<br />
Marcus’ mouth connected with his Master’s nipple. He started to caress it slowly by circling it with the <br />
outside of his tongue, teasing his Master with what was to come. Dan felt the coarseness of his pup’s beard on <br />
his chest. With no hesitation, he stated to build up the pressure and the intensity of his sucking. Marcus <br />
lifted his hand to his Master’s other nipple, starting to tweak it between his forefinger and thumb.<br />
<br />
Marcus was an expert at his craft, he fed off of his Master’s signals and intensified his efforts. He built up <br />
his Master to almost the peak of ecstasy, then backed off a little, slowing things down. Angus would then <br />
redouble his efforts devouring his Master’s nipples and take his Master another inch towards his peak and then <br />
back away slightly once more. <br />
<br />
Dan looked down at his tenacious pup, his neck (if you could even say that he had one) was covered in black <br />
and blue marks. Dan couldn’t help himself, he needed to mark his pup as much as he could. Dan bit down on his <br />
pup’s neck and added to his collection. Marcus breathed heavily and moaned with the sensations. His pup <br />
whispered into his Master’s neck when he was done “thank-you Master... I... I need you”. Marcus emanated a <br />
heady fragrance of his own submission.<br />
<br />
Angus’ words and smell put Dan over the edge. He looked down at his submissive on his knees, his dick red and <br />
painfully erect, jutting out of the hole in his wrestling suit. Marcus was unlike Patrick and Angus – he had <br />
an iron will of discipline. For Marcus, his Masters pleasure is his only pleasure, the thing that sustains <br />
him. He could stay this way for hours if he must. One day Dan might just test it, but in the meantime his cock <br />
was aching for attention. It pressed itself hard against his own sternum at a modest twelve inches – his <br />
precum sticking his chest hair together.<br />
<br />
“Suck it!” Dan commanded.<br />
<br />
Marcus hungered for it. His eyes flickering with delight. He took a deep breath in and held it by it base, <br />
guiding it into his mouth and down his throat. Macus took the whole 12 inches effortlessly. No gag reflex!<br />
<br />
Waves of pleasure overtook Dan. As Marcus pushed his head closer into Dan to try and take in as much as he <br />
could, Dan responded by pushing his hips harder and faster into Marcus’ accommodating mouth. <br />
<br />
That wasn’t enough for Marcus, there was more he could do. He raised his beefy hands to Dan’s chest and <br />
gripped each of his nipples between his thumb and forefingers, starting off gentler. As he whipped his Master <br />
up into a flurry of pleasure he tugged on them harder and more intensely. Marcus removed his Master’s cock <br />
from his mouth and shoved his face up to his Master’s balls. He rubbed his beard across his plump orbs and <br />
then took them into his mouth whole. Damn he could open his mouth wide! Dan gasped, being given the gift of <br />
pure sensation from his dutiful pup.<br />
<br />
Dan resumed his rightful place sucking the entirety of his Master’s cock. To Marcus, Master’s cock is a totem <br />
to be worshiped, a focal point for all of his desires, his dreams, his life.<br />
 <br />
Dan’s balls tightened up as Marcus’ drove Dan over the edge, fireworks exploding within him as Dan’s rigid <br />
cock spurted wave after wave of thick, milky cum down Marcus’ throat. Marcus removed the cock from his mouth <br />
as it continued to spurt, getting caught in his beard.<br />
<br />
It took minutes for Dan to stop seeing stars and to recapture his breath. He’s never had a blowjob like that <br />
before in his life. Dan looked at his pup, cum still dripping from his beard looking perfectly contented with <br />
himself and with his life. He remained on his knees awaiting for his next orders.<br />
<br />
“Get up pup, we’ve got something to get for your brother Angus”.<br />
    <br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ <br />
<br />
<br />
Dan heard a cry of pain coming from the tattoo parlour. It was Angus!<br />
<br />
Dan and Marcus raced in as quickly as they could. Dan was suddenly struck with the heady smell of ginger pain-<br />
sweat.<br />
<br />
He found Angus on his back. Patrick was standing over him holding his hand. A smile spread across Angus’s face <br />
and his face flushed upon recognition from his Master. Hanging from his nose was a new stainless steel bull <br />
ring, which glistened under the fluorescent lights of the tattoo parlour. It was 000 gauge and hung down <br />
heavily down on his face, the ball of the ring resting underneath his bottom lip. Dan’s bull pup had a new <br />
bull ring – very fitting of Angus’ name. He noticed that his nipples were now engorged with new rings of <br />
similar thickness and diameter to his septum. <br />
<br />
Angus’s cock twitched hanging over the side of the table. That was when Dan noticed the new prince Albert <br />
piercing hanging off the end - the icing on the cake. It must have been the same size as Patrick’s! These <br />
piercings and tattoos must have been excruciating – but it seemed that they had healed already.<br />
<br />
Ginger chemistry!<br />
<br />
It was now Angus’ turn to be speechless with emotional and physical exhaustion. His eyes were glowing.<br />
<br />
“We wanted to surprise you. I knew you loved my piercings Master, so I insisted he get some of his own. What <br />
do you think Master?” probed Patrick in his deep base voice.<br />
<br />
“I love them! I’m very proud of both of you”.<br />
<br />
Based on their reactions, it was the perfect thing to say to them both. Dan leaned over and kissed Angus on <br />
the forehead.<br />
<br />
“Angus, collect yourself and come with me. I have something special for you. Marcus, get on the table. Time <br />
for you to join the family. I think you've earned it.”</p>
