<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex and Marsyas returned to the wizard’s little shop as night was falling. They’d eaten dinner the pub, gone shopping for some light supplies, and were now ready to be briefed on their mission. Alex knocked on the glass door; there was a click and the door was opened, Pascal’s bushy beard and rotund belly protruding through the doorway.<br />
<br />
“C’mon in, boys. Glad you could make it,” he said in a jolly tone, closing the door behind him. He waved his hand, and with a zipping sound the curtains pulled themselves shut over the windows. He turned and gestured for them to follow, leading them up a dark staircase. Little lamps flickered to life as they climbed up to the second floor, coming into a large room lined with bookshelves. The room was furnished with large, cushiony armchairs and along, deep couch, all made of shiny dark leather. A big desk piled with paper and books and strange, smoking, objects stood in the corner of the room under a big, dark window. A gentle fire roared in a little brick fireplace in the center of the room. Hanging from the ceiling were an assortment of curious objects resembling wind-chimes, some of which spun and gyrated silently. <br />
<br />
The wizard shrugged out of his robe and hung it on a hook by the door, revealing a hairy, muscular body that had gone slightly to fat. Alex saw strange tattoos on his back and shoulders; lines and runes and geometric shapes. <br />
<br />
“Make yourselves at comfortable, boys,” he said, crossing the room to open a little corner cabinet. “Would anyone like a drink?”<br />
“Yes, please,” said Marsyas as he unfastened his pauldrons and undid his loin cloth and let it fall from his furry hips. <br />
<br />
“Uh, sure,” Alex also began to shuck off his few clothes and left his belongings with Marsyas before finding a seat on one of the couches. <br />
<br />
Pascal poured their drinks and then sauntered over to join them by the fire, his large manhood swaying with his steps. He handed a glass each to Alex and Marsyas, lifted his in with a casual grunt of “cheers” and tossed back his drink in one shot. Alex and Marsyas lifted their glasses and did the same. Upon drinking, Alex wanted to gag; it tasted like strong whiskey spiced with chili powder. <br />
<br />
Pascal planted himself in the armchair with a heavy sigh. He reached over to a spindly-legged table at his side and picked up a long glass pipe and a little ceramic jar. <br />
<br />
“So, boy, I see you roped Marsyas into this little errand of mine,” he said as he began packing the chamber of his pipe. <br />
<br />
“Well, Marsyas wanted to help…” Alex began.<br />
<br />
“Yes, help you stay alive and not get eaten or worse,” the faun interjected, grinning at him from across the couch. <br />
<br />
Pascal chuckled. “its good he’s coming along. You’ll need help to find this thing, and Marsyas is an excellent tracker and woodsman. He’ll keep you safe and cozy,” he winked, before lighting the pipe and taking a deep drag. <br />
<br />
“What is this thing your sending him after anyway?” asked Marsyas.<br />
<br />
“Just a unique little toy made by a great wizard who lived a long time ago. Its powers aren’t what’s important. We need it to complete our seal.”<br />
<br />
Marsyas snorted and rolled his eyes. “So, it’s come to that. Does Syoran really think his little gambit will work?”<br />
<br />
Pascal smiled a big toothy grin through his thick beard before letting out another cloud of smoke. “I’m sure I don’t know what the Archmage thinks. I’m just a humble man, trying to secure a fat and happy life for myself.” He said, slapping his belly and laughing.<br />
<br />
“And where is this thing located again?” asked Alex.<br />
<br />
“East,” said the wizard. “Beyond the Baritone Alps, in the desert. I will give you a map and my notes tomorrow. But now, I’d like to hear more about this world of yours that you come from Alex.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, okay,” said Alex, surprised. “What do you want to know.”<br />
<br />
Alex spent the next half hour fielding questions from the wizard, and also from Marsyas about the ins and outs of his world. He talked about his life and his job mostly, embellishing details when he didn’t feel like explaining something or if he didn’t know the details himself. They both were perplexed by the idea of an opposite sex, and seemed slightly offended at the notion that werewolves, wizards, and fauns were only the subject of fictional mythologies on his world.<br />
<br />
After a few quiet moments, the wizard spoke, “I think I know someone who might also be from your world.” He said, staring down at his folded arms.<br />
<br />
“Wait, really?” Alex was shocked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but this was almost ten years ago.” Pascal recalled. “He was lost and helpless in this world, like you,” he looked at Alex, who frowned. “He was quite shocked and scared, his first few days. He told me stories of his world that seem to match yours.”<br />
<br />
“So, someone else was brought here…” Alex said. He looked from the wizard to Marsyas. “Well, where is he now?”<br />
<br />
Marsyas held up his hands defensively. “I’ve never even heard of this man until now.”<br />
<br />
“He lives alone in the wilderness, hunting and trapping and not bothering with other men or the beast men.” Said the wizard somberly. “He hasn’t come to town in a long time. But I thought you should know; you might be lucky enough to meet on your journey and perhaps he may have answers for you as to why the both of you are here.” He spoke.<br />
<br />
Alex did hope that he would get a chance to meet this mystery man. The thought of meeting someone else from his world made him feel a pang of home-sickness.<br />
<br />
“I have another gift for you,” said Pascal, “Or a blessing, as it were, if you accept it.”<br />
<br />
“A blessing?” said Alex warily. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I’d like to impart to you some magical power for your journey. The blessing you received before has enhanced your physical attributes, quite well I must say,” the big man grinned at him before continuing, “But your magical power is lacking.”<br />
<br />
“But Raf and Roc told me I can only accept one blessing at a time.” Alex recalled.<br />
<br />
“That is true; one physical blessing. This blessing is magical.” He said.<br />
<br />
Alex thought about that; he’d been in this world long enough. Getting some magic power might be interesting. “Alright, I accept your blessing.” He said, before he remembered just exactly how he “received” his last blessing. The wizard seemed to sense his thoughts and spoke up.<br />
“Yes, boy. In this world, magic is at its most powerful when channeled by lust, love, and passion.” The old bear grinned at Alex, standing up. His large cock stuck out before him as it began to slowly grow and harden. Alex looked to Marsyas, who shrugged his wide shoulders and gave him a smile and a “do as thou wilt” expression. He looked over to Pascal, who now stood above him holding out a big, meaty hand. Alex took it was led from the room by the old bear, looking behind him to see Marsyas chuckling and reaching for the pip.<br />
<br />
At the stairs Pascal shocked Alex by picking him up and carrying him up the stairs, Alex laughing a little bit despite himself while being draped over the man’s broad, hairy back. After climbing the stairs, Alex was lifted off of Pascals shoulders and dropped gently on a large bed. He looked around the wizard’s bedroom, seeing old paintings and more books, his eyes resting on the man himself. He stood in front of him, his arms crossed over his meaty pectorals, his big hairy belly rising with his breath and his semi-hard cock twitching with his heartbeat. Alex noticed it was longer and thicker than Bo’s and consequently his own. Pascal seemed to be surveying him, doing some quick thinking before his eyes lit up as he appeared to find a solution. <br />
<br />
“I think I know just what magical blessing to give you.” He said, the corner of his mouth perking up.<br />
<br />
“Well?” Alex said, leaning back on his arms and looking the big man in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“Suck this,” he said, his hand reaching down to heft his enormous cock before Alex’s face. “And I’ll explain it to you.”<br />
<br />
Alex reached his hand out and wrapped it around Pascal’s hardening shaft, eying the bulbous head that slowly peaked from beneath his foreskin. Alex placed his other hand on the man’s shaft as well before taking the large head into his mouth. Pascal groaned as Alex began to lovingly lick and suck at the head of his now fully hard cock. He worked the head deeper into his mouth as he lightly stroked the shaft of Pascal’s cock.<br />
<br />
“You’ve changed a lot since entering this world, I’m sure,” Pascal said in an even tone, his eyes closed, “So I thought what better blessing to give you than the blessing of shapeshifting.”<br />
<br />
Alex listened to the man’s words while he slowly tried to engulf more and more of the man’s cock. Perhaps Pascal was working his magic already, because to Alex’s surprise the wizard’s cock began to penetrate deeper into his mouth and down his throat.<br />
<br />
Pascal rested his big hands on either side of Alex’s head as he continued sucking. “From now on in this world, your changes will be your own.” He lightly thrusted deeper into Alex’s throat; his eyes watered but he could still breathe fine and so he continued to massage the man’s length with his tongue and throat. “Your first form will the animal that resembles your spirt, but quickly you will learn to assume other shapes as well.”<br />
<br />
Alex felt something tickling his nose and realized that the man’s entire cock, easily almost as long as his arm, was fully and comfortably rammed down his throat. He could feel the big man’s enormous balls resting against his chin. Alex began to cradle and massage them as Pascal started to work himself in and out of Alex’s mouth a little faster.<br />
<br />
“Your form now will always be your default so long as you stay in this world. But with this blessing, you will learn to change into whatever living thing you desire.” He said. He gave Alex’s throat one final thrust before slowly dragging his cock out. Alex coughed and gagged as the giant log left his throat, feeling his muscles and bones gently shift into their natural place. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit. How was able to…” he muttered before suddenly he felt the big man’s weight on top of him.<br />
<br />
“Magic, baby. No one ever has a problem taking me,” he said, before bringing Alex in for a deep, scratchy kiss. The wizard’s beard was soft but itchy against his own face and chest, in fact he was soft and itchy all over. Alex ran his hands over Pascals hairy body, both men’s cocks throbbing as they were pressed between their strong hairy bodies. <br />
<br />
Pascal leaned forward and pushed himself further down the bed and drew Alex’s legs around him. “Time to finish sealing the magic, boy,” he said, inserting a finger into Alex’s ass. Alex moaned and writhed as Pascal added another, and then one more until he was gently working his for fingers in and along Alex’s asshole, patiently reading him for the pounding that was about to come. Pascal switched to running the tip of his big cock along Alex’s ass, laughing when Alex started reaching down to push it in himself. The wizard grabbed one of Alex’s legs with one hand and guided his mammoth cock into Alex with the other. Alex gasped as the enormous thing began working into him. He felt the same magical energy starting to course through him as when he was sucking Pascal’s cock, but this was stronger. The pain quickly subsided as he felt his body relax and surrender to the invasion of Pascal’s giant member. <br />
<br />
Pascal could sense Alex’s body was taking to the magic and thrust himself in to the hilt. Alex again felt the wind knocked out of him from the pressure, but no pain, only the delightful sensation of a man’ cock deep inside of his body and a man’s balls resting against his ass. <br />
<br />
Pascal began working his cock in and out, grabbing onto Alex’s leg and his own throbbing cock as he increased the power and speed of his thrusts. Alex reached his hands out to fondle the big man’s hairy nipples, eliciting a moan in response as he started thrusting harder. His giant balls were slapping against Alex’s ass, and Alex felt the man remove his hands and replace them in the small of his back. Pascal lifted him up and instinctively Alex wrapped his legs around the man’s wide waist. Pascals hands strongly gripped Alex’s buttocks as he resumed fucking Alex at a fast pace. The kissed passionately, all the while feeling the electric thrill of the magic coursing through their bodies. Alex could feel it settling into his bones, his flesh, his mind<br />
. <br />
Finally, it seemed Pascal wanted to finish things; he forced them both down onto the bed, holding himself over Alex with the younger man’s legs still up around his waist. He started fucking Alex as hard and deep as he could, his eyes closing and his lips moving as he muttered a string of words under his breath. But Alex couldn’t make them out as he was too busy laying back and enjoying the feeling of the giant cock rushing against his prostate. His hands snaked down to begin jerking his own cock as both their climaxes quickly approached. His pace becoming harder and faster than ever, Pascal growled and buried his bearded face in Alex’s shoulder as he came. Alex could feel waves of magical energy pulsing into him with each load that the man shot into him. It pushed him over the edge and Alex cried out, his vision blurring for a second as Pascal strongly caressed him in his big arms. Alex could feel Pascals giant cock resting, softening within him as he seemed to drift off to sleep, the force of the magic rendering him to unconsciousness as it finished its transformative work. <br />
<br />
Pascal released a big sigh and kissed the younger man lightly on the forehead. He gently rolled them both onto their sides, keeping Alex secured behind his arms and his softening cock still firmly ensconced up Alex’s warm ass. <br />
<br />
“Sleep tight, boy. You’re a shapeshifter now; when you wake up tomorrow, you’re in for a world of surprise,” he mused. And together they drifted off to sleep. </p>
<hr/><h3>
But what would Alex&#39;s first form as a new shapeshifter be when he woke up?</h3>
