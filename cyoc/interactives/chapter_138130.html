<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica prowled the grounds of the Martian territory, seeking a man, preferably a nice hunky Martian Man, with rippling with muscles and with a cock like a baseball bat.  Then she saw a car in the distance, and ran to the road, waving it down as it approached.  The window rolled down revealing only a young woman.  Jessica pouted in disappointment, but, she&#39;d make do.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you alright?&quot; asked the young woman, Miranda,  as she eyed Jessica&#39;s barely clothed form with concern, and, admittedly, with a hint of jealousy.  She&#39;d never SEEN such a perfect figure, and the other woman&#39;s face was movie-star beautiful as well.  Though, as the other woman came closer and Miranda picked up her scent, she began to find her surprise that she was staring with lust as well!  Now it wasn&#39;t like Miranda had NEVER looked at another woman before but she was pretty straight, and she&#39;d certainly never felt the way she was feeling now as she almost lecherously gazed up and down the other woman&#39;s form.<br />
<br />
Jessica just smiled happily as Miranda took in her assets, but at last she offered a wink and spoke.  &quot;Hey, sexy, what brings you out this way?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...I just, um&quot; Miranda stuttered, finding it for some reason hard to think straight, and unable to take her eyes off of the other&#39;s cleavage as Jessica leaned in towards her.  &quot;Look, are you ok?  Why are you, um, dressed like that? did something happen&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica giggled.  &quot;I&#39;m ok.  Why don&#39;t you get out and join me? I bet we could have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda shook her head in an effort to clear it.  &quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good idea.&quot; she said, sensing something suspicious about the odd woman<br />
<br />
Jessica pouted again.  &quot;Well, maybe you could...give me a ride?&quot; Something was off about the way she said that, but Miranda was increasingly having trouble thinking straight.  It seemed like every breath she took around this woman made her breath quicken, her pulse rise, and her head go fuzzy.  She figured it was probably ok to give the other woman a ride to civilization, if she needed it...  I mean, she certainly wasn&#39;t armed or anything, and she was rather smaller than Miranda.  &quot;um, ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
a bubbly &quot;Yay!&quot; was Jessica&#39;s gleeful response, and she all but bounced around the car and let herself in the passenger side.  Miranda didn&#39;t remember unlocking it, yet it opened and Jessica plopped her ample booty into the seat, in the process giving her breasts a jiggle that Miranda stared at almost wolfishly.  What&#39;s wrong with me? she thought.  I&#39;m not just ogling her, I&#39;m doing it like a man!<br />
<br />
But she put the car in drive, and as they took off down the road desire slowly ate away at all of Miranda&#39;s doubts.  She kept stealing side glances as Jessica, who only met them with welcoming smiles and giggles.  Soon Miranda was looking without shame.  It was so strange, yet so exciting the way she felt around this woman.  She felt...dominant, powerful.  It was such a new feeling; she&#39;d always been a rather submissive kitten with men, but it was a feeling she was growing to like.  Jessica offered another wink, and this time Miranda responded with a predatory grin.  &quot;So, do you have a name...cutie?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jessica smiled wickedly.  She knew she had the other woman now, and thus soon she&#39;d have a man.  She leaned in close to Miranda, until they were touching shoulder to shoulder, and put a hand on her knee &quot;It&#39;s Jessica&quot; she said, her now close face breathing the words from her lips to miranda&#39;s.  &quot;And you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda almost growled as she tersely spoke her own name, and then leaned in to capture the other woman&#39;s lips in a kiss, forgetting the road in her passion.  Jessica whimpered and submitted, but then her eyes widened as she noticed them drifting off the road.  with a muffled &quot;MMMMMPH!&quot; she grabbed the wheel and brought them back on course.<br />
<br />
The kiss was broken, and Miranda sheepishly regained control.  &quot;Maybe we should...pull over?&quot;  said Jessica.  Miranda nodded, and pulled into a cornfield.  As soon as she had stopped though, Jessica fled from the car with a giggle &quot;Catch me if you can!&quot; she shouted.  Miranda gave chase through the cornfield, chasing giggles and taunts, and only growing in horny frustration the whole time. Then she started to find pieces of clothing along the trail.  The other woman was apparently naked.  It was clear they were going to have sex now, and she craved it as she shed her own clothes.  In fact, her only regret was that there could be no sexual penetration as they were both women, and strangely enough she found herself wishing she had a cock to fuck her with.<br />
<br />
Then she turned through another row of corn, and plowed straight into Jessica.  They found themselves breathless on the ground, panting as they looked into each other&#39;s eyes.  Jessica was on top, her naked form bearing down on Miranda&#39;s, but with a growl Miranda swiftly changed that.  She leaned into Jessica&#39;s ear and whispered &quot;I&#39;m going to fuck you silly&quot;  Jessica moaned and her erecting nipples pressed into the other woman&#39;s.  Miranda marveled at the massive difference between their sizes, in fact...her own breasts seemed smaller than usual? well it must just be her imagination.  At any rate, she was past being jealous, and felt up the other woman with glee.  Then a strange instinct overtook her, and she began to dry hump. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Yeeees that&#39;s it, fuck me&quot; said Jessica, and, though it might be somewhat pointless, Miranda obliged, and found herself for some reason to be incredibly turned on by it all.  &quot;yeees that&#39;s it! take me stud!&quot; moaned Jessica.  So the pretenses were dropped now, and Miranda gave in, imagining herself fucking the little slut with a huge cock and swinging balls.  Faster and faster she humped, and so lost in it was she that she didn&#39;t even notice at first when something began to happen to her clit.  It was growing.  It grew bigger and bigger, peaking out of her feminine folds and soon rubbing against Jessica. Then it grew long enough to penetrate, and a jolt like electricity shot through Jessica&#39;s entire mind and body.  She felt as if a true man was born inside of her then, and now it battled with the woman for control.  The woman clung to existence, but the man wanted, needed to fuck Jessica, and lustfully he pushed Miranda the woman back.  She was in too much of a haze to quite grasp what was going on, but somehow she knew she was nearing the point of no return.  If she went any further she&#39;d be a man, and there&#39;d be no going back.   Jessica though, pushed her onwards.  &quot;Yes! Do it! Be a man!&quot;.  At her words and a second jolt of pleasure as she penetrated a second time, the inner battle tipped, and Miranda the woman lost as the man in her triumphantly thrust forward with all his might.  Her clit exploded forth into a huge cock, penetrating Jessica to the hilt, and two huge balls plopped out and slapped against Jessica&#39;s pussy. Miranda&#39;s breasts retracted into her, no, his body, and rippling muscles covered his form. &quot;Yes finally a man!&quot; Jessuca cried as they both exploded in orgasm and Miranda shot massive amounts of cum deep into Jessica&#39;s womb.</p>
