<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After over an hour of discussing potential plans, Harry Jenkins and Jenny Harper had a better idea of what they wanted. It would truly be a small wedding. The potential guest list was hovering at just under 50 people at the moment, with the biggest hang up being her side of the family.<br />
&quot;The moment any invitations hit Alabama, my folks will criticize, even if they&#39;re the first to receive theirs, and I still don&#39;t know how to explain <i>this,</i>&quot; said Jenny, holding up her furry were-vixen paws as she clutched her expanded bosom.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay honey. We&#39;ll think of something,&quot; promised her fiance Harry, as he took her paws in his. The couple had never bothered to switch back to their human forms after showing Jenny&#39;s roommate Karen Yuletide their new fursonas. Part of the reason was to give Jenny time to adjust more and in truth, Harry was enjoying being a werefox. <i>Now I see what my brother has been raving about all these years!</i> recalling that until just a day ago, he was the only were in the Jenkins family.<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s time to take a break,&quot; suggested Karen. &quot;I&#39;ve still got the other half of my foot long sub from lunch to eat in the fridge,&quot; she said, pointing to the little unit they shared in their assigned dorm room, &quot;but other than a couple of sodas...&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; replied Jenny, as she reverted back to her human, but seriously improved, body. &quot;I&#39;m really hungry. Want to go over to the Student Union and grab some dinner?&quot; she asked Harry.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Harry, as he started changing back too. &quot;Just give me a moment,&quot; as he pulled up his pants and reached down for his shoes.<br />
Karen silently noted that while not muscle bound, Harry was definitely more toned and a bit buffer than before he became a werefox to be with Jenny.<br />
&quot;Okay you two. Have fun, and I&#39;ll at least see you later,&quot; said Karen, hugging Jenny before they left.<br />
<br />
Alone in the little dorm room, Karen started straightening up a bit.<br />
She noticed all the bags of clothing that Jenny and Harry had brought in with them, and started organizing them better on Jenny&#39;s side of the room. A stylish pair of pink panties at the top of the contents in one bag caught her eye, which made Karen stop and take a closer look at them. The price tag from a boutique called Awareness was still on them, and she was surprised by the cost. Then Karen noticed the little slit in the rear, which might have otherwise stayed concealed if she wasn&#39;t holding them so closely.<br />
<i>For her tail!</i> realized Karen, as a smile crossed her face. Then she realized what a play on words the name of the boutique really was.<br />
She was uncertain if it was her first teddy bear or live kitten as a child that started it, but Karen Yuletide always had a fur fetish as far back as she could remember. The urge to feel the softness of a furry body against hers only grew stronger as she aged.<br />
While she had managed to keep it a secret from her family and anyone else (so far), her fur lust had affected her life both professionally, with the desire to become an animator of &quot;cute&quot; children&#39;s cartoons, because she wanted to draw anthropomorphic characters; and personally. Karen secretly owned a dildo with fur covered balls and a pair of furry gloves without fingertips, so she could seriously exercise her desires while pleasuring herself in more private moments. That was why she let her hair grow long, barely kept her vagina bush trimmed beyond health necessities, and was quickly turned on by men with hairy chests.<br />
<br />
As Karen started to move the last bag to the formerly empty space at the foot of Jenny&#39;s bed, she saw the bag contained some of her roommate&#39;s previous attire, along with a red, hardbound book on top.<br />
Curious, she picked up the book and read the title on the otherwise blank cover. A HANDBOOK TO WERE-SOCIETY IN MOON LAKE.<br />
Anxiously, Karen started flipping through the pages, getting more turned on as she started coming across the detailed photographs of a male and female were of each species standing together in all their fur clad glory at each listing.<br />
<i>I&#39;m like a kid in a candy store, with one hell of a sweet tooth and an unlimited allowance!</i><br />
Karen was seriously thinking about curling up with the book and her furry gloves, when there was a knock at the door.<br />
Quickly tossing the book back on top of the bag she found it in, Karen asked, &quot;Who is it?&quot; because Jenny would have just let herself and Harry back into the room.<br />
&quot;Is either Miss Harper or Mister Jenkins present?&quot; came the question in a formal tone of voice.<br />
Karen opened the dorm room door and saw an Oriental man, no taller than herself, dressed all in white, standing before her. &quot;Jenny is my roommate, but she&#39;s gone to dinner at the moment with Mister Harper. Can I help you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, I keep missing them,&quot; said the man, with a tone of disappointment. &quot;I was at his parents&#39; residence, only to be told they were here. Anyway, my name is Noriyuki Yasui, owner and head chef of the Diamond Catering Service of Moon Lake,&quot; he added, while giving Karen a business card. &quot;Mrs. Akane Tachibana has contracted my company for the Jenkins-Harper wedding, at no cost to the happy couple.&quot;<br />
&quot;REALLY?&quot; said Karen in surprise, while looking at the card.<br />
&quot;Yes, with my understanding that the nuptials are to be October 31st, it is imperative that either party contact me as soon as possible so we can discuss arrangements.&quot;<br />
&quot;As her Maid of Honor; Harper, Jenkins, and myself have already started making plans. No official color scheme yet, although we are planning to go daytime casual, within reason. No shorts or t-shirts. We also have a guest list started,&quot; said Karen, briefly running back to her desk for the notepad on it. &quot;The names on the left are definitely coming, while those on the right are unconfirmed at the moment,&quot; she added, before showing Yasui the list.<br />
&quot;May I?&quot; he asked, pulling out his cellphone to take a picture of it.<br />
Karen nodded her assent then, after taking the image, the caterer pulled out a pen and added a few names. &quot;Mrs. Tachibana herself will be in attendance,&quot; he said, moving her listing to the confirmed column, &quot;along with the Twist and Anderson families,&quot; he added, jotting those people down on the confirmed side. Karen knew Anderson was the last name of the teacher the three of them shared, and also Yvette Smith&#39;s other victim, but only knew the name Twist as the therapist Jenny was scheduled to see tomorrow. &quot;Unfortunately, I have not been informed yet if the Mayor and his family will be able to attend.&quot;<br />
&quot;The Mayor of Moon Lake?&quot; asked Karen in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yasui, before handing the notepad back to Karen.<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, just how big of a social event will this wedding be?&quot;<br />
&quot;Socially? I have no idea. Size wise, the wedding will be as big or small as the happy couple wish or need it to be. As leader of the Skulk, the catering is Mrs. Tachibana&#39;s wedding gift to them as part of her overall apology on behalf of all the werefoxes and werevixens of Moon Lake for Miss Harper&#39;s abrupt, unplanned transformation.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. Well, if you see her before we do, please thank Mrs. Tachibana for her generosity,&quot; said Karen.<br />
&quot;I will, and please have either or both of the engaged call me as soon as possible tomorrow morning after eight so my company can begin preparing. Good night,&quot; said Yasui, with a slight bow before turning to leave.<br />
<br />
Alone again, Karen placed the business card on top of Jenny&#39;s dresser, before grabbing the town handbook again and sitting with it at her desk.<br />
This time she carefully read the opening pages, that briefly discussed the origins of were society and Moon Lake, before she began reading the background information on weres.<br />
<i>On the first day of school, I honestly thought the college was playing a giant, but harmless, hazing trick on all the Freshmen, making us sign those non-disclosure agreements about were-beasts. But to find out they&#39;re <b>REAL!</b></i><br />
Then Karen&#39;s mood altered slightly as she finished the background information.<br />
<i>A bite, scratch, or sex does the trick, but I&#39;ll only have</i> one <i>chance to get it right! Once a person become a were, that&#39;s it! There are no do-overs!</i> she thought, slightly disappointed.<br />
<br />
After reading a few more pages...<br />
<i>If I&#39;m understanding all this right, the foxes mate for life with whoever they&#39;re already in love with, which explains Harry, Jenny, and Mister Anderson versus Yvette Smith,</i> realized Karen. <i>All the household based werecats seem to be bi, if not outright gay or lesbians; but thanks to the were birth control pill and the enhanced healing abilities of weres, I can safely play the field once I am one,</i> she thought, smiling at the possibilities, <i>because I don&#39;t want to limit my furry enjoyment to just one species, or gender, until I&#39;m ready to actually settle down. <b>BUT WHICH ONE?</b></i> she asked herself again, while drooling over the pictures of the various furry weres once more, until she heard Jenny&#39;s key start to enter the doorknob.<br />
With that, Karen rushed the town handbook back to where it was amongst Jenny&#39;s things and sat back down at her desk.<br />
Only when Jenny and Harry came back inside the room did her stomach growl, reminding Karen that she had yet to eat.<br />
<br />
