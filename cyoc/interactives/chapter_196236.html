<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Johnny woke up in the bed he had shared with Christine he saw that she had gone back to the gender booth as he was staring at a man. He sighed to himself having would&#39;ve preferred to have woken up to a woman next to him instead of a man. As Johnny moved around a bit more that woke up Christine who woke up and said &quot;Good morning, sweetie.&quot; <br />
Johnny a little annoyed said &quot;Good mornin-&quot; before cutting himself off as his voice was higher pitch. Consciousness being regained and being able to feel his body under the covers Johnny pushed the covers away and saw some B-cups under a blue nightgown. There was just one thought in Johnny&#39;s mind and that was &quot;I&#39;m a woman.&quot; he blushed a bit till his powers accidentally happened. Johnny could feel his power grip his mind and being and modify it a least a little. Johnny was a woman in body alone but some of his tastes, instincts, and muscle memory were being modified at least just a little. One such taste being her sexual preference, and now she could appreciate the large warm man she was sharing a bed with now. he was comforting... &quot;How did this happen?&quot; Johnny muttered wondering partially why he woke up as a woman and why her power acted up fully making her a her. <br />
Christine said &quot;Well... I wanted to figure out what I preferred more, and I thought I really couldn&#39;t without having someone I love be of the opposite gender like I could as a woman. So I took you into the booth and hit the gender change button. Your a rather heavy sleeper you know?&quot; Johnny imagined Christine having the drag him all the way to the booth and get him in, and he had to admit... He slept through a lot of dragging. <br />
Johnny said &quot;You know I could just turn myself back into a man right?&quot; <br />
&quot;So you want to be a woman?&quot; Christine asked<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll turn back right now.&quot; Johnny said and... Much like how man Johnny&#39;s brain sort of rejected the idea of being physically a woman female Johnny&#39;s brain was rejecting being a man. Being so bulky and big and... The idea of having a sausage down there felt so alien despite the vast majority of her life she had one. <br />
Christine just chuckled as Johnny&#39;s breasts flattened and said &quot;You aren&#39;t a man just because your flat chested.&quot; Johnny blushed a bit and was about to uncomfortably make herself a man again just to prove a point, but Christine said &quot;Did the machine change something in your head? It didn&#39;t do that to me.&quot; <br />
Johnny shook her head and said &quot;When I saw my body like this... I just thought that I was a woman and... Well I&#39;m a woman...&quot; <br />
Christine was now blushing a little at how cute his girlfriend was being and said &quot;Well I suppose we both get to figure out more about ourselves now. I get to see if my original self was male or female... and you can see if you are more comfortable truly as a woman.&quot; <br />
Johnny nodded and chuckled a bit and said &quot;I guess we will. Although I suppose we should at least get up and get dressed.&quot; <br />
<br />
Christine pretty quickly put on his clothes. Just pants and a shirt, and he waited outside by the restaurant for Johnny as it was Johnny who made mostly anything. It was taking what felt like awhile, and soon someone else came to the island. &quot;Um... hello?&quot; asked a Chris who came back to see how his best bud was doing and was surprised to see another man on the island. <br />
Christine smiled and said &quot;Hi Chris, surprised?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah sir... Did we meet before?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, It&#39;s me Christine. I&#39;m figuring out who I am so I&#39;m figuring out if I&#39;m more of a man or a woman.&quot; <br />
&quot;Ok... and Johnny is where?&quot; <br />
&quot;Johnny&#39;s getting dressed and it&#39;s taking awhile.&quot; <br />
Chris looked a little surprised since he never took Johnny as the type who took forever to get dressed, and as he looked around he asked &quot;What&#39;s up with that booth?&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, I was bugging Johnny about switching my sex too much so he just made what he drunkenly named the Sex chamber.&quot; <br />
&quot;Wait, you just go in and press a button and you can switch back and forth between being a man and a woman?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Unlike Johnny who rejected being a woman Chris didn&#39;t have an issue, and when presented with the option of getting a consequence free sex change took it as he went into the booth and pressed the sex change button. What came out was what looked like a less stacked female Christine that was a little chubbier and had a lot more freckles on her body. Then again Chris came out looking interested and feeling herself around. <br />
&quot;Woah this feels weird!&quot; Chris exclaimed as she examined her breasts contained in a plain shirt and her rounder ass enshrouded in a long skirt. <br />
&quot;Sex changing does get some getting used to&quot; Christine had to admit. <br />
<br />
A short bit afterwards Johnny came out of the castle in a shimmering blue dress that was reminiscent of the crystal blue sea that was right behind her, and she asked &quot;Hey Christine, I was wondering if my boobs or butt were too big?&quot; before she noticed that female Chris was there. &quot;Wait whos that?&quot;<br />
Chris said &quot;I&#39;m Chris Sis! Why didn&#39;t you tell me you were playing around with a sex changing booth?&quot;<br />
Johnny sighed and said &quot;Stop groping yourself and that was for Christine who wanted to see which form she preferred without bothering me every few minutes.&quot;<br />
&quot;You also seem to have enjoyed it.&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t! She brought me in while I was asleep!&quot;<br />
&quot;But you got all dolled up, added some makeup, and were worried about how big your boobs and butt were.&quot; <br />
Johnny blushed a bit as Christine said &quot;Her powers backfired. She thought &quot;I&#39;m a woman.&quot; when she woke up.&quot; At which point Chris just started laughing at Johnny&#39;s expense. <br />
Johnny pouted and said &quot;Well if you&#39;re going to act like a child.&quot; Johnny thought for a second and Chris stopped laughing as she felt her body start crushing in on itself as it shrank younger and younger. Her butt and breasts compressed back in as the years washed off her form. What was left was a 5 year old in an oversized shirt standing in a pool of skirt and undergarments. <br />
&quot;Not funny!&quot; Chris pouted<br />
&quot;You had your laugh, I&#39;m having my own fun.&quot; Johnny pointed out. As she had some more fun changing her in and out of clothes like dresses, into cute shorts and shirts with flowers and kitties on them, and then giving her different hairstyles till Johnny settled on keeping her having pigtails. <br />
Johnny then set up the table with Christine on one side being a masculine man, Johnny on the other side a pretty and busty young woman, and Chris sitting on Johnny&#39;s lap which all things considered he didn&#39;t mind too much. Chris imagine Johnny had developed her figure for Christine, but the plump thighs made for nice cushions and the breasts were so big they practically rested on Chris&#39; head.  Chris figured Johnny really had changed a bit as Johnny held her arms around Chris&#39; torso, and even fed her bits of pancakes. <br />
Johnny smiled and said &quot;Today&#39;s a holiday. What do you think we all should do?&quot;</p>
