<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Professor Scott waited patiently while his former student Tom eagerly slobbered all over his enormous cock, trying valiantly to get the larger than a fist sized head into his mouth, watching as his lips would get close to enveloping the smooth head only to fail to surround it making Tom back off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, that&#39;s really good! I&#39;m sure with a little training I&#39;ll have you balls deep on my cock in no time, but not today.&quot; Scott said as he pulled Tom from his soaked cock.<br />
<br />
Tom wondered if that was it, if his former professor was going to let him just leave and that be then end of this humiliation, a whine that his body shared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry boy, you aren&#39;t done earning your gift, turn around.&quot; Professor Scott commanded.<br />
<br />
Toms body eagerly complied and turned so his dirty bare ass faced his Professors mammoth cock.<br />
<br />
Professor Scott watched as the dirty cheeks gave way to a smooth, glistening wrinkled pink hole, It didn&#39;t look like the tattoo suggested, but didn&#39;t look virgin tight either, &quot;That&#39;s a nice looking hole you have there boy, how about we make it as your tattoo suggests?&quot; Professor Scott asked.<br />
<br />
Tom internally screamed as his body happily waited, he could feel his cock throbbing and his tongue dripping on the floor which he started licking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure this &#39;Big Hole&#39; of yours makes enough of its own lube to handle me just fine!&quot; Professor Scott said as he watched the pink hole twitch and a bead of clear lube ran down Toms crack. &quot;Oh yes, just fine indeed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom waited, both fearfully and eagerly at what he knew was coming, though he wasn&#39;t ready for the moment that cock entered his hole.<br />
<br />
Professor Scott pushed his cock head into the smooth lubed hole in front of it, meeting a little resistance, nothing his strong muscled arms couldn&#39;t easily overcome. He grabbed Tom&#39;s hips and pulled him back until his cock head popped in, then persistently pulled the big hole back along his giant cock, stopping at intervals to push Tom back to help lube up his shaft some more before continuing to impale him.<br />
<br />
Tom for the most part mentally was in tune with his body as that cock molded his insides to please it, he felt it moving inside him, pulsing and throbbing as its head stretched parts of him he didn&#39;t even know existed before this. The part of him that hated what was happening for the moment was moaning along with his body as his former professor filled him with his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy! You are doing great, keep this up and you will have the other 2 thirds of my cock in you soon!&quot; Scott said as he pulled back and pushed more of his cock in. <br />
<br />
Tom was too wrapped up in what he was feeling to really care what Professor Scott said.<br />
<br />
Professor Scott continued to push and pull and tease his cock into Toms big hole, all the while making it a bigger hole, stretching it wider and opening up his depths to the massive intruder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; Professor Scott repeated over and over as inch by inch his cock slid into Tom, deeper and deeper as the he moaned and panted lapping at his puddle of drool and occasionally stretching his tongue to the growing puddle of precum and piss his cock was squirting on the floor beneath him. <br />
<br />
After a short time, or a lifetime depending on whos point of view you were living it from, Professor Scott proclaimed, &quot;Balls deep finally!&quot;<br />
<br />
Toms ass tried to clamp down on the invader as tightly as it could, as his own long filthy cock blasted his chin with cum, &quot;Ah yes, finally I&#39;m balls deep in your big hole, I&#39;ll just let you get use to it being there before we get started I can feel you twitching and pulsing around me, though i&#39;m sure it&#39;s as hard as you can, it really feels pretty weak to me.&quot; Professor Scott said as he waited for Tom to stop cumming.<br />
<br />
Tom would have been embarrassed if he could have focused on more than blowing his load all over the floor and himself, but that was about all his body would let him do as his ass tried to grip the wide cock in it.<br />
<br />
Several minutes passed before the hole on his cock stopped throbbing, the constant pressure keeping Professor Scotts cock hard and leaking deep inside it. &quot;Alright, now we can really get started!&quot; The professor started as he would any lecture.<br />
<br />
He started by pushing Tom as far off his cock as he could before he slid it all the way back in in a single fluid motion, burying himself back to balls deep in a few seconds, each time he would pull out Tom would whimper which would change to a loud moan as he slammed back in, over and over this continued for more than an hour. <br />
<br />
Professor Scott knew he had no more classes for the day and he wasn&#39;t too concerned with what Tom had to do given the state he found him in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here it comes boy!&quot; Professor Scott announced as he slammed his massive cock hard back into Toms big hole and blasted an equally massive load deep in him.<br />
<br />
Tom moaned as the huge cock pulsed and thickened in him and he felt the torrent of hot cum fill his insides, as he felt that his own cock again blasted him and the floor with another load that he eagerly licked up. <br />
<br />
Professor Scott came for a few minutes before it stopped and his cock started to soften to half hard, &quot;Good boy, I think you took that very well!&quot; He said as Tom panted and licked the floor.<br />
<br />
Tom dazedly turned and smiled with his tongue hanging from his mouth, before he tried to move from his position. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, did I say you could go? I haven&#39;t given you your gift yet.&quot;</p>
