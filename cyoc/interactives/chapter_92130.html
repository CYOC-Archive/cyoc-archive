<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fuck,&quot; James thought, &quot;Not worth my time.&quot; and with that he began to cruise down the beach.  When it came to the list of his top priorities, namely beer, bros, and hos, hos definitely came first came first at the beach, and with his suddenly raging libido, he was definitely looking to score.  Unfortunately for the new James before he&#39;d walked another fifty feet a pair of twinky looking surfer bois came running past toward the water.  He didn&#39;t think much of them until he saw the matching rainbow anklets the boys were wearing.  For the new James that was the last straw.  &quot;What&#39;s with all these fags taking over &#39;my&#39; beach!,&quot; he raged internally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey fag boys,&quot; he shouted in their direction, &quot;Don&#39;t you know your not welcome here!&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the boys heard James&#39; shout while his friend, already closer to the water, hadn&#39;t been able to hear James of the sound of the crashing surf.  The first boy stopped in his tracks as soon as James had finished speaking.  Usually he wouldn&#39;t have given someone like the new homophobic James the satisfaction of a response, but before he knew what he was doing he&#39;d turned to face James and found himself replying, &quot;Good look&#39;in out bro!  Gotta teach these fags to keep off our beach!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the boy began to clutch his head.  James looked on dumbfounded as the tall but twinky blond beach bunny in short-sleeved wetsuit started to change before his eyes.  The fist thing he noticed is the boy seemed to be swelling, growing more muscular by the second.  Before long his tight wetsuit began to audibly groan as he began to outgrow its neoprene confines.  Awestruck as he was by the sudden continued muscle growth, jock James was even more shocked as he watched a pair of metallic blue Asics cross trainers seem to grow out from the sand under the boy&#39;s bare feet quickly encasing them in a fresh pair of clearly oversized kicks.  The disparity between the size of the shoes and the boy&#39;s  feet was quickly reminded however as the feet themselves grew to size 12, much more appropriate for the stereotypical jock he was rapidly becoming and a perfect match for the new shoes.  As his previously firm but small legs were completing their growth into tree trunks of sinewy muscle, the rainbow anklet he&#39;s worn with pride exploded off his leg as pair of crew length Nike socks sprang up out of the shoes.   The wetsuit itself had spit into two pieces around his waistline.  Even as his legs grew the lower half of the wetsuit continued to become progressively looser around his thighs.  The fabric was losing it distinctive thickness and texture, thinning out and becoming shinier every moment.  The loose shorts extended to just below his knees and a white Nike swoosh appeared near the bottom of the left leg of his new basketball shorts.<br />
<br />
The boy moaned as pecs shot our from his chest and biceps swelled.  While his shorts had become much looser what was left of the top half of the wetsuit remained tight.  The boy looked on in confusion and horror as the sleeved disappeared into nothing and the neckline began to drop down into a scoop.  Like the shorts, the neoprene fabric became much thinner.  The now sleeveless top instantly breached into a pristine white as the texture began to ripple. His eyes grew wide when he realized he was now clad in an unmistakable jock wardrobe consisting of cross-trainers, basketball shorts, and a tight wife beater.  It was at that moment that the reality of what was occurring truly sunk in.  He looked around desperately for his friend, but caught sight of James first, and it was at that moment that the new jock personality which had been growing within the confines of his shrinking mind began to overshadow the innocent sensitive boy he had been.<br />
<br />
With a confidence unknown to him before he stepped towards to still confused James and raised his swelling hand for a bro five with the man he suddenly realized was one of his closest buds.  The changes had finally begun to affect James&#39; mind as well, and he too began to move towards the budding bro in order to complete the exchange.  As their hands collided the changes accelerated.  The long blond shag on the surfer boi come jock&#39;s head instantly darkened to black and pulled into his scalp until it was just an inch in length.  A moment later gel appeared and what was left of his hair spiked all over into an unmistakable jock cut.  His skin didn&#39;t change much, already well tanned from the days spent on his board and at the beach, but a coating of black hair covered his legs, a treasure trail grew up from a suddenly engorged member stopping at his navel, and a light coating appeared on the massive pythons that had replaced his once small, toned arms.<br />
<br />
A wind picked up and seemed to swirl around the two jocks as they completed their exchange.  A gold chain dropped around the newest jock&#39;s neck and the fire of sensitivity behind his eyes dulled into a cold malice.  The new jock was finally complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo Nick,&quot; James said, &quot;Look at that twink there by the swell... think it&#39;s about time we teach em&#39; a lesson.&quot;  <br />
<br />
For the new jock there was a sudden moment of confusion followed by complete clarity.  He was Nick of course... why he would have thought his name sounded wrong was beyond him.  As far as he was concerned he&#39;s always been Nick, super jock, and James was one of his closest bros.  They shared the same priorities and the same opinions when it came to fags.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya bro, its time everybody learnt&#39; this beach is for real jocks!.. no fags allowed!&quot;</p>
