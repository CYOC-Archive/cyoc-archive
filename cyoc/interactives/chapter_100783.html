<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With her roommate Jenny Harper spending the night at her fiance&#39;s house, Karen Yuletide took full advantage of being alone in their dorm room after her latest date with Peter Talbot, especially after that wild lesson he gave her about weres and werelions.*<br />
Alone she quickly stripped, took her <i>special</i> dildo (the one with the furred lined base) and proceeded to treat herself to a wild, if solo, session of hot sex.<br />
It wasn&#39;t just the thought of becoming a werelioness anymore that drove her from one self-induced orgasm to another.<br />
It was the thought of becoming HIS werelioness, for Karen Yuletide was genuinely starting to fall in love with Peter Talbot.<br />
With and, most importantly, withOUT fur.<br />
If she had stopped and actually thought about it, Karen would be the first to comment that it was simply amazing, considering that she not only had known Peter for less than 48 hours at this point, but that SHE was now in full control of her fur fetish, not the other way around.<br />
Yet despite the wild night and lots of dreams about possibly someday becoming Mrs. Karen Talbot, by 10 am that Thursday morning, Karen found herself in her customary place in her favorite class: art.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay students,&quot; began their art instructor. &quot;As promised, Tuesday we had the man, so today is the woman&#39;s turn for life model figure drawing,&quot; he said, as a good looking woman with jet black hair came out of the storeroom behind him, wearing only a bathrobe.<br />
The model took her place on the small stage before the art class, and then dropped her robe to the ground, revealing a body in great physical shape without being overtly musclebound, and a bosom that was getting more than a glance from the straight guys, and a couple of the women present too.<br />
&quot;Same rules as Tuesday,&quot; the instructor reminded them. &quot;Liz will change poses every 15 minutes until the hour&#39;s up, so keep drawing until I say otherwise. Begin!&quot;<br />
Karen began drawing like everyone else, paying close attention to detail. The curve of the subject&#39;s hips, the subtly of one hand being in a slightly different position than the other, the way the model positioned her legs and feet, and a host of other details.<br />
Every once in a while, a stray thought of Peter crossed her mind, but Karen figured that was only because Talbot was the male model on Tuesday, which is how they met.**<br />
<br />
When the hour was up, the instructor said, &quot;Okay. Since this IS Moon Lake, I&#39;m sure everybody is ahead of me on this,&quot; as the model began to transform before their eyes. Soon, there was a beautiful werelioness standing before them!<br />
Her hair had shrank somewhat, compared to her overall head, for technically lionesses didn&#39;t have manes. Only the male lions did. What was originally shoulder length now looked more like a short page cut. She was now also taller and more bountiful than before.<br />
But all the other feline features one would expect were there: fur, long tail, paws, cat-like eyes, muzzle, whiskers, etc.<br />
Karen began drawing the model in all her furry glory, paying even closer attention now than earlier.<br />
<i>That could be me, with Peter, someday,</i> thought Karen as she drew.<br />
The paws, the way the fur was piled on her arms and legs. The position of the ears, as if ever alert even when there was no reason to be. The gentle swish of Liz&#39;s tail from time to time, Karen tried to capture all this and more with her drawings.<br />
Yet even as she drew, stray thoughts of Peter kept crossing her mind as well.<br />
But this time they were different.<br />
Now Karen saw this human bowing down before Peter and herself, all of them fully dressed.<br />
Then, for whatever reason(s), Karen saw Liz, Peter, and herself engaging in sexual acts together as a werelion threesome, before he finished by plunging his still hard lion cock deep within Liz&#39;s depths! Yet, even after all that hot sweaty sex, it was still Karen that Peter took home before making sweet, romantic love to before they fell asleep in each others furry arms.<br />
Karen tried shaking her head to clear it. <i>Peter warned me about the sexual promiscuity of male lions versus their romantic interests. Guess I still haven&#39;t fully come to terms with an &quot;open&quot; lion relationship yet.</i><br />
Karen Yuletide kept drawing the werelioness until the end of class, thankful that she never committed any of those new stray thoughts to paper.<br />
<br />
As the instructor came around to examine everyone&#39;s work, Liz went back into the storeroom to get dressed.<br />
&quot;Great work, as usual,&quot; the instructor whispered, after looking at Karen&#39;s drawings, before going on to the next student.<br />
After looking over everyone&#39;s drawings and reminding his students that their outdoor landscape sketches were due next Tuesday, the instructor dismissed the class for the day.<br />
Karen started gathering her things as everyone began filing out of the art room. She was about to leave herself when suddenly, someone grabbed her by her ponytail and said, &quot;So you&#39;re the one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuletide turned and saw an angry, but fully dressed, Liz standing there as she released Karen&#39;s hair.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re first, last, and <i>only</i> warning. Stay away from Peter Talbot! He&#39;s mine!&quot; growled Liz, as her eyes started to take on a reddish, feral glow.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it to you?&quot; Karen asked defiantly, even as she started thinking about how she could defend herself versus how far away she was from the open classroom door.<br />
Liz gave Karen a quick sniff before saying, &quot;Peter was raving about this fantastic art student he met and was crazy about, so I lowered myself to take this assignment today to check you out. Imagine my shock to discover that you&#39;re not only a commoner, but a normal as well! Peter&#39;s slumming again, but as his future Queen I can overlook it. <i>This</i> time,&quot; she growled, more menacingly than before.<br />
Karen loved the part about <i>this fantastic art student he was crazy about</i>, but wasn&#39;t about to give anyone, especially this crazed woman, the satisfaction of seeing her afraid. Instead, she stood to her full height and said, &quot;Isn&#39;t that between me and Peter?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. It is NOT!&quot; replied Liz, taking a threatening step closer to Karen. &quot;My liege is <b>WAY</b> out of your league, but if you <i>really</i> want to be a were, I know this French wereskunk who would gladly mate with you. I wonder how you&#39;d look in black and white fur and unable to stand the scent of your own body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That woman is under the FULL protection of my pride and myself. If anyone does anything to Karen Yuletide against her will, they WILL answer to <b>ME!</b>&quot; growled Peter Talbot, as he entered the art room, his eyes a feral red as he stared angrily at Liz.<br />
&quot;My Lord!&quot; yelled Liz, taking a step back and bowing as Peter drew closer.<br />
&quot;You have not only broken our personal laws, but incurred my wrath as well,&quot; said Peter in an angry voice as he placed himself between Liz and Karen. &quot;Go, NOW, and await judgement!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; replied Liz in a quaking voice. Karen could tell she was the scared one now as Liz bowed again and left the art room as fast as she could.<br />
Then Peter turned and looked longingly at Karen, his eyes their normal hazel shade again. &quot;Are you all right my love?&quot; he asked, in a sweet and kind voice as he held her close to him.<br />
<i>My love?</i> Karen thought happily, as she looked up at the taller man and said, &quot;I am now,&quot; as she laid her head against Peter&#39;s chest.<br />
&quot;She didn&#39;t hurt you or anything, did she?&quot; asked Peter, stroking Karen&#39;s hair even as he took a discreet sniff to make sure she was still fully human.<br />
&quot;No. Not physically,&quot; replied Karen, as she looked up at Peter again. &quot;Care to tell me what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
