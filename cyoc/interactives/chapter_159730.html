<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You gazed around the room. Noticing something black hanging from one of the alien hangers. Upon closer inspection you see that it&#39;s a completely black panty with some sort of harness hanging separate on the hanger. On the shelf above it sat some sort of mask. You reach up and grab the mask. Its completely smooth with two triangular spikes on top. They seemed reminiscent of ears but without the holes. aside from that the mask had no particular features on it&#39;s front. Turning around you see that the inside of the mask sports some sort of visor or screen. Likely for seeing, but what took all of your attention was the odd cylinder where your mouth would be if you but it on. Was that what was going to keep it from falling off of your face if you put it on since there was no strap?<br />
<br />
You sat the mask back on the shelf and took the harness and panty off the hanger. They were of a smooth black material that also stretched. They looked like latex but didn&#39;t creak like it. The harness was mainly made up of a smooth black solid material making up sections of it together with the same flexible material which made up the panty. Looking closely they seemed about your size. There was hopefully a bra like it too since you felt tempted to put it on. You hesitantly put the harness back on the hanger and lower the black panty. Then you slid your skinny legs through it&#39;s two holes and felt it automatically adjust to your size. Sitting firmly and comfortably on your crotch and covering your  holes perfectly. <br />
<br />
You noticed how several small rings on it&#39;s side straps lit up in crimson luminosity. You thought it looked cool so you didn&#39;t mind it and merely smiled. You stood up on your toes and looked over the shelf. Seeing just random stuff and nothing of noteworthy attention other than the same black face plate. Seeing no black bra you look back at the harness, noting that several lines had lit up like the small rings on your panty.<br />
<br />
You take the harness off the hanger again and look closer at it. It would slot in around your chest, not covering it. It also had an opened collar ring attached to the top strap which went around over your chest. You hesitantly take the harness on. Hoping that it maybe covered your bust with a bra that would fit perfectly.<br />
<br />
opening the back two straps you close it around you, letting it adjust to perfectly fit your body. You looked down at your c-cup breasts hopingly. You waited for several seconds of nothing happening. You sigh. Then you pondered. &#39;&#39;Do you need to put the mask on?&#39;&#39; You look at the shelf and grab the mask. Looking at it. two small rings had lit up on it&#39;s sides where your ears would approximately be. The triangular spikes on it&#39;s top had a line at their top shining in crimson light like the other lights. You turned it around. Noticing that the screen had lit up in a dim cyan. You raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The lizard waited in the cockpit. pressing buttons and tapping screens as she intently eyed the screens showing all sorts of information. Her attention shifted to another screen which had suddenly lit up. Lines of symbols which you wouldn&#39;t have understood told her that one of the automatic alert systems had registered unauthorized presence in the wardrobe. <br />
<br />
She would have normally waved it off as she knew it was the human but the specific machine which had given the alert was a special suit. An infiltrator suit which also doubled as a servant and pleasure suit. The lizard grinned and pondered her two choices. Either activate the suits anti-theft protocol for a little while or just leave it be and give the human a little informative warning.<br />
<br />
The lizard leaned back and put her finger to her muzzle in consideration. Then she showed a toothy grin as she leaned back forwards and tapped some buttons.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In the wardrobe you were pondering if your should try and put the mask on or not. Then your noticed the mask vibrating shortly. You looked back at it which you were holding in your hands. Looking at the screen you saw a white odd symbol flashing on it. You squinted at held the mask closer to your face. Then the symbol stopped flashing. You looked confused at the mask.  Then suddenly numerous lines of the same smooth black material as the panty but with a more darker tone with a hexagonal pattern shot out of the masks edges and wrapped around your head, forcing itself onto your face as the cylinder extended into some sort of tentacle and forced itself into your mouth and down your throat, attaching itself in your lungs, supplying them directly with clean air and filtered out Co2.<br />
<br />
more of the straps then burst out of the harness and panty, quickly covering your body and merging with each other. Making it look like you were wearing a full body suit with a feline like mask. (only because of the two triangular &#39;&#39;ears&#39;&#39;) You had gotten barely enough time to react and only shortly choked on the masks tentacle. The suit had then seemingly stopped all of your movements. Forcing you into a straight position with arms to your sides.<br />
<br />
A section of the wardrobe wall then slid open, a robotic arm folding out. The arm then bent behind you and attached to one of the straps of the harness. It then lifted you up and lifted you to a pod which had newly opened. Revealing a large crevice which was shaped to your body. The arm then sets you ontop of a small plate, disconnecting and folding back up as your body was turned around by a small turn table and slid into the crevice which was then covered by the plate. Then the machine which you were now trapped in was covered up.<br />
<br />
And thus several minutes passed before the lizard entered the wardrobe. She walked over to the wardrobe wall and placed her hand on in. Then it opened, revealing the rectangular box in which you were trapped. A screen on the pods surface lights up and the lizard taps a couple of the buttons. Then the screen showed several sliders and an array of different checkboxes with their individual texts.<br />
<br />
She ponders as she looks over them. Then she grins as she slides some of the sliders up and begins checking some of the checkboxes. Then she hit a big green button when she was done and the screen turned off. Several small lights on the pod lit up. Then the lizard walked back a few steps and looked at the pod as it eventually slid up after several seconds. You were tiredly looking at the internal screen of the mask which seemed so bright in the almost complete darkness you were in. You had desperately tried to escape the grip of the suit but after the minutes that had gone by you had given up on the futile task. Then you felt you had been pricked in 4 places. Your nipples and your butt. <br />
<br />
You were confused why you suddenly had felt prodding but that confusion was quickly replaced with ecstacy as you felt your body change. You could feel your butt rounded out and became more plump, your hips became wide and motherly as your waist narrowed some more. Your thighs became thicker and stronger as you became taller as well. Then you bust expanded into oblong, plump melons in width and several inches longer. Jutting exceptionally well out of your chest as the suit stretched some more. Then as the ecstatic feeling died down you noticed how it seemed like you no longer were wearing the mask. Unfortunately you were still wearing it but your sight was no longer obstructed by the dim cyan screen. You saw the lizard smiling at you. You looked around and noticed that you were still in the wardrobe but within some sort of crevice.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Enjoyed your stay?&#39;&#39; The lizard murred as she walked up to you. Swaying her hips sexily and with a smile. When she was right in front of you you noticed how you seemed to be the same height as her, then she lifted her hand and placed it on your mask, stroking it. &#39;&#39;You look mighty sexy besides being faceless and clad in a ominous black suit that glows red. But i love ominous looking things among pristine objects.  Too bad i can&#39;t legally have ominous things like torture stuff. And dont worry. You aren&#39;t my slave nor would i torture you. I like the view but i cant stand such horrific things actually happening.&#39;&#39; She said lovingly but with a bit of disgust at the end. You were unsure if you should be scared by what she said. &#39;&#39;I could always need an extra hand so I thought it&#39;d be handy if I made you my crew. I think it fitting if you remained in that suit for half the journey.&#39;&#39; She smiled. Then backed away and pressed a button.<br />
<br />
suddenly you felt your suit unlocking and you stumbled forwards. Unused to the added weight of your large assets. You then noticed the clawed boots you were wearing. And the additional plates which littered your body. Your hands covered in smooth black gauntlets with glowing red edges. Every part of you not the slick black suit had something glowing red. You inspected your body. &#39;&#39;Come on, let&#39;s put you to work.&#39;&#39; the lizard says as she walks to the wardrobe door. &#39;&#39;Oh and also. As you&#39;ll soon notice, you are unable to talk while you wear that suit.&#39;&#39; She informs you as the wardrobe door opens and she walks out of it. Looking back to you. Hesitantly you internally sigh and walk after her.</p>
