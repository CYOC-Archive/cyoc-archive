<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a relief to finally get home, though it always kinda depressed me on how much effort it sometimes took to get out of the car these days. My mom had to help pull me up, because I didn&#39;t have the body strength to do it by myself anymore. And thankfully we were able to do this in the garage, because I could only imagine the stares I would get from people if this was going on outside - seeing me struggle and grunt while my tits jiggled around like a couple of beach balls. Then it was a somewhat subdued walk to my room, leaving my mom behind, who was muttering darkly about the doctors opinion and what she thought of him. I felt bad for her - she was trying really hard to help me, but at every turn it seemed like there wasn&#39;t anything that could help. <br />
<br />
I made it to my room and lowered myself into my computer chair with a sigh of relief. It really was a struggle to get around with these things. As I sat there in the chair, I could feel them brushing up against my thighs every time I took a breath. They were impossible to ignore at the best of times. <br />
<br />
Uncle Jim had gotten me the chair. It had a metal base and was wider than most chairs, letting me actually sit on it without worrying too much. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve had an uneasy relationship with chairs over the past few months. More than one plastic chair had met it&#39;s demise at the growing weight of my chest. <br />
<br />
It was also getting kind of hard to use my computer - at least, in the sense that reaching the keyboard was becoming difficult. If I hadn&#39;t learned how to type without having to look at the keyboard, I probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to use it at all. No joke, last week, when I was trying to browse around a bit, my tits kept accidentally mashing some of the buttons. Try making THAT excuse in an online chat. <br />
<br />
The doorbell rang, and my heart rose a bit. Hopefully it was my friends.<br />
<br />
I heard my mom answer the door and a moment later Lucy, Ashley, and Brooke entered, smiling at me. I would&#39;ve liked to have gotten up and hugged them, but well, you know. Fortunately, they were pretty good about it. Lucy and Brooke lounged on the bed while Ashley sat with gay swagger in my other chair. They got me caught up on some school gossip, since I hadn&#39;t been in a couple weeks. It kinda hurt to hear about some of the stuff they&#39;d been up to at school while I&#39;d been stuck at home, but I was glad they were still wanting to hang out with me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, by the way, Ash got suspended,&quot; Lucy said in an overly casual tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley rolled her eyes self-consciously. &quot;Jennifer Smith was talking shit about you again. I warned her, talk shit, get hit. Guess she didn&#39;t believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I found myself smiling. &quot;Ash! You didn&#39;t have to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She blew a tuft of dirty blonde hair out of her eyes and fixed me with a sharp glare. &quot;Yeah I did,&quot; she said simply. I just smiled. I saw Lucy shaking her head with a slight smile. She knew about my crush. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...thanks for defending my honor,&quot; I told her with grave seriousness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime,&quot; Ashley said, bowing her head slightly. And maybe it was my imagination, but her cheeks seemed a little pink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brooke&#39;s going to a championship swim meet this weekend,&quot; Lucy went on. &quot;She&#39;s been killing it lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke shrugged. &quot;Thanks...I mean...I&#39;m just trying my best, y&#39;know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please girl, your best is leagues ahead of anyone else,&quot; Ashley said with a dismissive wave of her hand. &quot;I guess I know why you always choose to dress up as a mermaid for Halloween and costume parties. You practically are one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke smiled, but looked a little uncomfortable as she brushed her hair back. &quot;Well...&quot; She&#39;d always been a little shy about boasting about her affinity for swimming. She really was great at it though. I was jealous. If I tried to swim right now I&#39;m not sure what would happen. Either I&#39;d sink like the titanic or my tits would keep me afloat like life rafts. Neither possibility sounded all that fun. Besides, there wasn&#39;t a bikini in the world that could fit me at the moment.<br />
<br />
They stayed and talked with me for a bit more, but eventually Brooke and Ashley had to leave. Lucy stayed behind for a bit more, wanting to talk to me privately.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...Bronwyn...how are you doing, really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly? I&#39;m kinda scared,&quot; I admitted. &quot;I had another appointment today. They still can&#39;t find any signs of what might be causing...this,&quot; I said, gesturing at my chest. &quot;Like...they&#39;ve gotta find something eventually, right? This isn&#39;t normal...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy nodded, looking sad. &quot;Yeah...I&#39;m sorry. I wish there was something I could do to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact that you guys still come to see me is important to me,&quot; I told her earnestly. &quot;I&#39;m kinda a freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, you&#39;re our freak,&quot; Lucy said with a smile.<br />
<br />
We talked a bit more, and she took off. <br />
<br />
God, I hoped that someone would be able to figure this out. They had to stop growing at some point.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
TWO DAYS LATER<br />
<br />
When I woke up, the increased sensation of weight on my chest filled me with dread. This was becoming too common of an occurrence! Blinking back sleep, I sat up somewhat, only to discover that my chest had grown by several inches, and they looked visibly larger on my thin frame. It took all of my strength to sit up, upon which my breasts flopped forward to fully rest on the tips of my legs. I let out a moan as I looked down at them - not only was the increased weight pretty uncomfortable, but the sensations of my nipples had gotten stronger as well - just sitting there and feeling my sheets tickle them....<br />
<br />
Somehow, I knew it wasn&#39;t going to work out too well, but I tried it anyway. I tried to stand up.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t. Each time I tried, my legs began to shake from the strain and my back protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; I whispered, looking down at the boulders my breasts had become. I&#39;d thought...thought that maybe it would take at least another week or so before this point. Maybe it wasn&#39;t my imagination. Maybe they were starting to grow faster. <br />
<br />
I sat there for...I&#39;m not sure for how long. Just sitting there and staring at my tits. I tried to get up a few more times, but had no success. I looked at my topless form in the mirror. My eyes looked hollow and tired, and a decent part of my face was obscured from my view by my own breasts. No matter how many times I looked at myself in the mirror like this, it never felt real. I&#39;d seen girls with breasts as large as their head before - there were subreddits for that very thing for the pervy dudes on reddit. But I&#39;d never really seen many non-photoshopped girls who had breasts so large that their nipples looked as large as their head. But like I said before, they looked perfectly normal, aside from their impossible size. They weren&#39;t sagging overly much, they weren&#39;t covered in rashes or stretch marks...they were just...too fucking big. <br />
<br />
Eventually my mom came in to see why I hadn&#39;t gotten out of bed yet. She came in with a questioning look and saw my resigned and angry tear-streaked face. A look of depressed realization crossed her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you...?&quot; she started to ask.<br />
<br />
I shook my head, my voice shaking. &quot;No,&quot; I muttered angrily. &quot;I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t fucking stand up.&quot; I sniffed. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying, and trying, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes, muttering a few choice curse words, before nodding. &quot;Okay. Okay. Um. Okay. Hang on.&quot; She turned and walked off. <br />
<br />
I sat there in bitter silence until she returned, with a wheelchair in tow. <br />
<br />
It took a few moments for mom to get enough of a grip to get me up long enough to maneuver into the chair. My breasts rested on my legs rather uncomfortably, but...after experimenting a bit, I was able to wheel myself around without too much of an issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mom,&quot; I whispered. It was hard to muster up any kind of excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah kid,&quot; she said, looking glum. &quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t really do much for the rest of the day after that. I didn&#39;t use the computer or text any of my friends. I just sat there and sulked - breasts so large they were actively preventing me from getting around now. This should&#39;ve been impossible, but...well, impossible was quickly becoming an irrelevant term when it came to my tits. <br />
<br />
What the fuck was I going to do if this continued? Even a wheelchair wouldn&#39;t be enough to help me then.</p>
