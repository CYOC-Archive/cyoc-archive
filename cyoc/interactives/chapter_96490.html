<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Within an hour of leaving his teacher&#39;s class he began to feel a difference. During his next class he absentmindedly starting using his hand to prop his his face up during a boring lecture on the fundamentals of accounting. <br />
<br />
Ed felt a prickling sensation on his face, his face had the feeling of sandpaper, a really thick piece of sandpaper at that. Soon the class ended and Ed took the time to go check himself out in the bathroom. His hair color seemed maybe a little darker than it normally was. He was also gaining back his hairline that had started receding since he started college(or at least that is what his new memories had told him). <br />
<br />
He liked the sensation of rubbing his hands on his now rougher face. He couldn&#39;t wait till he could grow a fuller beard. <br />
<br />
Ed washed his hands and left to go back to his new dorm room. Ed&#39;s roommate wasn&#39;t around so Ed decided to take a nap so that he would accelerate the process. Maybe he had made it last too long, he now thought. <br />
<br />
After sleeping for three hours Ed woke from his nap, his body felt much warmer than its usually temperature especially concentrated at his chest and lower stomach. Ed pulled back the covers to see what looked like stubble forming a line from his pubic hair up to his pecs and fanning out across his chest, almost as if he had been shaving in. He almost noticed that almost all of his hair was now pitch black. <br />
<br />
Ed decides to check on Dr. Battisa and see how the transfer was working on him. Ed goes by his office and makes conversation with him at length. <br />
<br />
Dr. Battisa now plainly light brown hair, which was getting lighter in the areas where it was receding. His luxurious beard was now a thing of the past, only now a patchy, shortly trimmed, beard that the professor was keeping for having a beards sake. <br />
<br />
He still looked manly, Dr. Battisa was fit and not having as much hair enhanced his muscular features more. He also left his top button unbuttoned on purpose, to show off that he still had chest hair, even if it wasn&#39;t as luscious as it had been before. <br />
<br />
Afterwards Ed decided to speed through the changes by taking some sleeping pills so that he could sleep through the whole ideal, reaching his full potential without the wait. <br />
<br />
Ed wakes up maybe an hour after Dr. Battisa&#39;s class would have started. When he wakes he looks down and doesn&#39;t have any recognition of his body. An abundant amount of hair adorned his body, thickening greatly on his pecs and traveling up just enough to where it would be impossible to wear a shirt that could hide it. There was a wide and deep strip that ran down the middle of his chest and continued down to his pubes which were widely out of control and needed a good trimming. <br />
<br />
He walked over to the full body mirror in his room and observed himself in motion. His beard had come in incredibly thick and would need immediate attention. He rubbed his hands through its soft curls, loving every moment of it. His brows also now came in thick and heavy giving him a pensive worried look. <br />
<br />
He looked down at his arms and legs which were equally as hairy as the rest of him. As he looked down his shoulders to his arms the dark hairs became progressively thicker. Especially at the forearms, the top part of his hand, and the digits that were part of it. <br />
<br />
Staring at his legs was the same result, leaving him with hairy hobbit feet. <br />
<br />
There was even some hair on his lower back, which he assumed would increase with his age, seeing as his was only 19 and was already this hairy. He was now as hairy as Dr. Battisa had been at the age of 19.</p>
