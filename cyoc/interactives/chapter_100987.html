<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick calmed himself down after the heavy experience he went through the entire two days. <br />
<br />
First he turned into a dumb homophobic jock because of James, whom later became Jose at the mall, a Mexican homeboy. After being separated with the only other man whose cursed with this weird spell, he tried to warn his boyfriend but it ended up in naught. As he turned into a Chinese Loan shark and ended up TFing his Boyfriend Corey into one of his clients, who goes by the name &quot;Tanaka Koreya&quot;. <br />
<br />
And judging from the roughness of his voice, it&#39;s safe to assume that Corey&#39;s now an older middle-aged Japanese man. Although from the way he speaks, considering that there was a western-charming debonair flair to it ,it seems he&#39;s become one of those playboy westernised-Asian hunky men...which is actually kinda hot and--<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! No!&quot; Nick welped, &quot;Phew that was close.&quot; Nick reassured himself, a dirty thought almost flooded to his brain. Reassuring himself as he picked up his phone and redailed Tanaka&#39;s number. Not even noticing his dick slowly but surely, rising to the occasion as japanese-office 60s music starts playing in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, you&#39;re really desperate in terms of calling me aren&#39;t ya?&quot; Tanaka Koreya responded, in his sultry, tangy-flavoured voice, which sends loverboy signals down straight to Nick&#39;s groin, as Nick absent-mindedly fondles with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey erm, listen. I&#39;m sorry for shouting at you earlier. I wasn&#39;t really...myself you see.&quot; Nick felt flustered, as though he&#39;s going for a job interview for the first time and the boss is his future Boyfriend. Only thing is, the tycoon he&#39;s speaking to is-was his Boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Nick looked at his surroundings , noticing a fresher, more work-friendly wall paper surrounding the walls as a mahogany door is set place the wooden the door frame that once stood. Several potted plants surrounded the office as numerous bookcases and shelves filled respectively with books and trophies are displayed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I just wanted to--&quot; Nick rested his right arm on the table, watching it grow longer and became more expensive as it turned into an Office desk. As a computer plopped to his side , with his right hand holding the mouse, clicking things, and Folders.<br />
<br />
His rested his left elbow on the desk TOP, noticing as chords spring down from the phone as  they connected with a telephone at the end, with the current phone he held in his hand morphing itself into a receiver. Definitely an older brand judging from the materials that they used to make this, yet it&#39;s still looking fresh and new-looking surprising enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm...&quot; Nick winced, his free hand massaging his enclosed groin below as blows out a sense of experience, as though it was his first time masturbaiting for a Long while, eyes focused on the folder labelled &quot;Love&quot;. His mind and growing groin intrigued by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? You sound rather anxious. Like your about to confess to someone your in love with them! Am I correct?&quot; Koreya cooed, with the ever so slight tingle of mockery being shown. <br />
<br />
Nick winced as his fingers rubbing in the new reality that&#39;s surging in, broken glass disappearing as a fresh new glass see-through panels of the city form their way, Nick loved being on a sky high office.<br />
<br />
He slumped back on his chair as it reshapes itself to a huge, bossy looking black office chair, with another less menacing looking chair directly in front of him for visitors. Clicking the folder to reveal a set of pictures of a beautiful woman on the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologise for scolding you earlier!&quot; Nick gave out a response so formally and quickly, whilst hastening the speed on his crotch. Feeling it being filled with newfound genes , which comes with an irresistible taste for the opposite sex, heterosexuality and all its benefits filling his balls as it travels through the rest of the body.<br />
<br />
&quot;HaHA! It&#39;s alright Aniki! You know how we men gotta release our manly hormones from time to time!&quot; Koreya laughed loudly. A sense of familiar bond relishes over the thoughts of sexual love. <br />
<br />
Nick glances over consistently back and forth at the computer and his body, he placed the receiver down and turned on the loud speaker. Watching as his hands travel to his toned legs and feet, feeling and observing them growing older as they lose their tanned definition and develop a yellowish hue and grow in terms of size, becoming bigger with a mixture of fats and muscle. Legs out longer as velvet red fabric sews down from his former board shorts, tightening against his waist as they form expensive dress pants, with white dress shoes similar to that those of his Brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes indeed...hormones.&quot; Nick responded, feeling his rock solid abs and pecs as a layer of fat bulks up surfer to boxer. Leaving traces of a man who participated in boxing a lot when he was younger and still trained occasionally from time to time. Arms elongating with his bigger sized body, being filled with muscle and fat as his skin tone became less tanned like his legs,  developing maturity and age as his plain shirt resizes itself to a large tight light blue dress shirt, buttoning up his bulky body. <br />
<br />
He straightened a nice looking tie that formed on his neck, as a silky vest neatly rests on his dress shirt, which gets layered by a matching red velvet suit jacket which hugs his hulky body. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got to release em somehow, I do all the banging. Too bad  you and your wife didn&#39;t do these kinds of things often.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pictures of the beautiful woman flooded his screensaver and mind. His new self and her overtaking the former surfers&#39; places in every picture and scenario Nick could think of as he blushed furiously, grasping his wedding ring.<br />
<br />
He blond hair gets pushed and combed into a neat professional side parting, retaining their blondness due to mixed blood existing in their family. Blue eyes remaining , yellowish skin completing the genetic code as the Tanaka blood runs in the family. His face ages and matures to a hefty 50 over, whilst retaining his handsome features over the years. <br />
<br />
Nikorasu came inside his boxers, and instantly adjusted his posture so as to reflect his authority and confidence reminding once again of his conservative , yet professional nature that he must set for his company. He is the head of Tanaka Transportations Inc, with his Brother Koreya being second in charge. Wouldn&#39;t want an outsider to do a job that a Tanaka is more capable of doing. Although it is indeed irritating that his Brother keeps on wasting money on gambling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways Aniki, I need to tell you something down by the docks where we always fished when we were younger. Gotta go right now. Stay straight!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Stay straight, heh.&quot; Sure he had eyes for a few beautiful women in his classes when he was younger , but he knew Carey was the only one for him the moment he saw her. He grasped his wedding ring, smiling as he thought about his Wife even after these many years.<br />
<br />
  Reassured and knowing that his lover would never leave him no matter what happens to either of them.</p>
