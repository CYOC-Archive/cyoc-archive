<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Without realizing it, your huge tail gently whips a stand of carrots followed by a light thuds of carrots falling to the ground as you and Daze look back to see what was falling. &quot;My carrots!&quot; the carrot guy said (totally not a reference to a certain show). You then turn to look at each other and then you say, &quot;I think let&#39;s go to your place, I want to learn how to dragon shift before we do something else.&quot; Daze replies, &quot;Good idea.&quot; you then leave the scene w/ the carrot guy picking up his fallen carrots while sobbing as some other people decide to help out. You wish you and Daze can help, but learning how to dragon shift comes first. You soon feel the guilt. &quot;I feel guilty about it.&quot;<br />
&quot;It happens friend. It happens.&quot; Daze says as you walk further away.<br />
<br />
A few blocks away from the tower&#39;s north, is a two story house w/ an entrance that is big as a cave as Daze jumps off of you and walks to the main gate. He then pushes the door w/ great effort as it swings open and holds it for you. &quot;After you!&quot; he says w/ a gentle smile you then go inside first as he closes the door and take a look at your surroundings. Walls filled w/ weapons plaque from swords to maces, books stacked on the side of his desk neatly and a clean surface of the desk w/ only just a medieval utensil to write and/or draw on an old paper. You then inspect the paper on the desk as Daze just hums away putting his trench coat on a mannequin and notices you looking at his work. Daze then walks up to you w/ his tail swishing behind him. &quot;Like what I&#39;m working on David?&quot; he asks as you turn to your left and see him beside you. You smile and nod, &quot;Yeah! It&#39;s awesome. I didn&#39;t know you draw.&quot; you reply as Daze then walks to his desk. On the paper shows a person wearing a strange armor and a white scarf around his neck. It shows what equipment and weapons he uses and different poses that was drawn in. Daze thought of letting you watch him drawing, but then he realizes something important, your dragon shifting. &quot;Oh! That reminds me why we came here. We need to let you learn the basics of dragon shifting!&quot; That also rings a bell why you came here, not for drawing, that can wait.<br />
<br />
Daze asks, &quot;Do you know how or when you turned into a dragon when you first showed up at the center of Castrumiel?&quot; You shake your head and reply, &quot;No, like I said, I was just following the stony path that leads to the center and I just started turning into a dragon immediately.&quot; He then thinks of how it happens and then tells him what he thinks how you turned into a dragon, &quot;Well, I have one or two possibilities of how you got turned into a dragon when you came in.&quot; He then raise his hand in front of you leveled to his head and sticks out pointer finger, &quot;One, your mind must be thinking of fitting into our world by subconsciously turning you into a dragon without you knowing it and caused a random trigger.&quot; He then pulls out the second finger forming a V, &quot;Two, you must be a part of a royal Draconian bloodline somewhere here, and your name, David is not really your real name.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is my real name, David!&quot; you say feeling you&#39;re offended. He then makes a hand gesture pushing the air realizing you&#39;re offended and backs up his claim, &quot;I am not saying it isn&#39;t, but it is a theory, or a possibility. I mean think for a second, when you walked to the path leading to Castrumiel, did you have a voice in your head calling out to you? Or you were just curious to where it leads?&quot;<br />
<br />
That is a good question, why did you go up that path? You didn&#39;t hear a voice in your head but it must have been calling your subconscious mind to go to Castrumiel. Then you feel like your mind is a blur, your memory is fuzzy. &quot;I feel light headed...&quot; You say to Daze. &quot;You might be remembering how to dragon shift or your mind is trying to remember something why you came here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You clutch your draconic head as waves of different thoughts of dragons, magic and what not of this world goes to your head and pass out. The last thing you saw and hear was Daze calling out to you before you pass out, &quot;David! David are you okay?!&quot; then, you imagine a fuzzy memory of a figure saying something as it echoes in your head, &quot;Get our son out of here! I&#39;ll hold them off!&quot; And that&#39;s where it ends. Suddenly, you feel like you remember how to dragon shift.<br />
<br />
You then wake up on the floor w/ a wet cloth on your forehead. And then you saw Daze w/ a green anthro dragon wearing some sort of messenger outfit but blurry since your vision is still trying to clear and hear him say something, &quot;... I need you to send this to Lord Castrumiel V to dispatch agents throughout the country of my friend&#39;s origin. But this must be kept secret and only you, me, and the Highness and his family knows about this, do you understand?&quot; the green dragon nods and Daze then adds another order, &quot;Tell my friend in the barracks, Kalren to come to my home along the way.&quot; You then lift your head up as your vision is still a bit blurry and call out to Daze weakly, &quot;D-Daze? Who is that?&quot; Daze looks at you waking up and walks to you as the green dragon leaves his house. &quot;That was my courier, Zael, you were muttering some words and I thought I heard a name that seemed familiar to me when you were talking in your sleep. Well, more like muttering.&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
You then try to get up but stumble a bit, your tail knocking a stack of books near the desk. Daze supports you from not falling over, &quot;Easy friend! You&#39;re still light headed from the shock you just got.&quot; You then manage to get back on all four and shake off the dizziness as your vision fully returns. &quot;How long was I out?&quot;<br />
&quot;Almost until evening.&quot;<br />
You were out for that long. Then you finally realize you learn how to dragon shift. &quot;Daze... I strangely think I know how to turn back to human and back...&quot; you say to him unsure if it is true.<br />
&quot;Well then, only one way to find out. Try to turn back to human.&quot; he says. You then take a deep breath and close your eyes and picture yourself as a human again. You and Daze then feel a magical force flow around you and feel your self changing. Your size is shrinking back to human size, wings are retracting to your back, your muzzle retreats to your face as your mane becomes regular human short orange spiky hair, and you start to have five fingers and toes tipped w/ claws and your red and yellow scales soon disappear, while some scar on your arms, legs, hands, feet, torso and face. The changes ends as the muzzle soon becomes a human face and your teeth becomes somewhat human-like as you slowly open your eyes.<br />
<br />
You then look at Daze w/ a gentle smile on his face. &quot;What?&quot; you say as he points to your body. You look down and notice you&#39;re human again. But w/ some draconic features and some red and yellow scales exposed on certain locations on your body. &quot;I&#39;m human again...&quot; you say to him.<br />
&quot;Good job on remembering how to shape shift, and... Nice dick.&quot; he said w/ a chuckle as you look down what he meant. You then blush and cover it up. &quot;Got any clothes I can borrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
After putting on the borrowed clothes from Daze, you then ask Daze what he was doing. &quot;When you passed out, I went out to find someone to get my courier to send a letter to Lord Castrumiel V about your situation.&quot; he then continues as he gives you a waterskin to drink from as you thanked him for it. &quot;Mostly, you were moaning and groaning in fear of something, like a monster is underneath your bed. But then you slurred out, &#39;mother&#39; and &#39;father&#39; and then, &#39;brother.&#39;&quot; You try to recall those thoughts of memories, but they just vanished, all except for one. That mysterious figure that either saved you, or something else. &quot;I don&#39;t remember those when I passed out, but along when I do strangely remember how to turn into a dragon and back, there was a mysterious figure in front of me...&quot; Daze&#39;s eyes popped for a second. &quot;&#39;Mysterious figure?&#39;&quot; he repeats what you said. You nod, &quot;I don&#39;t know the details of how he or she looks, but I think that person saved me from a burning building...&quot; Daze then ponders what you said, &lt;Mysterious figure... burning building... something that scares this young man... Could it be? No, it couldn&#39;t have been Jeht to save him...&gt;<br />
<br />
You and Daze hear the door knock. Daze then opens up the door, it was Daze&#39;s friend, Kalren.<br />
&quot;Hello, Daze. You seem troubled.&quot; he greets to him.<br />
<br />
Once meeting Kalren, as he sits down in front of you and beside Daze, he then ask a question...</p>
