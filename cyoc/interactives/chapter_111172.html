<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Jeff went down for dinner, he noticed a certain option on the Chronivac on his computer (which was the only part of the room that remained unchanged).  Apparently he can lock the Chronivac from outside use with a password so that no one can make alterations to the changes he made.<br />
<br />
&quot;I probably should lock this then, I won&#39;t make changes on Mom or Megan without their permission but I cannot have the possibility of them making unwanted changes to me.&quot; Jeff thought aloud.  So after coming up with a password and locking the Chronivac, Jeff went downstairs to eat dinner.<br />
<br />
When Jeff came down, his Mom and Megan, his formally younger now temporarily older sister at 12 yrs old, were at the table waiting for him.  When they saw him, their reactions differed, his Mom knew he was going to be younger so she was only slightly surprised but Megan was another story.  Seeing her older brother now only half his original age was a bit of a shock for her so she mostly just sat there with her jaw open.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how young are you right now?&quot; Their mom asked.  &quot;8 years old, I wanted to be younger but not too young.&quot; Jeff replied, which caused Megan to get out of her shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, so this is what you meant when Jeff would be different when he came down.&quot; Megan said.  Just hearing a prepubescent and childish voice coming from upstairs rather than her older brother&#39;s normally deep voice was surprising to her, but to see her older brother now actually younger than her gave her quite the shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how is it like to be younger?&quot; Their Mom asked.  &quot;A little weird, everything seems so big now compared to before.&quot; Jeff said looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I&#39;m the older sister now?&quot; Megan asked excitedly.  &quot;Only for the weekend.&quot; Jeff replied, a little fearful of what his sister could do to him now that he was younger than her.  Jeff saw Megan as a rather nice girl, a bit of a tomboy, but a nice and rather energetic girl regardless.  But seeing that Megan was now a full head taller than his current height made him a little nervous of what his sister could do to him.  Jeff was now glad that he locked the Chronivac earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now kids, it is time to eat.&quot; Mom interrupted.  &quot;Yes Mom.&quot; Both Jeff and Megan replied.  So both Jeff and Megan sat down to eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Mom, what are we having?&quot;  Jeff asked.  &quot;Shake&#39;N Bake Chicken,&quot; oh good, something he liked, &quot;with corn and green beans.&quot; His mom finished.  &quot;Oh and Jeff, make sure you eat your vegetables.&quot;  His mom added playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Jeff began with a dry look, &quot;just because I look like a kid doesn&#39;t mean I have to act like one.&quot; He finished.  &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think you had much problems with me in that issue.&quot;  Jeff added.  &quot;Well you have me there.&quot; His Mom said.  After that we started eating.  I found that due to my now smaller body, I could not eat as much as I could normally.  At 16 I could normally eat 8 shaken&#39; bake chicken wings with little trouble, now at half my age I was starting to get full with just 4.  I also found at my reduced age that my sense of taste was enhanced compared to before, because of this the chicken was just delicious and the vegetables, while still palatable, tasted different as well.  Now I could understand why kids of my now current age seem to avoid vegetables, I for one soldiered on through them anyway with no complaint.<br />
<br />
After dinner was done, I went up to my room to play with my legos some more.  After a few minutes, Megan opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff.&quot; She greeted.  &quot;Hey Megan,&quot; I began, &quot;What are you doing in my room?&quot;  I asked warily.  &quot;What, my rather cool older brother has now become my cute younger brother.  There is no way I can pass up looking into this more.&quot;  She retorted.  Megan then took the time to look around my room.  I stood up took a moment to see how tall she was compared to me now.  At about 5ft, she towers over me by a full head, having to look up at her with my current height of around 4ft 3in felt rather weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she began, &quot;your room and your clothes now reflect your current age?&quot;  She inquired.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; I replied.  &quot;If I am going to be younger then I might as well have clothes that fit and a room that matches.&quot;  &quot;Well, she began, &quot;What kind of change did you make to yourself? She asked.  &quot;Well except for you and mom, everyone else will think I really am 8 years old, mentally I am still 16, mostly.&quot;  I finished.  Megan then looked at my computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you used this program on your to make you younger?&quot; She asked.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; I replied.  &quot;It&#39;s called the Chronivac.&quot;  Megan then went over to my computer, looked at the options and clicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey it&#39;s locked.&quot; She said.  &quot;Of course,&quot; I replied, &quot;While I will not be making changes to you or Mom without your permission, I don&#39;t want unwanted changes made to me either.&quot; I retorted.  &quot;Well okay you have a point.&quot;  Megan replied, &quot;A program you can use to make changes to your life like this would be rather tempting.&quot;  She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you want to play?&quot;  She asked.  &quot;Where are you going with this?&quot; I asked warily.  &quot;What?  I am now an older sister to a cute younger bother, why would I not want to play with you?&quot;  She retorted.  &quot;What were you going to do before I came in?&quot;  Megan then asked.  &quot;Well,&quot; I began, somewhat embarrassed, I was going to play with legos to see how it is.&quot; I replied.  Well then, I will play with legos with you.&quot;  She said.  &quot;Okay,&quot; I sighed, &quot;whatever you say.&quot;<br />
<br />
After that I reluctantly let her play with me.  After several minutes of being wary of my younger now older sister, my fears melted away.  Megan did not take advantage of me at all when I was younger and played with me fairly.  After a while I actually started to enjoy playing with my sister.  Maybe being this young was not going to be so bad.  &#39;Well, I could always make changes later.&#39;  I thought.  After a while of playing, we heard a knock on my door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, Megan,&quot;  She called, &quot;Can I come in?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Yeah, you can come in.&quot; I replied.  Mom came in and after seeing us asked, &quot;Oh Megan, were you playing with Jeff?&quot;  She asked playfully.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; Megan replied, &quot; I was playing with legos with Jeff, being the older sister is fun.&quot;  She finished.  &quot;Oh, you were having fun Jeff?&quot; Mom asked me playfully.  &quot;Erm yeah.&quot;  I replied somewhat embarrassed.  &quot;Well then it is now 8:30pm, It is about time for you young man, to start getting ready for bed.&quot; She said.  &quot;Mom,&quot; I began, &quot;But I am not tired yet.&quot;  After saying that I yawned.  &quot;Well that yawn says otherwise.&quot;  She retorted.  &quot;Young boys at your now current age have a lot of energy, but they will be burned out at the end of the day.&quot;  You will need plenty of rest to stay healthy.&quot; She retorted.  Mom did have a point there, luckily or unluckily being mentally 16 means I understood what she meant.  I may be mentally 16 but my body is 8.  Besides, I did this to myself, I cannot really complain about it.  &quot;Okay.&quot;  I replied resignedly.  &quot;I expect you be be in bed by around 9.&quot;  Mom said.  &quot;Fine.&quot; I said without complaint.<br />
<br />
After washing up in the shower, which luckily I was allowed to do by myself, and brushing my teeth and other things, which unfortunately required me to use a stool just to see and reach, I was walking to my room in my now child sized pajamas.  Before I got there, my sister was waiting for me, already in her pajamas, luckily for both of us we have our own bathrooms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan,&quot; I began, &quot;Why are you here?&quot;  Megan then surprised me by pulling me into a hug.  I could not say I did not like it, it felt rather warm.  &quot;Thank you for the time.&quot; She finally said.  she then let go and walked away to her own room.  I just stood there for a few minutes, surprised at what my sister did.  &quot;Maybe I should become this young more often.&quot; I mused aloud.  &quot;Maybe you should,&quot; I heard from behind me, &quot;She looked rather happy and satisfied.&quot;  My Mom finished.  I turned around to see mom.  &quot;Oh hey Mom, I was just about to go in.&quot;  I said.  &quot;I know,&quot; Mom, began, I was just making sure you really are going to bed.&quot;  She said.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; I began with a yawn, i did not realize I was this tired.  &quot;I probably should be tucking in.&quot;  I finished.  <br />
<br />
I then walked in to my room with my mom following, when I got to my bed, Mom then hugged me and gave me a kiss on the cheek.  &quot;Mom?&quot; I asked, rather embarrassed by her actions.  &quot; Sorry Jeff, you being this young again, I couldn&#39;t resist.&quot; She admitted.  &quot;Well, goodnight Jeff.&quot;  She said.  &quot;Goodnight.&quot;  I replied, having no retort.  Mom then turnoff the light and left the room.  I must have been really tired, because I was out like a like just a few minutes after my head hit the pillow.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s Mom was outside her son&#39;s door.  It really warmed her heart a bit seeing her son and daughter enjoying themselves together earlier, especially after they have become somewhat distant lately.  She could only surmise that her son becoming younger had brought the two together a little closer.  She then went to her room to eventually get to sleep herself.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Saturday at around 8am, Jeff woke up.  He looked around his room wondering why it looked like it belonged to a little kid, but he then remembered that he made himself younger yesterday evening.  He got up, washed up in the bathroom, then changed into his child sized clothes.  Normally Mom cooked a big breakfast on Saturdays so he did not have to go down yet.  he then decided to get on to his computer and look at the Chronivac again.  He surprisingly had a lot of fun being younger.  After looking at the options, he wondered that rather than just be young for the weekend, which the Chronivac is set to grow him back up this Sunday evening, why not stay young all the way till next Sunday?  Or even stay 8 yeas old permanently and start and grow back up and start over from there.  Should he choose now or wait and see how today is going to be like.  Which should he choose?</p>
