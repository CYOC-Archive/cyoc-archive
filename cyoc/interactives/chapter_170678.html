<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what should we do first? Find the inn, sell our loot, or check in with the guild?&quot; asked Vivian. &quot;Hmm, well me and Alice need to be together if we are going to the market, but actually she is kinda needed everywhere but the market. So why not just go to the guild first, then me and her will go to the inn, and you go sell our loot&quot; suggested Andrea. &quot;I agree&quot; added Alice &quot;plus then we can select our gear we need for any new quests we take. I also need new clothes. Not that your hand made ones are bad, but they dont really fit me the best either, and they are kind of falling apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
With their plan decided upon, the 3 girls and Neka would goto the Adventurer&#39;s Guild main building first. Along the way Neka had gotten tired and was now sleeping on top of Alice&#39;s boobs. This brought about some extra stares, however Alice didn&#39;t mind, and just ignored them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Alice, why DID you blow the guy back there?&quot; Asked Vivian, sounding somewhat annoyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;To simply send a message not to bother me, or you guys with those kind of requests in the future. That guard likely won&#39;t ever get another satisfying orgasm for the next several years after today, because nothing he would experience would come close to feeling as good as a Succubus&#39;s Drain&#39;s orgasm. If it is timed correctly, so that when they would cum anyways, it tricks their body and mind into expecting all future orgasms to be on par with it, which is impossible unless a Succubus does it. Which is why I name dropped you Andrea. Those guys wouldn&#39;t dare go even think to go after us if their highest ranking officer is a direct relative of their targets party member. And they knew your name from your own ID card, so that alone wasn&#39;t enough to make it clear not to mess with us. So I added to the warning, by making an example. However, I now realize that my actions likely have upset you, so I apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so that was why. I see. Thank you, I guess? Just please don&#39;t do it again without asking me first, okay? I am your girlfriend afterall.&quot; Vivian seemed to be relieved a bit. &quot;Still though, I kinda feel bad for his wife now.&quot; Chuckled Andrea. &quot;He is either single and/or a virgin, I didn&#39;t taste any one else on his dick.&quot;<br />
&quot;S&#39;that so? Well I guess that is a bit better. But we shoukd try to not get into anymore trouble with the Alabaster guards okay. Using my sister&#39;s name can only go so far for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
After another 15 minutes of walking, they finally reached their destination. The large main building of the Alabaster Adventurer&#39;s Guild. &quot;I think I will get us a simple quest, while you 2 go and explaing what happened&quot; instructs Andrea. &quot;Alright, but nothing too dangerous like mine excavations or dungeon clearing. I dont really want to dive underground at the moment, now that I can finally fly&quot; asked Alice. Andrea gave her a somewhat confused look. &quot;What do you mean? Those kind of quests usually are D rank at lowest. At best with you, the highest we are taking is E, although if they update your rank, then maybe we do a D ranked quest afterwards. But you are still way too green for higher ranked quests. Besides, I have the perfect quest already in mind, harpy subjugation. Since you can fly and now that we have Neka, these kind of quests should be a cake walk.&quot; <br />
&quot;I have actually done one of those quest before! If it harpies, then I think it will be a good one for me to practice on too.&quot; Alice excitedly agreed. &quot;If it is harpies, then maybe I can learn things like aerial combat too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you two, we are burning daylight&quot; Vivian said while she pulled Alice away towards the register. When it was finally their turn, the receptionist greeted them politely. &quot;Welcome, my name is Felicia, how may I assist you ladies. Oh, would you happen to be the succubus Alice? We recieved a notice that a succubus named Alice would be stopping by from one of our field HQs in the west, and were instructed to give you this box if you could prove you are her&quot; says Felicia. Alice lookes over a Vivian confused, but she also had no idea. &quot;May as well see what it is&quot; was all she could suggest. Turning back towards the receptionist, Alice presents her her card &quot;I am indeed Alice, and yes i am a succubus, so it ia likely me, they sent that for since I was just there earlier too.&quot; <br />
Felicia takes Alice&#39;s card and checks its authenticity, confirming it is real. Once she was satisfied, she handed over the box and returned the card to Alice, who took stepped aside in order to let Vivian handle things for now. <br />
<br />
While Vivian was explaining the events that had haolened with the Witch, Alice curiously opened the box. Inside it was a note, and a pair of dangling earrings, each with a small pink crystal imbedded into them. Confused, Alice began to read the hand written note:<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice,<br />
I forgot to hand these as well to you earlier. As a succubus, I am sure you will soon be no stranger to sex. However you must remember that even as a succubus, not all sex is done with both party&#39;s interests in mind. I am sure there will be times when you must use sex in order to accomplish something or protect yourself or those you care about. Especially now that you are a succubus, you may find those who believe Succubi are simply a race of sex craized whores, put in this world for the sole purpose if pleasing men. THAT ISN&#39;T TRUE. But idiots can&#39;t be always be taught new things. <br />
<br />
So I am giving you these earrings to help protect yourself. While equiped, they will neutralize any STDs you may come in contact with, as well as prevent pregnancies. However, if you are already pregnant, then it will not imterfeer with it, and simply prevent STDs. They also have a magic lock. Once equipt, they are impossible to remove unless 1 of 2 things happen. Your ears are removed, or you pass into them the &quot;mana key&quot; which is automatically is set to your mana signature. Just hold each earring and pass mana into them to unlock them. <br />
<br />
I hope these never need to get used, but better safe than sorry right?<br />
<br />
~Cecelia&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. I didn&#39;t even think of that when I blew that guard&quot; thought Alice, quickly putting on the earrings. She only winced in pain twice when each of the pins passed through her ear lobes though. She put the note away but was startled when the box vaporized in her hand. Noticing Alice&#39;s fright, Felicia explains quickly that it was a special box that commonly is used in one way deliveries. Once opened, it will vaporize after 1 minute passes. It is a security feature to show if something was tampered with, since only the sender and the intended reciever should be able to open the box. If it was forced open, then the item wouldn&#39;t be able to be delivered. While you would lose the item to whoever intercepted the package, you wouldn&#39;t fall into their trap as well. It was invented to prevent nobles from being poisoning through the mail system, and later was implemented for priority mail deliveries or any delivery containing equipment.<br />
<br />
It didnt take much longer, and after Vivian and Alice resubmitted their cards to be credited with the Witch Subjugation, and accepted their rewards, they went to meet back up with Andrea. Andrea already had selected 2 Harpy quests that were in areas similar to each other in walking direction, but the closest was around a 4 day walk from Alabaster, while the further was an additional 6 from the first location. The good news was that since Alice could fly, their travel time would be cut significantly since crossing the rocky terrain near the first location could be bypassed. &quot;So what, am I our party&#39;s official pony now?&quot; joked Alice. This was answered by Vivian gently carressing Alice&#39;s cheek while saying&quot; and you make for a very cute pony to boot, should I pick out a bridal for you when I go shopping for our equipment later? Do you prefer a wooden, steel, or leather bit?&quot; then Vivian leaned over to whisper into Alice&#39;s ear &quot;or are you more of a ball gag fan?&quot; If Alice&#39;s face wasn&#39;t concealed by the veil, everyone would see it was now red, and that she was obviously getting horny. &quot;Shut up, I am not your pony, but I will still fly you guys&quot; then she leaned over to Vivian &quot;and if I had to pick, please get me a strapless ring gag which can be hidden from view inside my mouth, and I will try and aquire some real horse parts sometime, that is if you really are into ponygirls&quot; Alice whispered back. <br />
<br />
They finished up their discussion about preperations, along with Alice requesting Vivian to see if someone could make her some kind of lightweight carrying device other than a sleeping bag to carry them both with when she was flying. Then they went their seperate ways, Vivian to the market district, and Andrea and Alice to look for the Inn, where Vivian would meet back up with them at later that evening.</p>
