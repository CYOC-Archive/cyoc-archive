<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the last week of the long summer of fun, and Jeff and his two pals had free reign of their cabin up in the woods for a couple of days. Jeff brought the chronivac with him to try it out one last time before the new school year. <br />
<br />
He switched on the settings, not realizing just how deep of a situation he was getting himself into. He didn&#39;t realize just how specific he needed to be with this new programming for the settings he created. <br />
<br />
He set the changes to occur the next day, as soon as he stepped outside. Meanwhile, he would hang out with the twins all night. And all night long, they kept cracking jokes at his expense, and periodically at eachother. <br />
<br />
At the end of the night, just before bed, he looked at the watch. 26 hours! <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! I&#39;ll be stuck as a donkey for longer than a day!&quot; <br />
<br />
He started to get nervous and worried. He was tossing and turning in bed all night. Imagining being stuck as a fat smelly donkey for 26 hours. He even jerked off silently to the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least it won&#39;t be permanent....&quot; He thought as he drifted off to sleep....<br />
<br />
&quot;Beeee boooo beee boooo!&quot; The alarm on his watch was going off. Groggily, he stretches in bed. And peeked open an eye.... Sunlight! Shit.....SHIT! <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to turn into a DONKEY!&quot; he thought as he quickly got up. He was about to jerk himself off, but...Nah! He thought he would save himself for when he was on all fours and struggle to jerk off without hands! The idea of such sexual tension and frustration with such physical limitations as being stuck with the body of a donkey always him. <br />
<br />
Jeff KNEW he definitely didn&#39;t want to be STUCK as a donkey for real on one hand; it would be boring most of the time and worse; knowing he could no longer do anything that he loved; video games, going to the shore, collecting cards - the collecting cards as a donkey would be funny if not serious. He could just imagine himself wanting to pick up a new pack, open it and see what he got. Just to be totally unable to do such a thing. Not without completely destroying them in his huge chompers as the only way to have any chance of opening them. That is. IF he could ever get his hands.....eeeeeerrr hoo- no. Not hooves! That is to  say, if he could even get his TEETH on a pack. His HUMUNGOUS disgusting yellow and slimy donkey&#39;s teeth. Donkeys are large animals confined to the outdoors and maybe stables. <br />
<br />
There are miniature donkeys, of course. But even minis are far too large and heavy to just sling them around by their ears that Disney made so many donkey Tf writers believe is a thing. No. Jeff got off on imagining becoming the REAL thing! A genuine full-bred, grey-furred, African-styled ass.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, he also wished he knew he WOULD be stuck as a donkey. Knowing he got himself into a really downright terrible situation he&#39;d be stuck having to live with. That idea would leave him feeling shaken and mortified. <br />
<br />
He came back to reality with a ridiculously stiff boner and  looked at his watch. Fuck! FUCK! It was up to 38 hours now! The twins were up and already exchanging barbs at his expense! The longer he waited, the more jabs the twins would poke at his way. The longer his &quot;sentence&quot; to all fours would be! Jeff had decided he didn&#39;t like the idea of being stuck to all-fours for long-term. The due was already cast, and there was no nothing he could possibly do about. That machine was going to turn him into a donkey once he stepped foot outside. The longer he waited, the longer he would remain a donkey. It was already going to be longer than a full day! <br />
<br />
A full day! Fuck!<br />
<br />
Jeff rose, threw on his skivvies and ran downstairs towards the back porch as he looked at the watch. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Hey Vin!&quot; said Ant. Both twins were outside on the porch. Jeff heard them through the screen door as he was making his way through the cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at your GIRLFRIEND,&quot; he said as he showed Vin a photo of one of the so-called &quot;Cellblock Sisters.&quot; Long story short, the &quot;Cell Block&quot; sisters was a nickname of these two ugly chicks that frequented a local night club called &quot;The Cellblock.&quot; It was inside of an old 250 year old jail. The girls in question, one fat and other way too thin, were....well.... Let&#39;s just say they were none-too-pleasant to look at, and were completely oblivious to their social standing.<br />
<br />
The watched ticked up to 39 hours!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! That wasn&#39;t right! They weren&#39;t talking about me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, man, you know you like them tiny titties,&quot; said Vin to Ant. <br />
<br />
40 hours! <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! I&#39;ve got to stop them!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Vin! Ant&quot; Jeff called through the screen door as he opened it and stepped through into the full bright sunlight, completely forgetting the parameters he had set about that.<br />
<br />
The world spun as Jeff flew forward, landing HEAVILY upon his.....FRONT HOOVES! <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaawwww heeeee hhhaaawww!&quot; He tried to finished. Unable to speak as his body ballooned up to an obnoxious, dense, heavy weight. The air around him suddenly feeling warmer. MUCH warmer. He was covered head to....tail! With a thick heavy hide and gray fur coat that he couldn&#39;t remove! The familiar feeling of being stuck with the body of a donkey returning, grossing him out almost instantly! <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; Declared the twins at the same time. The sudden appearance and crashing of a large imposing  creature out of nowhere and from inside the cabin startling the two boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah....FUCK! Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea after all...&quot; Jeff thought as he swung his thick, heavy skull around to view the body he would be stuck with for the next two days! Or....so he thought! <br />
<br />
&quot;The hell is a DONKEY doing coming out of the HOUSE!?&quot; Asked one of the twins incredulously. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea! Wasn&#39;t Jeff just standing there calling us...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! He was! Maybe that IS him? I always knew he was an ASS!&quot; declared one of the twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;40 hours!&quot; The watch declared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.....what!?&quot; Jeff thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff!&quot; One of the twins called towards the house as he clopped rapidly  off the porch into brighter sunlight so as to try to have a better view of the watch stuck to his right leg.<br />
<br />
 &quot;You have a BOYFRIEND looking for you!&quot; called one of the twins into the cabin thinking Jeff had run back inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;41 hours.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaawww!&quot; Jeff declared. &quot;(No!) &quot; <br />
&quot;Heeeeee hhhaaawww hhhaaawww!&quot; &quot;(That&#39;s not right!)&quot; He tried saying. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe one of the Cell Block sisters lost her lover!&quot; Said the other twin as he unknowingly approached his friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;42 hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;(42!?)&quot; Jeff thought with growing alarm and concern. &quot;(That....that&#39;s not right!)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell is this?&quot; Asked the closest twin to Jeff the donkey. Poor Jeff could no longer pick out each twin&#39;s identifying features to tell them apart by looking at them! He....he had to go by....SMELL! And they smelled far too similar, and had no frame of reference to know which smelled like which. <br />
<br />
&quot;Error.....Error...Reseting parameters....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaaaaaaaaaaaw!?&quot; Jeff let out a long-wimded bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Check it out! This random ass donkey is wearing a watch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Neat!&quot; The other twin approached closer.<br />
<br />
The watch transmitting information directly into Jeff&#39;s sensitive ears that only he could hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;New settings....<br />
&quot;Subject: Jeff...<br />
&quot;Donkey duration: 48 hours....<br />
&quot;New settings....<br />
&quot;Controling Subjects: Salavatore twins...<br />
&quot;New settings....<br />
&quot;Duration Set: 1 hour....<br />
&quot;Parameters: Every word spoken by Control Subjects....<br />
&quot;Subject in control: While Subject wears pairing device.&quot;<br />
&quot;Execute!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeee hhhaaawww...&quot; &quot;(What the fuck does THAT mean!?.)&quot;<br />
<br />
Whatever it meant, it didn&#39;t sound good! <br />
<br />
&quot;Where the hell did this animal come from anyway, and why the hell is it wearing a watch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Words spoken by Control Subjects 1: 18...<br />
&quot;New donkey duration set: 66 hours&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAAWWWWW! Heeeee HAAAAWWW!&quot; (NOOOOO! Ohhhh GOD!) <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart rate began to rise! This wasn&#39;t right!<br />
<br />
 &quot;I can&#39;t be stuck as a donkey for 66 hours!&quot; <br />
<br />
He could barely stand it a day his first try! It was only enjoyable when he masturbated, but every minute beyond that SUCKED!<br />
<br />
The twins jumped back in surprise at Jeff&#39;s sudden outburst. After all, he was a large animal that weighed more than both of them combined and double that! <br />
<br />
&quot;This HAD to be Jeff&#39;s doing!&quot;<br />
&quot;For sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Word count from Control Subjects: 8...<br />
New duration; 74 hours...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;(Seventy f- .... Seventy four hours!? THREE DAYS!?)&quot; <br />
<br />
Terror gripped poor Jeff&#39;s heart as he came to fully understand what was happening. His eyes getting big, as he began to look around wildly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaawww heeeee hhhaaawww-&quot; his voice catching in his large throat as he was about to cry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; the twins continued to converse as the timer jumped up by another ten hours of donkey-time for Jeff to 84 hours. <br />
<br />
He sucked in his breath for a moment as he looked at the twins in terror. <br />
<br />
&quot;They have to stop! They....have to stop TALKING!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAWWWWWW heeee, hhhaaawww!&quot; &quot;(Stop talking, guys!)&quot; He tried to say! <br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;So....what do we do now?&quot; one of them asked again useless. Wasting more words, increasing Jeff&#39;s donkeyhood by another 6 hours! <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know....call animal control or something? <br />
<br />
Yet another 8 words. 14 more hours! Up to NINETY EIGHT HOURS of being stuck as a donkey, all with just a few minutes of conversation between the twins!<br />
<br />
&quot;(Animal control!?)&quot; Jeff thought wildly!<br />
&quot;HAAAAWWW! Heeeee HAAAAWWW! Heeeee....&quot;(GUYS! It&#39;s ME! Jeff...!)&quot;<br />
<br />
Another gut-wrenching realization hit Jeff.... He couldn&#39;t speak! Nothing! Not a single god damned word would be allowed to leave his big fat black donkey lips! That&#39;s when the REAL panic set in as the full realization of his situation slammed into his mind! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaaawww heeee hhhaawww heeee hhhaaawww!&quot; Jeff began to &quot;scream,&quot; unable to form any part of any word. Not even the simplest of human sounds he could make! As far as anyone else was concerned, he was just a full-blown regular old donkey! Communication wouldn&#39;t be possible! Not a single thought in his mind could be expressed! <br />
<br />
&quot;(Oh god....OH! GOD!...I don&#39;t want to be a donkey! The watch!)&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff glanced down at the watch stuck on his right front leg.<br />
<br />
(&quot;Of course! The watch! I&#39;ve gotta take this watch off!)&quot;<br />
<br />
But. He couldn&#39;t! He had no hands! Nor could he speak to the twins to ask for help! <br />
<br />
The boys, now scared by the large panicking animal in front of them just off the porch in a patch of tree-shaded brown lawn in front of the cabin, backed off. Still communicating with each other and the timer still counting up by the hours. 190 hours now!<br />
<br />
&quot;(I am! I&#39;m....I&#39;m STUCK! I&#39;m STUCK! As a...a....DONKEYYY!!) his mind screamed as he instinctivrly tried using his left hand that no longer existed to remove the watch from his right foreleg. <br />
<br />
&quot;(HOOVES!!)&quot; He thought &quot;loudly&quot; in a panic as yet another reality set in.<br />
<br />
(I....i....can&#39;t. I can&#39;t Get. This. WATCH. OFF!!!)&quot; <br />
&quot;Heeeee hhhaaawww heeee hhaaaww heeeee HAAAAAAAWWWWW!!!<br />
<br />
Tears streaming from his eyes as he began to buck. Trying to escape his own body. Trying to shed his own fur and thick hide to no avail! Braying over and over in the futile attempt to communicate with the twins for help, but completely unable to do so!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the twins, still puzzled as to what some random farm beast was doing at the cabin in the woods, were still talking to each other. Building Jeff&#39;s sentence to a life on all fours for a longer and longer time period. <br />
<br />
The twins began to talk about calling animal control again, which Jeff overheard in a quieter moment of non-panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhhaaaww heeee hhhhaaaww heeee hhhaaawww!?&quot; (Animal control!?)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;(Please! No! Not that!)&quot;<br />
<br />
The watch blurted out 597 hours! <br />
<br />
&quot;(500....97....HOURS!?)&quot; Jeff thought. (&quot;It&#39;s up to 597 hours!? How....how long is THAT!?)&quot; <br />
<br />
597 divided by 24.... &quot;(Dammit! I need a calculator! And.... FUUCK! I can&#39;t even USE one!)&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t too good at doing math in his head, but he could count by 25s. He just....had no fingers to keep track of the days for each 25 he counted for a rough estimate of the number of DAYS he would be stuck! <br />
<br />
&quot;(597 hours!)&quot; He thought again dejectedly as he looked back at his own body. He saw his own thick and heavy male equipment under there. Huge black balls hanging low. A gigantic dick he could never touch began to grow. <br />
<br />
The twins had gone inside by this point. Shut and looked the door. Their chatty conversation continuing. <br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Word count from Control Subjects: 734...<br />
New duration; 782 hours...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;(Seve-seven.....HUNDRED....EIGHTY....TWO!?)&quot;  Jeff thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;( Oh....oh GOD! I&#39;ve....I&#39;ve GOT to take this damned thing OFF!)&quot; <br />
<br />
There was absolutely NO chance of getting Ant and Vin to never say another word for the next 782 hours! But the watch DID mention something about adding more time to his donkeyhood as long as he was wearing the damn thing....didn&#39;t it? <br />
<br />
&quot;(Didn&#39;t it!?)&quot; He thought. &quot;(What did it say about that!? Oh...oh shit! I can&#39;t remember! The chronivac! I need the....)&quot; He looked down at his solid hooves and huge animalistic form. Absolutely no chance he would be using the chronivac! Not any time soon! <br />
<br />
&quot;(FUUUUUUCK! I can&#39;t USE the fucking chronivac! I&#39;m a... I&#39;m a....)&quot; he hesitated in his mind. &quot;(I&#39;m just a.... A..... DONKEY!)&quot; <br />
<br />
The word &quot;donkey&quot; finally settled into his mind with horror as more tears began to slowly leak out of his big brown eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaaaww-&quot; he began to speak, but stopped at the sound of those disgusting honking brays.<br />
<br />
&quot;(That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to able to do for the next 973 hours. Is just bray. Just. Stand around on all fours, and just....BRAY!) <br />
<br />
Bashing and rubbing his right leg on a tree in the attempt to dislodge the infernal watch was useless. The timer kept going up. And up. And up! And Jeff had no way of knowing or figuring out how many days, or weeks, or....MONTHS....his time had built up. <br />
<br />
1072 hours! <br />
<br />
A pickup with a big horse trailer was approaching from a distance. Jeff&#39;s sharp hearing through the enormous satellite-like ears protruding from the top of his thick, long skull picked up the noise. He just heard the engine and a bunch of rattling. He felt his ears stand straight up at attention and automatically swivel around upon his head. A feeling of humiliation sweeping over him. Big tall fat donkey ears sticking straight up and swivelling around! <br />
<br />
Jeff thought of those weird kids at school that come in wearing hats with animal ears. He and the twins used to talk about them in a derisive manner. Now he, Jeff, was going to be stuck with ACTUAL ears of an animal on the very top of his long, thick skull, and for God knows how long! <br />
<br />
&quot;Word count from Control Subjects: 1127..<br />
New duration; 1175 hours...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff began to hyperventilate. Heeeing and haaawwing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey! I&#39;m....STUCK as a DONKEY! Looking back and down at the bloated body of a farm animal that he now possessed. He started getting horny. His huge black dick coming out of its surprisingly soft leathery black sheath. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhhaaaww!&quot; He brayed, just to confirm he truly could not speak. He knew he didn&#39;t have hands, and therefore, wouldn&#39;t be able to grab that huge hunk of fat, dark, and hot male animal meat that was now his. His fat bloated skull, huge ugly and disgusting blocky donkey teeth and tongue, and huge ears on the top of his skull, all collaborated towards his sexual deviancy over his donkeyhood. <br />
<br />
The timer of his watch continually climbed as the twins continued a conversation between themselves inside that house. Jeff being denied the ability to figure out the math without having hands for the next 1289 hours added more to his growing frustrations, which fueled his still-growing erection!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god! Oh GOD! I need to get off!&quot; He thought. &quot;But....how-?&quot; At the instance of asking the question to himself, he he had no choice. It was worse than needing to pee and unable to do so! He dropped down to his knees, went down onto his rear haunches, and stretched his front legs in front of him. He began to hump the ground. Trying to reach out with hands and fingers he knew he couldn&#39;t have for the next 1300 hours now! His gigantic donkey cock began to pump. His balls tingling like mad as he was getting ever closer to climax.....<br />
<br />
Then a big pickup truck with a large horse trailer came pulling up near him! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee hhhhaaaww!&quot; Jeff brayed in irritation and a sudden spark of humiliation. He realized the twins were watching him from the window while two guys got out of that truck as he was openly and publically MASTURBATING! As a....FUCKING DONKEY!</p>
