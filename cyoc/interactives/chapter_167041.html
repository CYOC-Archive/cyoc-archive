<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Herbert nudged her arm with his wet nose. &quot;Oh silly me. Dogs can&#39;t use Chronivac.&quot; She walked back and pulled up a keyboard as Herbert rolled his eyes. &quot;If only you had fingers. That could be arranged later if you want to try. For now, lets decide together what to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Herbert gestured with his head towards her and back to him as she picked up on the signs. &quot;Me into a dog. Got it.&quot; she opened her profile and picked different settings as Herbert barked to show his consent or nudging her to change things slightly, he decided on the majority of settings.<br />
<br />
Name: Elizabeth<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Species: Dog<br />
Libido: Insatiable<br />
Breed: Husky<br />
Frame: Small<br />
Pregnancy: 70% complete, random litter between 2-10 puppies<br />
Breast: Constant lactation<br />
Age: 3 years<br />
Reality Change: Instant<br />
Global change: Dogs are a dominant species<br />
Awareness: Unaware<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Herbert, you&#39;re even kinkier than I though. That is a lot of very specific fetishes you&#39;ve got there&quot; She grinned at him knowing if he didn&#39;t have fur she&#39;d get to see him blush. &quot;If you get to make so many changes, how about I add some of these to your profile?&quot; Herbert considered the possibilities, he never even though of not being the dominant male of this relationship, the shift in dynamic was not without its charm though. Elizabeth certainly enjoyed herself during their playtime. He smiled and a tongue rolled out in a sign of acceptance. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth copied her own settings to his profile and added a single new change so they can both experience feminine pleasures.<br />
<br />
Social Status: Breeders of the Pack<br />
<br />
Herbert read over both profiles and barked at her before she hit accept.&quot;Right, I should make us both aware. Can you believe I almost made us forget this reality? I&#39;d totally do it if you weren&#39;t here, that&#39;d be so air-headed.&quot; She giggled at her eagerness as she set their profiles to Aware.&quot;How would we ever turn everyone back afterwards?&quot; Herbert nodded his head as she hit accept for real this time.<br />
<br />
In an instant she was laying on the ground, her eyes closed due to increase in sunlight. As she held her eyelids shut and waited to adjust to the blinding brightness she felt something wrong all over her body. She could barely move her legs, arms and she could not feel her hands at all. A sloshy heaviness weighted her down, pinning her to the ground. As her eyes adjusted to natural sunshine, she opened her eyelids carefully, first seeing the grass in front of her now elongated mouth. She was lying sideways in grass. As she bent her neck and tried to move her limbs she was reminded of weird heaviness in her torso.<br />
<br />
She saw a dark blob turn into a familiar furry view of her husband Herbert standing in front of her. He seemed a bit off, now having some features she recognized as feminine as well as sporting a rather large belly. He, or rather now she, licked Elizabeth&#39;s face and then sat beside her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth tried to twist her body with all her power, but the struggle proved useless against the heaviness. She looked down to see what was wrong and as she glanced at her own inflated bulge of a tummy she immediately knew what it was. She got 10 puppies inside of her, which, combined with her small frame, made it essentially impossible to even stand up.<br />
<br />
Around her a bunch of other dogs were playing or sleeping or eating food they caught early. A whole tribe of dogs lived there in their own clearing in the middle of a forest. Chronivac was now on a single laptop in front of her. The only remnant of the erased human species.<br />
<br />
She tried reaching for it with her dog feet. Just a small change in her frame or lowering the number of puppies would make her able to move, and enjoy this new reality more fully. Unable to reach, she gave up. Just then Herbert pushed it gently towards her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth rejoiced, now able to reach it she&#39;ll make herself more comfortable. Or rather she would. But she had no idea how to use the machine. Since in this reality humans never existed they never invented anything, it&#39;d be impossible for a random dog, living in a random forest to use technology that never existed. Her memories and awareness were not enough to make up for the lack of knowledge on how to use a machine. <br />
<br />
Just then she felt a wave of heat spread through the body. The new sensation caused her teats to swell as they lactated uncontrollably onto the grass and ground. Herbert was similarity hit with that sensation.<br />
<br />
Unable to reach his own needs Herbert lowered his breast onto Elizabeth&#39;s muzzle, she suckled on a teat and growled to command Herbert to do the same. He lowered his body slowly, being very careful to protect his young and her offspring while maneuvering both his teats and his muzzle to connect them both into infinite loop of muzzle-to-teat. Now essentially lying on top of her he enjoyed the pleasured suckling on his teat as she did the same.<br />
<br />
They were both now getting worked up over the whole ordeal. And 2 dogs from the pack could smell it. Both were approached by a dog, these were dogs with pure instincts and no tact. One guided his dick into Herbert&#39;s pussy above Elizabeth&#39;s head. The other did same with Elizabeth&#39;s. Both rested on top of Herbert adding additional weight, locking both of them in place. It wouldn&#39;t matter how pregnant they are right now, because they wouldn&#39;t be able to move either way.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth stopped suckling and raised her head up, smelling something else that interested her more than task at hand. The doggy dick moving in and out of Herbert in savage and forceful way captivated her more than anything else. She gave it a lick and loving the taste she started lapping at it, adding to Herbert&#39;s pleasure as she would also lick his pussy at the same time. The dog&#39;s rapid movement made them cum very quickly. Elizabeth and Herbert just started getting pleasure as both of them released their seed inside of their breeding bitches. As the dick pulled out of Herbert, Elizabeth had cum splash across her face, the musk intoxicating her.<br />
<br />
Another 2 dogs came, aroused by the smell and sight. Dog after dog came and went, fucking both of them and every hole in their body. They didn&#39;t protest, they didn&#39;t complain. It was all they were here to do, it was all that mattered to them. None offered any kind of loving sign, it was all just bestial animal sex. Very soon Elizabeth and Herbert realized that due to them being insatiable, Chronivac made them unable to orgasm, so they were stuck on the cusp, always feeling a touch away but never reaching it. And yet they both clenched their pussy walls tight around every cock. Desperately milking them. Getting heavenly pleasure, but with hellish need for release.<br />
<br />
After a whole day stuck in one place they were both tired and sore and pent-up. Some of the dogs let them lick their sheath clean, providing them with protein-rich sustenance. Herbert got to walk to the nearby lake and drink some water. Elizabeth being unable to move whimpered at Herbert asking him to do something. Unable to do anything more, Herbert shoved his crotch into her mouth and released his bladder, sending a torrent of uncontrollable musky liquid down her throat. Despite the taste it was the sweetest thing she ever drank. Unable to keep up with the pace she chocked a bit, which made Herbert move his crotch, but not wanting to drown her. Unable to stop pissing, his piss hit Chronivac causing short circuit as the computer shut down, much to the shock of Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
It was all over, they were now stuck for the rest of their lives, sucking dicks for food , giving birth, breastfeeding and fucking every day until they&#39;re both dead. The whole world, everyone they ever knew was now just a horny dog in this world. They ruined all of it with their fetishes and they couldn&#39;t even ejaculate to the thought.<br />
<br />
Out of instinct, she rubbed the cum all over her fur, adding the male musk to scare the predators away. She was going insane from over-stimulation without release and that brought the base instincts out.<br />
<br />
Soon the strain of insatiability made both of them bestial and desperate to find a way to release. What started out as letting others fuck them , quickly evolved into going out of their way to fuck any male with even a drop of cum left in their balls. As soon as they gave birth they were already knocked up again. Others from the tribe helped raise their many young as their sex addled brains proved unsuitable for any motherly task other than breastfeeding. Marking their place in a society as breeding sluts.<br />
In total they gave birth to over 200 puppies in their lifetime, hoping to find some sort of release til the end of their days.</p>
