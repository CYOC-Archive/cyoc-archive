<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not necessary,&quot; he utters with a little laugh, sitting up and giving you a pat on the shoulder. &quot;You really should rest as much as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, really! I mean it. You saved my life, and I want to thank you in any way I can...&quot; You think for a moment or two, and all that comes to mind is sex. It didn&#39;t take long for you to be brainwashed into a toy, you realize. That makes you wiggle a little where you sit, suddenly feeling the need to have his cock in you, and you crawl toward him, pressing him down by his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; He frowns as you sit back on his hips, straddling him. His hands dart up to grab you by the waist, but he seems unable to do much more than that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really want to thank you,&quot; you murmur with a little purr, and his cheeks flush a deep red. You utter another giggle-- he&#39;s just so cute. &quot;This is all I could think of.&quot;<br />
<br />
You begin to grind your bottom down against his hips, and he gasps out a little whimper. You knew from the moment you saw him that he was a submissive type, but hey. So are you. Maybe the two of you can learn to be dominant together. <br />
<br />
The wolf boy groans and raises his hips up to meet you, another little whimper escaping his pretty lips. You can already feel the growing hardness in his groin through both of your pants, and you can&#39;t wait to claim his cock. He&#39;s such a handsome guy, and he saved your life. You owe him this, at least.<br />
<br />
You carefully unbuttoned his pants and pull him out, marvelling at the erection in your palm. He&#39;s not as big as Master was, but he&#39;s an impressive size for a human cock-- significantly larger than you. You give him a few good strokes and squeezes, and he moans as you touch him, taking the sleeve of his shirt between his teeth to stifle his ehimpers. He&#39;s a grower, too. As you slowly jerk him off, he gains another inch. You&#39;re practically salivating now. You can&#39;t wait to have Danner inside you.<br />
<br />
You remove your pants and shimmy forward, leaning down to nuzzle his cheek. He rubs against you affectionately, his eyes fluttering shut as he releases a ragged breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re really good kooking,&quot; you tell him, and that makes him blush again. &quot;And you&#39;re very kind. You&#39;ve done so much for me in the last day, alone. I wish I could have known you sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiles up at you, his eyes opening to regard you with adoration. You can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s just because you&#39;re about to fuck him, or if he genuinely likes you. It doesn&#39;t really matter though. You lean down and press your lips to his, and slide him into your recovering ass.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#39;t hurt you at all. Danner feels wonderful inside you, and he&#39;s much more gentle with you than Master had been. His hands move softly over your hips and your rib cage as you carefully grind your bottom forward and back. He squeezes you with a little whine, grinding his hips upward with each thrust that you take. His hands slide down to rest on your bottom, eliciting a moan from you.<br />
<br />
You ride him slowly, carefully, and he&#39;s so gentle with you. It feels so nice to he handled with care. He sits up to meet you, wrapping his arms around your torso and burying his face into your narrow chest. You gasp, grinding down on him harder as you comb your fingers through tossled brown locks.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Danner!&quot; You whine when he kisses your pectoral. Instinctively, he squeezes you closer to him, bringing his hips up, then down again as he bounces you in his lap. You can feel the pressure beginning to build as he gently massages your prostate with his warmth. You&#39;re going to come soon-- but you know that your body won&#39;t let you until he does first.<br />
<br />
Practiced, you bounce yourself with a little more force. You can recall several times that Master tied you up in his lap and made you dance until he came. You use some of the same techniques, wiggling yourself down on him and then quickly jerking up once more. With each bounce, Danner presses closer to you, and you know that he won&#39;t last much longer.<br />
<br />
A few more thrusts do him in, and you moan lowly as his sexy fluids fill you up. You come almost immediately, splattering yourself against his stomach. He doesn&#39;t seem to mind. Panting heavily, he pulls back from your chest, hands still resting on the small of your back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing,&quot; he whispers to you. You merely smile and lean down to kiss him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s do it again sometime,&quot; you tell him. He grins and kisses you back, pulling you down into the bed with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s,&quot; he murmurs happily. You lay down on top of him for a while, and eventually move to slip him out of you. He stops you, though, his hands resting firmly on your hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could we maybe-- um-- leave it in for a little while, maybe?&quot; You chuckle and ask him why, and his cheeks flush a deep red. <br />
<br />
&quot;It just feels nice to be inside of you,&quot; he admits. You smile, and kiss him on the cheek as you slide him all the way in again. He hums happily as you lay atop him. Shortly after that, you drift back to sleep.</p>
