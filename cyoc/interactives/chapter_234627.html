<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Bessie and Ashley please come up.” I announce, and the two girls got out of their seats. On their way up, they were in comments most of them were directed at Ashley. One stuck out the most.<br />
<br />
“Come on girl shake that ass.” Said the Casanova wearing a speedo for the two girls next to him that slap him in the head. Soon the two were on stage, and Ashley looked like she was upset.<br />
<br />
“Hey girls now I’ll admit I never expected this relationship change when we went through that whole trick. If it makes you feel any better, I apologize.” I said as I put my hands together in an apology.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to apologize Joey. To be honest it improved our lives a bit.” Bessie said and I raise my eyebrow in confusion.<br />
<br />
“In the original timeline, my dad still divorced my mom, but she got custody of me. I guess she was a major influence over my life given how the guys in the audience expect certain things from me.” Ashley said as she nervously wave back to the audience as if she was a shame of her past self which caused a bit of an uproar from the men in the audience demanding more. “ In all honesty, I liked my new life and Patty is a better mother than my biological mother was. I just wish that there was someway to fix that that I was always Bessie sister.” I smiled at her statement and turned towards the audience.<br />
<br />
“Well, one reality altering trick coming up. Once the trick is done, then the Ashley of the past will just be that the past.”  I announce, but I got a booing response from most of the men in the audience. “Ladies.” I said then several smacking sounds later in the boos died down. Making several silent wishes I snap my fingers and many stuff appeared to have nowhere.<br />
<br />
Once such as a big rectangular box on wheels that people can just walk into. I pulled Monique aside and ask her to get the German and the Colombian maids. I walked over to it and opened up both sides, revealing that both ends were doors. I finally walked over to the girls and grab each of them by the wrist before leading them to the box.<br />
<br />
I had Bessie stand at one and the box with the door open and place Ashley at the other end of the box with its door open. As Monique came back with the maids I stood at the side of the box and look at Bessie and at Ashley.<br />
<br />
“Now I need you two to step into the box go into the middle and hug as if your lives dependent on it.” I instructed, and Bessie and Ashley did as they were told. I close one end of the box as well as lock it and instructed my temporary assistants to get on either side. I joined Monique on the side that was still open and together all four of us rotate the box so that the audience can see through the open door.<br />
<br />
In the audience, they see Ashley and Bessie hugging each other tightly before I closed the door and locked it. I then look at the audience with a sinister smirk.<br />
<br />
“Now me and my lovely assistants will be spinning the box clockwise 10 time.” I announce as me and my assistants rotate the box 10 times before stopping with its side facing towards the audience. I stepped away and turned towards the audience.<br />
<br />
“Now what’s happening in that box is that Ashley and Bessie are now mixed together in a bit of a Croganberg abomination. Now I can’t show you it because it would be disgusting and Mrs. Brockman will probably hate me for all the puke on the floor. However, the only way to get them back is divide.” I said as I went up and picked up two divider blades now these were oddly design because they look bulky and it had two handles. I went back to the box motion Gretchen (the German maid) to come over with me and together, we met at the middle of the box. I handed her one of the divider blades and together we inserted the blades into the box with me placing the blade in the top part of the box while Gretchen put her blade in the bottom part of the box.<br />
<br />
“Now that the boxes divided it’s time to pull them apart.”  I said as me and Gretchen got back on the end of the box. All four of us pulled in the opposite direction, but the box didn’t want to split into two. I acted confused until I remember something then me returned to the middle of the box that had the blade handle sticking out with Gretchen following my lead. <br />
<br />
“I nearly forgot about this.” I said, as I grabbed the outermost handle of the blade on the top part of the box as Gretchen fallen my lead and grab the bottom one. Together, we surprisingly pulled out thin blades but if you looked at the boxes, it looked like the blades split into three thin blades each. Two still attached to one sided to each of the divided boxes well me and Gretchen hold the fifth and sixth blades. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that folks. I nearly forgot about this step.” I said an apologize tone.<br />
<br />
“Herr Joey” Gretchen interrupted me as she held up her blade to show that there was a word on the blade and pink wording spelling ‘Trixie’. “There is a name on these blades I believe.” Said Gretchen as she motions to the blade in my hand, which had blue wording spelling ‘Paul’. <br />
<br />
“Oh right, brief explanation. Since we are making them twin girls, and they have to be the daughters of Ashley‘s father James and Bessie‘s mother Patty. So as we took out these blades, we literally took out the genetic material for the other parents. That being Bessie’s original father.” I motion to the blade in my hand. “And Ashley’s original mother.” Motion to blade in Gretchen’s hand. “Speaking of genetic material.” I said, as I went over to the side and picked up it look like a glass. <br />
<br />
I then went over to Gretchen and held up my blade horizontally with the name facing down.<br />
<br />
“Can you please help me hold this?” I ask and Gretchen help me steady it horizontally. I then with my hand with the glass put the glass on the bottom part where the name would be. I proceeded to skid the glass across the name back-and-forth multiple times until the class was somehow filled with a blue liquid. Gretchen let go of the blade and I lift it up in the audience showing that both sides didn’t have the name ‘Paul’.<br />
<br />
I rushed over to what look like a table with a surgical tray and placed the glass filled with blue liquid on it. Then with my free hand, I placed a sheet over the surgical tray and the glass. I snapped my finger and the shaped that represented the glass disappeared; replaced with four smaller shapes. I removed the sheet and smiled as in the place of glass was four syringes filled with a white liquid. I looked back at the audience who were confused of what I was doing.<br />
<br />
“Nothing to worry about just material for an upcoming trick.” I said, as I went back over to Gretchen and took the other blade out of her hand. I toss both blades into the air and with a snap on my finger they turn into confetti. The audience was bewildered as I motion Gretchen to return to her spot on the other end of the boxes and I return to my spot.<br />
<br />
“Now with that done, we just pulled these apart.” I said as me and Monique pulled our half of the box in one direction while Gretchen and the Colombian maid pulled the other half of the box in another direction. “Spin these 10 times counterclockwise to return the girls to their original shape.” With this we spin the boxes counterclockwise 10 times. When we were done spinning, the boxes had the sides with the doors facing the audience.<br />
<br />
“And now let’s look at what we have here.” I said as me and Gretchen unlock the boxes and open the doors. <br />
<br />
Both girls stepped out the boxes looking drastically different from when they both entered. They were both now 5 foot 10 tall, had black hair, and green eyes. Both look like they inherited their assets from Patty but their height really emphasize on their assets. Their facial features were perfect combination above James and Patty and both girls were identical. The only way to tell them apart was the costume they were wearing which was the color of the bikini tops (Bessie: White with black spots, Ashley: Black with white spots) which they were still wearing.<br />
<br />
Both girls look at each other and we’re surprised how identical that they look.<br />
<br />
“Give it up for the twins, Bessie and Ashley.” I said, and the audience broke out into applause. Both girls looked at me and then hugged me.<br />
<br />
“Thank you Joey not only did you make me truly Bailey’s twin sister, and the memories I now have.” Ashley said sniffling as she let go of me.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing girls.” I said as Bessie let go of me.<br />
<br />
‘Really there’s anything we can do for you…’ Bessie tried to whisper.<br />
<br />
‘Again it’s nothing but my next couple tricks will help you out guys out in unexpected ways.’ I whisper back and I motion for them to get off the stage. Which they did as they race back to their old seats while the guys were sneaking glances as they pass only for to be hit by their girlfriends if they have any.<br />
<br />
“Hugh please come on up.” I said as Hugh got up as the twins sat down. On the way up, I noticed that his costume I guess he was trying to be a satyrs but his lack of muscle and Manley features wasn’t selling it. <br />
<br />
“For my next trick, I will need another volunteer another guy.” I said, causing most of the guys to look at me in confusion. “One that is wiling to give up everything,” I patted down my body to emphasize my point, “and exchange it with Hugh over here.” I said as Hugh got on stage. To my surprise, a couple if not, 10 hands shut up.</p>
