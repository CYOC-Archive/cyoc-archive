<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Go on, and give me twenty more reps, David!&quot; Aden ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right man, right!&quot; Dave answered as he thrust the three hundred pounds up above his chest and back down.<br />
<br />
It was basically the same thing at eight o'clock at the gym. He would train his friend to become bigger and just watch in awe as he saw his muscles expand and contract. Aden envied his friend... He envied everyone. Aden lived a harsh life, and the Gods decided to poke fun at him by giving him the freakish height of 7'2 feet tall. Even though he was three-hundred pounds. Most of it being muscle, it didn't really show as much as he wanted it too. Not to mention, his special structure couldn't stand anymore weight without having some achy problems.<br />
<br />
Aden was a fairly handsome young man. He was twenty-two, and a widower. He was tanned, had shaggy blond hair, a perfect white smile and the most gorgeous set of emerald green eyes you'd ever see. He also had two kids, ages nine and two. The eight year old was named Jaffar. Who was the spawn of 'surprise sex that only Germany can offer' as Aden would call it. While Guy was the 'planned' spawn of him and his wife. <br />
<br />
Aden's life was fairly plain after he moved away from Germany at the age of eight-teen. And by plain, I mean boring... lame... uneventful. He returned to his home in a secluded area, where he was greeted by Jaffar with a hug. Even at such a young age he had a strong grip. Which probably meant he was going to be a strong fella as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be in bed, young man!&quot; Aden jived as he picked up his son and carried him to his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was waiting! Cause there was a package thingie that came for you! I left it in your room.&quot; Jaffar retorted as he let his behemoth-father tuck him in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, still. You should be asleep... Anyways, good night little one.&quot; Aden said as he knelt down to kiss his son on the forehead.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Aden showered, and slipped on a pair of boxers. He hopped on his computer... In which he spent at least 50% of his day/night on. As the monitor slowly turned on, the light casted a blue tinted glow that lead straight to a big cardboard box next to the large bed. Of course, he didn't notice this. Instead he went to a chat room.<br />
<br />
You have now entered TheHaven<br />
<br />
Der Stark Wolf: Hi guys!<br />
JudoPuffies: Heehee! Hi Wolfie!<br />
Kaimifactionz: Sup Aden<br />
iluvPSO: What's up?<br />
Der Stark Wolf: Nothing much. <br />
-an hour later-<br />
Der Stark Wolf: O gingersnap<br />
LordMarriner: lol wut?<br />
Der Stark Wolf: I just saw this package thing.<br />
JudoPuffies: It's my male/male pron collection. I got bored with it.<br />
Der Stark Wolf: I'll burn it right away, then.<br />
JudoPuffies: Pfft! I AM INSULTED! (JK) &lt;3<br />
iluvPSO: Go open it then. Besides we ALL know you're a lil bi-mo.<br />
Der Stark Wolf: Yeah &gt;_&gt; ... I forgot. I'll open it and crash for the night.<br />
JudoPuffies: NIGHT! &lt;3<br />
iluvPSO: Later on dude.<br />
Kaimifactionz: Seeya man.<br />
LordMarriner: kkbibi<br />
<br />
<br />
Aden signed off of AIM and got up from his chair to go open this box. Once he opened it, he first saw a wooden box with a card on it. He quickly picked up the card and read it in the monitor's dim lighting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear your life is boring. I bet you wished you could change some things. Or at least add some variety. This'll do the trick!<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
   Your friends from CYOC~<br />
<br />
PS: Be sure to read the instructions!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CYOC... What the shit?&quot; Aden asked allowed. What could this stand for? But once he exaimed the box, he noticed that CYOC must stand for 'Choose Your Own Change'.<br />
<br />
He opened the wooden box to find a bunch of bottles with tear-dropper caps. And a couple of pills. Aden found a little booklet. It had a few numbered rules.<br />
<br />
1) Chew the white pills to revert back to your normal self.<br />
2) Chew the blue pills to undo your latest change.<br />
<br />
He looked in and saw two containers, one with at least eighty white pills, another with eighty blue pills. Aden was a bit creeped out. But he continued on reading.<br />
<br />
3) Each drop from a vile will increase your change with each drop of liquid. The liquid must be dropped on your tounge. For safety measure, apply the change liquids slowly.<br />
<br />
3a) Regardless of most changes, you will always keep your normal mental state. So have no fear. This disregards sexuality, and mental switchers, of course. Mental changes work by a scale of five. With each drop the mental change could be just a weak twinge, or a very big switch around.<br />
<br />
3b) Height works by 2 inches for each drop. Weight works by 10 pounds for each drop. Animal/Mythical creature changes work from a scale of 1 to 10. It can be a simple change that adds some hair, pointed ears, longer nails, any small change to something that completely changes your physical being.<br />
<br />
4) This box will only open to your touch. But be aware if it is left open, just about anyone could get into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aden was dumbfounded. This sounded ridiculous! But this also seemed... Like the thing he would need to perk him back up!<br />
<br />
Aden looked through the viles and saw just about everything. Height reducers/increasers. Muscle mass changes. Fat changers. Hair changers. A variety of animal changers. Mythical Creature changes. Mental changers... Just about anything could be changed with these things.<br />
<br />
Aden quickly picked up the height reducer and used six drops of it... Nothing happened. He set the vile back and closed the box, stashing it in his computer desk's drawer. He then went into his personal bathroom and looked in the giant mirror that barely showed all of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing...&quot; Aden was a bit saddened. All that build up for nothing. But if he would of read the 5th instruction. He would of seen that it takes approximately one minute for a change to occur. And that minute was up!<br />
<br />
Aden gasp as he saw himself shrink. He saw that he must've lost... 10 inches! He was overwhelmed with joy. But not only did he shrink in height, but his muscles worked to form around his new skeletal frame. His decent eight pack turned into eight bricks that just pushed out. While his fairly average chest heaved out to show two meaty pecs. His arms expanded a bit, revealing more tone to the rest of his arms. Same goes for his legs. He also saw as his penis, which looked kind of small on his old body, looked pretty average... even above average on his new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels great!&quot; He exclaimed as he searched himself over.<br />
<br />
He went to bed that night. Feeling very excited for once. The next day was going to be great!</p>
