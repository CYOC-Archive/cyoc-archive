<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>In the world Gary, Jack, and Sandra knew, the highway that ran past the university was 
a heavily-trafficked 6-lane affair, where franchised fast food and strip malls stretched in 
both directions.  But now, with no university, it was a lonely 2-lane strip through the 
trees.</p>

<p>As Gary drove, straining to see through the rain-splattered windshield -- the cracked 
rubber on the wipers wasn't doing much to clear it -- he muttered, mostly to himself.  
"Okay, maybe the university just moved.  I mean, maybe it's somewhere else.  Or maybe 
we'll just find a <i>different</i> university.  One with a physics department.  Quantum 
physics..."</p>

<p>Finally, Gary saw some bright lights on the side of the road ahead, and as he got 
closer, he felt better -- it was a modern-looking gas station/convenience store.  He didn't 
recognize the logo at the top of the sign, "Esso," but the important part was right 
underneath that, where it said "24-Hour Food Mart."  He pulled in next to the pumps, 
under the overhang, where they were the only car.  The three got out of the beaten-up 
vehicle and headed inside.</p>

<p>As they walked in, the nondescript 20-something male who was sitting at the cash 
register quickly refolded a fold-out page in the magazine he was looking at and stashed it 
beneath the counter.  He mumbled something that might have been "Evenin', folks."</p>

<p>More to check out his changes than anything else, Jack made a beeline for the men's 
room, but the door wouldn't yield to his pushing.  This time the clerk was a little louder.  
"Men's outta order," he said.  "Use the ladies'.  Nobody in there."</p>

<p>Jack sighed and stepped a few feet to the right to use the other door.  He walked in 
and was instantly thankful that the room seemed to have actually been cleaned at some 
point in the recent past.  There was even a mirror above the sink that didn't have too 
many scratches on it.  In the harsh glare of a humming fluorescent light, it was obvious 
that he was now wearing a pink jacket over his black denim shirt, and his body wasn't 
shaped right -- his waist was far too narrow, his shoulders had become thinner, and his 
hips had expanded somehow.  And then he noticed that his dark hair seemed a bit longer.  
And then he noticed some swelling on his chest, beneath the jacket and shirt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gary was talking to the clerk while Sandra was walking slowly around the 
convenience store, looking at the various junk food items on display.</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno," said the clerk.  "I just moved here a coupla months ago.  My ma got 
sick, and --"</p>

<p>"But you haven't heard of Hilltop State University?" asked Gary.  "It was --"  He 
suddenly realized the problem -- if they'd built a university anywhere but on top of that 
hill, they wouldn't have called it that.  "Okay, never mind.  Just -- what's the nearest 
university?"</p>

<p>"Uh..."  The clerk scratched his head.  "Yeah, like I said, I'm not from around 
here..."</p>

<p>"Okay, then where'd you go to school?" demanded Gary, and immediately regretted 
his choice of words as the clerk's face fell.  "I coulda gone to Chicago Community College," 
he said, "but then my step-ma had her accident --"</p>

<p>Gary waved toward a display rack that was sitting on the counter.  "Can I at least look 
at one of these maps?"</p>

<p>The clerk shook his head.  "Not without buying one, you can't.  I'd get in big trouble -
-"</p>

<p>"Fine, fine," said Gary, pulling his wallet out of his back pocket.  Fortunately, it 
seemed to have stayed relatively dry.</p>

<p>"Hey, that looks like a pretty nice car," said the clerk.  "Don't you have one of those 
GPS thingies in there?"</p>

<p>Gary looked up from his wallet, then followed the clerk's eyes through the plate glass 
window to the spot where the beat-up Range Rover had been parked.  Instead, there was 
now what looked like a shiny black luxury sedan.  Gary looked back at Sandra, who was 
standing in front of the magazine rack, a Consumer Reports Auto Buying Guide in her 
hands.  She dropped it, and the two of them ran outside.</p>

<p>They circled the car cautiously, almost as if they were worried it would explode.  
"Studebaker Commander XL," Gary read from the silver letters attached to the trunk 
lid.</p>

<p>"What did you say?!" exclaimed Sandra as she walked to the back to see for herself.  
Meanwhile, Gary had walked around and was peering in the side windows, verifying that 
there was a screen in the middle of the dashboard that was probably "one of those GPS 
thingies."</p>

<p>"I was just looking at this exact car in the magazine!" Sheila exclaimed.  "My dad's a 
car guy, so I've heard of Studebaker, but they went out of business in the '60s, I 
thought."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gary realized he had a car key in his pocket.  "Guess they're back in 
business," he said, pulling out the key, attached to an alarm fob, and only being slightly 
surprised when a press of the "unlock" button caused the car's lights to turn on and the 
door locks to make mechanical noises.  "But the bigger mystery is -- why do we have one 
all of a sudden?"  He turned toward Sandra, and his jaw dropped.  "And how long have you 
looked like <I>that?"</i></p>

<p>"Huh?" asked Sandra.  Her wavy red hair now extended slightly past her ass, and that 
was only a minor detail.  She now had an hourglass figure, with melon-sized breasts, a 
tiny waist, and oversized hips.  Her jeans had become a tight denim miniskirt, showing off 
her shapely legs, made even shapelier by the black sandals with 6-inch heels that she 
wore.  Her white sweater was now more of a halter top, showing off her flat stomach and 
the charm dangling from her pierced navel.  Her face didn't seem to have changed much, 
although it was covered with plenty of makeup -- the lips might have swelled a little, but 
that might have just been the effect of the bright red gloss they were now painted 
with.</p>

<p>At that point, a cute, dark-haired woman came running out, wearing a pink jacket 
and blue jeans, clutching a purse.  "Where the hell did you guys go?!" she asked.  "Where 
the hell did our car go?!"</p>

<p>"Jack?!" said an incredulous Gary and Sandra simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Sandra?!" said the woman, almost simultaneously with the two of them, and then 
blurted, "You look like a hooker!"</p>

<p>"And you look like a girl," shot back Sandra.</p>

<p>"Uh, let's get in the car," suggested Gary.</p>

<p>"I look like a girl because I <i>am</i> a girl," said Jack as he -- <i>she</i> got into 
the back seat.  "I watched myself change all the way in the fucking mirror."</p>

<p>Gary figured out how to turn the car on as Sandra rummaged through the glove 
compartment.  "Okay, here," she said, pulling out one of the manuals gingerly, due to the 
fingernails she'd suddenly realized were about half an inch long and fully manicured.  She 
read the title aloud, "2008 Studebaker GPS Navigation System Supplement."</p>

<p>"Nah, this thing seems pretty self-explanatory," said Gary, pressing virtual buttons on 
the touch-screen display.  A computer-generated map appeared with the black outline of 
a car in the middle of it, showing that it was sitting just to one side of a slightly curved red 
line.</p>

<p>"So you think we need to find the university?" asked Sandra.  "A university?  I mean, 
we keep changing.  Or, at least, Jack and I keep changing."</p>

<p>"Yeah, maybe we should try to get help quick," suggested Jack.

<p>"Hmm," said Gary.  He pushed the screen a couple of times.  "Okay, here's the 'points 
of interest' list.  What do you want me to look for?"</p></p>
