<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The community college in Moon Lake wasn&#39;t on the edge of the town, but the town had put up a large park around it, and William figured that that was part of the town&#39;s origins. If most of the people turned into some kind of animal, he figured there would be a greater preference for wild things rather than what was typical of human civilization. And in a way it also left the air with a rather pleasant smell of spruce and pine trees. That made him glad that he had moved his family to Moon Lake, even with all the other factors that had surprised him and his wife. Sure, a town largely populated by werebeasts was rather odd, but so far things had been as the college dean had told him. They were in control of themselves, not the other way around. <br />
<br />
Of course, even with that, there were some things that unnerved him. He was certain that his older son wanted to join were-society, which would put his family in cooperation with the town&#39;s laws, but what he had curiously researched on the town&#39;s online directory, he was beginning to have some second thoughts about allowing his son to engage in it. The ceremony to induct a new were didn&#39;t say on how it would be done, but the ways the condition was spread gave William the idea that sex would be the means with which Nate would be transformed. That was something that William wasn&#39;t going to allow. Being bitten or getting a blood transfusion was one thing, but Nate was a legal minor and wouldn&#39;t turn eighteen for two years, and William knew he would be a bad father if he let his son have sex with some were, regardless of gender. He wondered if Martha was aware over how their son would lose his humanity.<br />
<br />
The evening was quiet as he opened the back door to his car and set his briefcase on the floor of the car. He was about to back up and shut car&#39;s back door when he heard the pounding of footsteps behind him. He turned only to see pointed muzzle with a triumphant smile flying at his face. Long reddish brown hair framed the reddish orange fur on her face. She had lost her clothing and William noted that her impressive bosom looked even more impressive in her fox-like form with the sides of her muzzle, jaw, the underside of her neck, her breasts, belly, and her inner thighs covered in white fur in comparison to reddish orange fur everywhere else and the black fur on her ears, and like gloves on her forearms, hands, feet, and lower part of her legs. Her long brush-like tail stood tall and helped her maintain balance as she flew through the air toward him.  It was largely a red orange colored tail with a white tip and despite her nudity, William found himself more transfixed by her tail than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hello again, hot stuff,&quot; Yvette said with a smile as she tackled William knocking him onto his back in the backseat of his car, lucky that she didn&#39;t drive the back of William&#39;s head against the frame of the car door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yvette!&quot; William gasped as he raised his hands, trying to push her off of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Anderson,&quot; Yvette moaned back as she reacted and made sure that his hands made contact with the fur covered orbs that were her breasts, &quot;I told you I liked you and I get what I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
William tried to scoot out from under her and trying to get away from the extremely forward werefox, though he also found himself getting aroused at the firmness of Yvette&#39;s breasts. Despite their size, there was no sag to them. It was as if female weres had no worries regarding bras and back support. Regardless though, he didn&#39;t want to be a werefox himself, and despite his less than loyal behavior in the past with regards to his marriage with Martha, he had decided to be better than he had. William did love Martha after all, his actions were more the result of his looking toward short term support rather than true love, and even at the moment, he didn&#39;t have any short term interest in Yvette.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want you,&quot; William said weakly as he tried to get to the other side of the car.<br />
<br />
Yvette only smiled and leaned forward to grab William by his shoulders. He tried to scoot away, but found her grip surprisingly strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;because I&#39;ve been waiting all day for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
William could only watch as Yvette climbed up and above him, with one hand rubbing her dripping vagina, which was matting the fur around the juncture between her legs to a degree. Yvette also did her best to push her chest out to make it more pronounced.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as much as you&#39;ve said no...&quot; Yvette looked down on him and reached with her other hand to undo William&#39;s belt and pants&#39; button, &quot;your scent says, &quot;please ride me, Yvette... ride me...&quot; And I intend to do just that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you don&#39;t have to do this,&quot; William answered and struggled as he felt the transformed werefox pull his pants down and revealing the growing tent in his underwear, &quot;you won&#39;t gain anything from it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but I will... another conquest to notch on my belt and show how GOOD I am,&quot; Yvette brought her pointed muzzle down to lick William&#39;s cheek, &quot;We werefoxes are very sexual... we don&#39;t go around being hunters like werewolves or kings and queens like weretigers, werelions, and wereleopards... we value how good we are in bed. And you look like one who knows what he&#39;s doing in that department.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is wrong,&quot; William struggled, but found himself unable to break free. Despite her smaller size and definitely sexualized body, Yvette was far more powerful than him physically.<br />
<br />
Yvette only laughed, &quot;Don&#39;t try and fool me. You have the scent of MANY women on you. You may be older and you may be married... but deep down you&#39;re like me. You see what you want and you take it when you see it. And I want you... NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
William only gulped as Yvette pulled down his underwear and allowing his now erect penis to stand up from his body. Despite the feeling, he was somewhat afraid as Yvette had apparently caught the scent of every old dalliance that he had had before. It gave him the feeling of being powerless that he didn&#39;t want. It made him realize just how wrong he had been to cheat on Martha in the past now that a new student was using her powers to try and rape him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wrong then... and this is wrong now,&quot; William tried to kick at Yvette, only to have the werefox pin his leg down with her own leg. His voice was weak and shaking as he spoke, &quot;I admit that I hadn&#39;t been that faithful to my wife in the past... but I let my own desires get the better of me when my wife wasn&#39;t physically desirable at that time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I bet your wife isn&#39;t hot like me,&quot; Yvette said with a smile.</p>
