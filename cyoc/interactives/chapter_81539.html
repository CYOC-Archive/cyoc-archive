<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark and Danny went to the showers in the gym to clean themselves after their workout. Mark stripped down as <br />
normal and got under the water before shampooing his long beard, the bottom half of it completely grey. Now <br />
that he was 40, his muscular body was starting to soften, although his thick body hair, also getting a hint of <br />
grey, made it hard to make out the muscles underneath in the first place. Washing the suds out of his beard, <br />
he wondered whether the Chronivac could make it longer. It was already half a foot long yet he wanted it to <br />
reach its terminal length. He might look a bit ridiculous with such a beard but it couldn't hurt to try. He'd <br />
have to get around to it after helping Danny. Speaking of which, he looked over at the man who was now older <br />
than him now. Danny was reluctant to get into the shower at first, but now he was under the water and <br />
lathering up his fatter body which was just as hairy as anyone else in their family. He now had a full beard <br />
that was slowly getting longer, currently reaching about 2 inches off the chin. The majority of it was grey in <br />
colour, and the same could be said for the ring of hair around his head, his crown was practically the only <br />
place on his body devoid of hair at all. He looked uncomfortable with his body, like it was foreign to him. <br />
Mark felt for the man. Maybe he shouldn't of changed his awareness in the first place. It must be terrible to <br />
be constantly changing without knowing why. Of course, Mark had shown him exactly why and yet he just ignored <br />
it, assuming it was a video game despite the fact he made a change to himself. <br />
<br />
Mark had finished cleaning himself and went to get changed, patting Danny on his hairy back to let him know. <br />
Danny nodded and followed him out, not wanting to spend another minute in the building filled with fit, <br />
healthy men. He knew he used to be just as in shape as they were when he arrived, and now he was as fat as his <br />
dad, who used to be his grandpa. Yet at the same time, he felt like he was always 44 and everything else was <br />
an illusion. It was easier to just pretend he wasn't aging at an advanced rate, no matter how obvious it was <br />
to him. Nobody else seemed to notice it anyway, all except for Mark that is. In the morning, the man used to <br />
be his uncle, he was sure of it, but now he was his brother. His younger brother. He envied him, wishing he <br />
could look as good as he did at his age. Sure the beard was getting out of hand, but he wasn't one to talk as <br />
it seemed his own facial hair was starting to grow wildly. And he wished he was muscular like him. Even when <br />
he was 40, he had a round gut that started to hang over his waistband. Maybe that programme his brother showed <br />
him actually worked. It would explain why he felt this way. They had to get home quick before he was his dad's <br />
age. Then he felt a weird shudder that only affected his face. Mark was staring at him like he was deformed. <br />
In fact, Danny's facial features were changing, his nose slightly bigger, his lips a bit thinner, his eyes <br />
became a darker shade, the shape of his face got subtly rounder. He had lost the small details that made him <br />
Simon's son, now resembling Bryan more. Mark couldn't believe it, the man was his nephew this morning and now <br />
he was his uncle! Danny was going through a similar state of disbelief, now that his brother used to be his <br />
grandfather the day before. The speed they got dressed at noticeably sped up and they were out of the gym <br />
within a couple of minutes. Danny got behind the wheel in the car, the seat somehow already adjusted for his <br />
increased bulk, and started it up before he realised his eyesight had worsened since the last time he'd <br />
driven. Grumbling to himself, he dug through the glove compartment and pulled out a pair of glasses that he <br />
used for driving. He adjusted the mirrors, getting a glimpse of himself at one point looking like he had been <br />
middle aged for a while now. He felt a twinge of despair, hoping it'll all be over soon. <br />
<br />
He pulled out of the car park and joined the highway. About a third of the way into their journey, they'd <br />
ended up in one of the road's infamous traffic jams. He punched the steering wheel in anger. Of all the times <br />
to get a traffic jam it had to be the day he was rapidly aging to death! They'd once sat in traffic for 4 <br />
hours before. He remembered Mark got out and jogged the rest of the way, leaving him to wait it out by <br />
himself. But how could he remember that day if he had spent the previous 2 hours almost doubling in age? His <br />
head was throbbing from the influx of memories competing with the perception of his changes. If they didn't <br />
get this sorted soon, he might do something he'd regret. Anything to get peace of mind. Mark was worried as <br />
well. He knew that Danny was 48 now and these traffic jams tended to last an hour at this time of day. By the <br />
time they got home, he'd probably be Simon's age. He glanced over at his uncle. He had grown even heftier now, <br />
a good amount of fat bulging over his jeans and resting in his lap. He hadn't reached his original dad, Jay's <br />
size yet but he had definitely surpassed his old replacement dad, Simon, in heftiness. However given his <br />
height, which was a good 4 or 5 inches taller than himself, he might actually weigh the same as Jay. Danny's <br />
beard was rivalling his own now, and he was combing his fingers through it in frustration, both at the traffic <br />
jam and his aging predicament. It was completely grey and starting to verge on white. He had a pair of glasses <br />
perched on his nose, originally to help him see better while driving, but now they were a permanent pair, <br />
rarely ever leaving his face. <br />
<br />
Mark really wished he could help Danny right now, but the only person who knew about the Chronivac, now that <br />
he'd made Jay unaware, was his dad. At least he assumed he knew about it. It was in his bedroom after all. Yet <br />
he didn't know how the old man would react after hearing of the changes he'd made. Simon might end up fixing <br />
everything and he didn't want to be an awkward teenager again. Was his new-found maturity worth Danny going <br />
through this mental torment as he achieved even more maturity? They were already starting to move, but they'd <br />
been deceived by that before. He turned to look at the hefty man who looked stressed as anything. Danny also <br />
turned to look at his nephew and gave him a smile he hoped looked reassuring but ended up obscured by the hair <br />
covering his face. They started to move again, only to stop after a yard. It was going to be a while.</p>
