<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s note: If thread title is needed, it should be specific, as the Anderson thread is one of several that branches off of the first Moon Lake chapter, and many also exist within the Earth 1 &quot;story-verse.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The room was fairly quiet and somber as Samantha Twist sat on one side of the rectangular conference table while Chief O&#39;Hara sat to her immediate left. Across from her were Akane Tachibana and the acting &quot;head&quot; of the Skulk&#39;s security services, Yamato. With Daisuke still recovering from Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agent freaking out over Daisuke looking like an FBI agent and committing suicide by cop, Daisuke&#39;s cousin was picking up the slack with their present points of crisis. That left them with the issue of a second agent arriving in Moon Lake and raising more questions on how to deal with the situation and frustrated wondering as to how many agents could one man send from Alabama to Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment we can be thankful that he seems to be remaining at his hotel room,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara spoke as he finished his briefing, &quot;but he is under instructions meet up with the first agent and go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose we can&#39;t fake him out with another false message?&quot; Samantha asked curiously and sounding hopeful for some means of preserving some measure of good fortune.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is only going to put us in a position that we cannot fully control,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara sighed, &quot;it&#39;s likely that the two agents knew each other and that would mean we would need to know a fair bit about our John Doe&#39;s habits... and since they&#39;re supposed to meet IN PERSON, an email game is only going to play things along to a point where we can&#39;t keep the rouse up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I would also assume that because we do not have a recording of the instructions to kill Harold Jenkins that this man cannot be arrested under conspiracy charges?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
Chief O&#39;Hara slowly nodded, &quot;Not in any way that would stick. We could make the arrest on the grounds of what was overheard, BUT we&#39;d need to be able to prove that beyond all reasonable doubt, which would require a recording and not something that could lead to a &quot;he said/she said&quot; argument in court or one where the defense will make the claim that we misunderstood what was said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we can still keep an eye on him?&quot; Samantha asked, and watched as the police chief nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve also put our security agents in more plain clothes attire to avoid the sort of situation where they&#39;ll think the FBI is involved,&quot; Yamato spoke up, &quot;that might allow us to pretend to be a curious local and give him directions that would send this guy on a wild goose chase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d work if we can keep him distracted to the point where he ends up going away from Moon Lake,&quot; Samantha mused only to have her phone suddenly go off. Samantha was quick to check the text message while the police chief and the Skulk&#39;s personnel raised eyebrows at the interruption. However, the fact that it was from Frances and the number &quot;911&quot; was included, Samantha had some nervousness that either some member of Frances&#39; family was hurt or that Frances, herself, or Ben was hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, something appears to be up,&quot; Samantha said to the others and returned the call, and was quick to speak when she heard her wife answer, &quot;What&#39;s going on, dear? Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Physically... yes,&quot; Frances spoke up, &quot;but we have something that could relate to the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha blinked and then remembered that Jennifer Harper was still attending therapy sessions to deal with the fact that she&#39;d been forced into were society and with confidence building concerning her family&#39;s arrival for the wedding. When that realization hit her, Samantha was quick to try and make sure that at least things were progressing well on their end.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust they aren&#39;t having difficulties, right?&quot; Samantha asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it would appear that stresses and fears have raised some issues Harry,&quot; Frances answered over the phone, &quot;particularly as he responds to things that Jenny feels and fears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded and looked to see that the others were watching her closely. They surely overheard at least part of what Frances said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s had a nightmare... and a bad one that involves Dieter Wilhelm murdering him when he learns that we&#39;ve tricked him out getting Jenny,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;he came in and shot Harry as the ceremony began to end...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think its a prophecy dream?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what Harry described, I&#39;m sure it was vivid enough for him to fear that it is,&quot; Frances replied, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t think that it actually is a prophecy dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha was quiet as she listened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, even if it is, that doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t change things to change events to make sure that the dream doesn&#39;t come true,&quot; Frances continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll talk with the others,&quot; Samantha assured her wife, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can put things together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which can help,&quot; Frances replied over the phone. &quot;The big thing is that Harry&#39;s nightmare has also included how things could go wrong if Dieter Wilhelm is allowed to attend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame we don&#39;t have a picture of him,&quot; Samantha gave a sigh, &quot;we might be able to deny him access that way and any violent measures would take place on terms more to our control rather than his.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t need a picture,&quot; Frances said slowly, &quot;Harry saw and described Dieter Wilhelm accurately to Jenny and I. Jenny was the one who recognized he was accurate. It&#39;s what could make his nightmare a borderline prophecy dream and will make protecting Harry and Jenny our most important task.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; was all Samantha said for a moment, &quot;and what did Dieter look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry described him as about 6 feet tall. Black hair. Maybe a little above average build but with a bit of a pot gut on him, probably from already living the &#39;high life&#39; too long,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and Jenny said that description WAS accurate. So even if it isn&#39;t a prophecy dream... it&#39;d certainly merit some action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, and thank you,&quot; Samantha replied, &quot;Love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you too,&quot; Frances answered, and with that the call ended.</p>
