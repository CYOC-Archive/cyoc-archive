<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric had a relatively good evening and early night. It was true that he and Julie were limited to dinner and homework, but that wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. Melissa and Martin Stovall seemed eager to even as questions on his day as well as Julie&#39;s. Eric did notice the smiles that formed on their faces when both he and Julie reported that while their days were good, they got better when they got to see each other. He supposed that was pride on their part in seeing that their daughter had found her one true love. That made for fairly friendly conversation as well.<br />
<br />
There was some talk about the new henchmen that had been sent, which was the first Eric had heard on the issue, but Martin assured him and his family that things were fine and that for the moment things were safe. The agent had so far confined himself to the motel he was staying in and occasional forays to the diner. He also did a little bit of shopping to get cereal and paper plates, paper bowels, and plastic spoons, but he hadn&#39;t actually done enough to be a real threat to anyone, and was still under tight observation in case he did decide to try anything. Martin looked directly to Eric and Julie when he finished with further assurance that they were safe. The two eventually accepted that. Eric thanked him and the two returned to their homework from there.<br />
<br />
&quot;A guy came here just to kill someone because some other guy wants the woman the guy &quot;to be killed&quot; is marrying?&quot; Eric said slowly as they settled down in the Stovall living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some times people do odd things in the name of love,&quot; Julie commented, &quot;which creates problems when the love isn&#39;t returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded, that made sense, and he was glad that Julie&#39;s father was doing everything that could be legally done to keep everyone safe. The two focused on getting to the last bits of their homework for the evening, though Eric soon found something Julie had said ringing in his mind that made him wonder things. Eric had had to privately admit that he might never truly know &quot;what&quot; love was, but he did know that he&#39;d fallen head over heals for Julie. She&#39;d done so much for him. She&#39;d been a friendly face to talk to and helped him adjust to being a normal in a town full of were-beasts, even though she&#39;d never been a normal once in her life and that their courtship had resulted in him becoming a weremer as well. It made every smile Julie made feel so much more to him. It made it so good just to see her and hear her laugh. Eric never wanted his true love to be unhappy.<br />
<br />
But in her teaching him about what it meant to be a weremer, Eric also knew that their &quot;love at first sight&quot; ability was strong and fairly solid, much like what werefoxes described as their bond between mates. To Julie, Eric had always been her one true love and the one she&#39;d been destined to be with. Eric now wished to be her one true love and could see that she was his as well, but that also created the worry over what might happen if he had either never noticed that Julie&#39;s attention went beyond platonic friendship or if for whatever reason he hadn&#39;t fallen in love with her. Would that make her unhappy? Would that doom her to being alone because no one else could be her one true love?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... Earth to Eric!&quot; Julie called to him and shook his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Eric shook his head for a moment and looked down to see that he&#39;d written his answer down on the wrong line for the assignment they were working on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Julie asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I was just thinking about something,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;It relates to happy I feel to see you happy... be with you, even if it limited to homework and stuff like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel the same way,&quot; Julie smiled as she watched Eric erase where he&#39;d written down his answer on the wrong line.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never want to see you unhappy,&quot; Eric stated, &quot;I always want to make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But when you commented about love not being returned... even though it had nothing to do with us,&quot; Eric continued, &quot;a part of me nervously wondered what might have happened if either our relationship stayed platonic or for some reason I didn&#39;t fall in love with you... would that have...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If things were just platonic... I...&quot; Julie said slowly, her own thoughts now nervously turning to that. &quot;If you remained &quot;just friends&quot; and our bond never grew... I&#39;d probably have remained friendly and tried to find a way to encourage that bond to form... but in the end, if that bond never forms or is broken... I&#39;d probably be heartbroken, but I&#39;d recover and at least hope for friendship. As a weremer&#39;s &quot;love at first sight&quot; isn&#39;t always necessarily limited solely to one person, and thus why some weremers may take new loves if one dies before the other... But... it&#39;s not something I&#39;d really want to think about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not something I want, either,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;but the thought came to me and made me fear that if that happened... that I would have hurt you ... and I don&#39;t know if I could live with myself if I&#39;d ever done that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... maybe it&#39;s best not to worry,&quot; Julie said after a moment, &quot;We did fall in love and made each other very happy. That&#39;d be the thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I suppose...&quot; Eric admitted and the two hugged before moving to finish their homework.<br />
<br />
The finished with no further worries on that issue of things that might have been but didn&#39;t happen. Things happened perfectly between them and it was like a storybook romance for both of them, the fact that they were only fourteen aside. That was the best thing for both of them. As they finished their homework, Eric looked over to a nearby clock and sighed. Julie was about to question it when her mother came downstairs for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you two coming with your homework?&quot; Melissa spoke from the stairway.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just finished, mom,&quot; Julie answered as she and Eric got to their feet. Eric focused on putting his materials back in his backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s about time I got going,&quot; Eric said to her. The two hugged and Eric kissed Julie&#39;s cheek. &quot;Thanks for spending the afternoon with me. I had a great time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So did I,&quot; Julie replied, &quot;and we&#39;ll have many more good years head...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we fell in love,&quot; Eric smiled to her, &quot;the best thing that ever happened to me so far...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t had our wedding yet,&quot;  Eric answered, &quot;that won&#39;t be until we&#39;re at least eighteen... and if the dreams we&#39;ve had have been &quot;prophecy dreams&quot; that you&#39;ve said to me, our children won&#39;t arrive until a few years after college. Those moments will surely top what we&#39;ve had together so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Julie smiled back. They hugged again before Eric headed toward the door. Julie slowly walked behind him. He slowly opened the door and then turned back to her. Julie smiled and told him, &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and smiled as well, &quot;Yes... on the way into school, lunch, and then on the way home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie could help but smile as Eric then left and turned back to her mother feeling glad on how well things had worked out. She had found her one true love and he loved her back, that was great and made her happy. She then made her way to get ready to shower and get ready for bed.<br />
<br />
Outside, Eric was quick walk on his way back home. He felt glad that things between him and Julie had worked so perfectly. A part of him wished he could remain by Julie&#39;s side for the night, but they both had to get ready for the night and a part of his mind was concerned on what Julie had suspected regard his mother bringing Coach Johnson home with her. His mother might only be indulging in her bi side, if she had been rejecting it before, and he supposed that was fine, but he wanted to make sure that his parents weren&#39;t going through &quot;different&quot; issues now.<br />
<br />
He was quick to return and found his parents standing at the front door as Coach Katherine &quot;Kat&quot; Johnson mad her way to her car. The Middle School girl&#39;s gym coach was in her human form and dressed, as she would be too big to comfortably drive her car in her weretigress form, though his parents were both transformed. Eric could clearly see a brown furred werecat standing beside a male werefox, who&#39;s &quot;fursona&quot; matched a fairly typical red fox, though there were some other differences. His father was still fully dressed and had taken off his shoes and socks while his mother was completely naked, but both stood together quietly and calmly with very little, if any, concern on that situation.<br />
<br />
But then it was night, so it was okay that they were transformed and his mother&#39;s fur largely hid anything that would be too embarrassing if it had  happened in public, so long as she wasn&#39;t aroused. For the moment, Eric couldn&#39;t detect any real sign of arousal on his mother, though,it wasn&#39;t like Eric knew he could seriously complain on that issue. After all, he and Julie had had sex in front of her parents in the Stovall pool while the other two weremers enjoyed themselves in every possible way as well. And at the time, while Eric remembered being surprised at Julie wanting to do that, a part of him wasn&#39;t instinctively troubled over the issue. That said, however, raised some wonder on had gone on while he had been out and brought his concerns back to the worry over what he and Julie had talked about. With that, he continued his approach toward his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Eric,&quot; Martha said to them, &quot;did you have a good time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;but we need to talk...&quot;</p>
