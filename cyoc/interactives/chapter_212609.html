<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff nodded in agreement. He started walking towards the stable&#39;s doors, but he immediately lost his balance. He whinneyed in annoyance, and tried to walk again, this time trying to pay attention to all of his legs at once. He started, unsteady, until he got the hang of it. He nickered happily.<br />
&quot;Well, you seem to handle it quite easily, girl,&quot; Said Dean. He looked up at Jeff&#39;s face, and petted his muzzle. It felt good. <br />
&quot;So, what are you saying, Sahara? You think you can carry me?&quot; He smiled, and putted the saddle on Jeff&#39;s back. The alien feeling it gave him almost made him run in fear, but he managed to control himself. Dean jumped onto his back, holding the reins tightly. He stroked Jeff&#39;s neck, and whispered, &quot;Easy, girl. Calm down.&quot;<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not a horse!&#39; Neighed Jeff. &#39;Well, I am, but I don&#39;t have the mind of one! You don&#39;t have to treat me like that! It&#39;s so humiliating!&#39; Although... Dean&#39;s strokes and whispers really have made him more calm.<br />
&quot;I know you think I should treat you like a human male, Sahara, but listen to me. You&#39;re a horse. A mare. If I&#39;ll treat you like a human, it would seem rather strange... and treating you like a horse will make your training way easier. Got it?&quot;<br />
Jeff snorted. He wasn&#39;t happy about it, but it wasn&#39;t the worst. He stomped the ground, eager to go on his first run. Dean laughed. &quot;Thanks, man-I mean, horse!&quot; He laughed at his own joke. &quot;Come on, girl, let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
Jeff started walking towards an old riding path. To his suprise, Dean wasn&#39;t heavy for him at all-in fact, he barely even noticed the weight on his back. He focused, trying to move faster. His akward walking turning into a stable trot. &#39;Left hind, left front, right hind, right front,&#39; Thought Jeff. &#39;I got it!&#39;<br />
He neighed, and started trotting quickly. Dean laughed. &quot;I see you got it. Come on, Sahara. You think you can go faster?&quot;<br />
Jeff&#39;s responded by galloping forward. He was so fast! Galloping as a horse was so fun!<br />
After about a hour of riding, Dean stopped him. &quot;Whoa, girl, stop. Let&#39;s go back to the farm. You did a really good job, Je-Sahara. With some more training, we&#39;ll win that race easily!&quot;<br />
Jeff turned. He wasn&#39;t feeling tired at all; His new, strong boddy was filled with energy, and he galloped again, returning to the farm.<br />
On the way back, Jeff felt a sudden need to relive himself. Dean felt his discomfort, and asked &quot;What&#39;s the matter, girl?&quot;<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t respond. He&#39;d wait until he&#39;ll be alone, he decided, and then he&#39;ll take care of his buisness. But his silence turned him in. Dean stroked his neck, mumbling calmly: &quot;Oh, I know what you need. Come on, don&#39;t be shy. Horses are not familiar with shyness; You should not be too.&quot;<br />
If horses could blush, Jeff would&#39;ve been completely red by now. He lifted his tail in shame, and felt the urine and shit falling from his anus. This felt so humiliating-especially since he was a girl!<br />
When he finished, Dean said. &quot;Sahara, please, don&#39;t be ashamed of yourself. It&#39;s only natural. No one will care.&quot;<br />
Jeff whinneyd, and continued trotting towards the farm.<br />
<br />
When they finally arrived, Dean directed him to his stall, and jumped off his back. He removed the saddle and the reins, and petted Jeff&#39;s side. &quot;You did great!&quot; He said. He pulled out an apple from his pocket. &quot;You deserve a reward!&quot;<br />
&#39;Seriously?&#39; Thought Jeff. But as the apple&#39;s sweet scent filled the air, he lowered his head, reaching Dean&#39;s hand. Dean raised the apple up to him. Without fingers, or even arms at all, all Jeff was able to do was to catch the fruit in his mouth, and pulling him whole into his mouth. &#39;Wow, apples taste so good for me now!&#39; Thought Jeff happily. He enjoyed the apple, nickering happily, and Dean smiled and gave him another one. &quot;I knew you&#39;d like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the sun went down, dean pulled a bucket full of hay. Jeff stomped the ground in anger. He don&#39;t want to eat horse food!<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, Sahara, really? You know your sense of taste have changed, so why not give it a try?&quot;<br />
Jeff snorted, but opened his mouth and tasted the hay. It tastes... a bit sweet, and not bad at all. He ate the whole bucket without even realizing it. Was he really that hungry?<br />
Dean filled his stall&#39;s basin with water, and Jeff went down, licking the water and grabbing it to his mouth. He struggled a bit, but managed to drink enough. <br />
&quot;Sahara!&quot; Said Dean, making Jeff&#39;s ears twitch and a whinney escape his mouth. &quot;I&#39;m back!&quot;<br />
Jeff haven&#39;t even noticed he was gone-he was too busy drinking. He nickered, wondering what would they do now. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ve checked it, and it really seems that everyone thinks you were ever my horse. I&#39;ve even found some old pictures of you-look!&quot;<br />
He brought his phone closer to Jeff&#39;s eyes, and jeff was shocked. Dean&#39;s Facebook page was full of posts with photoes of his new boddy, and even a picture of filly-which, apperently, were him-suckling from a mare&#39;s tit, with the wording &#39;Our new filly have just born! I&#39;ll name her &#39;Sahara&#39;!&#39;<br />
Jeff nickered. Thou a bit freaky, it was really cool. He wondered how other people would treat him, and especially his parents-will they just see a horse, a mare, or will they sense something&#39;s off?<br />
Dean guessed his thoughts. &quot;Your parents have never known you in this reality-I checked. Your brother, Jake, is thier only son, and &#39;Jeff&#39; is not mentioned anywhere. For everyone&#39;s knowledge, you were always a horse, my horse.&quot;<br />
A few minutes have passed, while Dean and Jeff stood quietly, Dean stroking his fur. <br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough for today. You should go to sleep-you&#39;re probably exhosted.&quot; He went out of the stable, turning his head, and said: &quot;Good night, Sahara! See you tommorow!&quot;</p>
