<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laurie Mason hurried down the school hallway and entered her English classroom.  She set down her plain-looking backpack by her desk and rifled through it to get out her books.  She had to rush to get to class, since she had forgotten her backpack in the library.  <br />
<br />
She was absentmindedly thinking about her boyfriend, who she felt was a little overbearing in their relationship.  Friends told her that this was a problem, but she really didn&#39;t mind.  She liked being her boyfriend&#39;s little toy.<br />
<br />
As she removed her books, a piece of paper fell out onto the ground.  She picked it up and set it on her desk with her books.  As the teacher began to lecture, she realized the paper had writing on it, but it wasn&#39;t one of her notes.  It looked like a list of questions.  At the top of the paper was a heading that read:<br />
<br />
&quot;To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so bored, just sitting there. Here&#39;s a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend. &quot;<br />
<br />
Interesting... unlike her English lecture.  Laurie decided to fill in some answers.  Digging out her pink pen, she read the first question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a guy... would your handwriting be messy?<br />
<br />
Laurie didn&#39;t think messy writing was something all guys had.  She answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  It would be neat.&quot;<br />
<br />
She moved onto the next question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a guy... would you like blue?<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t prefer blue, but she didn&#39;t hate it.  So that&#39;s what she wrote.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be fine.  I wouldn&#39;t hate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t notice that her handwriting was actually neater than it was before.  It was also a bit more blocky, and more masculine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a guy... would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
She figured straight hair would be the easiest to maintain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her formerly wavy hair fell straight down her back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a guy... what would be your favorite color?<br />
<br />
She had her own color preferences already, and she thought it was good when guys were more open to girly things, so she wrote her own current preference.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like light pastel pinks and lavenders.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a guy... what color would your hair be?<br />
<br />
A simple enough question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandy blonde.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hair color shifted from brown to a lighter sandy color.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a guy... what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
Another easy question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Light blue.&quot;<br />
<br />
The color of her irises changed to match.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a guy... would you use body care products?<br />
<br />
Hmmm... she thought for a moment, then made a decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d use simple shampoo and conditioner, and a bit of cologne, but not too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she moved to the next question, her nose caught scent of something all of a sudden...  She realized it was men&#39;s cologne... and it was coming from her!  Shocked, Laurie dug a pocket mirror out of her bag.  Looking in it, she could see that she had been changing.  Her hair and eyes were different, her face had taken on a distinctly more masculine shape.  She noticed that her handwriting had changed as well.  On the verge of flipping out, she noticed the next line on the note read: <br />
<br />
&quot;Do not stop. If you continue, your dream will come true. But if you stop, you will meet an unpleasant end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uh-oh, she thought.  This note was magic, and it was changing her... into a guy!  Her mind raced, but she couldn&#39;t help but think that her life wouldn&#39;t have to change much.  She was a girly girl who was a bit submissive.  She could become a submissive girly guy... she didn&#39;t have a problem with that.  Maybe she would even enjoy it...<br />
<br />
She continued, with her goals set firmly in her mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a guy... would you like sports?<br />
<br />
She chose girly sports.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like figure skating, gymnastics, and dance, though I wouldn&#39;t be particularly good at any of those.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a guy... would you wear sneakers?<br />
<br />
Sneakers were fine, but there was nothing about being a guy that meant she couldn&#39;t dress like a girl when she wanted.  That&#39;s what she thought, and she would make it a reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only wear women&#39;s footwear.  I choose my shoes as appropriate for the occasion.  I&#39;d wear sneakers when running or doing an appropriate outdoor activity.  I would often wear girl&#39;s ballet flats, because they&#39;re comfortable.  I&#39;d also like wearing women&#39;s boots and high heels because they look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shoes she was wearing changed into purple ballet flats.  She enjoyed them a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a guy... would you wear pants?<br />
<br />
Continuing with her previous thought process...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d where tight women&#39;s pants such as jeans, and sportswear sometimes.  More often I prefer cute skirts and dresses, or short shorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her jeans turned into a cute, flowy, pink skirt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a guy... would you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
Still deciding to be girly...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like dangly earrings and I&#39;d wear girly necklaces and bracelets.  I also have a belly-button ring and a cute nose stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of the mentioned items appeared on her body.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a guy... would you have big muscles?<br />
<br />
Though she wanted to be a girly guy, she couldn&#39;t resist just a little bit of masculinity here.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have strong, lean muscles.  Nothing over the top.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt her muscles ripple all over her body, growing and gaining definition.  Her breasts shrank as well to a reasonably muscular chest, with a bit of hair on it.  Her body hair became more coarse and masculine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a guy... would you be into girls?<br />
<br />
She knew this question was coming, and she was prepared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be bisexual.  I would prefer partners who would allow me to live my submissive desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a guy... would you shave?<br />
<br />
She chose the girly way again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;d prefer to be clean shaven.  I&#39;d also shave all of my body hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rough male hair that had previously appeared on her body disappeared, having been shaven away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a guy... how big would you be down there?<br />
<br />
Laurie had to think hard on her decision.  She knew most guys would want to be big, but she was shooting to be a different kind of guy.  She finally worked up the nerve and wrote her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only 1-1/2 inches flaccid, and 3 inches erect.  My balls would be small and nutsack would be tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt a wave of nausea that passed briefly as her insides rearranged and changed into male anatomy.  Her penis and balls formed.  Small, just as she described.  She reached her hand under her skirt and felt them, fascinated by the strange feeling.  Her tiny cock was erect from the pleasure, but it still didn&#39;t take up much room.  Laurie then realized that &quot;he&quot; was a much more appropriate pronoun for ...him... to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 16: If you were a guy... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
<br />
He continued the cross-dressing pattern.<br />
<br />
&quot;A cute purple blouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
His shirt changed into the girly blouse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you would were a guy... what kind of underwear would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I would only ever wear women&#39;s underwear.  I like regular brief panties, thongs, and hip-huggers.<br />
<br />
His underwear turned into a pair of smooth hip-huggers.  They were tight and the feeling made him constantly erect, though he was small enough that the panties still contained him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a guy... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be a 5 in most respects.  But I&#39;d be very smart when it comes to understanding and acting like women.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt his wits dim a bit, but he became very aware of how to best act like a woman would.  Women&#39;s fashion trends entered his head and acting on them seemed second nature.  He adjusted hit posture in his seat to be much more how a woman would sit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a guy... what other clothing would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d wear a padded push-up bra to try and give my flat chest as much cleavage as I can get.  I also have a pair of breast forms at home that I wear when I am trying to go all out, but I don&#39;t use them all the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a guy... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes? (Don&#39;t lie)<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be 17 years old,&quot; (his current age).  &quot;5&#39;10&quot; tall, and 170 pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
His body changed as he gained height and his body filled out, becoming fully masculine, despite his feminine tastes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 21: If you were a guy... what type of shoes are you wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute, white, women&#39;s sandals with a 3 inch heel.&quot;<br />
<br />
His shoes changed to the ones described.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 22: If you were a guy... what other accessories would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be wearing tasteful make-up, including mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, foundation, and lipstick.  I am an expert at applying make-up and it accentuates my feminine features and reduces how masculine my face looks.  I also carry a woman&#39;s purse with the usually expected belongings inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt make-up on his face.  He pulled out a pock-mirror from his purse and checked it.  It was well done, not a smudge or error.  His face was generally masculine, but with the help of the make-up it actually looked quite pretty, in a feminine way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 23: If you were a guy... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d wear it short and simple.  Nothing fancy.  I&#39;ve experimented with long hair and feminine styles, but I&#39;ve found I prefer using wigs for that purpose, to make it easier to go back and forth.&quot;<br />
<br />
His hair became short and simple, as described.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question 24: If you were a girl... what would your name be?<br />
<br />
&quot;My legal name is Carl James Mason.  I have taken to going by Carla.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Carla read the last line:<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to have a happy life as a woman, pass this on to the next person. Male or female, it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Carla couldn&#39;t believe it.  He loved his new form as a male sissy slut.  He thought about his life and realized he had a tough time expressing his sexuality and gender identity due to persecution from his family.  His single mother was the only one who accepted him and he lived with her now.  <br />
<br />
He faced the same challenges here at school but he had a lot of supporters as well.  Most of his friends were female and he got along very well with them discussing girly topics.<br />
<br />
He had had several short relationships with both men and women.  Though they were accepting of him generally, they had a harder time providing for his need to be subservient.  Now he had found a boyfriend who dominated him just the way he liked.  Thinking about his boyfriend gave him an idea: he would pass the note on to his boyfriend, who would then become his girlfriend... the thought made Carla hard.<br />
<br />
After class he met up with his boyfriend in the hallway.  In his sandal heels, bare legs, and flowy skirt he sashayed over to him and greeted him with a deep kiss.  &quot;My master...&quot; he breathed.  &quot;I&#39;ll have a surprise for you later... but only if you spank me first... I&#39;ll see you at home after school...&quot;  He spoke in his best seductive voice and it was obvious his boyfriend was getting hard.  He felt his boyfriend&#39;s crotch and felt his large dick rising in response.  He gripped it and while his boyfriend was distracted he slipped the note into his pocket.  Then he kissed him again and moaned in a feminine manner while stroking his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Not in the hallway!  Get to class!&quot; a teacher interrupted them abruptly.  His boyfriend was nearly speechless but managed to croak out &quot;I can&#39;t wait...&quot; and the two headed off to their separate classes.</p>
