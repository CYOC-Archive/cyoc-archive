<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer lounges on her abdomen, one hand idly fingering her still sensitive pussy, as she tries to figure out what she should do next. She obviously isn&#39;t human and that transformation that Kyle cursed her with must have triggered when Sarah dropped the bee in her hand. Though all things considered being half bee was better than most of the alternatives since she actually liked the little things. But she was unsure what would happen if anyone saw her so best thing would to be to go home, she had the sick days to spare, clean up and get dressed in something that would fit, and come up with a plan. That decided she sits up and gathers her things, stuffs them into her bookbag and stands up to head back to her house, staying in the forest to avoid notice. She cautiously flaps her wings and they start flapping at a impressive speed, a surprisingly soft buzzing the only sound besides moving wind, and she is lifted off the ground. Moving forward she finds her vision is sharper and her reaction speed faster so that, combined with the help from her antennae, she is able to zip through the forest at a pace similar to riding a bike. The excitement of flying makes her forget her current problems as she lets at a cheer while she rushes through the trees.<br />
<br />
It does not take long till she gets to the edge of the woods outside her neighborhood, in fact she manages to get to the fenced off section that is her yard. She carefully peers over and seeing that no one is out, most should be at work or school, she hops, well flies really, over the fence and crouches down to avoid detection. Realizing what she is doing she shakes her head, &quot;Come on Jennifer, your not some thief or ninja coming to invade your house,&quot; and stands up before walking to her back door, unlocking it with her key, and entering before locking it back. She then heads to the bathroom but not before she stops by the kitchen to take a drink of sweat tea, her body almost demanding the sugar. She drinks one full glass before taking another with her, thinking that her insane sugar craving probably has something to do with making honey as well as the calories needed to fly. &quot;Well, maybe I can relax my diet then, I wonder how many calories I burned with just that short flight, plus honey production likely means less of it going to my hips.&quot; Once in the bathroom she steps into the shower, happy that it is a larger model than most, and cleans herself down. She gets a little delayed, and has to clean up again, as her scrubbing down arouses her body again, honey dripping from her lower lips, &quot;Okay, this can get annoying but oh damn does it feel good, ahhh!&quot; After she cleans up she dries off, her down taking a bit longer to dry, and heads to her room.<br />
<br />
Once in her room she opens her closet and stands back to look at the full length mirror and get a good look at her new body. What she sees causes her to stare, partly in astonishment, partly in appreciation, and a bit in lust. Standing before her is a golden goddess with skin a faint golden color that sets off her black lips, nipples, and pussy with shimmering gold hair coming down to her breasts. Her eyes also have a metallic gold color with the iris being larger and set against a black sclera. She also sees the cute pair of pointed elven ears just barely poking out of her hair and to downy, black antennae swaying above her head. Looking lower she sees the evidence of honey oozing from her large nipples as we as escaping from her slit to drool down her thighs and drip on the floor, leaving a trail of golden sweetness. The thought of such a treat causes her to lick her lips before her long, black tubular tongue stretches down to wrap around and clean one nipple before moving to the other nipple and clean it before the hollow tip covers over it and sucks, bringing both delicious ecstasy and honey.<br />
<br />
Finishing with her treat her eyes then drift to her four arms, two at her shoulders and two just below her armpits, covered in a supple yet resistant black exoskeleton that has the same sense of touch as her skin had, if not more sensitive, going to just past the elbows before turning to sinfully soft down that alternates between glittering gold and matte black that extends to her shoulders and stopping at her collar bone. Focusing on her fingers she notices something she missed earlier, at the tips where her nails would be there are small stingers that extend from each finger as she focuses. She stares surprised and plays with extending and hiding them away, the opening so small and tight it appears invisible and feels like it&#39;s not there when retracted. She is happy she has some sort of natural weapon though she doesn&#39;t know what the venom, if she has any, would do. Looking at her feet she sees the three long claws, tarsals she remembers them being called, extending from each of her flattened heels that now sport small suction cups underneath. The claws come together to form a surprisingly steady pseudo-foot but lifting one up she sees them separate and she plays around with moving the ball of her heel and limber claws to grab and pick things up, seeing that they would indeed be good at holding on to things, even going so far as to extend the outer claws to the side and almost makes grasping claw like in one of the toy catching machines only much stronger and more dextrous. She observes that chitin also covers her lower leg up to mid-thigh before again switching to gold and black bands of down that extend to cover her cute bubble butt but leaving her with a reverse bikini line between her thighs.<br />
<br />
Finally she turns around to see behind her where the two main attractions are. First her large gossamer wings that she stretches out to bring the double pair into full view and judging them to each be three feet long and two feet at their widest, though their curving shape gives them a large surface area. What interests her are the small hooks that connects the lower pair to the upper one because it is these that cause the distinctive buzzing sound if she remembers correctly, &quot;Note to self Jennifer, pick up text books on bee biology and study.&quot; Then she looks down at her large bee abdomen. Looking at it she sees that the bottom is actually flat and covered in a black exoskeleton that is actually kind of soft and springy though still feels tough, kind of like leather, while the top part looks rounded and is covered in the same gold and black down as her arms and legs. It extends three feet out from just above her butt, connecting where her tailbone is, though its gentle curve and slight droop means it actually only reaches out about two feet normally and she practices with curling it tighter, lifting it to be flush with her back, and even brings forward from between her legs, to work how to minimize and hide it. She can also swing it side to side and set it on her lap which allows her to sit down in a chair with it, though she would be sitting a little more forward than usual. While it rests in her lap she examines the stinger and sees that it is not a stinger but an ovipositor like bees used to have, and some wasps still do, to lay eggs in things. Feeling it she finds it to be firm but pliable like really stiff leather, about seven inches long when extended, an inch thick at the tip before widening to three at the base. <br />
<br />
Standing back up from her examination she considers getting dressed when she hears something.</p>
