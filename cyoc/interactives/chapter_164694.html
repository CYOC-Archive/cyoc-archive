<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;One last thing, doctor&quot; interrupted Jeff&#39;s mother in law, Queen Shannon O&#39;Brian. &quot;You know how the soul of the crazy that tried to kill poor Jeff ended in my daughter&#39;s stomach, don&#39;t you? It was only a temporary measure. Since she hate so much my son-in-law, and because he now have the stomach of a succubus, it was decided <strong>he</strong> should be the one digesting her sins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see. Her soul was only given to the princess to wait until he had totally cicatrized. Well, Jeff should be able to hold that soul in his new stomach and safely digest its sins now. But I would still like to be here during the transfer, to make sure everything goes as it should. Do you want to proceed now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was rather surprised by this news, but wasn&#39;t going to object to it. Anything to help him adjust to his new feeding needs, after all! &quot;It&#39;s probably better to do it sooner rather than latter…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Princess? Do you know how to process?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded and placed her mouth near the scar her husband had above his stomach, like she was trying to kiss said organ trough his skin, and blew. But instead of air, it was said damned soul she was blowing into his stomach. It felt strange to Jeff, but not unpleasant, and he could already feel the torment of his would-be killer feeding him.<br />
<br />
One she had finished, Jenny pushed herself off Jeff and let Dr. Lorelei examine him. &quot;Everything proceeded as it should. Congratulation, young man, you&#39;re punishing your first damned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff instantly understood something was wrong when he saw Shannon gently took Jenny to the other side of the room. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jeff. I was blind to the hubris of my own daughter, and as a result Nitha tried to kill you. My unwillingness to see how deranged she had become made me an accessory to what she almost did to you. As punishment, Hell&#39;s tribunal condemned me to the same punishment than my Nitha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny tried to intervene, but her mother&#39;s grip on her was to strong. And when she decided to scream at the doctor Shannon&#39;s other hand covered her mouth, letting Lorelei pursue. &quot;As you know, a demon can&#39;t die unless god decide it should. As a result, most demons getting the same punishment as me become a secondary identity to whoever the tribunal choose to be their executioner.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, Lorelei forced Jeff to take her soul, to absorb it in his stomach and as a result, her body got similarly absorbed by his. Once all of Lorelei&#39;s body disappeared, Jeff&#39;s one changed to look almost exactly like the doctor used to be. Same age, same porcelain-white skin, same long blond locks, same golden cat-like eyes, … The only differences being the two scars from Jeff&#39; surgery and the two wings born from the love he shared with Jenny.<br />
<br />
Said princess could feel that it was Jeff soul that inhabited this body, because it was the soul of the one she loved, the soul she was linked too. But she also knew that he wouldn&#39;t act as Jeff right now, couldn&#39;t. Because while the soul was the same, he currently wasn&#39;t Jeff, but his other self, Dr. Lorelei.<br />
<br />
The being in the bed for her part, was surprised by how she felt and the way she thought. While she still had full access to the memory and knowledge of Jeff, her main-self, it wasn&#39;t who she currently was. No, instead she was Dr. Lorelei. She didn&#39;t only have the appearance of the blonde succubus, she also had gained all her memories and knowledge. In fact, she was even thinking the way Lorelei would. (Or at least, the way she would with Jeff&#39;s soul.) All that because she currently WAS Lorelei.<br />
<br />
That said, just like the love between married demons, the familial love of hell&#39;s inhabitants come from the soul. She may be Lorelei, she wasn&#39;t Nitha&#39;s mother. (Even with memories that said otherwise.)<br />
<br />
The blond doctor then looked at her princess, her wife, the person her soul desired the most. She may love that person with all her being, it still felt a bit awkward. Not only was Lorelei an adult in love with a teenager, but also a doctor in love with one of her patients. She was glad her main-self, Jeff, was still a teenager.<br />
<br />
&quot;P… Princess?&quot; Lorelei might have become Jeff&#39;s other self, unlike him she couldn&#39;t stop herself from calling her by her rank, the habit had been drilled in her since early childhood after all.<br />
<br />
Princess Jennifer was looking back at her in an heart wrenching way. And how could she not? Where second away was her human boyfriend now stood her doctor, an adult that show her a side she never wanted to see, an adult that somehow inherited Jeff&#39;s love for the young royal. It must feel creepy.<br />
<br />
The teenage succubus looked in the direction of the chronivac, only to see the thing had disappeared. Lorelei misinterpreted Jenny&#39;s sudden fear and turned back into Jeff. &quot;Do you feel better with me as my main-self?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking, she simply nodded her answer, not trusting her voice to do so. Timidly, she waled in the direction of the bed and her husband. &quot;Jeff? It&#39;s… It&#39;s you? <strong>Really</strong> you?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Off course it&#39;s me, Jenny. I know I have another self now but she&#39;s a succubus, just like you, she can&#39;t take on a male appearance. But you&#39;ll have to accept that I <strong>do</strong> have another self now, that I&#39;ll need to be her from time to time, and that you love her just as much as you love me. In a way, she <em>is</em> me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want you to be Dr. Lorelei. I want you to be Jeff, to be <strong>YOU</strong>!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And most of the time that&#39;s who I&#39;ll be. But understand that I&#39;ll need to be Lorelei from time to time, even if your father&#39;s new law will cut drastically how much I&#39;ll need to in the long run.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His own doctor tried to poison him. If he had succeeded, he would have become this traitor&#39;s obedient slave. So to prevent that, and thanks to how hell&#39;s tribunal punished Lorelei, he decided to make it so only a member of the royal family can be a royal doctor, and <strong>only</strong> a royal doctor. And currently the only member of said family to be a doctor, is my other self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in love with <strong>YOU</strong> Jeff! <strong>NOT</strong> my doctor!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s my other-self now, Jenny. Being married to one mean being married to the other, even if you don&#39;t like it. And because of the new law, Lorelei will need to become acquainted with your father&#39;s medical file and recommend new doctors to all her non-royal patients. So don&#39;t search me tomorrow, I&#39;ll be too busy being her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, does that mean you know the content of my medical file?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head &quot;Like all demonic doctors, Lorelei is under a geas that enforce doctor-patient confidentiality. She can&#39;t share any of a patient medical data without said patient&#39;s explicit consent or, in the case of a minor, their parents consent. Not even with her main-self. That said, I can&#39;t be me and Lorelei at the same time, so if I ever get sick it might be problematic.&quot;</p>
