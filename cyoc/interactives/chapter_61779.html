<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The arrival at the school's central office was quiet and met with no exquisite fanfare, but then no one at the school likely expected us. As Officer Jenkins and I made our way in, we approached a secretary busy at a desk. It took her a few moments to finish the work he was working on. When he did look up, he took one look at me, and gasped slightly in surprise before regaining his composure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something I can do for you, officers?&quot; he said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said calmly, &quot;We'd like to speak with Wayne Hireman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I inquire as to what reason you wish to talk with him?&quot; the secretary asked, as if trying to cover for his employer, &quot;is this a drug search? Has a kid done something that actually warrants an arrest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our reasons have nothing to do with the school,&quot; Officer Jenkins answered, &quot;but at the moment, I'm sure he has the time to answer a few questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These questions do not implicate the school in any way?&quot; the secretary questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I gave a low growl, voicing my own annoyance at being questioned by someone whose job was not to question anybody.<br />
<br />
The man gulped nervously and then pressed a small intercom button on the phone on his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, there are a couple of police officers here to see you,&quot; the secretary spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does the tiger want? I heard him growl through the door,&quot; Wayne Hireman answered from his end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know, sir,&quot; the secretary responded, &quot;they want to ask you some questions, but they refused to say what they are or what they are about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they intend to frame me or the school?&quot; Wayne Hireman asked.<br />
<br />
I tried to growl as softly as I could.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not think so, sir,&quot; the secretary said nervously, &quot;I think you ought to see them, sir... I don't want to be eaten!&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed heavily. The man had been filling heads of his staff with these lies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Wayne Hireman responded, &quot;you may show them in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the secretary answered and terminated the intercom connection, he then turned to us, &quot;if you'll come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He got up and lead us over a couple of steps to a wooden door with the placard &quot;Wayne Hireman, School District Superintendent&quot; on it, like Officer Jenkins and I couldn't read. How someone could cling to such stupid racism truly frustrated me, though I did my best to make sure that the secretary wasn't obviously seeing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were never in any danger of being eaten,&quot; I said to him before following Officer Jenkins in.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
We entered the office to find Wayne Hireman seated at his desk with his computer on, by the humming sound that I heard, but I didn't try and look to see what was on the screen. To a certain extent, the place felt like the proverbial &quot;lion's den&quot;... now the analogy for me, may not be the easiest, but it was the best analogy I could think of. He looked up as we entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are these questions that you felt required harassing my secretary?&quot; Wayne Hireman questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're presently investigating the murder of Joshua Marksman, who like you was a member of the hate group R.A.M.,&quot; Officer Jenkins spoke, &quot;we believe you might be able to help us get some description of who the possible suspect is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He likely stands beside you, ma'am,&quot; Wayne Hireman dismissed it, &quot;Marksman was a personal friend of Beauregard's, and since his deception of good and honest people has not turned the state of Montana into a police state where all those who know that the human race is the only sentient race are incarcerated for believing the truth, he sneaked in and began his secret campaign of murder, just as Beauregard tried to warn your police chief before he fell for the biggest sack of lies since the invention of the Democratic Party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is enough,&quot; I growled at him, &quot;the murder was done by a human assailant as the result of an argument between him and Marksman. Get off your racist horse before it costs you an election.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only only other person interested is a philandering Neanderthal of a man who also lacks moral fiber,&quot; Wayne Hireman smirked, &quot;and the first amendment allows me to say what I want, and hate whom I want... and I really don't hate anyone. I'm merely looking out for the children to make sure they are not eaten by a pair of murderous animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins interjected before I could respond as she noticed my ears lowered and a snarl on my lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marksman's sons saw the argument,&quot; Officer Jenkins spoke, &quot;the assailant was human. We believe him to be a R.A.M. member that likely felt betrayed by Beauregard for stealing his money, and confronted Marksman on the issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man certainly couldn't have truly believed the truth,&quot; Wayne Hireman commented, &quot;Beauregard took the money for safe keeping. It wasn't used for personal means...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was in his personal account,&quot; I answered, &quot;You have no way of knowing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we're not trying to establish motive, Mr. Hireman, we are trying to get some possible description or idea as to who the suspect is,&quot; Officer Jenkins added quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? The two boys couldn't give a full description?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They lead us to believe that they were sneaking back into the house when they returned,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied, &quot;They knew there was an argument but could not get a good look at the man arguing with their father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... a rat, you mean,&quot; Wayne Hireman answered, now sounding much more cooperative, &quot;What can I do to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No more BS?&quot; I questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I do not trust you, and you do not like me,&quot; Wayne Hireman responded, &quot;but R.A.M. was what was needed to save this town from great sorrow. You've broken the organization and sent the man who held it together to Federal Prison... by that reason alone, I have no reason to help you... but a man who did agree with a great man was murdered by some &quot;fair weather friend&quot;. As soon as R.A.M. faced official scrutiny, he quit and murdered a real member. That is treason, as far as I am concerned, and I will do what I can to help...&quot; he glanced at me for a moment, &quot;regardless of who is doing the investigating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better then nothing,&quot; Officer Jenkins said to me, &quot;Now, Mr. Hireman, first, when Beauregard formed R.A.M. was it all at once, or did he have recruiting drives for members over time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He started with the ranchers that he commonly associated with,&quot; Wayne Hireman answered, &quot;and then moved on to the various city and public officials and anyone else who would believe that the male here and his mate are dangerous... the first real meeting though wasn't until the organization was essentially complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you associate with many of the other members?&quot; I asked, &quot;or were you just used as a &quot;microphone&quot; to make noise for Beauregard's cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I earned a management position,&quot; Wayne Hireman answered, &quot;largely organizing protests and deciding who would be at the protests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ever notice anyone who seemed somewhat volatile?&quot; Officer Jenkins asked, &quot;Like he had a short temper? Probably not as fervent a believer as you are... or one who was close to Beauregard? Someone who would likely feel betrayed by Beauregard's pocketing of the donation money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likely also armed at all times,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good parts of that could be almost anyone that was in R.A.M.,&quot; Wayne Hireman commented, &quot;the feeling betrayed part... but most of them wouldn't go that far... or at least weren't brave enough to go that far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely you came across someone who would fit that possible description?&quot; Officer Jenkins wondered.<br />
<br />
Wayne Hireman stopped and thought for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a couple of people who fit that fairly well,&quot; Wayne Hireman said after a moment, &quot;One was a Kevin Mars, works at the local butcher shop... seemed to me that he worked their to take his anger out ON the meat. From what Beauregard told me, he also didn't really want to join RAM. Thought the tigers here would be a good source of business. But Beauregard convinced him that human lives were not worth a few extra bucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the other?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other was a rancher who lives out west of town, named Dusty MacClure,&quot; Wayne Hireman answered, &quot;he was fairly friendly with Beauregard on many things, but has always been a bit of a &quot;gun nut&quot; as it were... It was really his idea to form R.A.M. as an organization, though Beauregard took leadership of the organization.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he would likely feel betrayed by Beauregard?&quot; I questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's possible,&quot; Wayne Hireman responded, &quot;a lot of people seem to be abandoning R.A.M. crusade for truth and justice. The guy could have felt that Beauregard was as loyal to him as he had been to Beauregard... but I didn't associate with him too much, and most of it was to briefly give him his assignment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're certain that these two men are the likely persons to have murdered Marksman?&quot; Officer Jenkins questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're the only two I can think of,&quot; Wayne Hireman answered, &quot;Some of the other ranchers that joined before I did might have a better clue as to who else could have done it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Officer Jenkins answered, &quot;Thank you for your assistance. We'll contact you if anything further comes up that you could help us with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When it comes to trying to protect and preserve R.A.M., I am always willing to help,&quot; Wayne Hireman replied.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well aside from you and the superintendent nearly going at it, I'd say that went fairly well,&quot; Officer Jenkins commented as we made our way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;People like him get to me... to be so blatantly...&quot; I began to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Officer Jenkins answered, &quot;the guy's a jerk, but since we have no warrant, he is essentially allowed to say whatever he wants, and you have to grin and take it. He probably will lose the election for clinging so much to Beauregard's defunct little group, but he can still get you fired if he files a formal complaint that you went beyond your bounds... and he DOES know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only sighed in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think he'll file it because we're investigating the murder of a R.A.M. member,&quot; Officer Jenkins warned, &quot;but believe you me, I'm sure that his &quot;wheels&quot; are turning when it comes to that idea.&quot;</p>
