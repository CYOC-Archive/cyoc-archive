<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa woke up slowly, stirring to a state where dream and thought co-exist and the physical world feels distant.  She could feel her boyfriend Eric sleeping under her, his chest pressing against her breasts.  Despite her stupor-like state, she could feel a profound horniness.  Probably due to that crazy dream last night where she had dreamt she had become three incredibly well endowed and many limbed humantaurs.<br />
<br />
It had been a crazy dream, but one she absolutely loved.  Her favorite part was having sex with Eric with 1 body, while her 2 other bodies looked on and pleasured herselves.  But that hadn&#39;t been the most intense sexual experience - that had been later in the dream when 2 of her had made love to herselves on Eric&#39;s bed.  But simultaneously having sex with her boyfriend and watching herself do it had been much more erotic.  <br />
<br />
<i>If only that could be real...</i> she thought.<br />
<br />
An itch on her posterior slowly gnawed into her nearly asleep consciousness.  She reached back and scratched at it while also wrapping her arms around Eric.  Too sleepy to squeeze tightly, her embrace relaxed as the itch subsided.  Satisfied, she let her arm slide down off the couch to a rest, barely touching the floor.<br />
<br />
Cuddling early in the morning was something she almost never got to do - Normally her parents would object to her spending the night at Eric&#39;s.  Eric&#39;s mom didn&#39;t seem to mind - she genuinely liked Lisa, and thought they were a good match.  A couple of times, Eric&#39;s mom offered Lisa the spare room if she wanted to spend the night.  The room that connected to the other side of Eric&#39;s private bathroom...<br />
<br />
<br />
The longer Lisa lay there, barely awake, the more horny she became.  The pressure on her breasts simply seemed to grow and grow, and that aroused her.  Sleepily she shifted to the side, not loosening her embrace on Eric, just rotating it.  As she shifted, she wrapped her arms around Eric&#39;s waist and held him from the back. <br />
<br />
She relaxed and waited with her eyes closed for the pressure to diminish so she could return to sleep.  A part of the pressure felt diminished, but most of it continued to build.  Lisa ignored it as long as she could, but something about it was preventing her from resting peacefully.<br />
<br />
Without breaking her cuddle-hold on Eric, Lisa used her hands to wipe the sleep from her eyes and stretch.  A loud yawn escaped her lips, and she stretched.  As she stretched, she felt her hands hit the coffee table, the back of the couch, and the floor.<br />
<br />
Finally awake enough to open her eyes, Lisa did just that.  As she had expected, she saw Eric in front of her, still asleep.  That wasn&#39;t all she saw though - Wrapped around Eric&#39;s chest she could see her 2 arms.  She could also see 2 more of her arms stretching up into the air.  And another 2 that she had just wiped her eyes with.  And even another 2 wrapped around Eric&#39;s waist.<br />
<br />
<i>It... wasn&#39;t a dream?</i><br />
<br />
The prospect woke Lisa faster than any coffee ever had.  She released her cuddle-hold on Eric as quickly as she dared, without risking waking him.  At the same time she tried to touch her boobs with her other arms - the ones that weren&#39;t on her front torso.  The ones she had seen in the dream when one of her body&#39;s had watched another body.<br />
<br />
To her amazement and delight, not only did she feel movement, but she also felt hands touch her boobs.  First one boob, then two, then three, then four, then eight, then eleven, then fourteen.  That was enough confirmation for Lisa, she didn&#39;t need to touch every single boob to prove it.  <br />
<br />
<i>IT WAS REAL!!</i><br />
<br />
Lisa stopped touching herself and moved to get up off the sofa as quickly as she could without disturbing Eric.  Reaching past Eric, she pushed her front torso up onto 4 arms, then shifted her weight past Eric, and off the couch.  She quickly lost balance and started to fall down off the sofa to the floor.<br />
<br />
She fell slowly in an almost controlled manner as her taur segments resting on the couch provided a counterweight to her now overhanging torso.  But that only lasted for a couple of seconds.  The downward weight of her torso caused her taur segments to start to slip off the couch.<br />
<br />
As she slipped off the couch, her many breasts rubbed against the leather in an almost painful, almost pleasurable way.  Lisa&#39;s torso hit the ground.  Not hard or painfully - it was a light landing.  Then her first pair of legs hit the ground.  Then the first taur segment behind her legs impacted harder, putting pressure on all 8 breasts.<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s fall off the sofa rapidly accelerated, as she had less body on the sofa, and more body on the ground.  When her second taur segment hit the ground, it hurt enough that she winced.  Her third and final taur segment hitting the ground caused her to cry in pain and surprise as it landed with a thud, painfully squishing all 8 breasts and banging her back 2 knees on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owww.  That&#39;s gonna sting for a while.&quot;  She pushed her front torso upright and shifted her front pair of legs out from under her body and in front of her.  Having successfully assumed what could best be described as a sitting position she turned her attention to Eric, and was delighted to find she hadn&#39;t woken him up with her clumsy fall.  She would have been terribly embarrassed if he had seen her clumsy fall.<br />
<br />
Now that she was off the couch and on the ground, her attention turned to standing up.  She tried to stand up like a normal person would - by leaning forward and pushing up with her front arms to get onto her legs.  She succeeded in getting her first pair of legs on the ground, and tried to stand up... at which point the weight of her lengthened body and her 6 other legs not being positioned properly on the ground caused her to fall back down.<br />
<br />
Now aware of the challenge, she tried again.  This time she lifted herself evenly by pushing upwards with 8 sets of hands, getting all 8 feet planted firmly on the ground, then stood up.  Happy with her success, she headed upstairs towards Eric&#39;s bedroom.  The last place she remembered her other 2 bodies being were on his bed, and she wanted to confirm that not only did she still have her changed body, but she still had 3 changed bodies.<br />
<br />
<br />
The door to Eric&#39;s bedroom was closed, but unlocked.  It swoke open with only a tiny squeak, and Lisa saw lying on the bed were 2 more Lisa bodies.  Their limbs were intertwined and wrapped around each other, and their long taur segments pressed tightly together, squishing many breasts between them.  The bed itself was in desperate need of cleaning, and the 2 Lisa bodies both clearly needed a shower.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to cut short her other body&#39;s sleep, Lisa turned to go back down the stairs - Or tried to at least.  Her long body made such a turn impractical.  Pausing for a moment, she considered her options.  <br />
<br />
<i>Oh!  I can do a three point turn, like in driver&#39;s ed!</i><br />
<br />
Happy with her cleverness, Lisa did just that - She walked forward into Eric&#39;s bedroom until her butt was inside the door.  Then she walked backwards, careful to turn herself so that her butt moved down the hallway away from the stairs.  A few steps with 8 feet, and she was back in the hallway facing the other direction.<br />
<br />
<i>Wait a second... Did I really just turn myself around like an 18 wheeler?  Jeeze that&#39;s... Kinda weird.  But also awesome, cause I have eiiiight legs!</i><br />
<br />
Downstairs she checked that Eric was still asleep.  A low rumble from her stomach, followed by low rumbles from her taur segments told her 2 things: First, she must have multiple stomachs.  Second, it was time for breakfast.  <br />
<br />
In the kitchen she spotted an apron and put it on her torso, protecting her otherwise naked front.  The apron barely fit: her 8 breasts strained against the fabric.  A quick search of the fridge revealed two dozen eggs and a side of bacon.  In no time, she had eggs and bacon cooking up.<br />
<br />
A sudden touch on Lisa&#39;s ass startled her, almost causing her to knock the pan off the stove.  She tried to spin around to see whoever touched her, but only succeeded in rotating her front legs and torso about 60 degrees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaah!  Who&#39;s that?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
About 10 feet behind her head, Eric spoke: &quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to startle you.  What&#39;s cooking, sexy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eggs and bacon!  Should be ready in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.  I&#39;ll get some plates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric squeezed past Lisa and quickly set the table.  He approached her front by the side with a pair of dishes in hand.  She took both plates from Eric, gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, and used two spatulas to put the breakfast onto the plates all at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  That&#39;s a crazy amount of coordination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa handed Eric one of the dishes, and walked backward while holding her dish.  &quot;It feels surprisingly natural.  Well most of it.  Some things, like standing up, are a little harder.  But still manageable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric sat down at the table, and amusedly watched Lisa shift around until she was standing on the opposite side of the table. Once there, she pondered the chair in front of her briefly before turning it sideways and plopping down her front torso on it.  Her front 2 legs sat on the chair, with her front torso upright.  Her taur segments and other 6 legs remained standing, keeping her upright and stable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this is weird.  I&#39;m... sitting and standing at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t be any weirder than what you were doing last night.&quot;  Eric winked and took a bite off a strip of bacon.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing.  I didn&#39;t know it was possible to experience anything like that.&quot;  Lisa dug into her breakfast, quickly discovering that despite being able to easily hold 6 serving portions in her hands, her mouth could only handle 1 at a time.<br />
<br />
Their conversation paused for a few minutes while they ate ravenously.  The previous night&#39;s activities had burned a lot of calories, and now they were feeling it.  On finishing his breakfast, Eric got up and got some more from the stove.  Lisa ate slower than Eric, but that is analogous to saying a guinea pig is slower than a jet airplane.<br />
<br />
After returning with another full plate, Eric took a quick break from inhaling the food to speak again, &quot;Thanks for cooking breakfast.  I think that&#39;s supposed to be my job though, seeing we&#39;re at my house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah!  That&#39;s what you get for sleeping in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric put down his fork and looked slyly in Lisa&#39;s direction, &quot;I should sleep in more often... When you sleep over&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa grinned at the implication.  &quot;Next time we&#39;re sleeping in your room.  I don&#39;t want to sleep on the sofa again, it&#39;s too short.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged, &quot;Well, it won&#39;t be too short when you revert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, should be around noon.  I put a time limit on the change.  16 hours.&quot;</p>
