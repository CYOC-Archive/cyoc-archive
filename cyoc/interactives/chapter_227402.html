<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Look at this place,&quot; The Boss sighed. &quot;Hard to believe in about 80 years I&#39;ll be calling this place home.&quot; Casseus simply nodded as the pair journeyed deeper into the caves of this secluded Pacific island 200 miles off the coast of California.<br />
<br />
Casseus was at first confused about what the Boss meant by resurrecting his old boss. Villar had been destroyed, his essence regaining strength within a soul gem. That gem though was currently in possession of Fukushu, kept safe within his sanctum. To even attempt to acquire that gem would be suicide. Or so Casseus thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was surprisingly easy,&quot; the Boss stated as they traveled further. &quot;The Catalysts furry buddy has been so busy with fatherhood and his own family that he let his defenses down. Remember how you were able to gain access to it in the future? I used the same spell and Blackbird snuck in. She replaced it with a phony of course, and got out as quickly as she could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite impressive Boss,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;However, I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;ve seemed on edge lately. Especially when it comes to Demeter.&quot; The Boss now went oddly silent. They had reached their destination, the sacred sanctum hidden beneath the island. Casseus expected the Boss to have a quip, a grand statement about his success, instead he simply sighed. &quot;Shes family,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Not by choice, more like a foster parent...and a royal pain in my ass.&quot; Casseus said nothing, shocked by the Boss’s utterance. He had no idea the Boss even had family. &quot;Then again though,&quot; he continued. &quot;You would know all about family you&#39;re not fond of. Right Dustin?&#39;<br />
<br />
Casseus balked. He hadn&#39;t heard anyone call him by that name in years perhaps decades. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;You think I didn&#39;t do my research before I resurrected you. You think I didn&#39;t know Villar was your foster brother Ty? How he lived with your family until his powers manifested when he turned 15? How you, his brother Dustin, would eventually join him? Gaining the power you have now, becoming so much more than human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you learn this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t easy,&quot; the Boss shrugged. &quot;I had to dig deep but you look hard enough you find a paper trail and imagine my surprise when I find out Villar was the son of Jack Martin and Kellie Pendragon. Sent to another universe with no ties to this one. Raised in a world where his magic made him a God. Where he could do anything, change anything. No one, not even you knew where Ty&#39;s power came from. It wouldn&#39;t be until you two conquered that universe that you realized it was magic. Which then brought you here. By the way, what were your parents names again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark and June.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; the Boss nodded. &quot;Man, can you imagine the looks on their faces if they could see you now? One of the most powerful dark wizards in existence with a genius level intellect  and a foster brother who at this point is a cosmic being. They would be astounded. Or not, I know they could be dicks.&quot; Casseus simply nodded, he wasn&#39;t sure if he liked the Boss reminding him of the human he used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway enough family talk,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;Lets get the show on the road.&quot; Casseus now stood back as the Boss placed the soul gem in the middle of the cave floor. Years from now, this hidden sanctum would be well maintained by the Normal, the Boss tapping into its power to assist in his necromancy. Now, the sanctum was simply a dirt floor with ancient mystic markings engraved on the walls. The Boss now began to chant, Casseus watching as a purple light now began to flicker within the gem itself. <br />
<br />
It happened so quickly that Casseus was taken by surprise. One moment the gem was glowing a brilliant purple, the next moment a massive humanoid lay on the floor, grunting and trying to catch his breath. Casseus now approached cautiously, gazing down at his former master. &quot;Lord Villar?&quot;<br />
<br />
Villar did not answer, continuing to grunt. &quot;Lord Villar it&#39;s me Casseus.&quot; Still no answer, Villars pale skin and dark hair seemingly lined with sweat. Casseus wasn&#39;t sure if his former master could hear him. &quot;Ty it&#39;s me Dustin. Wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the mention of his former name, Villars eyes flew open. Two pools of inky darkness now glared angrily at Casseus. &quot;Casseus,&quot; he voice deep and otherworldly. &quot;Where am I.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there he is,&quot; the Boss exclaimed happily. Approaching he now watched as the nude titan slowly stood. &quot;Wow you&#39;re a big one,&quot; the Boss said in awe. &quot;You gotta be what, 8 feet tall? 600 lbs of solid muscle. By the way huge fan. You really gave the wizards a run for their money, &quot; The Boss now reached up, grabbing Villars massive pecs and squeezing. &quot;Damn,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Like trying to squeeze a steel girder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you,&quot; Villar growled, his dark eyes narrowing. &quot;Oh where are my manners,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;I&#39;m the Boss. I resurrected you. You work for me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Villar raised an eyebrow, staring down at the average sized man in his robes. Despite this man&#39;s face being obscured, Villar could almost see his wide smile. &quot;I am a God puny mortal,&quot; he stated. &quot;No one commands the conqueror of timelines.:<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see why you would say that,&quot; the Boss replied, his tenor sounding more like a customer service representative. &quot;But no. See when it comes to the big bads around here I&#39;m number one.&quot; Villar said nothing, Casseus watching with interest as Villar and the Boss stared at one another. Without another word, Villar now backhanded the Boss, sending the man crashing into a cave wall. Casseus winced, listening to the sick thud the body made. Just from the sound alone, Casseus believed the Boss’s bones had been reduced to dust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casseus,&quot; Villar stated. &quot;Gather our troops. It is time to show these wizards that I cannot be bested.&quot; A groan now emanated from the direction the Boss flew, Villar watched, unmoved, as the Boss got to his feet. &quot;Nice shot,&quot; he grunted, trying to stretch his back. &quot;Now I know why that girl Catalyst feared you. Immeasurable strength and...what did you call those things that made up your army?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Voids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Voids,&quot; the Boss grunted. &quot;Soulless husks of the bodies from every universe you conquered.&quot; Villar was speechless, scowling at the Boss as the man slowly approached. How was he still alive? The blow Villar delivered would have destroyed even the most powerful of beings. Now, this man was stretching as if he had fallen asleep on an uncomfortable couch. &quot;Everyone gets one,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;But we need to establish the pecking order.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus now watched as green lightning arced from the Boss’s hands, enveloping the titan. Villar grunted, his face screwing up in pain as smoke began to lift from his body. &quot;Wow you are impressive,&quot; the Boss said in awe. &quot;That amount of power should have knocked you on your ass. Guess I gotta up the voltage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cracking his knuckles, the Boss now let loose with another torrent of green lightning. Villar growled, the titan clenching his fists as he squeezed his eyes shut in pain. After what seemed like an eternity, Villar collapsed to his knees, his breathing ragged. &quot;There,&quot; the Boss sighed in relief. &quot;Whew that was harder than I thought. I can&#39;t wait to get to work. But first.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wave of his hand, the naked titan now found himself clothed in black. Laceless boots, relaxed fit pants, and a collar less long sleeved shirt with the Normals symbol emblazoned on the right side of his chest. &quot;So we good,&quot; the Boss asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now,&quot; Villar growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; the Boss replied. &quot;And that&#39;s why I&#39;m...the Boss. Now down to business.&quot; With a wave of his hand, the Biss now conjured a picture showing Villar a group of people he was all too familiar with.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you remember Circes Park,&quot; the Boss said. &quot;And Kellie Pendragon and her daughter Annie. What do you say, you want to finish what you started?&quot;</p>
