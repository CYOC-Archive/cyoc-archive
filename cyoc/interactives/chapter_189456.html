<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Merging?&quot;, your repeated wide-eyed, &quot;Like Fusion? You joking?&quot;<br />
Phil laughed. &quot;You just saw me earlier, didn앖 you?&quot;<br />
&quot;But that was ... with this machine there ... the giant micro wave ... And we are talking about Crests here, these little medals.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; And with that, Phil took out some kind of orange lens, holding it between thumb and index finger. &quot;As you know, this big machine, it압 not for merging in the first place. On top of that, it is built with humans in mind, not just BeastMon. Pure BeastMon-Teleportation or even Merging is way easier than anything of this with humans involved. Change and Transformation lies in their DNA, and we can trigger it with the right tools.&quot;<br />
&quot;Woah ... sounds awesome!&quot;, you said. &quot;But, a little mean, too. Do BeastMon like that kind of thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Good question.&quot; Now Phil smiled kindly at you. &quot;Some sorts of BeastMon even evolve through merging. But at last it might just be an individual question if they like it or not. These Crest, by the way, can also separate Beasties, so no fear. It압 not permanent, as far as you don앖 want it to be.&quot;<br />
&quot;I would never force something like that!&quot;, you promptly responded. Not permanently. Just for a joke, so to speak ...<br />
&quot;And in my opinion, this makes you a qualified wielder of this power. - Sadly you need to beat the third Arena Boss, Sergeant Striker, in Marigold City to have it.&quot;<br />
Your hand was already open, for you had hoped Phil would just drop the Crest into it. &quot;Oh&quot;, you said, feeling embarrassed and lowering your hand. Just as he practically shoved the Crest at you.<br />
&quot;Come on, let압 show, don앖 tell!&quot; He led you from the table down to the beach, where your and Phil압 BeastMon were still fighting. Not in a real Brawl, they didn앖 even used Moves or balled fists. They were just pushing and grappling each other. The pink magical girl and the sheep hung onto Annie압 legs while the lizard-girl herself had Racer in a choke-hold.<br />
 Phil lowered his voice, so the Beasties couldn앖 hear him. &quot;Use the lens together with the Cube압 laser to select one of your Beasties, then to the same for the other. If they would have more then two Types after that, one Type would disappear. You can even select that, thanks to your Pager.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh&quot;, you said, gulping. &quot;So, it압 a strategical decision. No problem, no problem ...&quot; It was absolutely a problem. You felt the dire need to debate this with Annie first, the true Gamer here. But what could you say? Oh, I will need my Heatdraka for a short debate about Trainering! Please wait a moment! No, you would not say that.<br />
By this, Phil laughed softly. <br />
&quot;What?&quot;, you snarled.<br />
&quot;You kid-trainers are so adorable, ruminating over everything. - You know what, I will allow you this Crest for two uses, plus the separation. So you can do one for the fun, and the second might be your Ace, if Molly shows herself too powerful for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I never said, I would need something like this against Molly&quot;, you responded sternly. &quot;If I앐 not supposed to have this kind of power, I will not need it.&quot;<br />
Of course, that didn앖 mean you won앖 try it right now.<br />
You now reached the little punch-up.<br />
&quot;Hey, Annie?&quot;, you shouted, &quot;Bullying the little ones again?&quot;<br />
Annie sent you a short gaze. &quot;Just demonstrating my dominance&quot;, she simpered, choosing this moment to tickle Racer, who bursted out in laughter, getting attacked at her weakpoint.<br />
You snickered at that. &quot;Okay. Belle? Come over here.&quot;<br />
&quot;You too, Jigg&quot;, Phil called his Jigpie to his side. The two BeastChildren jumped away from Annie and Racer, rushing over to you. &quot;You know, Lucy? My Jigpie is quit good at sorting out violence.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
&quot;Like this. Jigg, how about a Heartpulse?&quot; On command, the wand in Jigpie압 hands began to glow.<br />
Annie pricked her ears at that. &quot;Wait, what -&quot;<br />
&quot;Jiiiiig-pie!&quot; The Beastie stabbed in their direction, bathing both Annie and Racer in soft, pink light. They slowed down in their grappling. Racer turned her head at Annie. <br />
&quot;Uh ... what just happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;She charmed us, you birdbrain&quot;, Annie snarled at her. &quot;And now we ... were your eyes always this green?&quot; Instead of choking her, Annie instead caressed Racers cheek. &quot;And was your skin always this soft?&quot;<br />
&quot;I ... I don앖 know? Could never saw my eyes for myself&quot;, Racer responded, &quot;Oh, but I can see myself right now, in your own eyes ... so pretty blue like one of the puddles on Route One ...&quot;<br />
Annie blinked furiously at that, she almost broke the spell hearing this crude metaphor.<br />
Phil nudged you. &quot;Now try it.&quot;<br />
Indeed, your targets were right now pretty much stuck. You took Annie압 Cube first, firing the laser at her. By passing through the lens, it changed from blue to a more orange color. Annie was hit, an equally orange glow encasing her body. She frowned at that. &quot;Lucas?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just a little experiment&quot;, you said, changing the Cubes and now firing at Racer. &quot;All is fine!&quot;<br />
In front of you, both your Beasties glowed with soft light. They looked at each other, sceptical. Annie loosened her choke-hold, but noticed, she really couldn앖. <br />
&quot;What is this now?&quot; Her arms were glued in place, her hand on Racer압 cheek came free only after an energetic pull. &quot;Why are you so sticky all of the sudden, Birdie!&quot;<br />
&quot;Uuuh ... I don앖 know?&quot; Racer was still under the little charm, not as worried about the ordeal. &quot;It just so happens, right?&quot;<br />
Annie huffed at that, trying to get away but failing. They were entangled with each other, and there was something like a magnetic force, pulling them even tighter. Her eyes grew wide as she saw one of her arms sank into Racer압 shoulder, right through the clothing.<br />
As for the clothes, the fabric dissolved already, forming something entirely new. Annie fought back by putting her foot against Racer압 hip, only to slide off and sank into her thigh! <br />
At this point, they were an entanglement of body parts, slowly becoming lesser in numbers. From the hips downwards, the two BeastGirls were now one person, with Annies upper body somewhat sticking out of Racer압 stomach. And the force pulled further. Their chests now pushed together, faces almost meshing into each other. Annie recoiled one last time, whereas Racer just looked at the mess with curiosity.<br />
You stepped a little forward. &quot;So ... how does it feel?&quot;<br />
Annie turned her face at you, with a death glare. &quot;You are brave to ask. This is uncomfortable as hell!&quot;<br />
&quot;It could be worse&quot;, Racer murmured.<br />
By that, Annie압 face snapped at her to respond, but their faces collided and merged straight into each other. By that, the changes accelerated, pulling both BeastGirls together and creating a whole new form out of them. Their clothes followed in the same way, intertwining and becoming something new.<br />
Were two girls had wrestled, now stood only one. Her blonde and auburn hair quickly settled into an unified colour, a soft brown tone, like amber. It was bound in a pony tail, with small feathers dangling from the hair band. She looked at you, one eye blue and the other one green, her delicate features a mix of both Annie and Racer. At first there was anger showing, but soon enough she examined herself.<br />
&quot;Not gonna lie&quot;, she said finally, &quot;this is ... interesting.&quot;<br />
The BeastGirl wore Racer압 pilot uniform, but with flaming red scales at shoulders and sleeves, while she still wore Annie압 jeans and boots. Behind her, the Heatdraka압 tail swished from side to side, almost unchanged.</p>
