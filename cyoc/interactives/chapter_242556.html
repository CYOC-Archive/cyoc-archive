<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zac stood at the edge of the street, staring up at the massive stone mansion that loomed before him like a fortress. Ivy Hall, home to the most prestigious fraternity on campus, Kappa Omega Sigma, was known for its career-making connections and legendary parties. The mansion’s grand pillars and ancient Greek letters seemed to glint with a sense of untouchable power. <br />
<br />
Clutching the invitation in his hand, Zac felt his nerves kick in. Freshman year had just begun, but everyone knew that getting into Kappa Omega Sigma was the golden ticket. He tightened the cord of his dressing gown, the only thing he was allowed to wear tonight, as per the initiation dress code. Barely covering his nerves—and much else—Zac was determined to make a solid first impression despite the humiliating attire. It was all part of the fraternity&#39;s tradition, and he knew every other initiate would be in the same boat.<br />
<br />
The front door creaked open, letting out a wave of laughter, music, and the smell of booze. Inside, the house was more impressive than Zac had imagined—dim lighting cast shadows across the walls, with old brass sconces and a simple iron chandelier dangling from the vaulted ceiling. Guys in jeans and polos or casual button-ups gathered around, talking and laughing by the grand staircase. Zac could feel the bass from the music thumping through the floor as he made his way inside, his heart pounding just as fast.<br />
<br />
As he made his way into the hall, Zac heard his name being called.<br />
“Zac! Over here, bro!” It was Jordan, his buddy from high school and now a sophomore, casually leaning against the banister like he owned the place. Jordan was already a member of Kappa Omega Sigma, and if there was one thing Zac had learned, it was that Jordan had the inside track on everything cool.<br />
Zac felt a wave of relief at the sight of his friend, who greeted him with a fist bump and a knowing grin. “Nervous?”<br />
“Not at all,” Zac lied.<br />
Jordan chuckled, slinging an arm around his shoulders and guiding him deeper into the house. “Well you ignored all my warnings on how serious these guys get with the hazing, but you’re here now. Just stick with me, and you’ll do fine. Welcome to the party.”<br />
“Thanks man, you know how much I need this. Besides, you went through it all last year, how bad can it be?”<br />
Jordan shook  his head in amusement. “A freshman’s famous last words right there.”<br />
Jordan led Zac down the long hallway. As they passed, the other brothers turned to watch, their eyes sizing Zac up like a pack of wolves eyeing fresh prey. Their conversations couldn’t be heard over the loud music, but some exchanged smirks, clearly amused by the sight of another naked freshman in the fraternity’s infamous dressing gown. <br />
<br />
The next room Zac entered was small and mostly bare. A bunch of couches and tables littered the area. Seemingly a good place for a small group to chill and hang out. A rack of hooks lined one wall, each holding a dressing gown identical to his. The room felt oddly quiet compared to the noise spilling in from the other doorway, which led to the kitchen. Through the doorway, Zac could see fraternity members casually drinking and chatting, their laughter echoing back into the otherwise empty space. <br />
Before he could enter further, he found himself staring at a strange standing lamp in the corner of the room. As Zac’s eyes adjusted to the dim light, he realized the lamp wasn’t a typical fixture—it was an eerily realistic statue. The figure was of a naked guy, incredibly lifelike, with every muscle and contour of his toned body rendered in startling detail. His skin looked almost real, with faint veins running across his broad chest and arms, and his abs were defined with precision that made Zac second-guess whether it was truly just a statue.  In typical frat boy humor the cock was sporting a massive erection, obnoxiously protruding outward. Circumcised and probably about six or seven inches. The whole thing seemed disturbingly lifelike, as if it could move at any moment, but where the man’s head should have been, there was only a light bulb socket, with a lampshade balanced on top.<br />
<br />
“Woah, what’s the story here?” Zac asked.<br />
“Oh that’s Trevor.” Jordan said nonchalantly, “a member who was part of the hazing with me last year.”<br />
Even more confused, Zac walked up to the lamp to inspect it. The sculpture felt like real skin to the touch, and even appeared to grow goosebumps as Zac stroked his fingers along one of the arms.<br />
“What do you mean this is Trevor?” He asked, peering under the lampshade to confirm this was not just a prank. “He has no head, just a light bulb fixture!” <br />
<br />
Glancing behind the body, Zac’s gaze found a black cord plugged into an outlet in the wall. The cord led straight to the statue, and as his eyes travelled up, he realized, with a mix of disbelief and amusement, that it was connected to the statue’s back—specifically, emerging from its arse.<br />
<br />
“He lost his body privileges last year, hopefully this year he should get them back” <br />
As Jordan explained, he pointed out the rest of Trevor in the crowd in the next room. Zac could see a few guys chatting, and one holding the head of another like someone would a basketball. Just a head! The head of Trevor, light brown hair and the same skin tone as the lamp, was chatting away with the rest of them like nothing was amiss. He even took a swig of beer with the help of his mate holding him.<br />
<br />
“That is insane, how is that even possible?” <br />
Jordan shrugged, “This frat tries out a lot of experimental stuff that they&#39;ve ‘borrowed’ from the college on the pledges. To be honest this isn&#39;t the weirdest stuff.”<br />
Almost to demonstrate that he wasn&#39;t talking complete BS, Jordan pulled down the erect cock like a lever for it to spring back up as he let it go. In an immediate response, the head, Trevor, looked over in the direction of his body and stared daggers at Jordan, clearly feeling Jordan&#39;s tug.<br />
<br />
“I warned you, last chance to back out.” Jordan said.<br />
“You didn&#39;t tell me someone had their head removed!” Zac retorted.<br />
“Had his body removed technically. And you wouldn&#39;t have believed me if I did! <br />
“How is he still alive?”<br />
“There&#39;s a disk implanted at each end of the split that supplements what he needs, oxygen, blood etcetera etcetera- look I don&#39;t know the details, I&#39;m a business major not one of the science guys here. All I know is he&#39;s adapted to living as just a head quite well, grades were barely affected can you believe it. And the frat gets this sexy lamp.” Jordan smacks the headless body&#39;s butt for emphasis. Immediately Trevor calls out for him to quit it.<br />
<br />
“He&#39;s fine. It&#39;s all part of the fun of hazing the newbies. Which means you gotta make a choice…” Jordan leaned in close to Zac, still grinning, pointed at the rack of dressing gowns. “...are you gonna try to join or not?”<br />
Zac’s stomach tightened, but he knew he couldn’t back out now. If he became a member he&#39;ll be set for life, but what if he ended up like Trevor?<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, he untied the knot and let the gown slip off his shoulders, the cool air hitting his skin. As he hung it on the rack with the others, a wave of awkwardness washed over him. Standing there fully exposed in front of Jordan—his buddy from high school—felt unsettling in a way he hadn’t anticipated. Despite their years of friendship, they&#39;ve never been naked in front of each other. <br />
<br />
He quickly glanced at Jordan, expecting a smirk or teasing remark, but Jordan just clapped him on the back, casual as ever. “Welcome to the next step, bro. Time to meet the fraternity.” <br />
Zac nodded, trying to hide as much of his cock behind his hands as possible without making it too obvious.</p>
