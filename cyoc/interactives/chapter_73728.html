<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One the way back home, he heard a familiar voice.  “Hi Bobby!  Over here!”  Turning his head, he saw two women in their thirties.  Looking at them, he soon realized who they were.  They were Jessica Monroe and Alice Anderson, wives and mothers of wonder family.  They were neighbors of his mother and great people.  They always tend to visit the house almost everyday and took the kids with him.  Jessica has a 4-year-old son named Jonathan Monroe and Alice has a 3-year-old daughter named Mary Anderson.  Great kids with a lot of energy and full of fun.<br />
<br />
The two approached Bobby and started to talk.  “Hello there Bobby.” Jessica said, “How are you today.”  Bobby smirked and said, “Doing good Ms. Monroe.  Just bought a ring at this store.  Something about it being magical.  Though I highly doubt it.”  The two women looked at him and gave a little laugh about it.  “That’s nice.” said Alice, “Listen, we need to ask for a simple favor for you.  See Jessica and I are going to a spa for a few days just to relax from all the stresses at home.  And since our husbands are on separate business trips and we are worried about the daycare centers around here, we need to find a babysitter to take care of our kids.  So we were thinking if we could ask for you to baby-sit them.”<br />
<br />
Bobby looked at the two and was surprised by that.  They want him to baby-sit the kids?  Sure he likes to hang out with the kids, but never thought that he would take care of them for a few days.  But then he had an occurring idea.  If the ring he has in his possession is magical and can change an age of the person they would pick, then maybe he might have a chance in testing it out of the kids.  And when the mother’s come back, he would return them back to their original state.  So he looked at the women and said, “Sure Ms. Anderson, I’ll take care of the kids.  I mean it’s not like they are in diapers or anything.”  The two women looked at each other were happy that they accepted their offer.  “That’s perfect!” both of them said.  That’s when Jessica came in and said, “We’ll let the kids know that you would be babysitting them.  They will be so thrilled!  We’ll be leaving tomorrow, so we’ll drop off the kids in the morning before our flight leaves.  Okay?”  Bobby nodded and said, “Sure.  I’ll see you two tomorrow morning.”  The two women nodded and left the area.  But Bobby only thought about what would she do with the two kids.  Walking back to his house, he couldn’t wait for tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The next day, he was waiting for the mothers to come with the children.  He barely had enough sleep since he talked to the mothers and was anxious about it.  Looking at the ring on his finger, he was wondered what he would do to them.  Turned them into teens?  Grown them into adults?  Make them elderly?  Make one younger while the other was older?  The possibilities are endless.<br />
<br />
Just as he was thinking about what he would be doing, he heard the ring at the doorbell.  Since his mother left for the hospital early and his dad was at work, he’s the only person left in the house.  Rushing to the door, he turned the knob and opened it to reveal Jessica and Alice waiting for him.  They were wearing summer clothes with sunglasses and straw hats as if they were ready to go to the spa.  They all had smiles on their faces as Alice said, “Hi there Bobby!  You’re the only one at home?”  Bobby smiled and said, “Yes, I’m afraid so.  Mom already left to the hospital to take care of the patients and dad had a business meeting.  So I’m the only one in charge of the house.”  That’s when he heard two young voices below him.  “Hi Bobby!!!”  Looking down, he saw the two kids that the mother’s raised so well.<br />
<br />
The first one is Jonathan Monroe, the son of Jessica Monroe.  At four years of age, he was always an ambitious kid.  Dreams of becoming of doctor when he grows up too.  He had messy brown hair just like his father and dark blue eyes just like his mother.  He was wearing a green T-Shirt with Baby Looney Tunes on the front, blue jean shorts for his age, and a pair kiddie Nike sneakers.  The second child is 3-year-old Mary Anderson.  As a toddler, she has so much energy; she didn’t know what to do with it.  Her mother thought that she could be a dancer when she grows up since she likes to dance to the music.  She had her mother’s blond hair that is done up in pigtails and aqua blue eyes that resembled that of her father.  She was wearing a pink T-shirt with Dora the Explora on the front, a childish skit over her training pants, and a pair of Dora slip-ons.<br />
<br />
The two kids looked right at him and had wide smiles on their faces.  Bobby looked down at them and scooped them up to give them a big hug.  “Hi there Johnny!  Mary!” he then said, “Are you two ready to have fun with your favorite neighbor?”  The two children looked at him and nodded with total glee.  Alice then came in and said, “Again Bobby, we would like to thank you for taking care of the kids while we are at the spa for a few days.  We’re real grateful that you take the time to take care of them.”  Bobby gave off a sly smile and responded in the most innocent way possible.  “Oh don’t be,” he said, “you know I would take good of them.”  The women nodded as they placed the bags and languages for their kids in the house, completely unaware that Bobby has other intentions in his head.<br />
<br />
The mothers then looked at their children and talked to heir kids.  “Now John,” Jessica started to say, “I want you to be on your best behavior with Bobby.  I don’t want you to cause too much trouble for him.  Do you understand?”  Johnny nodded and said, “Yes mommy.  I’ll be good.”  “You too Mary.” Alice then said to her daughter, “Be a nice girl and I’ll get you that doll you always wanted.”  Mary smiled widely and wanted to get that doll at the toy store.  She nodded and said, “Kay mommy!”<br />
<br />
Once they told to the kids, they looked at Bobby and told him some things.  Jessica started by saying, “Now, the supplies, food, and toys are in their luggage’s and bags that will last for a few days.  They get fed for 10 A.M at breakfast, 1:00 P.M. at lunch, and 5:00 P.M. at dinner.  They then need to go to sleep at around 8:00 – 8:30 P.M.”  “Our phone numbers are in the bad as well.” Alice continued, “If there’s anything you want to talk about or any help you need, just give us a call.  And please Bobby, whatever you do, don’t lose them.  The last thing we want is our kids to get lost around the neighborhood.”  Bobby nodded and said, “Don’t you worry.  I’ll keep them busy and not let them get into any trouble.”<br />
<br />
With that said, they waved to Bobby and the kids and were leaving.  “Bye kids!  We’ll see you in a few days!”  The kids waved to their mother and said their farewells as well.  Once they leave, Bobby closed the door and placed the kids on the floor.  Looking at them, he said to them, “Well, we’re the only ones in the house.  What do you two want to do?”  The two looked at each other as Johnny said, “I want to play doctor!  Do you want to be my patient Mary?”  Mary looked at her friend and said, “Uh-huh.  I wike to pway doctor!”  The two rushed into the living room and were about to play doctor.  Bobby looked at it and realized that he got the opportunity he needed.  Looking at the ring, he smiled and said, “Now, how will I age them to…”</p>
