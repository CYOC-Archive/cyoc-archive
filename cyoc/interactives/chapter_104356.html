<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the change complete and the message appearing on the bottom, Michelle figured she could do just that - share the joy. Scanning the classroom, her eyes stopped on Belle. She never really sad anything, seemed to need a bit of a confidence boost. Perhaps this note could help? As the teacher wasn&#39;t looking, she tossed the note to the girl.<br />
<br />
Belle was too occupied to notice the note flying right at her face, at least not until it was too late. At first, she just looked at it, and then at everyone else in class - wondering who threw it. ...But, nobody gave any hints. With a sigh, she unwrapped the note, only to a little bit of text at the top.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re not happy with who you are, are you? Here&#39;s a game to make a change in your life. Have fun! I know I did!&quot; Was written, and moments later, somehow, as if noticing her confusion, more text appeared beneath. &quot;Just answer these simple questions, be honest, and have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Questions?&quot; She thought to herself. Not only was the fact that text randomly appeared more than a little odd, but how it seemingly responded to her confusion only made things stranger.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 1:  If you were a guy... would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
For several seconds, she just stared at the question. Was she suppose to write her answer down. As nothing else happened, she picked up a pen and began to write.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be a complete and utter mess... Almost impossible to understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wrote down jokingly. The boredom of the teacher&#39;s droning was getting to her.<br />
But, what she did not realize, was that her subconscious was edited so that her writing was just as she described.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 2: If you were a guy... what would your favorite color be?<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be...&quot; She stopped writing for a moment. Something about her writing seemed...off, but she couldn&#39;t put her finger on why. She shrugged the feeling off. &quot;...I would be a big fan of red, green and black.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she finished writing, not much happened on the outside, though her color preferences did change despite her not noticing it.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 3: If you were a guy... would your hair be straight or curvy?<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be straight.&quot; She answered simply, and, as she did so, her previously wavy hair straightened out. Neither her or her classmates even noticed it.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 4: If you were a guy... what color would your hair be?<br />
<br />
Well, she had always liked redheads... But black hair was also pretty cool. Maybe something a bit more out there? ...Green, perhaps?<br />
<br />
&quot;My hair would be dark red.&quot; She finally decided, scribbling it down in messy swirls. There was a mild itch in her scalp as her light brown hair&#39;s color shifted to the dark red she had written down.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 5: If you were a guy... What color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
This time around, she felt to be...unique. Something interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;They would be red. Not over-the-top, just a dim red.&quot; And so, the note, through one way or another, warped her green eyes into a red color.<br />
<br />
She yawned, realizing that class was more or less over, and everyone around her was packing up their things. Quickly, she did the same, hastily stuffing the note into her pocket before making her way out of the classroom before anyone else - before somebody may decide to talk to her.<br />
<br />
Finding a comfortable spot to sit in the cafeteria - where she usually got to be for herself, she took the note back out and continued.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 6: If you were a guy... would you like working out?<br />
<br />
Well, she did like muscular guys, so that question was easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, very ripped. It would be more or less a hobby.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gasped, a surge of energy passed through her, causing all of her muscles to ache and pulse, their mass expanding exponentially on her originally petite frame until it looked as if she had been working out for years now, her school uniform clinging tightly on her muscular frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what...?&quot; She muttered out loud, but the shock seemed to just...vanish. Her focus shifted back to the note.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 7: If you were a guy... would you like suits?<br />
<br />
She wouldn&#39;t say that she disliked them, but she never really found them attractive, per se.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would wear them only when necessary.&quot; She answered, leading to no changes there...but her wardrobe at home got a couple of changes as her dresses shifted into suits and tuxedos.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 8: If you were a guy... What would you wear on your upper body?<br />
<br />
After a moment of think, imagining different articles of clothing, she found herself leaning towards one in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;A snug, white t-shirt with a black leather jacket over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, her tie seemingly disappeared into thin air, and her button-up shirt took on the much more simple form of a t-shirt, the sleeves rolling up and the buttons fading away. the beige, v-neck vest she had on, on the other hand, opened up and darkened into a deep, shiny black. <br />
<br />
QUESTION 9: If you were a guy... What would you wear on your lower body?<br />
<br />
Deciding to follow through with the image she had going so far, she didn&#39;t waste a lot of time to decide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tight, also black leather pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her skirt wasted no time shifting into the requested material and color, traveling down her legs as it morphed into some very tight pants.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 10: If you were a guy... Would you be manly?<br />
<br />
Another easy question for her to answer. She much preferred manly guys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course. Manly and cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she finished writing, just as with her muscles, a strange feeling surged through her face, hands and feet. Her hands and feet swelled in size, losing their feminine appearance and her face gained a much more sharp look, notable cheekbones, her jaw gaining much pronunciation and her nose grew larger.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 11: If you were a guy... what size would your equipment be?<br />
<br />
And there it was - she wondered when it would pop up. Though, in fact, it wasn&#39;t that easy to answer... She did find the idea of larger equipment much greater, but if she were to have it...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Large. It would put all other guys at school to shame.&quot; She answered with a chuckle. But that chuckle was quickly interrupted by and intense pleasure in her groin area. Her sex was pulsing like crazy, until a bulge - a large one at that - strained against her tight pants. What still was of her breasts also disappeared at this point, rendering her basically male at this point.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 12: If you were a guy... would you be into girls?<br />
<br />
The thought didn&#39;t sound all that fun to her - besides, she did enjoy her fair share of BL (Boys love) stories...<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, I would be attracted to guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
As that already was the case, not much changed - if anything at all.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 13: If you were a guy...would you shave?<br />
<br />
Hairiness, huh? She let the idea sink in before deciding on her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would shave my face, yes. But not the rest of my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, she felt several spots on her body... Crotch, armpits, chest, back, belly... All of which gaining a coat of red hair.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 14: If you were a guy... would you use cologne or hair gel?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hair gel, and quite a bit of it. I&#39;d have spiky hair, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt as if somebody was tugging at her hair, forming it into several spikes atop her head. Not only that, but the added her gel gave it an extra shiny look.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 15: If you were a guy... would you be wearing briefs, boxers, or something in-between?<br />
<br />
In all honesty, her knowledge of men&#39;s underwear was...kind of limited. But she just decided on something and hoped for the best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boxers. Black ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her, at this point, useless panties,  grew down her legs a bit, becoming more comfortable in the process as they finally managed to encapsule her large equipment.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 16: If you were a guy... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
<br />
Of course she didn&#39;t want to be dumb or anything - that would be plain, well... dumb.<br />
<br />
&quot;7. I&#39;d be fairly smart, enough to surprise people despite my appearance.&quot;<br />
<br />
She actually grew more intelligent from what, before, would count as a 5. Not that she noticed the change at that moment.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 17: If you were a guy... How popular would you be?<br />
<br />
Even with her shyness, she did wish to be more popular. She wouldn&#39;t pass this opportunity down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very popular. The cool guy that everyone flocks - star of the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, it wasn&#39;t she who changed - it was everyone else. That guy in the back of the cafeteria? Talk of the school. All the girls fawned over him and all the guys wanted to join his gang.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 18: If you were a guy... How would your language be? Soft-spoken or crude?<br />
<br />
Now that she had gone so far with this image, she may as well follow through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the prettiest, and I would not hesitate to use a swear or sexual term in casual conversations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet another mental change. From being quiet, to foul - her choice of words became dirty as can be.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 19: If you were a guy... What would your personality be like?<br />
<br />
And there it was...she could finally stop being so stupidly shy. She hated it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be confident, calm, and a flirt around other guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
As to be expected, she felt her mind blank over for a second, rearranging itself to fit her description. A nice-looking man passed by, catching her...his attention. He knew who he would go for next.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 20: If you were a guy... How tall would you be?<br />
<br />
His current height was shameful... 5&#39;4&quot; wouldn&#39;t do for a guy like him.<br />
<br />
&quot;6&#39;6&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wrote down, remaining calm as the inches packed on, quickly making him taller. Luckily, his clothes grew along with the change.<br />
<br />
FINAL QUESTION: If you were a guy... what would your name be?<br />
<br />
He already had a name in mind - not a very creative one, but it worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything where his old name - Belle - had been written, was not replaced with his new name - Ben. In fact... Everything changed to make it as if Ben had always been there, the only one aware of his previous self being he himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you have changed you life, why don&#39;t you do that same for somebody else? Pass the note on to anybody, it doesn&#39;t matter who!&quot; Appeared on the bottom on the note as everything else on it cleared.</p>
