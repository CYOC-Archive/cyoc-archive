<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Actually...&quot; Mark said. &quot;One more thing before I leave...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please Mark! Why don't you just leave me alone?!&quot; Josh dried to plead in his new tiny voice but his old friend seemed to have his mind made up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because if I leave you alone you'll be... lonely?&quot; he burst into a short laugh. &quot;Anyway, I want to make you one more gift before I leave you here to mature. Look at your hair - what can you tell me about it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Josh put her hands back and put her hair over her shoulder so that it rested in front of her. Also that's when she realized how thick and heavy it seemed compared to her old male hair. She run her hands through it feeling its soft texture... <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... It's straight and smooth...&quot; Josh started. &quot;Not the most ideal length for me...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is it not? Not long enough? I wish it was curly and down to you mid-thigh then!&quot; <br />
<br />
Josh wanted to protest but she was late. She felt pressure building up in her scalp as she watched her hair curled getting a more bouncy dynamic to it. Then the pressure was released and in one second her hair extended by another 7 inches. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's all very nice, and stuff...&quot; Mark said with a smile on his face. &quot;Although that's not quite what I meant. Can you tell me what color it is?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;D-da-dark b-brown?&quot; Josh whispered. Her new girly hormones weren't helping as she felt she started sobbing. <br />
<br />
Then Josh's eyes opened wide as suddenly he realized where Mark was going with all that hair talk. After Josh had described his ideal of femininity Mark made a silent wish about red-heads. Josh didn't know what it was about and Mark only promised him it was going to make gingers' lives so much more sexually exciting. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can see you know what I'm about to wish.&quot; Mark's smile got even bigger. &quot;And you will find out what I have planned for gingers like you... I wish Josh was a red-head with a fair complexion, dusting of freckles and everything else that comes with being a ginger girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
Immediately after Mark finished Josh looked down at his hair. The first thing she noticed changing though was the skin of her arms. It went very fair, almost royally alabaster white so that once could see thin blue veins showing trough. Josh remembered how for some reason she loved seeing veins showing through on women breasts. The thought that soon she'd have ones of her own saddened her. The skin seemed unblemished with the exception of freckles, gently sprinkled on her forearms and more and more of them as she looked up her arm and shoulder. Josh could only imagine how freckled her face was. How cute it looked. <br />
<br />
Then beginning form their tips up, every single hair on Josh's body turned from dark brown to almost copper red. Josh was now officially a red-maned cute-as-hell 10 year old girl. She was too busy with checking the most obvious changes to notice how something moved in her mouth and how her lips inflated the tiniest bit and parted a little which from now on was to be their default position. <br />
<br />
Josh turned to Mark who, not surprisingly, was still smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shoo... What exhachtly ish sho much differenth abouth me now?&quot; Josh gasped as she heard her lisping as she never lisped before. As her hand raced to her mouth she felt her fingers touch a pair of lips which seemed a little bit too big for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's so different? Well... Why don't you stick out your tongue for me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Josh wanted to tell Mark to go fuck himself but he found he couldn't make herself do it. Instead she found that the only thing that her body allowed her to do was anything that would result in sticking her tongue out. Josh was a girl now and Mark was the Fem-Master. Josh realized there was nothing he could do about receiving a direct command from him. And so her tongue went out. <br />
<br />
Josh looked cross-eyed at the impressive organ as it extended full 4 inches away from her face. No wonder she couldn't talk properly. Josh was surprised it could fit inside her mouth at all. She tried to wiggle it only to find it was extremely flexible. Now she could not only touch her nose with her tongue but she could easily poke herself in an eye with it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now tell me why, you think, I gave you such an impressive tongue? Or better don't strain yourself, let me explain.&quot; Marked leaned by the door. &quot;You see, it's the same for every red-head now. Once you get older your mouth will get one more purpose to it in addition to being there for eating and speaking. You will use it to please men. You've seen your tongue. Your lips also have gotten better, a little bit more puffy. Expect that to get better as you get older. I also removed your gag reflex. Don't expect your future deep-throats to get any more comfortable though. We just don't want you puking on anyone, do we? Now for the best part; as a ginger girl expect a strange craving to kick in once you get to the age of your first period. You will need semen. You will not like it. You will not enjoy the process of getting it. Rationally you won't want to get it. Always, however, a feeling you need cum will accompany you. It won't be strong but it will be always there. Like an itch you need to scratch and the more you wait the more annoying it gets... And once semen enters your body, trough either way, expect interesting things to happen...&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Josh looked at Mark in disbelief. Was it even possible that this guy used to be her best friend? How could someone get so drunk on power? <br />
<br />
Mark just smiled again and left.</p>
