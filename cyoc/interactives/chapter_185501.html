<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... Living breathing anthro babies!!  And with a yet another simple word swap, Amanda had changed her life in a most dramatic way she would have previously assumed to be impossible.  What was once an plainly decorated office boardroom filled with adult investors had become colorful pastel colored room reminiscent of daycare, with seven very young children occupying the room surrounding a soft, low to the ground office table.  Only Amanda hasn&#39;t just regressed her fellow members of the board, she changed their species too!  Surrounding her were a myriad of different anthro and fantasy creatures in little colorful business suits made of soft, but loose enough material to allow their fur to breath.  <br />
<br />
Before she could even take in any of the changes she made to the room, aside from the table being made of a much softer material, being lower to the ground (but not as low to the ground as a table for toddlers at a daycare would be) and having clipboards with papers on them and tablets in front of her coworkers so they could write more without their papers sinking into the soft material and making it harder to write, she noticed that her former boss of her three years as a secretary for this investment company, Alexander Greyhorn, had turned into a scaly orangish-brown mammal she had heard about when looking up strange endangered animals.  He had transformed into anthro Pangolin child that looked around two years old!  (For those readers who don&#39;t know, Pangolins are insect eating mammals famous for their scaled hides and Anteater-like long tongues which in some species can double the length of their whole bodies.  They&#39;re endemic to South East Asia and North West and Central Africa.  They are the most illegally trafficked mammals in the world thanks to some quacks in the Traditional Chinese Medicine circles claiming that their unique Pangolin scales (which are made of Keratin like our fingernails and Rhino horns) can be used as a cancer treatment.  They can also curl into a ball for defense and sometimes to roll away, depending on the species, and the some of the species of Pangolins can only climb trees while other land based species can walk bipedially with their two front arms raised in front of them for balance, like a scaly T-Rex.  The mommy Pangolins also carry their young on their bellies or backs, as the claws that the Pangolins use for digging through dirt and termite and insect infested trees are used by the Pangolin babies to hang onto their mothers for dear life.)  He had a little tuft of wirey looking brown hair on his head, styled once again into a bad comb-over, and was wearing a little purple two piece suit, but apparently he was eating during the meeting because he was also wearing a bib with the words &quot;Ant&#39;s Worst Nightmare&quot; written on it in soft baby blue letters.  Right in front of him on what Amanda realized was his highchair was four ants on a log, but instead of raisins, Amanda realized that embedded the peanut butter of each log of celery was a bunch of live ants that he was extending his long, sticky prehensile tongue to gather up and slurp them back into his mouth.<br />
<br />
  Gagging a little at the sight of his lunch, Amanda quickly looked away from the happy Pangolin boy and noticed that little Alex&#39;s former second in command, Patricia (I guess she&#39;s just &quot;Patty&quot; now) is now a little three year old White Honduran Fruit Bat girl wearing a two piece pink suit with a frilly skirt.  She was looking at Amanda with big black eyes while absent mindedly sucking her left hands claw-thumb while holding a little magical girl anime doll in her right arm (she was always a bit of a weeabo).  She had big puffy white fur that could barely fit in her two piece suit, which Amanda noticed must have been the loosest fitting of all the suits, large yellow ears that twitched in time with every suckle of her thumb, a yellow indented snout that looked heart shaped and two yellow membranes of skin that made up her leathery wings.  From the way Patty was looking at her, Amanda could tell she was clearly hanging onto her every word, like a little student paying extra attention to their favorite teacher.  The attention and possible affection she was showering her boss with made Amanda nervously blush and look away towards the two co-workers she hates the most, hoping this time she could look at the changes made to them without it being too awkward.  She turned her head with a wry little smirk to look at the changes she made to her least favorite people in the world, Derek Richards and Susan Van Damme.  And she shat her pants in absolute joy when she realized that her two most hated people in the world were made not only younger than her (aged down to what looked like one year old and noticeably teething on what looked like a puppy chew toys) but they were both changed into the smelliest animals she nose (hehe).  Derek had been changed into Muskrat (brown furred with long, rat-like tails and and fat beaver-like bodies) wearing Navy Blue two piece suit and Susan into a pink furred skunk girl with bright yellow two piece suit with a frilly skirt that allowed her long tail to hang out.  The two lovebirds were sitting very close to each other and Susan seemed to even be trying waft her tails scent over his snout (Amanda knew that Susan had slept her way onto the board WITH DEREK, thanks to her accidentally walking into their lovemaking session at a company retreat when she accidentally entered Susan&#39;s room after having too many margaritas that night), and lil&#39; Derek was raising his snout, sniffing it approvingly, his Beaver-like buck teeth making biting motions like he wanted to eat her scent (awfully lewd behaviour for babies, were they anthro adults before, or they just trying to imitate mommy and daddy, or is she over thinking this and he&#39;s just teething?).<br />
<br />
  As much as she hates them and got a kick out of them being less mobile than her with their own less dexterous and coordinated one year old bodies, she decided she had enough of their weird baby flirting and turned her head to the last two members of the board, Douglas Freeman III and David Yoshida.  Before they were the only minorities on the board (African and Japanese American, respectively) now they&#39;re the only MYTHICAL CREATURES in the room!  Douglas was turned into an anthro Dragon child with purple scales and a tail that ended in a spade, he looked to be some age between two and three and had a shiny rainbow colored two piece suit that had a big button on it&#39;s chest pocket that said &quot;Bi Pride&quot; in big rainbow colored letters.  He was looking kind of bored and and had a shiny gold toy robot in his right hand that he was pretending was flying around while feigned paying attention to his boss, his head sinking into his left hand, elbow on the table.  Meanwhile Davey&#39;s change was a little more culturally specific, as he had become a light Orange furred Kitsune boy wearing a stylish Japanese formal robe, he had three full length tails with small blue flames above them denoting that he was over three hundred years old, despite looking physically like three year old anthro Fox kit (Amanda began to wonder if he was three hundred years old in knowledge but was emotionally and physically three or if he was three in mind and body, but then realized it she thought too hard about this, she might get freaked out about the logic of her OWN body of knowledge in business despite having clear difficulties reading and writing in her own three year old body).  He was playing with a paddle ball while a pudgy looking small clay statue was moving on the desk and writing notes for him highlighting all of her business talk she had said moments ago before the latest change.  The clay statue had a Yiddish symbol written on his forehead, at which point Amanda remembered that the David from before the change had married a Jewish women a few years ago, she guessed that in this new reality they were still at least a couple and she must also been magic and/or mythical and made that Golem for him to use as a personal secretary to make his job easier for him since he has a kids attention span and can&#39;t always be on the ball at work.<br />
<br />
It was then she noticed the table was also littered with a combination of children&#39;s crayon drawings and business documents with simplified language combined with emoji-like symbols that she assumed were there to help the board members with their severely reduced reading comprehension to keep up.  The also noticed the walls were colored with paintings of little chibi humans getting up in the yellow crack of dawn, having breakfast, driving to work under a big blue sky to an office job, having lunch, then meetings, then going to cubicle, and then driving back at the purple light of dawn, and going to sleep as bright yellow stars shined in a black sky with crescent moon as the man in the moon gives them thumbs up for a job well done.  It was when she looked at the wall drawing that she noticed their pull-down projector screen was the only thing that hadn&#39;t changed, though their projectors remote looked slightly larger and more kid friendly.  The rooms computer also looked very different, it was white with green lines around its edges, and had the logo for a company that she had never heard of before on the back of its monitor called &quot;Toddler Tech&quot;, said logo was printed to look like a toddlers scribbly writing, complete with the occasional backwards letter, and mismatched capitalization.  It also has a larger, easier to read qwerty keyboard and reminded her of those children&#39;s game consoles that came out in the decade before last like Leapfrog, and other so-called edu-tainment consoles that tried to reach little kids to learn.  The last bit of differences she noted about the room was that they had various toy chest with toys of all kinds ( toys for babies, toddlers, and big kids) scattered against the room, two fully stocked changing tables, and they even had a part of the wall filled with large construction paper stuck to it with heavy adhesive tape for them to draw on with crayons, colored pencils, paint tubes, and markers scattered about it on the floor and in a see through purplish box nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot; Hewwoooo!  Erff to &#39;Manda!  What were yew sayin&#39; &#39;bout the eawnings a second ago!? &quot;  Said little Susie, her usual rude self made Amanda realize she had spent a quite a bit of time staring at the changes she made to her reality instead of continuing her presentation.  &quot;Sowwy guys, I musta not had vewy fiwwing wunch.  I gots distwacted by da funny wittle men in da wall!&quot;  Which was partially true, they were all so colorful, fun and eye-catching, though she somehow got the urge to draw on it to make it more pretty.  &quot;Dat is twue, plus it&#39;s gettin&#39; kinda wate, why don&#39;t we wrap dis Meetin&#39; up?&quot;  Said Alex the peanut butter covered Pangolin baby as he chewed up his last piece of celery.  It was him mentioning the hour that made Amanda look at her left hand to look at her watch that she noticed.....</p>
