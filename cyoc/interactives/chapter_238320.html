<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was on cloud nine. This had to be the funniest outcome he could have hoped for. He did plan to switch the two of them back at some point. But in the meantime, he had his own personal dick-sucker right here at home. There was still that one problem though, if they got caught, the world could react… negatively.<br />
<br />
There was a solution to that specific problem. Jeff knew exactly what to do. Sure, an incest relationship with his sister was fun, but he pictured a much better future with riper fruits. If he just moved those girlfriend emotions to his mom, then he could do what he just did with Alice, without the risk of getting caught. After all, if Alice did catch them, what would she do? Sure, she could tell someone, but who would believe her. What’s more, her could just swap around her emotions on the matter and be done. <br />
<br />
Jeff returned to the Chronivac and replaced Jenny’s name with his mother’s. He left everything else the same and presses the swap button again, so his mom and Alice would swap relationships with Jeff. Once again, nothing appeared to change. Alice was still showering, so he went downstairs. He could hear his mom working on dinner, and thought it would be the perfect time to interrupt.<br />
<br />
Walking into the kitchen, he saw her chopping vegetables with her back toward him. Jeff silently walked up behind her. This time, he had full faith in the Chronivac. He bumped his crotch into her butt from behind, surprising his dear mother.<br />
<br />
Sheila was caught off guard, she hadn’t expected her son to sneak up on her like that. She glanced behind her and gazed up at him. She felt her heart flutter when he grabbed her by the chin and tilted her head up.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled her into a passionate kiss, with lots of the same tongue he used on Alice earlier. But this time, Sheila clearly had more experience than her daughter. The skill she used was evidence that, to her, this was something she had performed and mastered after years of practice. Jeff’s hand reached down, squeezing her butt, getting a little moan out of his mother.<br />
<br />
In those moments, Jeff took advantage of their new relationship and reached up her shirt. He groped her boobs while their tongues were down each other’s throats. In the heat of their passion, they didn’t notice Alice leave the shower. In fact, it wasn’t until they heard her footsteps coming down the stairs that they let go of one another. <br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised at how quickly Shiela jumped back to being his mother. She told both of them to sit at the table while she finished up with her cooking.<br />
<br />
Jeff and his sister did just that. While they waited for their mother, Alice chirped up her own conversation. With a scowl of cold command that he’d only seen on their mother, she asked, “Jeff have you finished your homework yet?”<br />
<br />
“Um… No Alice, not yet.” It took a second for Jeff to understand where this was coming from, then he remembered what emotion swapping meant. Clearly Alice now saw her relationship with Jeff and mother and son, exactly what Sheila used to have.<br />
<br />
“Make sure you to finish your homework before going to bed. I don’t want to find out that you’re missing assignments.”<br />
<br />
They ate dinner as a family. Under the table Sheila brushed her feet up against Jeff’s. That made the lecture he was receiving from Alice all the more hilarious. The disparity between the way Alice had acted before was a little funny to Jeff. Alice still had that look of a parent trying to impart wisdom on their child, wisdom that she definitely did not have. Sheila was giving him goo-goo eyes from across the table, the total opposite of what a mother should give their child.<br />
<br />
That night, Jeff went to bed thinking about how much fun he would have with his mom, but he still hadn’t gotten very far. He considered walking to her room and have the fun he wanted so much. Before he could though, the door to his room opened, and in walked Sheila, dressed in only a teddy. “I think Alice is asleep. Are you ready big-boy?”<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised she was so forward, but this was the opportunity he had hoped for. He hopped into his bed, ready for whatever she had planned for him.<br />
<br />
Sheila crawled up next to him and started pulling off her clothes. Jeff did the same, being very careful not to make too much noise. Stark naked, the two had their elicit affair. Sheila took the lead, riding up and down on his cock. Jeff had the time of his life. He bounced her up and down in cowgirl position, until he pumped her full of his load. They kept going all night until Sheila was too tired to keep going, and she fell asleep, cuddling him on his bed.</p>
