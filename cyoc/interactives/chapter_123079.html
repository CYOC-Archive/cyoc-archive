<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taking out a Hot Stuff licensed cell phone (the comic had seen a revival on Princess&#39; world), Jill&#39;Lith dialed up Princess&#39; number, Jill&#39;Lith had been given it not for social calls or if she was in trouble, but purely to let Princess know how things were going. Jill&#39;Lith dialed up the predictable and cliche number for the spoiled brat, rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Princes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jill&#39;Lith! About time! So how many new imps do we have now?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s kinda funny that way...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jill&#39;Lith took one minutes to explain, at first Princess seemed happy that the meme was working a proper barrier against the baby furs... but then how it wasn&#39;t doing its true hidden purpose... <br />
<br />
Five minutes of cussing later, Princess finished screaming Jill&#39;Lith&#39;s ear off and hung up. Jill&#39;Lith could already imagine Princess ripping some of her giant stuffed animals to shreds to blow off steam at the failure, and didn&#39;t want to be the programmer&#39;s place right now who had made the meme to begin with. <br />
<br />
Getting bored of the news, Jill&#39;Lith switched to watching reruns of Ren and Stimpy. She laid back in the and put her feet up, looking at herself. She also turned the easy chair white with red buttons. <br />
<br />
Red skin, white clothes, black horns, and yellow spiral eyes. The unifying traits of the imps. For all the wild an mismatching that the imps took, they ironically had a lot that bound them together. <br />
<br />
Jill&#39;Lith... did they really have to stick &#39;Lith&#39; at the end of all their names? It got boring fast. But it was supposed to be how it was inspired Lilith or some nonsense. She knew it was meant to make their names all sound more fiendish, but Jill was imp enough to admit it sounded silly after a while. <br />
<br />
There was theory running among her sisters (they were all daughters of chaos after all now), that the curse had been meant to turn Princess into a succubus, but Princess hadn&#39;t been purely evil or vile enough, and so the transformation that had made her the template that all imps would follow had done the best it could. The result had been a buncha imps trying to look like grown up succubi, but looking adorable at worst, or just plain ridiculous at worst. It didn&#39;t matter anyway, they were imps anyway, nipples, belly button, space between the legs, all of it featureless now. <br />
<br />
Jill&#39;Lith did feel a slight kinship with the baby furs over that, they now separate from the natural laws of recreation. Jill&#39;Lith didn&#39;t know baby furs were figuring out ways to increase their numbers possibly with play-doh, but for now, the imps numbers were static without new converts, and no imps had really worked together long enough to figure out how to make more imps on their own. Nor had Princess bullied her little sisters in pursuing it. Now that Jill&#39;Lith could seriously complain about that, bullying those weaker than you to do what you wanted was just the imp way. <br />
<br />
A dog came in from the doggie door. Jill&#39;Lith petted it. The dog went stiff, and its eyes turned to glass, its skin and fur became cloth and fake fur, and its inside turned into fluff. The dog was now just a extension of her. She had the plush dog puppet leap into her lap, and she absent-mindedly petted it. She looked at it, a brown beagle. &quot;Your name is Cerbby now.&quot; She made the plush puppet bark and then had it nuzzle her. <br />
<br />
She hear noises... two humans coming ... finally. If she had to it a couple humans at the time... maybe she should just get it done. She crept behind the door. It swung open, and an elderly couple stepped in. Blech. Old. That was something Jill&#39;Lith DIDN&#39;T miss about being human. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even hesitate. She leapt behind shouting, &quot;SURPRISE!&quot; and touch them from behind. <br />
<br />
Jill&#39;Lith admitted, the impulse remained strong, the satisfaction of spread their curse. <br />
<br />
They shrank down in height and age until they were both a tiny bit shorter than her. The hallmark features came in, the rubbery red skin, losing any sexual traits, the black claws in place of finger nails, the swirling yellow eyes, the white hair. The one that had been the wife was still a little pudgy, she wore a white apron and nothing else. Her black horns looked like a cow&#39;s. Her hair vanished and she became balled, a gold ring sticking out of her nose. <br />
<br />
The other new imp was wearing just a pair of white overalls with black buttons, rather conservative for a imp even if it made her look more like a tomboy as her hair lengthened behind her into a braid that went down her back and ended in a sharp spaded end. Her horns were barely visible, a pair of tiny ewe horns. <br />
<br />
The two turned around... they were smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi big sister Jill&#39;Lith! I&#39;m Em&#39;lith!&quot; Said the bald cow girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Hen&#39;Lilth!&quot; Said the long haired tomboy. <br />
<br />
What was that stupid speech Princess wanted her to give? Oh right. &quot;Ahem, you are both, yada yada, blab blah, let&#39;s skip most of this. You&#39;re part of Princess&#39; imp invasion force! To defeat the Baby Furs and transform the human race!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two new imps kicked their feet together and saluted. &quot;Aye-aye!&quot; They laughed. <br />
<br />
Jill&#39;Lith put her little clawed hands on her hip. Her snake headed tail hissing violently behind her at the two new imps. &quot;I&#39;m the oldest, since I became an imp before you, so I&#39;m in charge, make me desert!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay big sister!&quot; The two said, and got right to work. <br />
<br />
Jill&#39;Lith shook her head. &quot;Okay, this is embarrassing, you two come back here. I hope this doesn&#39;t need to be explained to all the new recruits... Imps don&#39;t do anything unless they&#39;re made to! The imps who can bully you around the most is in charge, and the imps you can bully the most you&#39;re in charge of. Princess&#39; one rule is that you can&#39;t be totally awful to imps that you were related to before becoming imps. All other imps are fair game. If you&#39;re going to be helpful, be so annoying and infuriating about that it makes me want to tear my hair out! And-&quot;<br />
<br />
Em&#39;lith hit her in the face with an apple pie. The two new imps laughed mockingly at her misfortune. <br />
<br />
Jill&#39;Lith wiped the pie away. Feeling a hint of pride for someone else. &quot;Okay... that was actually pretty good, congrats. But next time pull on my tail while I&#39;m distracted and kick me while I&#39;m down.&quot;</p>
