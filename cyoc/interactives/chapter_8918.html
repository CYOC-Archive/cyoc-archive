<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Ty woke up the next day, he wondered if it had all been a dream. He walked over to the mirror and examined himself, dispelling his fears. He was perfect. His cheekbones were high and his lips were full, and he had eyes so green and so deep that he could almost feel himself getting lost in them. His hair was perfect, and he hadn't even done anything to it yet. And his body, he had a body to die for. He flexed his biceps and growled at himself in the mirror.<br />
&quot;Fuck, Ty, you're so hot.&quot; He said, and he knew it was true. He went and took a shower, admiring his body, feeling his strong pecs and his 8 pac.<br />
He stepped out of the shower and walked over to the mirror, feeling a litle dizzy. Then he immediately went into his normal morning routine to make himself look beautiful. When he was finished, he looked perfect. His hair was messy, but like a model's. His teeth sparkled, and he smelled great.<br />
When he finally got out of the bathroom and went to his room to get dressed, he felt a slight pressure in his head while he was reaching for his normal sweat shirt and yesterday's jeans. Reality shifted for a moment, and then he picked up those clothes. &quot;These are Dustin's, why would I want them.&quot; He tossed them aside and reached for an Abercrombie and Fitch shirt and a pair of stone washed jeans. He slipped into his clothing, relishing the way they tightly fit to his body, showing off his muscular and sexy phsyique.<br />
&quot;Nothing but the best for the most popular and sexy guy at school.&quot; He thought, picking up his wallet off the counter. He was beginning to forget his previous life as wimpy Ty as the spell took over and transformed him, in every way, into the most popular guy at school. He opened it up, seeing the money inside, and smiled to himself. There was a momentary fuzziness to his vision as reality resettled itself once again, and then he was no longer in a small suburban home, they were in an enormous home suitable to the richest family in the area. He momentarily thanked his stars that both his parents had always been so successful.<br />
He picked up his cell and noticed it was flashing. Messages, no surprise. He had forgotten it at home last night while he was out partying (Why did that seem weird?). He figured he'd skim through them real quick.<br />
&quot;Hey Ty, last week was great. I--&quot; The female voice cut off as he switched it. The usual message from the usual one night stand.<br />
&quot;Ty, I never experienced anything like that. You--&quot; Ty smirked, switching the message. Grabbing his crotch, he thought about how he wasn't the most popular guy at school for nothing. His sexual technique was so legendary he could turn straight guys gay for him.<br />
&quot;Hey Ty, I landed the movie deal for your next big flick. It's an action film, you're starring with Sean William Scott, but you'll be playing the lead. I need you to call me later so I can tell you all the details.&quot; Ty laughed, another action film. If it wasn't action films it was romantic comedies. He'd done a few dramas too, but they weren't as fun. The public couldn't seem to get enough of him. The older crowd for his amazing acting skills, the younger for his hot body. At only 16, Ty was one of the richest kids in the world.<br />
He turned off his cell, not caring about the rest of the messages, when he heard grunting down the hall. He looked out the door with disdain, it was his step brother Dustin trying to get into a pair of pants. No matter what he did for the boy, he couldn't seem to help this kid be anything more than the gross slug he was. Whatever.<br />
He grabbed his bag and headed downstairs, greeted by his parents with a kiss and a hug. &quot;Dustin, come on!&quot; He yelled, and Dustin nearly fell down the stairs in his eagerness to get downstairs. Ty shrugged, if anything, Dustin looked up to Ty as if Ty was a God (which Ty very nearly was.)<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I couldn't find my math book--&quot;<br />
&quot;Whatever, let's go.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dustin, you've got to get up earlier in the morning instead of making Ty wait around forever.&quot; Ty's mother reprimanded.<br />
Dustin hung his head and started trudging through the door.<br />
Not for the first time, Ty felt sorry for him.<br />
<br />
School went as always. The moment Ty got there people flocked to him, wanting to be near him, to see him, touch him. He got a few party invites, and some come-ons. As in all his classes as usual, it wasn't too tough for someone as smart as he was to maintain the head of the class position. There was a quick makeout session with his teacher, Mr. Kraiser, who happened to be one of the hottest teachers in school. Okay, Ty WAS 16, he couldn't help himself sometimes. He ran into Dustin a few times during the day, always alone, always being pushed around, and felt a little bad again. He was nothing if not empathetic.<br />
<br />
He didn't get home 'till around 1 because there was football practice (it was tough being captain of the football, wrestling, and basketball teams), and he had a birthday party to go to that night, and when he came home he crashed immediately, tired from, well, you can imagine. As he fell asleep, his thoughts turned to Dustin for some reason. Maybe it was because he could hear Dustin's loud snoring down the hall. If only he could do SOMETHING to help him, but he'd tried everything--oh wait, there was that.<br />
His power. This could be the perfect opportunity to try it for the first time.<br />
He thought for one moment that he shouldn't transform Dustin for some reason, that Dustin didn't deserve it. But why wouldn't poor Dustin deserve it? Poor step brother Dustin, the adopted boy, the wimpy little kid who nobody liked at school. Besides, it was really bad for his image to have Dustin for a brother.<br />
Ty began the transformation.<br />
&quot;I wish Dustin was not only my full brother, but that he was the second hottest and most popular guy in school. Second only to me, that is. I wish he'll always be second to me, but we will always love each other so it will be all right.&quot;<br />
He wondered why he had added in the bit about loving each other for a moment, and chalked it up to his pity for his brother, but it was only a moment because then he was asleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning, he woke up and went through his normal morning routine, making himself pretty to live his life. God, he loved his life. Once he was downstairs and got the normal pats on the back from his parents, he called for Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming bro! Sorry, couldn't find my watch.&quot; Dustin called, and then came downstairs. At a muscular 6'2&quot;, Dustin looked alot like Ty had at 15, and was into pretty much the same sports, and head of his class. Ty had even talked about getting Dustin into some serious acting (so far they had only done some brother movies which had done well, but Dustin wanted a career of his own. Ty had been famous since he was born, but Dustin thought he could at least achieve half the fame of his brother). They high fived each other and then hugged each other. They were brothers but they were best friends. They loved each other like family should.<br />
Momentarily Dustin and Ty's mom fussed over him. &quot;Why can't you boys comb your hair even, like your dad?&quot; She said.<br />
&quot;Mom, it's the way guys wear their hair nowadays. It's very metrosexual.&quot; Dustin flashed a sarcastic and charming grin.<br />
Ty laughed and grabbed his brother in a headlock. &quot;My ass. Let's go before we're late for school.&quot;<br />
As they walked out the door, Dustin said &quot;I can't wait till I get my liscence.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just a year more, bro.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude, that party last night was killer. Did you see that one hot chick?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was too busy making out with her and her boyfriend to see her.&quot;<br />
Once they were out of ear shot, Ty and Dustin's mom and dad turned and looked happily at their family portrait, showing the whole family standing together and smiling brightly.</p>
