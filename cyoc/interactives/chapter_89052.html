<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…let’s walk.”  She decided as she stretched her arms out, the act causing a button on her shirt to pop loose and fly away.  <br />
<br />
Coming from the one over her breasts, this gave me a good glimpse of them.  Coated in the silver-grey fur that she had all over her now, and likely proportionally the same size they’d been originally.  She must have known I was looking at them as she asked me “Like what you see?  Want to see more?”  With a smirk on her elongated face.  <br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah.”  I somehow managed to say.  <br />
<br />
“Well you know what you need to do to make that happen.”  She teased me as her arm came around me and forced me to keep pace with her.  <br />
<br />
“Of course, my Big Bad Sexy Wolfess.”  I got the hint as she became ever so slightly taller, her muscles thickened further and several more buttons flew off, and now her pants were opening at the front.  And I could see that she didn’t have any underwear on as well as the lack of a bra.  It was, surprising, to say the least.  <br />
<br />
As we made our way to the park, I dawned on me that she was starting to look at me rather more hungrily than I was comfortable with.  To try and distract myself from it, I thought about things to talk about, but not much came to mind, at least until a thought occurred to me.  <br />
<br />
“So?  Uh?  Why a werewolf?”  I asked her.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm?”  She mumbled as she turned to look at me.  The jaws definitely looked like they had a lot of power behind them.  <br />
<br />
“Why did you want to be a werewolf?”  <br />
<br />
“Well, I’ll explain if you say it.”  She replied with a grin that put me ill at ease.  <br />
<br />
“O-kay.  So the explanation is?  My Big Bad Sexy Wolfess?”  This brought a deep moan from Kelly as her shirt opened all the way at her front, and began to tear along the back as well now along with the shoulder seams that continued down her arms.  As for her pants, they were open at the front and ripping open down the inside, allowing a tail to slide out from it, while her fur-surrounded pussy looked to be a little wet.  <br />
<br />
“I’ve always loved them.”  She began, her voice deeper than before, if still feminine.  “Power, speed, endurance, intelligence.  Depending on who’s interpreting them.  Not the types that leave them mindless beasts, but the ones that keep their intellect and augment it with cunning and wit.”  It was now I noticed that her free hand was being used to hold her pants up, seeing as the waist of them were ruined.  <br />
<br />
“I…see…”  I began then faltered, wondering how I should move on this topic.  At least I could be safe from a feral beast based on her account, but the way she looked at me suggested that she must have had something in mind, and given how far along she was now, I was under no illusion that she could force it if I resisted.  <br />
<br />
“Again.”  She practically ordered.  <br />
<br />
“What again?  My Big Bad Sexy Wolfess?”  I half-asked, half-complied.  <br />
<br />
“That.”  She sighed deeply as her pants and shirt couldn’t hold on to her swelling frame any more.  Both from her own expanding body and her tearing the scraps off, discarding them into the first bin we came across.  “Much better, I was getting cramped in them.”  She exhaled as she displayed her virtually naked lupine-like body to anyone who would pass.  <br />
<br />
Before Kelly had only come to about halfway up my head, now she was a good head taller than me, arms legs and torso thick with muscle that rippled with raw power.  What used to be her hair was now just a longer portion of the dark silver-grey fur that covered practically the entirety of her, save for the black paw pads.  A thick tail swayed behind her with each step she took and her hands and feet were ended with sharp black claws that could easily tear me apart if she so wished.  And somehow the sandals I’d wished onto her from earlier in the day were still fitting beautifully, larger than before to accommodate her larger feet.  I thought about wishing them away, but if she asked, I could use it as a bail-out later, saying that they had been the test-wish I’d made.  Certainly believable enough to me.  <br />
<br />
I did a mental count, eight of the ten uses of the phrase had been used so far, and I began to wonder what the next two would result in.  Looking at her chest, her breasts were still noticeable through the fur if looking a little smaller relative to the rest of her.  Perhaps that was to keep them from being a nuisance?  <br />
<br />
That question would need to wait though, as we’d reached the park now.  Very large in terms of size, and giving the City some greenery.  Moments later, Kelly led me to one of the park benches where we sat for the moment, and a look around told me we were alone right now.  <br />
<br />
“So? Kelly?  Why are we here?”  I questioned, noting the hungry look I was receiving from her as she turned slightly to face me better, one leg over the other.</p>
