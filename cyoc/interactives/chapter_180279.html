<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clyde’s eyes were overwhelmed with light, he couldn’t see anything. He rubbed his eyes with his veiny muscular hands.<br />
<br />
He looked around, it was... corridor. The floor was tiled, the walls were... tiled. The ceiling, well you can probably guess. There were doors lining the walls, each pretty well spaced. The walls were pretty tall, somewhere around twice Clyde’s current height.<br />
“So y’ add it in, huh?” A faraway voice said, echoing throughout the corridor. She was around 6 doors ahead. Clyde looked behind him, he saw the opening hinge shut. Whether he wanted to or not, he didn’t have a way of leaving. He picked up the pace and jogged over to Alaska.<br />
Without much effort, he was travelling at regular run pace in the old body. He caught up to Alaska, who was simply walking, in no time.<br />
“So what are we doing here?” Clyde asked, unable to hide his curiosity,<br />
“You’ll see, it’s right up here, room 258,” she said, pointing ahead,<br />
“What’re all these other rooms?” Clyde asked,<br />
“Some of them are testing rooms, some are manufacturing rooms, some are changing rooms (which is a pun by the way),” she winked at him, “and then these ones,” she said, placing her hand on room 258, “are creating rooms,” she pushed open the door.<br />
Clyde half expected to see a giant fantastical land made out of candy. But instead, he found a single machine, it was a small round table, and on top was a PC sized white machine with logo on it. The logo was of ‘Alaska Blair’s Unusual Candy Store’.<br />
<br />
“So, Mr Clyde. Or do you prefer Mr Oswald?” She asked, smirking a little harder than usual,<br />
“H-how do you know my surname..?” Clyde asked, the tiniest hint of fear in his voice,<br />
“I think we both know the answer, don’t we,” she smirked again, “now!” She started, stepping into the room. She waved for Clyde to come in too. He did. As he stepped in, he noted that the ceiling was a little lower. Alaska was hunching over a little bit, “excuse me for a moment,” she said. He slowly but surely got to her knees. She now a little shorter than Clyde.<br />
<br />
“How happy are you with your changes?” She asked Clyde, getting straight to the point,<br />
“Uhm... I mean, I love it, it’s amazing... but I wouldn’t want to stay this way my entire life,” he responded shyly, scared to upset Alaska,<br />
“No no, silly man,” she patted him in the head gently, “not like that. Would you change anything about your transformation, like a common one is height,” she specified,<br />
“Oh... no I wouldn’t. The height is fine, these muscles are perfect, I can fit into everything, and the stuff I can’t fit into is perfect!” She said,<br />
“Great! But just to make sure, nothing minute, like toenail length or something,”<br />
“Um...” Clyde had to think, “I mean... I like the hair, all of it. On my head, my body, my face... but it could be tidier. I do feel a bit like a caveman with how scruffy it is,”<br />
“Perfect!” Alaska said, clapping her hands together in relief, “nothing a Snip can’t fix,” she said,<br />
“A what!?” Clyde asked, his hands instinctively fell over his crotch. Alaska didn’t pick up on this. Instead, she lifted her hand up and poked a tile on the ceiling. It fell down. But before it hit the ground, it began to hover.<br />
<br />
The tile started to fold itself into short cylinder. It buzzed around the room, over Alaska and Clyde’s heads. Clyde was a lot more cautious of the machine. It finished its course and floated in front of Alaska. An androgynous voice spoke,<br />
“Calibration Complete. Please Specify Mode.”<br />
Alaska cleared her throat, “Snip!” She said, cheerfully.<br />
<br />
Quickly, the hovering robot shifted, a hole popped out the top and revealed a pair of scissors. On the opposite side, an electric razor.<br />
“Hello Miss Blair!” The voice said, this time with much more personality, “how may I help?”<br />
“Well, Snip,” Alaska said, joining in with the playful attitude of Snip, “my friend Clyde over here would like all his hair to be cleaned up. His head, his face, his body, even his private area,”<br />
Snip gave a robotic chuckle as they away from Alaska and appeared in front of Clyde, “what would you like me to change, Mister Clyde?” Snip asked,<br />
“Oh- I um- just everything cleaned up, but around the same...” Clyde said, nervously. He was talking to a robot, after all, he was a little scared. He noticed two animated eyes on the front of the machine, as well. They seemed to match what Snip was saying.<br />
“Please do not move, this is a very precise procedure, I don’t want to accidentally hurt you!” Snip said, proceeded by a robotic giggle. Ship floated backwards a little before a third slot opened. Out popped a small... thing. Clyde couldn’t tell what it was. That was, until a red dot shone out.<br />
The red dot began to shine on his shirt. From the top it pointed down to the bottom. It didn’t cut it though. The light went out, then came back at his half-jeans. It shone from each side to his pants, one leg then the next. It then repeated this again.<br />
“The first part is complete, don’t move for 4 more seconds,” Snip said.<br />
Clyde was frozen still, terrified of what could potentially happen if he moved even an inch. But as soon as those four seconds were up,<br />
<br />
BOINK!<br />
<br />
His clothes suddenly slit apart at the cut lines, falling off his body. His shirt, his half-jeans, even his underwear.<br />
He was completely nude, aside from his socks. Which quickly Snip flew down and cut off with the scissors.<br />
<br />
“Now for this next part, I advise you close your eyes!” Snip said,<br />
“W-why?” Clyde had to ask,<br />
“It makes the whole routine take longer when you can see me. You will not feel a thing, so it makes it much much quicker.” Snip replied,<br />
“And we need it to be quick, because that laser really drains their battery,” Alaska chimed in.<br />
<br />
Clyde looked at Alaska, then at Snip, then took a deep breath and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
It was around five minutes later when Clyde heard Snip say, “finished!” Cheerfully.<br />
Clyde had to admit, he wasn’t as scared as he imagined he would be. All he heard were the light clippings that came from the scissors.<br />
<br />
“Now snip, can you reveal the mirror?” Alaska asked,<br />
“Of course, Miss Blair!” Snip replied. They flew to a panel on the wall, without touching it, the panel turned itself around and revealed a mirror.<br />
<br />
Clyde looked at himself. He looked pretty much the same, but much cleaner. His beard was perfectly trimmed, his hair looked like it usually did. His chest hair looked much much better. He did like the rough look before, but this made him look fresh and feel fresher. His armchair and leg hair didn’t look too different, maybe a little less out fo control. And finally, the giant rainforest of pubic hair was now a much tidier and made him feel much cleaner.<br />
<br />
“This is perfect!” Clyde said, unexpectedly joyful at his look, “Snip you did a fantastic job!” He said. Snip gave a playful giggle and flew around him. Clyde couldn’t help but giggle too, he was smiling ear from ear.<br />
Alaska saw this and gave a very genuine smile back.<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s get to why we’re here,” Alaska said, getting back to the task at hand.</p>
