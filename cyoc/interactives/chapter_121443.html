<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jack and Kenya continued another spirited round of wild animalistic sex, a loud pounding could be heard coming from the front door of the condo.<br />
“Jack Crawford,” a man could be heard shouting; “this is the FBI! Open up! We have a warrant to search your premises.”<br />
Another loud knock comes before a man in an immaculately pressed suit opens up the door with all the stiffness and pomposity of a professional manservant.<br />
<br />
“Master Crawford is indisposed,” the butler looking at the men in suits; seeing them wearing bullet proof vests with the FBI lettering in bold yellow emblazoned on them did not stop the man from refusing them entry.<br />
“Get him now,” the federal agent displaying all the warmth and gaiety of a napalm enema; producing the search warrant and shoving in the butler’s face as he tries to barge in.<br />
“You will wait,” the butler not backing down; displaying that he was stronger than he looked as he took the piece of paper and gave it a cursory examination.<br />
“Out of our way,” the federal agent threatening the man; “or you will be arrested for obstruction and possibly assault.”<br />
<br />
The butler giving the federal agent a withering look and his compatriots; seeing several of them already brandishing fire arms and ready to use them if required.<br />
“Master Crawford,” the butler speaking; “is currently engaged with his wife in bed. As befitting husband and wife on their honeymoon,” the butler pausing so the men could hear what was transpiring in the master bedroom.<br />
This made several of the federal agents blush in embarrassment as they hear the sounds of an intense carnal act taking place. However the lead agent wasn’t so moved and continued to press the man.<br />
“I could care less if your boss is fucking a tiger up the ass,” the federal agent speaking; pausing to form his next sentence as he could swear he just heard a loud yowl. “Get Jack Crawford here. Right! Fucking! Now!”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Several minutes later and after a few choice words from both the butler and the lead federal agent, Jack Crawford and his wife Kenya were both sitting on the living room couch. Both with a murderous intent in their eyes and wearing nothing but bathrobes. Hearing his butler’s shouting, Jack was about to rip off the man’s head for disturbing him and Kenya; yet hearing him arguing with another man who barged into his home and hearing the man threatening to arrest him, Both he and Kenya had to shift from their were-panther forms as they tossed on some robes for modesty purposes.<br />
<br />
“You are making a big mistake,” Jack snarling at the agent; “barging into my home, threatening me and my butler!”<br />
“I’d advise you to keep your mouth shut,” the federal agent cutting Jack off; “lest you want us to use what you say against you.”<br />
“Am I under arrest?” Jack bursting from his seat; “if so you better have a mountain of evidence to back it up. Because when my lawyer is through with this bullshit, he is going to turn you into fertilizer!”<br />
<br />
“Sit down and shut up,” the agent being belligerent; “I already know you called your lawyer. You can have him meet you at the FBI’s field office,” the agent observing as those accompanying him remove Jack’s computer and various other electronic devices. “And before you make another bloated and far reaching threat,” the federal agent glaring at Jack as he glares at him; “we have a lawful and valid warrant to search these premises and your electronic devices.”<br />
“On what grounds,” Jack a half second from bursting into his were-panther fursona and ripping the man’s throat out.<br />
“For the attempted murder of Frederick Parker,” the agent getting in Jack’s face; “plus the murder of the court officer accompanying the man.”<br />
“What,” Kenya unable to remain silent any longer; “you are crazy to think Jack had anything to do with that!”<br />
“My lawyer is going to have a field day with this,” Jack snarling; “you are so going to wish you never screwed with me.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“I know this is important director,” Agent Reed speaking in a private windowless room; the door locked and the lights turned off, so no one could see what has going on if there was a camera in place.<br />
“But we need to take great care in dealing with Crawford,” Agent Reed pacing back and forth. In her fursona, if anyone was in the room with her they would see a werewolf; the fur marking her as the arctic wolf variety. Brook Reed&#39;s fur was primarily white; while there was a smattering of black; it was most noticeable on the tip of her tail and the tips of her lupine ears.<br />
“Director you are not listening,” Agent Reed speaking; “Crawford is like us. And he has threatened to expose our kind if arrested,” Agent Reed continuing; “I sent you that report on him the other day, detailing how he is warring with Benton Knight and the elder council of Moon Lake. Yes that report,” Agent Reed  looking exasperated; “you only just received it?”<br />
<br />
Agent Reed on the verge of howling her frustration as the director pauses to read the report while on the phone with her. Hearing his voice trail off and listening as she can hear the man get up; Agent Reed was certain that the subtle click was the sound of a lock being engaged and the rustling was blinds being drawn.<br />
‘Worried that you had to secure the office,’ Agent Reed thinking; ‘you must be shifting into your fursona as well.&#39;<br />
<br />
“Director,” Agent Reed speaking on her phone; “I assured Tachibana that I would handle Jack Crawford personally. Let me do that.”<br />
“It’s out of my paws,” the director sighing; “as we speak, the warrants are being served.”<br />
“I’m aware of that,” Agent Reed responding; “who is serving the warrant?”<br />
“Special Agent Nicholas McVoy,” the director answering; “he is the senior field agent for Seattle and should be handling this matter to begin with…”<br />
“McVoy,” Agent Reed sitting in an empty chair and clearly whining like a wolf; “is going to have his throat ripped out by a pissed off were-panther. The man has no tact,” Agent Reed sighing; “and from what I heard, Jack Crawford has a short fuse when it comes to physical confrontations.”<br />
“Oh fuck,” the director could be heard saying as he realized what could possibly be happening in Seattle.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Calm down Jack,” Kenya doing her best to pull her husband back and whispering in his ear; “don’t do anything we will ALL regret.”<br />
Jack snaps his attention to Kenya and stares at her upon the mention of “ALL”. Understanding what Kenya just said; Jack seethes as he forces the panther within him back. Not wanting to expose the existence of were&#39;s; at least not at this moment. Still angry over what has just transpired; his hands balled into fists in preparation to lash out.<br />
“Listen to your wife,” Special Agent McVoy sneering; “you don’t want us to run her in for suspicion of prostitution.”<br />
<br />
Jack wheels about and decks the man; unconcerned that several agents witnessed him striking the man. Jack was not about to let some uncouth jackass accuse his wife of being a whore; despite the article written about her from the Moon Lake Gazette. An article making the rounds all over the newspapers.<br />
“And now you are under arrest for assaulting a federal agent,” McVoy getting up and looking at a nearby agent; “cuff him!”</p>
