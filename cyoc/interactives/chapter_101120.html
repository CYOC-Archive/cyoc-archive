<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But I would have time to wait?&quot; Marie asked to Jane, looking slightly in awe as she sat back onto the bed.<br />
<br />
It was a different secret from anything she and Jane had ever shared before, and in that Marie felt she understood why Jane had been so cagey on the issue earlier.  There was a great deal of surprise, and before Jane turned into an anthropomorphic cheetah, Marie didn&#39;t entirely believe Jane&#39;s commentary about most of Moon Lake being a were-beast of some kind. Watching the transformation made her friend&#39;s point obvious. A part of Marie was curious, though, about why Jane couldn&#39;t have told her this earlier, as they had been best friends and had kept each other&#39;s secrets as far Marie knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would have time to make a decision,&quot; Jane told her and sat down beside Marie. Her clothing was stretched taught over her body as her feet had lengthened into a digitigrade stance when she transformed, but she was grateful that Marie had responded well, &quot;and thanks for not panicking on me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... you&#39;re my best friend,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;I told you, I&#39;d rather hear about the secret from you than someone I didn&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two traded glances for a moment, and Marie actually found herself marveling at Jane&#39;s form. She was rather athletic looking and while she had a rounded feline muzzle, which was rather short even by feline standards, Marie thought she could still see some of the facial features that made Jane who she was. Her eyes had also become a rather amberish color when she changed. In that, she felt Jane was very beautiful, and her breasts were definitely bigger. In fact, Marie had thought that Jane had been at a D cup in her human form, which was slightly larger than she remembered, but her breasts were definitely even bigger in her were form, though still in the D range. Marie also noticed  Jane twitching her tail slightly behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Jane said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look pretty good,&quot; Marie commented, &quot;Why would you want to hide this from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane frowned, &quot;Mostly because weres and normals don&#39;t have a great history of cooperation... People think were mindless beasts like David in &quot;American Werewolf in London&quot; or satanic monsters like in European folklore. Countless numbers of weres were hunted down in Medieval Europe because of what they were, and a fair number of normals were probably also killed under suspicion of being weres...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s pretty much why Moon Lake was formed,&quot; Jane continued, &quot;some time in the late 1700s or early 1800s... or maybe even earlier, I can&#39;t remember for sure what my roommate told me... Moon Lake&#39;s founders came here and founded their own town as a place for their own safety and their own society...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thus the wagon wheel shaped town?&quot; Marie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can be close nature, yes,&quot; Jane nodded, &quot;and it&#39;s allowed weres and normals to live side by side without trouble, where we can show normals that we aren&#39;t monsters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t, never were,&quot; Marie told her and patted Jane&#39;s back, feeling some very wiry muscle there.<br />
<br />
Jane smiled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re a lesbian now?&quot; Marie asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... no, I&#39;m still straight,&quot; Jane answered, &quot;while werecheetahs are all female, we aren&#39;t necessarily lesbians. That would be with normal werecats that are at least bi, if not outright lesbians... In fact, when I found out that the waivers I signed when I came to college here weren&#39;t a joke was when I walked in on my roommate having sex with her boyfriend...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t...!?&quot; Marie actually giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... yeah... I didn&#39;t know the whole &quot;sock on the door&quot; thing,&quot; Jane answered, &quot;though it was more embarrassing for me than it was for her. And by that time, I was starting to fall in love with the town anyway... so I was already thinking about moving here, which meant that I&#39;d need to become a were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; Marie began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t force being a were on normals in the sense that we just attack people,&quot; Jane explained, &quot;but weres have feared discovery... so when a family moves to Moon Lake, by law at least one member of the family must become a were in order to keep the secret. Those who aren&#39;t living here sign waivers to keep the secret, and since the college students may not always see were activity... the waivers have been sort of laughed of... In fact I did laugh it off...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until you walked in on your roommate,&quot; Marie teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Jane answered, &quot;but... since I did decide to move here and would have to become a were... I contacted my roommate and she did go through with my transformation... which was a... a lesbian experience, but that&#39;s more because there are no male werecheetahs... As I said... Moon Lake is comfortable with same sex relationships and all single gender were-beasts will be at least willing to help normals that want to become that specific were-beast... provided they are all the right gender... So, I&#39;m still straight but given certain circumstances... bi-willing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I&#39;d need to become a were,&quot; Marie said slowly, more intrigued than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I can&#39;t be sure on... while you&#39;re living with me... you might not have to as on a technicality, I&#39;m already the &quot;family&quot; were,&quot; Jane said slowly, &quot;but even if not... you will be given time to make a choice... and if you WANT to be a were... you&#39;ll also be given time to think it over as to what were you&#39;d want to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And all weres are built like you now?&quot; Marie asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically... though it depends on the specific were-beast,&quot; Jane answered, &quot;all females have wide hips and a generous bosom... but it can still vary. You can get a handbook at City Hall if you want, that&#39;ll have more in depth info on every were-beast species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Marie smiled at that, mostly at curiosity on things. Jane wasn&#39;t some half-furred slobbering beast, and she privately thought she actually looked very good as a werecheetah. And if that was the secret that Moon Lake had, it was a secret she&#39;d like to learn more about and perhaps even be part of, but she would like to know more about Moon Lake&#39;s weres. &quot;That sounds good... something to learn about all the different were-beasts there are...&quot;</p>
