<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan awoke, at first thinking it all was nothing more then a horrible dream he'd been having; one that involved his sister, the notion that she was witch and that she had cursed him. Thinking that the last had all been a nightmare, Dan rolled out of bed, and headed for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
There, without really giving it much thought, he sat down on the toilet to pee, making sure his tail was not drooping into the toilet. It was only as he was finishing that he paused and told himself, &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; and then quickly stood and looked into the mirror that was hanging on the bathroom wall. And what he saw made him want to scream out, but at the same time confirmed that it had not been a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Twitching back and forth behind him was the white tail he had grown last night when he was at his grandparents. The sight of the light purple nightgown, which clashed horribly with his penis and testicles, confirmed that he was indeed wearing clothes that where suitable for a girl. But this wasn't the only thing he noticed.<br />
<br />
Where his hair used to be was now short white fur. Wanting to cry out, he ran a hair through it, noted how soft it was and instead turned and slowly left the bathroom, passing Kat in the hallway, who commented, &quot;Nice hair, sis,&quot; and then began to chuckle in a real cold tone as she headed for the bathroom while Dan made his way back to his room.<br />
<br />
Inside, he took off the nightgown and standing naked in his room, he looked around. Except for the fact that it was painted whitish pink, it still looked like his room. Looking into a full body mirror, he took in his appearance, noted that he looked strange with short white fur on top of his head and then walked to his dresser.<br />
<br />
From it, he took a long sleeve white turtle neck, a denim pair of pants with a hole in the back for his tail, another pair of Bobby socks and after a hesitating, Dan took a pair of the underwear that was rolled up next to the socks. Sitting down on his bed, he began to slowly get dressed, hating what was happening, unable to think a way to get out of the situation he'd been put into and hating, above all, the way the panties felt and how tight they where against his skin.<br />
<br />
Outside his room, he could hear his mom talking to Kat. Something about wanting to her to remain home today. Dressed, he left and went downstairs for breakfast, greeting mom and dad, who still didn't show any signs that anything was wrong. After breakfast, he collected his coat, shoes and back pack and headed for school.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
His mom was livid at what Kat had done. Not only had she cast a spell on her brother that was slowly transforming him, but she had also cast a spell on her own parents to make sure they would not see what was happening, thinking that everything was normal. Luckily, she, Dan and Kat's mom, had set up spells so that people like Kat could not alter her memories. Especially when it came to her very own children.<br />
<br />
Dan, now Cathy, left for school, while Kat stayed upstairs, preparing herself for the day. Their mom cleared the table kissed her husband goodbye and then went upstairs to confront her daughter.<br />
<br />
Kat was sitting in front of her vanity, not paying attention. It wasn't until her mother walked in and whispered something. Suddenly Kat found herself standing and then turning around, while her wand and book appeared in her mothers hand. Her mom whispered something again and the two artifacts disappeared.<br />
<br />
Looking at Kat, her mother spat out, &quot;You knew the rules. You changed your brother, put a spell on me and a spell on your father. Abnormal spells. Spells that are forbidden. What you did was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat wanted to argue, but found that her mouth didn't work. She wanted to go to her mother, but found her feet didn't work either. From across the room, her mother continued. &quot;Balance must be kept. You upset the balance by what you did. I had a son and daughter. Now I have two daughters, one who is probably not going to be human. Something that excludes her from the possibility of ever inheriting  the family trait. You wish to plead your case, to beg,&quot; Kat nodded, fear spreading across her face.<br />
<br />
Her mom closed her eyes and shook her head and said, &quot;But you didn't give your brother a chance, did you? So, for punishment, you shall, for starters, be excluded from the family trait. Next, you shall take your brother's place, becoming the male of the family. But this transformation, this transition into being male, will only occur after Cathy has completely transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat wanted to cry out, to protest, but she was unable to and her mother continued. &quot;I think, for the time being, it is best to confine you. Perhaps into something that gives you a better look into what your brother is going through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mom raised her arms and a wand appeared. Quickly she began to chant. As she did so, a wind began to pick up. Items began to whirl around the room and Kat began to bend and twist, a distorted look appearing across her body and face. Faster and faster her mother chanted and the suddenly there was soft popping noise and where Kat's room used to be was a sewing room. Where Kat used to be was a plush doll of about ten inches tall.<br />
<br />
Picking up the doll, she listened as Kat whined, pleaded and begged. Ignoring the noises Kat made in her mind, knowing she was the only one who could hear her former daughter, she took the doll and placed it in Cathy's room, knowing her new daughter would love it.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that all had been set right, the path that was being followed was the correct one, that no one - not even Cathy or her husband - would know of Kat, the mother of now one daughter - for the moment - nodded and then decided that she had some errands to run.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Cathy sat in class, passing notes with Tanya and Anni and finding she was actually liking the activity. In front of her, the second grade teacher, Mr. Petty, talked on and on about some sort of math problem. As he talked, Cathy noticed, as she passed a note to Tanya, that for some reason that her ears not only itched, but they also kind of burned a little. Unable to do anything, she sat there, thinking to herself, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as she took a note from Anni.</p>
