<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a quick breakfast with Ryan’s parents, Connor went upstairs to Ryan’s room to gather the few things that he brought with him the previous night. He grabbed the clothes that he had hastily taken last night. He couldn’t help but smile softly as he put the clothes back into his bag, thinking about the wonderful night he’d had with Ryan. He hoped that they would get to have another night together very soon. Once he had all his things, Connor took his bag downstairs and found Ryan waiting for him by the front door. <br />
<br />
“You got everything you need?” Ryan asked, gesturing to Connor’s bag. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m fairly certain I did,” Connor responded. “If I forgot something, I’ll text you so I can swing by and get it.”<br />
<br />
“Works for me,” Ryan said. He turned and opened the front door, holding it open for Connor. As Connor walked through the door.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be back in a few minutes mom and dad,” Ryan called into the house as he began to walk out the front door. <br />
<br />
“Be back soon Ryan,” his dad called back. “We need to work out an official welcome for your friend into our pride.” Ryan shut the front door and turned to face Connor, giving him a warm smile and offering him his hand. Connor’s face turned red, though he graciously accepted his boyfriend’s hand.<br />
<br />
~     ~     ~     ~     ~<br />
<br />
Diana Ross sat in her living room, drinking her morning coffee. She had gotten up earlier than she normally would have to check if Connor had gotten home after she and her husband had fallen asleep. Unfortunately for her, Connor was not in his room when she went to check. While she knew that he had probably just fallen asleep at Ryan’s, Diana was still a little concerned when Connor didn’t return before his curfew. <br />
<br />
The sound of someone coming down the stairs caused Diana to turn her head to see who was coming downstairs. It wasn’t long until her husband Kent walked into view, still looking a bit tired.<br />
<br />
“Still not home yet?” Kent asked as he walked into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
“No, not yet,” Diana responded. She could hear the sound of a cabinet being opened coming from the kitchen, followed by the sound of the coffee maker brewing a new cup of coffee. A few minutes later, Kent walked out of the kitchen and into the living room, cup of coffee in hand. He sat down on the couch next to his wife and took a sip of his coffee. <br />
<br />
“You don’t have to be so worried,” he said, looking at his wife. “Connor probably lost track of time, and he did say that there was the possibility that it would take the whole night.”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know,” Diana said with a soft sigh. “But I just can’t help but worry a little. It’s just not like Connor to miss his curfew.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not like you didn’t miss your curfew when you were his age,” Kent said with a slight chuckle. “Remember our senior prom?” A smile appeared on Diana’s face as she started chuckling. <br />
<br />
“How could I ever forget?” she said. “You convinced me to leave the dance early so we could go stargazing. I fell asleep in your arms, and when we woke up, it was already morning. I’m still impressed that you managed to get me home before my parents got up.”<br />
<br />
“I did go over the speed limit a bit,” Kent admitted. “But that’s beside the point. My point is that love makes you lose track of time. You and I are both guilty of it, and Connor has probably done the same.”<br />
<br />
Diana sighed and nodded her head. “You’re right,” she said, giving her husband a kiss. “I suppose that was something I hadn’t fully considered.”<br />
<br />
The sound of the front door opening made the two of them turn their heads to see who was coming in. Connor walked inside and saw his parents sitting on the couch together. <br />
<br />
“Hey mom...hey dad…” the young man said, a hint of remorse in his voice. <br />
<br />
“You missed your curfew last night,” Kent said. “We agreed that you would text us and let us know if things were going to last the whole night.” Just then, Ryan walked in behind Connor. <br />
<br />
“Mr and Mrs Ross, please don’t be mad at your son,” he said, moving to stand next to Connor. “I was so excited to be able to welcome Connor into the Were society that I neglected to check with him to see if he had to be home by a certain time. If this is anyone’s fault, it’s mine.”<br />
<br />
“There’s no need to cover for him, Ryan,” Diana spoke up. She turned and looked at Connor before continuing. “Normally your father and I would punish you for being home so far past your curfew without giving us so much as a text to let us know that you’re okay. However, we decided that we’ll let it slide. You both had a big night, and you were bound to lose track of time at some point.”<br />
<br />
Connor sighed in relief. “Thanks mom. Thanks dad. I promise this won’t happen again.”</p>
