<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">15 minutes later Max walked out of the bathroom. A towel covered her up as she walked towards the bedroom, in search for some clothes to put on. She opened the door and saw Hanna, with only her underwear on, rush past her, running to the bathroom. &quot;Good morning Ha-, are you alright?&quot; Max asked. &quot;Not now, Max.&quot; Hanna answered. Hanna ran into the bathroom, locking the door behind her. &quot;Strange...&quot; Max thought, and she closed the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
Hanna was still shocked after what happened just a while ago. The mirror wasn&#39;t seethrough, because of the moisture after Max&#39; shower. Hanna quickly grabbed a towel off the rack and tried cleaning the mirror until she could see her reflection properly again. Everything seemed alright. She looked at her front and at her back, her curves showing because she barely had anything on. Hanna then proceeded to slowly lower her panties. Standing bent over she still saw nothing. She turned her back towards her mirror and turned her head to look at her ass.<br />
<br />
Something was terribly wrong. She didn&#39;t have an asshole. It was just... gone. She turned towards the mirror again, looking at her front, which wasn&#39;t showing anything of her pee hole. She bit her finger to not cry it out, she was incredibly confused. She saw a hand mirror lying on the counter and picked it up. With trembling hands she lowered it towards her groin. <br />
<br />
Hanna weeped at the sight of her womanhood being gone as well. It was as if they had just disappeared... &quot;What in the hell happened?&quot; She thought. She was startled when she heard a knock on the bathroom door, it was Max. &quot;Hanna, I&#39;m going to eat breakfast, would you care to join in?&quot; She said. Hanna quickly dried her tears with the towel she also used for cleaning the bathroom mirror and answered, &quot;Yeah, sure. But first let me get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hanna quickly did her hair and put on some make up. Afterwards she grabbed the clothes she had selected out of her bedroom and put those on. The table was set up with two plates, a few loafs of bread, and something to put on them. &quot;Hanna,&quot; Max then began. Hanna looked up to her blue eyes &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Max continued. Hanna sat down in front of the table, putting a careful smile on her face and answered: &quot;Yes I&#39;m fine, what about you?&quot; Max noticed Hanna&#39;s worries, but just ignored it, as she didn&#39;t want to have any further discussion with her. She faced down at the food on the table and continued her chores. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;m on point. My bus goes in an hour, so I&#39;ve got all time&quot; Max joked.<br />
<br />
Max was always quicker at eating breakfast than Hanna was, thus she was already doing her dishes as Hanna just finished her breakfast. Hanna was sitting uncomfortably, fidgeting and closing her legs tightly. She had to go to the toilet, but had no idea how. Max looked behind her and Hanna quickly tried to stop her fidgeting. &quot;If you have to go pee or something, the toilet right over there.&quot; Hanna blushed at that and looked away, while she stood up and walked to the white door between their bathroom and bedroom. She locked the door behind her, undid herself from her pants and sat down. <br />
<br />
Hanna knew she couldn&#39;t pee like this. She probably would die, because her pee hole had just vanished, something would probably happen to her bladder, like it would rip open or something. Yet, she still felt the necessary desire to pee. She was sitting on the toilet bowl already, it wasn&#39;t like she&#39;d pee her pants right now. She tried to, but didn&#39;t dare it to come out. Hanna was just too nervous. If she were Max she&#39;d just have ignored this feeling. She stood up from the toilet bowl and put her pants on again. She flushed, trying to make Max think she&#39;d actually done her business and walked out into the living room.<br />
<br />
Hanna saw Max was still doing her dishes. She stood still in the middle of the room, suddenly upright and regretted not just going to the toilet like usual. She was about to pee her pants.<br />
<br />
Max dropped the plate she was cleaning in the soapy water and looked down. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; She cried out. A wet stain was growing and she looked at Hanna, leaning against the wall behind her. She had just gone out of the toilet, so it meant it was free. While the stain was spreading, she rushed to the toilet. &quot;Excuse me!&quot; She cried. <br />
<br />
Hanna looked at Max running to the toilet in just split second, and saw a glimpse of a dark stain on her roommate&#39;s pants. Her eyelids shot up as she looked down, meanwhile she also tried to stop the flow. Her blue jeans were completely dry. Max, now on the toilet seat, had pulled down her pants, but now the sudden flow of urine had stopped, leaving a wet stain and a stench on Max&#39; jeans and panties. &quot;What happened there?&quot; Max muttered. She carefully put on her pants and peeked out of the small room she was standing in. Hanna was sitting on the bench in the living room, her back turned towards Max.<br />
<br />
Hanna was almost certain of what was going on, and had turned her back towards Max, trying to hear what she was going to do. She still wasn&#39;t done peeing, as she&#39;d managed to stop the flow from earlier, luckily. Just trying to find out what was happening, she started to pee again as she heard Max run into the bathroom. As her flow started, Hanna heard Max yelp.<br />
<br />
Max cupped her crotch area and waited for the flow to stop. She suddenly stood there in the kitchen, peeing. She didn&#39;t have to go to the toilet seconds before. Even while she was peeing, she didn&#39;t feel like she actually was! Max blushed and felt ashamed of herself. &quot;Have I gone incontinent?&quot; She asked herself. Max rushed to the bathroom past Hanna, holding new pants and jeans under her arm and redressed.<br />
<br />
She was startled when she heard a knock on the bathroom door, it was Hanna. &quot;What do you want?&quot; Max fiercely asked. &quot;Max, calm down,&quot; Hanna answered, &quot;I think something strange has happened, we need to talk.&quot;</p>
