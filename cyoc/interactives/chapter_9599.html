<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul had been in the shower when he had begun shrinking.  It was imperceptable as he rubbed the soap over his body, and let the steaming hot stream of water pound his aching muscles.  He heard a popping sound as his shoulder joint respond to the therapeutic ministrations of the massage action of the shower head.  The stream seemed to rise up from the middle of his back to his shoulders, and now started working on his neck.  Paul figured that the boys must have found a new setting on the shower head.  He was quite pleased until he turned to readjust the shower head, only to find it 17 inches higher than it should have been.  He stared the walls of the tub now came almost up to his waist.  Paul DeSoto struggle to turn off the shower valves.  He had to use both hands. He slid the enclosure door open, and looked at the wall of porcelain that now came up to his ribs.  He swallowed hard, and braced himself vaulting over the wall of the tub and landing on the waiting towel.  <br />
<br />
He closed his eyes.  He had to be daydreaming.  He took a deep breath, and opened his eyes.  He was even shorter.  The wall of the tub was now over his head.  He looked up miserably at the unreachable towels, and then decided to roll around to dry himself on the floor towel before calling for assistance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brett!  Bryan!&quot; he called.  The door was ajar and started to move.  Tiny Paul advanced toward the opening door over the 1 inch tiled floor, and shivered realizing that they seemed more like 2 foot tiles now.  He must be about 3 inches tall he deduced.  <br />
<br />
&quot;MIAOW&quot; roared a voice from the hallway, and a paw forced its way into the opening.  <br />
<br />
Paul DeSoto froze in his tracks.  He knew all about cats and small mammals.  Even if it didn't want to eat him, play at his current size probably would kill him. He looked toward the old water heater cabinet next to the bathroom window.  He'd been meaning to move it outside for years, now he was glad he hadn't.  The old door hung open as the old boiler made creaking noises boiling up more hot water.   Paul sprinted the 24 yards from where he stood crossing the 72 tiles, as the door creaked open to admit the deadly feline.<br />
<br />
He heard the soft pad of velvet paws and click of claws on the hard tile. He dove into the cabinet and dashed behind the towering metal water chamber as the cat leapt.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Miaowrrr!&quot; roared the cat reaching with its paws.  The deadly claws gleamed as they extended from the huge paw.  Paul slipped back into the corner behind the water heater just out of the monster's reach.<br />
<br />
The cat tried both sides of the water heater, but the cabinet was too small.    A loud bell tolled.  It took Paul a minute to realize the loud bell was really his door bell.  The cat knew and paused debating whether to investigate the door or continue its quest for the tiny creature hiding behind the water heater.  The tiny creature won, and it returned to prowl and claw at Paul's hidey hole. Then Paul heard a voice thunder in the distance.   The cat paused and moved away.  Was Paul saved?  He started to edge toward the opening, but he was cautious.  He picked up a spent match stick that had been left next to the water heater, and tossed it toward the opening.  Fur flew and the creature pounced on it.<br />
<br />
Paul drew a deep breath, and edged closer to the wall. Then he slumped down, he knew about cat and mouse.  He was under seige. He frowned as he realized how dusty and grimy it was back behind the water heater.  The tiny naked man needed another shower.<br />
<br />
It seemed like an eternity, then Paul bumped his toes against the outer hull of the water heater tank. He hadn't notice his feet shifting.  He shook his head trying to fathom what had happened. It had to be a dream. Bang his knees hit the water heater tank, but they were still up against his chest.  In fact they were pushing harder against his chest.  The shrinking must be wearing off, he thought relieved. Then he realized his legs would soon crush his lungs if he didn't get up.  He managed to squeeze himself upright, and nade for the exit.  He was still too small for his liking if he had to battle that cat. He edged around the side of the waterheater and found he was too big.  He inhaled and pressed himself flat against the wall, but the space between the water heater and the wall on this side was too narrow.  He managed to unwedge himself, and headed to the other side of the water heater.  If he had headed there first he would have escaped, but in those few seconds he grew too large for that exit.  He sighed.  He went and stood in the corner next to the large opening.  The cat's claws could reach there, but if he kept growing it would be the only place he wouldn't get crushed.  He hoped.  He decided as he reached the three foot high mark to call for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt heard his cry, and headed toward the bathroom.  That's the direction the cat had come from he thought.  At least one of them was still alive, he thought relieved.  He clutched the wand tightly in his hand.  When he reached the bathroom door, he called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me!  Is that you, Brett or Bryan?  You won't believe what's been happening to me! I think I may need you to shut off the water and get my wrench.  I'm trapped behind the water heater.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. DeSoto?&quot; inquired a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's there?&quot; Mr. DeSoto now sounded nervous and embarrassed.  Where were his sons?  How would he explain to a stranger that he was naked and trapped behind a water heater.  The hot metal pressed against his body. He closed his eyes again.<br />
<br />
He heard whispering over the creaking old water heater's noisy boiling.  Then the pressusre on his chest lessened.  OH,no! he thought, I'm shrinking again!</p>
