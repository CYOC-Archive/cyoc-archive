<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up to sunlight streaming into the bedroom. You feel vulnerable because you can't mist if you needed to. You look over to Megan to see if she was up yet. She wasn't but she would be in a few minutes. You get out of bed and use the bathroom. When you get back into the bedroom you go stand by Megan waiting for her to wake up. After a minute she starts to stir.<br />
<br />
Megan slowly opens her eyes and says &quot;Looks like he killed you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not dead Megan&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Megan asked. &quot;I was shot you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason was able to turn you before you died&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means that I'm a vampire now&quot; Megan gleefully said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you don't have to be so depressed about it&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just so happy that I'm a vampire now&quot; Megan said. She looks down at the dressing and says &quot;This hurts. I thought that vampires weren't suppose to feel pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we can feel pain&quot; you say. &quot;Once the wound closes the pain will quickly fade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When will this wound close?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it should close once the bullet is removed&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;When will the bullet be removed?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be soon&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Violet, do vampires need to use the bathroom?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't know about other vampires but we still need to use the bathroom&quot; you say. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I need to go&quot; Megan said. &quot;Could you help me up and to the bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I'll help you&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
When you come back into the bedroom you see Sarah standing by the bed Megan was in. &quot;Good morning&quot; she said. &quot;How are you feeling Megan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than the pain I'm feeling ok&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll take care of the pain now&quot; Sarah said. &quot;If you'll lay down on the bed I'll dig that bullet out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You notice that there is a tray with various surgical instruments on one of the nightstands. You see that Megan is looking at it with an apprehensive expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sooner we get that bullet out the sooner the pain will fade&quot; Sarah said seeing Megan's expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to hurt isn't it?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it will&quot; Sarah said, &quot;but we need to get that bullet out. You see, it's a silver bullet and as long as it's in your body you will be in pain and the wound won't close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I don't have much of a choice&quot; Megan said. She laid down on the bed and closed her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to take off your bra before we begin&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
Megan sat back up and took off her bra then laid back down. Sarah grabbed a scalpel and proceeded to make a small incision to open the bullet wound a little more. Megan's face scrunched up in pain as Sarah kept making the incision deeper. Finally Sarah picked up something that looked like a cross between pliers and scissors with the end at an angle. She stuck it in the incision and after a little bit pulled out the bullet. As soon as the bullet was removed the incision and bullet wound closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's definitely a silver bullet&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You can put your bra back on. Tanya brought some of your clothes from your house so you can get dressed. Violet, you'll need to borrow some of Megan's clothes for today until we go shopping. I'll be downstairs when you girls are ready to come down. Violet can answer some of your questions Megan.&quot; Sarah picked up the tray and and left.<br />
<br />
Megan picked up a suitcase that was beside the bed and opened it. &quot;Come pick out what you want to wear Aunt Violet&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
You go over and pick out a short denim skirt and a light blue top.<br />
<br />
As you and Megan were changing Megan says &quot;I'm feeling a strange thirst. What is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be your thirst for blood&quot; you say. &quot;I don't know if Sarah has any blood here for you to drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I have to drink blood?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes&quot; you say, &quot;you are a vampiress now. Did you think that you wouldn't need to drink blood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to drink blood&quot; Megan said, &quot;that's just gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you don't have to drink blood if you want a slow, painful death&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want that&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you'll have to drink blood&quot; you say. &quot;You'll enjoy drinking blood once you do. I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I'll enjoy it&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll change your mind&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so&quot; Megan said. &quot;I guess I could force myself to drink blood if I have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't need to force yourself&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to get off this subject&quot; Megan said. &quot;What I want to talk about now is my feelings for Jason. I still love him but it's like my love for my father instead of for my boyfriend. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You figured she would ask this question sooner or later. You take a deep breath and say &quot;That's because Jason is your father now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He can't be my father&quot; Megan said, &quot;he's just one year older than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't matter&quot; you say. &quot;Jason turned you so that makes him your father. It's the same thing with me and Sarah. My love for Sarah changed from that of boyfriend/girlfriend to mother/daughter. It's probably because of the type of vampire we are that our feelings change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you called Grandma Mom&quot; Megan said. &quot;Why would you do that if Sarah is your mother now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my mother took care of me for most of my life&quot; you say. &quot;I still have my love for my mother and that won't change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So because Jason turned me into a vampire, he's my father now?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's crazy&quot; Megan says, &quot;he's 14. How will people react if I call Jason Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't call Jason Dad&quot; you say. &quot;I don't call Sarah Mom and the others in the clan don't either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are vampires that are physically older than the ones that turned them&quot; you say. &quot;The physical age has nothing to do with vampire families.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan sits down one the bed and says &quot;Well, it seems like Jason got his vampire daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it's any consolation, Jason wanted to wait until you were about 30&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;So he was planning on turning me all along?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he was&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's why he told me that&quot; Megan said. &quot;I guess I need to get use to Jason being my father. There is another question that I need to ask. How do I get my fangs out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have some new muscles in the roof of your mouth&quot; you say. &quot;To extend your fangs you just flex those muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it&quot; you say, &quot;go ahead and try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few seconds Megan smiled. You could only assume that she had succeeded in extending her fangs. She tried to say something but you couldn't understand what she was trying to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to retract your fangs before you talk&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
After a couple of seconds Megan asked &quot;Why do I need to retract them to speak? Last night you still had your fangs extended when you spoke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can speak with your fangs extended but you need to learn how&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I do that?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just need to practice speaking with your fangs extended&quot; you say. &quot;What were you trying to say before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was trying to say that this was tight&quot; Megan said. &quot;When do I get to learn to turn to mist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably tonight when the sun goes down&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Megan's eyes went wide and she said &quot;I didn't notice that we're in direct sunlight. Why aren't we dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only way we can die is if we starve&quot; you say, &quot;that means not drinking blood for three months. All sunlight does is robs us of our ability to transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that bites&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let's go downstairs&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
When you get downstairs you find Sarah, Tanya, Alice, Jason, and Brian sitting at a dinning table with Blade and Dagger. You go over and sit down next to Brian while Megan sits next to Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are these two?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Blade&quot; Sarah said indicating Blade, &quot;and Dagger. Blade, Dagger, this is Megan, Jason's daughter. You must be thirsty Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be right back&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Blade, why don't you tell Violet and Megan what you just told us.&quot; With that Sarah got up from the table and went to get Megan something to drink.<br />
<br />
While Sarah was gone Blade said &quot;We were able to learn what evidence Alucard gave to the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's evidently a video tape of Danny murdering the girl Dagger found and of him entering your clan house&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't he stop it?&quot; you ask. &quot;He is a vampire hunter after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We asked that same question&quot; Blade said. &quot;He said that he took it from a vampiress he slayed. He theorized that the vampires made that tape for their future viewing pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense&quot; you say. &quot;It was probably made by a vampire clan that wants to see our clan destroyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well those vampires would probably say that your clan gives vampires a bad name&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure Alucard would say you and Dagger give vampire hunters a bad name&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that they're vampire hunters?&quot; Megan asked with fear in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry&quot; you say, &quot;they're on our side. It's Alucard that you have to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this the same Alucard that has been talking to Grandpa&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so&quot; you say. &quot;This is going to rally more vampire hunters to Alucard's side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those that don't know your clan that well will probably believe that Alucard has the right idea about all vampires&quot; Dagger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you find out the description of the vampire Alucard slayed to get this tape?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;That shouldn't be a problem&quot; Blade said. &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a hunch&quot; you say. Your hunch is that the vampire Alucard slayed is the girl that fingered Harry as killing her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I know what you're thinking&quot; Dagger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's not jump to conclusions&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
Sarah came back in carrying a glass of blood, sat it down in front of Megan and said &quot;Here you go Megan. You have to drink it through your fangs. Just extend them and think about drinking through your fangs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to drink that Megan&quot; Tanya said in a stern voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to but Aunt Violet said I have to&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you don't&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she does Tanya&quot; you say. &quot;Megan is a vampire now and she needs to drink blood. You gave Jason permission to turn Megan into a vampire to save her life. If she doesn't drink blood she will die a slow, painful death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My little girl is not a vampire&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a vampire Mom&quot; Megan said. &quot;I have fangs and a strange thirst. I can clearly smell the blood and it's like it's calling to me. I have to drink it. I don't want to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want you to die&quot; Tanya said. &quot;Go ahead and drink it if you must.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan raised the glass and started drinking the blood through her fangs. She lowered the glass and said &quot;I'm really surprised that I like the taste of blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My little girl is no longer my little girl&quot; Tanya said with her head down. &quot;What is there left for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still your little girl Mom&quot; Megan said. &quot;I still love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not a vampire&quot; Tanya said. &quot;I can't teach you anything about being a vampire. Once this situation is resolved I won't see you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not true&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Megan can visit you anytime and you can visit her anytime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're worlds apart now&quot; Tanya said. &quot;It's the same with Violet now. I lost my brother and now my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't lose us&quot; you say, &quot;we're just different now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did lose you&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were happy that I was a girl now last night&quot; you say. &quot;Why are you so gloomy now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't be a true part of your world and I'll never understand it unless I become a vampire&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may be able to accommodate that when this is over&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did the moratorium pass in the council?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we didn't get to vote on it because you weren't in attendance and Dale had insisted that for that everyone needed to be present&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if the moratorium wasn't even voted on then we can turn people during this time&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right about that&quot; Sarah said. &quot;So we could turn Tanya if she so chooses. Would you like to be a vampire Tanya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I would&quot; Tanya said. &quot;Could you make me 15?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To answer your question truthfully I need to know your sexual orientation&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I would be bi curious&quot; Tanya said. &quot;I've often wondered what having sex with another woman would be like. Why did you need to know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because only vampiresses can choose the age and gender that the new vampire becomes&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I get it&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now, if you're willing to try sex with a woman, we can make you 15.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm willing to try that&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm bi so I'll turn you&quot; Sarah said. &quot;That way you'll be sisters with Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm already her sister&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother gave birth to both of you and that made you brother and sister&quot; Sarah said. &quot;When I turn you, it will be like you're reborn. In essence I will be your mother also. This is the way vampire families in our clan work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I understand&quot; Tanya said. &quot;There's one thing though, Violet was adopted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She never told me that&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think it was important&quot; you say. &quot;My birth mother died when I was three and my biological dad was nowhere to be found.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn't there some family to take you in after your birth mother died?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evidently not&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;When were you adopted?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was when I was four&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did you find out you were adopted?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was 18 when I found out&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you find out?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mother thought that it was time to tell me&quot; you say. &quot;She was getting remarried at that time and she wanted me to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe that you didn't tell me this&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, I didn't think it was important&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I get it&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now if your ready Tanya, we'll go upstairs and I'll turn you. Megan, Violet, there's breakfast in the kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah and Tanya went upstairs while you and Megan ate breakfast.</p>
