<br />
“Ty! Ty! Look at that!” Allen shouted, as he pointed to a large poster, which was hanging from the large board. “We can get a booth at the Orange County Fairgrounds for only seventy-five bucks!”<br />
<br />
Allen was a shrewd business man, who was always looking for a new way to earn a fast buck. He knew about Ty’s ability to change people, and he figured he could use his help in promoting his booth at the fair.<br />
<br />
“Why would you want to rent a booth at the fair?” Ty asked.<br />
<br />
“I have a badge machine! We can sell buttons for three bucks each and make a killing at fair!” Allen cheered, as he continued to read the details of the event.<br />
<br />
“But… How are we going to get people to come to our booth?” Ty asked him. “There will be over a hundred booths at the fair!”<br />
<br />
“Listen! Almost ten-thousand people visit the fair every day! If we rent a booth for three days, we can make a few hundred bucks in just one weekend!” Allen continued. “And when it comes to getting people to come to our booth…”<br />
<br />
Allen turned to face Ty, and rested his hands on Ty’s shoulders. He stared at him with an evil grin.<br />
<br />
“It will be your job to get the people to come to our booth! I’m counting on you to take care of that!” he told Ty.<br />
<br />
“Ummm… I can get a giant to direct people to our booth!” Ty pondered.<br />
<br />
“One won’t be enough. We’ll need at least two! One will cover the southern part of the fairgrounds; the other covers the northern part. Who did you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
“I can ask Ryan! The kid is huge! He’s a giant muscle kid! Kids love to talk to him!” Ty cheered.<br />
<br />
“Well, I need one more giant!” Allen observed. “Can’t you make someone grow?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, I can! But, who?” Ty wondered out loud, as they continued to stroll down the hallway at the school.<br />
<br />
“Ahha!” Allen shouted. “Look over there! On the basketball court…”<br />
<br />
Ty and Allen noticed that Peter was on the basketball court, which was facing the outer fence, which surrounded the school grounds. <br />
<br />
“Cousin Peter!” Ty grinned. “Of course! Allen, you’re a genius!”<br />
<br />
“Wait till next Friday! I’ll reserve a booth for us. You take care of Peter, before we head off to the fairgrounds. I’ll get the badge machine and the parts. You just need to take care of Ryan and Peter!” Allen said. Both Allen and Ty gave each other a high-five, before they boarded the school bus so they could go home.<br />
<br />
It was Friday afternoon. School had just let out, and Ty had just arrived home from school. He ran up to Ryan’s bedroom, and asked Ryan to come with him and help out at the fair. Ryan was more than happy to help out, and agreed to be at the fair all weekend long! All Ty needed to do now, was to take care of Peter!<br />
<br />
“Rats! Peter’s not home! Where is he at right now?” Ty asked Ryan, the giant muscle boy.<br />
<br />
“Peter’s at the park shooting hoops!” the 25-foot, giant, ebony muscle boy said to Ty. “He was going to play a few games with the guys in the park after school…”<br />
<br />
“Alright! I’m going to the park. I’ll be right back… Hopefully, with Peter!” Ty chuckled, as he walked out the door. He hopped on his scooter and cruised down the street to the large park, where the familiar basketball court was located.<br />
<br />
Ty walked up to the basketball court and hid behind the building where the restrooms were located. The court was outdoors, and Peter was sitting on the bench. The bench had a canopy fastened to it, so he was still sitting in the shade.<br />
<br />
“I want Peter to start growing bigger and more muscular, as soon as he’s in the sun! The growth should stop as soon as he’s gained exactly three-hundred pounds of muscle!” Ty whispered, calling on his power to change Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter was there all by himself. None of the other basketball players had arrived yet. When he finally got up, he strolled across the court, dribbling the ball as he walked towards the hoop.<br />
<br />
He began to feel a strange tingling in his body, but he ignored it for now.<br />
<br />
When he stood right on the free throw line, he dribbled the ball three times, before he made his first shot. The ball bounced off the backboard and went through the hoop! As soon as the ball bounced off the court directly under the hoop, Peter started to walk towards the pole, that the hoop was attached too.<br />
<br />
The tingling feeling increased when he was standing directly under the hot, burning sun. He started to sweat, and his muscles began to grow dramatically!<br />
<br />
“Hey… What’s going on?” Peter asked, as he looked down. “Am I growing taller?”<br />
<br />
Peter suddenly shot up several inches! He was standing 6 foot 3 inches, and he continued to grow! He was passing 6’4”, 6’5”, 6’6”…<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! I’m growing!” he exclaimed. He looked down at his legs, and realized that his legs and torso had become longer.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his muscles began to expand as well. His tights grew thicker, his arms were suddenly longer, and his chest started to expand, making his shoulders wider.<br />
<br />
“Aaaah! I’m getting bigger!” he shouted!<br />
<br />
Peter was now standing about 7 feet tall, when all his muscles began to inflate like balloons, which had air pumped in them! His feet grew so big, that his sneakers tore apart, revealing his enlarged feet! His legs were as thick as the stumps of oak trees, with layers of muscle and long veins covering them like strands of rope.<br />
<br />
“What is this? What’s happening to me?” he gasped, as his body continued to grow.<br />
<br />
His pectorals grew like beach balls, forming large spheres of muscle on his chest. His arms were as thick as the pillars of a building. His shoulders widened, while his calves inflated like two footballs, which were implanted in his mighty, muscular legs.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God! I’m huge!” he shouted, as his jean shorts tore in half. His quads had grown so much, that the jeans could no longer contain them. He was still wearing a tank top, but the clothing began to fit very, very tight around his ever-expanding chest.<br />
<br />
Moments later, there was a loud tear! The fabric ripped in two, with the tear starting at the top of the shirt, and ripping the fabric clear to the bottom. His shoulders and his expanded back ripped the shirt at other places as well, and the tank top just hung from his shoulders while it was torn to shreds like sheets of paper that had been pulled through a paper shredder.<br />
<br />
Peter walked off the court and sat down on the bench. As soon as he was in the shade, the growth had stopped. He looked down at his legs and arms, and he realized that he was huge!<br />
<br />
“I wonder who’s doing this?” he pondered.<br />
<br />
As soon as he stood up and walked back to the hoop, his growth continued as his body was exposed to the rays of the burning sun, which was right overhead.<br />
<br />
“No! Not again!” he shouted, as he felt his muscles while they continued to grow even bigger! Within moments, he was a massive muscle man, standing seven feet tall! That’s when Ty came out of hiding, and casually strolled over to his overgrown cousin. Ty just grinned, as he looked up and stared at his giant, 7-foot tall cousin.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, you look awesome!” Ty grinned, as he looked up to his huge cousin, who was hulking over him like a giant muscle man. “You’re ready to go to the fair!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to the fair like this!” Peter protested, as he continued to stare at his muscular arms. He flexed, revealing his biceps, which rolled up like a bowling ball.<br />
<br />
“You and Ryan can be the muscle men at the fair!” Ty explained. “I need you to be big, so you can point the people to our booth!”<br />
<br />
Ty closed his eyes and concentrated. In an instant, both he and Peter were standing before the booth, which was located at the Orange County fairgrounds.<br />
<br />
Ryan and Allen were already there, and Allen was all set up to make badges for his customers, using his machine. Ryan and Peter then walked over to other ends of the fair, where they directed people to the booth.<br />
<br />
Large groups of kids flocked around the giant muscle men, who wore tank tops with several buttons pinned to their shirts. Whenever kids asked about those badges, Ryan and Peter just pointed them in the direction of the booth.<br />
<br />
When it was time to close the fair grounds on Sunday night, Allen, Ty, Peter and Ryan had made almost five hundred Dollars in profit! And Peter was a giant muscle man, just like Ryan!</p>
