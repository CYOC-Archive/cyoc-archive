<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We made our phone calls to invite our intended guests.  When I spoke to my brother Scott, he sounded a bit <br />
bemused by the coming changes.  He did not express disdain for it, but he was not enthusiastic either.  He <br />
summed it up by saying, &quot;Well, I wasn't getting any action like this, so maybe my changes will improve.&quot;  But <br />
in the end he agreed to come over.<br />
 <br />
My sister Pam, however, was the quite the opposite.  She sounded absolutely thrilled about what was going to <br />
happen.  She seemed quite thrilled at the prospect of never getting older.  She also possessed a rather sharp <br />
dislike for men, so much so that I assumed she was a lesbian.  She figured to be quite happy in a world void <br />
of males. <br />
 <br />
Rachel invited a friend of her who was named Joyce.  Rachel explained to me that she and Joyce used to model <br />
in some of the same places.  However, Joyce did not model anymore.  Rachel said it was either because she got <br />
tired of it or, more likely in Rachel's opinion, people just stopped using Joyce as a model.  Rachel told me <br />
that Joyce was in her mid-30's and that could be a difficult age for models.  Rachel speculated that Joyce <br />
would be someone who would regress in age due to our wishes.<br />
<br />
We told our expected guests that we planned to make a night of it, so we encouraged them all to bring food <br />
with them.  We found that this was a good idea.  As we watched the news, we found some other interesting <br />
results of our wishes.  It seemed that every business, restaurant and the like had decided to close and send <br />
home their employees until the changes finished.  The idea was to give everyone a chance to acclimate to the <br />
changes and then return to work anew.  It made sense to us, so we were glad things like this could happen <br />
without us wishing it so.<br />
<br />
It was now about 2:00 in the afternoon, about three hours since we made all of the wishes.  We started to look <br />
for signs of the changes taking hold.  While I continued to watch the news I began to rub my chin.  “I think <br />
I’ve found something,” I said to Rachel.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” she asked.  She noticed my actions and so walked over to me so she could also feel my face.  <br />
“Oh, it’s so smooth,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” I said.  “I haven’t shaved in two days.”<br />
<br />
“I’d say that’s a start,” she said.  She continued to run her fingers over my face.  Then she rubbed my arms.  <br />
I wore two short sleeve shirts, so my arms were bare.  “It’s happening here, too.  I don’t feel any hair at <br />
all.  Now I’m getting jealous,” she added.<br />
<br />
“Why?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Because,” she explained.  “I’m starting to think your skin is smoother than mine.  That’s not fair!”<br />
<br />
I ran my hands over her face and arms, and then back on my own.  “Nah, yours is still better,” I assured.<br />
<br />
“We’ll see how it ends,” she said.  “I think your hair is starting to change.”<br />
<br />
“Is it getting longer?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I can’t tell,” she said.  “But it looks like it’s getting…fuller.  Thicker,” she explained.  “It’s harder for <br />
me to run my hands through it.”<br />
<br />
Rachel suddenly backed away from me and sat on the other end of the couch.  “What’s wrong?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Something’s bothering me,” she said.  “Something doesn’t feel right.”<br />
<br />
“What doesn’t feel right?” I asked with concern.<br />
<br />
She bent over and untied the laces on her sneakers.  She pulled them off her feet as fast as she could.  She <br />
sat there for a few seconds and then said, “Oh, that’s better.”<br />
<br />
“Huh,” I said.  “I guess I didn’t think that wish would produce such a reaction.”<br />
<br />
“That was part of the no clothing wish, you think?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“What else could it have been?” I asked.  “Do you feel like putting them on again?”<br />
<br />
She looked at her discarded sneakers.  “No,” she said.  “But I know we made that wish, so I wouldn’t anyway.  <br />
We’ll have to test that question on someone else.”<br />
<br />
“Good point,” I said.  Just at that moment I felt extremely uncomfortable.  I felt what I could only describe <br />
as an itching sensation.  It took me a few seconds to figure out from where this feeling came.  I took of my <br />
own shoes, but that didn’t help.   I unbuttoned and removed my jeans as I determined that the feeling came <br />
from my lower body.  The feeling did not cease with my jeans off.  So I removed my boxers as quickly as I <br />
could.  Once they were gone the feeling dissipated.<br />
<br />
My feeling of relief was interrupted by the sound of Rachel laughing.  “Looks like someone’s happy to see me,” <br />
she said.<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked dumbfounded.  It hit me that I was naked from the waist down.  “Oh, yea,” I said.  I reached <br />
for my jeans with the intent of putting them on again.  I took another glance at my penis.  I asked, “Does it <br />
look smaller to you?”<br />
<br />
Rachel tilted her head.  “I can’t tell,” she said.  “I mean, the only time I saw it…it was pretty hard.  Ooh, <br />
I have an idea.”  She walked over to me and took a hold of my penis.  She ran her hand up and down over it and <br />
proceeded to give me a hand job.  It very quickly became erect again.  “Are you going to come?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh…not yet,” I said.<br />
<br />
She continued to work over my penis.  “How about now?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“N-no,” I said.  After a few more seconds I said, “I’m…almost…there.”<br />
<br />
“OK, good,” she said.  Just as suddenly as she began to jerk me off, she stopped.  “Now…is that as big as it <br />
usually gets?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I gave her a somewhat annoyed look.  But I obliged to answer her question.  I looked at my member and thought <br />
it looked smaller than normal.  “Yea, I think it’s a little smaller,” I admitted.<br />
<br />
“Well, there’s your answer then,” she said.  <br />
<br />
She started to walk into the kitchen.  “Hey!” I protested.  “You can’t leave me like this!”<br />
<br />
“Sure I can,” she teased.  “We have guests coming over, we don’t have time for that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, this just isn’t fair,” I whined slightly.  <br />
<br />
She walked back to me.  “Fine,” she said.  She bent down to her knees and enveloped my penis with her mouth.  <br />
Since my penis was still pretty erect, it only took a few seconds of her sucking at my penis before I climaxed <br />
with a loud groan.  She grabbed my legs so as though to steady myself.  She did not release my penis until I <br />
felt that I had shot my full lode.  “Mmm,” she said.  “I’m going to miss doing that.”  I gave her another odd <br />
look.  “What can I say?  I like giving blowjobs.”<br />
<br />
“You’re kidding,” I deadpanned.  “Considering you took all of that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, come on,” she said.  “You’re going to be offended?”<br />
<br />
“No,” I said.  “You say you want to be with me, I believe you.  I can’t begrudge you your past.”<br />
<br />
Just then there was a loud knock on the door.  “Get your pants on and get rid of those,” she said as she <br />
pointed at my boxers.  I put my jeans and sneakers on again, and did not get any feeling of discomfort.  I <br />
tossed my boxers into my bedroom.<br />
<br />
I ran back into the living room and opened the door to reveal…</p>
