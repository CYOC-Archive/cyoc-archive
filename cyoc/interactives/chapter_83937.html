<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck looked up and down at the male in front of her, whose face somehow managed to show frustration, embarrassment, and arousal all at once. &quot;You know, the only reason I went male again is I assumed you would, and I didn&#39;t want any weird sexual tension as a result of these overcharged rabbit hormones. Why didn&#39;t you tell me you were going to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck tilted her head up some to meet Wendy&#39;s indignant gaze, not something she&#39;d often had to do with anyone. &quot;I could ask you the same thing! We both know Terry&#39;s a girl, and you&#39;re a girl, so if I was too for this trip, tada, nobody&#39;s weird rewired brain is going to be giving them any thoughts that make everything weird for us when he comes home next month... and wait, again? You went through with the sex swap last time? I thought you were joking about that. Anyway, you can just go back through right? Or I could, this is a bit weirder than I thought it would be.&quot; She cupped her new breasts for emphasis, somewhat shocked at how different they felt than her usual flabby physique.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, there&#39;s some stupid rule against it. We&#39;re stuck like this all weekend. I guess I&#39;m going by Wally again and you might as well...&quot; he trailed off.<br />
<br />
It took a moment for Chuck to realize how Wally&#39;s gaze and dropped from her eyes to her chest. Blushing, she lowered her hands. &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t look like much of a &#39;Chuck&#39; now, do I.&quot; She thought for a moment. Chuckette? Chick? Some variation on Toss? It was short for Charles, which feminized more easily, but nobody had called her that since she was in grade school and it didn&#39;t sit right. She tried to think what else she&#39;d ever been called. Mostly just Camera Man. They hadn&#39;t let her take camera in though, but still... Cameraman... Cammy? Camron? Mera? Merin? &quot;I don&#39;t know... Carmen maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How exotic!&quot; Wally smirked, now taking her in a little more obvious than she was comfortable with.<br />
<br />
Carmen cleared her throat. &quot;Anyway, just... you have experience then, right? This all worked out for you last time. You didn&#39;t just get overwhelmed with... odd feelings, jump every bunny girl you saw or anything, right? That all takes a while to sink in. So... it&#39;s just for the weekend, and we just avoid awkwardly...&quot; This time she was the one getting distracted. Some motion had drawn her eyes downward and Wally was... at attention. For some reason, she was transfixed, completely losing her train of thought until he realized and turned around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Wally said, clearly trying for a lighter tone. &quot;Let&#39;s just head over to where Terry is staying. Avoid any... distractions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmen shook her head clear once his back was turned and started following along. She really hadn&#39;t anticipated anything like this right off the bat. The impression everyone had that was involved in this latest project of Terry&#39;s was that it took a while for any alien thought patterns to sink in. She decided it this must just be a temporary thing. A quick spike in hormone production while adapting to a new body. Something like that. She&#39;d be fine now though, Wally wasn&#39;t facing her anymore, and they were walking at a nice brisk pace. Nothing to really see from this angle. Just his feet... those long muscular legs... his butt... she&#39;d never really understood the appeal there for women, but this one was rather attractive somehow. Especially with that fluffy little tail right over it. Almost taunting her to give it just a quick playful little tug...<br />
<br />
Distracted, she didn&#39;t realize Wally had stopped for a moment, glancing around to be sure this was still the right way. She blundered right into him, knocking them both off balance, and somehow as they tumbled to the ground, he managed to spin around to face her, and she fell forward, landing right on top of him, like a scene from some bawdy lowbrow comedy. She worried for a moment that he might be hurt. The ground was certainly soft enough, but her leg brushed up against something like a broken tree branch, which would have to have been right- oh. Well still... she had to be sure he was OK. Looking into his eyes he certainly seemed fine. Maybe a bit too amused. It was just a question of shifting her weight a little. Lifting herself up off of him to just get repositioned and... now just to... stand up. Right? She felt his hands sliding up her hips, helping brace her as she... as she...<br />

Tran wasn&#39;t sure how he&#39;d gotten this far without being captured, but he wasn&#39;t sure about a lot of things. Panic reflex must be instincts get too strong when there&#39;s danger Mark lied Mark lied can&#39;t think and fly too easily scared then panic then go blank then not in the forest got out of the forest no more helicopter no more shouting no more Mark no briefcase need to go back can&#39;t go back they took them they took them can&#39;t go back keep going south south for now south south south he knew it all he&#39;d teach someone make more pretty harpies lots more just needed him had the template was the template just copy not hard real girls for pretty birds not hard just get south moving without flying oh right the truck truck truck, landed on the truck, nice shiny pretty truck going south right way too big never saw him too low not flying just riding wouldn&#39;t get caught wouldn&#39;t expect truck was good good truck still going south? Still going south. Close now big border gotta get across lots of guards just get past cross the border then they can&#39;t catch him safe safe safe relax there then further south pretty water nice warm other harpies nice safe.<br />

<br />
While most of those responsible for recent unpleasant events had evaded incarceration, none could really be said to have made a clean break of it. The stags, with the exception of Vinny, were eventually allowed to depart from the park, and even take their new trophy does. The civil suits against them would likely ruin them in the long term, while in the short, word travelled fast. Jobs were lost, friends severed ties, strangers would hurl insults and sometimes even rocks when they walked by. The carefree lives they&#39;d always attributed to their &quot;alpha male superiority&quot; was quite rapidly eroding as they went from being seen as the upper crust of society to just a pack of amoral brats who thought they could get away with anything. Of course, life rarely delivers justice so cleanly, and not a small number of innocent deermorphs who had chosen to live outside the park were beginning to face the same sort of treatment.<br />
<br />
Those who had fled the park in disguise faced a more ironic fate. Gunther had helped a fair number secure transformation chamber time, and made sure their changes weren&#39;t recorded, but he&#39;d given them a similar treatment to what they had inflicted on the does. While they weren&#39;t made into the same sort of willing sex slaves, the instincts of their new forms were heightened. Greatly heightened. Those who actually did leave the park were drawn to the surrounding wilderness. High powered lawyers who had planned to skip the country and live off the bribes they&#39;d received were suddenly more concerned with digging burrows in the dirt, or chasing after squirrels. Some hadn&#39;t even left the park. A husky on patrol stumbled across a pair of frolicking fennec foxes not long after Wendy and Chuck&#39;s arrival who stood out not only from their lack of documentation, but their inhuman behavior. Neither seemed particularly keen on speaking, or even walking upright, instead just chasing each other around on all fours, yipping excitedly.<br />
<br />
Those from the offsite facility were in a similar boat. While most had been confident in the state of their experiments, they&#39;d all taken a gamble, and most had lost. The half-snake couple were more fortunate than most, turning out somewhat emotionally stunted, but still in full control of their mental faculties. Those with less recognizably human bodies faired worse. Intellects and motor skills were impaired, and remained so even when changing some to more traditional anthroforms. The pair of lizards were a particularly lost cause. Being so thoroughly unresponsive, and striking the park staff as a danger to the guests, they were removed from the grounds entirely, and transfered to a local zoo to be tended to until a better plan came forth.<br />
<br />
Then of course there was Mark. Identified on a blind guess, and still in a severely compromised mental state. After realizing how long she would need to stay in her current form, a special habitat was secured in the form of a repurposed greenhouse. It could easily maintain the levels of temperature and humidity her body had been designed for, and gave enough of a view of the open sky that her claustrophobic panic was manageable without sedation. The hope had been that these conditions would help calm her down enough for a proper interrogation, but her behavior had only become more birdlike. When questioned, she would answer in short cryptic phrases, sometimes simply repeating what she was asked in mimicking fashion. Her primary concern seemed to be fashioning a nest, as she prepared to lay what was speculated to be as many as half a dozen eggs, most likely within the next month.<br />
<br />

<br />
After their spontaneous and quite vigorous session of lovemaking had concluded, Wally and Carmen stood and dusted themselves off. Carmen had quite thoroughly enjoyed herself at the time but was now in a bit of a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;We absolutely, positively, cannot let Terry know that happened!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wally chuckled. The one thing he was definitely sure of was that Terry would make absolutely no judgement about this sort of thing. He tried to explain this, finally explaining just how Terry had greeted him on his last visit, but she remained in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a guy thing. I mean... you know what I mean. I just... once we&#39;re all back to normal, it&#39;ll just make things too weird between us if he knows we... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be able to judge... and honestly, tackling me like that before we even got to the warren, it&#39;s most likely going to come up for you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carmen stole another quick glance at his crotch when he said this, blushing before continuing. &quot;Well... can&#39;t we just... not tell him its me? Just... say I got cold feet, and you happened to meet another bunny girl on the way in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wally chuckled. It was hard to say no to such a cute face after all.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Terry was with Tim when when Wally and Carmen arrived. That was getting to be the case more often than not. This week there happened to be more males than females in the warren, making it that much more obvious that she was playing favorites. Tim had become something of a one doe buck, and it was fairly common for the other rabbits to speculate on whether he only had eyes for her, or whether it was just that she only let him loose when he was too sore to perform. Terry could honestly attest that the latter was true, and hoped for the former as well. Of course, she still somehow found the time to spend with some of the other bucks, particularly with new arrivals.<br />
<br />
She was rather happy to see Wally again, remembering the last night they&#39;d spend together like this in far more vivid detail than any night with Wendy. After she finished greeting him in her usual fashion, Wally took her back towards the entrance to the warrens, to meet her &#39;new friend&#39; Carmen. Terry by now could quite easily recognize she was a new girl, in both senses of the term, and suggested a few bucks who would be happy to get to know her. Her response was enough of a stunned silence she wondered for a moment if the new girl might only speak Spanish. Wally meanwhile asked where Katerina was, and was quite visibly disappointed when she explained that she&#39;d left, and Tim was currently in charge. Terry was about to introduce her to Roberta and run back off to find Tim again, but Wally insisted on a bit more small talk first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry it&#39;s just me again, I almost talked Chuck into tagging along,&quot; he said, catching Terry off guard for a moment. She thought back to all the bucks who had come and gone, unable to place him. Seeing her confusion, Wally shouted, &quot;Chuck! From outside, he almost got his camera in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Terry shouted in sudden recognition and embarrassment. Of course he&#39;d meant that Chuck. She managed to say &quot;that&#39;s a shame,&quot; as she lost herself for a moment trying to recall the details of her former life. She was having a surprisingly difficult time recalling just what Chuck looked like. He was a buck, she knew, always carrying that camera around. Rather large in general, quite a bit overweight. Was he lop-eared? She couldn&#39;t picture them standing over his head. And of course in the lovemaking department... she blinked. She couldn&#39;t recall ever having had her way with Chuck! Had he been so unimpressive she&#39;d forgotten all about it, or was there actually still a buck in her life she hadn&#39;t taken for a spin? Well, that was something to look forward to next time Wally came for a visit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, have you been following the whole scandal?&quot; Terry had no idea what Wally had meant. He started to explain, but Terry became so noticeably tense with fear at the mention of any sort of predatory animal, he eventually just apologized, saying he&#39;d explain it all later. &quot;So... is it too rude of me to ask how you handled your first monthly visitor?&quot; he continued. Terry wasn&#39;t sure she followed, until Wally had run through some more colorful euphamisms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! No, I haven&#39;t had to deal with anything like that, no.&quot; Terry wasn&#39;t entirely sure it was an issue that would ever come up. Either these bodies had been designed not to have to deal with it, the population rotated out too fast for it to come up, or everyone just had some discreet system for dealing with this sort of thing she hadn&#39;t picked up on. Or maybe it was the berries. Certain contraceptives were supposed to prevent that whole process weren&#39;t they? Of course, she hadn&#39;t been eating any for the last few days. She&#39;d quietly been considering if she should stop altogether for some time now, and lately it seemed they might be making her a bit sick. These last few mornings she&#39;d been more than a bit nauseous, and whatever was in those berries couldn&#39;t be helpful under those conditions. Of course, she didn&#39;t want to share this with Wally... he&#39;d likely try and force her to leave early if he knew.</p>
