<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff spent the next two minutes scrolling up and down the screen before he sat back. All the options sounded interesting, but he wasn&#39;t able to decide which one caught his interest. Scrolling through lists that included domestic house pets that ranged from cats, dogs, to even goldfish, ferrets and rats, to barnyard beasts of cows, horses, hens, roosters, sheep, pigs and the other types, to even wild animals like deer, mountain lions, birds and even those found under freshwater and saltwater, he narrowed it down to deciding to start with domestic animals.<br />
<br />
Gone through the list once more, Jeff found he still couldn&#39;t decide. The prospect of lazing around and being a house cat sounded as good as being the family dog. He even considered switching his sex and gender. After a bit of thinking, the one thing he did rule out was that he didn&#39;t want to be a fish of any kind. Sitting back, wondering, &quot;Ferret? Dog? Cat? Snake? Lizard? Rat? Gerbil maybe?&quot; he decided he needed to take a walk, clear his head, and standing, he stretched, paced back and forth for a moment before he turned away from his computer. Marching across the room and unlocking the door, he pulled it open, made sure it was locked again as he pulled it shut and failing to realise the latch hadn&#39;t caught, he called out to his sister, &quot;I&#39;m going for a walk. Try not to get into any trouble,&quot; before he headed out.<br />
<br />
From where she sat on her bed, Lisa heard this, and made a rude face. At eleven years old, she didn&#39;t understand why mom and dad still insisted she needed a babysitter, much less her older brother watching her. Believing she was old enough to mind herself, Lisa tried to go back to the book she&#39;d been reading, but found herself distracted as she thought about the programme Jeff had been running on his PC. Trying to tell herself, &quot;Not my business what the idiot does, or the trash he downloads,&quot; she read a page, turned it, read another, and understanding she hadn&#39;t taken in a single word, she went back and tried again, but found herself still distracted.<br />
<br />
Curious about the programme, she tossed aside the book and stood. Straightening the comforter on her bed so it looked like she hadn&#39;t been sitting on it, she exited her room and looked down the hallway. Seeing her brother&#39;s door shut, she figured he&#39;d probably locked it, and giving up, ready to give her book another go, she instead headed down the hall. Reaching Jeff&#39;s bedroom, she pushed on the door, and when she&#39;d found she&#39;d been correct when she thought the door hadn&#39;t been closed all the way, she stepped into her brother&#39;s room. Wrinkling her nose at not only the sight of clothes and whatnot scattered all over the room and the unmade bed, but also the subtle tang of an unwashed teenage male who did stuff one only did in the privacy of their room, she considered opening the window, but changed her mind when she saw the computer still on and the programme still running. Walking over to the desk, she peered at the screen, and after a moment, picked up the disk. Reading &quot;Chronivac&quot; printed on it, along with a version number and bit of other information, such as who manufactured it, she slipped it into the front pouch-like pocket of her sweatshirt.<br />
<br />
Her attention drawn to the computer, Lisa refused to sit down in the desk chair. Worried about what her older brother might have done into front of the PC, she was content to stand as she studied the screen. Grasping quickly what it was the programme could do, she uttered a short laugh, both at the idea that it could do what it claimed and at the notion that her brother actually considered becoming an animal. Reaching out to the keyboard, she tapped out a series of commands. Thinking of all the times she asked, bugged, and pleaded with her parents to get her a dog, Lisa thought that if the programme actually did what it claimed, she could get herself a canine companion and deal with the annoyance she saw as her older brother in swell foop. Figuring she&#39;d rather have a bitch, she changed Jeff&#39;s sex and gender to that of female. Clicking on the option for canines, she scrolled through the list and after a moment selected her brother&#39;s new species as beagle.<br />
<br />
Lost in the moment, she set the transformation as a slow one. After she&#39;d done that, she clicked on the option that only she and Jeff would be aware of the transformation, that it would be unpleasant, but rather a turn on, and the first thing to change would be reality so that everyone  but her and her brother saw him as a dog as well as that his speech would become the normal barks, howls, cries and other sounds of a pooch. Setting his age at five months, she set his maximum age at twenty, turned off the option of him ever being spayed, and set it so that he was fully housebroken. Unsure what the programme meant by making the changes permanent, she almost by passed it over, but, at the last minute, activated it. Setting it so that he was up to date on all his shots and heart worm, she flipped through the screens and drop-down boxes, studying and tapping out information every so often. Wanting to make it as perfect as she could, she even went so far as to change Jeff&#39;s name to Nikki, he&#39;d keep wearing clothes until he had a proper fur coat, that he’d never have fleas and ticks, and would be sexually attracted to male dogs.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with everything she&#39;d done, yet still leery about what it claimed, Lisa scanned through all what she&#39;d done, made a few alterations to what she was starting to view as not Jeff her brother but Nikki the beagle, she even went so far as to instruct the programme that Nikki would only suffer from minor arthritis as she got older before she hit save and the button to execute the changes requested. Leaving the computer the way she’d found it, the eleven year old girl exited the room. Pulling the door shut, and making sure the latch caught, she didn’t see it as her brother&#39;s bedroom started to morph as things disappeared, rearranged and came into being.</p>
