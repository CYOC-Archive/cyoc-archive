<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trip back was... tense... Zelki was buried, her belongings packed up and Rick was made to bring them back. Every so often Rick would continue to [Cure Wounds] Rina, and she seemed to be getting happier and happier. The Lithe man though hadn&#39;t shared his name yet though. He was still probably processing what was happening and what his next move would be after getting back to a city, and not just some collection of sheds and shacks where some stone age primitives may have attempted to make... the ones on the way were more bronze age. The city however was made out of nice stone, smooth cobblestone roads, and hints of magic. Magic didn&#39;t gush around every corner, but there were hints here and there. A door that may appear, and the animal-like door hinge looking around to see if the right person was around. A small booth with jewelry that glowed softly... A [Wizard] performing magic on the side of the street opposite to a [Magician] who was trying to make everything done with slight of hand and tricks instead of magic. The group of 3 walked into an adventurer&#39;s guild and sat at a table. Equipment in bags of holding, and Rina in her armor so people would recognize her by it.<br />
<br />
The Lithe man said &quot;Ok... before we make any declarations to the guild, I am still going to be adventuring whether or not whatever is left of the team is intact. Now Rick, do you know what you want to do or at least have some idea of what you want to do?&quot;<br />
Rick shook his head &quot;Not really. I know I don&#39;t want to adventure though. Just trying to hunt or butcher game made me realize I&#39;m probably not made for that type of life...&quot;<br />
&quot;Aye, your a little soft. That&#39;s fine and can be respected.&quot; the Lithe man then gave a look to Rina &quot;As for you, Rick can probably make a good living here himself and he doesn&#39;t need a high level warrior protecting him. Are you going to follow him to the ends of the world or are you still an adventurer?&quot;<br />
Rina wished her [quick sidestep] worked rhetorically but &quot;...After our adventure we&#39;d need a few days to rest and relax a little. I&#39;d also like to see if Rick can secure himself a place in society first.&quot; <br />
The Lithe man gave her a look &quot;Rina, can you m-&quot; the armor didn&#39;t give him much to work off of body language nor did the visor give him much to look at for facial features... Still he didn&#39;t want to push Rina since she may just quit the team entirely, and that may put him back significantly in terms of party power... They still needed a magic user that was competent.  The Lithe man sighed and then went to the receptionist and confirmed the death of Zelki, and ordered a delivery of their gear and gold brought to their family. That was a standard that needed to be upheld. The Lithe man then came back and said &quot;Alright... that&#39;s what we needed to do. Go off and do whatever you need to do in town... I&#39;ll be doing my own thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
That left Rina and Rick to walk the streets, and now Rina had taken off her armor. She still had various scars, some deformities, and was obviously very muscular... But was also obviously female at a glance, and as she described it barely anyone would recognize her. Most people would think she was some middling adventurer who took a few too many blows, but was still in the early days of their career. Rick mostly didn&#39;t stand out as he was wearing one of Zelki&#39;s old robes over his clothes. Rina brought Rick to what looked like a giant crater in the center of the city hundreds of feet wide. There were people around a number of which were in mourning Rina sighed and said &quot;So this was a gods doing... Not the god themselves, but a minion of theirs was sent and they did so much damage and had to be ended with a massive spell that took several high level spell casters to cast. I don&#39;t have Zelki&#39;s stance, but just be careful... Gods can do a lot and several can be petty, spiteful, and vindictive. They only started popping up again a year ago after... I still don&#39;t even understand all the details. Let&#39;s just say ancient wars and conspiracies topped ontop of one another.&quot; <br />
Eroia whispered into Ricks being &quot;I was just given a nice place to take a nap... A did, and apparently now my brethren have died or been trapped... the Elves did so much apparently, and yet I still can&#39;t be that mad since they have a style to them...&quot;<br />
Rick said &quot;I guess there are a lot of people here not keen on gods or [priests] now then?&quot;<br />
Rina said &quot;It&#39;s more complicated than that... Most people hate THAT particular god, and there&#39;s hesitancy about gods in general. However there are a few that are earning some trust... and a [priest] or two that popped up have gathered fame for their blessings... your [Cure Wounds] can easily make you a lot of money, and you could start up a church or something... All depending on if your goddess doesn&#39;t do anything to piss everyone off.&quot;<br />
Rick then asked &quot;So... know what you need to do to make a small stall or roadside service?&quot;</p>
