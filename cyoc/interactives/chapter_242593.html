<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neither liked the idea of having to wait for forty-eight hours. Alan had wanted to see Jeff&#39;s sister and her friends from the perspective of a plush, whilst Jeff was curious to know what his sister and her friends talked about. But now, seeing their plans had blown up in their plush faces, each decided the best thing for them to do was to try and get back to Jeff&#39;s place and undo the change.<br />
<br />
As they agree on this, Alan secretly amended he&#39;d use the Chronivac to become a toy again, but this time he&#39;d make sure he ended up in the bedroom of the actual Riley.<br />
<br />
With each believing the matter settled, the next thing they saw they had to do was figure out where they were and from there, get back to Jeff’s. Their plush forms moving silently across the room, Jeff and Alan stopped in front of the door. Peering up at the doorknob, each trying to work out how to get up to it and open it, the plush otter looks over at the plush raccoon and was about to ask something when he realised what they still had on. Running a plush paw over the white nightgown he had on, Jeff though { hold up a minute } { before we do anything, I think we out to get out of these clothes } and Alan agreeing with this, the two spent a couple minutes trying to undress.<br />
<br />
It becoming clear after some time no matter what they tried, their current forms were not suited to the task, Alan soon swore { dammit } whilst Jeff sighed in frustration.<br />
<br />
Upset with the idea of having to go about dressed the way they were, with Alan more so than Jeff, as he was still wearing a nappy and dressed like a baby, a hushed mental conversation went back and forth as Jeff asked { an idea of what to do? } Alan replied { I don&#39;t know } and then they started bouncing ideas off one another, tried to assist the other in undressing, and when it was clear they had no choice but to go about as they were, they each thought how they’d huff in disapproval, vent their anger as they turned their attention back to the door.<br />
<br />
Frustrated by their predicament, how there was stuff they should have thought out better, &quot;Like having something we can actually use to grip with precision,&quot; Jeff groused to himself at one point, they began trying to reach the doorknob. Climbing clumsily back onto the bed, careful not to wake Riley, they tried leaping to the door a couple times, but discovered the distance was too great. Searching for something to push against the door and climb up on, the best they could find was the plastic chairs to Riley&#39;s tea-table, but, even stacked, they didn&#39;t give them the height they needed. Trying to boost each up, with one standing on the other, all they managed was to fall over or to squish the one below the other.<br />
<br />
This not hurting them in any way, it did leave them even more aggravated by their situation. Stopping after some time, Jeff sat down and thought { I&#39;m calling it } { we shan&#39;t be able to get out that way }<br />
<br />
Not ready to give up, Alan glanced at the door, then at his friend, and demanded { so what else can we do }<br />
<br />
The otter plush stared at him, as if blaming him for their problems, but didn&#39;t say anything. Unable to see the look his friend was giving him, the raccoon plush waddled over and sat down next to the shadowy form of Jeff&#39;s plush body. Both thinking, staring at the door, believing it was their way out, Jeff stood up after some time. Starting to wander, letting his mind drift as he tried to work out a solution, he also mentally went over the problems they&#39;d discovered with being a couple plush toys. Thinking of their size in comparison to everything around them, their lack of ability to grab specific things, how they were limited to only communicating with each other via telepathy, the list continued on, growing and growing until, feeling depressed and hopeless, Jeff stopped and peered about.<br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s room lit by a soft glow, he could make out only shadows of things. Seeing the one he knew was Alan, he started to wonder what else they could do when it came as a start as he realised there was more than one light source. Thinking { hey, Alan } and when he had the other&#39;s attention, he asked { is it just me, or is there more than one source of light }<br />
<br />
Having been lost in thought, it took Alan a moment before he understood what Jeff was inquiring. About to tell him the only the light was from the nightlight, he stopped when it came to him there was more than one. Looking about, it suddenly coming to him there was a window, which he wondered how it was he could&#39;ve missed such a thing, he was about to point it out to Jeff, but could see the other had already worked it out as well. The two moving across the room to the window, of which moonlight was shining in a set of partway closed curtains, it was Alan who stated { we can totally climb up there } as he indicated how they could get up on Riley&#39;s toy box, and from there, the bookcase under the window. Agreeing, Jeff walked over to the toybox, and after examining it, he went around to the side of it, and placed his back against a piece of furniture next to it, which was so large compared to his size, he couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. Pressing his plush paws against the box, he slowly began to force his way upward.<br />
<br />
From where he stood, Alan could just barely make out the shape of his friend as he moved upward. Looking about, thinking, it didn&#39;t take him long before he spotted an easier way up. Taking it, he waited until Jeff was almost up before reaching down and with some difficulty, and the other&#39;s assistance, dragged him up the rest of the way. Neither speaking for the moment, though Jeff did want to know how Alan had gotten up before him, the two set about the next part of their climb.<br />
<br />
It taking them a little longer than they&#39;d expected, Jeff and Alan were relieved when they at last managed to get up on the bookcase. Seeing the window was already open a smidge, Jeff imagined how the cool, summer night air would smell if he still had a nose as Alan shoved his plush front paws under the lip. Jeff following suit, they mentally grunted and groaned as they worked to force the window upward. The thing a lot heavier, bulkier, it took everything they had to get it up, and when they at last had it up far enough, Jeff leaned against the screen, thinking how the only thing keeping them from leaving now was the wire mesh as Alan tried to figure out how they were going to get past the screen.</p>
