<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benjamin was pleased to read that the program was now available as app, so as to make it portable.  He quickly and effortlessly configured his smart phone, and then paused to think where he should go.<br />
<br />
He was afraid to try it out on himself until he knew better how it worked.  He needed someplace with a lot of people to test it on, but where he could be anonymous about it.  The mall?  No, he wanted a more homogeneous group to test it on.  Oh, yeah, there was a football scrimmage schedule at college, and since it was free there would be lots of anonymous spectators.  The 40 plus guys on the field would all be between age 20 and 23, and in generally excellent health.  He grinned.  So many possibilities.  Subtle changes first he told himself, but what and who and-<br />
<br />
Benjamin was lost in thought with the possibilities.  He didn&#39;t even realize he had walked all the way to the stadium until he was finding a seat on a bench near the team entrance.  The practice was just wrapping up.  <br />
<br />
Kyle Jenkins or &quot;Cagey&quot; was the starting quarterback.  He had gone into the locker room to relieve himself before the practice game, and sauntered out of the entrance right under Benjamin&#39;s intense gaze.  He felt the eyes boring into his back.  He turned to look over his shoulder expecting to see a cheerleader or - but no it was Benjamin, and his eyes were focused on Cagey&#39;s tight ass in his tight football pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, whatcha looking at, perv?&quot;<br />
<br />
Benjamin blinked.  Cagey puffed out his chest, and marched over to the railing between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked you, perv boy, whatcha looking at?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  Oh, I was thinking that my butt wouldn&#39;t look that good in those tight football pants you wear.  Aren&#39;t you embarrassed by how tight and transparent those things are?&quot; Benjamin blurted out.<br />
<br />
His phone pinged softly.  He had forgotten that Chronovac App was open.<br />
<br />
Cagey was thrown for a moment.  &quot;Huh?  Embarrassed. Sure? No?  Uh, the uniform is part of the game rules, it has to be tight so the other players cannot grab on to it.  And the rules or tradition says home games, the home team wears white.  I have a pair of royal blue ones for away games,&quot; he said defensively.<br />
<br />
Benjamin didn&#39;t seem to be paying attention to him, his eyes were fixed on his phone screen.  It was filling up with all sorts of stats on subject two Kyle Jenkins.  It even included his nickname &quot;Cagey&quot;.  There were so many measurements, Benjamin was sure he could build a nude statue to the specifications that would look like it had been a bodycast of Kyle.<br />
<br />
Hm, &quot;football rules&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot;.  He smiled as he clicked on the link to American Football under Kyle&#39;s Chronovac Profile.  He then selected the uniform.  He typed a few things, and looked up at Kyle&#39;s retreating ass.  He hit enter.<br />
<br />
Instantly, Kyle&#39;s uniform changed.  The pants were still white spandex hugging his butt cheeks, but now they were like chaps with an open seat, and crotch.  Kyle&#39;s reality shifted.  He&#39;d been wearing this uniform all summer for practice and now sported a unique pair of tanned buns in the shape of the pants opening.  So did all the other players.  Benjamin surveyed the open crotches displaying different bulging jockstraps, and the other tanned butt cheeks.  He giggled.  He glanced down and saw that the screen seemed blurry.  He couldn&#39;t read the words of a minute.  Oh, yeah, the tutorial said that changing one thing often adjusted other things.  The uniform was designed to conform with the game rules.  So when he changed the uniform, he changed the rules too.  He scrolled back.  The heading no longer read College American Football Rules, Traditions & Uniforms.<br />
<br />
It now read College Fag Football Rules, Traditions and Uniforms.  He eagerly read through the rules.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, uh, Benjamin, you&#39;re queer right?&quot; asked a voice. <br />
<br />
Benjamin looked up, it was Kyle again, but he didn&#39;t answer.  Kyle seemed different, almost apologetic.  What did he want?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, did you see that last play?&quot;<br />
<br />
Had the game started?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was reading about the rules, so I could follow the game better,&quot; Benjamin answered truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I got my ass reamed,&quot; he said rubbing his backside.  &quot;Uh, coach says, I need tutoring.  A sort of workout buddy to toughen up my anus.  He gave me these dildos to use, but they&#39;re huge!&quot;  He held a plastic baggy containing a three large dildos. &quot;Coach said I might have to work my way up to these, and well, I saw you in the locker room, and uh, would you tutor me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to fuck your ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kyle was flustered, &quot;I guess?  Uh, sorry, this was a bad idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benjamin answered too quickly, &quot;No, Kyle, it&#39;s a good idea.  Come by my house tonight at 8PM for your first tutorial lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but remember I&#39;m straight, I just need to do this for the game.  It&#39;s not a study date.&quot;  He turned and walked toward the locker room.  Cum dribbled from his ass crack staining his new football pants.  <br />
<br />
Benjamin scrolled down to quarterbacks.  One entry jumped out at him, &quot;The best quarterbacks are power bottoms.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Coach Mallory Gideon came over to the railing, as some of the players headed into the locker room, and others ran laps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Benji, are you going to tutor Cagey?  He&#39;s really intimidated by cock, and I cannot have a quarterback who is able to be tackled a few dozen times in a game.  I thought maybe you and your buds could uh stretch his hole some before next week&#39;s practice game.  Kyle&#39;s got a great arm, but if we cannot whip his ass into shape, I&#39;ll need another quarterback.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m meeting with him tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benjamin glances at his own stats.  Damn, he must&#39;ve boosted his confidence before he came to the stadium.  He wasn&#39;t aware that he had but the Chronovac showed changes in red, and original stats in black.   He glanced at his penis, he hadn&#39;t changed the flaccid size, but when erect he was now 12 inches long instead of five inches.  Oh, he couldn&#39;t wait to try it out.  Less than 3 hours before, he&#39;d get the opportunity.  Benjamin noticed a few other ripples from his uniform change.  The Sports Illustrated cover on the news stand could pass for a gay magazine.  Apparently, full contact male-male rape tackles were acceptable in other sports too, so their uniforms were different too.  He glanced up at the billboard of the NFL Star hawking beer, and saw it was now a wine cooler.  He smiled.  Interesting, interesting.  He definitely needed to increase his stamina for his workout with Kyle tonight.  He began typing.<br />
<br />
He left the setting of his male sexual desire at average, but adjusted the sliding scale below it up to the maximum.  The Chronovac hummed and blurred for a second.  He had slid the marker from 5 to 10 on the scale, but now the scale went up to twenty.  He looked at the average which was flashing.  He had just boosted every guy&#39;s sex drive by 100%.  Which meant the guys who were sevens and eights, were now at least twelves and thirteens, or if it was proportional then fourteens and sixteens.  He clicked on his &quot;average setting&quot; and changed it to top 1%.  His trousers swelled as his cock engorged.  His scale shifted from 10 to 19.9 out of 20.  Damn, he couldn&#39;t wait until 8PM.  Should he buy condoms?<br />
<br />
Benjamin decides to google the practice game to watch Kyle get tackled...</p>
