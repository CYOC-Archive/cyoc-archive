<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel stood in the yard and considered the current state of events. After her transformation, Daniel&#39;s mother had settled into peacefully chomping on some of the flowers in her garden. She surely couldn&#39;t be left in the yard though. One of the neighbours would be sure to see and report the stag. Frantically thinking about his options, Daniel came to a solution. The boy hurried inside to grab some supplies. He emerged into the yard a moment later with a box of vegetables from the kitchen. Perhaps he could lure his mother into the shed in the corner of the yard. Once contained he would have some time to figure out a solution to his current problems.<br />
<br />
Not sure as to how much of his mother was left in the hulking beast in the yard, Daniel attached some produce to a stick and moved towards his mother. Using the produce as bait, Daniel was able to successfully gain his mother&#39;s attention and lead the former woman towards the shed. She continued to follow until finally she was in the shed. Daniel quickly scooted around his mom&#39;s hulking body, kicked the remaining vegetables inside and closed the door. Well, that was one task out of the way. Now to figure out a way to fix his mother.<br />
<br />
 Going straight to his computer, Daniel got right to work on researching other incidents similar to what he had observed. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t come up with much. While he was able to come up with stories of bizarre disappearances, Daniel had no luck finding any accounts similar to what had befallen his mom. Fortunately, though, Daniel&#39;s mother seemed to be at least content in the shed and made minimal commotion.<br />
<br />
Minutes quickly stretched into hours and Daniel had made zero progress. It was now getting towards evening. A short knock on the door broke Daniel from his research.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bro, you seen mom? Wondering what we&#39;re doing for dinner&quot; his sister Susan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh um no, I think she might have gone out&quot; Daniel hastily replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think so, her shoes are at the door and car&#39;s in the garage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... um well uh let me see if I can find her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever&quot; Susan finished as she left her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap crap crap&quot; Daniel fretted. What was he going to do. His mom was in the shed in the body of a stag. How was he going to explain this to his family. Retreating from his room, Daniel made his way downstairs. May as well survey the damage at least. Heading outside, Daniel heard some rumbling from the shed. Odd, his mother seemed to have been fairly quiet for the bulk of the afternoon. Worriedly Daniel moved towards the door of the shed. Maybe she had gathered her energy back and was ready for another display like earlier. Grimacing Daniel pulled open the door.<br />
<br />
He saw nothing. Yard tools and half eaten produce were strewn around the room but in the gloom Daniel couldn&#39;t make out his mom. Kneeling down near the entrance Daniel could see white droplets on the floor and began fretting again. Maybe his mom was having another episode, driven mad by her new male hormones. A loud groan broke the silence.<br />
<br />
Listening closely Daniel could hear subdued grunts and groans emerging from the back of the shed. He slowly moved closer, hearing cracks and pops as he did so. The groans began to become more feminine in tone, losing some of the deep booming that they had earlier. As he got closer to the edge of the shed, Daniel could make out a hulking figure. It was frantically stroking at the erect, animalistic cock jutting from its groin. Distracted by its pleasure, the creature didn&#39;t notice Daniel as he moved closer and was able to get a good look at it.<br />
<br />
This was clearly the stag his mom had transformed into, but it was changing. The beast now comfortably stood on two legs while its thick brown fur slowly receded into its skin. Without the fur, Daniel was able to observe other changes. The hands stroking the still very animal-like cock were certainly those of a human. Cracks echoed from legs and feet as joints rearranged and the beast&#39;s posture changed to that of a normal human. Solid hooves parted and feet formed, individual toes spreading out. <br />
<br />
Further changes developed from there. Hard muscle enveloping the creature&#39;s body slowly softened, eventually leaving the skin and muscle of a middle aged woman. Groans and grunts escaped the beast as pressure was evidently building in its chest. Bumps began to swell as breasts began to grow in over formerly hard pecs. At this, the beast spread up its stroking, prompting an eventual cry of ecstasy as it climaxed. A cry that was very much the voice of Daniel&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
As his mom returned to pleasuring herself, Daniel watched with anticipation as he could see her stag visage compress, pulling inward. The creatures long muzzle reformed into the face of his mother. Last but not least, the antlers atop the woman&#39;s head shuddered as they pulled inward, retreating into her scalp. Luscious hair fell, forming into her normal cut prior to the initial transformation. For all intents and purposes, the creature jerking itself off in the shed was now very much Daniel&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeesssss!&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel jumped back, surprised by his mother&#39;s cry of pleasure. Long strings of white sprung from her shrinking appendage as she shuddered in orgasm. &quot;Mom?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
The woman turned in surprise at hearing Daniel. &quot;Daniel! It&#39;s you! I&#39;m so sorry for earlier. What happened to me?&quot; Daniel&#39;s mother exclaimed.<br />
<br />
The woman, now having somewhat come to her senses, looked in shock at her body, particularly the dwindling stag penis and testicles very slowly pulling into her. <br />
<br />
Daniel hugged his mom, being careful to avoid her evidently still sensitive member. &quot;I can explain mom. It all started when I... Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s face scrunched up in an odd expression. &quot;Oooh something&#39;s happening. Oh Daniel!&quot; she cried as her cock gave one last surge and jettisoned cum over her son. &quot;Oh my god! I&#39;m so sorry. Eeep!&quot; Daniel&#39;s mother jumped as another squirt of liquid flew from her appendage. The squirts continued for some time until eventually, with one last squirt, the cock retreated into her body followed by her testicles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I think I&#39;m good now.&quot; Daniel&#39;s mom reassured him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great, I think we need to get you some clothes though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel&#39;s mom blushed a deep red as she looked down at her naked body. The two quickly turned to leave the shed.</p>
