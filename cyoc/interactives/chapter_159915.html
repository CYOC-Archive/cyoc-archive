<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a tall office building in the center of downtown a man stood, scowling as he looked out the window.  Ryan Neeson knew that someone had used magic, powerful magic, to change the world so that women dominated men. It was despicable, a total perversion of the natural order.  The strange thing was that he had been unaffected.  He was now perhaps the tallest, strongest, and furthermore most aggressive and dominant man in a world of tiny wimps.  Furthermore, he still had his company, which made him the richest self-made man in a world where few men made it very far. <br />
<br />
 He looked at his ring of Rajinn.  It protected him from the powers of other rings of Rajinn, but surely it couldn&#39;t have been another such ring that had done all of this?  You&#39;d have to charge one for centuries to do it, and he knew of the other ring users, knew their rings didn&#39;t have such charges in them...at least not positive charges. One could theoretically break a ring and use its negative energy, but that was risky to the user.  Was that what had happened?  But still, who who had done it?  It wouldn&#39;t be James or Kathrine or Alex, they were too sensible for this, but Angela...that crazy witch had TWO rings, and had loaned one of them out before.  So there could be a new player...<br />
<br />
All in all, he had in some ways profited from the change.  As the richest self-made man, he now had considerable fame.  But these new women were just unacceptable.  He couldn&#39;t live in a world where women didn&#39;t know their place.  He had to change it back.  Should he break his own ring and right this wrong?  Create a world even better than the original, one fully dominated by men?  Well, it would probably be prudent to first hunt down and destroy this new player.<br />
<br />
But first things first.  He had a meeting.  Standing he walked over to his personal teleport pad and activated it.  In a moment he was on the other side of the nation.  The meeting was an international conference of billionaire businesspersons.  He was the only male. <br />
<br />
The meeting was was absurd.  Half the talk was about organizing charitable work, as if that ever accomplished anything.  These women might be larger and more confident but they were still women, still focused on emotion more than reason.  Charity was like placing a band-aid on a cancer.  You couldn&#39;t fix the reprobates of the lower class by giving them hand-outs.  What they ought to be talking about was how to lobby politicians.  Only by consolidating power could they affect real change and improve the world for the people who actually produced value.  But what would women know about producing anything other than babies?<br />
<br />
Eventually he couldn&#39;t help but let out a small but harsh laugh at the latest idiot suggestion, and the moderator of the discussion, an energy tech CEO named Jessica Stine, turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a waste of time!&quot; he said.  &quot;Your &quot;plan&quot; is completely unstructured altruism, which is self-defeating.&quot;  He went on with more detailed explanation for a bit, but the more he spoke the more he noticed impatience or even amusement growing on the faces of the women.  They weren&#39;t listening to him.  This made him angrier, and it only showed in his words, until he ended with &quot;But I suppose none of you are interested in anything but what makes you feel warm and tingly inside!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan I must say that that outburst was entirely unprofessional,&quot;  said Jessica, which resulted in a chorus of agreements.   <br />
<br />
One woman, Ally Walker of Walkertech, said &quot;A person who cannot offer criticism that is constructive and elegant should not speak.&quot;, triggering more indications of assent.<br />
<br />
Then another woman, Erika, said &quot;That&#39;s not fair, Ally, if we did that men would never be able to speak at all!&quot;   The room bust into laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; said Ally, and the laughter increased.  Jessica tried to quiet the room and scold them for the inappropriate jokes but she was clearly stifling a laugh herself.<br />
<br />
Ryan had had enough.  The women of this world were intolerable. He stood and spoke again.  &quot;This world where women rule is absurd!&quot;  he raged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh goddess, he&#39;s a masculanist nut.&quot; said one woman as she rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no need to get hysterical.&quot; said Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Women wouldn&#39;t know how to run a lemonade stand, let alone a company!&quot; continued Ryan, &quot;and I&#39;m going to take this world back for men, even if I have to defeat every one of you to do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan, sit down and calm down or I&#39;ll call security&quot; said Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it you stupid cunt.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
There were several gasps, and then silence.  &quot;Sit. Down. Boy.&quot; said Jessica with a growl.  The amazonian proportioned woman stood herself.  Ryan was big, but she was bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so.  In fact I think you can suck my cock.&quot;  More gasps, and Jessica motioned for security to be summoned, but Ryan only smiled.  &quot;In fact, you all can.  I wish every one of you was helplessly submissive to me.&quot;   It might be a bit foolish to waste ring charge on this, but he&#39;d had enough.  The happiness he&#39;d gain from dominating these cunts would go a long way towards recharging anyway.<br />
<br />
A change came over the women in the room.  Suddenly they were all looking up him with respect and fear.  Everyone would remember things as if they&#39;d always been that way.  So suddenly the whole room was wilting in shame and fear before his wrath.  Jessica spoke in a meek voice.  &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m so sorry, sir.  I don&#39;t know what I was thinking.  You&#39;re right.  We&#39;ll cancel the project.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled as he looked around the room, all of them now his bitches.  It wasn&#39;t a bad wish at all. With these billionaires under his control, he could start fixing a few things.  &quot;Of course we will, but I think you&#39;re forgetting something more important&quot; he said as he began to undo his belt.  The room gasped in shock as he freed his cock, which was of course 13 inches long thanks to a wish he&#39;d made long ago.  &quot;Dick sucking, remember?  Get over here, slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wish or not, it was still totally shocking, of course, for a man to just pull his cock out and demand a public blowjob, so Jessica had obvious reluctance, but she did not have will to resist.  &quot;Y-yes sir.&quot; she said, blushing with shame.  The amazon of a blonde crawled right over the table and with tears welling up in her eyes she went to work, applying her full lips to his member.<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned.  &quot;That&#39;s more like it, bitch.&quot;  he said as she began to suck him off.  &quot;See?  Isn&#39;t this easier?  Doesn&#39;t this feel right?  This is your proper place.&quot;  Then he grabbed her roughly by the hair and began to force her deeper down his cock.  She struggled not to gag, but managed to swallow him.  The rest of the room looked on with a mixture of horror, sympathy...and lust, but no one moved to stop it. It was uniquely scandalous, for with the new state of things after the wish they were still women raised in a world where women dominated, but it was sort of as if they&#39;d all had secret submission fetishes the whole time.  Simultaneously the power of this particular man just seemed to great to resist.  So as they watched him dominate a woman in ways that their world had scarcely even fathomed they had a sort of morbid but horny fascination.<br />
<br />
 Noticing one girl, Lillian, turn her head in shame ryan ordered her to watch.  &quot;I want ALL of your eyes trained on this.  This is your destiny, and the eventual destiny of every woman, but I&#39;m starting with the lot of you.  I&#39;m going to cum in every one of your holes before the night is done.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Ally couldn&#39;t help but sneak a hand up her skirt, overcome by lust at the unspeakably lewd site.  How was he...so powerful, this man who could command the whole room like this?  She didn&#39;t know, but it was everything she&#39;d always secretly wanted from a man but never dreamed she&#39;d be able to find.  She&#39;d tried to be discreet, but Ryan noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I give you permission to jill off, slut?&quot;  said Ryan, calling her out in front of the whole room.  She turned red as eyes fell upon her.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-n-no&quot;  she said with shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what?&quot; asked Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it, slut.  You will all address me as such.  Now strip for us, slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ally stood and began to strip, another girl, Miranda, had had enough.  She stood, bowed her head, and spoke, &quot;Master, this worthless horny slut begs the honor of being the next hole you use for your pleasure.&quot;  Miranda actually had a little experience subbing to other males, but this was different.  The placating wimpy males she&#39;d played with before had mostly just been playing at domination to please her.  This man...this hulking beast of a man, was different.  His was true dominance and power, and it turned her on so much that she didn&#39;t give a damn how shameful she was being.  She wanted it, wanted the shame even, for that just turned her on more.<br />
<br />
Ryan laughed.  &quot;Now that&#39;s a good girl.&quot; he said.  &quot;but no, I don&#39;t feel like fucking you yet.  I want to break some of the more willful ones first.  You&#39;ll be last.  Strip and then go kneel in the corner.  Watch but do not touch yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda bowed her head.  &quot;Yes, master.&quot;  She said.<br />
<br />
Ryan then picked up the pace as he face-fucked Jessica.  Never had any of the girls seen such brutal sexuality from a man.  &quot;Get ready to swallow you dumb cunt.&quot;  he said.  She moaned in aquiesance around his cock, and then he fired his load down her throat. Thanks of course to another old wish he stayed hard though. Ryan grinned as he pulled out and then whiped her face with his cock once.  She whimpered.  This one was about totally broken now.  He rested his cock on top of her head and chuckled.  &quot;Yes, that sounds like a great name.  With this cock I hereby <br />
dub thee Stupid Cunt.  You will always refer to yourself by that name whenever in private with me or other girls of my harem, and though you might still use Jessica with the less enlightened fools of this world, you will know that Dumb Cunt is your real name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes Master.&quot; said Dumb Cunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. Now, how about those even Dumber Cunts who made that joke about me?&quot; he said as his eyes fell upon Erika and Ally.  &quot;That will be your new names, of course.  There&#39;s no sense worrying too much about names for worthless holes, so you&#39;ll be Dumber Cunt 1 and Dumber Cunt 2.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The Dumber Cunts bowed their heads.  &quot;Yes, Master.&quot; they said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.  Now get over here, number 2.&quot; he said to the brunette one.  She hurried over and stood before him.  He didn&#39;t even bother giving her a command, instead turning her around and pushing her head down himself.  When she was bent over the conference table he lifted her skirt, tore down her panties, and buried himself in the big woman&#39;s snatch.  This too, was titilatingly shocking to the girls.  Usually sex occured in the amazon or cowgirl positions in this world.  Doggy was considered perverse, and even if it happened, the males of this world just didn&#39;t, well, fuck.  They submissively applied their penises where they were told to.  The language of the world spoke more of vaginas swallowing penises than of cocks penetrating pussies, and in fact most men&#39;s penises were rather too fragile for sex this rough.  but this...this could not be described in the terms the girls were familiar with.  This was clearly a cock pulverizing a pussy, and Dumb Cunt 2&#39;s eyes were practically bulging out of her head with shock and pleasure as she was truly taken for the first time. She moaned like the whore she now knew she was, and maybe always had been deep down.  &quot;Oh yes Master!&quot; she cried.  &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m cumming!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so, bitch.&quot; said Ryan.  He pulled out of her pussy, and then plowed into her asshole.  She cried out in pain, but he only fucked her harder until with a roar he came, but she did not.</p>
