<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You now have the body of a succubus, the only human things you have left being your head and your mind. Even your voice changed. You are overwhelmed. There was only one course of action for your brain: shutting down. It caused you to faint.<br />
<br />
You woke-up being shaken by one of the shop-keeper, a red-headed bombshell that seemed around your age. But you didn&#39;t stay too long looking at her, because you soon saw your reflection and were about to scream, when she put her hand on your mouth and with a bored look, asked &quot;You want to change back?&quot; When you frantically nodded against her hand, she said &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took you to what looked like a private make-up booth, and closed the door behind you. &quot;I can mitigate the change of your body, but not turning you back, sorry.&quot; Again, before you could scream, she put a hand on your mouth. &quot;But your soul is still intact, and I can make sure it wont change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How… How are you so sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because…&quot; You saw her slowly transform, her hairs now seemingly made of fire, her eyes turning into lava, gigantic horns growing out of her forehead and her skin turning to an unnatural shiny black, making it look like latex. &quot;… I was like you. But unlike you it was the mistress herself that took care of finishing my transformation. I&#39;m… I&#39;m only holding onto my human soul by sheer force of will… and I still can&#39;t disobey the mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could see the demoness wanted to cry. …And probably would have if she still had tear-ducts. Before you could express how sorry you felt for her, she added. &quot;But now things might change for the better. You see, the succubi costumes are a bit unstable, so when a client put on one we&#39;re supposed to help finish the change as soon as possible, so they stay an ordinary succubus. Thankfully the mistress insisted that the absolute priority is to make sure no one exit the ‘shop’ without trying on a costume. Or today I was alone and two clients would have done just that without my intervention, giving you enough time to become a princess. With a royal around, it should free from the mistress the few of us turned into succubi, maybe even some others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I… Wait, <strong>WHAT?!?</strong>&quot; You intelligently asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t need you to actually govern us, only to exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay…&quot;<br />
<br />
Still looking at you, the other demoness tilted her head. &quot;You seems to be of Asian descent. Do you want to stay that way, or do you want to use this opportunity to change ethnicity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Japanese to be precise. My grand-parents were from Hokkaid&#333;, so I might or might not have some peoples from the Ainu minority among my ancestors. And… And I want that to stay the same, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your interlocutor simply commented &quot;Oddly precise&quot; before taking a product in the right skin-tone and applying it all over your nude body. You could see it wasn&#39;t simply make-up, she was really changing your skin&#39;s color, and for good. She also applied it to your face, which made it become more feminine. The idea made you cringe a bit, but since you were stuck as a succubus, it was for the better.<br />
<br />
She then took a darker shade she applied on the areolas of both breasts. You were surprised to see the palm of your hands were slightly lighter in tone than the other side, (the same could be said about your wings) since she used the same product on both side, but weren&#39;t about to ask.<br />
<br />
The demoness then pulled out a plate with an assortment of horns. Before she could recommend any choice, you firmly sate &quot;No horns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but now we <strong>will</strong> turn your still human looking fingers into sharp talons. Technically we could let them as they are, but the mistress would be suspicious, especially since we forego the horns.&quot; She then proceeded to put back the plate of horns, before putting out the wrong plate of talons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? Oh, that&#39;s for a yuki-ona, not a Succubus.&quot; She was about to file away those ice looking talons when she stopped. &quot;On second thought we <strong>should</strong> use these. If you ever end up fighting another mythical, they would expect you to use fire based powers, not ice based ones. Plus yuki-onas are from Japan, it would make sense. Does it suit you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; you tactically shouted. &quot;Could you make it so my hooves look like that too?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded and started putting the ice-talons on top of each of your fingers. Each time you felt a great cold sink into your hand as a new talon fused with one of your fingers, but strangely it was a welcome sensation, a bit like that cold was a long lost part of you finally finding its way home. Same with the ones being fused with the lone claw you have on each wing. She then applied a product having the same kind of effect on your cloven hooves. Said hooves didn&#39;t just look to be made of ice, you could tell they were now just as sharp as your talons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we could also make my tail end with a blade in the same style rather than how it currently does? I hate how it simply end in a spade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be painful, but it can be done. That said, a client is about to go without putting on a costume. If I let that happen the mistress might come see what I doing, we can&#39;t have that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She came back a few minutes later and started to mold what looked like a naginata&#39;s blade made out of ice. Then she handed you a cylinder saying &quot;You should bit on this, it should help.&quot; You followed her instructions and she tore out the spade of your tail, causing excruciating pain, before putting the aforementioned blade in its stead. Once the blade in place the healing was quasi-instantaneous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you trust me to choose what hairstyle will look the best on you?&quot; Again you simply nodded and she put on you a simple black wig in a pixie haircut, something that wouldn&#39;t have looked out of place on a normal, perfectly human girl. &quot;Yep, I was right. You&#39;re definitely the ‘sexy tomboy’ king of girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper&#39;s comment made you blush. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now choose a pattern and a color for your eyes and I will concoct your new eyes. You can choose separate colors for each eye, but the pattern will be the same for both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at your possible pupils, you noticed there was nothing human-looking. Most were downright creepy, pushing you towards cat-like eyes. Now came the time to choose the colors. Here among the choices was things perfectly possible on a human, along with the most improbable color. You choose a tone of blue that was perfectly possible on a human, although not an Asian one, but you felt it was in line with your ice powers, so why not?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so cat-looking eyes,&quot; she took colorless contacts with said pattern &quot;clear-blue for color&quot; took solid blue ones and put them inside the cat-like ones &quot;and just so you look terrifying if someone royally piss you off wile your in your natural form, I will add this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will it do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make your eyes look like they are made of ice, but only if you get really fucking mad.&quot; she answered as she finished staking contacts. &quot;Now open your eyes!&quot; You obeyed and she put the two stacks simultaneously, one for each eye. It made you blink furiously as you felt the contacts merging with your eyes and changing them. Once this final part of your transformation ended, you look at your self in the mirror. You don&#39;t notice anything different in your vision, but since your pupils were currently very slim black lines lost in oceans of blue, you suspected your night vision had greatly improved.<br />
<br />
Now free to admire the rest of your nude body, you were forced to admit you were the perfect picture of the Asian sexy tomboy, although a version straight from hell. Honestly, if it had been the reflection of anyone else in that mirror, you would be more aroused than you ever were before, but it was <strong>you</strong>. It might be a new development, might only be you for the last few seconds, but it felt just as right than your old self had been, almost like you always were the lovely demoness reflected in front of you.</p>
