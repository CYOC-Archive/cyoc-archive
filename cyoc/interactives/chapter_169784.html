<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr Jenkins kept running from his pursuers, despite the pain that was now coursing through his body as the serum got to work. His insides felt like they were on fire as they began to shrink and reform. He tore at his shirt frantically, not wanting it to restrict his transformation and damage his chances of escaping.<br />
<br />
The doctor headed for a densely wooded area at the back of the Aviary, hoping to evade his pursuers and avoid drawing even more attention to himself. He looked back, only to see several Zoo staff gradually closing the distance as they approached.<br />
<br />
Jenkins shut his eyes and willed the changes to accelerate. This appeared to work as his body started to shift dramatically. Tiny pin pricks poked out all over his body as hundreds of feathers started to replace his human hairs. His chest was gradually adopting a smooth streamlined shape, while the beginnings of what would soon be a tail pressed out from the base of his spine. The bone structures of his appendages had also altered dramatically. His arms had started to bend backwards as they slowly morphed into wings, while his legs had begun to turn yellow as they shrunk into his body.<br />
<br />
All of these changes were making running almost impossible. Jenkins decided he had to have a quick break. He leant against a tree as his chest heaved and his body ached all over. He knew from looking down at his body that he was turning into some sort of bird: exactly as planned. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to get tangled up when he made his escape, Jenkins frantically tried to remove the rest of his clothes. He managed to slip out of his shorts and underwear as his legs shrank and thinned down. However he was too slow to remove his socks, which were gradually shredded as sharp talons grew on his increasingly bird-like feet.<br />
<br />
Now that he was essentially naked, Dr Jenkins could see that his changes weren’t far from finished. He was now considerably smaller, such that he was only about a foot tall. He now had distinctly avian features, including: a light and sleek body, a pointed tail, a set of wings tucked to his sides and a pair of boney yellow legs. Most of these features were adorned with a plumage of feathers, which sported an elegant brown and white flecked pattern.<br />
<br />
Jenkins did his best to keep hobbling away as he heard the Zoo employees getting closer. He knew what would change next, but he was determined to fight through the discomfort as he pressed forward.<br />
<br />
The doctor grimaced as he felt a tingling in his cock and balls. His flaccid penis suddenly jerked as he came suddenly onto the floor below. However, this sensation was more uncomfortable than enjoyable as his testicles quickly emptied themselves in preparation for the next change.<br />
<br />
Jenkins felt sick as his limp dick and deflated balls were pulled back between his legs. His genitals moved beneath his tail where his new avian cloaca was already taking shape. The developing organ throbbed as his cock and balls were steadily forced inside. The ring of flesh around the opening then sealed itself shut, leaving him with a fully-functioning sex organ.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, all that was left to change was Jenkins’ head. He groaned as his skull flattened and became more pointed. A sharp yellow and black beak pushout out in front of him as his eyesight became much sharper. His ears and nose soon receded into simple holes, while his scraggly hair was quickly forced out by more developing feathers. <br />
<br />
Jenkins let out a loud screech of relief as the transformation ended, leaving him as a majestic hawk.<br />
<br />
However, Jenkins didn’t have time to admire his new body as a member of Zoo security suddenly appeared in front of him. <br />
<br />
The large man reached out with a hand in an effort to subdue the elusive bird. However, Jenkins’ newfound instincts kicked in instantly. He flapped his wings frantically and took off, making sure to scratch the man’s vulnerable hand with his razor-sharp talons. <br />
<br />
The man cried out in pain as Jenkins soared into the air. Soon he was flying high above the Zoo as he made his escape.<br />
<br />
The doctor felt elated as he soared through the air. Some of the anxiety he had been feeling was replaced by relief and even happiness as he rose above the perimeter fence and headed towards a forested area off in the distance.<br />
<br />
Jenkins continued flying for what felt like hours until he was finally satisfied that he had lost his pursuers. He swooped down lower, hoping to have a rest after his exhausting transformation and escape. He was in luck as he saw what looked like an abandoned nest in a nearby tree. His instincts told him that it would be a safe place to spend the night. In any case he was too tired and mentally drained to think of an alternative.<br />
<br />
Having landed in the nest, Jenkins looked around to make sure that he was safe. Given that he was quite a large bird of prey he figured that most animals wouldn’t bother him. And so, as the light of the day started to fade, Jenkins settled down to sleep in his new nest.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Jenkins woke to find...</p>
