<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The ring did more than block attacks - Derrick struggled just to follow his stolen body, but remained still as a statue for what felt like a very long time.  When he finally was able to take a step he nearly fell over.  This minotaur form was much heavier and thicker than his teenage human body, and the massive muscles took some getting used to.  Derrick headed back for the main lobby, panic rising.  He had to tell the hotel staff what had happened and get his real body back before the fake Derrick left the resort and trapped him here forever!<br />
<br />
He trudged through the caverns and passages, getting more confused with every turn.  Why hadn&#39;t he paid better attention to where the minotaur was taking him?  The stone passages looked the same.  Finally, he spotted a huge, shaggy form ahead.  Another minotaur!  &quot;Mooo!&quot;  His attempt to call out was a bellow, but the creature stopped and looked at him.  It appeared to be identical to the first, and he supposed to himself now.  More attempts to talk only came out as grunts and bellows.  The other minotaur listened, then pointed down the passage it was heading down.  Had it understood?<br />
<br />
Derrick decided it was his only chance, and started moving down the indicated passage.  He could manage the body better now and worked up to a thudding jog.  There was a much smaller form ahead - a satyr carrying two jugs of wine.  It moved aside to let him pass, then looked surprised when he tried explaining.  &quot;You know I don&#39;t understand minotaur, right?  If that even is a language.&quot;  Desperate, Derrick tried pantomiming pulling the ring out of his nose, then indicating he had transformed.  After watching with amusement for a minute or so, the satyr points down the passage.  &quot;Tell it to management.  Take the second left and go all the way to the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Management!  Yes!  Derrick trudged off in the indicated direction, feeling much more at ease.  He could move smoothly, and had to admit the powerful body was starting to feel pretty good.  Not that he wanted to stay a minotaur, but it might be interesting as a short-term thing.  Just how strong was he?  And there was a lot hanging between his legs that would be...  Derrick pushed that out of his mind.  No!  he needed to get himself human again!<br />
<br />
The second hallway came up and he made the turn, nearly running into a centaur hauling some large crates.  The burly male scowled.  &quot;Watch it, Bully!  You aren&#39;t the only one working down here!&quot;    Derrick tried pantomiming again.  After a minute, the centaur snorted.  &quot;No good.  Keep going down the hall, all the way to the end.  Minotaur Management is there.   Maybe they can get you sorted out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick snorted in disgust and continued down the passage.  For all his mass and strength, minotaurs were not built for running, and he slowed to a steady stroll that still covered ground pretty quick.   The fear was lessening a lot - he was still anxious to get changed back, but the longer he stayed in this body the more he liked it.   What if this was all part of the resort&#39;s program?  The guy had just said it would be a funny trick if he made off with Derrick&#39;s identity, not that he actually would.  But Derrick had a funny feeling that he needed to hurry.<br />
<br />
Which made it all the stranger a few minutes later when he realized he had adopted the shuffling, plodding walk he had seen the other minotaurs use.  It was steady and purposeful, but not very fast.  Derrick tried to urge himself faster, but kept slipping back into the slow gait.  What was the rush, anyway?  His family wasn&#39;t leaving for a long time yet.  And he had wanted to go with the minotaur - in truth, he had been excited when he first felt the changes start.  So now he had his wish.  Except...  he was almost positive he did not want to stay a minotaur forever.  The body felt really good now, almost like he&#39;d been born into it, and he was enjoying the sensations.   There was a lot to experiment with, a lot to learn.  He could...  Derrick shook his massive head and forced himself to concentrate.  He had to get switched back!  What if the fake Derrick took off on his own?  Left the resort without his family?<br />
<br />
A spot of light ahead broadened into a wide opening into a sunlit field.  Rich scents wafted through the air, and he discovered that the source was a herd of cattle.  He blinked, looking for any sign of an office, but all he could see were cows, bulls, and calves.  The smell of females was strong, and he found himself reacting.  It was getting harder to hold onto his determination to get changed back.  He felt so good, so strong, so virile.  Lust crept into his thoughts, animal instincts getting stronger.  <br />
<br />
Derrick stared at the herd of animals, automatically shuffling towards them.  His nostrils picked out several females in heat.  It would be so great to mount one, to see what it was like.   <br />
<br />
**************<br />
In a remote control room, the former minotaur grinned as he watched the monitor showing a massive black minotaur fighting a losing battle with lust.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna have to thank the guys for steering him out to the pasture for me.  With any luck, he&#39;s going to willingly end up hauling baggage for tourists while I get to start over as him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The centaur guard with him chuckled.  &quot;I bet you a dozen drachma that he fucks himself onto four legs and spends the rest of his life making baby cows, and then gets served as sirloins.&quot;</p>
