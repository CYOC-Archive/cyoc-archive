<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A small satisfied smirk was plastered upon Fukushu&#39;s face as he now entered the Normal factory. For the kitsune his week in his homeland had proven quite fulfilling.<br />
<br />
It started when he talked with Akiras prized student Natalia MacGregor, the dhamphir his former pupil had trained in the ways of the kitsune warrior. Fukushu had been impressed by the woman, her skill in combat made her a formidable opponent, one who even the nine tail found to be a challenge. It had also given him time to talk with not only Natalia but his family as well.<br />
<br />
The dhamphir had proven to be the easiest of these conversations. For the both of  them, they realized that their lack of interaction over the years made for more comfortable conversations. Yes, Natalia had heard rumors of Fukushu but she was withholding judgement, especially with Akira sitting by her side. It made for an at first awkward conversation that eventually became one of respect. Natalia understood that Fukushu was trying to amend for his past, to help and no longer hinder and it was thanks to Darren. When Natalia departed, the pair had left things cordial.<br />
<br />
Mending the ties with his family also proved fruitful for the kitsune. For almost a century the nine tail had cut ties from his family, battling their allies in his quest for revenge. Returning in their darkest moment to aid them had been a start however, this latest trip allowed him to once more strengthen his familial ties. Fukushu now found himself talking with his siblings, mending the relationship with his mother, and meeting nieces, nephews, and spouses of his siblings for the first time. It was odd for the kitsune, lowering his defenses as kits he had no knowledge of approached him, spouses nervously introducing themselves after years of hearing of the vengeful kitsune. Fukushu though remained polite, reintroducing himself to his family, partly for his son but also for himself. In the end, the kitsune found himself happy and for that he thanked the Catalyst for giving him a chance.<br />
<br />
Now though, Fukushu had business to attend to. It had been too long since he had visited the Normal factory. As he strode through the factory he could see workers glancing up at his human form, offering a slight nod or wave as he passed them by. Despite his anger at humanity he in turn responded, he had no quarrel with these people. The Boss though was a completely different story. <br />
<br />
Entering into the Bosses office, the kitsune began to transform. His features shifting into vulpine proportions, his mouth extending into a muzzle, orange fur  covering his body, as nine tails fanned out behind him. It was an admitted guilty pleasure tormenting this braggadoceous man.  For too long the Boss had thought himself better than anyone, useing his immense power to intimidate and get his way. That was not the case with Fukushu and the kitsune loved nothing more than cutting his ego down to size. As he now gazed at the man behind his desk, a smug smirk spread across his vulpine face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you miss me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t say that I did,&quot; the Boss sighed. &quot;I was hoping your little vacation would have lasted longer.&quot; Fukushu simply chuckled, slowly making his way towards the desk.  &quot;And what kind of a partner would I be if I left you to your own devices,&quot; he smirked. &quot;No Boss, I plan on being around for a very long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching the scowl form on the Bosses face now made Fukushu smile. Perhaps it was petty but needling the man&#39;s ego brought him great joy. &quot;Figured you would say that,&quot; the Boss grumbled. &quot;And I also figure it&#39;d be only a matter of time before you clue your little buddy the Catalyst into what I&#39;m up to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no need,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;He doesn&#39;t need the advantage and it will be much more fun watching you fail.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss simply furrowed his brow, he was growing tired of this kitsune. Fukushu was proving to be a major inconvenience to him. Fortunately for him, he was about to enact a plan that would finally rid him of Fukushu and get him everything he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a really high opinion of this kid Fukushu,&quot; the Boss smirked, to which Fukushu nodded. &quot;And I must say as annoying as you&#39;ve been you helped put an idea in my head. One that is one hundred percent going to work. Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused, wondering what the Boss was getting at when he suddenly felt the floor shift beneath him. Caught off guard, the kitsune watched as his legs began to sink jnto the floor as if he was standing in quicksand. Grunting he now tried to free himself, sinking deeper until he found himself waist deep in whatever the floor had become. Just as quickly, whoever had cast the spell stopped, leaving Fukushu immobilized. <br />
<br />
&quot;Neat trick huh,&quot; the Boss smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;One that will cost you your life,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;You do realize it will only take a moment to free myself.&quot; The Boss nodded, Fukushu now noticing Casseus, Choon Hee,  Ann, a goblin, and a teenager Fukushu vaguely recognized. &quot;You remember Morgan&#39;s apprentice Rick right,&quot; the Boss asked. &quot;Because he remembers you and yes I know you can free yourself before we could even hope to harm you. But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu watched as the Boss gave a nod towards the goblin, the small creature pressing a button as a massive portal now sprang to life. &quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s been a pleasure but we both know I&#39;d be lying,&quot; the Boss smirked. &quot;See you later.&quot; Wothout another word the Boss and his minions now stepped through the portal, Fukushu watching it close immediately and leaving him wondering what had happened.<br />
<br />
***********************<br />
<br />
Making his way to Yurikos, Darren now found himself conversing with his friends as he prepared for yet another lesson. Things had been quiet since his return from the kitsune kingdom, the teen enjoying some much needed quiet time. <br />
<br />
Quiet time is what Darren had need though. After spending a day with the kitsune he had returned home, where he and Misaki had promptly gotten into a fight before breaking up. For the group of friends they found themselves now trying to comfort the pair individually, hoping to not break up the group of friends. &quot;Steph it&#39;s nobodies fault,&quot; Darren sighed. &quot;We both kind of decided it was better for us to not be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Steph replied sympathetically. &quot;But, Hannah and I are just worried about you that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus me and Crystal don&#39;t want to take sides,&quot; Hannah added. &quot;I mean you&#39;re my best friend amd all but I really need more than just one girlfriend to hang around with. Besides we both know she would kick your ass in a fight.&quot; Darren raised an eyebrow, before chuckling softly. Hannah always had a way of cheering him up.<br />
<br />
As the trio now approached Yurikos home, Darren paused, something didn&#39;t feel right. Turning around his eyes went wide as a wave of distortion now quickly made its way towards the group. Darren wasn&#39;t quite sure what it was, but it felt wrong. Something wasn&#39;t right and it was moving too fast, there was no way the trio would be able to make it to Yurikos in time. <br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s eyes now began to glow as he cast a spell, Steph and Hannah finally noticing the wave as it washed over them. Both Soul Drives now froze, fearfully looking at Darren as the teenager now focused. Whatever was going on, he needed to keep his friends safe.<br />
<br />
As quickly as the wave enveloped them, it passed. Steph, Darren, and Hannah confused as they carefully looked themselves over. &quot;What was that,&quot; Hannah asked. Darren had no answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren?&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, Darren now turned surprised by what he saw. All of his friends now stood behind him. Robbie, Crystal, and Misaki appearing just as confused as the others. Stranger still was the presence of Ewart, Gail, Pam, Stella, Neela, and both Raiden and Sachiko. &quot;Whats going on,&quot; Gail asked. &quot;I was just grading papers. What am I doing here?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Misaki called.<br />
<br />
Darren and the others now turned, their jaws falling a gape as they gazed at Yurikos home. Instead of the house they had grown so accustomed too, in its place stood a dilapidated and obviously abandoned structure. &quot;What happened,&quot; Robbie gasped.<br />
<br />
Darren had no answer, something terrible had occurred that none of the teens could come even close to answering.</p>
