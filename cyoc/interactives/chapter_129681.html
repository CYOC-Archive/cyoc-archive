<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A black dress with matching heels that shimmered in the sunlight and a frilly brown wig lied in the bush, undisturbed. Lifting them out, you began to grow curious as to why anybody would leave their belongings like this. It certainly wasn’t normal behavior, especially with something so beautiful like this. The fabric in your hand sent shivers down your back as a tinge of curiousity gripped you. Images of what your old form would have looked like in this popped up in your head before they were replaced by this new form. After a few minutes of debating, you came to a decision.  You just had to try on this thing on! Nobody was around to see you, and it would only be for a minute...<br />
<br />
Slipping the folds of the dress over your shoulders, the dress fit your body like a glove. Effortlessly, your arms were guided into each hole. The interior material would run against your chest chest and skin lovingly as it revealed your smooth chest and abs. A growing petrusion near the waist showed your excitement at being inside of such a stunning garment. Your hands would rub against your clothed chest for only a moment or so until you realized you had forgotten something. The wig lied on the ground nearby, awaiting for its new owner to don it. You picked it up before noticing it’s inside. <br />
<br />
A beautiful pearl necklace lied inside. Gently cupping your new jewelry, a thumb traced over them with the ever most care before gently slipping it on. Now free to put on the wig, you pushed your hair back as best you could before pushing it down on your head. But something was still missing! The final piece to this puzzle of beauty. The heels were filled with your feet, wiggling your toes inside. <br />
<br />
Moving to the water’s reflection, you were taken back by what you saw. Your previous handsome body had now been redressed in female clothing. You looked like a drag queen minus the make up. The longer you looked at this anomaly in front of you, the more you leaned in. Edging ever so closely to the water, you eventually lost your balance and fell back in. It took you a second to realize your error before it happened. <br />
<br />
Your muscles grew a small amount as the water brushed against them. The dress would hold it with surprising strength as your entire body would pulse until you looked about in your mid-twenties. Your rock hard cock would twitch at the sensation, growing in size until stopping just short of seven inches. A breeze through your hair revealed the wig had come off fully. As you grabbed it, the hair on your head would soon fall away into the waters below. Now bald, it would be placed on your barren head and fit comfortably. <br />
<br />
Climbing out of the water, you looked over yourself for any signs of change but were unable to see. Looking back in the water’s reflection, you found it had remained the same. A hand went to your manhood as it felt around out of curiosity. Just before a sigh of relief could come, more happened. A layer of foundation would appear as every imperfection of your face’s skin was hidden. More would begin to appear shortly after. As layer after layer was put on, you found yourself wanting even more while you began to jack off your own rock hard penis. <br />
<br />
When it had finally stopped, the shade of skin on your head was a much different color than your skin, comically so. Blinking in disbelief at what was going on, the next addition was eyeshadow and eyeliner. It continued applying itself until it looked overdone and outrageous. Just what you loved about it. “I look...” You stopped, surprised at the sound of your voice. It was deep, but had a prominent feminine lisp. “...fabulous!” Fears welled up in your chest but it felt hard to finish your words. Your mind was a haze of scattered information. Desperately trying to remember your female body, no such memories matched. You were always a guy, unfortunately. But now you were the best of both worlds! No more being some boring old youth!<br />
<br />
Continuing to pleasure yourself, lipstick was soon placed onto your lips as they brightened to a red color. Your throat became more pronounced as your Adam’s apple stuck out but hid well behind the dress’s neckline. Not that anybody would really be fooled, with that masculine jawline that your fingers traced over. The shoes would shoot a wirey substance up your legs. Lifting up the dress showed that a silky pair of pantyhose had been made as your hand on your cock was inside. <br />
<br />
Reaching a crescendo of masturbation, you felt amazing like this! Whatever had gotten into you felt so natural like you had always been repressing this. A few more pumps before your balls tightened. You shot your load into your pantyhose and became lost in the bliss. Your eyes rolled to the back of your head before a dark presence made itself known inside of you. Instead of fighting in this weakened form, you welcomed it. It spread throughout you as such naughty thoughts entered your new mind. Things like getting fucked raw by a train full of hot guys, sucking off cock, anything perverted you were for! Waving a few fingers, a wicked smile formed in your lips. <br />
<br />
“Such a wonderful body.” You said, standing up and looking over your form. A hand brushed by your cumstained cock as you giggled to yourself. A quick gyration of the hips to rub your legs into the sticky mess. “Now to find some unlucky fellow into a fucktoy. But first...” <br />
<br />
Gazing around, you searched around the bush from before and found a beautiful silver ring. “Aha! There you are.” Slipping it into your finger, a rush of magic flowed through you, snapping a finger as a flame appeared on your fingertips before doing the same motion to cancel it. Rubbing your large chest, you began to walk through the woods, swaying your hips with every step oozing of sexuality. It wouldn’t be long before you soon ran into...<br />
