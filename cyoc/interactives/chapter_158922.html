<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day was a blur after that. Amy served whoever came with perfect execution, feeling nothing notable aside from a gentle satisfaction at carrying out her Master’s orders. The only thing she could truly pay attention to were those two words her Master told her earlier. The phrase ‘Good girl’ kept bouncing around her porcelain head. Her day kept going on, however, with her hoping that she could hear that phrase again. Why she liked that phrase was beyond her. Why the though of her being a gothic porcelain doll was also beyond her. <br />
<br />
She was brought out of her auto-pilot stupor when she noticed herself becoming lethargic, and the ticking of her gears slowing down quite a bit. While it should’ve been alarming, Amy had some amount of faith in her Master to come back and wind her back up. The doll eventually made her way back to the counter, just when she felt the ticking of her gears stop. She was still, and felt herself drifting into a sort of sleeplike state. <br />
<br />
Amy’s short sleep was interrupted by the feeling of a pair of hands on her key, followed by a flood of energy with each turn. Her Master had returned to wind her up, just as she knew he would. The doll stood up straight, clasping her hands on the front of her skirt, and turned around to look up at him. <br />
<br />
	“You’re back, Master?” The doll question, her voice still quiet and carrying that slight english accent. Her eyes were turned up to him, face neutral as she waited his reply.<br />
<br />
“I am, little doll. I realized I forgot to give you something, so I brought a gift that I spent the day making.” He replied, conjuring forth a pair of mary janes that had a low heel on them. They looked like they would give Amy another inch or two of height. The bald wizard offered them to her, smiling lightly.<br />
<br />
Smiling back at him, Amy took the shoes, and went to put them on. She was interrupted by her Master speaking up.<br />
<br />
“But before you put them on, I have one question for you, little doll,” He added, holding a finger up, “Are you enjoying being my doll?”<br />
<br />
Amy blinked, not immediately having the negative answer she imagined she might have to that question. It was hardly unpleasant, she did enjoy helping people around the shop, and simply being a doll. The experience was very comfortingly serene. She had few worries, with her few worries being whether or not she actually could answer a person’s question about the merchandise being sold. <br />
<br />
	The doll bent down, setting her shoes on the ground. As she stepped into them, she gave her honest answer, finding no need to lie to him. Amy didn’t take much notice of the shoes grafting and sewing themselves into her feet like the rest of her outfit had.<br />
<br />
“I don’t dislike being your doll, Master. It’s hardly an unpleasant experience, but my only concern is my lack of concern for… Well… turning back.” She answered, her soft voice as genuine as it ever was. <br />
<br />
The bald wizard’s smile widened a bit. “Would you like to stay my doll for one more day and think about it?” He proposed, clasping his hands behind his back. <br />
<br />
	Amy could hardly find a reason not to. It was only a day, right? Then she could turn back, and go see Lina and her family. What harm was being gone another day, anyways? Her parents would think she was at Lina’s, and Lina would probably just think she was sick. Yeah, it would be okay. <br />
<br />
	With her answer, the doll turned her head up to her Master and nodded. <br />
<br />
“Excellent,” The wizard smiled brightly, “I’ll return in another day, and we’ll see what we want to do then. Oh, and I must add that you did very well in the shop today. Good girl.”<br />
<br />
Amy felt her lips curl up into a gentle smile as she heard that phrase again. She was a good girl, wasn’t she? The two words bounced about her head for a while before fading into memory. Her Master turned and disappeared in a flash again, leaving Amy to her own devices yet again. That smile stayed on her face as she moved to the register, eagerly awaiting the next person she could serve, all while those two words bounced around her head again.<br />
<br />
Throughout the slow day, she weighed whether or not staying as her Master’s doll would be what she really wanted or not. It was a back and forth debate in her head. On the one hand, she did very much enjoy being a doll with a simple life and purpose. It also helped that she felt quite pretty with her outfit now completed by the mary janes that covered her feet. They matched her outfit perfectly with little frilly white accents, and a pair of bows on the outsides of the shoes where the strap connected.<br />
<br />
What was she thinking about? Amy lost her train of thought upon her shoes coming to the front of her mind. Time must’ve flown by, as before long she felt herself start to wind down again. This was swiftly righted by her Master’s hands gripping her key and winding her back up, filling her with energy and movement yet again. <br />
<br />
“So, little doll, what’s your verdict? Do you want to stay like this, or turn back to your old self?” Her Master asked, prompting Amy to turn around.<br />
<br />
She’s thought long and hard on this throughout the day, so the answer came easily to her...</p>
