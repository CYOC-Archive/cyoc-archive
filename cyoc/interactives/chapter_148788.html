<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad doesn&#39;t know what to think.  He knows he woke up late Saturday morning reeking of Dirk&#39;s body odor with a red pubic hair in his mouth.  But he couldn&#39;t have been Dirk&#39;s new wrestling singlet, could he?  He would remember something like that.  Wouldn&#39;t he?  His memory was like Swiss Cheese of late.  The wrestling match video time stamp was Friday evening after he blacked out at 4 PM. Dirk had mentioned living 24/7 in his old singlet, and after this season, he might wear the new singlet 24/7.  Was that a threat?  Chad shivered.  It wasn&#39;t possible.  And what did Rico have to do with- He clicked on the next video.<br />
<br />
It was Rico again partially obscured, the camera was positioned with him near the camera, so his head was cut off. Dirk was fully visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Voila, Chad materialized right where I told you he would, right when I said he would,&quot; Dirk said offering Rico the singlet to Rico.  Rico stepped forward with his head to the back of the camera, and took the singlet.  He was butt naked.  He held the pouch so you could see Chad&#39;s face on the pouch.  He looked like he was sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure he won&#39;t remember this, Dirk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  He may wake up sore depending on what you do while wearing him though,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your singlet, is it clean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Urk, after I tossed him through his bedroom window and on to his bed, it took an hour for him to revert to human.  He didn&#39;t get up for at least 2 more hours, and then he spent at least an hour in the shower, while I mowed my lawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I wash him before putting him back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No reason to, he&#39;ll just think he got sweaty in his sleep and take a long shower.  The thing is you cannot put the singlet in the dryer, and once he&#39;s not worn, he begins reverting, so he may wake up naked on your clothesline, if you do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, got it,&quot; said the mystery voice, &quot;But how do I make him something other than your singlet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, you have to specify what you want while he&#39;s still human, and then when the change is scheduled he will become the described object.  Be specific, if you want a racer Speedo size 28, specify that.  If you just say swimsuit, he could become anything from a Rio Thong Bikini to a full body suit, and he might be too big or tooo small for you to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
The naked guy stepped into the singlet. His manhood obliterated Chad&#39;s face.  He was soon jerking off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Chad won&#39;t remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you show him a video of it, he might, but if he does remember anything, he will think it was a dream or nightmare. Don&#39;t tempt fate by ruining a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you talked to Chad about your singlet, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only obliquely to see if he remembered anything.  Besides he came over to me attracted by my body odor.  He may start hanging out with you after you wear him a few times,&quot; Dirk said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; said the voice thoughtfully.  He blew his load, and Chad the singlet absorbed it all in about 30 seconds.  &quot;Ooooh, he&#39;s hungry.  After he consumes a few dozen loads, you think he might start giving blow jobs when human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it, but don&#39;t mess with him while he&#39;s human.&quot;<br />
<br />
The video ended.  Chad clicked on the next.<br />
<br />
This one showed the lower half of the naked man straddling a bench in the locker room.  There was a flash of light, and a Speedo materialized in front of him on the bench.  Chad could see his elbow as he pumped his fist in the air, and said, &quot;Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook the Speedo so air filled the pouch, and Chad&#39;s face was visible on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Bruno doesn&#39;t know it, but if I make the swim team, he&#39;ll get his wish because you&#39;ll be on the swim team, well at least on one of the swim team,&quot; the voice snickered.  He put Chad on.  There was a bad cut, and then video of the young man diving into the pool and doing laps wearing ChadSpeedo.  Chad recognized the swimmer and gasped, &quot;Rico.&quot;  The video ended with Rico peeling off the Speedo, and setting it on a silk screen, and applying a QR code.  It looked like the new tattoo on Chad&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Chad softly, as the video ended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said a familiar voice behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Chad swung around so fast his dick flopped from side to side, and it was totally erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, looks like being worn turns Mr. Quarterback on,&quot; laughed Rico.<br />
<br />
Chad awkwardly tried to conceal his 10 inch boner with his phone and hands.<br />
<br />
Rico laughed harder, as Chad&#39;s cock head smooshed against his phone screen, and another video started.  Chad pulled the phone away to stop it, and foot long string of cum stretched between his cock head and the phone screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Chad, you were supposed to answer your door.  I had a whole script planned out about what to say, but you didn&#39;t answer the door.  Now we don&#39;t have time for any witty banter.  Let&#39;s  go into your foyer, so I can video you actually changing instead of just materializing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Chad asked.  He had managed to pause the video. Rico put his hand around the back of Chad&#39;s neck and pushed him out of the bathroom, and into the hallway, and toward the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rico, what are you doing in my house?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit slow on the uptake?  Maybe too many tackles or maybe it&#39;s a side effect of having a Spandex brain?&quot; Rico commented.  Chad didn&#39;t seem able to resist.  They were now standing in the foyer with Chad in the center of the decorative stone circle inlaid in the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait how did you get in?  The door&#39;s bolted,&quot; Chad protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I climbed through the window while you were watching our website, Chad Pwned.  Remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot be a singlet or Speedo.  This is some sort of - oh, oh, I feel so sluh-eepy?&quot;  Chad yawned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!  Video time!&quot; Rico said raising his phone and beginning to film naked Chad who seemed torn between rubbing his eyes, and covering his crotch.  His skin turned blue.  Rico cheered.  A confused Chad raised his arms like a champion, and then....</p>
