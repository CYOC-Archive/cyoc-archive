<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish Bryan was the same size as the next photo of a man he sees in his magazine,&quot; said Matt pointing the wand at his unsuspecting neighbor.  Then he grabbed a pair of binoculars and zoomed in on his victim.<br />
<br />
Bryan was studying his bodybuilding magazine.  He practiced the isometric exercise being demonstrated in the photo series. Then he turned the page, and watched in amazement as the 7 inch tall model doing jumping jacks in the next photo story start to grow.  He couldn't take his eyes off the growing bodybuilder. As he stared the guy soared to at least 3 feet and he was still growing.<br />
<br />
Matt's shorts tented as he watched the neighbor boy flexing his arm as he started to shrink on his bed.  Matt could tell that Bryan hadn't figured out what was happening.  He just gaped at the magazine picture, instead of running for help.  Matt paused, he hadn't thought this far.  How was he going to get his hands on little Bryan.  Perhaps he should have shrunk 13 year old Brett in the backyard, or waited until Bryan came out of the house.  Now he had to think fast.<br />
<br />
He shoved the wand and paper back in the drawer, and grabbed his gym bag.  He was sure that the shrunken Bryan would fit in that easily.  Then he ran over to the DeSoto's.  He still needed an excuse--Bryan and he went to the same school, perhaps it could be a question about an assignment.  That would get him admission to the house, then he'd just have to keep Bryan from raising the alarm, and then he could write a note for Bryan, and tell his brother or dad that Bryan must have already left.  They'd never think to look in Matt's small bag for a 6 foot tall young man.  He grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Brett, is your brother Bryan home?  I've got to talk to him about an assignment,&quot; Matt said causing Brett to miss his shot.<br />
<br />
Brett scowled at his weird neighbor, but answered civilly, &quot;Bryan's upstairs in his room, go on in, the door is open.&quot;  He turned back to his game, and smiled mischieviously.  Bryan would be none to thrilled about the rumors that might come out of his little brother mentioning that Bryan and Matt Laird were alone in Bryan's room.  Little brother's could always use black mail material on their older siblings, even if there was nothing to it.  It might still be worth a buck or two for Bryan to shut up Brett. He sunk his next basket.<br />
<br />
Bryan's perspective was shifting, and he realized the magazine wasn't growing. He struggled to stand his legs were lost in his now oversized boxers.  He managed to stand naked in his underwear, he couldn't be more than 2 feet tall, and he was still shrinking.  The three foot drop to the floor, now looked more like 9 feet, make that 10.  He turned his attention to the magazine.  He had started to shrink when he turned that page.  Maybe if he closed the magazine.  It was now almost as big as he was.  He reached down and lifted, it felt like when he'd helped his dad rip out the old carpet.  It was so heavy.  He lifted the front cover up, but the slick back cover slid and he ended up spmersaultingover the cover and lay sprawled in the middle of the open magazine.  He turned to look eye to eye with the guy in the picture.  They were the same size.<br />
<br />
Just then the door swung open. He expected to see Brett or Don, they never knocked.  Instead he saw his neighbor and classmate Matt Laird smiling and carrying a gym bag.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Brian? Ah, there you are, and just what I need too, a musclemag to jack off in!&quot; his giant hands reached out and grabbed the magazine. He lifted slamming Bryan in between the glossy pages.  He heard a zipper, and then a brief comment from the giant, &quot;Darn, I forgot to wash my gym clothes.  Hope you don't mind? Well, actually, I don't care if you mind! Ha!&quot; Then he dropped the magazine containing Bryan inside the gym bag, and zipped it shut.  <br />
<br />
He grabbed a note pad from Bryan's desk, and wrote, &quot;Bryan, Sorry I missed you.  Need to talk to you about class assignment. Call me when you get in, Matt.&quot;  Then he hastily added his phone number.<br />
<br />
He rushed out of the DeSoto house, bumping into Brett who had decided to see what was happening in Bryan's room with Matt, &quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Brett. Bryan wasn't up there, so I've got to try to find someone else who knows about assignment.  I left him a note asking him to call me.&quot;  Then Matt was gone.<br />
<br />
Brett cursed under his breath, Bryan was going to be pissed that Matt was up in his room while he wasn't home.  He must have gone in early to work tonight.  The manager had been making him work overtime lately.  Brett grabbed a glass of water, and then went back to shoot hoops, unaware that his big brother had been abducted right under his nose in a gym bag by the nerdy neighbor from next door.</p>
