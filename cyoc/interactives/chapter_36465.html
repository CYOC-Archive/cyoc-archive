<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben the week long judge of a panel of judges for the 4-H exhibit, did wander off to the fair grounds, if to get an eye, ear full as what he would need to be a judge the next day.<br />
<br />
Most of the animals in the bug barns had crunched down to lie there half asleep but listening. As Ben did walk the three main aisles of the barn and between the many animal pens, he could here some odd sounds; as if someone was moaning and hurt.<br />
<br />
Concerned for anyone in pain, Ben likely dashed up and down the stalls, checking in each of the hundred or so there in that barn.<br />
<br />
One checking done, he bumped into a night watchman, and showing the papers of his placement as a 4-H judge on the morrow, he asked the security man to help him look for who might be hurt as he had heard them moaning.<br />
<br />
Later, after what did happen to Ben he told me of his vague memories of a few weeks in hell.<br />
<br />
The interview with that night watchman proved enlightening as well, he made a report of the incident and of a missing judge who never showed up to handle his judging duties. <br />
<br />
Ben remembered the beginning of his early stages. As he checked a second time about the many stalls for someone hurt or injured; he rather expected that they would want to be found.<br />
<br />
Checking in a pen where a small group of goats stood huddled together in one far corner; as nearest to the aisle one big goat lay all stretched lengthwise, nestled into the cedar shavings the fair used as  bedding.<br />
<br />
He then heard a soft rather seductive sort of moan.<br />
<br />
Ben leaped the pen fence and began digging around in the foot thick bedding of that pen. His hand bumped something, then his other hand touched something lying covered by the shavings, and as well directly under the big goat.<br />
<br />
Instantly he thought in might be a youngster that fell into the pen and the big male goat was defending his herd from harm.<br />
<br />
Ben grabbed at the head of the goat, struggling with him to stand up and allow the person under him to get up and get out of the pen.<br />
<br />
Humorously surprised, Ben remembers that when the big goat stood up, as attached to his very erect maleness was the naked body of a college coed we knew as Melissa.<br />
<br />
Moaning and embarrassed beyond speaking words, Melissa hung suspended upon the stout erection of that male goat. <br />
<br />
Ben sat by her, knowing that it would be the softening of the goat shaft embedded so long, so deep, and of such girth, that it would take some time before Melissa would fall free.<br />
<br />
Ben remained quiet to keep the embarrassing situation of Melissa from becoming a newspaper story of bestial debauchery. he held her hand and sat quiet as Melissa tried to work her hands at forcing the goat to relax his grip to her...<br />
<br />
The touching of that goat by Ben set the elixir into motion, the first to show a change in species was as on the others, Ben got the shaggy maleness of a Boer breed of goat.<br />
<br />
He sat there feeling uncomfortable, and as the waves of change raked over his body, he became incensed with smelling of both the goat shaft and where he had it stuck.<br />
<br />
Melissa took note of how Ben changed in his normally calm and very moral thinking demeanor; becoming as much like the big Boer buck goat, until he began sprouting horns from his forehead.<br />
<br />
Melissa was of her own nature and known to love animals, mostly male animals, she could stand there watching a male animal and licking her lips with feelings of some anticipation. Ben said he noticed first how Melissa was licking her lips and eying him as if he was her next sexual conquest. <br />
<br />
The situation changed hands when the big buck did finally soften his grip in Melissa and she slid off his shaft with the slithering style of a snake coming out a hole in the ground. Ben remembered quite frankly how he saw it happen, and stuck the end to his changing nose, soon to be a goat muzzle, and poked it in and between two slender limbs.<br />
<br />
Melissa lay very quiet, her eyes wide with disbelief of seeing a fellow classmate changing into an exact duplicate of the buck she just had a... friendly relationship.<br />
<br />
Ben lost track of what happened after that, his mind awakening a various times, when he first thrust in, and as he humped over the back of Melissa, and when they were both so thrilled she noosed a rope about his strong neck and did coax her buck into cab of her Dodge truck.<br />
<br />
Again Ben had lapses in remembering what he was and did for what seemed almost an eternity. His moral and religious teachings by strict parents and a proper rearing caused even a crude minded big buck to feel leary of doing what Melissa would try and get him to enjoy.<br />
<br />
What in the essence of time was three weeks of many wild sexual pleasuring, the neighbors heard noises, moaning, a few screams and the bleating of a goat from in the rented rual house where Melissa resided.<br />
<br />
The police came and animal control took Ben from his happy home.<br />
<br />
Melissa had to pay a big fine for keeping a farm animal where locale zoning ordinances made it a crime.<br />
<br />
Penned, and luckily for his last full week before he would of spent a month as a goat in constant sexual heightened delights; Ben began to change on night. He changed enough to let himself out of his pen, running off into the night.<br />
<br />
The reformation of a young man to being human from spending a demoralizing 3 weeks time, he as a willingly lurid, male buck goat; as from it made for some horrifying memories. Changing slowly over the course of three days and four long nights, Ben arrived at our apartment, mostly naked, partially still cloaked in shaggy goat hair, and having the yellowest eyes seen by any other human.<br />
<br />
Two weeks after that morning when Ben returned to being like us who are human, he went to Melissa and asked for her hand in marriage.<br />
<br />
Two of our musketeer friends never returned from that foolish prank. Stan, sense and for the foreseeable future years is having a fun time as the prime Jutland stallion stud residing at the Killingsworth stables near the west end of the county.<br />
<br />
A blue ribbon winner at every county fair and the state fair too has filled his stud book to overflowing with owners of horses that they want Stan to grant some of his excellent equine conformations.<br />
<br />
Kevin, dearest friend, remains in his life of doggy debauchery, a stud male Rottweiler dog, his owner loans he boyfriend out for sire duties. She lets Kevin or Kiev as he is referred to now by name, he has Suzie to practice his doggy mounting and thrusting techniques. His other duties around home are not voiced openly, but whether by day or night, Kevin is honing in on somebody.</p>
