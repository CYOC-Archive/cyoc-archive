<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"We're not getting costumes, cutie," Ben said, turning around in his seat and looking at Rob with a lecherous smile.<br>
<br>
"Yeah," Tony said, looking at Rob the same way as Ben.<br>
<br>
Now Rob was really freaking out.  They were looking at him like he was a piece of meat.  He turned and tried to unlock the door to get out, but Tony was quick and reached around the seat to grab his arm, holding him there.  "Let me go, you asshole!" he yelled.  But Tony wouldn't.<br>
<br>
"Just hold him there, love," Ben said, winking playfully at Tony.  Then he got out of the car and then opened the door opposite of Rob.  He picked up the box sitting on the seat and sat down in its place.<br>
<br>
Rob just stared at him, thinking that Ben must have lost his mind.  That was it, right?  It had to be.  There had to be a reason why they were acting so weird.<br>
<br>
Ben reached over to Rob and began to caress his crotch, causing Rob to squirm.  "What the hell are you doing, dude?!" he yelled, shocked.<br>
<br>
"Just getting to know you better, honey," Ben said.  Then he opened the box that had been sitting on the seat and took out a small flowery pastel-colored packet.<br>
<br>
"What's that?" Rob asked.<br>
<br>
"Just something to help you loosen up."  He then placed it in Rob's hand.  "We were gonna wait until the party to use these, but there's no reason we can't use some of it now, for you.  There's plenty to go around."<br>
<br>
Rob lifted up the packet and read the label: "Gay Eye For the Straight Guy".  What the hell was this?<br>
<br>
"Go on, open it up and swallow it," Tony said, eagerly.<br>
<br>
"I'm not doing anything until you tell me what's going on," Rob said.<br>
<br>
"What's going on ..." Ben began, scooting a little closer to him, almost snuggling up against him.  "... is that that powder will turn you gay."<br>
<br>
"What?  You can't be serious.  You can't become gay by eating powder," Rob said.<br>
<br>
"Sure you can, honey," Tony said.  "We're proof of <i>that</i>."<br>
<br>
Rob looked at Tony, then at Ben.  They were serious, weren't they?  If this was true ... oh my god, Tony and Ben really were gay.  They weren't just pretending.  He didn't know how it could be possible, but the proof was right in front of him.  And now they wanted him to become a fag too?  No fucking way!<br>
<br>
He threw the packet on the floor.  "I'm not swallowing any of your shit.  I'm not gonna become some lisping twink boy for you.  You two can just go fuck yourselves."<br>
<br>
"Maybe later," Ben said, grinning.<br>
<br>
"Let me go, or I'll call for help," Rob said.  "I can yell really loud, you know."<br>
<br>
"A screamer, huh?  I bet that would sound so hot in the bedroom," Ben said.<br>
<br>
"I'm not kidding.  I'll scream," Rob threatened.<br>
<br>
"Hold him, love.  It looks like we're gonna have to do it for him," Ben said to Tony.  And with that, Tony's grip on Rob's arm tightened.<br>
<br>
Rob couldn't move.  He wanted to slug these two queers, but he was in a confined space and Tony was as strong as he was.  Ben picked up the packet from the floor and tore it open.  Then he moved the packet towards Rob's mouth.<br>
<br>
"Open up, honey," Ben said.  But Rob shook his head "no" and kept his mouth shut.  Ben just smirked, then launched himself towards Rob, locking lips with him.  Rob didn't think that he had ever been more disgusted.  A guy was kissing him!  And he felt his tongue in his mouth!  He felt like vomiting.  Ben backed off, causing Rob's mouth to drop open in shock ... and that was when Ben emptied the packet into his mouth.  That fucking asshole!  He did that just so he could get his mouth open.<br>
<br>
Ben put his hand over Rob's mouth, forcing him to swallow.  Rob just sat there, hoping that this was all just a prank.  Yeah, an elaborate prank.  Tony and Ben weren't really gay.  They were just playing around with him.  That powder was just sugar.  It didn't taste like sugar, but that must have been what it was, because it couldn't have been what they said it was.<br>
<br>
And then he began to feel ... different.<br>
<br>
Ben grinned, then asked "How ya feeling, sweetie?"<br>
<br>
Rob turned towards him, then smiled, liking what he saw, causing the bulge in his pants to grow.  He never noticed it before, but Ben was really hot.  <i>Oh gawd, I'm like so totally gay,</i> he thought.  But he didn't really mind it.  He liked men.  So what?  "I feel fabulouth," he said, his voice now higher pitched and with a lisp.  "You know, I think I'm gonna drop out of football.  Theeing all thoth hot thweaty guyth ith like a total turn on, but I think glee club ith more my thtyle."  Straight Rob hated glee club, but gay Rob had a passion for musicals and dancing.  He reached over and caressed Ben's crotch and smiled.<br>
<br>
"Easy, tiger," Tony said.  "Ben's mine."<br>
<br>
Rob pouted.<br>
<br>
"Don't worry.  We'll find you a man before the end of the night," Tony said.  Then he turned towards Ben.  "So now what?  Are we going in the store or what?"</p>
