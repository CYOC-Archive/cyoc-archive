<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somehow, finally, Chad managed to drift off to sleep. He wasn&#39;t asleep long however, as he suddenly felt himself being ripped off the ceiling, and rolled up into himself. He would have screamed with shock if he could, but he was still frozen. At least this time Jay had rolled him up backwards, so his face was on the outside on the bundle. Jay finished rolling him up, and grinned to himself as he looked down at the started eyes of the rolled up Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing this morning, poster boy?&quot; Jay asked, in a surprisingly kind tone - or perhaps he was simply mocking him. <br />
<br />
Chad just stared back up at the face of his gigantic owner, wishing he still had the capacity to move, or speak. The other jock squeezed Chad softly, before grinning, and sticking him underneath his arm for safe transit - unfortunately for Chad, this meant his mouth and nose where shoved directly against Jay&#39;s sweaty armpit. Chad felt disgusted as he was forced to sniff the other man&#39;s sweat, but another part of him felt aroused, and somewhere inside his bundled body, he felt a small twitch that must have been his cock. This is a nightmare, I want to wake up! Chad thought desperately to himself, as he closed his eyes and tried not to think about the jocks bushy armpit hair tickling against his face - or how much his cock was twitching from it.<br />
<br />
Jay whistled to himself as he carried the flattened jock underneath his arm, as he made his way to the bathroom. The pool of cum from last night had dried over his stomach, and he was in desperate need of a shower. Lucky for him, he had just the thing to clean himself off with.<br />
Chad felt a sense of rising dread as Jay stepped into the shower, turned on the taps, and began to adjust the warmth of the water until it was perfect. Jay stepped full underneath the stream of hot water with a content sigh, and let it wash across his face and body. Chad was in nowhere near as much comfort, as the water began to run off of Jay&#39;s skin, and down into his rolled up body underneath the other jocks smelly armpit. The water soaked into his body, making him heavy, and covering his face. He thought for a moment that he might drown, but found that he was oddly able to breath perfectly, despite the water clogging up his nostrils. <br />
<br />
Jay finally removed Chad from underneath his arm, and smiled down at him. &quot;I know you must hate me right now Chad...&quot; No shit, thought Chad in response. &quot;But look on the bright side; I&#39;ll be way better of an owner than the team would have been. They&#39;d have made you into a towel and taken you into the sauna, and made you absorb their sweat, smell their asses, and sniff their farts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad felt a shiver of disgust, before Jay kept speaking in a hushed voice. &quot;Not me though...I mean sure, you&#39;ll be doing that with me too...&quot; Oh great, Chad thought. &quot;But lots of other things too...its kind of a shame really, if you had of just been more honest about how you felt, we could be boyfriends right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay shook his head for a moment, before he gripped down on Chad&#39;s damp body, and began to scrub his face against his sweaty chest, cleaning himself off beneath the warm water. Chad tried to scrunch up his face as he was rubbed this way and that over the jocks body, but could do little more than close his eyes. He was forced to smell Jay&#39;s sweat and musk as he was dragged this way and that, and even felt some of last nights cum scrape across his lips, as Jay washed his belly. The jock was using him as a loofah! How could this get any worse?<br />
<br />
He soon found out, as over the next few minutes he was forced to clean other parts of Jay. He was shoved back underneath his smelly armpits, until they smelled fresh as a daisy. He was scrubbed over Jay&#39;s feet, cleaning them of the dirt, grime, and sweat from the day before. He was shoved into his sweaty ass-crack, and rubbed up and down until Chad was screaming for mercy inside his head. Because his face was on the outside, he saw, tasted, and smelt all of it. He was forced to taste the jocks sweat, sniff his sweaty ass, and kiss his dirty feet, and the worst part of it all, was that Chad knew he was enjoying it in some twisted way. He felt his cock throbbing inside of his rolled up body, and he wished more than anything that he could just move his arms, and jerk himself off.<br />
<br />
Jay moved Chad around in front of himself, and grinned down at the dripping former jock. &quot;Okay washcloth boy, time for you to get me off, and then I&#39;ll hang you out to dry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t like the sound of that, but quickly found himself conflicted, as Jay began to rub his face all over his cock and balls. Apparently the cleaning massage with Jay&#39;s former crush had gotten him quite hard, and Chad groaned inside his head, as he was forced to wash off Jay&#39;s sweaty balls, and breath in their scent. Jay let Chad unfurl quickly, and shoved the wet dripping 2D jock up against the wall over the shower. <br />
<br />
There was a lusty look in the jocks eyes as he stared back at the forever fixed face of Chad. &quot;I&#39;ve thought of doing this for so long...never imagined it quite like this though,&quot; he said with a laugh, before he planted a long kiss against the frozen lips of Chad. <br />
<br />
Chad was surprised, but after a few seconds, he began to enjoy it. He closed his eyes, and wished that he could lean back into his hot and athletics owners kiss. He felt something around his throbbing cock, and glanced down towards his hips. Jay had grabbed his surprisingly hard cock in his hands, and was beginning to rub it against his own, frotting the both of them to release as the warm water continued to rain down on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah, thats right Chad!&quot; Jay grunted, as he thrust his cock against the flattened jocks, pumping both of them together with his hand. &quot;Gonna be mine forever, gonna make you crave my cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad should have been horrified, but the longer it went on, the less and less he began to miss his former life. Jay was so fucking hot, and it felt so good to have his hand wrapped around his cock. Finally, after what seemed like an age, Jay groaned loudly, and came all across the jock-cloth in front of him. Chad was surprised and delighted to find that he was cumming as well, and spattered Jay&#39;s chest with a tiny amount of cum, that was quickly washed down the shower drain.<br />
<br />
Jay panted softly, and gave the flattened Chad another quick kiss, before rolling him back up into a ball, and turning off the shower. &quot;Didn&#39;t know you could cum, Chad...guess Rod left you and I that special, huh?&quot; he said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Chad was then unfurled, and left across a towel rack to dry - his vision upside down as he waved limply in the air. &quot;Now you just dry out for a couple of hours, while I go to class. When I get home, maybe I&#39;ll treat you to a nice cum facial!&quot; Jay said with a snicker, before clothing himself, and departing for class.<br />
<br />
As Chad hung there lifelessly, the only thing he found himself caring about, was how long he and his owner would be separated. He couldn&#39;t wait for him to come home.</p>
