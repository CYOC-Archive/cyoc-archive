<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It then hits you like a truck. The facts of this reality sinking into your consciousness, like a faded memory resurfacing. You frown for just a split second as against yourself you naturally dismiss her concern. <br />
<br />
&quot;No babe, come on in!&quot; You say with an eager smile. Conflicted feeling stirring inside, though the primary feeling you feel is curiosity. Though you know what comes next from those new memories flooding your mind you also keep your old ones. Many moments like an echo, almost the exact same, while others are different. <br />
<br />
Your girlfriend takes a step in, &quot;OOOOOkay.&quot; She raised an eyebrow before coming in and making herself at home. Flopping down on your couch with a smile. &quot;So you on birth control or am I going to have to wrap it up?&quot; She then asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I&#39;ll be good, babe. Don&#39;t worry about a condom.&quot; You would say, not fully realizing it until you said it. Your curiosity of who you were in this reality letting you function on a little bit of autopilot, you were still yourself and could control yourself but there were still patterns of behavior from this world that you would follow.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s why you would kneel down in-front of your girlfriend, hands going to her jeans and undoing the button. She still wore cute little panties at least, and indeed though it was slightly strange to see the outline of her cock against them it was also thrilling. You could feel your new vagina flush with eagerness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn you weren&#39;t lying this thing is huge!&quot; you exclaimed, peeling down her panties to let her cock free and it would spring forth and gently smack you across the face, leaving a small precum dot on your forehead. It must have been nearly 12 inches long, a foot long log of cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah~ I know guys don&#39;t really get too much out of sex, not being able to cum and all, so if nothing else I hope it stretching you can at least make you feel something?&quot; she said it with an intense blush, at least she was still the sweetheart you remember really liking.... and then the realization of what she just said hit you. <br />
<br />
Seems some of the old sexist prejudices and myths of the old world carried over to this new one, just in a different way. Vaginal orgasm was seen as a myth; and guys, though still expected to be sexually dominant, were the ones being used as fucktoys. And unlike your timeline, where feminism addressed a lot of this, because men were still the more socially powerful group and this arrangement benefited the ladies more there was less social agitation for equality within the bedroom.<br />
<br />
You could feel yourself drool a little as you gave her shaft a single long lick up it&#39;s length. Your girlfriend shuddered in pleasure as she gently wagged her dick, making it smack your face. And you couldn&#39;t help but growl in arousal. This was your place, or so it felt. &quot;That&#39;s a good girl, show me right were my place is~&quot; your tone firm and in control even as you debased yourself; the role of most men in this world. <br />
<br />
Your girlfriend blushed intensely and gave a soft huff, grabbing the base of her cock and giving your face several meaty whacks. &quot;A-ah. There!&quot; she exclaimed. Taking a few sharp breaths, &quot;You&#39;ll be my 20th, you know?&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;20th partner?&quot; You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, 20th virginity given to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
That hit you too, all that purity culture from your old reality. She was your first REAL girlfriend, sure you had dated in the past but you trusted her enough to let her have your virginity. After all it was kind of expected for girls to sleep around now and guys to wait until they found someone steady, though obviously that wasn&#39;t universal. <br />
<br />
&quot;T-thats hot.&quot; you couldn&#39;t help but mumble into her shaft. Giving her a few more licks before pulling back. Bending over the coffee table and exposing your cunt. Shuddering with desire even though you knew for a fact that she was gonna be rough to take. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s not keep you waiting, lets get you that milestone. And don&#39;t hold back on account of me, I&#39;m a tough guy. I can handle you.&quot; You gently ordered her, to which she responded with a simple nod. <br />
<br />
She stood up and slowly pressed the tip of her cock against your sex, you could feel the bulbous head split your outerlips. She almost seemed to be teasing before a thick glob of precum pushed it&#39;s way up and into your cunt, you could feel it&#39;s warm goodness. And then? She didn&#39;y hold back just like you asked. <br />
<br />
She slammed her little petite hips in as hard as she could, a gasp escaping you as she tore past your hymen with ease and stretched your cunt wide. It hurt and felt uncomfortable, and somewhere in the deep recesses of your mind that turned into a deep satisfaction beyond the light pleasure sex might have provided before... It felt so right as much as it felt wrong. <br />
<br />
Her dainty hips slamming forward and crashing into your rear and her balls swinging like a pendulum up against your belly which distended with every thrust. You were being broken on her and there was nothing more ecstatic and awful you had ever felt before. Your voice calling out in a slightly deeper register now, &quot;That&#39;s it use me! Property of your fat dick.&quot; <br />
<br />
It would feel like hours under that assault seconds passing slowly and minutes even slower. 20 minutes of getting your guts rearranged and your cunt absolutely blasted before she groaned, and without needing your permission and with no expectation of otherwise she held you deep onto her cock and groaned as thick creamy loads of hers shot into your cunt. Groaning in a soft, submissive voice. &quot;Aaaaahhh fuck.... take my seed.... bitch.&quot; her breathing heavy and she couldn&#39;t help but fall back onto the couch tired. <br />
<br />
Just as you couldn&#39;t help immediately turning around to kneel and clean her dick up with your mouth. Looking up and wondering to yourself what you would do next... a dominant fucktoy for this wonderful woman you loved.</p>
