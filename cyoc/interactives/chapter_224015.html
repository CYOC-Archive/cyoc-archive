<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You should prepare me&quot;, said Yasmine, still staring, entranced, at Lesily&#39;s crystal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose?&quot; said Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Rose pulled her hospital gown back on and padded over to where Lesily stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you like your new lover to look like? Any preferences?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose thought for a moment. &quot;Nope, I like her the way she is, so just make her a man. The same man she&#39;d be if she had been born male&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect!&quot; said Lesily, turning back to face Yasmine. &quot;Now then, Yasmine, you should take your clothes off&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take my... clothes off?&quot; said Yasmine, blushing some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you&#39;ll get really uncomfortable otherwise. You can keep your underwear on if you want&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yasmine nodded, kicking her shoes off before reaching down to pull her socks off. Then she took her shirt off smoothly and tossed it aside, getting quite a few catcalls, before pushing her Capri pants to the floor and stepping out of them to stand dutifully in front of Lesily. Her tan body was curvier and fuller-figured than Rose&#39;s, the deep olive cleavage of her breasts above a chubby midriff, wide hips, and rather heavy hindquarters. She was tidily shaved all over, with no hint of body hair. What seemed to surprise Rose the most, though, were the translucent lacy black bra and panties her friend was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit Mine, since when do you have those?&quot; said Rose, glancing at her own plain underwear on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping to get lucky on this vacation&quot;, said Yasmine emotionlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you will get lucky, just not in the way you expected!&quot; said Lesily, turning to wink at the audience before facing Yasmine again. &quot;Now then, Miss Yasmine, can you hear and understand me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmine nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I say &quot;now&quot;, I want you to turn into a man. You&#39;re going to be the man you would have been had you been born male. You&#39;ve always felt that your friendship with Rose was a bit more than just a friendship, and she feels the same way&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;She feels the same way&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Your transformation starts... now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmine stiffened, as though startled. &quot;I feel strange...&quot; she said, holding her hands up to eye level. As she stared at them, they grew bigger, fingers lengthening and thickening as they became stronger. The paint on her nails chipped and fell off as they shrank, becoming short and blunt. Her feet followed quickly, cracking as they enlarged, losing their pedicured elegance as they became large and masculine.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you know what they say about guys with big hands and feet&quot;, said Lesily to Rose, who was watching spellbound.<br />
<br />
Next the growth spread to Yasmine&#39;s arms and legs, making them stretch several inches longer. Yasmine looked awkward and gangly, but soon her torso caught up. To Rose it looked like her friend was being stretched by invisible hands as she inched upwards. From 5&#39;3&#39;&#39; Yasmine stopped growing at a lanky 6&#39;0.<br />
<br />
Growing like that had made a lot of her fat disappear. Now, what was still on Yasmine&#39;s body started to migrate, from her hips, thighs, and bottom to the rest of her, especially to her stomach where she developed a bit of a beer gut. The shift to male fat distribution did not spare her breasts, which deflated rapidly until her chest was almost flat, much better suited for a chubby man than a curvy woman. Her bra hung loosely off her shoulders, and she unclasped it, letting it fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eep!&quot; Yasmine squealed as her body crunched audibly. Her hips caved in, taking away the last of her curves, while her chest and shoulders broadened in return, giving her body an inverted triangle shape. Now her arms and legs and chest started to swell with muscle - at her age, she wouldn&#39;t have been a regular at the gym, but she quickly blew up into a much stockier build, more like a dad who had been a weightlifter. And she went from stocky to practically a bear in proportions.<br />
<br />
A bear? Fine downy black fuzz appeared above her panty line, traveling upwards to her navel, while the same dark fuzz sprouted on her chest and arms. Her leg and armpit hair, originally shaved, returned with a vengeance. The body hair characteristic of her heritage grew and thickened rapidly, and soon her entire body was covered in thick black hair grizzled with grey.<br />
<br />
&quot;My stomach hurts&quot;, said Yasmine, rubbing her belly as her voice cracked like a teenager&#39;s. The hair had traveled up her neck, giving her extensive stubble, and then onto her chin, which squared itself with a crack. The makeup on her face liquefied and ran off, disappearing into her beard, while her long black hair came out of its ponytail and shortened back into her head. &quot;Feels like I&#39;m...&quot; her voice broke again into a high tenor, &quot;turning inside out...&quot; it dropped to a baritone as her hair shortened and thinned.<br />
<br />
Her hands moved down to her crotch. &quot;Ow! Why is this so uncomfortable?&quot; she complained in her new deep voice. Rose could see a bulge forming in the lacy black panties. Annoyed, Yasmine, pushed her panties down and tossed them aside. &quot;Much better&quot;, she said, now standing with her legs apart as her engorged, swelling clitoris, now unhindered, lengthened rapidly out of her thick bush of pubic hair. It was soon followed by her vagina sealing itself and her labia forming a scrotum, into which her ovaries slid and turned into testicles. Her new penis grew until it became eight inches long.<br />
<br />
Yasmine rubbed her head and groaned. &quot;Ugh... what&#39;s happening... why am I here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; said Lesily brightly. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmine looked at Lesily as if seeing her for the first time. &quot;Huh? Oh, it&#39;s Yas&quot;, she said, before noticing that she was naked and putting her hands over her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;And would you refer to yourself as a he or a she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a he&quot;, said Yas. &quot;I mean, you might have noticed? I&#39;m naked?&quot; The audience laughed, and he looked at them and blushed even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, thank you for clarifying that. Are you here on your own?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yas scratched his head with one hand while preserving his modesty with the other. &quot;No, I tagged along with an old friend, Rose&quot;. He sighed as he remembered her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose is right here, and she&#39;s going to need your help!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My help?&quot; He turned to look at Rose, who had been watching breathlessly this whole time. Now that eyes were on her again, she winked and let her hospital gown fall off her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Yas&#39; eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t need me to explain what to do next&quot;, said Lesily.</p>
