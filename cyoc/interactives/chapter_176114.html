<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff walked down and found her rummaging around in the fridge. When she notices him she shuts the doors and turns to him.<br />
<br />
“So how was your day off? Do anything interesting? Or play with any new toys?” she said smirking with a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
Not expecting this to be the first thing his sister’s mouth Jeff stuttered “wh- no, I did nothing like what you were picturing.”<br />
<br />
Her smile fades a bit “did something happen? Is everything fine?” she asked concern showing though.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah everything is fine…down there, just a bit sore from my walk yesterday, it was a bit uncomfortable when I got up.” Jeff said telling the truth to get away from what she was implying.<br />
<br />
“Oh so that is what stopped you. Did you at least try out your other gift?” she said resuming her search through the fridge for an after school snack.<br />
<br />
“No I wasn’t quite ready today.” Jeff lied shrugging it off.<br />
<br />
“O-oh, that’s ok. You can wear them when you feel comfortable; you have already gotten over such a big hurdle take your time let it settle in. D-did you like the styles at least?” she said sounding a little sad by this as she stared in the fridge.<br />
<br />
“Sure, they were…cool. So I saw you took the blue rock that was in my room anything happen with that?”<br />
<br />
“Oh that? I saw it when I dropped off you gifts, I must have put it in my pocket to check out later and forgot about it. why? She said dismissively grabbing something from the fridge and closing the fridge doors again, she turned around crossing her arms in front of her chest why holding a pudding cup in her hand.<br />
<br />
“Ah, so that is what happened. Well no harm no fowl. But if you see it again can you leave it alone. It’s special…to me.” Jeff said as conversationally as he could make it sound.<br />
<br />
“Sure, sorry for taking it, it won’t happen again.” She said as she walked over to the cutlery drawer and grabbed a spoon and walking out.<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn’t sure but he guessed it was cleared up now.<br />
<br />
He went back upstairs walking past her closed door and into his room. He checked and the stone was still by his computer.<br />
<br />
Now that he probably wouldn’t get distracted he checked the blog. Nothing new was added. It seems like it is only rarely updated. The comments he was looking at were 2 weeks old.<br />
<br />
They weren’t new, but they weren’t that old either.<br />
<br />
It was a long shot but it seemed like they were talking abut the magic shop where he was duped. <br />
<br />
He decided it was best to ask a question.<br />
<br />
“Hello I just came across this post. I think I might have visited this store about a week ago. Does anyone know how to find the store? Something went wrong…maybe I could find something to fix what happened?<br />
<br />
He hit submit to comment but got an error noise.<br />
<br />
Highlighted was a log in section stating you need an account in order to post.<br />
<br />
Biting his lip he decided this was his best chance at answers about the store.<br />
<br />
He set up a profile. He stalled on the username, he didn’t want to have anything that could be trace easily back to him. Looking at the other commenters he could guess they did it based on the items they got as sort of an ironic play on words.<br />
<br />
Stone cold swap? No<br />
<br />
Life lord? Meh<br />
<br />
Not wanting to put to much effort in to it he decided to go with, Mismatched life.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t super creative but it didn’t give away to much. It was a nice throw away account if this didn’t turn out well.<br />
<br />
After creating the account and submitting the comment he began looking around at other stories.<br />
<br />
A little later he heard a knock on his door. He quickly turned but the door didn’t open. “Mom called us for dinner.” Emily said sounding slightly muffled through the door.<br />
<br />
“Ok, be down in a few.” <br />
<br />
“Well that was weird; normally she opens the door. I wonder what’s up?” he mumbled out to himself.<br />
<br />
He looked over to the stone and it was just sitting there.<br />
<br />
He shrugged, whatever I will figure it out later; I have enough to worry about myself.<br />
<br />
As he made it down stairs he sat at the table. There was a grocery store lasagna and plates all set out.<br />
<br />
His dad was the one to break the silence.<br />
<br />
“So Jeff, how are you feeling? Does it still hurt?<br />
<br />
“Yeah it’s getting better but…still hurts.” Jeff replied trying to sound convincing. It did still hurt but it was a mild throb, it mainly hurt when he was using the muscles down there.<br />
<br />
“Well, no rush. Take your time for recovery.” His dad said reassuringly.<br />
<br />
“Sure dad, thanks” he said smiling at his dad.<br />
<br />
Soon after his parents started talking about their days and he just quietly ate.<br />
<br />
He noticed his sister finished first and put her dishes away before heading upstairs.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat at the table for a little longer before he excused himself.<br />
<br />
Like his sister he put his dish away before heading upstairs to his room.<br />
<br />
He was feeling bad about how he had left things with his sister; she seemed a bit abrasive after the conversation that afternoon.<br />
<br />
He decided to apologize to her. So he knocked on her door and waited for her to say something.<br />
<br />
“Come in.” he heard her say<br />
<br />
And he entered.<br />
<br />
Look sis, I have been feeling a bit bad about our conversation when you got home and I just- is that my stone?<br />
<br />
Jeff said looking at a familiar stone on her dresser.<br />
<br />
Huh, oh I guess it is, how did that get here?<br />
Did you take it from my room? Jeff accused.<br />
<br />
“Wh- no I don’t know how it got there. Honest.” She replied sounding hurt that he would accuse her of stealing it again.<br />
<br />
 They both reached for it her to give it back to him, him to take it back.<br />
<br />
Not paying attention to what the other was doing they grab for the stone.</p>
