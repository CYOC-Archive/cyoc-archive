<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edward sat in front of the computer in the makeshift office/guest room of his house; taking care of some household bills so as not to be dinged with late fees. He had a sound proof bubble up as he was blasting music while working; preferring an eclectic collection ranging from classic rock to heavy metal. It was music he would listen too with ear buds or headphones; however since becoming an anthro fox fury, neither listening device could fit on his vulpine like ears. In fact all the headgear was geared for human use, not for a fury. Until the technology could be adapted comfortably for fury use, Edward had to keep his choice of music limited to in the car or in a room that he could block out the sound. Not wanting his toddler cub Adam, an anthro cougar cub to hear Pantera, or worse Slipknot; Edward also had to limit some of his music choices to more family friendly varieties.<br />
<br />
“But dam me if I have to listen to ear spitting children’s song that Adam likes all the time,” Edward sighing as he transfers the money for the monthly water, gas and electric bills. Currently, Edward has on his current playlist a random selection ranging from AC/DC, CCR, Led Zeppelin to Quiet Riot, Judas Priest and a song or two from Metallica. Humming to the current song, Metal Militia by Metallica; a fast pace ditty that followed the simpler beat from CCR’s Proud Mary that played earlier. Edward noticed on the task bar an alert to his door bell camera; a feature he installed after a couple of humans shot and killed several furies a few years ago, he noticed that it was his daughter Alison coming over with Jimmy J.R in tow. Edward smiles as he logs out of his banking account, turning off the music while shutting down the computer. Cancelling the sound proof bubble he cast earlier, Edward leaves the room and heads downstairs just as Alison and his Grandcub enter.<br />
<br />
“Grampa,” Jimmy J.R rushing to the fox fury and bear hugging his leg; Edward just chuckles as he lifts the cougar cub up, commenting how heavy the growing weed is getting.<br />
“Where is Adam,” Alison looking around to see a quiet house; glancing in the living room to see the Christmas tree already up, but her mother and young brother nowhere in sight.<br />
“Julian has her paws full with Adam as she is out at the grocery store,” Edward putting down Jimmy and letting him run to the living room to ogle at the tree; “how are you? How is the baby,” Edward smiling as he sees his daughter’s baby bump sticking out proudly.<br />
 “I’m fine,” Alison rubbing her furry belly; “a little tired at times, but that is too be expected with an energetic cub during Christmas and another on the way.”<br />
“It’s a shame your mother and I can’t join the party,” Edward feeling a bit down at not being able to attend the work party at Proudhoof’s; “I hear it’s going to be quiet the randy affair.”<br />
“Employees and immediate mates only,” Alison chuckling; “and yes, I imagine it will be a randy affair. Pity I won’t be able to enjoy most of it as I’m already five months along with this bundle,” the cougar fury watching as her father places an ear close to try and hear the fetus’s heartbeat over Alison’s.<br />
<br />
“Mommy can I watch T.V,” Jimmy J.R. bounding back out of the living room.<br />
“Go ahead,” Alison nodding as she and Edward join him while they wait for Julian and Adam to return from the store.<br />
“Let me,” Edward picking up the remote and selecting the children filter for the channel menu; “have fun and try not to break the remote.”<br />
Alison rolls her eyes as her father heads to kitchen while she sits down next to her son; placing the zip-lock baggie of his toiletries on the coffee table. A bag consisting of his toothbrush with toothpaste and a travel sized bottle of shampoo for a shower later on.<br />
“I’ll stick around until Denise shows up,” Alison noticing her son selecting an old spoof spy show that somehow made it through her father’s filter.  Remembering how this show lampooned the CIA versus KGB during the cold war between America and the Soviet Union in the late sixties, Alison looked at her son as he enjoyed watching the bumbling agent answer a phone call from his shoe or talking to an undercover agent locked in a mailbox that is in heavy use by the public.<br />
“Humans are silly,” Jimmy watching the show; “did you do stuff like this mommy?”<br />
“No Jimmy,” Alison chuckling; “this was a fictional show that was designed to provide an entertaining escape from a scary time that it is poking fun at.”<br />
<br />
“Oh this old chestnut,” Edward returning from the kitchen with a couple glasses of juice for Alison and his grand cub; “this originally aired when my grandparents were your age Jimmy. If you think this is funny, then perhaps we’ll put on an old Marx Brother’s movie after supper.<br />
“Dad,” Alison looking at the anthro fox; “we are trying to steer Junior away from that silly stuff.”<br />
“Which is why,” Edward giving Jimmy a glass of juice; “as a grandparent, I have every right to undercut you and indulge my grandson.”<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes later as the ending credits for the show starts rolling, Julian and Adam arrive home. As soon as the door opens, Adam comes thundering in looking like a snowy mess after running around in the snow again. Edward sighing as he chases his son and manages to wrangle him in and dry him off before he gets his fur soaked from the melting snow. Julian stepping in with several bags of groceries, notices her daughter and grandson sitting in the living room.<br />
“Adam ran that way,” Julian pointing to the basement stairs; “dad is already dealing with him.”<br />
“Then can you get up and help me,” Julian looking at Alison; “grab a few bags so I can close the door.”<br />
“Going to make some mini pizzas for supper,” Julian looking at her grandson; “you can help once all this is put away.”<br />
“Pizza,” Adam shouting as he runs back upstairs and barrels into the living room; seeing Jimmy J.R he continues to shout. “Pizza!  Pizza!”<br />
“But what toppings do you want,” Edward coming up the stairs; “pepperoni, just cheese? Hawaiian,” Edward grimacing at the thought of pineapple on pizza.<br />
“Mushrooms, spicy sausage and ham,” Jimmy J.R responding; perking up at the thought of making his own mini pizza.<br />
<br />
After the groceries were put away, Julian and Alison were chatting in the kitchen while Edward did his best to rein in his son as he ran around and was talking to Jimmy about how excited he was to play in snow. Edward regretted putting the cub down for a nap so early, however he knew Adam would soon wear himself out an hour or two after supper, so he did his best reign the wild cub in as best he could.<br />
“Are you excited for Christmas,” Edward managing to get his grandson’s attention with a board game along with Adam.<br />
“Yes,” Jimmy answering as he throws some dice and moves his playing piece a few spaces; “but I’m mostly excited for the snowball fights. This is more snow then last year,” Jimmy looking outside from the comfort of being inside; seeing at least a good foot of the snow already fallen.<br />
“More is expected on the way,” Edward watching Adam smash his piece on the board as he struggles to count the spaces from his dice throw; “but don’t be surprised if we get a warm spell or rain comes. Enjoy the wintry weather while you can,” Edward smiling as he throws a double five and jumps over Adam’s piece; “soon it will be spring and a rain soak mess.”<br />
“No,” Adam looking sad; “I don’t like rain. It makes angry loud flashes.”<br />
“That is thunder and lighting,” Edward responding; “two items that don’t always join rain unless it is a really intense storm.”<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang during the middle of the board game. With Edward getting up to answer; Adam happily chirps that he won despite Jimmy J.R in the lead. With a potential argument that the Fox fury would soon be brought into, he opens the door to see a familiar tigress fury at the door with her daughter bounding in. He watches as the tigress cub with her belly and chest covered in a creamy brown coat of fur instead of the traditional white with black stripes; Edward notices she had in one paw a bag containing a few hygiene items. And in the other paw, held a unicorn plushie that Edward was all too familiar with. Recognizing the plushie was a character on a Unicorn cartoon that Adam has watched; Edward silently dreaded the prospect of the two cubs singing the theme song. It was one of those repetitive songs he shuddered at having to listen too; but had too as Adam liked it and Julian encourage the cub to sing it.<br />
<br />
“Denise,” Edward smiling as he turned back towards the anthro tigess fury at the door; stepping aside to let the CDC director inside as her cub Roxy was already interrupting the cougar cub’s squabble with her plushie and excitement at seeing the Christmas tree.<br />
“Thank you for this. Roxy is going to be a pawful,” Denise apologizing in advance; “Despite a nap, she has been in overdrive since this morning. Seeing snow and have a blast tobogganing with Michael has made her excited. Seeing the Christmas tree,” Denise sighing as she watches Roxy show off her unicorn; &quot;It has been a mile a minute with her.&quot;<br />
“Adam has been like today as well,” Edward nodding before suddenly looking defeated; hearing both Roxy and Adam starting to sing that Unicorn jingle. “Please shoot me,” Edward mock crying; “why did it have to be that song?”<br />
“Haha,” Denise laughing; “you too? Michael cracked three days after Roxy discovered that show,” Denise watching the two along with Jimmy J.R dance around after finding an episode on t.v. “I got the plushie for her after my last trip,” Denise sighing; as the director for the CDC, the tigress fury had to travel often to the east coast. Most times to Washington D.C; other times to Atlanta Georgia were the CDC headquarters was located. Her last trip had her travel to New York City to speak at the U.N general assembly; it was then Denise picked up the unicorn plushie that Roxy currently treasures and carries with her.<br />
“I have a trick though to block out the song,” Edward taking a pause before subtlety banging his head; “I start mentally listening to Pantera’s song Walk.”<br />
“I’ll let Michael know,” Denise laughing as she calls for Roxy; “you behave you little scamp. Don’t stay up late,” Denise rubbing her daughter’s furry head in affection; “and don’t pig out on candy.”<br />
“Same,” Alison stepping out of the kitchen; “don’t drive your grandpa batty Jimmy.”<br />
“You ready to go,” Denise letting her daughter go with a kiss before turning to the anthro cougar fury; “party has most likely started.”<br />
<br />
&quot;And I bet Michael is already trying to get a round of dueling dicks going,” Alison chuckling as Denise looks on embarrassed.<br />
“Not so loud,” Denise following Alison as she walks outside; Speaking to the pregnant fury as she heads to the waiting car.<br />
Edward closes the door after that awkward comment to sighing in relief as the three were still singing that song; satisfied that they weren’t paying attention to the conversation, Edward starts humming his go to song to drown out the Unicorn’s and Magic madness until supper.</p>
