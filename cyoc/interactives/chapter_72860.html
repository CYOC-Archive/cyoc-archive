<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake saw the slinky black speedo sitting on the shelf. He had never worn a speedo before, he never thought he really had the body for them. He was skinny and pale, most men who could get away with speedos were always tan and muscular. But it couldn't hurt to just try one on in the dressing room. He looked up and down the aisle, almost embarassed as he picked the speedo off the shelf. He tried to hide it in his hands as he made his way towards one of the changing rooms.<br />
<br />
He couldn't have seen the man with the pink tie watching him on the security cameras, nor could he have seen the grin form on the handsome man's face.<br />
<br />
Jake ducked into the fitting room, pulling the door closed behind him. When he turned around his reflection stared back at him. Shaggy brown hair, tall and thin, most would say scrawny.  &quot;Might as well do this.&quot; He muttered to himself as he began to strip.  He pulled of his shirt, revealing a smooth pale torso. Pulling off his pants and underwear didn't reveal much between the legs. It wasn't that he was small, he was just average, but definitely a grower so there wasn't much to see at the moment.<br />
<br />
He sighed and lifted the speedos, stepping into them and sliding them up his legs. He settled them on his hips and looked in the mirror. It hugged him, except in the crotch where the pouch hung a bit loosely. He looked himself over in the mirror. He couldn't help but think he looked like one of those guys on the beach who was oblivious to what they could and couldn't get away with.<br />
<br />
He blinked. The pouch didn't look loose anymore. It hugged an obvious bulge, it looked like someone had shoved a lemon down into the speedo. As he watched the fabric hugged his crotch tighter and tighter, his cock getting larger and larger. Soon the entire form of a large cock could be seen through the tight fabric, the large bulge of his testicles underneath.  He didn't know how it still held him in anymore.  He knew he should be panicking, but all he felt was giddy.<br />
<br />
His balls suddenly dropped down between his legs, no longer held against his body by the speedo. But the dark fabric still covered them. It was soon followed by his cock flopping free, still dark like his balls. He reached down to touch the eight inches of flaccid meat. The dark wasn't the speedo fabric, it felt like skin. Sudden;y that panic settled in.  He went to grab the edge of the speedo but his hands couldn't find it. Just smooth skin with the outline of the speedo marked out. Curly back pubes grew in around the base of his dark shaft, spreading out across his crotch.<br />
<br />
The darkly toned skin began to spread out from where it was, flowing down his legs like water. As his skin darkened it swelled with thick corded muscles. His thighs became toned and fit, and he felt his ass firming up. His calves developed as black flowed down towards his feet. As it slid over the top of his feet they stretched out, becoming longer and wider, his toes thickening. Curly black hair covered his shins and grew up his thighs and down towards his feet.<br />
<br />
The dark skin started growing up his torso, his abdominal muscles popping out in clear definition as they darkened. A trail of dark hair grew from his pubes up between his developing six pack, slowly creeping up towards his chest.<br />
<br />
He was so lost in the spreading transformation he didn't notice the door being pulled open. The face of the store clerk appeared over his shoulder. A hand slid around along his muscular stomach and settled on his cock. &quot;You enjoying yourself, Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake nodded his head lifting his hand to touch his chest as his pectorals swelled out, skin darkening like everything beneath it. Curly dark hair spread out along his chest, hugging tightly against the skin. The clerk's hand began to stroke slowly along Jake's stiffening shaft. Another hand worked around and tweaked one of Jake's hard pert nipples as they turned black. <br />
<br />
The dark skin flowed down his arms with similar results to what happened to his legs. Shoulders and upper arms swelled larger with muscle, veins showing clearly along the tight skin. His forearms followed with more growth right down to his hands. His hands grew to almost twice their previous size. His palms didn't darken as much as the rest of his skin, remained a lighter shade. The clerk's stroking became more eager. His cock was over ten inches and hard as a rock. A stream of pre dribbling from the head and down along his shaft.<br />
<br />
Dark skin grew up his thickening neck and up over his face. His face started to become more and more chiseled and masculine. His chin and jaw heavy and sculpted. Dark stubble formed along his cheeks and jaw. His lips swelled, becoming large and plump and his nostrils flared as his nose broadened. His eyes darkened to a deep chocolate. His hair pulled back into his dark scalp until only a short dark stubble remained. He turned his head and his lips met those of the clerk, who eagerly began to return the kiss.<br />
<br />
Jake moaned deeply as his cock twitched in the clerk's hand. A large thick stream of pale white cream shot out and splattered across the mirror. Quickly followed by several more, the last couple dribbling down the length of the shaft and over the clerk's hand.<br />
<br />
Jake broke the kiss as his orgasm subsided. When he looked in the mirror he was stunned. Staring back at him was a handsome, muscular and very well-hung black man. Of the black speedo there was no sigh. &quot;Does everything in this store do this?&quot; His own voice surprised him, it was a deep rich baritone.<br />
<br />
The clerk grinned slyly as he licked the cum off of his hand.  &quot;One item free, I hope you like it.&quot;  He turned and left the dressing room. Jake looked back in the mirror, maybe another item, just to see what would happen..</p>
