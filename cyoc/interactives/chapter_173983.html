<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While eating the banana, your body is beginning to change without you even noticing. You’re too invested in eating the banana and savoring the flavor. Something continues to push out and grows into a full tail, your spine reforms to fit a more primal look and feel. Your feet cracks and reforms itself into more of a monkey, your big toe slowly pulls away and turns into an opposable thumb while the rest is turned into longer, finger like toes. Finally your flexibility and mobility increases extremely and you grab the banana with your feet and lay back with your hands behind your head without even noticing. Fur grows all over your body and your face reshapes a little to resemble an ape. You finish the banana and the transformation suddenly stops and you finally realize your body looks and feels different. You see your tail and move it around freely, you try to stand up straight but your spine prevents such and makes you have a small hunch, walking feels off as your new monkey feet makes it difficult to do so but you eventually get the hang of it. You then realized that you are being transformed by the hotel. All you can think about is climbing the tree but at the same time you want to get out as soon as possible, hoping to reverse the effects. Immediately you try to sneak away and leave the key at the door then run past the lobby and to your car. You drive away into the night but very tired. You decided to drive into a parking lot of some forest like area or park, you were too tired to drive any further. You get out of your car and examine all the changes that happened to you, it’s all still there. Your posture, tail, face,and feet were still monkey like as well as the fur all over your body. You’re starting to get the idea that it might be permanent. On the bright side you could still look somewhat normal you think to yourself, as long as you hide your feet and tail, as well as never wearing shorts or short sleeves. You get in the back of your car and lay down to rest. You feel yourself getting thirsty and try to grab the water bottle in your cup holder but you grabbed it with your feet. You stop for a moment and realized what you did. You’re grabbing things with your feet like it’s natural, like you’ve been doing it your whole life. The thought suddenly goes away and you use your other foot to open the bottle and stretch your leg up and your foot to your face to drink. It felt so nice to use your new handy feet, you could definitely get used to this. You place the bottle back and laid back down with your feet up, admiring them. You stretched them out and clenched them, making a fist. You then do other types of gestures like pointing, thumps up, closing your feet together, and even stretching them out and popping them just like how you would with your hands. It felt so new but so natural to you as well, you moved them around like you had them your whole life. Maybe this won’t be so bad after all. Eventually you fell asleep but only to wake up suddenly hours later sweating. How was it so hot in the car, you think. You look at the time, it’s about 2:37 in the morning. You best drive somewhere else before some cop comes in and busts you. Before you get up, you get a strong scent suddenly. Ugh what is that smell you think to yourself. Looking at your feet again, remembering you have changed. Monkey feet smell worse than normal when sweaty apparently. Sitting up, you lift your leg up to smell your monkey foot, instead of being disgusted you are surprised you love the smell. Getting your nose all up in your musky monkey foot but suddenly you snap out of it and remember you have to drive away. As you drive along the road, you can’t help but shake the feeling why you were so into your own smelly monkey feet. When you drive past where that hotel was, it was gone. You were just there earlier and now it’s completely gone. You must be going completely insane you think. Continuing to drive down the road you find a nice little motel, it may not be as good as a hotel but it’s the best you got right now, it definitely beats going back to that hotel that was turning you into an animal, not like you it was choice since it’s suddenly disappeared. Before you walk in, you try to hide your tail and any other revealing fur on you. You look around for your shoes but you can’t find them for some reason, you thought you might have forgotten them in the hotel. It’s dark anyways, nobody will notice hopefully. You step out of your car, the ground is so cold beneath your monkey feet. As you walk into the motel, you check in for a room but as you grab the key to your room, you drop it by accident. By instinct again, you grab and pick up the key with your feet. You try to make yourself less suspicious by bending over to grab it from your foot and proceed to find your room. You quickly open your room door and shut it quickly, locking it. You lay onto the bed with relief, finally some quiet and comfortable private time. You thought maybe you should just try to find your way home once you’re done with the motel. It’s only been a day and so much crazy shit happened. How can you live a normal life with all the fur, the tail, posture and your feet like this. You guess it could be worse, it could be harder to hide it all, the only real problem would be your tail. You decided to take your mind off it all and watch some tv. Of course you grab the remote and use it with your feet, but damn it felt good and so natural. Eventually you come upon the news and it talked of some “animal folks” appearing in the area, people who have certain parts of their body replaced by an animal of the respective body part. Some are even fully animal people, none have been fully caught to discuss what’s actually going on but have been seen multiple times but they seem harmless if not even scared of the public. You get worried as those people have definitely experienced what you have back at the hotel, those poor people cursed by the hotel and are forced to live it with. You then change the channel and just try to relax. As the morning sun begins to shine, you keep thinking on what you should do next, you could stay at the motel a little longer, you have enough for at least a week. Back home you live in an apartment alone anyways and you have a work at home job anyways. You then realize how lucky you actually are. It might not be so bad after all. You grow very tired and decided to get some sleep, remove your clothes and just laying on the bed, just airing everything out and stretching out your arms, then your legs and feet, even your tail. A few hours later you wake up in heat. You then realize have a blanket over you with all that fur just makes it too hot. The stench of monkey musk fills your room, you think to yourself you need to shower. You get up to head to the bathroom but as you are about to step in the shower, something stops you. Your mind suddenly changes and you decided to not shower, your monkey instincts is making you think differently. You prefer to be a stinky monkey, it suits the new you. But then the sensation of needing to piss comes in. You walk over to the toilet but again something stops you. Your monkey instincts once more activates, you can’t shake it off but for some reason you want to drink your own piss. With your monkey feet, you grab on to the curtain rack from the shower and hang upside down. You point your dick towards your mouth and release, getting all the piss in your mouth and happily drinking it. When you finished you just hanged upside down for a minute as your mind snaps back and you realized what you’ve done. You drop down and say to yourself I’m definitely not doing that again nor going any further. You can deal with staying a smelly monkey but drinking your own piss is not for you. You head back to your bed and sit down, lifting your monkey foot to get a good sniff at them again. You don’t know why but you just love it, the smell of your own musky monkey feet. You then stop and start to feel hungry, you need to get something to eat. You don’t have much with you at the moment, a couple of granola bars and such but not much of it. You remember seeing a gas station across the street, they must have something good to eat. Unfortunately you feel that you can’t just go in broad daylight, you can easily hide the fur, you’ve gotten better at controlling your tail and keeping it hidden, your monkey face isn’t too bad. The main issue is your feet, your monkey feet in broad daylight will definitely get noticed. Maybe socks? You think, can’t see any weirdness at your feet with socks, but still you feel that it will still be a little risky. Maybe it’s better you wait until it gets darker and guarantee that not so many people will be there. You salvage what food you might have, you have at least two bars and a small bag of chips. It’s not much but it can last until night, it’s only 3:56 pm anyways, won’t take that long. As time goes by, you just watch tv with your arms behind your back. Eating a granola bar with one foot and the remote in the other foot. You’ve been making real use your monkey feet like nobody’s business. Finally the time reaches 8:00 and you just finished your small bag of chips, of course eating them with your handy feet. It’s gotten pretty dark and the gas station seems empty. You put on some sweatpants and a hoodie with your tail curled up against your back. The bagginess of the sweatpants kinda covers your monkey feet so it might be not so noticeable. You step out of your room and lock the door behind you. The cold feeling beneath your feet again and the fresh cold air brushes past you, you get chills and your fur rises up a bit, the feeling of your own fur getting goosebumps is something you never thought you’d feel in your life. It’s more cold then you thought but you can manage, besides you got warm fur and your favorite hoodie to keep you warm enough. The smell of the fresh cold air felt so nice since your room was basically covered in the aroma of your monkey musk, not that you really minded. You then walk across the street and enter the gas station, the cashier there looked tired as hell, he welcomes you as you enter. You give a little greeting and proceed to the back where the drinks are, getting a soda and a fresh water bottle, then grab some chips. The cashier walks to the back room behind the counter, probably to grab something or to use the bathroom real quick, either way, nobody is watching. You walk over the counter and drop the stuff you’re buying but then some candy bars at the bottom caught your eye, you grab a couple with your feet and raised them to the counter. The cashier returns, almost catching you using your feet as you place the bars on the counter before quickly putting your leg back down. He looked quite tired to barely notice what you did but questioned still. In a tired way he says “Did you just have you leg on the counter just now?” You just gave a nervous look and tried to come up with an excuse. “Uhh no why would I do that?” You respond, they just chuckle and brush it off. He then apologizes for the wait for when he went to the back then proceeds to scan. You ask for the chicken they had at there, gotta have some real food too. You give the money and grab your stuff. The cashier in his tired state notes your face looks odd. He says not to be rude but it’s almost ape like. You just respond with a simple “I get that a lot, I take it as a compliment.” He then mentions you smell odd too. You just give a simple thanks with a smile. You both chuckle and waves you goodbye. Right before you touch the door to leave he also notices your barefooted and questions again. “Why aren’t you wearing shoes? You’re not like homeless are you?” Once again he says in such a tired way. You decided to mess with the poor tired fella and place down your stuff. “No actually it’s because I have no use for shoes.” You say as you proceed to pick up your foot and present them to the tired cashier, wiggling your toe fingers. The cashier looks in awe as he gazes on your handy feet. “Woah bro, are those real? Are you like some kind of monkey dude?” They say in response as they continue to gaze at your monkey foot. “They definitely are, here let me show you.” You say as you walk up closely to the counter and raise your foot again. The cashier gets a closer look, you encourage him in touching it. He proceeds to do so and basically massages it. “That’s so cool dude, wish I was born with these.” He says, almost assuming you were just born like this. You then feel like you need to hurry and head back so you tell him you should hurry on and leave. You give the cashier a handshake with your monkey foot and then grab your stuff. You both say goodbye and you leave, it actually felt good to do that especially when it won’t matter when the guy is so tired he’ll barely remember it and most likely will think it’s a dream. You rush back to your room and quickly close the door before anyone would notice you. You lay on your bed and start eating your food. As annoying it was needing to wait until dark just to get some damn food, it could still be worse. You wondered if you might also meet the other folks who were transformed by the hotel and escaped. Another question popped in your head, what happens to the people who stayed even after their transformation? Do they enjoy staying? Question after question keeps popping up in your head the more you think about it all. There’s totally some organization underground made up of the people who were cursed by the hotel. You chuckle at the idea and how ridiculous that sounds but then realized that could actually be a thing, it sounds quite plausible. A few days passed, not doing much but hanging around your room, doing different tricks with your new flexibility and dexterity. Played around with a few things with your monkey feet, grabbing things with your tail. All you’ve pretty much done was practice your ability of being a literal monkey man. You’ve also been doing the same routine of waiting until dark to grab any food you need from that gas station, greeting the same tired dude each time and actually making a bond with the guy. You’ve been getting better at disguising yourself as a normal human being. You tried the idea of using your socks to hide your handy feet, been working pretty well, as long as you keep your feet in a certain way where it doesn’t look unnatural. The time has come though to get moving back to your home, especially when you got a long ways to go. You begin gathering all your things, ready to finally leave the motel. You step out, the sun setting with that cold breeze and the smell of incoming rain, it kinda relaxes you for a moment. You walk to the reception to check out and then head straight into your car, shoving your things in quickly. You gas up your car at the same gas station before driving away. After hours of driving, you pass through a small town with a rather large forest that’s a popular spot for camping. Since it’s very late and you’re very tired you decided to set your car deep in the forest, away from any folks currently camping there and sleep in your car. You park your car the farthest away from folks camping but there were quite a few so some are more near than you’d like but it’s still pretty far so good enough. You then walk out of your car and stretch out. The feeling of stretching out your monkey feet and tail is still a new experience but felt so natural. You wiggle your tail a bit from it being stiff most of the time from sitting at your car. You take a good look at your surroundings and find that you parked in a decent spot, you got a fire pit and a picnic table. It’s pretty dark but you set out on making a fire. Didn’t take long to get a good one going, you had the right tools with you. You sit at the fire for a moment and finally relax completely, you need this time to feel free. This is actually really nice you think, just as long as nobody comes over to you, there are quite a lot of people camping this time of year apparently. You grow extremely tired and decided to get in the backseat of your car, grab a pillow, pull up a blanket, and finally lay your head to rest. You wake up, you check the time on your phone, it’s 6:35 am. Sun is barely rising, you get up and rub your eyes. You sniff the air, the strong aroma of your own monkey musk is much stronger than it was in your motel room since its in a smaller area. You get a good whiff of your monkey musk, loving how much stronger the scent. You sit up and grab a water bottle, opening it as you scratch your head with your monkey feet, your leg stretched up to your head. You take a sip of water and put it away then stepped out of your car. Not many other campers are up yet so you take this a good time to walk about and stretch out. You find a rather large tree next to that picnic table, you kinda want to put your monkey skills to the test and climb it. Ah what the hell, wouldn’t hurt to try you thought. You hop on top the picnic table and then crouch down like a monkey would. You then spring upwards, grabbing a branch, then jump towards another, climbing up branch by branch, including your tail and monkey feet. After reaching a certain point you firmly grab a branch and crouch again like a monkey usually does. It felt so good to climb a tree like a monkey, especially with your tail, monkey feet, and your flexibility/dexterity. Suddenly you feel the need to piss but you’re already up so high. Before you even think about climbing down to piss, you suddenly just start pissing as you are crouching on the tree. Without even thinking your body just releases, as if it doesn’t even matter where you go to piss. As if your body is basically going autopilot. As soon as you finish you start climbing down  and head back to your car. You put back on your boxers from when you removed last night to sleep. They smell awfully musky but that just motivates you to continue wearing it only to make it even more smelly like the stinky little monkey you enjoy being. You then get a sniff at your musky socks from when you had to disguise your monkey feet. They smelled so amazing to you, you simply couldn’t resist. With a stinky sock in your hands, you completely cover your nose, shrouding your scent in nothing but the smell of combination of stinky socks and your musky monkey feet. Your cock grows hard, with both your hands busy you reach your monkey foot to your underpants and lower enough to reveal your cock. You begin rubbing your cock with your monkey foot and then start stroking. Didn’t take long before you release, quite a big load too. You got it all over your monkey foot, you stretch your leg up, your monkey foot to your face and lick off the cum. After you finish you lay there and rest. You thought this place in the forest was a nice place to stay for a bit but you could use some more supplies if you are. The best decision was to drive out and find the nearest store and come right back to this spot as soon as possible. You get in the driver seat and head out. A couple hours later, old routine to stay undetected, you finally start coming up to your spot expect from a far distance you notice there’s a small group of folks that have set up camp there with a huge tent and such. Who else would set up camp so far from the others like this. Oh well you thought and maybe find another place that’s similar to that old spot. Something caught your eye as you slowly approach them, they seemed odd. One of them that was out setting up a campfire, hoodie up and most his body covered except something slipped out behind him, it was his.. Tail? He had a tail of a dog? You stop your car in it’s tracks and examine further, another one walks out of the tent to what seems to be helping the other one set up the fire. Same type of clothing too but then the second person took off their hood. He looked like a cat. You slowly drive further down there, the cat quickly put up their hood before you approached closer. They look away as you drive pass. You then go towards another camping area that was similar the one they took. Without a doubt you knew those people have also been to the same hotel that you escaped, probably suffering the same way you are. Having to basically go in hiding from what the hotel has done to them. Alone again, you let out a sigh, you are wondering in your head if you should interact with those folks that are just like you. Or just continue on alone a little more.</p>
