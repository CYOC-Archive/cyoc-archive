<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tylers skill orally was something to truly fantasize about. Tyler&#39;d advanced in his oral assistance and now his lips were wrapped around the thick head of the cock presented before him, his tongue slipping back and forth under that thick foreskin. Charlie couldn&#39;t help but enjoy it. The more time he had to let the thoughts of the hardware he&#39;d pilfered from his neighbors sink in, the more he remembered and realized everything he&#39;d set in place. This young man who was all about the throngs of young women he witnessed him bring home on the weekends when his parents were away? He was now on his knees blowing a thick cock he couldn&#39;t have even imagined having when he left home that morning. In his new state..he thought so much clearer and it was obvious that he had the real power now and that meant only one thing; He was going to take full advantage of it. While Tyler continued blowing him, Charlie finally managed to speak softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You..home alone?......Where&#39;s the...where&#39;s your parents?...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler paused his oral fixation along what few inches of charlies cock he could fit almost down his throat and looked up at him with a certain sparkle in his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea....they&#39;re still in Colorado....I just got home from camp early...they don&#39;t even know i&#39;m back yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
That information wasn&#39;t so much Tyler bragging as it was charlie gathering information about the young man he had as a student. If only he knew that he was blowing his former biology teacher. What would he have said? Would he have been able to say anything? He supposed it didn&#39;t really matter considering the boy was on his knees now and THAT was all that mattered. Slowly, he raised a hand and let it run through the kids blonde locks and back over his head until he was gripping the back of his neck strongly and slowly beginning to rut his hips forward into the young mans throat. The possessiveness his personality had naturally began to take over and it made him wonder. While Tyler enjoyed being throat fucked, if only for a brief moment, Charlie was deep in thought again, and his attention was on the laptop and the chronivac there on the desk. He swallowed hard then and after a few more pumps into the teens mouth, he pulled back just enough so his cock fell free from the suction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool...hey uh...commere....I wanna try something...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler nodded up at him and carefully got back to his feet so he could be led into the office space where he&#39;d just been &quot;Working&quot;. Charlie positioned the chair in front of his desk in such a way so Tyler could have a seat there facing the rest of the room and charlie could move back around to the other side of the desk where he&#39;d been sitting before and examine the screen of the laptop again. His own stats were still there but he had some alterations to make. Those deep pools of brown cut upward to the teen now eyeballing him suspiciously but with the same devilish grin on his face as before and Charlie winked and caused Ty to blush. It seemed like everything he did had a reactive effect on the kid and that was fine by him. That he wouldn&#39;t change. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...Just look at the TV. It&#39;s gonna be a surprise.....you go to school around here?..&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it. build rapport. Lull him into an even further sense of comfort by asking him about himself. Tyler nodded of course and went to talking about how he was a senior in High School with a full ride to three universities already. As if charlie didn&#39;t already know this. If it wasn&#39;t from his parents bragging, it was from the consistent announcements at school about the top contenders in the senior class. Either way, it kept Tyler talking while Charlie worked on the computer. Since the changes on his end weren&#39;t many, he did himself first. Once he clicked the initiate button once more? The sphere blinked twice and once again he had the warm sensation rushing over his body while the timer on the screen counted down again. This time it was only 30 seconds, but the changes were apparent. Rather than stay 18, he moved his age back upward to about the age he was before; 35. That gave him a ruggedness that he only acquired once he hit his 30&#39;s, and the salt and pepper tone returned to his hair. his musculature remained the same though, Strong and well toned all over to the point that he was literally only moments from busting out of the shirt he still had on, hulk style. The heavy cock Tyler just been so eager to gobble down hung heavily down between his open thighs still and as far as unseen traits went, he found himself proud of what he&#39;d managed to think of in such a short period of time. Once his changes were complete, he then clicked to save his own personal changes then initiated a second profile in which he put in Tylers stats. Granted, he didn&#39;t know them specifically so of course he had to wing it from what he saw and guessed. Physically, he didn&#39;t change anything...but personality wise..he tinkered with what he could see and quietly turned the sphere so it was aimed at Tyler. With a click, it blinked twice again and the 10 second count down rolled off then flashed across the screen as complete. Tyler glanced back over at him and suddenly stood up in shock when he saw the younger man was replaced my an older well built version who was now standing behind the desk staring him down. His mouth opened and he got ready to speak his alarm when Charlie suddenly spoke first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk. &quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie fell silent then and just watched as Tyler, who&#39;d been so ready to question what had just happened, fell silent and surprised all at once. Charlie grinned widely then and nodded his head in approval then slowly took a few steps around the side of the desk and stopped there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit back down and stay there until I tell you to move..&quot;<br />
<br />
Down Tyler went, back into the seat, confused. He wanted to question what was happening but he didn&#39;t. And now he was seated with the man he&#39;d just been blowing now watching him intently with an ever growing grin on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...this has got to be the best day ever.....I found a new toy...and a new body...I mean check me out...I&#39;ve come a long way from the Biology teacher you&#39;ve gotten use to huh?.....I went from 38 to 18 and back to 35 all in the course of an hour....So now I think I want to play with this thing even more...Starting with my neighbor..&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie took a seat along the edge of the desk and pulled the sphere over so it was aimed at Tyler then he turned the laptop around so he could see the screen again. Every so often he&#39;d cut his eyes back toward the well toned athlete with the swimmers built then he&#39;d look back to the screen and make a few more changes. The more he altered, the more excited he got until finally he took a slow inhale and finally made eye contact with Ty again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go kid...you&#39;re about to become the ultimate fuckboy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylers eyes got big and once charlie clicked, he blinked at the bright flashes and soon he himself felt the warm tingling sensation all over his body. The swimmers build he&#39;d acquired during the summer changed slightly to something more slender, and smalled all over with an even more robust version of the bubble butt he already had. Rather than the desire to dominate and take over, he now had a completely submissive desire toward Charlie and the moment the timer counted all the way down to zero? He was completely subservient to charlie in such a way that whatever the muscle daddy now seated before him said do? He would do. Once the clock counted down though, Charlie looked back over at him and canted his head, ready to try it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get up and strip..all the way naked..&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler stood up then and without a moment of hesitation, he removed his track jacket first, followed by the much looser fitting tank top to reveal his much smoother upper body. Next went the track pants, but only after he kicked off his sneakers so he could undo the laces at the front of his pants and let them drop to the floor. Once he pulled his socks off, the last thing he removed was his jock strap which soon revealed just what else he&#39;d changed about the kid. He didn&#39;t know his exact measurements, but judging from his reaction to seeing himself naked, he could tell that the 4 inch cock he now had was a significant change from what he started out with. While Tylers shock said it all in his eyes, Charlie nodded in approval and pushed up from the desk so he was standing over the teen again. Now he was much more intimidating compared to the 18 year old who tyler&#39;d originally seen out in the hallway. Slowly, he ran his palm down the rough cut of his abs and slid the chair Ty&#39;d been seated in back so he could walk around him once and fully examine his new conquest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good......Since your parents won&#39;t be home for another two weeks..guess where you&#39;re staying kid...I&#39;m gonna fuck you inside out...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was even more obvious now that his own confidence levels were much higher, as were his overall testosterone levels. He was the ultimate top now, and how he prowled around Tyler, examining every part of his body screamed just how much he was going to ravage the kid. It was only in dreams that he&#39;d ever imagined such luck and opportunity and now he had it all right in front of him. The chronivac was incredible, and that prompted his turning his back to tyler so he could flip the laptop closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t touch this computer...or anything in this room...you don&#39;t even come in here....Now...go upstairs to my bedroom..and wait for me on the bed..&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler turned obediently and headed back out the archway and rounded the corner so he could head up the stairs. Just then, the phone rang prompting charlie to turn his attention from the departing ass he was about to destroy, to the flashing of the phone positioned on the corner of the <b>desktop...</b></p>
