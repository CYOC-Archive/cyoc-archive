<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Sammy and Jessy had gone about learning about why baby furs had come about and gained the abilities to confront the &quot;bad things&quot; that might try to find their way into the world, Teddy and his new friends Jamie the Rabbit and Marion (called Mari) the Deer were making their way through desert outside the military base where Teddy had originally been taken to. Teddy was still focused on his sister and her baby. He knew that he was going to be an Un-cal and wanted to be there to tell the baby that the baby would be well loved, to assure his sister that he wouldn&#39;t deliberately transform her unless she wanted to join him as a baby fur. He wondered a bit on how Jamie and Mari became baby furs, but they let him out of the cell that the army or the scientist people put him in, and he managed to upload his video and email it back to his friends Oscar and Doctor Sammy. <br />
<br />
From there they simply walked out of the base as though there was no problem with it. And there wasn&#39;t really, as Mari was in charge and Jamie was supposed to guard him and her. So, he wasn&#39;t disobeying what the &quot;not-friends&quot; said, and from what they had said to him, they wanted to help him, so it wasn&#39;t like they were bad people. Maybe a bit confused, but not bad. So, Teddy was more than glad to welcome their company as they had toddled out of the building. No one bothered them as they left or even noticed that they left, not that Teddy complained. His goal was to get to his sister and be a good Un-cal. <br />
<br />
Mari lead them to what had been her car, and as soon as she touched the door handle it shrank down to be of a more appropriate size for baby furs. The vehicle, originally a dark forest green, became a a bright green with the main part of the car rising up to sit taller, like a toy car. The car&#39;s engine compartment seemed to vanish, making the vehicle look rather blunt noised. It did remain long enough so that it had a back seat. The three of them began to climb into the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where does your sister live?&quot; Mari asked as they looked both ways across a street on the base outside the medical detention center where Teddy had been held.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we used to live in Knocks Ville,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;but she got scared that being a baby fur would make her mindless or that her baby wouldn&#39;t see her as a mom...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No friend would hurt someone,&quot; Jamie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you still think... I think,&quot; Mari added.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was still scared,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;and wanted to move to Fee-necks where there weren&#39;t baby furs. I told her she didn&#39;t need to fear... but she was still scared. So I promised to let her go and return to Knocks Ville if she promised to let me be there when the baby in her tummy came out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s where the other soldiers caught you,&quot; Jamie said slowly as Mari began to drive the car, pretending to make car noises as they rode along, &quot;and then brought you back to the base.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy nodded and they began to ride out of that parking lot area. Mari drove quietly out of the parking area and was quick to drive along the roads on the base. No one bothered them as they drove along, and it actually appeared that it was rather dark outside. Teddy didn&#39;t care about that, so long as he got to see his sister and show her he could be a good un-cal.<br />
<br />
&quot;But since things are okay, I wanna go see my sister,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;let her know that I love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two baby furs nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the base is here in Cee-air-uh Vi-est-tah,&quot; Mari commented, &quot;and Fee-necks is that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy watched from beside Mari as she pointed. Her arm pointed out into the desert to the northwest of where they were. He was thankful for Mari and Jamie becoming friends, regardless of some of the oddness to it. He nodded as Mari drove along. She followed the streets that made up the base and soon came across an exit gate. The gate was open with a lone man on guard. Mari pulled up to it and stopped at the gate as the soldier raised a hand. The man seemed to squint, as if looking into bright lights, even though the car didn&#39;t have actual lights. They were just light shaped stickers where the lights would be on a car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; the soldier said slowly as Mari pulled up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; Mari said in a semi-excited voice, but also one that could be shown as though she was an important worker at the base, which Mari technically was, &quot;Mari the Deer. I&#39;m just taking some friends out to Fee-necks. We&#39;ll be back later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, shouldn&#39;t you be kept safe so you can be turned back?&quot; the soldier asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be no fun,&quot; Mari said with an innocent giggle, &quot;we should all be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
The soldier paused, shrugged and gave a chuckle. As he chuckled, he began to shrink down, his clothing melting away and as brown fur began to cover his body, though his belly fur was white. Teddy watched with some cheer as the soldier guarding the base continued to transform. His rifle reshaped into to a water gun, much like Jamie&#39;s. His body got younger as he shrank down as well. He had no wrinkles to lose, but the angles and shape of his face that indicated maturity seemed to round out as became younger. His muscle seemed to lose its bulk and definition. By the end, he looked as though he was two or three years old, at the oldest. Whiskers sprouted from the sides of his face as it began to push forward into a rounded feline muzzle and his rounded ears rose onto the top of his head. His hat vanished with the rest of his clothing, though his pants and underwear shrank and then shifted into a camouflage colored synthetic diaper that had an opening the back for brown furred tail with a black tip. A private first class insignia stood out in bright gold on the front of the new mountain lion baby fur&#39;s diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; the mountain lion baby fur nodded and then chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Jamie wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a cougar,&quot; the mountain lion baby fur chuckled, &quot;even though I&#39;m a male and a baby fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
How the baby fur knew or understood the slang reference to a older woman, usually middle aged and much older than her partner, who was sexually interested in younger men was a bit of a mystery, but then Mari, Teddy, and Jamie all figured that soldiers all knew the odd things like that, or maybe they didn&#39;t know. As when asked what a &quot;cougar&quot; was, the mountain lion baby fur answered that it was another name for a mountain lion or puma. Maybe his chuckling was at all the names for the animal. He then waved Mari on, and let them leave the base. Unknown to them, they were already behind many of the signs were being tried to contain the baby furs to where they were and soon the base would become baby furs, as while there were some of the specialized spacesuits on the base, they weren&#39;t the standard uniform and were kept in specialized storage lockers and all of the troops stationed at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Arizona, by a twist of fate, didn&#39;t live on the base.<br />
<br />
While Mari drove on, Teddy and Jamie waved to the mountain lion baby fur as they departed and were soon on the road to Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
