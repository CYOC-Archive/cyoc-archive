<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in America, Selena stirred from a doze. She&#39;d been napping in human form for a while, but now she had to recharge the Ring of Embraces. Tiring day or not, she had to get her equipment ready to transform Samantha Lamb, Marley Roberts, Amber Mitchell-Erickson, and Brittany Mitchell-Erickson. And who knows? Ashlee Kline might dig up some more humans eager for a walk on the wild side at the cheer tryouts. Either way, there were going to be new recruits for the pack tomorrow eager to get their werehyena forms.<br />
<br />
Selena slid the magical golden bowl out from its hiding place beneath her winter coats and filled it with water. She then took out the salt shaker that she&#39;d borrowed from the kitchen and shook a generous portion of salt into the water. She stirred the solution in generously. Now there was only one ingredient left to add.<br />
<br />
Selena stood up straight and willed her shift to begin. Her red body hair began to thicken into fur as it spread over her entire body. Selena sighed contentedly as she felt her muscles bulk up and her spine lengthening. Her feet stretched out into hyena paws while her hair spread down her back as a luxuriant mane. Her lower back tingled deliciously as her tail pushed out. That feeling never got old. As Selena&#39;s nails sharpened into the claws of a mighty hunter, she felt a lovely warm feeling under her tits as a smaller pair budded. The alpha cackled with delight as her face began to change, her mouth pushing out into a hyena snout filled with sharp teeth. To complete the look of her head, Selena&#39;s ears grew big and round before climbing to the top of her head.<br />
<br />
Selena looked down to her pussy, eager to witness the most important change. She watched with gleeful anticipation as her clit swelled and lengthened. Once it reached her knees, the clit began to reshape itself into a true cock. Selena felt hir pussy moving backwards to make room for hir balls. Shi grinned as shi saw the smooth flesh unter hir cock expand into a baggy sack of skin. Shi then yelped with pleasure as shi felt hir balls drop into hir nutsack. Now shi was ready to jerk off.<br />
<br />
Selena crouched down and fiddled with hir cock to get it hard. Once shi had hir wood going, shi aimed hir throbbing cock at the golden ball and began to rhythmically stroke its shaft. As shi jerked off, Selena thought about Tatiana. Shi wondered how big the cock Tatiana was growing would be. What would the foreskin look like? There definitely <i>would</i> be a foreskin, of course. Tatiana always believed in keeping the body natural. That was something her clanmate Liesel had taught her. Besides, a good foreskin kept the dickhead nice and sensitive, and it gave you more skin to play with. But would Tats want a long foreskin or a short one? A loose and baggy one or a tight and snug one? And what about her new nuts? Would her balls be nice and plump? Would her sack be smooth or hairy? The questions were making Selena even hornier.<br />
<br />
And then there was the prospect of tanuki semen potion making Selena virile enough to knock up a vampire. Shi could potentially put a cub in Tats. Shi sighed in bliss as shi pictured hir vampire mate&#39;s belly swollen with hir cub. Until then, there was hir other mate Jenna McSweeney to impregnate. Selena moaned as shi fantasized about a future where shi could fill Jenna up with cub after cub, picturing hirself lovingly stroking hir mate&#39;s rounded belly. Of course, that would have to wait until the werehyenas were off on their own, away from their human (or werewolf) families...<br />
<br />
Selena suddenly felt hirself go over the edge. Shi shrieked with pleasure as hir orgasm hit hir. Hir cock twitched as it shot a few ropes of werehyena cum into the salt water solution. Once hir climax wore off, Selena glanced down at the fruits of hir masturbation. Hir load was surprisingly small. Shi usually shot out three or four times as much jizz when she jacked hirself off. Selena realized that shi&#39;d probably overmilked hir dick at Chloe&#39;s birthday orgy. Shi&#39;d need to be careful to ration hir spunk for more important uses in the future. It was a good thing Tatiana was busy with the new clanmate&#39;s initiation ceremony. It would be so embarrassing for Selena to fuck hir mare and come up completely dry. It&#39;d be worse than a premature ejaculation!<br />
<br />
Selena stirred hir smallish cum harvest into the salty water. It wasn&#39;t hir usual massive load, but shi was pretty sure that didn&#39;t really matter apart from stinging hir pride as a werehyena alpha. Morgana Faye had never said the solution needed a specific amount of werehyena spooge to fully recharge the Ring of Embraces. It should still change eight girls into werehyenas just fine. Selena picked up the golden bowl and placed it on her windowsill to let it soak up the moonlight overnight.<br />
<br />
Hir job done, Selena willed hirself to shift back into hir human form. The werehyena alpha sighed as she shrank back down into a skinny five foot eight human girl with no cock. She glumly cupped her crotch, missing the feel of hir girthy dick under her fingers. But she needed to stay in her human form as much as possible on the werewolf homestead to avoid a massive fight with her mother. Hell, even her dad might not understand. At least her sisters had her back, but there was only so much they could do when they weren&#39;t pack specialists yet. Until then, Selena needed to be stealthy. To that end, she picked up the spray-on potion Morgana had given her to mask her hyena scent and sprayed some behind her ears. She wasn&#39;t sure if the last application had worn off yet, but better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
Selena slid into her bed. She didn&#39;t bother with pajamas. Wolfborn or not, her werewolf family had raised her in werewolf culture and expected her to sleep naked. Selena was glad she didn&#39;t have to fuss with clothes outside of school. She&#39;d always found them dreadfully uncomfortable. She wondered if that was because of her upbringing, because of her werebeast heritage, or did humans secretly feel this way as well?<br />
<br />
As she fluffed her pillow, Selena wondered what the y&#333;kai exchange students would get up to at Stokerville High School tomorrow. Since her packmates Ellie, Beck, Harper, and Brianna were why the student exchange had been set up, Selena felt like the y&#333;kai were her responsibility. Some of them like Humiya, Tamiko, H&#333;k&#333;, and Yuna seemed like they&#39;d be easy to keep out of trouble, but Asuga and Maiko were a different story entirely. Asuga was a walking tanuki stereotype: sex-crazed, freewheeling, mischievous, and tricky. They weren&#39;t all like that, but Asuga certainly seemed to be.<br />
<br />
And Maiko was a yako: a kitsune who lived outside of Inari&#39;s holy laws. Also known as nogitsune, they had a special talent for terrorizing the humans of Japan. It was said that werefoxes were the descendants of yako who migrated west across Eurasia, and that didn&#39;t paint an encouraging picture. But Maiko didn&#39;t seem <i>evil</i>, exactly. Just impulsive and full of hirself. Selena resolved to keep an eye on the kitsune diva and ask Morgana for help if shi couldn&#39;t be kept in check.<br />
<br />
Selena briefly wondered if Asuga and Maiko risked running afoul of the various monster hunters hanging around town these days. Wilhelmina &quot;Will&quot; Weiss and Victoria &quot;Tori&quot; Vordenburg were both very stubborn girls who could create a lot of chaos in the magical community if they decided someone wasn&#39;t &quot;minding their manners.&quot; But Selena had reason to suspect that Tori and her girlfriend Erzulie would be heading off to Japan to investigate Beck&#39;s stay in the sumo heya soon. That raised questions about who would tutor H&#333;k&#333; if Erzulie was leaving with Tori, but Selena couldn&#39;t picture Tori passing up on a lead. On the other claw, Kibibi had thought shi&#39;d smelled other people in Tori&#39;s car when she&#39;d barged into Chloe&#39;s orgy. Did the Vordenburg girl have a full team? Would she send some agents to Japan while she stayed in Stokerville? Selena couldn&#39;t be sure, but it was something to think about.<br />
<br />
Either way, Will Weiss was definitely not going anywhere, not with her sister settling into life as a von Karnstein. Fortunately, that little family connection gave Matriarch Carmilla at least <i>a little</i> influence with Will. How ironic that a monster hunter descended from Jonathan Harker, bane of Dracula, had a vampire for a sister. Amusing or not, it could prove to be the protection Asuga and Maiko needed. (Or Selena&#39;s pack, for that matter.) With that thought in her head, Selena nodded off to sleep.</p>
