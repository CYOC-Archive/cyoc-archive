<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After waiting for some time, admiring her new titanic tits and getting filled with pride by the surrounding stares, it was Samantha’s appointment with the doctor.<br />
<br />
After her mother told her good luck, Samantha stood up from the bench, and felt an enormous weight forwards as her heavy chest weighed her down.<br />
<br />
But somehow, she managed to stand up straight, with the weight of her chest, as heavy as it is, not feeling cumbersome.<br />
<br />
Samantha guessed that due to her wish to not have health problems due to her body, that she was able to walk straight without her giant breasts bending her body forwards and causing back problems.<br />
<br />
After covering the distance to the doctor’s office door in a handful of strides, she switched to a a crawling position to crawl through.<br />
As huge as the giant preteen’s breasts were, they still had a far way before they would have caused a problem to crawl or to go through a normal sized doorframe.<br />
Still, they got a bit in the way of the arms while crawling, though not enough to make it a problem.<br />
<br />
Crawling through a normal doorframe due to being 10 feet tall and having breasts that got a bit in the way while doing such crawling would have been seen as horrible for most people. But still, due to the wish Samantha made two days prior when she was still 5’10 and with E cups to enjoy her height and curves, the adult turned titanic 12 year old loved feeling so huge.<br />
<br />
While crawling inside, Samantha saw her doctor, who greeted her. “Hello there Samantha”<br />
The doctor appeared to be a young adult man, a bit about six feet in height.<br />
“Hey there doctor Jones” she replied as she stood up, her fabricated memories telling her his name.<br />
Standing up, Samantha once again admired just how tall she is next to other people.<br />
<br />
The doctor then continued and took the girl’s measurements, as he normally does.<br />
First was her height. After removing her flip flops, Samantha stood against the wall.<br />
Due to being too tall for normal measuring devices, the doctor marked the girl’s height (standing on a step ladder while doing so) and used it to measure the distance between it and the ground, repeating the measurement thrice to be precise.<br />
Just to be sure, Samantha silently wished that the doctor will measure her accurately.<br />
“This is insane…” the doctor said. “Looks like you stand a tiny bit above ten feet tall”<br />
Samantha’s wish to know her height confirmed that statement. She grew a fraction of an inch from the 10’ she was yesterday, overnight!<br />
<br />
Then they measure her weight. The result was 400 pounds. For most people, it would have been extremely overweight, but on a 10 foot stature, it was extremely low. Especially when the breasts alone would have weighed over 12 pounds combined.<br />
<br />
Then it was time to get additional measurements.<br />
Samantha removed her clothes, and watched as even the doctor, who was meant to be a professional who was used to seeing her, looked at her body in awe.<br />
<br />
The waist size was 32 inches.<br />
The band size was, as she knew from her wish, 38 inches.<br />
As the doctor put the tape measure over her bare breasts, the statuesque girl felt a bit of pleasure from the act.<br />
The bust size was 52 inches.<br />
<br />
Then, after Samantha put back her clothes, doctor Jones measured her heartbeat, and then took a blood sample.<br />
After that, and looking at the results, he called her mother in and explained the results to the mother and child.<br />
<br />
“First, let’s talk about your height” doctor Jones said. “We already know your growth is insane, but you grew over four inches since the last time I saw you, and that was a bit over two weeks ago! A human shouldn’t be capable of growing so fast, especially for such a long timeframe. Growing from four feet tall to over ten feet in a bit over a year shouldn’t be possible, and cause countless problems, yet you are extremely healthy.”<br />
“We can most likely call it gigantism, but at the same time, you lack any symptoms for most of the classic variants of the disease. It appears as if it’s just a part of your puberty.”<br />
<br />
Samantha then realized just how insane her growth was in this reality. She used to be at a normal height, if not on the shorter sides for an 11 year old, until a little over a year ago, and then grew so fast she broke world records. This was insane, and she loved it.<br />
<br />
The doctor then continued.<br />
“Now, your weight is 400 pounds. This would have been extremely overweight for a normal girl, but for you, it’s alarmingly low. You weigh 40 pounds less than the former world record for tallest person ever did, yet you’re over a foot taller.<br />
This is due to your body being a lot more proportionally skinny than if you just scaled up a normal sized person, and most of your height coming from your legs.<br />
The waist size is 32 inches and the underbust is 38.<br />
It comes to a point that if you were downscaled to 5 feet tall, you would have had measurements far too small for any clothes in a shop to fit you both in length and width.<br />
<br />
“And that brings us to your breasts…”<br />
“Due to the breast tissue being over 3% of your body mass, you have macromastia. More specifically juvenile macromastia, as it appears to be due to your puberty.”<br />
“Unlike most cases though, your breasts appear to be healthy. No stretch marks, nearly identical sizes. It is extremely strange.”<br />
<br />
“Your blood pressure appears to be healthy, despite the need for your heart to pump so much blood over such varying heights.”<br />
<br />
“To summarize things, Samantha, you are an extremely extraordinary case. A bit over a year ago, you were fairly small and underdeveloped for your age, and now you are the tallest person to ever exist with an extremely developed body.”<br />
“Even more extreme is how despite such a fast growth to inhuman proportions, it appears to function more like normal puberty on overdrive than anything.”<br />
“And the extraordinary miracle is how you appear to be completely healthy. It would have been assumed that you would have quickly died with such a body, yet you are healthy.”<br />
<br />
“So I don’t have to worry about the health of my daughter?” Jennifer asked<br />
“As I said, your daughter appears to be completely healthy, despite all consequences” doctor Jones said. “At least for now”<br />
<br />
“You said my growth was due to puberty. Does that mean I’m still growing?” Samantha asked, hoping that the answer is yes.<br />
“I cannot confirm it, but I theorize that you have a long way to go before you stopped growing.” The doctor said worryingly.<br />
<br />
Samantha was filled with joy inside while her mother was shocked, with fear in her eyes for what her daughter will become.<br />
<br />
After the doctor explained to Jennifer about what she should prepare for, how her daughter was likely to break more than just human records and how the blood sample he got will possibly answer questions until the next checkup, he told the greeted Samantha and Jennifer goodbye, and the mother and her giant daughter left.<br />
<br />
As Samantha returned to her car, admiring all of the movements of her titanic chest, she was filled with excitement.<br />
She was already the tallest person to ever exist, in addition to being an extremely hot and busty woman with a face of a model, at the age of 12. And she was expected to grow even more. To go beyond what was already meant to be impossible for humans. She was going to be titanic.<br />
It may have scared most people to think of that, but with Samantha’s wish to enjoy her height and breasts, it filled her with excitement.<br />
<br />
As she squeezed into her parent’s car, her breasts taking up a lot of room in front of her, Samantha made a wish to make sure the doctor’s prediction was true.<br />
“I wish that I still have a lot more to grow in puberty”</p>
