<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s understand of this whole device could theoretical do whatever the hell he wants with it. Make himself a god, sure; make the world some fantasy land where he&#39;s the hero of the tale, certainly tempting but it all seems a little cliche for it to be used like this. The problem was however that despite an endless amount of possibilities, every idea he had came up empty. <br />
<br />
With a sigh of breath and an absolute loss on what kind of world he wanted to create. He needed some inspiration and an idea on what way to use. He looked around his room, looking for some sort of inspiration. His eyes showered each device and item in it until he found a small portrait of him and his sister taking a ride on some horses.<br />
<br />
With the idea of horses in his head, and a gradually thought of a worldwide change, his plan was set into motion and the specific world created by the chronivac would be realised. Exchange the roles of humans and horses, a very clever and very simple change but one that could definitely have interesting results.<br />
<br />
By looking through the chronivac, he managed to find a pre-made version of his desired world, programmed with specific biological and some historical changes. Evolutionary lines and differences being very diverse to the main earth timeline.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t act rashly and took time to properly understand each intrinsical detail of the preset the chronivac came with. It displayed detailed diagrams of both the new iterations of human and horses, with individual oragans and behaviours described in heavy detail. <br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Humans:<br />
Quadrapedal organisms with hooves on each individual leg. They are very strong and quick organisms that can reach up to 88km/h if given the chance to. They are strictly vegetarian and have a typical diet of grain and grass.<br />
<br />
There structure is strictly quadraped. Their legs end in holes and are very thin until it reaches closer to the torso. The torso of humans are a huge, barrel like shape, with a very distinct and powerful muscles indicated by the tough hide of humans. Each human however contains a very large and fat containing ass, which is where most of the fat is stored in humans. Females typically contain more fat then a male and contain a larger ass then males. Females in fact store a lot more fat that their upper torso contains breasts that act as an extra storage molecule to store fat that will later be used for energy during reproduction and pregnancy. Sometimes though, males can develop breasts if they don&#39;t get enough exercise.<br />
<br />
Due to the biological differences, males are able to run faster and are far more active then females due to a decrease in body mass and fat. They naturally eat less and are more typically used by horses as athletic humans for racing. Female humans are typically used for dressage and regular riding lessons for beginners or intermediate riders.<br />
<br />
Human reproduction is a yearly thing that occurs during late march through to May. Throughout the year, male humans will build up seven within their testicle to be used for breeding. An indication of the amount of dementia a male produces is based on the size of the testicles during the reproduction months. They usually have a diameter of 5 cm but can increase up 6 times that amount. They do this to maximise the amount of females they can fertilise. Horses maintaining the well being of male humans have to forcefully make the human ejaculate as leaving the male with bulbous testicles can lead to infection and increased level of stress. Breeding males usually release their sperms into females. Male humans have a very large penis, reaching an average of 17 inches when fully erect, but these are usually flaccid and stored in a sheath. The tip of the pens is a very distinctive pink colour and have a very bulbous tip, similar to the tips of wild grown mushrooms. This feature helps the male human to stay withing the female to release as much sperms as possible.<br />
<br />
Female humans contain a very uniquely designed vagina and reproductive system. If a male ejaculates into a female, once the males pulls out, the female will forcefully close their vagina to restrict the escape of sperm. The muscles within the female&#39;s reproductive system will push the seven into a chamber that is connected to the bladder and womb. The womb, which contains the released egg, will have muscles that allow a small amount of the sperms into it that will fertile the egg while the sperm in the chamber will be excreted out with urine. The smell of seven and urine is a indicator to other males that the female has been mated with already. The vagina of the female is uniquely combined with the asshole to produce a single multipurpose hole for multiple biological functions. The rim of the vagina is often very swollen looking and very sensitive to the female. If provoked without reason, the female can collapse out of the intense impulse from being touched. <br />
<br />
Other distinct features of humans is a very hairy tail just above the anus of males and females. This tail is used mainly as a way of attracting mates but it also used as a way to swat flies that try landing on the skin of the human. Humans mostly look hairless from a distance but are in fact covered in very thin strands of hair. Some places on the skin have them more visible, such and the area around the genitals and anus or a very obvious path on the tail and head. It&#39;s more obvious to see the strands of hair on males then it is females.<br />
<br />
Horses:<br />
Bipedal organisms with a very high intellect. The predominant species of planet earth and have a population of 7 billion on the planet alone. <br />
<br />
They have formed several countries and religions, developing science math and languages. Despite being divided into nations, war and conflict is very much rare and the last war was over 20 years ago.<br />
<br />
Horses are covered in a very obvious coat of fur, which was brought from the evolutionary path of their ancestors. They contain a mane of fur on the top of their head which is styled into many unique designs. Fashion and accessories were originally born from nobles who loved to express themselves with their manes.<br />
<br />
Horses wear clothes with are designed to cover up certain parts if the body. Due to their fur however, clothes can be very irritating and only the bare minimum of what is needed to be worn to cover up the essentials is worn. Some individuals may wear more then necessary if they want to be unique. For a male, they will typically wear a large pouch like thong to contain their normally 6 inch penis&#39; and testicles. Some males have been know to wear strap like vests or other simple clothes around the torso. Females typically wear a simple pantie design to cover up the vagina located between the legs while the anus doesn&#39;t have to be covered up at all since it&#39;s between two ass cheeks. Some felaes have to wear a bra if they contain very large teats and mammary glands which are located on the chest. This is to prevent damage to the skin if the skin flaps too much.<br />
<br />
Horses also need to wear shoes due to have very sensitive feat on hard service and these feet contain 10 digits in total which provide stability for horses. They also contain hands that have been useful in the survival of the species and creation of tools.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Fully reading the biological preset through and leaving the other parts of it since he couldn&#39;t read it all due to how lengthy it was, Jeff ultimately went with it and activated the chronivac. By this point he was aware his memories would be gone and he would become a simple minded creature in body and head, but if he does end up getting restored. It be a very interesting ride and memories.</p>
