<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A group of preteen boys were out exploring, they were walking alongside railroad track when they found a stone, a shinning rock and what seemed to be the end of a rainbow. The kids were named Henry, Andrew, Keith, and Billy. They were all pretty good friends. Billy ran trying to catch the end of the rainbow while the rest just followed him from behind.<br />
<br />
“What is it??” Andrew asked Billy.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, I guess it’s some sort of rock, but look, it shines like a rainbow!” Billy replied excitedly.<br />
<br />
“That’s dumb, Rocks don&#39;t shine.” Henry said. “Maybe it gold or a jewel! We can get some money from it!”<br />
<br />
Keith walked past the arguing boys and took the stone to watch it at detail without saying a word to the others.<br />
<br />
“Hey! I saw it first! It&#39;s mine!” Billy shouted.<br />
<br />
“No! You didn’t! I did!” Andrew yelled.<br />
<br />
“All of you need to shut up! I&#39;m trying to know if it&#39;s actually valuable.” Keith said but the other boys ignoring him and They all went to grab it but ended up getting a handful of dirt and dust.<br />
<br />
They noticed that Keith had ran from them and now he was already far enough away. Cause they couldn’t snatch it out of his hands, they groaned.<br />
<br />
“Will you let me look at it peacefully?” He asked his friends. “It shines but not in a normal way.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe it&#39;s magical and it can give magic powers, or a magic sword, or grants wishes!!” Billy said excitedly, they all stared at him and laughed.<br />
<br />
“Magic isn’t real, you’re being dumb,” Andrew replied.<br />
<br />
“Well, at least try it.” Billy said a little ashamed after his friends laughed at him.<br />
<br />
“Alright then, give me superpowers!!” Keith shouted while he held it up. “Give me a magic sword.” Nothing seemed to happen, but his friends took his distraction to try taking the stone from his hands. “Hey! I thought you won&#39;t keep trying to take it from me! Argh! Sometimes I wish you were adults instead of kids!”<br />
<br />
After he said that last sentence, suddenly and unexpected from everyone. A big rainbow cloud covered them all and when it vanished instead of four 11 year old boys there were one 11 year old boy and three 21 year old men. Their childish clothes were now tattered around their big and strong bodies. They all stared in awe at their newly adulted selves.<br />
<br />
“What the heck!?” Andrew screamed as he looked at his beefy arms and the pelt of hair in his chest. Henry and Billy were doing quite the same, they can&#39;t believe what had just happened.<br />
<br />
“No way! This stones is actually a real magic stone!” Keith shouted while he looked at the adult version of his friends. They all towered over him now.<br />
<br />
“I feel so weird.” Henry said but he immediately closed his mouth with his hands when he realized that his voice had gone through a drastic change. It was funny to think he had the highest pitch before and now he has the deepest.<br />
<br />
“This is awesome! We&#39;re grownups! We can do grownups things now!!” Billy cheered excitedly while he raised his arms in happiness. Everyone can see the bushes of hair that had appeared on his armpits. It was weird for Henry and Andrew to think about it, knowing that they had suddenly grown armpit hair too.<br />
<br />
“No, this isn&#39;t right. You&#39;re a bunch of almost naked men, we will be in trouble if someone sees you. I need to turn you back to 11 years old right now.” Keith said as he hold the stone with both hands. “Turn them back to normal.”<br />
<br />
“Nothing happened.” Andrew replied while he looked around and notices that Billy and Henry still were as big as him. “You’re doing something wrong. Give it to me.”<br />
<br />
He tried to take the stone from Keith&#39;s hands, but the preteen refused and ran from them like he did before.<br />
<br />
“The stone is mine, I will find the way to turn you back!” Keith replied while he holds the stone again with both hands. “Please, turn my friends back to their preadolescent state.”<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t work again, and judging by the look in Andrew&#39;s face, he was getting quite impatient about it.<br />
<br />
“I heard a voice.” Henry said while he looked at the woods nearby. “Someone is coming.”<br />
<br />
“We need to hide somewhere while Keith figures out how to turn us back to normal.” Andrew said. “Come on, follow me. I know a place not far from here.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t want to run. My shoes are killing me!” Billy protested. “My feet are too big for them!”<br />
<br />
“Then take them off.” Andrew replied. “I’d done that the second I realized my feet didn&#39;t fit in them anymore.”<br />
<br />
“But.” Billy tried to protest again but he realized it was pointless. He tore his shoes off and ran barefoot just like Andrew and Henry were doing. It was uncomfortable, but way more less uncomfortable than trying to fit his size 13 feet in his size 8 shoes.<br />
<br />
Now, Keith and his three adult friends were running through the woods looking for a place to hide while Keith finds out a way to make reversal puberty on them.</p>
