<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An air of confusion had been hanging over the world for a few months now. Ever since the scientific community was put into shock by the appearance of a large, fist-shaped crater on the surface of the moon, unprecedented occurrences had become increasingly commonplace. The cryptozoologists and conspiracy theorists of the world were sent into a mess of activity, with strange creature sightings being reported at nearly triple the normal frequency, and with far more convincing evidence than the typical blurry photo. Numerous museums, jewelry stores, and art galleries around the globe had their reputations thrown into shambles as seemingly impossible burglaries were committed, robbing them of their priciest possessions. Any one of the acts would have been reported as the heist of the century, had it not been for the fact that at least two happened every week.<br />
While this all was happening, more weird going-ons went underway, farther from the public’s attention. Numerous young men started receiving cryptic messages through various social media sites, leading them through a digital rabbit chase. Regardless of where it started, those curious enough to follow the chains and links left through each post found themselves bouncing from Facebook to unlisted Youtube videos, anonymous message boards to long dead hobbyist forums, all in pursuit of the words of a mysterious author who signed each message with a single “J”. After several days of searching, those who were patient, bored, or engrossed enough to play these games were rewarded by a simple message of “You’re Invited”. Within mere hours of finding that final link, an envelope made of a smooth, thin sheet of leather found its way to their doors. Some people did try to report the letters to the police, and some people just simply ignored them, but in both cases, the letters themselves vanished without a trace.<br />
Those who opened the letters found themselves looking at a picture of a strikingly gorgeous woman and a single geographical coordinate that pointed towards a remote stretch of the New Mexico badlands. This was obvious bait for most, but there were a select few who were so taken aback by this woman’s beauty, as well as the immense intrigue of the entire situation, that they couldn’t help but take their cars down the dusty highways towards the marked location.<br />
John was one of those people. Fortunate enough to own a durable pickup given his somewhat meager earnings, he was able to make the whole journey from his home in Southern California without too much difficulty. He stepped out of the car. John was a rather good looking man; full head of black hair, fairly well kept patch of stubble. There wasn’t too much definition to his figure, but he still had the body shape to carry himself with a good deal of confidence. Unfortunately, John was never successful with the ladies, presumably because he was the type of man who would go to strange coordinates in the middle of the desert simply because a pretty face told him to. Needless to say, he wasn’t the wisest person around, and many people were turned off by his spaced-out demeanor. <br />
John wasn’t too sure what he was expecting, but he certainly knew what he was meant to see. In the side of the mesa he had stopped against, the gaping mouth of a cave was easy to spot given the barrenness of his surroundings, especially since it seemed to be illuminated with a string of electric lights that were lined down the walls, vanishing into its depths. Steeling his nerves, he walked into and down the rocky corridor, deeper into the cave.<br />
____________________________________________________________________________<br />
Jennifer was in the midst of staring at her hand, or at the very least, the bones of her hand. She was sitting in a plush chair; one arm using a laptop displaying the anatomy of the human hand, another was holding onto a cold glass of orange juice, and her third arm was raised right in front of her face, under close examination. This third arm was coated in flesh up to a few inches below the wrist, where it ended in a stump. Extending out of this stump was the skeletal structure that made up the rest of her forearm, hand, and fingers. As she watched, strands of muscle danced their way from the flesh of her wrist up alongside her fingers, bunching tightly at the base of the thumb and pinky. Glancing over at the laptop, she saw that things were satisfactory, and wrapped the entire thing up in a coating of her flawless skin. Now just as functional as the other two, her newly reforged hand closed the laptop and tucked it under her arm. The hand that had been using the laptop just prior was sucked back into her shoulders, and she took a sip of her juice, emptying the glass. <br />
It was a bit boring to do some of the more mundane practices, but there still was a good deal of fascination to be found for her in the act of learning and discovery. She had realized she needed the exercise after a close call she had during her latest luxury restaurant outing. Having stolen the form of a famous Hollywood actress, Jennifer was enjoying a flawlessly cooked steak on a balcony overlooking downtown Paris when she caught herself picking up her fork with a quadruple-jointed set of fingers. Fortunately, the waitstaff hadn’t noticed, but it was a clear sign that she needed to remind herself of humanity’s creaky limits, lest she end up with unnecessary complications in her personal paradise.  <br />
She crossed from the living room to the kitchen to deposit her now empty glass. A permanent residence seemed somewhat unnecessary to someone like her, given that she spent plenty of time roaming the world, exploring the wilderness, and taking in culture. However, the luxury of a mansion was one of the human pleasures that, like the food and drink she still was still happy to consume, was too good to pass up. <br />
Up until about four months ago, she was content enough simply making herself at home in the unused vacation homes of the rich and powerful. However, she eventually felt the desire for something to call her own. Knowing that simply purchasing a house would be a grievous waste of her unique talents, she had set off on a personal mission to create her own perfect haven. <br />
Her very first foray into homemaking had run into the same problem that she had run into several months ago when she had formed a boyfriend from her own flesh. The mutability of her first undertaking provided many benefits, but lacked the physicality of a true work of art. Some say that a big part of creativity is learning how to work around limitations, something Jennifer lacked severely. She found herself annoyed by her perfectionist urges when every detail of the house could be changed with but a thought. Walls and furniture were changed multiple times a day, only for a better idea to pop into her mind an hour later. She needed a home she could learn to love, and something that could be a relaxing constant in the ever shifting adventure of her life. <br />
The answer had came to her one morning as she awoke from a steamy dream-filled night in a unoccupied Manhattan highrise to the sight of a ravishing woman at the foot of her bed with her head firmly shoved in between Jennifer’s thighs, expertly stimulating her most sensitive spots with the constant motion of a writhing mass of tongue. After punching the woman clear across the room out of sheer instinct with a fist roughly the size, shape, and density of an anvil, she was shocked to see the woman burst into flesh colored clay upon hitting the opposite wall. Willing the clay to come back to her, she was stunned further to realize that the woman had indeed been created from her own malleable body. For the first time since receiving her powers, Jennifer was both surprised and inspired by something she had done, surpassing limits she didn’t even realize she had.<br />
Over the next week, Jennifer studied the nature, and more specifically the control, of her dreams. Carefully timed alarms, audiobooks that played while she slept, and regular meditation all contributed towards the domination of her subconscious she desired through targeted lucid dreaming. <br />
After a substantial amount of practice, she had her first breakthrough when she was able to awaken next a clone of herself that was able to act with an individual, yet limited, amount of agency. After having the greatest sexual experience of her life thus far, she shifted her focus towards using this technique on creating her own living space.<br />
Her first attempt ended in failure. Despite the thoughts of her dream mansion filling her sleeping head, she awoke to a sea of abstract shapes and colors that twisted and contorted over five solid acres. The second attempt didn’t fare much better, but the from the third attempt onward, she began to see promising results. The first structures that were recognizable as such were practically Seussian in nature, and completely devoid of an interior, but it was progress nonetheless. Within another week, she had done it, filling a cavern she had dug herself in the New Mexico badlands with a mansion worthy of the gods. Gold ornamented the walls and the floors were polished marble, the furniture was as soft and comfortable as it could possibly be and there was ample space to display the countless works of art she had pilfered from the world’s greatest collections. She later had to wire the lights, appliances, and internet herself, as it seemed that one of the few things her shapeshifting couldn’t do was generate electricity. She went about, robbing all the supplies and gadgets she needed and spending sleepless nights teaching herself the skills to properly utilize them. She still could at any point change the structure in its entirety, something she reminded herself of frequently whenever she decided to let herself be absorbed into the walls as a form of meditation, but the experience of ”finding” this house, fully formed, allowed her to form a clear mental distinction between self and residence.<br />
Jennifer’s thoughts were interrupted by the telltale rush of pleasure she gained when she felt a foot step solidly on the carnally-sensitive patch of flesh she had left in the mouth of the cave, disguised as a rock. It seemed that one of her pet projects had bared fruit yet again… <br />
____________________________________________________________________________ <br />
John had been descending a good five minutes before the winding, rocky corridor had finally opened up into a huge open cavern. The still-jagged walls curved around a massive floor that was significantly smoother than any other surface in the cave, to the point of appearing like marble. The ceiling reached so high above the floor that it was difficult to see the top through the clouds of mist that collected among the stalactites. The most astonishing feature, however, was the massive, four-story mansion that sat in the direct center of the floorspace. It was incredibly modern and had the unique distinction of lacking any type of glass windows or doors. Instead, every wall seemed to be formed from solid sheets of pitch-black obsidian, cut into massive rectangular panels and decorated with golden vine patterns. The pathway to the massive set of double doors was lined on both sides with still, reflective pools. Dotted among these pools were platforms on which numerous statues were on display. John was no appreciator of fine art, but even he was shocked to see the famous figure of David, whose disappearance ten days ago made international headlines. Filled with a brimming sense of both fear and curiosity, John raised a hand and knocked on the black doors.<br />
Several seconds passed before the doors opened soundlessly. Jennifer stood directly in the center of the doorframe, looking her guest over. She was glad John had decided to make the journey. She only sent out invitations to the most attractive men she could find, and out of all of them, he seemed to play the games she put him through with the greatest amount of gusto and enthusiasm. She was currently in what she considered to be her favorite form; the same one that was seen on every one of the letters she had sent: a six-foot statuesque stunner with supermodel features, a tanned skin complexion that made placing her ethnicity difficult, and long black hair that flowed freely to accentuate her immaculate curves. She was dressed in a very loose black dress. From the waist up, it only covered her front and draped gently over her breasts, her back and shoulders exposed to the dry cave air. From the waist down, it flowed gently over her prominent hips all the way down to the floor, leaving no part of her lower half visible. The effect of this, beyond simply looking elegant, allowed her to fuse her two legs together into a single column that flowed directly into her waist. Using this hidden column, she was able to glide across the floor with ethereal grace, like a ballroom dancer, adding to her otherworldly allure.<br />
“I’m glad to see you, John. Please, follow me.”<br />
John couldn’t help but follow the woman who had been dominating his imagination for days as the double doors closed behind him. Having received the letter on a Monday, he had spent several long nights alone, gazing at the single picture as he waited for the chance to make the journey over the weekend. Now that same woman was directly in front of him, leading him down a polished corridor. The black and gold of the exterior was now replaced by a clean white interior, with marble flooring and more stolen masterpieces framed on the walls. She was even more beautiful in person, moving with mechanical deliberation, yet with the fluidity of a gymnast. The woman stopped at a door, which proceeded to open automatically. She beckoned him inside, and he obliged immediately.<br />
The first thing John noticed was the large bed in the middle of the room, the implications of which made it hard to focus on anything else. However, he was able to contain his emotions long enough to take notice of another point of interest. On the wall hung a framed photograph of the woman, dressed as she was now, on the surface of the moon. Anyone who had seen a newspaper in the past year would recognize the landmark she was standing next to as Manus Crater, the one-hundred-foot-wide, fist-shaped impact mark that seemingly appeared overnight to the shock of practically every person on Earth. However, the most striking feature of the photo was the woman’s right arm, which was clearly holding the camera due to the way it extended out of frame. Not unusual on its own, but the fact that the camera had to be at least 15 feet away from her was. Even the part that was still in the shot had an unnatural curve to it and seemed to lack an elbow entirely. John began to slowly piece together the things he was seeing as the woman followed him inside, with the door closing behind her.<br />
____________________________________________________________________________<br />
	This was the part Jennifer loved the most. She watched as John stared at the photographic evidence of her capabilities, compiling everything he had just seen in his short time in her home. His silent acceptance was promising; while receiving horrified gasps and fervent worship was fun at times, few things grew tiresome faster than hearing people ask “how” or “why”, or being told the scientific reasons that she couldn’t exist. The whole reason for her online chases was to find people like John; people who would let her changes just roll over them, and become a living sounding board for her experimentations in form, not to mention allowing her to satisfy some more base desires. <br />
Finally allowing herself to flow freely, Jennifer moved gracefully through the air, stretching herself across the room by the torso to where he was standing. Her dress, naturally, lengthened along with her.  Feeling her long expanse of torso brush up beside him, John turned his head to see her elongated form, confirming what he had begun to believe. Finally finding the voice to speak, he asked, “The crater… that was you?” Jennifer nodded her head with a knowing smile. “And the robberies? And the monster sightings? And… the envelope… that was made of…” Jennifer cut him off, “Yes, yes, and yes” she responded. John’s mind was racing at a mile a minute. “And you want… me?” Jennifer did a loop around his waist with her still-extending torso, placing herself in front of him from the waist up, and behind him from the waist down. She had developed proper legs, and walked closer to him. <br />
“I seem to recall you wanting me first.” Jennifer replied with a smug smile. John sheepishly tried to break eye contact, but her serpentine neck was able to keep up with any attempts to shift his gaze. “John, I want this, and I know you want this too. I saw what you did with the letter. Let’s not waste any more time.” <br />
John blushed furiously as Jennifer’s body blossomed into a flurry of activity. Long loops extended out of her torso, clutching the corners of the bed and grappling it closer to them. John had begun undressing, and the clothes he discarded were grabbed by arms that rose and sank from the floor itself, taking them to unknown reaches of the huge mansion. He got onto the bed, and the sensation of sinking slightly into the soft surface provided an immense feeling of relief and comfort as the bed seemed to gently hug him with subtle, gentle movements. Looking back up from his now reclined position, he saw the great lengths of Jennifer’s form loom over him, descending upon the bed. However, instead of getting on it, her long arms reached around it, solidifying into a solid arc. Her torso, at the foot of the bed, went completely straight and rigid, the black and tan of her dress and skin changing to a solid brown tone, not unlike polished wood. Her entire body became completely unrecognizable as she became a cubelike frame surrounding the entire bed. As a finishing touch, soft silks with intricate patterns spooled out of the upper beams and and over the top of the bed. Within no more than ten seconds, Jennifer’s gorgeous figure had turned into an ornate bed canopy. John looked around in confusion, suddenly finding himself alone, when he heard Jennifer&#39;s sultry voice yet again.<br />
“While privacy isn’t really a concern around here, I must say that these drapes provide such a sense of intimacy.” John turned his head just in time to see Jennifer’s head sprout out of the surface of the bed, followed by her chest, arms, torso, hips and legs. Momentarily, her surface was comprised of the same patterned sheets found on the surface of the bed, but with a toss of her hair, the soft texture of her skin creeped down her body, finally allowing John to have a look at her unclothed form. <br />
For the first time since John had arrived, Jennifer’s body was fully human in shape, but that normality did not last long. In the blink of an eye, she was on him, with lengths of her body embracing John from both sides in a single, continuous curve. Looking him in the eyes, she began to slowly shift and transform her face and features. The changes were subtle at first, to the point that it took him a moment to realize anything was happening at all, but soon enough watched in wonder as a spectrum of beautiful faces danced through his field of vision. Jennifer enhanced her vision, a simple enough trick, but one that she had mastered to the point of having no detectable cosmetic changes when active. She looked over his subtle changes in expression, watching for the tells she knew would indicate when she hit the jackpot. Moments later, a small interruption of breathing and a shift in the pupils proved she had reached it. She looked herself over. Her skin was far paler, and her long black hair had shortened and waved, becoming red in the process and just brushing against the top of her shoulders. Freckles dotted her face and her eyes had turned a light blue. She didn’t know if this figure was a childhood crush, favorite porn star, or merely a personal preference, but she knew she had found John’s ideal.<br />
Seeing his full arousal, Jennifer straightened herself out, and latched onto his limbs. John could hardly make out what happened next, but he suddenly found himself facing downwards and with Jennifer yet again nowhere to be seen. But just as before, the bed itself boiled with activity as John found himself face-to-face with Jennifer yet again, but now with himself on top. <br />
Swiftly maneuvering herself to align their bodies, Jennifer’s awaiting slit extended itself slowly, guiding John’s manhood onto itself until it was able to take in the full length. Being a mere human, John’s shaft, while not by any means small, was hardly the foot-long, inches-wide, indestructible monsters that Jennifer had created and treated herself to when she had first gained her powers. Nevertheless, Jennifer had become wiser in her months of practice and had  well mastered the treatment of any size she came across, her rudimentary clitoral meat-grinder having been replaced by far more subtle, but just as effective, techniques.<br />
John felt himself enter deeper and deeper as he felt the walls of flesh surrounding him morph and change in both shape and texture. He felt the cavity shrink, closing around him for a perfect fit. The external slit began to close, forming a seal around the circumference of his rod as the unseen folds of flesh began to move up and down, giving a stroking motion that no human woman could replicate. Topping it all off, John felt a tendril form from deep within her and begin to coil itself, looping several times around his immersed member. The expertly controlled strokes put John into an immediate state of bliss. His arms felt like jelly, and he soon found himself about to faceplant into Jennifer’s reclined figure. Fortunately, what should have been a sickening crunch, probably followed by a broken nose, instead resulted in him merely bouncing off of her highly elastic body, earning a giggle from Jennifer as she looked at his surprised face.<br />
Jennifer hardly bothered to form a clitoris these days, as simply allowing the entire region to inherit its sensitivity proved to be a far easier option. Despite her mind reeling with pleasure, Jennifer had long overcome the rampant distortions of her body that she experienced several months ago, which had caused her to explode uncontrollably into chaotic forms as she approached climax. With no loss of physical sensation, the greatest loss of control she would go through nowadays was either the occasional ripple that would travel up and down her body or a plasticy shine that overtook her natural skin texture. However, she wasn&#39;t about to let her sense of self-control get in the way of pushing her abilities to the limit. Detecting the approaching climax, she began to put her grand finale into motion.<br />
John felt an immediate shift in Jennifer’s body, but couldn’t tell what exactly had changed. It wasn’t until he attempted to readjust himself that he suddenly felt his hand become immersed in something warm and smooth. Directing his gaze to the point of sensation, John saw his hand pushed firmly through her upper arm, a perfectly circular ripple forming from the intersection and expanding in all directions, dissipating at the elbow and shoulder. He momentarily jolted back in the fear that he had injured her, pulling away his hand and causing bits of her now liquified form to splash across the bedsheets. His fears were alleviated though when he saw her smiling face, beaming in both satisfaction and amusement. John dutifully went back to his thrusting, now feeling the swirl of a thick, smooth liquid rush around his penis in addition to the glut of other pleasures and sensations that continued to bring him ever closer to the summit of sensation.<br />
Inching toward her own breaking point, Jennifer broke into melodious laughter as she her contained liquid form began to flow outward, increasing her size. The sensation of both being in constant motion from her swirling liquid while consciously keeping a humanoid template provided a fascinating duality for Jennifer as she continued to shift her position. Growing larger still and beginning to pull her body upright, Jennifer bonelessly adjusted both her and John’s position. John was now on his back once again, head facing the foot of the bed as Jennifer’s form, looking like a flesh-colored sea goddess whose body was the ocean itself, towered over him. John was in the midst of a small scale tempest as Jennifer’s liquid form crashing in waves around him. Her lower body was completely lost in the waves and flows, yet their connection remained, John’s manhood still being pleasured at the eye of the storm. From above the waist, she contained her cohesion, yet across the surface, the rushing currents of her flesh created subtle tells of the sheer morphic energy that was contained within. Her freckles were carried to and fro, tracing dark lines across her shoulders, and her bright red hair began to drip onto the surface of the bed. With just seconds before release, she swooped down with the parts that were still recognizable as such, and as the climax hit, she planted a kiss on his surprised face.<br />
John’s release was pleasurable and intense, yet any emissions he mustered up were swiftly lost in Jennifer’s form, which, in the throes of ecstasy, had completely relinquished all solidity. John was in the midst of a rushing river, a red and pink jacuzzi that eased out all the tension that had built up during his rise to climax. The flows of Jennifer’s body trailed off the bed and under the canopy, leaving John alone once again, his mind reeling at what had just happened. <br />
Jennifer’s body pooled together just outside the curtains, taking on the black haired form she currently perceived as her base. She was very pleased with John’s performance, and her first attempt at a shaped liquidation, or “slime”, had went as well as she could have hoped.<br />
John had been one of her best finds, but things unfortunately were about to come to an end. Not wanting her visitors to think themselves welcome to her home at any point, the last step of Jennifer’s hospitality involved making sure that her guest would want to forget ever venturing there in the first place. It truly was a shame when it came to real sweethearts like John, but it was a necessary evil in her eyes. Jennifer thought of various monstrous features she could go with, but ultimately decided to run with tonight’s theme. <br />
She liquified yet again, but this time, she allowed her anatomy to be completely demolished by the changes. Her skin darkened, going far past any realistic tone and deepening to a color not unlike tar or oil. The only spot of color left was found in her eyes, which glowed red with an inner fire. Wanting to ensure the success of her plan, she pushed her horrific aspects even further, growing a myriad of bones that pushed through the surface of the black mass, implying a history of prior victims. Raising a pseudopod, she grew spindly, needle-like fingers and reached out towards the curtain, preparing for the screaming that was to come.<br />
“So… if you can just, y’know, melt into a liquid like that, can you become a gas?” <br />
John’s sudden voice cut through her concentration. Slapping together a pair of lips, she responded, the rest of her body quickly catching up and re-humanizing. “Well of course- wait- yes?” Jennifer was annoyed, she hadn’t even thought of this possibility. “Hold on one sec.” She waved her arm and the whole room vacated; the bed, canopy, picture, and furniture all melting into the walls. John was left sitting naked on the stone floor that thankfully was not as cold as it looked. Jennifer’s once reverberant voice, dripping with both allure and power, now spoke with a underwhelmingly casual tone. <br />
“What are you even talking about?”<br />
John shrugged his shoulders, “I dunno. I’m sorry if I said something wrong…” he trailed off. “It just looked like you were showing off to me, and I was thinking...well... maybe you wanted some ideas.” He looked back at her, “So, is that possible?”<br />
Jennifer wasn’t sure if she should be offended or not. Here she was, putting on some sort of divine display of shock and awe, and then comes this man, giving her pointers. But try as she might, she wasn’t able to find the anger within herself to retaliate. <br />
Jennifer turned away. She understood the basic mechanics of how she liquified; somehow she manipulated whatever matter she was made of to vibrate and lose the structure of a solid. Whether her body was actually made of atoms was something she hadn’t taken the effort to come to a conclusion on, but if whatever she was comprised of followed at least somewhat closely to basic material laws, what she was planning should work. <br />
Jennifer liquified in a split second, not wasting any time on theatrics, and began to concentrate. She honed her concentration onto the sensation of the flowing motion within her. She increased her focus, looking deep within herself. There. She felt the vibrations of herself rushing about in an indefinite shape, yet with uniform purpose. She latched onto the sensation and began to amplify it. The feeling that followed reminded her of biting onto an electric toothbrush and watching the entire world around you wiggle about. Further and further she pushed herself. She closed her eyes and limited her senses to nothing but the touch and feeling of herself at the microscopic level. Several moments passed in complete isolation, with nothing but her inner churning to accompany her, until suddenly, she felt the motion stop. She still felt the tingles travel all over her, but it was now accompanied by a tranquil stillness of her general  form.<br />
Jennifer opened an eye and John still sitting there, facing her, mouth slightly slack with amazement. She opened the other and suddenly saw the conflicting image of him facing away. Multiple viewpoints was something she knew how to deal with, but it was still disorienting when not expected. She accustomed herself to this new input and surveyed her surroundings. From her full 360-degree viewpoint she saw that the whole room, bare as she had left it, was now shrouded in a soft pink mist. It didn’t take too long to realize what had happened. <br />
Jennifer let out a laugh, one of the most genuine she had in months, her mouth coalescing from the vapors in one of the corners of the room. John joined in, finding her pure joy and cheerful laugh to be incredibly contagious. He saw the two clouds that made up her eyes draw together, as wisps merged and twisted around them. The now wraithlike form of Jennifer slowly floated down to meet him. Swirling around him like a spring breeze, John was treated to the smells of fruits and flowers as she “sat” next to him, the currents of air rustling his hair as she came to a stop.<br />
“Well, I guess I can. Who would have thought.” Jennifer said with a wink. In her incorporeal state, her words didn’t come from her mouth as much as they simply were formed out of the vapors and pushed around by the currents of herself she commandeered. <br />
“Yeah, I guess so.” John said.<br />
Jennifer gave him a devilish smile.<br />
“Any other ideas?”<br />
____________________________________________________________________________<br />
For many hours, Jennifer and John simply sat together, coming up with new and exciting forms to try. John truly was an inspiration for her, consistently surprising her many times with his bizarre suggestions. Later in the night, they shared a meal together and later cuddled up on her living room couch to watch some television. Eventually, John’s human limitations became increasingly demanding as he collapsed, tired after a long day. In his last moments of consciousness, he felt the couch stretch and contort as a large sheet of warm, soft material wrap around him as he drifted off into a deep sleep.<br />
____________________________________________________________________________<br />
	John woke up with a start, bumping his head on the ceiling of his car. A jolt of soreness from sitting uncomfortably sparked in his lower back and spread through his limbs. Thoughts of a luxurious mansion, a thrilling revelation, and an enchanting woman played through his mind. A momentary smile flashed on his face, but quickly fell as he acknowledged the sheer impossibility of what he thought happened. Scanning the horizon, there was no trace of the cave he had found yesterday. Darker theories crossed his mind. Drugs? Insanity? Kidnapping? He checked under his shirt, looking for possible scars and stitches, fortunately finding none. <br />
He started up his car. Seeing that at the very least his tank was still mostly full, he set his mind on heading home and putting this strange situation behind him. He pulled into drive, and slowly lifted his foot off of the brakes.<br />
“Leaving so soon?” John heard a familiar voice, and stopped the car. “And here I was, expecting a good bye.”<br />
John turned his head, looking for the source, before settling his eyes on the passenger seat. A single sheet of paper lay flat; pure white and unwrinkled. John turned it over to see a set of lipstick marks in the center of the opposite side. The lips spoke, flashing a big smile. <br />
“Sorry for dashing! The Louvre clearly hasn’t learned its lesson yet and put a bea-utiful statue on display that I have just GOT to have.” John felt himself tearing up. It was real. SHE was real. The paper continued, “Aww, don’t get upset. I know we had fun, but I got a bunch of plans I still want to get to.” A pair of pencil-drawn lines appeared on the paper, twisting about and forming two simple eyes. One of the eyes winked. “And after that, I’m sure we’ll see each other again.”<br />
The eyes and mouth gave him a more serious look. “Really, I mean it. I enjoyed our time together.” Expression brightening, the face gave one last beaming smile. “If you ever need me, you know where to find me!”<br />
And with that, the paper crumpled up, morphing in texture. Once fully balled, it smoothed into a flat slab and gold creeped up its surface. Shrinking down, the golden object twisted into a skinny rectangle, before curving on one end. A small loop of gold sprouted out of the surface. John was now holding a simple gold ring in his hand. He slipped it on, looking at the symbol on the front. A single “J” was now visible against his knuckles.<br />
John tapped the ring. <br />
“Hey- you still listening?”<br />
“Yes?” A tiny voice responded.<br />
“Can I know your name?”<br />
A moment passed, but the voice once again spoke. <br />
“Jennifer. My name is Jennifer.”</p>
