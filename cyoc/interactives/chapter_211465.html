<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Congratulations! It&#39;s a girl! A beautiful healthy baby girl!&quot; a voice greeted your arrival into the world. The same voice that had grabbed your head as you were struggling in that awfully tight birth canal. You had wanted to shout out your indignity because hey, that hurt! But all that came out was your first painful breathing scream. Painful for your lungs yet that pain receded at each intake. Te world was cold and too bright. The hands that clasped you way too firm and rigid. You wanted warmth and softness. You wanted your mommy. The feeling was rational yet it wasn&#39;t. Your brain got overwhelmed by basic infant urges, most just geared towards survival instincts. However, your brain still got hooked upon the information that you were a girl. A girl? No! There was a mistake! You are a boy! A boy! An adult, even! A young adult, but it&#39;s not supposed to be that way! You screamed harder because of this but to the doctor and nurses, you were just exercising your lungs more. At long last, they put you into the arms of your mother. You could glimpse her. Young. Pretty. But young, really. Why, she looked barely out of her teens, even! Or she was just very good and youthful- looking. The warmth that irradiated from her was soothing and comforting. She was exhausted and tense but she hugged you. Too briefly, but it was to settle you near her nipple. That made you smile inwardly. Lunch! What a good idea! Excellent, even! The smell of the few drops of leaking milk were impossible to resist. Famished, you latched on eagerly. Oh... Oh! Delicious! First choice! A part of you was disgusted at suckling milk out of a strange woman&#39;s tits but you stopped carting soon. Hey, you still had your young male mind and attacking with gusto a giant nipple while being near what was in comparison a gigantic boob was true bliss! Your mom&#39;s boobs were enormous! Maybe a bit siliconed but hey, who cared at that point? It was a great moment, and you even felt your eyes drooping. Were you falling asleep? Oh, well. You could suckle in your sleep, right? Nestled against humongous boobs would be awesome, sleeping or not! <br />
&quot;Ow!&quot;<br />
The mattress of boobs you were comfortable in jostled and two hands seized your middle and tore you from your precious teat and its snack. <br />
&quot;She bit me! She&#39;s full, anyway! Burp her and put her to bed! Go sleepy-byes! Give her a bottle in the future!&quot; snapped a voice very near you, your mother&#39;s.<br />
Hey! What was happening? What did she mean &#39;sleepy-byes&#39;? Hey! Someone, a nurse, was taking you away! You wanted your mommy&#39;s teat! You wanted your mommy&#39;s boob! Hey! Hey! Mommy! Mommy! But it was to no avail. The nurse washed you, diapered you and gave you a bottle, while you could still hear in your ears and mind your mother complaining that the birth had been horrible and that now you were biting her nipple and that she&#39;d be glad when they came to get you and got out of the hospital. &#39;They&#39;? Who were &#39;they&#39;? As you were given a bottle of milk, much to your chagrin, you started to think that maybe your mother didn&#39;t really intend to love you, let alone raise you. However, you were still an exhausted newborn baby so you drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
It turned out that your first impressions were right and they were quickly confirmed too. Your mother had been paid to be inseminated with an egg and then artificially fertilized by a homosexual man who wished to become a father. His partner had agreed and your surrogate mother had seemed like a good choice as she followed a healthy lifestyle. Carrying for other people allowed her to live comfortably and do as much plastic surgery as she liked. The egg that contained your soul had been sold as that of a healthy, gorgeous woman and everyone did say your were beautiful. After barely two weeks, two weeks of bottle-feeding and without your mommy, which distraught you in spite of knowing that she was only a surrogate and not even your real mother, a man had come to see you, all smiles and never tiring of smooching you and wriggling his fingers at you. He had a scruff on his face and bulging muscles but he rocked you with care and peppered you with kisses. He changed your diaper and bathed you and fed you, which Mommy never bothered to do, dressing you in various pink pyjamas too. It was weird, not as comforting as being with Mommy, all awful that she might be, but you sensed you could trust this very strange new Mommy. After a few days, he arrived, all exited, placed you in a baby carrier and took you back home, elated and telling you how everything was ready for you and how excited Dada would be. You just stared at him curiously. Sometimes, you could make sense of the world around you, but at others, you just got lost in your baby urges and interests. <br />
<br />
Time has passed and now you are in your toddler years. You remember less and less of your old life. At best, you knew you were at a Fountain of Youth, drank too much and someone took your form to then be reborn as a sort of made-to-order baby. But most of the time, your adult male thoughts just fade in the background. Who knew pink could be so pretty? Who knew hugs could be so comforting? It&#39;s like being a kid again, but having indulged in a potion of forgetfulness too. You can only toddle and addle around. When your diapers are changed, you see your own crotch. You know something bothered you about that before but what? It&#39;s a privacy, just like you&#39;ve always had and should have. You don&#39;t even remember your cries at seeing your privates gone, replaced by a slit as you were changed in your infancy, which everyone took to be just discomfort from the said diaper change. You love teddy bears, dolls, anything pink or princess-y and you actively move around the house like a little comet. Your daddies have trouble keeping up with you at the park! You love movies with pretty princesses, whether they grab swords themselves or merely sing with animals. And your daddies love you very, very much. They look at your honey-colored hair and light-blue eyes and think that the egg they purchased was holding indeed a magnificent daughter. A bit hyper-active but so sweet! Besides, a doll can keep you occupied in your playpen as a calm activity safely as well. Your memories got progressively and increasingly wiped out as you became fascinated with different things and found pleasure in clutching the legs of your strange mommy-daddy parents. They lull you to sleep and poke you and tickle you and pepper you with kisses. What other life could there possibly be? Being a boy, let alone an adult one, know seems preposterous and beyond your young realm of comprehension.</p>
