<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You walked down the hallway, stopped, walked back and then did this a couple more times, finally stopping when you realised that you were pacing back and forth. Peering into Megan's room, unsure if was even her room or some illusion created, you turn away, feeling disgusted and making your way down the hallway, you eventually make your way through the house, deciding that there was no way you could remain there if everything you knew was an illusion.<br />
<br />
Stopping just outside the front door, suddenly aware what you are wearing and what you are holding, it suddenly dawns on you that you have no idea where you should or could go and sitting down on the front stoop, feeling suddenly conspicuous, you shift your posture about, attempting to keep comfortable while at the same time keep the people on the sidewalk out front from see up your dress and seeing your privates.<br />
<br />
After a bit, you huff in frustration at the fact that no matter what you do, you cannot do both and standing you head back into the house, figure you do not want to be in something that was naught but an illusion and glancing down at the tights, slippers and wings, you quickly go over your option, decide in the long run what to do and heading for the living room, you sit down on the couch and, almost as if it come naturally to you, you slip on the tights, tucking your penis and testicles betwixt your legs without giving it a second thought as you do so, and then put on the slips and tie the lace straps so they offer your ankles and legs support.<br />
<br />
Standing, unsure how all of this even fits you, figuring it was something to do with what Megan explained and your feminine transformation, you huff again in frustration, pick up the wings, think about chucking them aside, and instead you spin about in place and march back to the front door and outside, where you once again take up your previous position on the front stoop, shifting so that you are somewhat comfortable, but not really caring now if somebody could see up your dress.<br />
<br />
As you set the wings down, you think about your choices, knowing that there was no way you were going to allow becoming a mindless beast be your choice. Understanding this to be a finality, you asked yourself, &quot;Could I find Megan's brother?&quot; but realised that you had nowhere to start and that if you did such a thing, it could very well take you anywhere from a day to certainly more than two days to locate him.<br />
<br />
Hugging yourself, you shift your position so that your feet and lower legs are curled up so that they are almost underneath your upper legs and adjusting the dress, you search you memory, attempting to remember what it had been like when you first had been transformed in a girl.<br />
<br />
In the end, the only thing you can remember is a couple girls and a lot of water and giving it up as lost, you run a hand down the dress, finding that you actually like the way the fabric feels and gently and inconspicuously touching the area between your legs, you make sure that your penis and testicles have not disappeared or become a girl's genitals while you have sat here.<br />
<br />
Sighing that your 'manhood' was still present, you focus back on the issue at hand, still unable to come up with a choice, except that you do not want to become a bitch poodle. Standing, you place your hands above your head so that it appeared like you had a steeple above you and moving your feet and legs, you start to go through several dance moves, a lot of the ballet, as you attempted to sort your thoughts and come to a decision on what you were going to tell Megan.<br />
<br />
As it suddenly dawns on you what you are doing, you suddenly drop your arms to your side and glance about, embarrassed and afraid that somebody might have seen you and feeling out of place, you turn and walking through the grass, you follow the edge of the house around and to the back, where you take a seat on the patio steps.<br />
<br />
Feet placed two steps below you, you lean forward and hugging your knees, unaware how much like a girl you look, you once again let your thoughts wander, this time settling on how Megan came into your life and where her brother approached you.<br />
<br />
Knowing, based on what Megan said, that the fairy woman who wanted to be your sister inserted herself in your life with magick and that she first came to you at your place of work, wherever that was, you figured that her brother must have done the same thing. The only thing was, you had no idea who her brother was and if he did such a thing, he too would have used magick to insert himself into your life.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is getting me nowhere,&quot; you suddenly thought and laying you head on your knees, shifting your arms down a bit so that you were now hugging your shins, you look out at the backyard, a lock of hair falling gently into your line of vision.<br />
<br />
Sitting up, you unlock your fingers, glanced at the wings, wondered how they attached to the costume, immediately knew, and setting them aside, you flop back so that you are lying on the patio and adjusting your feet and legs without giving it a second thought, you stare up at the sky, watching the clouds, wondering what you should decide, weighing both sides of the coin, but unable to come to any sort of conclusion as to whether you take your chance and seek out Megan's brother or become Megan's sister.<br />
<br />
As you lay there, you lace your fingers together and place your hands across your abdomen, while from in the house, specifically the kitchen, you can hear from within the sounds of somebody moving about and figuring it must be Megan, you almost forced myself to get up and move to a different location, but in the end decided it was not worth the effort, plus it might send the wrong message, something you were not in too much of a hurry to do at the moment. Instead, you remained there, hands resting on your abdomen, fingers laced together, one lower leg crossed behind the other, lest anyone see up your dress, unaware of how feminine you looked at that moment, content to let your thoughts drift as you watched the clouds above.<br />
<br />
Sitting up suddenly, you look about and judging by the fading sun, you think that you must have napped at some point. Looking about, you felt hungry and glancing at the house, you wonder about the illusion and whether it extended to the food stored in the cupboards and within the fridge.<br />
<br />
Not really caring, you stand, stretch and picking up the fairy wings, you think over all that has come to the moment you currently at, think over what your two options are and taking a deep breath, you make your decision, figuring you would either tell Megan whenever you saw her next as you glide across the patio, open the screen door and step into the combination dining room and kitchen.<br />
<br />
Making your way toward the kitchen, noting that somebody has already been there recently, and figuring it must have been Megan because of the dishes sitting in the sink, you mentally shrug and head for the refrigerator. Taking out the fixings for a sandwich, you prepare yourself a meal, take a couple juice boxes from the fridge, collect a the bag of crisps from off the counter and head back to the dining room, where you take a seat at the table and begin to eat, all the way, going over in your mind every pro and con you can conceive of that pertains to your choice.<br />
<br />
After you have finished eating, you place your dishes in the sink, next to those already there, and heading toward the bedrooms, you decide to check Megan's first.<br />
<br />
Finding her asleep, still wearing the green fairy costume, you pause as you suddenly think of the wings that go with the dress you are wearing and turning about, you head back to the kitchen to collect them off the counter, where you left them as you were making your sandwich. Heading back to Megan's room, taking deep, even breathes as you do so, keeping you mind focused, you sit down on her bed and reaching out, you began to shake her awake, whispering, &quot;Megan,&quot; as you do so.<br />
<br />
When she was finally awake, and blinking at you in a sleepy manner, you took one final deep breath and looking at her, you tell her, &quot;I've made my choice,&quot; in a serious tone and before she can say anything, you add, &quot;Yes, I'll be your sister.&quot;</p>
