<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casseus grit his teeth, silent seething at Fukushu ascending to leadership. Casseus realized that in terms of magical power, Fukushu bested him. Add Abolith to his side and Casseus realized trying to overthrow Fukushu now would be a fools errand.<br />
<br />
Still, Casseus had his use. Fukushu&#39;s lust for vengeance was his Achilles heel. Sending the liches to destroy Cole and Kumiko when they were trying to persuade the mortal world to their side was a fools errand. Casseus happily pointed this out to Fukushu, who conceded and allowed Casseus to execute a plan.<br />
<br />
The plan itself was simple enough. The couple resided inside the U.S., why not use the government to their advantage. Casseus and Fukushu both wanted revenge against the Harris family. The family, and their in laws the Tozawas, had foiled many of their plans. Additionally the children Mia and Zack were still at the hospital after their run in with Villar. The  future versions of those children had turned back the assault on the hotel, as well as turning Akira and his sister from their side. <br />
<br />
Casseus would now exact his revenge on the entire group. If everything went as planned the U.S. government would apprehend the children after Casseus manufactured false information on them. Once in custody Casseus could dispose of them at his leisure. If they escaped, Casseus could use Isao and the liches to hunt them down. All he needed to do now was wait.<br />
<br />
Kumiko now held her infant daughter Yuriko, a happy but tired expression on her face. Ever since the attack by Villar she had been on bedrest. After waking up from a coma from her head injury she was greeted by her infant daughter Yuriko, cradled in her husbands arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes beautiful,&quot; Kumiko smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So&#39;s her mother,&quot; Cole whispered as he hugged his wife. Kumiko gazed at her husband, noticing the sad look on his face. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Cole?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole didnt want to tell Kumiko about everything that happened after her injuries. Between the death of his father, the battle with Villar, and the appearance of magical creatures around the world, he was simply happy to have his wife back. &quot;Its nothing,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I&#39;m just happy to have you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled, placing a gentle peck on her husbands cheek. As the couple now gazed at Yuriko they didnt notice two 11 year old children wander in. &quot;Oops sorry,&quot; Mia said. &quot;I guess we took a wrong turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko and Cole paused, gazing at the boy and girl in hospital gowns. &quot;Its okay sweety,&quot; Kumiko smiled. &quot;What&#39;s your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Mia,&quot; she said. &quot;And this is Zack. Is that your baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko nodded as the two children now approached. &quot;Shes so cute,&quot; Mia exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And tiny,&quot; Zack added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well shes only a week old,&quot; Kumiko chuckled. &quot;So why are you two here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia and Zack shifted uncomfortably as they remembered what brought them here. &quot;It was a monster,&quot; Zack whispered. &quot;Our friend Gloria fought some monster named Villar but we got hurt really bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two know Gloria and Villar,&quot; Cole exclaimed, causing the two children to shrink back. The children nodded cautiously causing Cole to blink in confusion. &quot;Listem Gloria is a....friend,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;And I know all about Villar. It&#39;s okay we know all about magic and everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Mia and Zack could answer, a knock at the door caught everyone&#39;s attention. Turning the group looked at a man in a dark suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole Harris,&quot; the man said. &quot;I&#39;m Special Agent Alec Dyson, DHS, is your daughter Yuriko Harris?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Cole answered, completely confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; Dyson stated. &quot;I&#39;m sure you are aware of recent events. It appears your daughter is part of the reason for the current crisis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuriko&#39;s a week old,&quot; Cole said. &quot;How the hell can she part of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; Dyson said firmly as two more agents filed in behind him. &quot;While I cannot go into detail it appears a version of your daughter from the future is assisting terrorists in destabilizing the Untied States.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assisting terrorists,&quot; Cole bellowed, his face growing red with anger. &quot;What kind of bullshit is this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; Dyson said curtly, producing a taser from his side. &quot;I cannot begin to explain it. However, in accordance with the president&#39;s executive order, anyone with magical connections to terrorists is to be taken into custody. Regardless of age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko eyes went wide with terror as the two agents now filed past Dyson and advanced on her. Kumiko shrieked, clutching Yuriko to her chest as tears welled in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Cole had seen enough. The former Marine was already at the breaking point. Losing his father and bow possibly losing his newborn daughter, he snapped. Grabbing one of the agents, Cole delivered a thunderous right hook, knocking the man out. As the other agent now advanced Cole grabbed him. Unfortunately the former Marine didn&#39;t notice Dyson as the agent now fired his taser, hitting Cole in the chest.<br />
<br />
Cole spammed, falling to the floor as Dyson delivered a devastating kick to Coles face, knocking him out cold. Snapping his fingers, Kumiko now watched as more agents filed into the room in an attempt to take Yuriko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave them alone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dyson turned as Mia now cast a spell. Dodging out of the way, Dyson watched as his fellow agents were tossed back. &quot;Shes one of them,&quot; Dyson bellowed as he yelled into his radio.<br />
<br />
Mia backpedaled, calling out to Rexie in fear. Shocked that her familiar would not respond she now fearfully watched the agents descend on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave Mia alone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dyson and Mia watched as Zack began to transform. The skinny 11 year old now began to grow, his height rapidly increasing along with his muscles. Dyson watched as dark fur now covered the boys body as his mouth extended into a muzzle of razor sharp teeth. Out of instinct Dyson fired his taser, noticing it had little effect on the massive wolf creature.<br />
<br />
Zack snarled, backhanding Dyson and the other agents and sending them crashing through the wall. Although dazed Dyson had enough sense to call for back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia,&quot; Zack growled as he picked up his frightened friend. &quot;We have to go. Those people want to hurt us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Kumiko called. Zack and Mia paused as they looked at the frightened mother. Kumiko gazed down at her daughter, the infant still asleep despite the noise. She knew that if Yuriko stayed these agents would take her and she had no idea if she would see her again. Sadly, she now pleasingly looked at the two children. &quot;Please take her with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously,&quot; Mia gaped as Kumiko thrust the infant into her arms. &quot;They&#39;ll take her if she stays,&quot; Kumiko cried, tears freely falling. &quot;If shes with you she has a chance. Just please.....keep her safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia and Zack said nothing as they looked at the infant. They had no idea how to take care of an infant. They did realize though that the three of them would be arrested if they stayed. Mia now clutched the baby close as Zack now picked up Mia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise we&#39;ll take care of her,&quot; Mia said firmly.<br />
<br />
Already the group could hear more agents rushing towards the room. Zack now turned towards the window, smashing the glass as he kept out the window. As the agents rushed in they now fired their weapons in a vain attempt to stop the trio. Kumiko could only cry silently as Zack and Mia vanished with her daughter. No matter what happened to her and Cole she could only pray that the kids would be safe.</p>
