<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: This is a spin-off of the Desert Foxes story.<br />
<br />
Jen was sitting in her room working on her homework. It has been three weeks since she was transformed by the Kitsune Akira. It had been a little challenging learning how to walk with a digigrade stance but she was able to. Many of her friends had thought that she had been lying when she had told them that she wasn't a mystical in disguise. She could see why they would have thought that since she suddenly became a fox girl. She had tried to explain that this was a gift from Akira but they didn't listen. Those friends drifted away from her while the ones that did believe her became closer friends. She looked at the snake that was her familiar. That was another reason that her supposed friends drew away. Snakes were associated with evil even in this day and age by some.<br />
<br />
She thought back to when Slifer had come to her. It had been just three days after she was transformed. A couple of kids had put him in a box and thrown him into a pond. She couldn't stand them treating an animal like that and had dove into the pond. She found the box at the bottom in a shallow area and brought it back up. Once she opened the lid he came out and thanked her. She had been taken aback that a snake was speaking to her momentarily but she quickly got over it and said that he was welcome. He had told her his name and offered his services to her for saving him. Since then they have been pretty much inseparable.<br />
<br />
She was jolted back to the present when her mom came into her room with an older girl in tow. Charlene looked at her daughter and said &quot;I want you to meet someone. Jen, this is Allison. Allison, this is my daughter Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jen&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison is your cousin&quot; Charlene said. &quot;She's from America. Her mother was my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought my cousin in America was Rick and he was an adult&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was&quot; Allison said. &quot;When the mystical world was revealed someone placed a curse on me transforming me into what you see now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to your mum and dad?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were killed in a car accident&quot; Allison said. &quot;I'm twelve now and a minor again. Sine you're my only other family the courts decided that I should come live with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alison will be sharing your room&quot; Charlene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great Mum&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for taking me in Aunt Charlene&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll leave you two girls alone so you can get to know each other&quot; Charlene said.<br />
<br />
Once Charlene had left Allison brought in two suitcases. She looked around and said &quot;This is a nice room. I see you have a pet snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not a pet&quot; Slifer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mistake&quot; Allison said bowing a bit. &quot;I humbly apologize for the insult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smart girl&quot; Slifer said. &quot;I accept you're apology.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly a parrot appeared in the room and went after Slifer. Allison sternly said &quot;Arcturo! Leave that snake alone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Arcturo veered off and landed on a perch that had appeared out of nowhere. &quot;I was just going to have a little fun&quot; Arcturo said. &quot;I wasn't going to harm it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad that you didn't mean me any harm&quot; Slifer said. &quot;Allow me to introduce myself. I am Slifer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another familiar&quot; Arcturo said. &quot;This is an interesting turn of events.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a magical girl too?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
Allison smiled and said &quot;Yes I am. I'm guessing that you're one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Jen said. &quot;This is great. I'm not alone being a magical girl around here anymore. I'll show you what I look like if you show me what you look like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Allison said. &quot;I'll go first.&quot; She brought out what looked like half of a fossilized birds head and said &quot;Mystic Power Activate!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fossil glowed and vanished as the glow surrounded Allison. Her clothes disappeared and she was completely nude for a brief moment. What looked to be a yellow one piece swimsuit appeared on her followed by yellow knee high boots and yellow elbow length gloves. Her hair turned from a medium brown to platinum blond. Her olive eyes changed to ice blue. A pair of wings with brilliant white feathers grew from her back and a white panther tail grew out from above her butt. The transformation was finished now and she smiled and said &quot;Your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded and taking her necklace said &quot;Mystic Girl Power!&quot; The necklace glowed and spread to the rest of her body. Her feet shrunk down to human feet. Her face shrank back in on itself to become a human face. The fur on her body receded into her body. Her jeans and shirt fused together and became pink. Her jeans shortened until the whole thing looked like some type of one piece swimsuit. A pink skirt grew from around her hips and pink knee high boots and pink elbow length gloves formed. Finally a third tail grew. She looked at Allison and asked &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look cute&quot; Allison said with all honesty. &quot;Of course you looked cute before too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Jen said and her fox ears twitched. &quot;Mum's coming back up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should change back then&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have to do that&quot; Jen said. &quot;Mum knows that I'm a magical girl and she should know that you're one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Allison could reply to that Charlene came in and asked &quot;What are you two girls up to? Oh! I see what you're up to now. Jen, you know I don't want you transforming into your magical girl form without reason. And who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me Aunt Charlene&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison?&quot; Charlene asked. &quot;You look different but still the same. I take it you're a magical girl too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I am&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want you transforming without reason either&quot; Charlene said. &quot;I'm your guardian now and you'll listen to me. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Aunt Charlene&quot; Allison said. &quot;What about training though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot; Charlene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll need to train to make sure we can fight if need be&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want you two fighting&quot; Charlene said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may have to at times&quot; Allison said. &quot;We won't go looking for a fight. We promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like the idea of you two fighting&quot; Charlene said. &quot;Though I guess I can't keep you from fighting to protect people. Just be careful and don't go looking for fights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We promise Mum&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Charlene said. &quot;Supper will be ready in a bit. I want you to get your homework done.&quot; She said this last glaring at Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mum&quot; Jen said and went back to her homework.<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect you to do your work when you go to school&quot; Charlene said glaring at Allison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Aunt Charlene&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
After Charlene left Jen said &quot;I want to make my friends into magical girls too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will you do that?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My necklace can transform my friends into magical girls too&quot; Jen explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you going to transform into a magical girl?&quot; Allison asked.</p>
