<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay,&quot; you decide, &quot;I will join you. But you must promise to keep your word. <br />
We won't kill people and we won't force this upon them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise, so long as I shall live I will harm no other creature for my own gain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; you are satisfied he will keep his word. &quot;But before you change me, I <br />
think some introductions are in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then, my name is Xaczik. But as that may be hard for you to say, <br />
perhaps you could call me Xac [like Zack].&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, Xac, I'm Jason. So do you have to bite me to change me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, as long as I can get some of my body inside of you, you will change. So <br />
probably the most painless way would be...&quot;<br />
<br />
He suddenly pulled you close to him and kissed you. You were surprised at <br />
first, but he held you still and thrust his tongue into your mouth. It was long like <br />
a wolf's tongue and went all the way to the back of your throat where you felt <br />
the latex slide down and enter your body. Once Xac had pumped a good pint of <br />
latex into you, he retreated his tongue and broke the kiss. A string of purple <br />
liquid latex hung between your lips for a moment before he slurped it back up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Was that so bad?<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you admitted, &quot;It was, actually, kind of...nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I put a lot into you,&quot; Xac said, &quot;So your change should be quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough, your body erupted with spots of latex forming everywhere and <br />
quickly merging to coat your entire form in the purple substance. The latex <br />
changed your body. Your legs became digit-grade while your feet became <br />
paws. Your hands stayed relatively human, but with pads and claws. Your head <br />
became that of a wolf with pointed ears, a muzzle and wet nose. It also bilked <br />
up your frame so that you were big and muscular like Xac. Your arms alone <br />
were a full six inches of raw muscle. Your barely visible four pack quickly <br />
became a defined eight pack. A tail appeared above your ass and your whole <br />
body was covered with purple latex fur. the last thing to change was that your <br />
balls grew to the size of large grapefruits and were engulfed in your furry sack. <br />
Your cock grew back it's sheath which was also covered in fur before growing <br />
to a flaccid length of twelve inches and a width of six. You hadn't noticed it <br />
before, but you saw now that Xac was equally endowed. <br />
<br />
When your transformation stopped you were a complete replica of Xac and a <br />
perfect purple latex werewolf. Every movement you made was euphoric and the <br />
slight breeze that blew through your rubber fur was almost orgasmic. It took you <br />
a few moments to adjust to the perpetual ecstasy that was your new body. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you enjoy the difference,&quot; Xac said. He approached you and elastically <br />
wound himself around your body. The touch of latex against latex sent your <br />
mind over the edge as you were consumed with immense pleasure. Though it <br />
would have been an odd sight: one muscular, hung, purple latex werewolf <br />
standing in the middle of a park going into orgasmic shudders with another <br />
creature just like him impossibly wrapped around his body. <br />
<br />
Xac's own equipment rubbed up against yours and his mouth was next to your <br />
ear. He whispered in it sending shivers down your body as he spoke, no longer <br />
frightening, but feral in a seductive way. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's all yours now. We are brothers, twins, and more. We are one in heart and <br />
mind. Let us mate, we will create more of us without the help of these inferior <br />
humans. All we need is each other. Let our minds and bodies become one as <br />
we mate. Take me now, make me yours. You feel the pleasure welling up <br />
inside of you. We are superior. We are the ultimate life forms. We will rule. Take <br />
me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The remnants of your human mind told you this wasn't right. They told you you <br />
hadn't been gay, you weren't gay, should never be gay. But the ecstasy of <br />
Xac's touch, his hot breath in your ear and his hot crotch against yours were <br />
overwhelming. It felt so right, how could it be wrong? You heard the truth in his <br />
words. This pleasure was yours. It was his. You had made it for each other. You <br />
had never felt this good before, by yourself or with a woman. And you knew <br />
your previous size hadn't made her feel this way. This was true euphoria. This <br />
was everything you could ask for in a mate. Except...<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; you pant your question to Xac.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can wrap myself around you, do you think I can't make an opening big <br />
enough for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He unwrapped himself from your body and dragged you on top of him. He <br />
wrapped his legs around your waist and pulled your crotch to his rump. With no <br />
lubrication whatsoever, you prodded his opening with your fourteen inch erect <br />
dick. It easily fit around your length, but was tighter than any pussy you had <br />
fucked before. Xac moaned in pleasure as you thrust yourself deep inside of <br />
him, impossibly deep as even your balls were sucked in. It was the most <br />
amazing feeling ever!<br />
<br />
As you thrust yourself repeatedly inside your new partner, his own equipment <br />
was staring you in the face. To your new mind, it was irresistible. You leaned <br />
down in a backbreaking bend like the rubber you were and took his entire <br />
length into your mouth. You sucked the whole thick cock, licking inside of the <br />
head and rubbing his balls with a hand not bracing yourself against him. The <br />
pleasure continued to mount until you felt about to pass out, but still you had <br />
not come. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have any organs now,&quot; Xac panted between moans of ecstasy, &quot;You <br />
don't make semen, you produce our life substance now. You will come when <br />
you will yourself to. Our bodies are hollow, fill me with your essence.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had no trouble in complying. You imagined the pleasure growing to an <br />
unbearable level, and it did, and finally releasing all of your seed into Xac's <br />
body. Like a torrent, the substance rushed from your cock into your mate's ass. <br />
It lasted for minutes, pumping his body full of your wonderful, hot latex cum. He <br />
was filled to the brim with your essence until his stomach was engorged so <br />
much that he looked pregnant. <br />
<br />
At the same instant, Xac released his seed into your mouth. You tried to <br />
swallow, but the force was too strong for your mouth and you pulled off of his <br />
cock, his purple seed covering you both in hot, sticky liquid. You licked <br />
whatever cum you could from both of your bodies while Xac absorbed the spilt <br />
seed back into himself. You slowly pulled out as your orgasm ended and <br />
helped Xac to his feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you absorb that?&quot; you ask him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm going to use your seed to make our offspring. I will transform <br />
myself into a when they are fully formed so that we may start a new colony here <br />
on Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the humans will never except us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They will not have a choice, how can they stop us if we decide to stay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that they can stop us, it's that they will try. They'll end up hurting <br />
themselves trying to get rid of us. Why don't we recruit whatever humans we <br />
need, then leave. Do you still have your space station.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I had to conceal it in the north woods of Canada. It will take us <br />
months to travel that far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that is the price of starting a colony unmolested, then it is worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right,&quot; Xac conceded, &quot;But before we leave we must find more to <br />
recruit. Why don't you find people who will be able to handle our gift. I will find a <br />
place to rest until our children are born. Try to find some women so I don't have <br />
to give birth every time we have sex. But find some males as well. Make sure <br />
they are strong of mind, but will listen to our commands. And don't give them as <br />
much as I gave you. Give them about an ounce of your essence so that they <br />
will be submissive. Good luck!&quot;</p>
