<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen arrived to  his lit class taught by Prof. Scott. <br />
<br />
Prof. Scott was gorgeous. And I mean model-like in his beauty. Slender and tall, short dark hair, cute glasses, about 25 years old, wearing dark brown trousers, a button-up shirt and a tie, a real bookish charm about him. He stood up at the front of the class, and began the lesson.<br />
<br />
“Today class, we’re going to be reviewing Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.” <br />
Most of the class ignored him. It was a freshman literature class a prerequisite that only English majors looked forward to. Many phones were out and people weren’t paying attention but Stephen was typing furiously. <br />
<br />
Prof. Scott loosened his tie. “Since you all should have read the ending by now, who wants to tell me why Portia had to dress up as a man?” He kicked his shoes off. “Yes, Emily?” He shucked his tie.<br />
“Women weren’t allowed to be lawyers in those days”, came the reply. Emily was a short girl with short blonde hair. She sat in the third row of the auditorium next to the only person who seemed to be typing. <br />
<br />
She looked over at the annoying guy.  Can you keep it down?” She asked him.  “The young man looked at her and whispered can you suck a dick?”<br />
<br />
He typed away and then clicked and all of a sudden she was bending down over what looked to be a ten inch dick.  Slurping and gobbling at like it was her favorite thing in the world. <br />
<br />
Professor Scott continued, “Why weren’t they?” He’d unbuttoned the top two buttons on his shirt, and was moving onto the third.<br />
“’Coz women are stupid?” came a reply from a guy named Josh in the second row. He wore a smirk as he said it; a real wise-guy. <br />
<br />
“Well, they were treated as inferiors in general.” He’d finished unbuttoning his shirt revealing a hairless cobbled core. “But in particular for roles of responsibility. Now, what was her resolution to Shylock’s demands? Emily?” He’d removed his shirt and chucked it on the floor. He had perfect pecs and abs.<br />
<br />
The girl looked up from the dick she had been sucking. She just shrugged.<br />
<br />
The teacher sighed. “You’ll put your brains to good use one day, I’m sure...” He had unbuttoned his trousers. <br />
<br />
 Emily  never put her brains to good use... Now, she was drastically pregnant and struggling over her massive belly to get at another freshman’s cock. and she looked nine months pregnant. She removed her top.<br />
<br />
“Anyone else?” Prof. Scot paused with his thumbs in his trousers, waiting for an answer before he pulled them off.<br />
“He couldn’t take the flesh without removing blood, which wasn’t part of the deal, and he’d be executed if he tried” said a skinny, black-haired guy at the far left of the classroom. He was staring at Mr Scott’s crotch, waiting. <br />
<br />
“Excellent, well done” said Mr Scott, and slipped his trousers off. He had perfect legs... And a gorgeous butt. He was wearing navy blue boxer-briefs. His package looked reasonably sized—probably about 4 inches soft was my guess. But it was quickly expanding. Growing to fill the maximum capacity of those navy blue boxer-briefs. <br />
<br />
His cock was getting so big! The bulge was monstrous, and pulled the underwear down so his trimmed pubes were visible. The strap didn’t even reach his skin anymore. And it swayed and jiggled as he walked, and lectured. It was almost hypnotic. <br />
<br />
“Let’s move on. Today we are just surveying the different stories that were assigned for the year.  Who has started with Lord of the Flies?” Professor Scott queried, putting his thumbs into his waistband.<br />
<br />
“Who can tell me what Piggy signifies?” he continued as he slipped his underwear off. The sight of  his cock caused a small gasp from everyone who wasn’t on their phone.  It was As thicker than his wrist, it hung almost halfway down his thighs, with balls to match. It swung as he walked, so gorgeous... And his ass!  There never was a more perfect one. <br />
<br />
“Civilisation?” said a said a fat girl who was eating candy nude in the front row, squeezing her nipples as someone knelt between her legs and gave her a tongue job. <br />
<br />
“Exactly!” said Professor Scott, reaching into his desk. “Now, who can tell me the context of the book?” He pulled out a very large blue dildo.<br />
<br />
Mr Scott smiled, put the dildo upright on his desk and slowly lowered himself onto it. He groaned in pleasure and his massive cock bounced around, becoming hard. As he raised himself and lowered himself again and again, groaning in pleasure, he waited for a response. The blonde boy with a girl sucking his dick in the third row raised his hand and said, “I think it was a post modern rejection of the white savior mentality that dominated previously written ‘jungle adventure’ media such as the writings of Rudyard Kipling. Or whatever gets you off.”<br />
<br />
Professor Scott came in volumes coating most of the people in the third row. He stood up and wiped his dick off with his lecture notes. <br />
<br />
“Good work class. Let’s get back at this next class period.” Class dismissed. <br />
<br />
The annoying blond guy came into the pregnant Emily’s mouth and she got her things an left with her belly protruding in front of her.  Her nipples leaked as she slowly took each step.  <br />
<br />
Professor Scott’s discarded clothing had vanished. He opened his briefcase and pulled out a pair of flip flops and a T-shirt. He threw on the tight shirt that said, “Reading is Lit”  and then fished out  a seethrough mesh thong and stretched it to its absolute limit. He cheerfully tossed the blue dildo into the case and made his way to his next responsibility.  <br />
<br />
Stephen got up and left the classroom.</p>
