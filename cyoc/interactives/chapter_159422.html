<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So, Jen sat back down in her chair in the lounge area surrounding the bar. All that muscle growth had worn her out, and now that her muscles had shrunk back down, she was feeling rather tired. She just leaned back in her comfortable chair and quietly dozed off for ten minutes until a nice, young man sat down in the chair next to her. <br />
<br />
The young man just wore a button shirt with slacks under his tank top since he had his gym bag with him. He was planning on going to the gym next door for a workout in a few minutes anyway. He just stopped for a cold glass of iced tea. He sat quietly next to Jen, reading messages on his phone when Jen woke up. <br />
<br />
“Ohh… Hi…” she sighed, taking note of the young guy next to her. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry. I hope I didn’t wake you up. Can I get you something to drink?” the friendly guy offered her. <br />
<br />
“Um… Just some tea, thanks” <br />
<br />
The young guy stood up and walked over to the bar and returned with a cup of tea. <br />
<br />
“Here ya go! I’m Justin, by the way!” he smiled. <br />
<br />
“Oh, hi. I’m Jen! Pleased to meet you.” <br />
<br />
She started to like the young guy. He seemed shy and friendly. He also looked fairly muscular, but it was hard to tell because he was wearing all those clothes. <br />
<br />
“So, are you a student around here?” he asked her. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m still in high school! What about you?” <br />
<br />
“I just graduated. I’m starting college in the fall. I’m about to have my workout in the gym next door. I’m gonna get changed over here because I don’t like to change in the locker room. It’s so dirty all the time!” he grumbled. <br />
<br />
He walked off and returned from the men’s room, wearing just shorts, a tank top and his tennis shoes. He was very muscular! The young guy was short with bulging pecs, thick arms and with legs which were as wide as tree trunks!<br />
<br />
“Wow, Justin! You’re pretty buff!” Jen smiled. She always had a thing for muscle guys. <br />
<br />
“Aww, thanks! You wanna go to the gym with me?” he offered her. <br />
<br />
“Sure!”<br />
<br />
They both finished their tea. Then, he paid the bill and they left the bar, so they just walked to the large gym, located right next door. <br />
<br />
Once inside, she sat down by one of the small tables in the lounge area, close to the strength machines and the cardio section of the gym. <br />
<br />
“Oh, this place is nice!” Jen grinned, while looking around!<br />
<br />
Then, three other young, muscular men wearing tank tops and shorts walked up to Justin right before he introduced them to Jen. All three of them were over 6 feet tall and all three weighed over 300 pounds of pure, raw, unbridled muscle! Justin was actually the shortest and the smallest guy in the group. <br />
<br />
“Jen, these are my dudes… These are Isaac, Julian, and Kyle… My gym buddies!” Justin grinned, introducing the three big, muscular men to Jen. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Ohh, wow!” Jen grinned, standing up to say hi to these three, tall muscle hunks.<br />
<br />
Jen was all thrilled and excited to meet these four, big, hunky guys when all of the sudden she was overcome by this weird, intense tingling sensation again. This feeling struck her in every muscle in her short, 5-foot-6-inch frame. <br />
<br />
“Oh, crap! No! Not again!” she groaned. <br />
<br />
She felt it coming. It was about to hit her. The curse. It was coming hard. It was going to hit her again. It was coming VERY HARD this time. <br />
<br />
“UUUUHHHHHHHHH!!!” Jen growled as she closed her eyes and cringed.<br />
<br />
Every muscle in her body suddenly tensed up. <br />
<br />
The four men curiously stepped closer to Jen, just to see if she was okay. Then, they quickly backed off, when they noticed how her body began to expand rapidly, forcing her to burst out of her clothes. <br />
<br />
“Jen? What’s happening? JEN?” Justin wondered out loud. <br />
<br />
Jen’s chest suddenly barreled out from her top and her jacket, bursting free under the extreme pressure. Her arms inflated rapidly, growing muscle at an alarming rate. Her breasts ballooned from her chest like they were being filled with helium at an alarming rate. As they expanded, her chest bulged and her shoulders widened dramatically, growing to three times as wide as before. Big, bulging lumps of muscle formed all around her chest and breasts, making her ridiculously wide and large up on top. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” one of the men gasped, as they looked on in complete shock. <br />
<br />
Her mid-section widened and filled out with the biggest and most well-defined abdominal muscles ever spotted in the gym. She didn’t have a six-pack or an eight-pack but a twenty-four-pack or cobblestone ridges side-by-side on her vast, expansive, ripped torso. Her body was just getting bigger, deeper and wider, and becoming so large that it made her look superhuman in every regard. <br />
<br />
Her legs just filled out with muscle, growing wider and thicker and deeper with every passing second. Her quads just exploded with muscle, inflating to over four feet wide on every leg, exploding with mighty cords of muscle so big, that she would have a hard time standing straight on those big, heavy legs. Her calves inflated to the size of large beach balls, fully covered in long, thick veins, which carried gallons of blood everywhere throughout her expanding body. <br />
<br />
“Ohhhh…. Ohh…. UHHHHHHH!!” Jen groaned loudly as all this muscle growth was making her bigger, wider and taller, all at once. Her arms were bulging with an insane amount of muscle, as they continued to expand at such a dramatic rate, that she could no longer hold her arms straight down and against her large body. Her super-thick arms were now hanging from her ultra-wide shoulders at an angle, just because the combination of her giant biceps and triceps had made her python arms bigger than sewer pipes. Her back, her shoulder blades, her traps and delts were completely engulfed in big, thick, large lumps of solid muscle everywhere as her massive arms complimented the rest of her massive, gigantic, super-muscular frame. <br />
<br />
Jen was rapidly transforming from a female bodybuilder into a muscle queen, and then to a muscle Goddess, all within a matter of minutes, while she was standing among four muscle men who were quickly being outgrown. <br />
<br />
“Ohmygosh! She’s HUGE!” Isaac gasped. “She is a beast!” <br />
<br />
“Holy shit! How did she get so enormous?” Kyle asked. <br />
<br />
Finally, when they incredible growth spurt ended, the four men were left feeling very uncomfortable and intimidated by Jen, who suddenly became the largest and the most muscular being in the entire gym. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Alright, you guys… Guess I’m the biggest one here!” Jen smiled, raising up her gigantic right arm, causing a massive ball of muscle to swell up on her arm that was even bigger than the largest medicine ball in the gym. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… I better get back to my workout…” Kyle said, quickly walking away. <br />
<br />
“Me too” Isaac added. <br />
<br />
“I need to get back to my bench press…” Julian said, before walking off. <br />
<br />
That left Justin all alone with Jen, who was now close to 8 feet tall and who weighed close to 600 pounds of raw muscle while Justin himself was only 5-foot-8 with about 190 pounds. What was he going to do with Jen, who was much bigger than him?</p>
