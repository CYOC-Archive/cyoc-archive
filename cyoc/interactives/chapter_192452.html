<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He started walking through the carnival awkwardly walking on his hooves amongst the people while getting stared at by curious people.<br />
As he was doing this he reguraly heard people say.<br />
That animal was a human....<br />
Did you see that?<br />
Look, hes an animal now.<br />
He wasn&#39;t bothered by this and on the contrary he was enjoying the attention. His new hooved members were bringing him all the attention that he wanted.<br />
On one occasion he stopped in front of a farm hand while he said.<br />
I have a few animals like you in my barn that make due with having hooves, but I&#39;ve never seen a human want a pair of them to live with.<br />
He had been practicing his speach and he managed to say: They are much better than you think,and as madame Illusia said after a few days of living with them you don&#39;t feel a need to have hands anymore. You just adapt.<br />
Unbeknownst to him the man would later undergo the same process as him and end up with the hooves of a bull. Effectively experiencing the same blissful limitations of not having to worry about anything rather than your legs. <br />
He even spoke with a teenager who was interested in horses as he had been and found out that he wanted the same thing. <br />
He talked him through it and even raised his hooves up for him to check out. <br />
You must really have fun with these he said,while holding his left hoof where his hand had been. <br />
Do you ever feel your hands or fingers anymore through these? <br />
In the first part I thought I did, having vague feelings, however my brain has been slowly rewiring and now I don&#39;t feel anything anymore besides vague differences in the ground I walk.<br />
As he finished he placed his hoof down and thanked him saying that hell become a stallion like him. <br />
Be careful kid, a pair of these lasts a lifetime,make sure this is what you want before you go ahead and seal your hands forever. <br />
I am, nobody has any expectations of you that they would any other horse when you have hooves at the end of your hands and legs. <br />
Right that evening the boy went to madame illusia and his hands and legs were changed to hooves making him walk on his 4 legs for the rest of his life. He was amongst the lucky ones as he kept his sex and became a stallion. (1 in 10) While the rest weren&#39;t so lucky being given a hand job from madame Illusia that was to be their last. Those that didn&#39;t keep their sex were lined up along side girls that were turned into horses and kept their sex. <br />
All of these mares were mounted that night by the stallion mentioned previously and a girl who was turned into a stallion,(something she was beginning to enjoy) <br />
4 mares were mounted that night and 3 of them ended up with a foal stirring up in their belly. Coincidentally all of these 3 were newly turned horses that used to be the opposite sex the night before. However they ended up on all fours and they got what they wanted(hooves) however due to the reality bending properties some of them would have been born as mares if they were born an animal in the first place. That doesn&#39;t matter now since the reality in which they were  is now ours. <br />
Madame even nailed the hooves of some of the participants that were more excited than usual to lose their hands in favor of hooves. So that by some miracle if she would change her mind about whether she should turn them back or not, she wouldn&#39;t go through the effort of taking the horse shoes off, effectively sealing their fate for the rest of their lives. <br />
While she was doing several participants started cuming profusely after each hammer strike, each subsequent hit bringing them closer to a life on all fours that was to last until the day they were dead. <br />
She just couldn&#39;t believe just how much some of these participants came and not just once several times. One of them came 4 times for each one of his hooves being nailed and secured in place. <br />
Another one came only once while madame was working on his front hooves however his misfortune was that it coated madame shoes in a thick layer of it and she got mad while saying. <br />
If you do that again while I nail your hooves I&#39;m going to make sure you never do it again. As she was doing this she purposely hit his hooves on the floor to feel the new metal horse shoe attached to them. This drove him insane however he held on until she was done and only came the second time when he looked at his front legs having horse shoes on them effectively sealing his fate and view for the rest of his life. <br />
When she was done she saw that he was holding on and amplified his sensations of still having hands he could move this driving him over the edge as he knew they weren&#39;t there anymore and that they will never be there again. <br />
At the end of the show madame turned about 20 horses, 2 stallions and 18 mares.<br />
And wandered what animal will be in high demand next...</p>
