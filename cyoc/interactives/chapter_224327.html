<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Simon, his classmate in Art History. While he may have a scholarship to attend classes due to his art, Simon was still peddling his works on the campus grounds to make ends meet. His body showed that he had even been skipping meals to keep up, with his body becoming lankier week after week every time Drake had a class with him. Couple with his above-average height of 6&#39;3&quot; and his thining body, he could be considered to be a human stick bug that can paint.<br />
<br />
When Drake bumps into Simon, Simon is carrying his suitcase of unsold artwork of the day and is making his way home. &quot;Woah, Simon! Are you okay?&quot; Drake made his attempt to comfort Simon after he accidentally bumped into his classmate, sending Simon&#39;s artwork flying out into the autumn breeze. Simon sighed and looked forlorn at one of his paintings flying off into a tree. &quot;I don&#39;t know Drake. I&#39;ve been trying to save up some money for a while now, but I can&#39;t seem to sell a single artwork.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you tried selling online? Or even streaming yourself painting? I know that you are talented so it should be easy for you.&quot; Drake pointed out some points for Simon while he helped with the gathering of the paintings. Drake looked at the painting that he picked up from the ground. It was supposed to be a painting of a dragon on a mountaintop, with its wing spread out and a plume of fire bellowing from its maw. But due to how wet it has been lately, it looks more like a snake emerging from a fog. Somewhat cool looking, but not as cool as a dragon.<br />
&quot;I have tried that before, both the online selling and the streaming,&quot; Simon was climbing the tree to get the final art. &quot;But I don&#39;t have the following or the popularity as the other artists online. So, in comparison to everyone else, I&#39;m a nobody.&quot; Simon managed to grab the paper from the branches, which led him to lose his grip on the tree and so he fell down. The painting (which was a forest which Drake thought it was ironic since it was stuck in a tree) made the fall, but Simon&#39;s ego and his sprained wrist didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK!&quot; cried out Simon, seeing how messed up his wrist is. &quot;Great, just great. And now my wrist is fucked up.&quot; Simon gingerly held his busted arm and went up to Drake to get the rest of his paintings. &quot;I know that you were helping and I appreciate it, really I do. But unless you happen to have something that can make me more popular to make money, I&#39;m all ears.&quot; At that, Simon wobbled his way to his dorm building and went inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, it&#39;s tough to see such a great artist get so low. Not to mention his busted wing as well.&quot; Drake reaches back into his backpack and grabs Beldazarr&#39;s lamp. After a quick rubbing and a puff of smoke, Drake got the wish-granting Djinn out. &quot;Hello again, my master. What would you like to wish for now?&quot; Beldazarr bowed deeply, awaiting for Drake&#39;s wish. &quot;Beldazarr, you saw Simon and his woe, right?&quot; &quot;I saw the artist and his great fall. Do you want me to heal him, my lord?&quot; <br />
&quot;The arm isn&#39;t that important. What I want for my next wish is that Simon is no longer a starving artist and in fact one of the best streamers in the world.&quot; Beldazarr thought deeply about the wish, knowing how little it contained what he could control with his magic. &quot;Master, that wish is a little too vague for me to make it come true. Could you rephrase it into something that is in my realm of the mind and bodies?&quot; Drake forgot that the djinn probably doesn&#39;t know about streaming and being on the internet. So Drake came up with another wish, one that the wish granter can grant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Beldazarr, not only I would wish for his arm to recover, but for Simon to have a body that makes him the center of attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing a much better wish than the last one, Beldazarr said, &quot;It is done,&quot; with a snap of his finger and he disappeared in a poof of smoke. Curious to see how the wish worked, Drake made his way to Simon&#39;s dorm. By the time he made it inside, Drake saw Simon lying on the couch. Simon was still resting his arm with an ice pack with a morose look on his face. Drake went to a plush chair and sat down, waiting to see how his wish made Simon better.<br />
<br />
As for Simon, he was thinking about how much harder it would be to paint without the full use of his hand. &quot;What the point,&quot; Simon argued under his breath. &quot;Unless I&#39;m one of those &quot;girls&quot; that got a following because of their bra size, I have no chance to get anywhere.&quot; At that point, Simon can feel some movements back in his wrist. While it may have been Beldazarr&#39;s power that healed Simon&#39;s arm, Simon thinks that it was the ice pack. <br />
&quot;Heh, all I needed was some ice and I feel better than ever. In fact, I feel like painting some more.&quot; So Simon gathered his things and rapidly went back outside. Drake quickly went after him, to see his handiwork in person. After a short walk across the green, Simon&#39;s body and clothes begin to change without him noticing it. At first, it was Simon&#39;s height shrinking down with his clothes matching up so that they still fit. Then the next important effect was his clothes gaining a much lighter tone from their drab original color to a more brilliant shade of reds and oranges.<br />
<br />
Then, the strangest thing that shocked Drake about how Simon&#39;s transformation, was how feminine he was getting. Sure, he already has long hair coupled with the fact of his inability to grow facial hair, but his shrinking height and the loud clothes really made him look like a girl. Drake sped up his walking in order to see how feminine Simon got. Sure enough, the closer Drake gets, the more Simon becomes more like a girl.<br />
By the time Drake made it up to the girl that was Simon, she looked like a knockout. Where Simon has stringy, mattered brown hair, this girl happens to be a brunette that has volume and bounce to her wavy hair. The unflattering clothes that Simon wore from the thrift store have been replaced with clothes that showed off the girl&#39;s curves. Speaking of curves, it seems that in order for Simon to be the &quot;center of attention&quot;, Beldazarr gave the girl a giant rack and some wide hips. <br />
Even her clothes were adjusted to present rather than hide her bootylicious figure. Her cleavage bulged out of their boob window with her bra giving her a quad-boob look to them while her low-ride pants cling on to her much bigger ass and hips. If Drake hadn&#39;t seen Simon transforming into a streamer girl, he would&#39;ve thought that she was new here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Simone, do you need help with your Art History homework?&quot; Drake quickly asked the influencer, realizing that like his name, Simon&#39;s name had changed as well. &quot;No thanks, Drakey. I&#39;m good for now. Which is perfect because I&#39;m going to paint on my stream later today,&quot; Simone replied in a much more bubblier and higher-pitch way of speaking. Simone sighed into her bouncing tits from her walking. &quot;It&#39;s not easy trying to entertain over 690,000 followers every day. But I have to make sure that everyone has the chance to be colorful in their own ways. Anyway, catch you on the bright side, see ya.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once Simone bounced away, Drake felt good about what he had done. Sure, he transformed his struggling artist classmate into a bustling artist streamer, but at the very least Drake has done a good deed today. Now what to do next with his wishes?</p>
