<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan pushed himself off the bed, striking a few more poses for himself in the mirror with a dumb grin plastered on his face. Going to a bar or getting drunk seemed a fun enough idea, but doing so alone didn&#39;t seem that appealing. He picked up the scrapped remains of his pants and dug inside until he found his phone. He tried to think of who might be able to come over. Mike being the last friend he saw meant the first to be texted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, wanna come over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were gonna just slack off tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was. Got bored. I got a surprise, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, give me a few.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike lived a few houses down, so it gave Dylan some time to get everything set up. He went into his room and grabbed his web cam with a grin. This was going to get recorded this time. Heading downstairs and regardless of the fact he was naked, Dylan strode into the kitchen. He set out a plate with one of the pills on it along with a glass of water. He found a spot where his webcam would have a good view of the kitchen. Then he rushed back up stairs to his room, shut the door, and made sure his camera set up was working.<br />
<br />
Just in time, the doorbell rang. &quot;Sorry, getting changed.&quot; He texted. &quot;Door&#39;s open.&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard the door open and close, and Mike shout from downstairs. &quot;Hey, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
He picked up his phone. &quot;Surprise is in the kitchen.&quot; He turned his eyes to his computer screen and saw Mike come into the kitchen. Mike was taller than Dylan had been, though he was sure he would tower over the teen now. He was also one of those guys that could eat anything and stay lean. His blond hair was cut short into a buzzcut, which he liked because he didn&#39;t have to do anything with it. Mike looked around and spotted the plate, then started tapping on his phone.<br />
<br />
Dylan&#39;s phone pinged with a new message. &quot;What? This pill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take it, trust me..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not taking some random pill!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not random, it&#39;s good stuff. Trust me, I already took one. I&#39;ll be down in a sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stared at the pill for a bit, then picked it up and looked it over. Dylan could try to nudge him to take it, as that would tip his hand that he was watching. Eventually his friend shrugged, popped the pill and washed it down.<br />
<br />
The changes seemed to happen faster in Mike than they did in Dylan, but maybe that was just because he was suddenly watching from the outside. Mike gripped the edge of the counter as he suddenly looked dizzy. It simultaneously looked like he was growing and his clothes were shrinking.<br />
<br />
Dylan found himself chubbing up at the sight and grabbed his cock in his hand, stroking it slowly as he watched his friend aging. Mike was staring dumbfounded at his hands as the grew larger. He rubbed his eyes with his palms as if trying to clear his vision then blinked a few times and kept staring at his hands. He gripped the edge of the counter again as he seemed to loose his balance, but started trying to quickly pry off his shoes, freeing up growing feet that were suddenly crammed in too small sneakers. One busted open before he could completely get it off.<br />
<br />
He grabbed at his shirt and tore it off, chest heaving as he took in deep breaths, one of his hands holding on to the counter as the other ran over his newly muscled torso, tracing lean pecs and a taught four-pack stomach. Dylan could even see hairs sprouting on his friend&#39;s chin and lip, side burns growing out and spreading along his cheeks. Mike&#39;s shorts were still fitting, but they now ended a few inches above his knee, his legs having grown a fine blond fuzz all over them in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
He reached out and grabbed his phone, struggling with his suddenly too big hands to type out a text. &quot;What&#39;s happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s supposed to.&quot; Dylan typed back. &quot;Just enjoy it.&quot; He certainly was, as his friend left his teens behind and entered what looked like his twenties he started pumping his cock with a little more vigor. Mike was filling out more, and while he didn&#39;t seem to be bulking up as much as Dylan had, he was still sporting a rather impressive physique, his pecs filling out more as his stomach hardened into a six-pack. He beard filled in completely, short and trimmed like the hair on his head.<br />
<br />
Mike was leaner than Dylan but looked like he might end up just as furry, a line of blond fuzz was growing up the middle of his abs, and a light dusting sprouting along his pectorals. Dylan could even make out the thick bushes of dark blond hair in Mike&#39;s pits. Despite Mike&#39;s more trim body, his shorts still eventually gave way, the fly snapping open, but they just dropped to the floor around his ankles. His boxers looked a little tight, but Mike pushed them down and letting his new man-sized dick free. It was hard to tell on the camera, but Dylan thought he might be the bigger of the two, still Mike&#39;s cock was still above average, with a pair of hefty balls that, unlike the cock, might be bigger than Dylan&#39;s.<br />
<br />
As Mike&#39;s body hair continued to fill out his hair line retreated a little, not enough to be balding by any means, but it did make him appear that much older. He still had a handsome face though, his boy-next-door features matured. Soon his pecs and six pack were covered by a short but dense crop of blond hair that did nothing to hide the well sculpted, athletic body. Dylan rubbed his own stomach with a smile, glad to see the pills effected everyone differently. He was enjoying being burly, but he had to admit Mike was just plain hot. Hell, they were both complete DILFs after all.<br />
<br />
Mike was rather occupied stroking his own tool. Seemingly forgetting he was in Dylan&#39;s kitchen as he jerked himself off. His eyes slid shut and his new cock obliged his stroking by unloading a mess of his cum onto the floor. Dylan&#39;s cock responded in kind, his pent up lust from watching his friend change finally getting to him. He quickly cleaned himself off and stood. Shutting off the camera, he knew he was going to watch that footage a lot, he opened his door and headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
Mike was still gripping the counter and basking in his post orgasm bliss as Dylan entered, causing his friend to jump. &quot;Shit!&quot; Then Mike blinked at his own voice, deep and smooth. &quot;Was that.. holy.. Who.. Dylan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan spread his arms wide as Mike said his name. &quot;In the flesh. So, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re fucking insane. What was that?&quot; Mike though was eyeing Dylan&#39;s body, almost hungrily, and Dylan was probably returning the look. He had never thought of his friend as a potential sexual partner, or any guy really. He thought he was perfectly straight and Mike was as well, he just wanted a partner for an evening of adult shenanigans. But now that they were faced with each other.. maybe it was the pill.<br />
<br />
&quot;DILF pills. Makes you into an adult for 24 hours, a DILFy adult, but an adult.&quot; Dylan said as he sat down on the couch in the living room. He laid his arms along the back of the couch, and spread his legs wide, giving Mike a good view of all he had on offer. &quot;I figured we could make a night of it, get some booze, maybe some cigars, do all those adult things and enjoy ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike was eyeing Dylan again, he actually licked his lips as he did, then shook his head as if clearing it. &quot;Little problem. Clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something in my dad&#39;s closet.&quot; He was more convinced that was true for Mike than himself. While Mike was clearly more of an otter, and Dylan had no idea how he knew that terminology, and only a little bigger than Dylan&#39;s dad, Dylan was full on muscle bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I say no?&quot; Mike said, arms crossed over his twin chest muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re still stuck like this for a day. So might as well make the most of it.&quot; Dylan grinned and Mike only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but let&#39;s get some clothes on, you&#39;re distracting me.&quot;</p>
