<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I know exactly who I want up here first!&quot; Kylie grinned, white teeth shining from her perfect lips at the bewildered teens. &quot;The lady of the hour of course! The one who has made all of this possible! Jennifer Smith!&quot; Jens heart sank, she had somehow felt she was going to be this dreadful woman's first choice. She didn't move to take her spot on stage. She couldn't. Her legs were lead filled lumps below her. Kylie's grin broadened. <br />
	&quot;Oh, don't be afraid! It will be over before you know it. Bring Tom with you for comfort.&quot; Jen had forgotten Tom, who now stood like a statue next to her, not able to tear his eyes from the woman in black. She grabbed his hand and squeezed but still made no move. Kylie's eyes narrowed. &quot;Get up here now, both of you, before I turn you both into slugs and dip you in salt.&quot; There was no emotion in her voice as she said it. They both moved. <br />
	When they joined Kylie on stage she had them both face the audience and although her words were for Jen she still spoke into the microphone so the whole house could hear. &quot;It is because of you Jen that I am hear tonight, at least mostly because of you. You did this to me as a matter of fact.&quot; Kylie gestured at herself and then grabbed her breasts and pushed them together. Jens stare was blank and confused. &quot;Its okay that you don't understand, all that matters is that I know what you did and that you pay for it. And you will, Jen, you will get exactly whats coming to you.&quot; Jen took a step back at the threat. Kylie smiled and turned back to the dance floor.<br />
	&quot;Everyone look at our host! Isn't she so beautiful in her cheerleader uniform? So tall and perfect. The envy of everyone at the school! And don't forget Tom! Big and strong in his football gear. Almost as popular as the girl that lets him hang on to her arm! Well it's time for a change of pace and I know exactly what I want.&quot; <br />
	She whirled back to Jennifer and Tom and pointed a finger at each of them. Then she moved her arms, pointing the finger that had been pointing at Tom at Jen and vise versa.  The effect was immediate. Where once the tall handsome Tom had stood was a short skinny boy, drenched in his football gear, his pants falling down his now womanly shaped legs and showing the crowd that he was still very much a boy. The opposite happened to Jen. She grew, nearly splitting the already tight cheerleader uniform into pieces, her breasts pressing painfully into the cloth, nearly spilling from the top. <br />
	&quot;Well that's a start. Lets do something about those costumes shall we?&quot; Kylie snapped her fingers and the costumes swapped places. Now the skinny boy who was Tom stood in the short skirt and low cut top that was Jens uniform and the massive Jen wore the grass stained football gear, her over grown breasts still pulling the fabric tight across her broad chest. &quot;Better, now for something a bit more.. aggressive. Tom first I think. Pay close attention Jen. You're next.&quot; <br />
	With that Kylie turned her full attention to Tom. She took off her witches hat at sat it next to her on the stage before raising her slender hands to her perfect black hair. She ran her fingers slowly through it, drawing it down slowly to the very end over and over. As Tom watched, mesmerized his hair began to change. It grew slowly at first but the pace quickened as Kylie sped up her own hands, brushing her hair back faster and faster. She stopped when Toms hair had reached the middle of his back, blond and silky smooth. Next Kylie moved her hands to her chest. Holding one large breast in each hand she began to massage herself, letting her fingers flick over the nipples that now showed through the black silk dress. Jen gasped as she watched Tom. His eyes rolled upwards and he moaned and the cloth that hung empty and flabby at his girly chest began slowly to fill. Again Kylie didn't stop till she was satisfied and Tom was left with two very large breast, the tops of which bulged from the top of the uniform. <br />
	Next Kylie moved her hand lower, much lower, and began to massage between her legs. The change this time happened all over Toms body. His face thinned and smoothed. His lips filled full and wet. His eyelashes seemed to bloom from his now womanly face, full and thick. His whole body changed into the perfect body for the costume he now wore. He did not change into Jen, but rather into a different woman completely. Kylie didn't stop rubbing herself till his changes seemed complete and even then left her hand over her crotch. Tom was dappled in sweat, his long hair sticking to his face. &quot;Almost there Tom.&quot; Kylie cooed. &quot;Only one thing left.&quot; With that Kylie pushed her fingers partway into herself, cloth and all and Tom gasped in pleasure or pain. His voice high and girly. When Kylie let go of herself Tom stood a complete woman, a wet spot over the crotch of his cheer-leading skirt. <br />
	Jen could only stare at her once manly boytoy. She paled when Kylie turned to her. &quot;Did you enjoy that as much as I did Jen?&quot; Jen didn't answer, couldn't answer. &quot;Lets not draw yours out too long, I'll make it as quick as possible.&quot; Kylie wasn't smiling now when she turned her vengeance filled eyes to meet Jens. She simply raised her closed fist before her face, palm facing her own body. &quot;You did this to me and its time I return the favor.&quot; She slowly raised the middle finger and Jen collapsed.<br />
The opposite changes that had just occurred to her boyfriend happened to Jen, albeit must faster. He hair shortened and muscles bulged. She filled the football gear and then some, becoming much bigger than Tom had been. Her jaw line squared and stubble kissed her cheeks. He breasts shrank and flattened into still massive pecs. Last to change was the same as it had been for Tom. She groaned loudly and grabbed her crotch, which now bulged outward, making no mistake of what she had become. Afterward she lay still for a moment, before pulling herself to her feet. She felt enormous. She looked at Tom, a perfect woman in every way. She noticed his cleavage, nearly spilling from her old uniform and blushed beat red when she felt her new body react, her pants growing even tighter. <br />
	&quot;That wasn't so bad was it?&quot; Kylie asked, the smile returning. &quot;And from the looks of it you are enjoying Toms new body as well. Now the question is should I let it go at this? Or should I make some more naughty use of you both?&quot; Kylie put her hat back on her head and laughed maliciously. &quot;Decisions, decisions..&quot;</p>
