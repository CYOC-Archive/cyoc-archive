<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen felt the knowing tingle as the penalty took effect. Last time, she had felt it all over her body, and she ended up gaining about twenty pounds of fat, making her appear slightly chubby. She gulped nervously as she wondered what horrible change would befall her this time.<br />
<br />
The tingling became localized near the back of her spine, right above her diaper (which she had almost forgotten was full of shit). She felt a snap, and a sharp warmth right on her tailbone,  and she twisted around and craned her neck to look at what was happening. To her horror, she could see, and also feel, her tailbone grow, getting longer and longer, poking out of a small hole that had suddenly appeared in the back of her diaper. As it grew, it quickly became covered in a light tan fur, and with a poof, a tuft of white hair appeared on the end. Jen&#39;s new cow tail stopped growing at about one foot. With a shakey hand, Jen reached down and grabbed it, and gave it a tug, yelping in pain as she realized that it was, in fact, real.<br />
<br />
Jen looked at herself once again in the mirror. Her tail whiped back and fourth: it was tremendously strange, to have this new appendage, but it seemed like she could move it: voluntarily, or not. Just a few days ago, she was the top cheerleader in her school. Now, she  was a chubby freak with a cow tail, dressed like a little kid, with her hair in stupid pigtails, standing in a shit-filled diaper that she couldn&#39;t take off. Just then, another line of drool exited her mouth as she involuntarily kept slobbering like a newborn infant. She felt like sobbing again, but she was too stunned to do anything. Her life was over. Kyle had won. He had all the power and she was stuck with this stupid curse and was going to be in diapers for the rest of her life. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of collecting herself, Jen threw her robe on and exited the bathroom. Sneaking over to her room (which was hard enough with her diaper crinkling under her), She tossed on a skirt and a big, big coat. She also grabbed a napkin, to wipe up her drool. She would have to walk to Suzy&#39;s, and pray to god that she was up. <br />
<br />
Jen carefully went down the stairs, past her parents who were sitting at the kitchen table, past her little brother who was playing a video game in the living room. She quietly exited and began walking towards Suzy. It was at this point that she realized the thickness of her diaper caused her to have a slight waddle. And with every step, she felt the squish of poop on her butt and spreading around her crotch. It was disgusting when it was &quot;fresh&quot; and warm, but now it was starting to cool down. Jen worried that it might dry up and cake around her private parts, and prayed she could get Suzy to change her quickly. She again felt drool roll down her neck and she wiped it with the cloth, trying to keep her new tail from pushing up the skirt, she did her best to concentrate on keeping it tucked behind her legs. <br />
<br />
During her walk, Jen realized that she once again had to pee. She sighed, realizing there was no point in holding it, she was going for a change anyway. Jen looked up and down the street, seeing no one around. Still, she felt so awkward peeing in the middle of nowhere. She snuck up to a house, looking inside and seeinng that nobody was (seemingly) home. She ducked behind one of their bushes and lifed up her skirt, trying once again to take the diaper off. When it didn&#39;t work, she crouched down, approximating a sitting position. Her tail raised up and began swishing nervously as she tried to relax and let go of her bladder. It was harder than she thought, to oveerride her potty training. She closed her eyes and thought of waterfalls, faucets, anything, and eventualy, with a deep exhale, she was able to relax her bladder as a stream of piss exited her, making a knowing hiss as it hit her diaper. It felt so good to relieve herself, That Jen let out a sigh, which in turn caused a bunch of saliva to drip down her lips.  The pee spread around the front and, in turn, made her diaper once again feel warm and moist. Once she was done, wiped her face with her hand, and continued on her way, her tail swishing behind her. <br />
<br />
About twenty minutes later, Jen arrived at Suzy&#39;s house. by this point, the warmth of the piss in her diaper had cooled, making it uncomfortably soggy. She saw most of the lights on Suzy&#39;s house were off, so she picked up a rock and threw it at Suzy&#39;s window. After there was no answer, she did it again, and then she saw a light turn on in there. <br />
<br />
The windoow opened, and Suzy looked out, rubbing her eyes. She saw Jen on the lawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen? What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a change.&quot; Jen responded, slobbering all the way. She wiped her mouth again. Suzy sighed<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, can&#39;t--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Jen shouted. &quot;The Penalty, remember?&quot; more spiddle from her mouth. <br />
<br />
Suzy quickly put some clothes on and went downstairs, letting Jen in and up to her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Jen said, wiping her mouth of drool again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. Just get in here. Lets see the damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen frowned. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever. How bad could it be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen blushed. she wiped her mouth again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... number two...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzy couldn&#39;t contain her look of disgust. Jen frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not happy about it either.&quot; A drop of drool fell and hit Suzy&#39;s carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the drool?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen nodded. &quot;Won&#39;t stop until i get changed.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Whatever. Lay down on the floor. I&#39;m not getting it on my bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen began to remove her coat. &quot;Don&#39;t freak out&quot; she said shyly, as she presented her new tail to Suzy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I TOLD you about the penalties... I tried to beg Kyle to change me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That fucking freak? Why?! You knew he would just want to torment you more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen shot Suzy a nasty look. &quot;Because YOU weren&#39;t answering your phone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy gave a guilty look, then glanced away.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry. Just, uh, lay down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen complied, although it hurt to lay on her tail on the hard floor.  She spread her legs out as Suzy bent over and undid the tape on her diaper. She pulled back the sides, and then pulled over the front, revealing Jen&#39;s mess. Jen&#39;s face was red with embarassment, and she covered her face with her hands. Not only was Suzy seeing her naked foor the second time today, but it was because she was changing Jen&#39;s shit--filled diaper. <br />
<br />
&quot;lift&quot; Suzy commanded, and Jen lifted the seat of her butt. Suzy pulled the diaper away, and Jen felt the slobbering subside as her mouth dried out. She looked down and saw that her privates were still messy with her poo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on&quot; Suzy said, holding the diaper in two finters as far away from her as possible. She ran out of the room and, after about a minute, came back with a towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gonna want to take a shower. Unless you want me to wipe your ass, too?&quot; Suzy grinned.<br />
<br />
Jen blushed. &quot;N-No.&quot; She said. She went into the bathroom and took a quick shower, feeling relieved to be out of the wet, messy diaper. When she stepped out to dry off, she noticed that Suzy had left out some of her clothes for her. Jen put on the panties, although they were a little too small and she struggled to fit them with her new tail. She also put on the oversized shirt, which fit her better than expected given her weight gain. and went back to Suzy&#39;s room. Suzy was getting back in bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;All changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen smiled and nodded. Then she felt herself start to cry again. From exhaustion, fear, anger. She gave a few sniffles. Then she asked Suzy &quot;Can i stay here tonight?&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy smiled, and patted the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Jen. Whatever you need.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen got snuggled into bed, and tried not to think abouut how she would have to sleep on her side from now on with the tail. She dozed off to sleep.<br />
<br />
For the next week, things began falling into a soort of a routinee. Jen and Suzy would meet up a few times a day, and while it was touch and go at first, Jen became used to the fact that she would have to hold her pee and poo until certain times. She took to stuffing her tail into her pants and down a leg, as well as wearing long blouses to cover the bulge it created. Of course, moost of her wardrobe was completely shot, so she was borrowing clothes from her mother as she built a new one. Things weren&#39;t great, but they were, for the most part, stable. As long as Suzy was there, Jen could get changed pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Jen was beginning to adapt to this new normal, until...</p>
