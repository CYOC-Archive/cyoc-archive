<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">INCOMING TEXT FROM MOM: Come home please! I won&#39;t be home until late, but dinner&#39;s in the fridge!<br />
<br />
Sam sighed as he swiped up to dismiss the message. He had already known it was happening anyway - his mom had never come home early lately, or at a normal time for that matter. He was used to it though, and didn&#39;t at all mind since he didn&#39;t like parental involvement.<br />
<br />
Standing up to start walking home, Sam felt a bit heavier down in his groin, but he shook it off. Probably a result of the fight last Friday, he thought gloomily. Lex, the school bully had walked up to Sam in the locker room and kicked Sam so hard in the balls that they had swollen up to twice normal size and he had had to wear a special &quot;ballcast&quot; as his doctor had called it for the weekend until the swelling had subsided somewhat. It was uncomfortable and his balls still ached sometimes.<br />
<br />
Pushing that thought aside, Sam walked briskly and turned up the music on his phone. Occasionally he caught some other kids staring at him, but Sam didn&#39;t care. Let them look, he thought. As far as he was concerned, he was just another slightly-too-short 14 year old kid. With divorced parents, but that didn&#39;t make people stare at you.<br />
<br />
Unlocking the apartment door, Sam walked in and immediately shed his jacket. Whenever possible, he preferred to be in lighter clothes. That meant shorts and a T-shirt whenever possible. Walking over to the fridge, he bent down to get a drink. As he bent down, he felt a sudden weight shift in his groin. Unexpectedly, he was off-balance for a moment before he righted himself. The hell was that? he thought.<br />
<br />
After steadying himself on the oven, Sam walked over to the couch and sat down to start some TV. He settled in when suddenly he noticed his shorts. &quot;What the hell?&quot; he exclaimed a little too loudly, before covering his mouth. Still, his eyes bugged out wide.<br />
<br />
Now Sam had measured many times before and he knew that he was swinging around a fairly average (okay, a little smaller than average but who&#39;s keeping track) cock, maybe around 2.4 inches soft on an average day. Sam wished it was a bit bigger, but of course he knew that was foolish. Genetics were genetics after all.<br />
<br />
And now here he was looking at what appeared to be a much larger cock between his legs through his shorts. It definitely seemed realistic, the head even flared out in the same way that Sam&#39;s old cock did. The main difference was that this cock was much much MUCH longer, and fatter as well. <br />
<br />
Sam rubbed his eyes, and looked again. Nope, he was still sporting a huge bulge. Trembling, Sam&#39;s fingers reached for his waistband and carefully pulled it down, looking for some illusion or trick of the light to possibly explain the outline. Maybe someone had placed something in his shorts as a prank?<br />
<br />
But instead, he saw nothing. Except his jockstrap. Which was filled quite a bit more with Sam&#39;s meat than it was previously. Whereas it had comfortably fit everything before, the fabric of the jockstrap bulged outward with an unmistakeable shape of a fat cock just underneath. Just behind the cock, two fat ball bulges, each the size of tennis balls, showed as well. Now even more nervous, Sam grabbed the jockstrap and tugged it off, pulling it down. <br />
<br />
Any doubt that this was really Sam&#39;s cock erased immediately. The fat appendage hung down low and was definitely attached to Sam&#39;s groin. It was much heavier than previously, and as Sam moved, he could feel it swing below. Sam&#39;s balls had also grown to the size of tennis-balls.<br />
<br />
Sam felt a little light-headed. Quickly, he ran to get a ruler. Placing it against his tool, he was shocked to see that soft, his cock still reached just over seven inches. Completely soft.<br />
<br />
But as Sam watched, his new cock jerked and slowly began to inflate, growing longer and longer and raising until it stood completely erect. Sam stared wide-eyed at the flagpole emerging from his groin. Barely managing to hold the measuring stick against it, he found that it measured 11 inches when erect. ELEVEN INCHES! Sam couldn&#39;t believe it. He felt confused, nervous, but also... happy?<br />
<br />
Sam suddenly wondered - did he even have clothes that could fit the beast? Pulling his jockstrap up again proved a tight fit, and the jock didn&#39;t conceal the enormous bulge. Even with his shorts back on, Sam&#39;s cock still showed through the material plain as day.<br />
<br />
Racing upstairs, Sam went to go look in his underwear collection. He knew he was currently wearing a medium jockstrap, but he knew a relative had given him a large jockstrap as a gag gift several years ago. He had laughed it off then, but now he searched desperately.<br />
<br />
Finally he found the large jockstrap. Quickly stepping into it and pulling it up, he sighed in relief. The material was no longer incredibly tight around his genitals, but it also meant that Sam&#39;s bulge would be enormous. He would have to live with that anyway.</p>
