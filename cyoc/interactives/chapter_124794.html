<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Up until an hour ago, Justin had been an eighteen year old boy with short, spiked dark hair and a slender small build. This teenager had hated the way his family wouldn’t stop controlling all aspects of his life so in an act of angsty rebellion he had his gotten his left ear pierced the moment he moved out. He had been proud of himself for that amazing feat of rebelliousness, and this was just the beginning. From now on, he wouldn’t take orders or submit to anyone. Yes, from then on he would be an adult who’ll make his own decisions. A true man.<br />
<br />
But that dream had rapidly fallen apart.<br />
<br />
“Now, Justin The Chair, thank me for making use of you today and tell me how excited you are to be my chair at the staff meeting.” Said Professor MacGuffin with a wide smile.<br />
<br />
The shivering and sweaty chair couldn’t believe what it was hearing. “You want me to be a chair?... *Your* chair?” He added looking at the Professor’s ample bottom. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me! You’ve just fingered me like I wouldn’t care! I’m going to report you for harassment!”<br />
<br />
The Professor shook his head. “Tsk, tsk, such foul language for school property to use... Of course I wouldn’t finger the anal tract of one of my own students. As a respectable teacher at this institution I have to ensure that all of the school property is tested thoroughly to our standards. If any parent would find out that one of our chairs had shitstains on its backside or a leakage on one of its useless vestiges of former humanity they’d sue us!”<br />
<br />
The human skin-colored chair’s legs shriveled up in shame. “But I’m still human! This is a major misunderstanding!” Justin tried all he could to cover up the obscene penis and testicles that dangled off below his seat but it was futile. His former legs and arms weren’t able to articulate, they were just fleshy wooden sticks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, now I see what’s the problem...” Professor MacGuffin began to sympathize. “You’re having second thoughts, don’t you? There’s no need to be ashamed of your interest in Inanimate Intelligence. In fact, barely any students choose to undergo this degree, and your enthusiasm could help our school get additional financial grants. I’m really excited for you, Justin The Chair, I really hope you start a trend among our students. I promise I will do anything in my power to let you achieve your dreams...”<br />
<br />
Suddenly MacGuffin’s face got very dark and serious.“...That is unless you just transformed yourself into an inanimate object without permission nor an educational purpose, which is against the school regulations and would have you permanently expelled on a whim?”<br />
<br />
Justin wasn’t sure where his heart was located now, if it didn’t just turn into wood that is, but he could feel it racing. He just couldn’t abandon his dreams of independence and success that easily by telling the professor the truth. But accepting to go along with the older man’s plan would mean having to act like a chair. A fucking chair!<br />
<br />
The young boy’s face imprinted on the backrest of the chair took a deep breath. “You’re right, I transformed myself because I really love Inanimate Intelligence. But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I...”<br />
<br />
“Amazing! Now that’s a good chair!” Interrupted the professor excitedly. “Now, there’s almost no time left until the staff meeting, but I’ll give you a crash course for you to act like proper school property. First, you should avoid the use of the word ‘I’ as most as possible. People don’t expect objects to have opinions and feelings. Everything you do is about your owner’s convenience and comfort. Second, stop looking so nervous and embarrassed. You’re a chair, freaking act like it! Do you see that flower pot looking all flustered because everyone can it in the middle of the hallway with no clothes on? No? Of course not! And lastly, keep yourself clean. Of course I don’t expect an inanimate object to clean itself, that’s the janitor’s job.” The professor put his hand on Justin’s seat. “I see you showered before transforming yourself, but you’re still full of hair in the most unexpected places. You barely have any on your seat, but your backrest is full of stubble and ugh, your legs and under your seat look like a forest of black hairs.”<br />
<br />
“N-no! Don’t touch me under my seat!” Justin gasped as the man’s hand grasped at his pubic area.<br />
<br />
“What did I just told you, chair?”<br />
<br />
“Umm...” Justin swallowed his pride. “...Thank you, sir, for making maintenance under my seat...”<br />
<br />
“That’s better.” Said the professor as he retracted the boy’s foreskin to make sure there wasn’t any smegma. “I think you look vaguely presentable. I’ll take you to the staff meeting and afterwards I’ll have the janitor have a thorough look at you.”<br />
<br />
Oh shit, wasn’t the janitor the huge burly man Justin had seen cleaning the bathrooms before? He looked like a brute. The chair’s genitals shriveled a bit thinking about being manhandled by such a mountain of a man.<br />
<br />
“The staff meeting is this way. Follow me, chair.”<br />
<br />
“O-of course, sir!” The pink chair said as it struggled to move his legs around. They weren’t the most comfortable way to walk, but Justin prefered this to being dragged by his backrest. Which is what the professor had to do after the chair wouldn’t stop panting and sweating after walking awkwardly through the hallways, fully aware of his cock and balls swaying side to side below his seat. Thank goodness most of the hallways were empty as classes had just started.<br />
<br />
But his relief was short-lived. When the professor entered the classroom being used for the staff meeting the chair saw about thirty people. Some of them were definitely teachers but most of them looked like rich people checking out the results of their investments in the school.<br />
<br />
“Wait for your cue outside, chair.” The professor said before closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Justin was left shivering in fear for a while before his grand debut.<br />
<br />
“And now, I’d like to present you to someone, it’s a new student for our school. He loves our school and what we teach so much, he has volunteered himself for our latest program to foment Inanimate Intelligence studies. I present to you, Justin The Chair.”<br />
<br />
The door opened and Justin supposed that was his cue. The chair walked towards the front of the silent classroom, his legs shaky and making audible creaking noises as he paraded in front of the expecting public. Everyone looked bored and unimpressed, most jotting notes and whispering among one another.<br />
<br />
The chair tried its best to smile, to not appear embarrassed over its appearance. But then everything went dark as the professor’s huge ass sat on top of Justin. He was so heavy that the chair’s legs were quivering, struggling with the fat man’s weight.<br />
<br />
“See? He’s completely functional as a chair. With our new program students can volunteer to become school property for the school year, reducing costs for the school as new equipment becomes available for use for free while the number of students is reduced.”<br />
<br />
The moment the professor claimed the school expenses would decrease, the public finally smiled and started clapping. Not like Justin could see any of them of course. He was in darkness as the professor adjusted his ass way too many times.<br />
<br />
“Please, don’t fart, don’t fart, don’t fart...” Justin wished in silence. “Wait, did he just mention this will last an entire school year? No, I must’ve had misunderstood...”<br />
<br />
The staff meeting seemed to go on for ages, but finally the professor stood up from Justin.<br />
<br />
“What do you have to say, chair?”<br />
<br />
“Er...T-thank you for sitting on me, sir...”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, you look like an elephant just sat on you.” Said the professor unaware of the implication of his words. “I’m gonna call Hank the janitor to give you a nice maintenance...”<br />
<br />
“W-wait, sir, no, I’m fine, really! I don’t need that brute inspecting me out!” The chair pleaded, but his pleading fell on deaf ears...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in Justin’s dorm room, a featureless mannequin laughed. “Hehehe, I’m sure the kid’s having the time of his life right about now!”<br />
An immobile chair completely indistinguishable from any other regular wooden chair did nothing but to stand in front of the mannequin. It used to be a boy called Lee.<br />
<br />
“Don’t look at me like that, woody. It ain’t my fault you’re faggot for that chair boy.” Then the small faceless puppet hopped back into the book once again.</p>
