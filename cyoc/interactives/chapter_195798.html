<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda was growing impatient standing there on the short stool she had been using to reach the computer, and with that tingle, a bit unnnerved. She looked at the screen again to see if she had made any mistakes (*SPOILER*: &quot;She had indeed fucked up, but she was not yet aware how badly she had done fucked up.&quot;), not yet noticing the inch in height she had grown, her pants legs shrinking by half as much, or the ever so slight heel rising on her sneakers.<br />
<br />
Amanda began her scouring and right away saw an option in the upper right corner of the screen reading, &quot;Pause & Review,&quot; which when Amanda moused over saw it said it allowed one to stop an transformation algorithm in process to be momentarily paused, checked for errors, and adjusted, just as so long as the program had not progressed beyond 5% completion. A quick glance revealed the process hadn&#39;t even hit 1% yet, so Amanda hit the button, pausing everything.<br />
<br />
As the Peterson family black cat Mittens ran a tear around the house and their mastiff Hector stared vacantly out the living room window of their fourth floor apartment at nothing in particular drooling, Amanda looked through everything again, and to her, once again, everything either looked right and/or made no sense, and thus was irrelevant to her.<br />
&quot;Well, everything looks alright, so I guess I must have been getting afraid nothing was going to happen. I&#39;ll start it back up, but if I don&#39;t see any results soon, I&#39;m just gonna shut it off and go watch cartoons.&quot; Amanda was about to restart the Chronivac&#39;s operation, when she finally saw one change that already happened displayed on the screen that irritated her. &quot;Hey!! Dumb program!! My name&#39;s not Mandi!! I hate it when people get my name wrong!! Let me fix t-&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then all the cards aligned to bring about some... let&#39;s say, some &quot;minor&quot; chaos, as Amanda leaned forward to reach the keyboard, the combination of being unaware & unprepared for the minute change in her height and heel of her shoes, Hector suddenly barking idiotically at squirrels in the top of the tree outside, and Mittens running through the legs of the stool, knocking it off-kilter, sends Amanda flying face first into the keyboard, striking a bunch of random keys with her face before falling down on the floor practically knocked out, losing a tooth in the process, the keyboard falling on the floor face down and depressing more keys before bouncing face up beside her.<br />
<br />
The whole sum of what just happened could be summed up in five major changes to the existing bimbo protocol Amanda set up.<br />
<br />
The first was that targeting had been reset from &quot;All Humans on Earth&quot; to &quot;All Multi-Celled Organisms on Earth (Excluding Plants).&quot; A pop-up had appeared reminding whomever could see the monitor that the while the Chronivac can for the most part target everyone they want, those on the autistic spectrum, unmedicated individuals with schizophrenia, and Kevin Bacon cannot be targeted nor affected by the Chronivac as per the device&#39;s second rule, but Amanda was indisposed at that moment, what with the whole falling and eating a face full full of keyboard and then floor, plus another errant keystroke by Amanda&#39;s face &quot;confirmed&quot; she knew this already, rendering it all moot anyhow. A second notice popped up in regard to this changed flag stating that all animals made bimbos will become mostly human, except that for the most part retaining only secondary and tertiary animal traits like tails, ears, and wings, though some species like worms, snakes, fish, dolphins, whales, and the such would present like lamias and mermaids, there is a random chance hooved animals can be either mostly humanoid or possibly centauroid (like a centaur), and all arthropods (like ants) and arachnids are guaranteed to become centauroid, and will generate clothes from their shed fur/feathers/scales/etc.<br />
<br />
The second was to add a small randomizer variable to the original settings meant for Amanda applied to all other applicable targets, giving a little diversity to bust sizes, wardrobesodd  hairstyles, accents to the hair (it seemed some variety of blonde or pink was hardlocked as the natural primary hair color of any potential according to the Chronivac regardless of race or species), and other minor fluorishes like jewelry or hair barrettes. In an odd way this was useful as as it stood in the original settings every human on Earth would have been Amanda&#39;s doppelganger.<br />
<br />
The third thing changed was another new setting, a setting called, &quot;Retain Aspect Ratio: Rodents, Invertebrates, & Aquatic.&quot; This setting would scale the average randomized transformations for humans to an equivalent scale for other species, namely rodents, bugs, arachnids, fish, crustaceans, and marine mammals (meaning a bimbo ant girl would still be ant-sized, a bimbo mouse girl still mouse-sized, etc.). This one was also unintentionally useful as it would be doubtful the Earth could support trillions or even quadrillions of human-sized bimbo bug, mice, & fish girls.<br />
<br />
The fourth was to alter the duration and rules of the duration of the change. Originally, the duration was set to one week. Now it was set to three weeks, unless the target becomes pregnant beforehand, then the transformation becomes permenant, and instead of the change back being automatic, it was &quot;manual,&quot; meaning any target that went the whole three weeks without getting pregnant at the end of that period is given the choice to change back or stay transformed permanently.<br />
<br />
Finally, the final modification made from the falling keyboard smacking a six-year old girl&#39;s face and a hardwood floor is the most dynamic change. It implemented the &quot;True Bimbo&quot; flag, utilizing data the Chronivac has compiled across multiple universes on the Bimbo species, the Bimbo species considered a monstergirl offshoot of hunanity scientifically known as &quot;Homo Bimbolis,&quot; which some believe if not for the diminished intellect and unbridled lust would the next stage of human evolution, primarily from Universe 42069-P, where the Chronivac first got data on them, and a universe mostly populated by beings with some form of bimbo genetics.<br />
It overrode the IQ & libido settings with a special inverse-logarithmic formula that, the smarter one is normally, the dumber the bimbo they will make, and the dumber the bimbo they are, the more exponentially high their libidos will. However, the inverse is true; if they is already pretty much an idiot, they will lose very little if any intellect, and as a result their libido will only rise marginally. This usually means most would end up roughly about no different than if this flag never appeared, but the very smart will now become extra dumb, ditzy, & horny bimbos, while imbeciles might end up somewhat less stupid and slightly less lascivious than the average bimbo.<br />
Despite this, those transformed into &quot;true bimbos&#39;&quot; when not satisfying their lust, will still retain an interest into, and some of the skills to do, some of the things that interested them prior to their transformation.<br />
This formula has a peculiar loophole though. It was written only to take into consideration the typical intelligence of human beings. It never factored in those with intellectual developmental disorders, end-stage Alzheimer&#39;s, brain functions suppressed by heavy anesthesia for the purpose of inducing a medical coma, those who are brain dead but still alive by other means, and animals, i.e. those who would have tragically low intellect. Because their intellect is SO low already, it causes the formula to underflow and instead begin INCREASING intellect and DECREASING libido, to the point those who are turned into &quot;true bimbos&quot; that happen to be brain dead at the moment of transformation will end up with infinite intellect and fully asexual beings with zero libido. Of course, &quot;true bimbos&quot; also gain the odd quirk of having inverted respect for intellect, meaning they consider being called dumb or stupid a compliment while being told they&#39;re smart is an insult: they hold stupidity in high regard, even those that should be smart enough to know better. The more intellegent ones in a way envy the dumb.<br />
&quot;True bimbos&quot; also oddly take insult at being called &quot;sluts&quot; or &quot;whores,&quot; often laying out surprisingly cogent arguments despite their mental handicaps on what differentiates a bimbo from a slut or a whore.<br />
It also would completely remove nearly the entire intestinal tract and the bladder & kidneys, as &quot;true bimbos&quot; would have no use for them, all food & liquid swallowed in the stomach is digested and quantumly broken down 100% into energy, meaning they would produce no waste; no shit or piss ever, nor could they be poisoned (in addition to being immune to all diseases), and would need to consume far less to sustain themselves. As a result, the anus and the tiny bit of intestines not removed simply become a second vagina and connects to the womb as well.<br />
Finally, &quot;true bimbos&quot; were always natural futas, and while the settings had already made this so, it didn&#39;t reduce the fertility values by 50% and virility by another 50%, meaning the probably two &quot;true bimbos&quot; could get pregnant is 75% less than that of non-bimbo lifeforms, but this would logically be balanced out by their lasciviousness.<br />
Finally, regardless of one&#39;s actual age, anyone who is transformed into a &quot;true bimbo&quot; will have a body with a physical age between 16 to 24, has a lifespan roughly 120 times that of normal humans, and will practically cease to age until about the last decade or three of their lives, when they experience a rapid decline, in which they go through a loss of their absurd curves, and experience a restoration of their intellect. Meanwhile, one born a &quot;true bimbo,&quot; a Homo Bimbolis, will present as a normal female until puberty, when they will rapidly mature, dumb down, and grow a penis above their clit over the course of a couple of years.<br />
<br />
All the other settings, including &quot;No Reality Change,&quot; meaning everyone transformed will be aware they are changing and recall their pre-transformed states, however, remained the same.<br />
<br />
As Amanda layed stunned on the floor, Mittens ran back up after skittering out of the way of her falling master and stool, and... became transfixed by a piece of lint on the Return key of keyboard. Mittens made a deft swat at the lint striking the key.<br />
&quot;Start Function?&quot;<br />
Mittens stared down her worthy adversary, that accursed ball of lint, that had floated back down onto the Return key.<br />
&quot;Save.&quot;<br />
The whir of the processors and CPU fans was a sign the Chronivac was now at work with the updated algorithm, the power of change starting here and then rippling outward from from this Missouri apartment building across the world.<br />
<br />
Still mostly out cold, Amanda laid stretched out as she began to grow again as the lower part of her shirt and the legs of her pants rode up and shrank. Amanda subconsciously rolled over off her growing B-cup breasts and onto her back, splaying her legs as the now knee-length legs of her now fuchsia pants start their merging into a skirt.<br />
<br />
Standing over her looking at Amanda curiously was a growing human-faced Mittens, almost all of the fur not on her head, ears, or tail having already been shed, some of which was weaving itself into a tiny white tube top with a cat keyhole & pink trim, a black pleated miniskirt, and black 6&quot; heel kneehigh boots. Meanwhile what fur was staying put on her head, ears, and tail turning platinum blonde, and the fur on her head was growing longer and changing in texture, adapting and becoming human hair.<br />
&quot;Nya?!&quot; Mittens cocks her head as she watches her transforimg master, a master now with E-cups wearing a half-length blouse open and tied under her bosom, and until now Mittens has been oblivious to her own changes until a lock of blonde swishes in her eyesight, which makes her pause and realize something is going on with herself.<br />
&quot;Like, nya?&quot;<br />
She swats at her hair, only to realize it&#39;s not a paw she just swung but a balled up human hand.<br />
&quot;Mittens... is human now?&quot; Mittens was realizing not only she was changing physically, she felt just a tad bit smarter, but not much, though most notably she could now fully speak and understand her master&#39;s language. She did notice, as she traded away the extra nipples on her torso for greater mass on the top row of her teats, now what humans would call &quot;G-cups,&quot; that she was starting to feel an increasing heat in her loins, a building horniness, not unlike the only time in her life she experienced estrus before she was spayed.<br />
&quot;Mandi, what&#39;s like, going on?!&quot; Mittens sits on Amanda&#39;s thighs and begins trying to shake her master awake, but instead gets hypotically drawn in by Amanda&#39;s jiggling K-cup breasts, feeling her loins getting wet, but more notably a pressure just over her clit. Mittens leans over and begins to lick Amanda&#39;s maturing cheek, slowly drawing down to her chin, down her throat, and down onto her left breast, popping out the still growing tit to sensually lick and suckle on her nipple, delighted when it reciprecated with a spray of warm milk into her mouth.<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm......&quot; Mittens delights in the milk of her master, beginning to view Amanda as more than a master but as a totes sexy mate as well, giggling as the heads of their erect cocks poke each other.<br />
&quot;I totes got to have a taste!!&quot; Mittens exclaims, sliding a hand under her skirt to spread open her pussy as she moves up on Amanda, lining up with her cock and sliding down onto her meat.<br />
&quot;Mmreeeeeow!!&quot; Mittens growled as she began to piston up as down on her master&#39;s new dick, tail thrashing, causing her miniskirt to flutter as Mittens&#39; N-cups bounced rhythmically, miraculously staying inside that absurdly small tube top, all the while around her neck sat a black choker where once her collar was, still possessing her name tag and rabies inoculation tag, but also the jingle bell it sported before, but now the bell was softball sized, making it&#39;s jangling extra noticeable. Mittens whole ensemble screamed she was ready to hit the club.<br />
<br />
Amanda was brought to by the sounds of moaning that bordered between cute & sexy, and that aforementioned bell, but more importantly, something felt good... REALLY GOOD. She wasn&#39;t sure what it was yet, she would just look past this mountain of flesh and...<br />
&quot;Wait, I got boobies, and they&#39;re THIS... big?&quot; Amanda was surprised at her massive O-cup bust, gasping midway feeling Mittens straddling her cock.<br />
&quot;Mandi, you&#39;re, like, awake!! Havin&#39; fun?&quot;<br />
Mandi? Amanda grabbed her head in pain. Normally she hated people shortening her name or giving her nicknames, but now... she was starting to find the name cute, and easier to keep up with. She leaned forward to finally see Mittens riding her rod.<br />
&quot;Wha... What is, like, going on?&quot; a confused Amanda asks Mittens.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re totes fucking, Mandi!!&quot; Mittens mewled with joy, on the verge of orgasm.<br />
&quot;Fucking?&quot; Amanda was still processing all of this, as it seemed her mental changes had mostly not occurred while she was nearly unconscious, but now awake, the Chronivac&#39;s algorithm was now hard at word cratering that IQ, only replacing the lost knowledge with that of all things ditzy, sexy, adult, cute, and, lewd. Her head was hurting with the rapid bimbofication inside her skull. However, all that pain was quickly forgotten as she began to feel a delightful pressure in the tip of her shaft.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m like, totally coming!!&quot; Amanda, or as she now thought or herself, Mandi, shouted.<br />
&quot;Me too!!&quot; Mittens responded, the muscles of her pussy clamping down as she gushes down Mandi&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
As Mandi spasms shooting her load deep into Mittens, she feels a breeze above her head, causing her finally look up and notice a 4&#39; long wagging golden blonde dog tail trailing out of a lime green miniskirt.<br />
&quot;Dammit, keep it down or you&#39;re going to get me worked up again!!&quot; Standing at the computer desk with the keyboard and mouse, dressed in a half-length white halter top and green necktie adorning L-cup breasts, several golden necklaces, bracelets, gold belts, the aforementioned miniskirt, the lime green paper hat, and lime green heels was a doggirl with a dark tan and butt length golden blonde hair, floppy dog ears sticking out the sides, wearing bright jade mascara and lipstick on her massive pouty lips, the whole aesthetic making her look like a gyaru bimbo flight attendant.<br />
&quot;Hector, like, stop playing with the &#39;puter and totes fuck with us!!&quot; Mittens coos with a grin as she slides off Mandi&#39;s still-hard dick, sitting and spreading her legs, putting both her genitals on display.<br />
&quot;Not right now, okay? Also, I feel silly being called &#39;Hector&#39; while in this form. Mastet, if you would, I defer the right to a new name unto you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, what?&quot; Mandi asks, &quot;Like, that was totes too many big words!!&quot; The difficulty of trying to comprehend Hector&#39;s sentence gave Mandi a moment to clear her mind, and gave her a moment to remember what all happened in the last hour. &quot;Like, so... this is what a bimbo is?&quot; she asks, groping her breasts.<br />
&quot;Mandi...&quot; Hector interjected. Mandi responded by looking up her skirt at her pussy. She leaned up and gave it a lick... only to promptly get smacked in the face by Hector&#39;s tail.<br />
&quot;Mandi!!&quot; Hector exclaimed. &quot;I said what would you like to name me since Hector sounds too manly for me now!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandi blinks, surprised at being denied being able to eat pussy (it is worth noting &quot;true bimbos&quot; are naturally hard-wired to accept no for an answer when it comes to sex, as rape and misogyny disgusts them), but turns her attention to her pet&#39;s question, and thinks with all the brain power her bimbo brain would afford h-<br />
&quot;Fifi!!&quot; Mandi blurts out almost immediately.<br />
&quot;Fifi? Fifi?! What the fuck, master...!!! Sigh... Whatever. You seem so gung ho over the name, and you are still my master, so there&#39;s that, and I do love how dumb you are now...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am TOTES dumb!!&quot; Mandi exclaimed proudly. &quot;And sexy too!!&quot; She then stopped, blinked a couple of times, and then repeated hetself in a more calm, blank, surreal tone, &quot;And sexy too.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked back up and asked Hector, now Fifi, &quot;Um, Fi, like, I did all this trying to show up my sis Stephie to show her what a real bimbo totally looked like... Part of me is scated, &#39;cuz like, deep down, I like, know I should be a little girl and not ready for this sexy fun sexiness, but, like, on the other hand, I am SO totes horny and want to ride my kitty&#39;s cock like right now!!&quot;<br />
Mittens doesn&#39;t help things by slightly stroking her member with her french manicured fingertips, riling up Mandi.<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Mandi drools, fascinated by Mittens&#39; teasing but desperate ask Fifi an important totally not sexy question, &quot;...like how bad did I mess up, &#39;cuz like I can totally tell I dun doodled big time.&quot;<br />
Fifi began to look at the Chronivac. &quot;Well, according to this...&quot;<br />
Fifi looked with derision to see Mandi on her knees, pleated schoolgirl miniskirt hiked up on her plump ass, shaking her rear and presenting herself to Mittens, who succinctly mounts her master and takes her vaginal virginity in one deft motion.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t... stop... Fifi!!&quot; Mandi blurts, tongue lolled out in an ahegao face.<br />
&quot;My day started off licking my nuts and obsessing over squirrels that now I know are harmless but earlier I swore were out to invade my territory, and now this... Definitely not the weirdest moment of my way... You still listening, master?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Totes!!&quot; Mandi sqeals while Mittens hits just that right spot.<br />
&quot;Anyhow, you just turned everything that wasn&#39;t a bacteria or virus on thia planet into a bimbo with a dick. That means humans, animals, everything on Earth, outside of a handful of exceptions the Chronivac can&#39;t affect, is now a bimbo or turning into a bimbo, and it looks like we&#39;re stuck this way for at least the next three weeks... unless we get pregnant, and it looks like Mittens here already cleared THAT condition. You&#39;re going to be a daddy, master...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yay!!&quot; Mittens and Mandi exclaimed simultaneously.<br />
&quot;Wait, permanent if you become pregnant...&quot; Fifi utters. She then realizes the stakes of what was before her, seeing Mittens&#39; face; a face looking like someone about to jizz.<br />
&quot;Nope!!&quot; Fifi forcefully pulls Mittens out of Mandi just in time for Mittens to splooge all over her ass.<br />
&quot;Aw... No cummies for me!!&quot; Mandi whined, starting to jill off in order to try bring herself to completion.<br />
&quot;Listen!! I can tell master&#39;s original self is still in master and a part of her even now, so I&#39;m not risking forcing master into a life as a bimbo and then let her regret it later by letting her get pregnant in these three weeks. However, if at the end of the three weeks she chooses to stay a bimbo, you two can go nuts!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Mittens utters, licking her own cum off her hand.<br />
&quot;Basically, at the end of the three weeks, anyone who didn&#39;t get knocked up will get the choice of returning to their original forms or staying transformed.&quot;<br />
Mandi started counting on her fingers and puzzling in her head, saying to Fifi, &quot;So, I could like, either go back to being a little girl or stay a totally hawt bimbo in three weeks? ...How long is three weeks?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
Mandi cocks her head in a cute fashion. &quot;.........&#39;Kay!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mittens turns to Fifi and asks, &quot;Wait, why are you like, so smarty?! You were such a dum-dum doggy!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fifi answers her, &quot;Well, it seems it has to do with how smart we were before we changed. You two were actually quite clever before this, so now you&#39;re dumber than bricks and ten times as horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandi & Mittens try to do the math on their fingers, but fail miserably. &quot;That&#39;s like, way horny!! Awesome!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fifi pats their heads. &quot;Um... you did it. Yay.&quot; After that moment sarcastic praise, Fifi went on, &quot;I, however, was doing my best, and my best was an idiot. I was so dumb the program in charge glitched I underflowed the equation, so it made smarter instead of dumber, roughly to the level of an above-average normal human. Mittens, it also raised your IQ, but did so by so little you ended up only barely more intelligent thant the average bimbo... All this talk of how dumb you two are makes me feel inadequate... Not sure why.&quot; Fifi sighs as she looks over things again. &quot;Well, it seems the program is 84% complete so far, meaning there&#39;s still some people who are still are transforming or haven&#39;t started changing yet... Speaking of people who haven&#39;t transformed, Mandi, your best friend Jenny...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandi&#39;s eyes spark to attention. &quot;Ooh!! Let&#39;s go to her apartment!! I like, totally want to see how sexy a bimbo she becomes!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yoy won&#39;t&quot; Fifi interjects.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fifi puts her hand on Mandi&#39;s shoulder and tells her, &quot;Listen carefully Mandi. The Chronivac, the thing that did this, is very, very powerful, but it isn&#39;t... all-powerful. For some reason, it won&#39;t work on some people, and in Jenny&#39;s case, it had no effect on her because, if you remember, she has autism, and people with autism are unaffected by the Chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandi was shocked and confused. &quot;So...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we should still check on her nonetheless, master. Her mother is neurotypical, meaning she DID get transformed, and I bet if anything all of this is very well upsetting Jenny much, especially if she watched her mom transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandi, for the first time since becoming a bimbo, felt something other than giddiness, ditziness, vapidness, stupidity, and/or horniness. &quot;Um... like, you&#39;re right.&quot; Mandi got up and walked towards the door, along the way finally seeing her reflection in the TV screen; tiny open blouse tied under her P-cup breasts, pink tartan pleated microskirt draped low on her hips barely covering her massive booty wrapped with a silver studded gold belt, bracelets galore on her wrists, well-defined abs on a tiny exposed waist, shin-high leg warmers, 6&quot; wedge heel pink designer sneakers, 3&quot; diameter hoop earrings, and her platinum knee-length hair done up in two pigtails. Mandi looked very much the gyaru bimbo schoolgirl.<br />
