<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>It was just two days earlier that Nelson Miggs had been ordered to lead a squad of troops guarding the prince through the World of Chaos.  By Prince Eodor Peacecraft the Seventh's command, the group had tried to make a shortcut out of the realm watched over by the deity Xom in order to make it back to the Kingdom of Quell in enough time to stop a plot against Eodor's father.  Unbeknownst to Miggs or the prince, the trip into the Chaotic Realm was all part of a greater plan by the evil sorceress Igna.</p>

<p>Igna's plan was simple enough: Leaving the caravan with little other choice than to take the ill-advised shortcut as the only way to make it to Quell before the assassin, Igna would send her minions to capture Eodor and take him away to the great fortress of Kesseck.  It existed far below a rocky cliffside in a ravine just short of the path that would have lead the men out of the Realm.  Once within its armored stone walls, Igna would use an ancient spell upon the prince to trade bodies with him.  At that time, she would be taken to Quell to oust her own impostor of Eodor in order to solidify herself as the real Eodor and the next in line to the throne.  <i>Then</i> all she had to do was find a way to kill the king.</p>

<p>Her execution of the plan was flawless save for one minor detail… Eodor's Messenger, Miggs, had gone off to scout ahead of the party before Igna had attacked them.  Over Miggs' finger was a ring that had upon it the mark of the Peacecraft family, proof that the messages he held came from Prince Eodor himself as Miggs would never leave the prince's side or ever betray him.  His loyalty was well known, as was his conviction to keep the prince safe from all who would do him harm.  If Miggs arrived with news, the ring on his finger, the king would be forced to listen to his words.</p>

<p>One day ago now, Miggs had done his best to find where Eodor had been taken in his absence and strongly suspected that he had been sent off to scout precisely because Eodor <i>expected</i> they would be attacked.  Miggs knew his way around many weapons due to his training as a child.  He grew up protecting the prince, his friend, the two of them only four years apart.  When Igna's forces descended upon the small caravan of Quell guards, they were slaughtered within minutes.  Igna <i>needed</i> Eodor, but no one else, so if Miggs had been there, he would have been dead too, despite his training.</p>

<p>Returning to the site, Miggs found the the remains of all the other guards and was attacked himself by those demons who stayed behind.  Making strides through their numbers meant nothing, as in the Chaotic Realm they would continue to appear into infinity.  Unable to discover which way that Eodor had been taken, or even if he was still alive, Miggs followed his prince's earlier command and made haste across the path that would lead to the two stone bridges that would take him over the dual gorges.  Eventually the path would take him to a portal out to the Earth Realm.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, Miggs never made it to the second bridge.  Having made his way over the first, he rested his back against the smooth face of a wall of purple colored rock to catch his breath.  He'd heard stories of those who hadn't been as lucky as he had up to that point in regards to traveling across the World of Chaos.  The stories of those who were altered or completely transformed ran through his head as he tried to push off the rock-face and continue on his run.  It was at that moment that he discovered his luck had finally run out.</p>

<p>Finding himself trapped against purple stone wall, he wished his weapons were not broken somewhere far behind him down the path.  All he had left upon him was a knife in his right boot and the shield on his arm.  So, he made due, tearing his cloak from around his neck.  He was just barely able to escape the wall before the cloak was completely absorbed into the rock face.  A moment longer, and he would have joined it.</p>

<hr>

<p>It was only then that Miggs realized that he was asleep, and that all of this had already happened.  <i>Too late,</i> he cursed as the ground tried to reach up with purple tendrils, itself trying to take him into it just as the stone wall had done.  Reaching down to cut off his left boot with the knife stashed in his right, Miggs stumbled towards the edge of the cliff, seeing the second bridge further up the rocks from where he stood.  Looking down, he was unsurprised to find that he might be able to fall <i>forever</i>.</p>

<p>The sound of heavy breathing came from behind him and he cursed his luck.  Grabbing up his shield, he thought to defend himself better this second time than he had the first.  Before him stood a demonic, gargoyle-esque creature that appeared just as tall as Miggs himself.  It roared up into the air and charged towards Miggs.  A moment of debate had Miggs consider stepping to the side and letting the creature kill itself, but it was too late.  Miggs knew that all this had already happened… so in the perspective of this dream it was almost… <i>predetermined.</i></p>

<p>The monster vanished as it slammed into Miggs shield, just as it had before.  The shield was made of the sturdiest metals and decorated with a full image of the Devine Spirit's face, colored around its edges in Quell colors.  There was a blessing upon it, and Miggs' faith had been quite strong.  Still, when he'd put his full force into the shield to slam into the creature and keep himself from falling backwards off the cliff, he was started to find the beast shatter into dust.  Much of what remained ended up in his open mouth and down his throat, gagging him.  It got into his eyes, and tried his best to rub it away so he could see.</p>

<p>When Miggs moved his hand away and saw it turning green before his eyes, the pain forced him onto his knees, digging his new claws down into the stones At the cliff's edge.  Part of him yelled out at that time that he had not been spared by the Divine Spirit, but he now knew that was false.  The pain of his spine lengthening before it tore his pants to shreds with the efforts of his new demon tail meant nothing to him now.  <i>This was a test!</i> he realized.  <i>I should not have been able to keep that monster at bay!  I was weak, and should have gone into the ravine… instead, I held my ground.  I was </i>not<i> cursed with the form of a succubus,</i> he realized, <i>I was blessed with </i>life<i>!</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Miggs awoke in a cold sweat, not remembering the time in which she had fallen asleep.  The heat of the sun had already lit up the world outside throughout the day, but it was already becoming dark.  Reaching her green-scaled hand forward, she crawled to the end of the loft within the barn, the pain throughout her form only occurring to her now that she was waking up fully.  Flinching from a pain through her spine, she fell forward onto her breasts, her head and arms going forward off the wooden second floor of the barn.</p>

<p>Miggs hissed from the pain, reaching up to her corset and ripping it off down her front like she was forcibly trying to rip off her own skin.  The muscles in her chest, behind her breasts, thickened up as her green-scaled breasts seemed to blow up now that they were free.  From being an average and normal female size, they now expanded outwards, rounding out and firming up upon her chest.  With their increase in size, she looked down to see the scales over her breasts thicken, deepening the green that they already had and becoming like plate mail.  Though she still had nipples on her breasts, they became a deep rich black and hard as if they were metal.  With the corset removed, she could see that her abs had defined themselves greater, the thickened scales traveling down over her belly and becoming like plate there as well.</p>

<p>As Miggs looked down at the corset at her side, she realized that her thickened and hardened deep green scales over the top of her old softer and lighter green scales had created themselves into a natural armour 'corset' of their own.  She could feel as the areola on each breasts winded out, her nipples following suit as they also grew thicker.  Reaching her green hands up to her new breasts to cup them, she couldn't help but wonder how absurd of a sexual figure she was going to have when this event was over.</p>

<p>Hissing out in pain once more, Miggs took her hands off her breasts and looked at them.  Fire had erupted inside of each of her fingers and her hands began to shake from the searing pain.  Each of her fingernails turned a solid black with their tips sharpening to a point… she could almost feel the cooling flow of death from the toxins that now resided within.  She could now release with a simple scratch liquids that would cause death, intoxication, or infatuation.  The spiritual energies flowing within body focused in her palms as her mind was filled with knowledge of new powers.  Her fingers slid into dark green just as the scales over her breasts and abs had, traveling along down towards her palms and passed her wrists.  As they did, the tops of her hands on back hardened up into plate.  With the scales thickening further passed her wrists, the thick dark green scales went upwards to her elbows not unlike evening gloves, except that her elbows now grew outward into sharp, ebony colored, bone-spikes.</p>

<p>Miggs eyes clenched tight as she felt a similar pain rush up her legs.  Rolling over to look at them, she watched as the deep green scales traveled up her legs from her hoofs to stop just above her knees as stiletto boots might.  Just as had been the case with her elbows, she could feel as her knee bones pushed out forward into spiked ebony protrusions.  The thickening of the scales flowed in a shimmer from her knees to the base of her hoofs as they plated over, becoming resistant to all kinds of damage.  Damage resistance or not, it was still Miggs' epidermis that was changing and it burned like someone was skinning her alive.  Still, as reserved as she was to the pain, her first real scream finally broke from her lips when her hoofs changed shape.  Blackening up and extending the heels downward, her hoofs finished out their new appearance as stiletto heeled long boots, their plates stopping just above her knees..</p>

<p>"That really hurt," Miggs weeped softly, tears welling up in her eyes.  She couldn't see that her irises had lit up as if brightened by the new energy of her form.  Their color shifted to a bright red which glowed in the dimming shadows of the barn.  Her face reshaped itself, shifting without her knowledge away from the face of this succubus she had been but to something that more closely looked like human Miggs himself.  Beyond the feminine cheek bones and slight point to her face, Miggs now looked more like himself than he had just moments before.  A female version of himself, to be sure… beautiful and idealized, but more like <i>him</i> now.</p>

<p>That change unknown to her, Miggs grimaced as the horns on her head arched backward from her skull, twisting in on themselves as they curled in tight to point forward but to the sides, away from either side of her face.  They shifted to the same deep ebony as the rest of her bones, and slowly spiked their ridges outward into something more menacing than they had been.  From the back of her head, her black hair extended downward to just above her tail, the strands growing thicker like armored dreads.</p>

<p>Getting up to her feet with surprisingly little effort, Miggs held onto her tail as she felt it thicken out over her more plump buttocks.  It extended itself by at least three feet, the end becoming thick and hard like a whip.  The very tip retained its shoveled appearance, sharpening to something more akin to a knife as it turned into ebony bone itself.</p>

<p>It was too early to get to her feet, though, as Miggs back erupted in pain, flesh ripping outwards into shreds as the 'arms' holding onto her wings thickened up, tearing the membranes of the wings themselves.  As the arms grew thicker, they lengthened outwards far to the sides, bashing their new hand-like tips into the rafters and roof of the barn itself.  Slowly she curled the three clawed fingers at the ends of he wings around the boards above her as the wings themselves thickened up, but leaving a ripped and torn appearance to them.  Surely now she would be able to <i>truly</i> fly, and even carry others.</p>

<p>As that pain subsided, Miggs stood back up.  Looking down at herself, she couldn't help but think she looked very similar to how she had appeared before.  True, she could feel a line of short spikes descended from the back of her head and travel down her spine and across much of the beginning of her tail… but besides the darker and thicker scales, she appeared much like she did before.  Miggs was in denial, of course, because with the much stronger wings, new face, and larger breasts, she was already going to be quite a shock to her companions.</p>

<p>In the next moment, she felt her waist thin up, and tingling feeling went through her arms and legs as new alien muscles wrapped up inside of her body.  She felt powerful, and the pain had subsided by now.  Taking a deep breath, she put her hands on her hips and discovered her thong was no longer on.  Running her hands across her privates, she discovered the plate mail-like scales went around her body and over her tail where her leather armour had once covered her in a thong.  Her vulva lips were smooth, but still armored… it was a strange feeling.</p>

<p>Nothing about standing naked felt wrong to her anymore.  True, Miggs knew that others wouldn't accept it, but she seemed to think covering this body would just be… wrong somehow.</p>

<p>The final strokes of transformation were the upper edges of her 'gloves' growing out into light white furred rims just above her elbows like a flourish on their edge.  The tuffs thickened up and also appeared just above the top edge of the plate scales along her legs.  <i>Kind of tickles,</i> she thought as the ridge of thick scales of her 'corset' at her waist also grew out white furs.  Soon enough, the upper rim of the corset grew out into the same thick white tuffs over the top of her nipples, as did, lightly, the edges of her 'thong'.</p>

<p>A moment later, there was some kind of cold stone feeling wrapping around between her breasts.  "The ring!" she realized, leaning over and looking through the leather corset on the ground.  Before she had entered Igna's throne room she had taken off Eodor's ring and side it between her breasts inside the corset.  "It's not here," she realized, looking around on floor of the loft.  After a moment's thought, she reached up with both hands to pulled her breasts apart far enough to see if it had been lodged there.  Sure enough, she saw it for just a moment before an ebony stone spike pushed up between the top of her corset, a thickness to it enough that the ring held onto it like it was on a finger.</p>

<p>Blinking, Miggs tilted her head at the spike of bone between her breasts.  It was a strange location to keep such an item, but it seemed to fit there.  A moment later she flinched as hard, silver colored stones pushed their ways out over her gloves, boots, corset, back, and wings.  They were thinly spaced, but seemed to create designs not unlike the armour of the guards back home.  Why, when she looked at her gloves and boots, she could actually make out the emblem of the Quell kingdom.</p>

<p>"Devine Spirit, you have shown me the light," she said, closing her eyes and kneeling down.  She shivered a bit as the pain subsided all through her body and a cool breeze blew across her exposed skin from outside.  "I will use this body in protection of Prince Eodor first, his family second, his kingdom third, and all other innocents after that," she promised.  "Though my magics beg me steal the life of men to live, I will use my best judgement to take only what is needed, and only from those who are not deserving of what they have," she swore as an oath.</p>

<p>Standing up, she opened her eyes and smiled.  "So painful," she nodded, wiping tears from her eyes, "but perhaps worth it."  She put a hand to her head, feeling a slight buzz of dizziness.  "Now, to find a male," she said, sure that the hunger would be upon her in short order if she wasn't proactive about it.  Preparing to jump down, she heard someone coming.  Kneeling, she walked to the shadows of the loft, her feet completely silent, and her new wings somewhat trailing behind her.  <i>Now,</i> she thought, <i>who might this be?</i>
