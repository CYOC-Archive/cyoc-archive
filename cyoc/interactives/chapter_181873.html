<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When she came too Gwen found her form had been moulded into two soft globes of flesh, she’d had boobs before but now she was a pair of titties, held tightly within a bra and much larger in size than her own breasts had been. She felt relaxed and happy, she liked the gentle feeling of her host breathing and her slow rise and fall. She could get used to this existence.<br />
<br />
She was trapped behind a bra and a shirt and she could definitely tell there was a big soft hoodie atop it all. He was hidden from view as her host scribbled on a paper, occasionally bumping her arm into Gwen’s round form.<br />
<br />
Her name was Katie Anne Summers, and she was a university student in an arts degree who was sitting in her bedroom leaning on her arm and doodling on the page before her. She was supposed to be working on her English homework but felt like she’d rather doodle. She hated the mandatory English classes but her parents had forced her into a school so she could become a teacher. All she wanted to do was make art and the best she could get at her university was a collection of really basic art classes.<br />
<br />
Gwen sat happily on Katie’s chest for the rest of the evening, she wanted to get a few for what Katie did on an average evening and it was honestly kind of boring. Katie just sat indoors putting off her homework for longer and longer as it consumed more and more of her evening. The most excitement Gwen got was when Katie changed for bed and her beautiful perky forms were left free for a few seconds. But Katie didn’t even masturbate or feel up her tits or anything, she just changed into a teeshirt and pajama pants before going to bed.<br />
<br />
“This won’t do,” Gwen thought to herself before Katie dozed off and she was left to plot and plan for the rest of the evening. She didn’t want to waste her first experience as a pair of tits bored out of her mind until she found a more exciting host. Katie was just a boring girl destined to be bore her way through university and become a teacher in her hometown who’d eventually sigh and agree to marry some okay guy and have a couple okay kids that wouldn’t even care about art.<br />
<br />
She put her plan into motion while Katie showered the next day. She sent a couple impulses and feelings towards her host and Katie paused as she showered and decided to clean herself more thoroughly. Sure it was boring and cheap soap brands but clean was clean.<br />
<br />
The feeing of being washed was heavenly, Katie’s hands running over her the mounds of flesh that made up Gwen and teasing her nipples. Katie had never taken such an interest in her boobs and playing with them put her in a good mood, it made her feel, sexier maybe, more alive? She wasn’t sure, Gwen was just happy she’d gotten the chance to be toyed with.<br />
<br />
Katie’s wardrobe was full of sweaters and high neckline shirts. She dressed like normal, hiding Gwen away from sight. Frustration filled Gwen as that happened and Katie paused after dressing herself and stared at herself in the mirror, feeling rather warm.<br />
<br />
“I... don’t feel right,” she commented as she stared at her body, a frumpy ponytail, glasses perched on her nose, and a big comfy hoodie on. She pulled her sweater and shirt off and began digging through her drawers for something.<br />
<br />
“There, that’s it!” Gwen screamed internally sending positive vibes to Katie who unfurled a shirt from the bottom of her dresser. She’d been given it as a gift from her mom one Christmas and hadn’t worn it once and the second she slipped it on she recalled why.<br />
<br />
She was displaying some cleavage, a low neckline that presented the skin on the top of her breasts to the light. She’d felt so awkward and uncomfortable in it back then but Gwen liked how it showed a peek of her new form off and since Gwen liked it Katie liked it too. She even thought she looked kind of cute.<br />
<br />
Gwen sent impulses to her brain that made Katie refrain from hiding her exposed cleavage. She still felt awkward from all the trailing looks but couldn’t have hide her breasts if she’d tried. Gwen was feeling so happy and confident in that moment, living exactly how she’d desired as a pair of boobs and if she could get Katie to draw enough attention maybe she could live out all her boobish fantasies.<br />
<br />
“Hey Katie,” her classmates greeted her, she was a bit different that day, not as awkward and slouched, dressed way lighter and showing off a little skin. She reacted shyly to all those greetings, used to blending into the background.<br />
<br />
Gwen was happy on her chest, resting gently inside a bra with a bit of skin showing, she wasn’t so sweaty or awkward anymore and she was feeling happy and at home, she felt even better when a handsome looking guy seated himself next to a Katie like normal and stole a glance at her chest, giving her a swift hello before focusing on class.<br />
<br />
Katie blushed hard and Gwen felt an idea forming, Katie was too modest and shy, but by the time Gwen was done with her she’d have a boyfriend and enough friends to drag her out of her shell. For now she couldn’t do much, but she knew exactly how to get things rolling.</p>
