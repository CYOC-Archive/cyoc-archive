<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate, a young man of 28 was sitting at the bar, working on a pint of beer. He was feeling lonely and bored. He wondered if anyone out there felt the same as him, had the same interests as him. He was feeling kind of bored with his life too, same things happened everyday, the same old rut. He needed some excitement, even if it was just for one night. <br />
<br />
Cally seemed to pick up on this feeling and sat down next to him. Nate looked over and found himself taken aback that this beautiful woman would sit next to him compared to all the other people in the bar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, young man,&quot; she purred. &quot;What's your name?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm...I'm Nate,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Calliope, but you can call my Cally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Cally. How's it going?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good, feeling kinda bored...came here looking for a fun time, maybe someone interesting to hook up with,&quot; replied Cally. She looked Nate right in the eyes and smiled. Nate seemed to become hypnotized. It was an easy spell for her, forced people to tell the truth. &quot;Tell me Nate, what is your deepest, darkest kink. What turns you on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformation. Seeing someone turn into something else, or even more so, imaging myself turning into something else,&quot; replied Nate, in a dull drone.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you imagine yourself turning into?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A werewolf,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh...I've never fucked a werewolf before. You're going to be fun. Esmeralda was right, it's always the quiet ones that are most interesting,&quot; said Cally. &quot;When you snap out of this, you're going to come home with me. Do you understand?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
<br />
Cally blinked and the spell was broken. Nate leaned back in his chair unsure of what happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Nate, come back to my place with me. It's a big, glorious mansion, you'll love it,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Having nothing better to do, he shrugged and left the bar with her. <br />
<br />
Nate was stunned by the size of Cally's mansion as they pulled up to it. She parked her car in front of the house and they both walked inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to my home, Nate. Every whim, every desire you have shall be yours. Nothing is forbidden, nothing impossible,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a place of...magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, anything and everything you have ever desired can be yours,&quot; Cally smiled, gesturing for Nate to follow her. <br />
<br />
The walked into her bedroom. It was a massive room, ornately decorated with hand carved woodwork and a large four poster bed along one wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; said Nate as walked into the room he took it in. &quot;This place is incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, you really are quite polite,&quot; said Cally. She walked over to Nate and turned him around. She began to unbutton his shirt and pulled it off. <br />
<br />
Nate began to feel insecure, even more so when Cally started unbuckling his belt and pulled down his pants. &quot;Please, I'm not so sure this was a good idea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, you have nothing to feel insecure about. What I care about is what is in here,&quot; she said, placing a hand over his heart. &quot;The rest I can fix.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was confused but didn't speak. He watched as Cally walked over to the bedside table and picked up a bottle. She poured some oil into her hand and started to rub it all over Nate's naked body. It took awhile, but she managed to cover every inch of his body. <br />
<br />
Nate started to feel a burning sensation all over his body. He could feel his heart start to race. Cally took his hand and dragged him over to the full size mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to want to miss this, sweetheart,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
He watched as his body fat slowly disappeared and his skin tightened. A year's worth of exercise was accomplished in mere minutes. He watched as his skin seemed to tighten and his muscles swelled. His pecs and biceps grew and became perfectly defined. He didn't look like a huge bodybuilding freak, but he was still cut, with a nicely formed six pack as well.<br />
<br />
Nate stood there, stunned at his transformation. He started flexing his new found muscles. &quot;I...I don't understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you do. It just hasn't sunk in yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to me...but why?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you got off on transformation. That intrigued me, so I brought you home. I knew I could make your fantasies come true. The next part of which will be coming true as soon as the moon rises...&quot; replied Cally.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Really?&quot; asked Nate. &quot;You mean I'm gonna...oh my god...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, it'll be okay. It'll be an amazing physical transformation and you'll love every minute of it. But you'll still be you in the end, okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Nate, trying to calm himself down. He couldn't help but wonder what it would be like.</p>
