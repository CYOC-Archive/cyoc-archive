<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Making their way back to camp, Nat and the others now settled in for the evening. Glancing around the fire, they now noticed as Miles and Chenoa lounged near the slowly burning fire. &quot;So you defeated Ezekiel Kane,&quot; Chenoa gasped in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Miles smirked. &quot;When I heard he was going after a bunch of kids I just ran up in there and clocked him with my guitar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So brave,&quot; Chenoa sighed, cuddling up next to Miles. &quot;And you&#39;re a musician. Can you play something?&quot; Miles nodded, heading back to his tent and retrieving an acoustic guitar that he now began to strum. As Miles and Chenoa now cuddled, his sister could only sigh. &quot;You going to let him get away with twisting the truth like that,&quot; Amara grinned.<br />
<br />
Miranda smiled, watching the deer girl lean back as Miles began to play. Although not too familiar with deer people, she wouldn&#39;t ruin her twins chances with this girl. &quot;I&#39;ll let him have this one mi amor,&quot; she smiled. &quot;At least for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Chenoa,&quot; Connor asked. &quot;In the morning we can help you look for your family but, I am curious about what else is out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their are quite a few others such as myself,&quot; Chenoa stated, the deer girl pulling her furry legs beneath her. &quot;Some friendly, others not so much, as well as a few who have rather bad reputations.&quot; Nat and Connor now exchanged a concerned look, they needed to know about what dangers could be waiting for then. &quot;Define not so friendly,&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And bad reputations,&quot; Spark added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skin walkers,&quot; Chenoa shuddered. &quot;There are a couple in the woods but, thankfully they are in remote areas so we shouldn&#39;t see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else,&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you familiar with the Dog men?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dog men,&quot; Amara asked. &quot;Aren&#39;t those just werewolves Chenoa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re cousins in a way,&quot; Chenoa stated. &quot;Both canines but quite different. Usually Dog men are found in the Midwest but there is a small clan here. Despite rumors to the contrary They&#39;re actually very nice, just shy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always heard dogmen were vicious,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;I&#39;ve seen them hired as mercenaries. Fought with them in the past they kept to themselves but man were they brutal in combat. I was just glad they were on my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its only a small amount of dogmen that are warriors,&quot; Chenoa stated. &quot;Most that I&#39;ve seen are quite docile, like big fluffy, puppy dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven foot puppy dogs,&quot; Spark whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nat stated, trying to get the thought of seven foot dog people out of her head. &quot;We can definitely help you find your family. I think there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;re okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just not tomorrow though Nat,&quot; Rei interrupted. &quot;Remember we&#39;re watching the Harris kids.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot,&quot; Nat grumbled. &quot;Forgot about that. Think you guys can help out Chenoa until we&#39;re done babysitting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can handle it,&quot; Miranda stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we got this,&quot; Miles added with a smile. &quot;And don&#39;t worry Chenoa. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re safe.&quot; Chenoa now giggled, flashing Miles a warm smile as the others rolled their eyes. Although Miles was laying it on a little thick, they were confident they could help the deer girl find her missing family.<br />
<br />
****************************<br />
<br />
Unpacking her luggage, Sarah gazed at the file on her bed. Although DHS had authorized this little excursion, it didn&#39;t mean they were providing alot of funds. This was how Sarah and her team now found themselves in a rather cheap hotel. A knock on the door,  now drew her attention, calling for whoever it was to come in. &quot;You unpack everything okay,&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;Sorry about the accommodations Dave. This is the best the agency could come up with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its fine Sarah,&quot; Dave chuckled. &quot;Remember I&#39;ve been doing this for over a decade now, I know how it goes. Government is willing to spend 200,000 on a missle but, pitches a fit if a field agent wants something better than a Motel 6.&quot; Sarah laughed, nodding to Dave&#39;s answer. At 42, Dave Francis had been working in the field longer than Sarah had. The two had worked together for years, Sarah finding his easy going nature a great asset to Sarah&#39;s stricter approach. Dave was a great counter balance for her, pulling the agent back when she got roo caught up in the assignment. &quot;So Dave how are the rookies settling in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far so good,&quot; Dave shrugged. &quot;Michelle and Greg are both eager to get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they&#39;re both fresh out of the academy,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;Remember how we were? Those two are barely 25, I figured we needed some fresh blood for this assignment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Dave stated. &quot;Although not sure it will live up to the excitement they have. We&#39;re sitting in Eastern Connecticut, not exactly a hot bed of excitement but, I did find something kind of interesting.&quot; Sarah paused as Dave now handed her a file. Thumbing through it, she paused as she read it over. &quot;Mike Davis,&quot; she asked. &quot;The baseball player? I didn&#39;t know him and his family lived here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Dave stated. &quot;In fact, so does Cole Harris. Started checking up on the town when we checked in. I figured you&#39;d get a kick out of knowing Davis&#39;s wife went to USC. Even played for the volleyball team a couple years ago. Didn&#39;t you go to USC?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty years ago,&quot; Sarah laughed. &quot;Thanks for making me feel old.&quot; Dave smirked, pointing out other interesting aspects in his initial investigation. &quot;Wasn&#39;t my intention,&quot; he grinned. &quot;But, I bet you didn&#39;t know he was attacked a few months ago. Home invasion, he and his wide got shot. They never found the shooter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah continued to thumb through the report, her eyes going wide as she studied the recent history of this small town. &quot;Yeah a whole bunch of missing persons cases last year too,&quot; Dave continued. &quot;Mostly vagrants or the homeless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus a local cop fired for corruption,&quot; Sarah said softly. &quot;His partner turned him in before resigning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And promptly vanished without a trace,&quot; Dave finished. Sarah continued to thumb through the report. The womans brow furrowing as she tucked her brown hair behind her ear. Looking back through different events, she began to notice a pattern. Odd things seemed to happen in this quaint Connecticut town. &quot;Missing people, unexplained deaths, celebrities?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Celebrities,&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marisa MacGregor,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;Shes an author. Looks like she moved into town last year.&quot; Sarah now thumbed through some additional paperwork, her eyes going wide at what she saw. &quot;And it looks like her husband was mugged. The local P.D. thought their was a link between the Davis family assailant and MacGregors husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is on top of what Alec was initially investigating with the Harris family,&quot; Dave finished. Sarah nodded, it was too weird all these odd events taking place in one sleepy town in Eastern Connecticut. &quot;Dyson may have been on to something,&quot; Dave said softly. &quot;Now I feel bad for all those X-files jokes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah simply nodded before turning ti Dave. &quot;Lets not get ahead of ourselves here,&quot; she said. &quot;Theres a chance it&#39;s just a coincidence.&quot; Dave simply raised an eyebrow, neither one of them buying that answer. &quot;So whats our first move Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I say we start with what Dyson was working on,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;Let&#39;s check out the Harris family tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you want to start with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coles little sister Claudia,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;We&#39;ll swing by and ask them some questions. Maybe we can finally get some answers on what happened to Alec and what&#39;s going on in this town.&quot;</p>
