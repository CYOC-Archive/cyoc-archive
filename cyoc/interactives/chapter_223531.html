<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She wasn&#39;t sure if she instigated this herself, or if her body simply wasn&#39;t done, but it began churning again.<br />
&quot;Oh fuck, what now?&quot;<br />
The answer came in the form of her backside becoming a flash of pain, before quickly subsiding.<br />
Michelle felt her hands there, and out of her back, right at her tailbone, she felt a tail growing.<br />
She gritted her teeth, feeling the bone-vibrating crunches of change happening all at once, which kept coming and coming. She closed her eyes and laid down, waiting it out.<br />
After it subsided, she tried to sit up again, but quickly regretted it, as she almost sat on her tail base. She hissed and sat awkwardly on her sides, not willing to try to sit on her back again.<br />
She felt for her new tail, and tried to move it. It came surprisingly easy to her now, having moved a number of tentacles, tendrils, or tongues at odd places around her body, and this felt no different.<br />
Before she could focus further though, she noticed something right above her pussy, on her abdomen. Or rather, some <I>image</I>.<br />
She had a womb tattoo now, which... seemed to be changing, every time she looked at it. She felt her eyes lose herself in it, and just before she did, she forcefully looked away, using her new tail to shield her own vision.<br />
Poking her internal senses, she felt this enormous bundle of reflexes sitting in front of... this. She felt it constantly changing the image, and with an odd bit of willpower, she told it to cool for a moment, and it did. Feeling safe, she took a glimpse again.<br />
It was definitely a womb tattoo, but a rather weird one. It seemed to slowly shimmer and change into new patterns, ones that easily caught the eye. The patterns also seemed to migrate inwards, grabbing your focus and keeping it there, as you continually tried to evade the shifting patterns that always seemed to make you want to look at it...<br />
She was fairly sure she had almost hypnotised herself, her eyes unable to keep a reference point, gliding over it, while the patterns constantly recaptured them and kept them drifting in a circle. Pretty scary.<br />
It glowed, she noticed. Instead of being like any other tattoo, with black ink under her skin, she was fairly sure this was bioluminescence, controlled by her subconscious.<br />
Taking her focus off of her new addition, she then looked at her <I>other</I> new addition, which currently seemed content to &quot;sit&quot; on her lap. She raised up her tail, and inspected the end.<br />
On first glance, it looked like suspiciously like a cock, it even had testicles sitting right behind it.<br />
However, as she looked closer, she noticed it wasn&#39;t like any normal cock. It looked continually erect, for one.<br />
Second, it seemed to end in a flat end, like a horsecock did. In fact, the entirety seemed to remind her a lot about horse-cocks...<br />
Not trying to make herself aroused again, she focused on the third thing she noticed, which is that she&#39;s fairly sure the testicles weren&#39;t testicles after all, but merely a holding sack.<br />
Why? Because she could see and feel all kinds of tendrils coiling inside, making patterns on the outside, snaking around, before disappearing again.<br />
She felt for them, a dozen or so, and tool control of them, using them to explore the insides of her tail-sacks.<br />
She could feel a large hole near the base, where they all could conglomerate and... push through a lot of tight corners and pipes. She looked on as the wiggling of tentacles in tight spaces seemed to form a &quot;knot&quot; at the base of the cock, puffing up, tendrils wiggling through. She still felt a few left behind as the first ones emerge from the end.<br />
And of course these tendrils also had holes in their ends, clearing her doubt of what these were for.<br />
If her mouth-gina were to the &quot;manly&quot; parts, then these definitely were there to receive (or infiltrate) the &quot;womanly&quot; parts, able to reach out and perform the same kind of extraction from someone&#39;s ovaries, as she could do to someone&#39;s testicles.<br />
She thought briefly of how that&#39;d feel, something like that pushing inside, and then tendrils emerging and poking even deeper.<br />
With a shudder, she pushed the tail away, while recalling the tendrils. She thought she couldn&#39;t subject another woman to that, unless... they were also into it, possibly. She caught herself thinking again about being able to do this to someone, and shook the thought, to take a closer look at the opening.<br />
Taking some fingers, she placed two inside, and opened it up. She was surprised at how elastic they felt, like opening her own pussy, or a pocket pussy, or... anything else rubber, really.<br />
Michelle was fairly sure she could use this like a &quot;secondary pussy&quot;, should the need arise to extract from two &quot;sources&quot; at once. If both of them were into more &quot;extreme&quot; kinds of extraction, she even had the tendrils for it.<br />
She took a moment to look over her body, feeling like she was missing something...<br />
Checking her pussies twice, then her tail, then her head for if she had grown horns or something, she sighed, and closed her eyes, letting her intuition guide her to the things she supposedly missed.<br />
And it wasn&#39;t any single thing, it was her pussy, but rather the invisible parts of her. She frowned and contorted her face in bemused and aroused parts as her instincts continued to tell her what she could now do.<br />
Her pussy could now create specialised viruses for her, to inject in others. Specialising in denying someone orgasm, letting her control when and where it&#39;d happen. She could make them increase sperm/egg production, or increase their sex drive. She even found options to make the person&#39;s &quot;production facilities&quot; produce wildly mutated DNA, giving her womb more &quot;samples&quot; to work with.<br />
Once more, Michelle was at a loss of how much she had changed, and she laid down next to the lakeside, watching the water, overwhelmed.</p>
