<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William found himself laying down on his bed, upstairs, instead of downstairs. Tomorrow was the day his parents were meant to arrive home… he had no idea what to do considering they were both going to be dramatically changed. His plan was to wish for society to return to normal, maybe even add ‘no one remembers what happened’ kind of thing, just to avoid all the havoc.<br />
It was 9:48pm. He could wait until midnight to make his wish… but he felt very sleepy, and it didn’t help that all this extra weight probably made him even sleepier.<br />
<br />
He was just going to rest his eyes for a couple hours, wake up either before or slightly after midnight, make his wish. And everything would be just fine.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
William heard an alarm going off. He reached over, trying his best to find the alarm clock without opening his eyes. Didn’t seem to be going well, so eventually he opened his eyes, trying to find it. But it wasn’t there. It then occurred to him that it wasn’t his alarm, it was the buildings alarms. For a crappy college dorm, this sure was extra crappy. Lucky it wasn’t his place. He rolled over, looking at the girl beside him…<br />
Betty? Betsy? He couldn’t even remember. He stretched, then slowly and quietly pulled himself up to find the bathroom. In front of him was a big full body mirror. Being completely nude, he just stared at himself. Same old William… but something looked odd. He scratched his beard as he pondered.<br />
<br />
“HUH!?” He yelped, quickly covering his mouth. Who the HELL was that in the mirror!? Some mid-twenties year old man, a big fat belly, considerably smaller than when he could last remember, but still considerably overweight. He had a scraggly beard, long unkempt hair. His whole body was covered in hair… he did not look after himself well. He could see his penis as well, it was… well it wasn’t half bad,<br />
<br />
“Good morning to you too,” the girl in the bed said, stretching. As she rolled over, William took a look at her massive exposed breasts, “I said it before, and I’ll say it again, it is NICE getting to play with small dick for once,”<br />
“S-small…” William said,<br />
“Uhm… yeah,” the girl said, she hardly tried to get herself up. She was, like him, a little plump. Not as much as himself, and definitely not as much as Lila had been…<br />
Lila…<br />
“I mean, obviously don’t compare yourself,” the girl started, almost falling back asleep, “but it’s nice having a dick I can actually handle for once. All these guys with their unbelievable cocks is great… but yours is my favourite,” she finished, immediately falling back asleep.<br />
<br />
Something had clearly gone wrong. He had all these memories, but he’d hardly lived through them. He was at college? No. He’d graduated college, looking for a job. Unemployed, sleeping around while he wallowed in his unemployment. He was… twenty-four, which meant that he’d skipped an entire decade!?<br />
“Lila,” he grumbled underneath his breath.<br />
Since he’d missed ten years of his life, that also meant he hadn’t fixed his wish. So everyone had been living with incredibly huge dicks and massive tits for an entire ten years, and he’d done nothing to fix it. Even looking at this girl. Sure she was pudgy, but those breasts were immense.<br />
<br />
He knew he had a phone, but had no idea where it was. He decided to test if he still had his power, and reached underneath his belly and produced a perfect version of his phone. Or maybe this was his phone… he had no idea. He looked at the screen, completely cracked. He sighed, opening it up and scrolling through his contacts, trying to find Lila. Nothing.<br />
He found a text from his dad,<br />
‘Hey Champ, let us know if you need any financial help. Living in the big city is overwhelming, so feel free to come home whenever you need :)’<br />
Classic. He didn’t need financial help, he needed physical help!? He scrolled through everything, social media, banking (wow he really was broke), even some mobile games, trying to find some idea of where to find Lila.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a knock at the door. William knew this wasn’t his dorm, so he really need to answer. But he looked over at the girl and she’d moved the blanket over her face. He’d hate to be rude…<br />
He grabbed a shirt and shorts, throwing them on himself. It felt vert natural, despite his proportions, he seemed used to this body. He approached the door, opening it just a crack, “hello?” He asked,<br />
“Master William,” a familiar voice asked. He opened the door widely, so pleased. He wrapped his arms around her, “it is good to see you as well. You are looking rather different,”<br />
“You could say that,” he said. He looked at her, she looked identical, “I need you to tell everything that has happened,”<br />
“When you say everything?”<br />
“I mean everything, over the last ten years. Everything…”<br />
“Understood Master William, shall we?” She asked,<br />
“Sure,” he said. He looked back at the girl he’d clearly slept with. He wanted to say goodbye… but he couldn’t even remember her name. He decided to just leave without saying a word.<br />
<br />

<br />
In the car, the butler explained everything. Society continued, adapting to the new changes in better ways, with much better bra support for the increased weight, as well as much more comfortable and ergonomic underwear for the new male endowments. Both parties seemed to have benefitted, and while people seemed overall less confident, it seemed to reduce bullying significantly.<br />
“So where are we going?” William asked,<br />
“To find Ms. Lila,”<br />
“H-how do you know where she is?”<br />
“I know everything, including the location of everyone and everything,”<br />
“Wow…” he said, slumped back in his seat, “what’ve you been doing over the last decade then?”<br />
“Nothing. I left when you left, and I returned this morning,”<br />
“But I was still living, right?”<br />
“Yes. You lived as if you had grown up normally, but the circumstances are different. You never considered yourself responsible for the Epidemic, and you never thought yourself capable of using your abilities, and so you never used them. And you never considered me your butler, so I had no reason to stay,”<br />
“Huh… and what was the wish?”<br />
“The wish was ‘to see what it’s like ten years in the future, if I forgot I had a wish, just to see… and I guess William too’,”<br />
“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” William said, grumpily, “so we’re like this because he made a poorly worded wish…”<br />
“Essentially, yes,”<br />
“Typical,” he crossed his arms over his belly.<br />
<br />
After around an hour of driving, the butler said, “we have not arrived yet, but I wanted you to retrieve something,”<br />
“Something?”<br />
“May I rephrase. Someone,”<br />
The two exited the car, seeing William’s house. He was almost relieved to see it. He made his way to the front door,<br />
“I wouldn’t go in yet,” the butler said, “it’s not your house anymore,” she said,<br />
“Seriously?”<br />
“Yes. Your parents sold it a few years ago, you’d already moved out,”<br />
“Damn it… all this time and I missed it all,” William complained, “well who lives here now?”<br />
“A new family, two adults, one child,”<br />
“Great, what am I even getting from here?”<br />
“The fairy,”<br />
“Seriously!?” William replied, “why?”<br />
“Please trust me, William,”<br />
“Ugh,” William groaned. He approached the front door of his house, looking for the doorbell, “why the hell would they move it,” he complained. He finally found it, pressing it and ringing the door. Almost immediately a man opened the door,<br />
“Hello?” He replied, looking out to see the butler behind this scruffy mid-twenties looking man,<br />
“Hi, I used to live here. There’s a thing I left and I was just coming to get it back,” William said awkwardly<br />
“Excuse me?”<br />
“I used to live here. I left a thing. Can I grab it,”<br />
“I-I’m going to have… to see proof that you lived here,”<br />
“I don’t… I don’t have any. It’s just a jar with… a toy fairy. It’s my sisters, from when we were kids,” William lied. Another voice from inside called out,<br />
“Oh wait!” He ran up to the door, opening it wider to greet William with a much more welcoming smile, “fairy jar, we put that in the attic when we moved in. Found it pretty quickly,” he chuckled,<br />
“Yeah I know about it too,” the first man added, “very sexual… you know a kid could’ve found that,”<br />
“Sexual?” William wondered, “o-oh you mean because she doesn’t have any clothes,”<br />
“Yeah,” the second man said, “we’ve got a child, so we hid it. Didn’t want her to find it,” he said, “come on in, I’ll show you,”<br />
“Th-thank you,” William said. He looked at the butler, she smiled.<br />
<br />
William followed the man inside, not sure if this was such a good idea. He looked around, the layout was all different. The dining table was positioned differently, the living room was a total change. Nothing was the same, even the colour of the place. It made William a little sad. All over the walls, where once were pictures of himself and his parents, a few of his cousins and grandparents, all replaced with photos of these two guys. He could assume they were accompanied by their own parents, grandparents, etc. They seemed to have a child as well,<br />
“I’m Mark, by the way,” the second man said, “you met Teddy,”<br />
“Y-yeah… you’re a lot more cheerful than him,” William said, following Mark up the stairs,<br />
“You know, we get that a lot,” he chuckled, “I assume you know how to get to the attic,” he smiled,<br />
“Yeah, I do,” William said. He pulled open the hatch, pulled down the ladder, and climbed up,<br />
“Should be somewhere in one of those boxes,” Mark said. William looked around, finding a number of mismatched and disorganised storage, “we were actually considering throwing it away, guess it’s a good thing we didn’t, huh,” he chuckled again. He was clearly a very social person. <br />
William thought he found it, it felt like a jar. Could be anything, but it felt like the right thing. He reached in and pulled it out. He found the fairy, Alyssa, sitting very quietly. The moment she made eye contact with William, he saw a look of anger. He could’ve sworn he saw some kind of red glowing around her face. He decided to produce a small bag from one of the boxes, and slid the jar inside. He climbed down the ladder,<br />
“Thanks,” William said, holding up the bag, “I found it,”<br />
“Great to hear. A weird toy your sister had,”<br />
“Oh… y’know… she wasn’t that little,” he forced a chuckle,<br />
“I get it, I had a weird brother,” he smiled, “I’ll see you to the door,”<br />
“Thanks,” William said.<br />
<br />
As he followed Mark down the stairs until he came upon the door. He sad Ted, holding their daughter in his arms. As Mark opened the door, he said, “let us know if you need anything else, we understand this was your house as well,”<br />
“Mark!…” Ted butted in,<br />
“I would like to be polite,” Mark said, smiling softly,<br />
“Thank you,” William said, “both of you,” he smiled awkwardly as he made his way back to the car.<br />
<br />
“Good job,” the butler said,<br />
“It’s whatever, I got the jar, let’s go,” William said. He went to open the door of the car, before he heard yelling from the door of his old house,<br />
“HEY!” It was Ted, and he was running with anger in his eyes,<br />
“Teddy! Stop!” Mark yelled out, now holding their daughter. Ted looked as if he was going to attack William, he was petrified,<br />
“What the hell did you put in that bag!?”<br />
“W-what?”<br />
“You heard me! What’s in there!?” He yelled out, yanking the bag from his hands,<br />
“Careful!” William cried, pulling back,<br />
“You STOLE didn’t you!” <br />
“N-no, it’s just the jar, I swear,”<br />
“Bullshit!” Ted yelled, yanking at the bag again. Suddenly the bag tore open, the jar flying out and heading right for the ground,<br />
“NO!” William shouted.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Ted had quick reflexes. He managed to grab the jar before it hit the ground. He brought it back up, looking at it, “oh…” he said, seeing that the only thing William had taken, was in fact the jar, “th-that’s… my bad,” he said, “I’m sorry about that… really,” he said.<br />
As he held the jar however, the fairy inside lunged at the wall of the jar, causing it to rock right out of Ted’s hands. It fell quickly, and as you tried to grab it, it crashed onto the floor. Shards of glass scattering all over their driveway,<br />
“Shit! I’m so sorry,” Ted said, not realising what he’d done.<br />
<br />
The fairy immediately flew out, screaming in a high pitch, but loud voice, “I HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN A BOX FOR HOW MANY YEARS!? LISTENING TO YOU TWO WHINE AND BICKER… AND ‘LOVE’ EACH OTHER. I MIGHT BE SOME MAGICAL CREATURE, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN!”<br />
“What the…” Ted said before a bolt of light hit him. <br />
Suddenly his clothes tore open, his chest exploded in muscle, his arms bulked up, his legs and everything. They covered completely in thick hair, and his face gained a mighty beard, “…HELL!?” He shouted, his voice significantly deeper. He looked like the most stereotypical ‘stud dad’, even a slight gut behind his abs. His cock erupted, growing from it’s already giant size to an even thicker, juicer, veinier cock. Hit balls grew and grew until they were so large they could’ve been mistaken for melons,<br />
“AND YOU!” The fairy yelled, flying towards Mark. He’d just seen his husband turned from hot to hunk, and under most circumstances that would be incredibly sexy… but right now he was afraid for his own life, “SINNER!” She cried, “LET’S BRING A TRADITIONAL HOUSEHOLD INTO THIS YOUNG CHILDS LIFE. RAISE HER RIGHT!” She yelled again. A bolt of light struck him. <br />
He couldn’t help but feel somewhat aroused as his body began to change. Still holding his daughter in his arms, he felt his skin smoothening. All the hair on his arms and legs disappearing right before his hips suddenly flared out. Wide. The button his pants popped off, flying across the driveway. His butt exploded outwards, tearing the pants right down the seam. His legs thickened, and then his waist thinned, but his stomach thickened. His chest started to grow into breasts and ballooned out to the size of melons, then watermelons, then even larger. His chest adjusted to accommodate them, as well as the rest of his body shrunk to fit his much more feminine physique. Lastly his face changed, coated in makeup, his skin smoothed, his nose shrunk, his lips plumped up, bigger than big. He was a total trophy wife, and lastly his hair grew, turning blonde and cascading down his back,<br />
<br />
“And that’s what a family looks like,” Alyssa said, flying around, looking at the ‘happy husband and wife’. The two moved like zombies towards each other, entranced by each others raw sexuality that they wanted to do nothing more than procreate make even more babies. However their current daughter was crying, unable to stop. The fairy pointed her wand at the child, sitting on the front step of the house as her parents started making out in front of her,<br />
“Let’s make you better than your mommy and daddy, let’s make you a little saint. The perfect little—”<br />
<br />
William quickly used a new jar and trapped her inside. This one looked fortified, much stronger than the first one. If this one fell to the ground, it wouldn’t shatter.<br />
“Shit,” William said, he looked at the baby, then at the once ‘happy’ couple. Now they were sex driven pests, unable to think or do anything that wasn’t ‘make a baby’ or… well that was it.<br />
<br />
“I can give them a serum, right!?” William called out, looking at the butler for some kind of help,<br />
“No,” she replied bluntly, out of character for her, “your serums can only affect the physical body. You can turn them back to their old bodies, but their minds remain the same. Fairy magic is powerful, that’s why it’s dangerous. And fuelled by her anger would make it even more powerful.<br />
<br />
William had to make a decision. He wanted to return everything back to normal once he found Lila… but he couldn’t leave this family like this. He had to fix it… but he couldn’t decide.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” He shouted.</p>
