<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her body shivered with the power coursing through her, heating her; muscles tensing, dick jerking. The power settled in her loins and ignited, exploding back out through her, liquid fire in her veins, her half-hard dick suddenly pressing out to its full thick length, pushing out through the fly of her underwear to strain against her pants. She gasped, curling in on herself a bit as her bones snapped more, and pressure grew on her skull, shoulder blades, and tailbone.<br />
<br />
Then she <i>came,</i> hard, blasting shot after shot of her old male seed into her underwear, soaking through, soaking her pants, the dark stain of her already tainted essence spreading, wisps of smoke rising from the dampness as it began to warp and dissolve her old garments. She screamed in mingled pleasure and pain, throwing the wooden pedestal over as her back arched again in release.<br />
<br />
Black horns erupted from her skull, behind her tiara, adding a second crown as they curved back and up. Her eyes stung a second, pupils narrowing and sclera turning black; while her ears tapered up to points, her face refining further into otherworldly beauty. From her shoulders large black wings with purple membranes ripped through the back of her shirt and coat, flames licking along the tears. Her butt clenched then wriggled in ecstasy: a nascent tail pushing against the strained seat of her pants together with her growing curves.<br />
<br />
But even as the seams of the pants began to tear, the transformation of her clothing overtook them. Kindled by her cum, the pants legs flickered and flaked away to disintegrating ash, while the remnant hardened into a shiny, black surface; a graven metal thong that rode up her thickening hips; pressing tight, tighter against her cock and balls, forcing them back and <i>in</i> as the last of her seed soaked her underwear, fusing it with the metal as a silky lining.<br />
<br />
Likewise her shirt and coat burned rapidly away, exposing the smooth belly that had replaced her sixpack, and the luscious upper slopes of the enormous globes that had erased her pectorals. Her shirt-sleeves detached and became long, half-fingered silk gloves; while the rest of the garments melted together in the heat of her manifest lust: the coat taking on a black lustre, becoming a metal bra that cradled her hefty bust, creating a deep shadow of cleavage and barely hiding her large, pink areola; her shirt a plush lining into which her thick, stiff nipples pressed delightfully.<br />
<br />
Her feet had grown more slender, arches and heels growing strong and limber to support a digitigrade stance while remaining human in appearance; now her boots molded around her predatory curves, becoming sleek, polished leather, the heels lifting and sprouting long stiletto spikes, unneeded maybe, but threatening and alluring. Her socks grew further up her longer legs into black silk stockings, straps running up from them to connect with her bottom, emphasising the flawless, pale flesh between them.<br />
<br />
The padded interior of her new thong pressed smoothly now against her groin. Her cock finished compressing into a clitoris, a large throbbing bead half-buried in her flesh, while her new nether lips opened lewdly plump and hungry below it; her balls disappearing into the wet, musky slit that quickly saturated the lining anew with hot, demonic femjuice.<br />
<br />
With a flap of her wings she launched herself into the air, spreading her arms wide, venting the power that seethed inside her with a pure orgasmic scream. Fire burst from her hands and writhed around her with tendrils of shadow; the lightbulb above burst as infernal power lit the room. Raya was complete, perfect, a succubus queen in all her glory, from her curved horns to the long, lithe tail tipped with a hard, heart-shaped spade. Voluptuous, powerful, feminine and sleek but taller even than the quarterback she had been. A dark erotic fantasy made flesh, a wet dream with the bite of a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Below her, the circle and its intricate patterns flared as the succubus fully manifested within, the five candles lighting with blue flames; and Raya felt a magic counter to her own. Trying to contain her.<br />
<br />
But the newly turned demoness laughed. Her power, her <i>lust</i> for power and sex would not be denied! &quot;What is this? Pathetic!&quot; She flexed, feeling her power rippling through her and around her, letting it expand, easily pushing back the field that tried to hold her. This enchantment was old, and she was fresh!<br />
<br />
The flames on the binding candles turned crimson, devouring the wax, devouring the candlesticks, making five pillars of hellish fire around her. The flames licked across the circle painted on the floor, obliterating it, leaving charred stone. The fallen chains melted, the toppled pedestal bursting into flame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; <i>Such power!</i> &quot;YES!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raya lifted her arms higher, the power spiraling out of her, a twisting column of shadow smashing into floor and ceiling. Flames and ashes and molten iron were pulled into it. The stacked barrels exploded, sending dark wines and ales splashing across the floor like blood; bottles fell and shattered, their thick glass pulled into the maelstorm to be shot back into the wall like bullets.<br />
<br />
The protective spell meant to seal the dark tiara finally snapped, drawing another euphoric laugh from the succubus as she felt it break before her. The pillar of burning shadow burst out. expanding out across the room, bearing the hot debris with it to be crushed against the walls.<br />
<br />
Spelstorm Manor shuddered, humming to life as it was claimed by its new mistress. Throughout the mansion, dust and mold evaporated, electric lights turning on and old candles and lamps igniting in crimson glow. The scent of female sex filtered into the air.<br />
<br />
Within the cellar, the dark aura dissipated. Raya floated in the centre of the room alone, the red-purple glow of her eyes the only light. Everything else lay piled against the walls, the provisioning door splintered and hanging loose from its hinges.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha... ha... hahahaha...&quot; Slowly she calmed from the initial rush, her pleasure receding to rational levels. She began to consider her situation. She remembered who, or what, she had been. But the new perspective that her crown had given her made her scoff at the feeble <i>man</i> she had been. She couldn&#39;t believe she had ever been happy in that muscle-bound male body, when she could look like <i>this!</i> She looked down at her breasts, her smile revealing sharpened fangs as she put her hands on her bosom, admiring cleavage and elegant hands alike.<br />
<br />
To a woman, a <i>succubus</i> like her, men were but toys. Or raw material to be sculpted into something more. If they earned that grace. She shivered again, eager to exercise her power, to turn heads and draw all eyes to worship her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaa...&quot;<br />
<br />
And she remembered her friends. Her sweet little brother. She chuckled darkly, tail switching. She did not realise the effect her awakening had had on the mansion, but she did know she had made enough noise to alert them that something was up. She imagined them trembling in fear, and her pussy clenched.<br />
<br />
&quot;This should be fun.&quot; Her &quot;friends...&quot; Oh, she still had affection for them, but she felt that could be much better expressed now if they were her loyal... servants? <i>Minions. That&#39;s the word I want.</i></p>
