<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ao Guang Island is showing a lot of potential to be a popular vacation destination. Mieni Atoll was not particular bothered they may lose business to it. On the contrary, they hoped Ao Guang will draw enough tourists to relieve some of the housing pressure on Mieni. Of course, the resort on Ao Guang has yet to be completely built, though the main hotel was at least halfway complete. The big suites weren&#39;t built yet, but at least there were enough finished rooms so that the guests wouldn&#39;t have to sleep out in tents.<br />
<br />
As part of Aiko&#39;s marketing campaign for the resort, she invited some people to stay at the resort for spring break. In particular, she invited people with a considerable amount of notoriety. First, there were the Five Elements who were big Animalian celebrities. Of course, that included their families (Nate, Maya, Liao), their families-to-be (Lenard, Mikey), and boyfriends (Gang, Mitsue, Li-Wei). Gang&#39;s sister, Fang, was also invited since she was so close to Huoxing.<br />
<br />
The other group invited where Madame Zhen and her friends who formerly had &#39;lotus food syndrome&#39;. Which is a fancier and slightly more tasteful way of saying bound feet. The five of them were only just getting noticed by the public. It helped that they had each become a different species for interesting variety. But they weren&#39;t planning on becoming the next Five Elements. The most they wanted was to send a message to people who have gone through extreme body modifications to appeal to other people&#39;s sense of &#39;beauty&#39;. Other than that, they had their own separate ambitions and goals.<br />
<br />
While on their vacation here, all parties agreed to have some of their time recorded as part of the promotional campaign for the resort. The footage certainly got a lot of attention and there were already people making reservations. Here are just a few highlights from their vacation.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
One popular video was the impromptu swimsuit show. There wasn&#39;t any real contest or anything, though the comments made it clear how popular certain swimsuits were. Shuixing was particularly popular as she managed to work off the pregnancy weight. Ruogang was also rather popular with her muscular Clydesdale body. But probably the biggest surprise was Muxing joining in. She had officially declared that she was only joining in because she and Zhen were showing off new styles of swimwear for snake Animalians. Since their lack of legs limited the options for bottoms to mostly sarongs, new designs did spark some interest.<br />
<br />
Zhen was wearing an interesting spider-themed set, with a piece of cloth on both the front and back shaped like the spider&#39;s body and eight bands going around her waist, hips, and what would be her upper thighs to hold them together. The top was more like a mesh halter top that had a web design, but it was sheer enough to be translucent, except for the cups that covered a reasonable amount of her breasts. Muxing&#39;s swimsuit was more modest, being a red bikini top and a matching band that went around her pelvis, both with thin green vertical stripes. While her outfit wasn&#39;t nearly as risque as Zhen&#39;s, her sisters noticed she was posing more obviously than usual, with her gaze mainly in Li-Wei&#39;s direction.<br />
<br />
Even Fang took part in the little show. She was hardly a little girl anymore, though the Tibetan was obviously outclassed by the Animalians. She took it all in good stride, saying she&#39;ll outdo them when she becomes an Animalian herself. However, she didn&#39;t tell them what she was planning on becoming. There was a rather mischievous look in her eyes as she said it was going to be a surprise.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The message against bound feet had spread out further than expected. Zhen and her friends assumed they were probably the last living women had bound feet, but apparently there were other women in China old enough to have had their feet remolded when it was still legal. The People&#39;s Republic of China were eager to stamp out the last bits of this rather distasteful bit of history so searches were taking place throughout the country, making sure to comb through remote villages as well. Any woman with lotus foot syndrome was offered a double-dosed conversion into any Animalian they choose along with financing the wardrobe, furniture, and possible residence changes that&#39;ll come afterwards. Of course, some political critics were concerned that this was less an offer and more than an order and these women would have little say in whether they want to convert or not.<br />
<br />
The first woman the PRC delivered for conversion was an old woman named Chang. She was rather hesitant and seemed bewildered, as if the situation wasn&#39;t fully explained to her. When asked what she wanted to be, she said she liked white rabbits. The conversion was successful, but the timidness of the rabbit combined with her own reclusive nature had made her rather shy. Chang became known for running off and disappearing when anyone talked to her. Which was quite a feat considering how her white fur stood out from her surroundings.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
And probably the most viewed video was the beach volleyball game. Between the Five Elements and Zhen & company, it was an interesting match-up. Of course, the Five Elements were experienced martial artists and have long since adapted to their Animalian forms compared to the recently-converted other team. Even with Hua using her four arms, it was a pretty one-sided game. However, most of the comments regarding the video was far less about the game being played but of how all the players were &#39;bouncing&#39; in their bikinis. The comments became so lewd that eventually the video was locked behind the Premium section of the Animalian website.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
One interesting happened on the vacation that was off-camera. Muxing was in agreement that Li and Wei are individuals and thus each should have their own mate. She could open-minded enough to share Li with another woman. Though finding a mate for Wei was going to be a tricky process. Muxing would rather be discreet about it so that they wouldn&#39;t be bogged down with applicants who may be more interested in being in a relationship with a celebrity than in an open and loving relationship.<br />
<br />
As such, Muxing privately asked Aiko if she could use her connections to try and find a suitable match for her and Li-Wei. Of course, finding the right woman for their trio (quartet?) was going to take some time. So it was quite a surprise to both Muxing and Li-Wei when Fang later approached them about possibly joining their relationship.</p>
