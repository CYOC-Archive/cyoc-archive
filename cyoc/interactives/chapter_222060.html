<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas’s mom, Nichole, was lying on the sofa. Her shift at work today did not start until noon, so after cooking breakfast, she made some time for herself. She turned the TV on and, while changing channels, she came across footage of horses, which made caught her attention. Nichole had never been specially fond of the animal, but at that moment, she began to appreciate horses, thinking about their strength, speed, size, and their freedom. It was a documentary, but Nichole was not paying attention to what the narrator said, she was too concentrated on the horses.<br />
<br />
That was until she heard Thomas’s voice. “Good morning, mom.” Suddenly she realized that she had been watching the boring documentary for a while, and turned around to see her son, “Hi honey! Are you feeling better now?” The redheaded woman, still in her nightgown, got up the sofa to kiss his son’s forehead. She was tall, with an athletic body cultivated by the time she spent playing volleyball during her youth. Her age was still revealed through wrinkles in her limbs and face, as well as the stretchmarks caused by her two pregnancies. Perhaps that was why she admired horses, so big and full of energy, racing and jumping. Even in history, horses served as transport, capable of traveling large distances, seeing the world, either roaming free or taken by a rider. It was no surprise that men aimed to be stallions, particularly because of their vitality and how they could attract a good mare to-<br />
<br />
“… aunt Veronica?”<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Nichole was again awakened from a trance by Thomas, who was asking her a question.<br />
<br />
“Where’s aunt Veronica?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, she went to…” Nichole began to smell something nice and soothing, “…work, I think…?” Although she was right, Nichole could not remember where her sister had gone, nor did she really care now. The smell demanded her full attention, and it was getting stronger the closer she got to the sofa, where she went to lie down again.<br />
<br />
“Are you feeling okay, mom?” Thomas asked to no response. He looked at the TV and saw more of the horses documentary, but he caught a glimpse of the hippo man appearing for a short time, with his finger pointing towards his mom. Then he saw that his mom had a bigger more toned figure.<br />
<br />
Nichole’s breasts had flattened to give form to strong pectoral muscles. The curves of her waist decreased as the rest of her torso gained a rectangular shape, with the fat on her pudgy belly being sucked in, leaving a well-developed six pack on her abdomen. Her dainty arms bulked, and, as her shoulders thickened and neck elongated, the top of her nightgown felt much tighter, ripping in the back.<br />
<br />
Her legs grew more than her upper half, especially her thighs and buttocks, though with how baggy the lower part of her nightgown was, this didn’t tear it apart, unlike her briefs, which couldn’t hold her growing butt. Her calves were much stronger now, and her feet were turning into “Hooves?”. While Thomas could somewhat see where this was going with the rest of the changes, the hooves came out of left field, but that wasn’t the only odd change, as, unnoticed by him, a tail the same reddish-brown color of Nichole’s hair was growing on top of her butt.<br />
<br />
Nichole’s long hair was now growing through her neck and back, at the same time her face started to shift. Her mandible subtly expanded downwards, her cheekbones retracted, while her mouth grew outwards, and her lips darkened. Her forehead shrunk considerably, as did her nose, the latter to the point of flattening. Her eyes grew, and moved slightly apart. Her ears grew larger and turned pointy, moving upwards above her forehead. With her mouth having turned into a muzzle and her nostrils expanded, the last part of the transformation happened on her crotch.<br />
<br />
Nichole felt a kick in her insides that woke her up from her trance. Something was pushing and reaccommodating her reproductive organs. Her ovaries changed into testicles and came out inside a large dark scrotum. The pushing sensation culminated with her clitoris erecting and growing continuously into a penis, covered by a sheath. This process caused great Nichole great pleasure, distracting her from noticing all the other changes that happened. She grabbed her growing member, rubbing it and climaxing once the penis reached 50 inches.<br />
<br />
The anthro horse man stood up from the sofa, still wearing the nightgown, his dick pushing the fabric of her nightgown and leaving a noticeable stain. The conclusion of the transformation also brought some mind changes that caused him not to fret over the sudden transformation, but Thomas did.<br />
<br />
“M-mom!?” he took a step back, still surprised by everything he saw.<br />
<br />
Nichole turned to look at his son, at first curious as to why he was so shaken, then he blushed, realizing what happened. “Oh, I am very sorry you had to see that, little dude.” The horse man went quickly to his bedroom to get some privacy. He took out the nightgown, finally ripping the top of it with his movements, and he took the thorn briefs to clean his genitals before throwing it away. Seeing as he didn’t have any fitting clothes, he chose to use his gown as a sort of robe that covered him from the waist down at least.<br />
<br />
He took a moment to look at himself in the mirror. The image of a tall ginger woman came across his mind, but there only stood a 6’6” horse man, with his skin covered in very thin reddish-brown hair, his mane a darker tone. He also turned around to admire his still round butt, conspicuous even when covered. “Is it just me or did this grow since last time I checked?” He gave it a light slap and neighed, pleased by his physique. Now he had all the strength and freedom he wanted. “Nicholas, you stud.”</p>
