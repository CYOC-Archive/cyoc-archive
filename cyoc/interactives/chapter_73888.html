<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave and Dick drove for a while until finally Dick had signal in his cellphone, thinking carefully he decided <br />
to call his eldest brother, but since he had decided to abandon the family he didn't have it, he tried to call <br />
Ethan but he didn't pick up. &quot;Fuck Ethan, this is an emergency.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not thinking clearly, we should go to the hospital.&quot; said Dave wanting to reason, since his newfound strength force him wasn't going to happen.<br />
<br />
Dick was furiously dialling. &quot;Hi Jess, this is Dick! it's urgent I need to speak with Ethan or Bill, but one <br />
doesn't pick up and I don't have Bill's new number! Please could you give it to me quickly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Dick, this is Mei Ling, Jessica is... unavailable for the moment. What's the rush?&quot; asked her sister <br />
girlfriend casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really would like to discuss it with Bill, can you give it to me it has to have it on her contacts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, let me check... by the way Dick you were born in the year of the Ox right?&quot; asked Mei Ling randomly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don't know. Maybe, Could you just give me the number?&quot; said Dick frustrated, but finally he got the <br />
number and quickly hang up and called his older brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; answered his brother girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Hi Steph, this is Dick, Billy's brother. Listen I need to talk to him right now, it's urgent!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... he is... eh... in the shower, I'll tell him to call you back.&quot; tried Steph to cut the call short.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's bull and you know it, he doesn't want to hear from the family, but please tell him that this is... <br />
about me, I'm scared out of my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... but it's just that... Dick, does your family has a history of mental illness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No... no that I heard... why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just. Please you have to tell me the truth, I'm on my last nerve here, yesterday your brother simply <br />
started acting like a dog, and I don't think he is acting, and I don't know what to do anymore.&quot; said Steph <br />
breaking into tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;A dog? What...&quot; suddenly Dick felt silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dick? Dick?&quot; called Steph.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steph... do you happen to know which sign is Bill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scorpio... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that one, the other the chinese one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The dog I think...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Son of a... listen Steph, please hang on. I need to make another call. I'll contact you as soon as possible.&quot; <br />
said Dick hanging up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That bitch knows something that's why she asked!&quot; said seeing red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; answered Mei-Ling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bitch, what do you know about this. If I find out you are the one who made us like this...&quot; threatened <br />
Dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down. I have nothing to do, but I may know what's afflicting you. I supposed you contacted your brother <br />
suffering from some kind of Dog related incident right?&quot; asked Mei-Ling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your sister here is also suffering a Boar related incident. Now that only means you are the children of <br />
the Curse of the Zodiac.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father must have tampered with some serious hocus pocus. But what doesn't fit is that the curse must <br />
affect 12 siblings, and according to your sis... well for the moment brother, you are only 9.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Between my half brothers yes nine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the curse is active, you must be twelve. Talking with Jess, three signs are unaccounted: The Dragon, the <br />
Monkey and the Rooster. But that's if you are suffering from the curs...&quot; Ethan hung up, the thought of these <br />
been extended to his whole family.<br />
<br />
He began making calls to all his brothers and sister, and soon finds out he is not alone. Finally he had <br />
enough and call the origin of all the problems. He calls his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello son, what's up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't give that 'hello son' crap! You fucked up big time!&quot; yelled Dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard, watch your tone!, what are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm talking about how we all are a bunch of freaks thanks to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We, who we? I don't...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sons and daughters! I just spoke with Bill and he is a lap dog and Jessica, or I would say Jessie since <br />
she is a dude now, a pig dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey just because your brother is engage and your sister is a lesbian, look I don't have time for this now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has nothing to do with that! And It's not just us. I talk with Joey. He has Melanie trapped in his <br />
bathroom fucking herself after she tried to kill him! And Gabrielle has locked herself in her room to avoid <br />
trying to hurt Raphael or Ethan, and she told me that Mike talk to her earlier about how he is a fucking <br />
Horse!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Jessie's girlfriend says that we are Cursed by the Spirits of the Chinese Zodiacs and we are all <br />
cursed because you pissed off a chinese witch or something like that. All have a different ailment according <br />
to their sign!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait all your brothers and sisters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; replied Dick before his dad hung up on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He hung up. Typical when you need him the most.&quot; Dick was furiously tapping at the phone trying to contact <br />
his father again, until finally the call went through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! what's the big idea hanging up like that, this is serious!&quot; yelled Dick back at Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dick, I know, but for now you must gather your brothers and sisters, I don't think letting them loose would <br />
be a good idea.&quot; replied Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I talk with Mei Ling, she says that it's impossible for the curse to happen with only 9 of us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen son, this is not something I'll ever imagine telling you by the phone, but you do have three other <br />
brothers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We what?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, I know its a lot to swallow, but I don't think we have time, two of them are missing, I'll go looking <br />
for them... but I need you to come get Zach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of them I suppose... Great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen take my credit card, rent the biggest camper, or campers you can find, and gather your siblings, then <br />
take them to the lake cabin, and bring Mei Ling when you pass for your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what I can gather you are my oldest son who still resemble human and can act the part. Call Mike and tell <br />
him to hid. And the others.&quot; said Jim before hanging up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dick...&quot; began Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go to town... I need to rent a camper.&quot; said Dick fuming all the way to the passenger seat while making <br />
several more calls.</p>
