<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided that he&#39;d like some input from his new friend first before he started changing her further.<br />
<br />
“Hey, before we get too crazy,” Ty laughed. “I&#39;d kind of like to talk to you. So I&#39;m going to give you speech first, okay?”<br />
<br />
The dinosaur beamed excitedly and furiously nodded. She stood in front of her giant changer and waited.<br />
<br />
Ty looked her over, and decided that whatever magic was making her living was probably strong enough to do something else impossible. He didn&#39;t need to overthink it too much. So he simply urged the parasaur to gain the ability to speak.<br />
<br />
She instantly jolted, lowering her neck as something massaged it from deep within. Her obvious enjoyment of whatever forces were warping her further made Ty gulp a little. He liked giving her pleasure. He wanted to give his little dinosaur a lot of pleasure. But he resisted his repressed urges to do something to a female, reminding himself that A) she was a tiny plastic dinosaur and B) he had just made her and she had experienced nothing. She didn&#39;t even have a name!<br />
<br />
Ty was startled out of his rather perverted thoughts by a tiny high pitched moan. His eyes bugged out as the Parasaurolophus finished her latest transformation and he stared down at the tiny plastic dinosaur. She looked back up to him sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” She squeaked. Her voice was adorably high pitched, like a tiny two inch nothing creature would be.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s okay. Don&#39;t be sorry.” Ty grinned. “Listen to you! You&#39;re so cute!”<br />
<br />
“A-Am I?” The dinosaur looked away shyly.<br />
<br />
“But anyway!” Ty laughed excitedly. “Hi! Are you okay? Do you feel all right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes!” The dinosaur squeaked. She smiled warmly. “This is much better! We can talk now!”<br />
<br />
“Pretty cool, right?” Ty beamed. “So, like, tell me everything! What did it all feel like? What do you know? Do you remember being a toy before?”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” The dinosaur considered, scratching her tail with one leg. “Uh, I&#39;ll do my best. I don&#39;t... well, I&#39;m still putting it together!” She laughed, a sweet little high pitched giggle. “Um, okay, well, now that I think about it, uh, I guess it&#39;s kind of a big blank... before. I just sort of woke up. Like... just, here I am. Does that make sense?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, it does!” Ty leaned in close and watched the dinosaur step back from his giant face a little.<br />
<br />
“Oh, good!” She nodded. “I&#39;m still getting the words. So, uh, the other questions.” She pulled her arms in and almost seemed to blush if she could. “I mean, what you&#39;re doing to me feels really good. I can&#39;t describe it. It&#39;s... it&#39;s something deep and nice inside of me. Uh... I know things.” She shrugged. “I guess I just know them. I&#39;m not sure what I actually know.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Ty laughed. “So... yeah. Anything I can tell you in return?”<br />
<br />
The hadrosaur paused, thought deeply, and scrunched her plastic face. She looked up at Ty and blinked. “Uh... you made me. So... I guess you&#39;re like, my creator?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you could say that.” Ty nodded.<br />
<br />
“Why did you create me?” She cocked her head slightly, inquisitive.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m lonely.” Ty gulped. “I... wanted to try making a friend for myself.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, noooo!” The dinosaur rushed to Ty&#39;s hand and put her little plastic palm in his. “No, you won&#39;t be lonely anymore! I&#39;m glad to be your friend! What can I do?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know.” Ty admitted. “I guess we can talk, and play, and do stuff together.” And fall in love if you want, and experiment, Ty tried very hard not to say.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” The parasaur nodded. “Oh, sure! So... I&#39;m like... a pet to you? Is that right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Ty realized back, going white. “I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean it that way!”<br />
<br />
The dinosaur cringed and shook her head, holding up her hands. “No, no, no!” She said quickly, reassuringly, “No, I didn&#39;t mean it to sound like I didn&#39;t want that! I&#39;m fine being your pet! I&#39;m just trying to figure out I&#39;m good for.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess we haven&#39;t fully figured that out yet.” Ty smiled, sitting up. “But one thing&#39;s for sure, you do need to get bigger, right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, if it pleases you, creator. That is, if you want me bigger, that would be nice. I didn&#39;t mean to demand anything, you know.” She looked around the room and bowed sheepishly. “It&#39;s just kind of terrifying being so small.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s okay.” Ty brushed her back reassuringly. “I don&#39;t want you to live your life always scared, right?”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s kind.” The dinosaur smiled. “I would appreciate that.”<br />
<br />
“So!” Ty smiled. “My other question is if you want to stay a toy or... become more real.”<br />
<br />
“More real?” The hadrosaur blinked. “Uh... you mean... like a real thing? Like flesh?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!”  Ty smiled.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” She said with a tiny gasp. “That sounds exciting! Can... can you do that to me?”<br />
<br />
“I... think I can kind of do whatever I want to you.” Ty admitted. “I&#39;m still figuring things out.”<br />
<br />
“Wow!” The dinosaur blinked, eyes wide. “That&#39;s amazing! I&#39;m glad I can help you figure out what you can do to me.”<br />
<br />
Ty bit his lip. No, Ty, no. She was perfectly naive and innocent. Don&#39;t mess with her like that.<br />
<br />
“Oh, another thing before we get started!” Ty smiled excitedly. “What do you want me to call you?”<br />
<br />
“Call me?” The plastic dinosaur looked around in confusion. “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“Your name, little miss. What would you like your name to be?”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” She nodded, stepping nervously. “I don&#39;t know. Will you give me one?” She looked up at him pathetically and sweetly at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Awww!” Ty grinned. “I can&#39;t wait until you&#39;re big enough to hug. Sure, I&#39;ll give you a name!”<br />
<br />
“Me neither.” She added, laughing nervously. Her tiny size was really making her perpetually nervous, especially as Ty moved around her. She visibly shrank into herself and stepped back, gulping.<br />
<br />
“How about... Ducky?” Ty giggled.<br />
<br />
“What?” She blinked, eyes narrowing. She obviously hated it. “Uh... sure. If that&#39;s my name, I guess that&#39;s my name.”<br />
<br />
“Nah, I&#39;m just joking.” Ty chuckled. “There&#39;s this movie...” He stared at her blank expression.<br />
<br />
“W-What&#39;s a movie?” The plastic dinosaur reeled.<br />
<br />
“Oh, wow! Nevermind, you really wouldn&#39;t get the reference.”<br />
<br />
“I... guess not.” She stared at him in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Okay, all seriousness, how would you feel about Paris?”<br />
<br />
“Paris?” She blinked, considering. “Why?”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re a Parasaurolophus. Paris the Parasaur.”<br />
<br />
This made the plastic dinosaur grin in delight and she nodded. “Yes! I love it! I&#39;ll be Paris!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, do you know you&#39;re a dinosaur?” Ty leaned in, the name issue settled.<br />
<br />
The little plastic hadrosaur named Paris blinked her plastic eyelids again and tiled her head. “Hmm. Yes and no. I... know the name. I know what I am. But... now what it means. Does that make sense?”<br />
<br />
Ty nodded. “I can teach you!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, great!” Paris smiled. “Uh...” She realized her thought and jumped. “Oh! Oh! Do you have a name, creator?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” Ty smiled. “Yeah, I&#39;m Ty. You don&#39;t have to call me creator. We&#39;re friends, after all.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Ty!” Paris smiled with her whole face, eyes lidding a little. “So! What&#39;s next for me?”<br />
<br />
“Well, we can go ahead and make you a flesh and bone dinosaur if you want. Or maybe you want to get bigger first. Or maybe we can do something else entirely.”<br />
<br />
“Like you said? Anything?” She sat on her haunches and laid down on all four limbs.<br />
<br />
“Exactly. You tell me what you want and I&#39;ll help you out.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, sure. Let me think.” The tiny toy dinosaur squeaked. “That&#39;s a lot to think about, isn&#39;t it?”</p>
