<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Making a few adjustments with this. While I approve of the noncontagious Animalia formula, I&#39;m changing its name to a Quickshot, considering the name &#39;Hybrid&#39; could easily be misconstrued in this setting. Also, big cats don&#39;t have slit pupils.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By now, it was obvious something strange was happening, though they couldn&#39;t identify what just yet. All the three girls knew was that they feeling strange. Danny had just noticed his mother getting taller and getting bigger for her blouse. He soon noticed the same thing happening to Mrs. Erickson and her daughter. It was particularly awkward for Danny to look at Amy. He already thought she looked cute before. Now she was growing in just about every way. Amy tugged at the collar of her t-shirt, which was looking increasingly small on her. And it was becoming more obvious that her modest breasts were growing inside her shirt. As Amy was getting taller, Danny was starting to notice she was looking older, looking more like her non-unattractive mother.<br />
<br />
Speaking of whom, Felicia was rubbing the back of her hand. At least the action was keeping attention away from how her cleavage was showing more than it was earlier. &quot;Why is my hand so itchy?&quot; she asked, &quot;Am I having a reaction to something?&quot; She lifted her hand to look at the back of her other one and discovered two things. First, there was thickening hair growing on the back of her hand. And the palm and underside of her other hand was growing more calloused, almost like paw pads. Then things took a more obvious turn when her acrylic nails popped off her fingertips. The reason was clear as her real nails had darkened and sharpened into unmistakable claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Felicia, what&#39;s happening to you?&quot; asked Meredith, standing up. Danny noticed that she had grown taller than him by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; yelped Felecia, also standing up to a greater height than before, &quot;I think I&#39;m getting paws!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; The others turned to look at Amy as she stood up, quite a bit taller than before. Her t-shirt was riding up higher with her new height and especially with her larger breasts filling it out. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s happening to me too,&quot; said Felicia, her voice sounding different, older. She reached up and felt her ears. They felt bigger, rounder, hairier. &quot;I think we&#39;re becoming Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous. We didn&#39;t have any-&quot; started Meredith only to stagger a little as her feet felt off-balance. They felt tighter in her shoes as the arches extended. Leaning on her chair, Meredith worked on getting them off. Amy followed her example and got her tennis shoes off. Felicia had it easiest with her flip-flops. Once their feet was bare, it was obvious they were becoming digitigrade paws. The paw pads and claws were of a distinctly feline type as golden fur was growing thicker on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we really are becoming Animalians,&quot; said Felicia as she adjusted to her new stance, her legs becoming stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t...so...bad...&quot; said Amy, though her breathing was getting more strained. It was pretty obvious why as her breasts were swelling to well above what her bra was designed to carry. With a grunt, Amy reached up behind her back for the clasp. She had trouble grasping it, but her new claw extended and cut through the strap. There was a loud snap as her bra gave way, allowing her breasts more freedom. Amy sighed with relief before fishing under her shirt and pulling out the remains of her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amelia, what are you doing?&quot; snapped Felecia, her spine tingling as she felt pressure build up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? It was going to break one way or another,&quot; said Amy, discarding her ruined bra. Her own spine was pulsing as she felt it start to extend out of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;My son is right here,&quot; growled Meredith, actually growling. Her voice was sounding deeper, not so worn. She was also baring her teeth which were sharper than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and why isn&#39;t he changing too?&quot; asked Felecia, looking over at Danny.<br />
<br />
Danny stepped back instinctively as the three lionesses turned their gazes on him. At this point, it was obvious what they were becoming. They had grown out tails that tufts of hair on the end of them, his mother&#39;s was dark brown while the Eriksons&#39; were blonde. Golden-brown fur had grown over their bodies, though Meredith&#39;s was a bit of a darker brown. They also grown bigger, with larger muscles, and breasts that were straining their tops, particularly Amy&#39;s. Amy looked and sounded more like a grown woman than a teenager. In fact, Felecia also looked and sounded younger than before, making her look more like Amy&#39;s sister than her mother. Likewise, Danny&#39;s own mother seemed back in her prime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, well, he ate the same meatloaf as us, so it&#39;s not that,&quot; said Amy, looking down at Danny, &quot;The only thing he didn&#39;t have was-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The coffee!&quot; cried Meredith.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cream!&quot; yelped Felecia. She hurried to the fridge, though she was still getting accustomed to her new legs. She took out the canister and turned it over before finding a label on it. &quot;Uh...guess this isn&#39;t what I ordered,&quot; she said sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you not notice that?!&quot; roared Meredith, &quot;Did you even bother to read the label on the box?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I have trouble reading small print!&quot; Felecia roared back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if you actually wore glasses for once and stop being so vain!&quot; snarled Meredith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you won&#39;t need glasses anymore,&quot; said Danny, &quot;Your eyesight will be improved now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danny, not now,&quot; growled his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it doesn&#39;t matter anymore,&quot; said Amy, &quot;We&#39;ve all changed now and there&#39;s no changing back. We&#39;re going to have to deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy for you to say. I hadn&#39;t planned on becoming an Animalian,&quot; grumbled Meredith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t mind,&quot; said Amy, looking down at her new body. She was definitely liking it a lot. She hadn&#39;t really decided what kind of Animalian she wanted to be, though lion was probably somewhere on that list. She didn&#39;t make the choice, but she wasn&#39;t complaining about it. She looked back at Danny and grinned. She thought he was cute before and he still was. But she wanted something more than cute. She felt bolder, a fire lit inside of her. &quot;And I don&#39;t think Danny minds either,&quot; she said with a playful purr as she sauntered over to Danny, her hips swaying noticeably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no, no, it, uh, looks good on you,&quot; said Danny, backing up a little. He was having mixed feelings right now. A large part of it was confusion, also primal fear of having three large predators so close to him. But he still had the same crush on Amy and, well, he couldn&#39;t deny she looked sexy now. He tried to keep his eyes on her eyes, not on her wide swaying hips or the boobs that were starting to peak under her too-small shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, but I want to see what it does for you,&quot; said Amy. She grabbed Danny&#39;s shoulders before pulling him in. Next thing he knew, her lips were on his and her boobs were under his chin and covering a good part of his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amelia!&quot; snapped Meredith.<br />
<br />
Amy pulled away and said, &quot;What? Me and Danny liked each other for years. Everyone could see that. And I think he&#39;d look a lot better as a lion.&quot; Danny&#39;s face was growing more pink as Amy finally said what he had been trying not to blab about for so long. He had no idea that Amy was so confident. Maybe being an Animalian really was a boost in boldness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to disappoint, but it&#39;s not gonna happen that way,&quot; said Felecia, looking at the canister&#39;s label, &quot;This is one of those Quickshot formulas. Instant vaccination after conversion is complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meredith sighed and said, &quot;Well, at least we don&#39;t have to worry about spreading it further.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s still some left in that can, right?&quot; asked Amy, walking over, &quot;Should be enough to give Danny his-&quot;<br />
<br />
Meredith crossed the distance much faster and snatched the canister. &quot;Nobody&#39;s doing anything more with this until we know how it&#39;s here in the first place!&quot; she snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point,&quot; said Felecia, &quot;I do want to know what happened to my cream.&quot; Though she wasn&#39;t against the idea of Danny getting a dose. The thought of him becoming a grown lion was a lot more enticing now.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It hadn&#39;t taken long to discover that a postal error was the reason for the wrong delivery. Namely because the original purchaser of the Quickshot was looking to see where it had ended up. Thankfully, Jason Quill was not an unreasonable man. He knew the delivery service was more to blame and was just glad the Quickshot didn&#39;t cause more trouble than it did. Meredith actually found him rather pleasant to talk to and rather enticed to see him as a lion Animalian. In fact, both single mothers and the newly adult Amelia were going to need to get a stronger handle on their new instincts and libido, especially when it was likely there was going to be two male lions soon.</p>
