<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">/!\ The beginning of this chapter might look like the &quot;In the morning… the test results are in… you are pregnant&quot; Choice written by s1, but THAT ONLY CONCERN A FEW PARAGRAPHS.<br />
Passed them, the story take on another path.<br />
<br />
Author&#39;s Note: Michelle&#39;s POV<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
You were heavily surprised at the discovery that you were lactating. Though Head Sister Julie had commented that she thought you might be pregnant, as a result of ovulating after becoming Michelle and then eating two jerks the siren way, you didn&#39;t think it would be that fast. You admitted to yourself that you really didn&#39;t know much about female things... other than the things men were attracted to, and at present two of those things you had were leaking milk. You might be pregnant, but Selene really didn&#39;t start lactating until she was further along in her pregnancy than where you were... if you were in fact pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your lactating is more than likely the result of your bond to me and thus your bond to our daughter,&quot; Selene smiled to you, as she held Lea in her arms, &quot;It&#39;ll be as we explained before I went into labor... you were there to conceive Lea as Michael. The fact that you&#39;re a siren doesn&#39;t remove that bond... and thus, Michelle, you&#39;re producing milk and magic as a result of your &quot;fatherly&quot; bond with Lea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming I&#39;m not pregnant,&quot; you said slowly, puzzled on how you could be lactating so early pained slightly by the added weight of the milk in your breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;As sirens... while we may produce more &quot;pregnancy hormones&quot; and will produce them faster than human women... pregnancy wouldn&#39;t make you lactate until you&#39;re closer to your third trimester... IF you are pregnant,&quot; Selene assured you.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about what Florencia did?&quot; you asked, looking at the baby mermaid in her mother&#39;s arms. Lea was an extremely beautiful baby and to you looked very much like her mother. Other than her tail, you figured Lea would be an exact duplicate of Selene. Lea&#39;s tail had two tones to it. The underside of her tail matched Selene&#39;s silvery colored tail in her mer form while the top half of Lea&#39;s tail matched your own tail&#39;s scarlet shade. You then reached out with one hand to caress Lea&#39;s cheek. The infant actually cooed when your hand touched her, &quot;what if she botched her transforming Michael into me... thus leading to my separating from Michael... and my magic might hurt her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t happen, I promise.&quot; Selene came forward on the bed and pressed her free shoulder to one of your shoulders, making you leak a bit more milk.<br />
<br />
- – — – -<br />
<br />
While all your strange little family came back to bed, you choose to get up and search for the kitchen. You want to find something in which you could empty your breasts of their milk without risking to poison any watter, which would also allow head-sister Julie to have some samples. (Probably far more samples than she will ever need, even.)<br />
<br />
But the room you ended in definitely WASN&#39;T the kitchen. In fact, it looked exactly like a mortuary. And like if that wasn&#39;t shocking enough, you saw Frank in full surgeon grab, about an unmoving siren probably dead. It wasn&#39;t any mermaid, either. No, the flesh in which Frank was about to cut was none other than the dreaded Florencia.<br />
<br />
Your entry in the room got noticed. At least you guessed so, since Frank stopped and, without looking at you, asked &quot;Do you need anything, Michelle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well…&quot; you hesitated &quot;I just discovered I was lactating and, since I don&#39;t know if my milk is safe, with everything and all that…&quot; Then, after a pause, you added &quot;Is that Florencia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes it is.&quot; Frank confirmed. &quot;Food poisoning apparently. Something she eat must have disagreed with her.&quot; This last part made him laugh a bit, but when you only looked at him, puzzled, he added &quot;Sorry, that was just a coroner&#39;s joke. A bad one I might add, even by coroners standards.&quot; Then, redressing and putting back his scalpel with his others tools, he said &quot;But while I&#39;m still not covered in blood, I should help you with your current predicament.&quot; before walking toward a closet, taking out two larges beaker, handing them to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; you said. &quot;Now… Now that Florencia is dead, what will happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, not even the council know. But between this and Michael not being a part of you anymore, a lot of things changed. They want to hear Florencia&#39;s sisterhood side of these events, along with the results of your DNA test… We have a DNA expert among our trusted, knowing her, she is going to stay up for as much night as she need<br />
<br />
You thanked him and were about to exit the room, when he called you back. &quot;I know you probably won&#39;t but… You can stay if you want, I could share my knowledge about sirens&#39; anatomy while examining Florencia&#39;s body.&quot;<br />
<br />
- – — – -<br />
<br />
Honestly, when you accepted Frank&#39;s offer, you surprised both him and yourself. You were mesmerized by how your new body was so different on some aspect while so similar to an human woman&#39;s one on others. You also felt like you found your new calling in life, and wondered if you could ask for some sort of apprenticeship under Frank.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t the only disturbing news for you this morning. Apparently one of Florencia&#39;s recent victim was transgender, starting transition from male to female. The testosterone suppressant in her organism, only known substance to be poisonous to sirens, made Florencia unable to feed correctly, slowly starving her. It seemed that she already was sick when she transformed you, but her magic somehow prevented her sickness from showing.<br />
<br />
You were on your way to get another disturbing new, walking toward Julie&#39;s lab. You will finally know if you are pregnant or not, but you knew that neither way, you will be weird out by the answer.<br />
<br />
But knowing if a new life was forming in your womb wasn&#39;t your only reason to go there anymore. In your left hand you transported one beaker of milk, the right holding Frank&#39;s conclusions.<br />
<br />
As soon as you entered her lab, you informed head-sister Julie that you were lactating and, handing her the beaker, that you wanted your milk to be analyzed. You also anded her husband&#39;s report on Florencia&#39;s death. Julie must have already knew about her death, since she didn&#39;t look much surprised.<br />
<br />
Before you could ask about the result of your pregnancy test, the gynecologist asked &quot;Did your wife choose an avatar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; You eloquently asked, not understanding the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;A representative, if you prefer.&quot; explained head-sister Julie. &quot;The council won&#39;t ask her going to them so soon after giving birth, that would be too dangerous, for both the baby and Selene. Speaking of the baby, what did her two parents choose to call her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking the older siren in the eyes, glaring, you answered &quot;WE, her THREE parents, choose to call her Lea. Lea Amelie Fooller.&quot; Without relenting, you added &quot;Now, I would like know if I&#39;m pregnant or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So-sorry, sorry, I didn&#39;t… Sorry.&quot; Was all Julie could say, before silently garbing your daughter&#39;s birth certificate. Her first instinct was to complete it hurriedly, but instead, she forced herself to take her time, taking great care in making it easily readable. When she finished, she gave the certificate to you.<br />
<br />
When she didn&#39;t said anything more, again you asked &quot;And about my pregnancy test?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Honestly, the result are… puzzling. Who am I kidding… They don&#39;t make sense! Not even a lick of it! I would never have thought to say this one day, but I hope it only mean my old equipment is dying…&quot;</p>
