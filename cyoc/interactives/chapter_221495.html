<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon scanned the porches as he drove past in a casual manner. Attention drawn to a package left out on the porch, he reads the company name printed in large, blue letters, and drive on. Having no interest in pet stuff, as it was almost impossible for his contact to sell, the twenty-five year old man drove on. Moving to the next block, he didn&#39;t see anything, and wouldn&#39;t find anything for a few more blocks.<br />
<br />
When he did spot a package which looked of interest, he mentally took down the address before he drove a block up and over. Getting out, he nonchalantly headed back the way he&#39;d come. Walking up the front walk, acting as if he belonged there, he still scanned the area around him. Not seeing any neighbours, or security devices, he jogged up the few steps, scooped up the package, pretended to check the mail box mounted on the side of the house, and with an air like he was examining the box left on the porch, he walked back down the steps and around the side of the house. Finding there wasn&#39;t a gate or fence or anything to impede him, Damon headed across the backyard, across the square swatch of grass of the next house over, around it, and turning onto the sidewalk, leisurely headed back to his car.<br />
<br />
Home, he let himself into the apartment he shared with his aunt and mom. Hearing the television on in the other room, he took a moment to listen to it before he determined the only one around was his bratty, ten year old cousin. Not wanting to deal with Tanya, Damon headed for the kitchen, where he collected a paring knife and sat down at the table. Stripping off the address label, he shredded it, crumpled the pieces up, and tossed the ball into a near by waste bin. Using the knife to slit open the package, he was surprise to find inside was a computer disk, a USB hook-up, and a weird looking remote. Frowning, not sure what Chronivac meant, he picked up the remote and USB connector and examined them. Thinking it had to be something which allowed a person to watch television programmes through their computer, he wondered how much he could get for it.<br />
<br />
A glance at the clock above the sink, and Damon guessed Jack might be home. The disk forgotten, the young man stood and left the apartment. Moments after he had, Tanya wandered in. Hungry, wondering when mom or her aunt would make dinner, her show at a commercial break, she was tempted to raid the fridge for something. Spotting the stuff Damon left on the table, she made a face and considered leaving it there for one of the other adults to find. Thinking of how great it&#39;d be for her cousin to get into trouble, she banished the thought, as it seemed more like her aunt would blame her and her mother would take her aunt&#39;s side. Collecting the paring knife, she tipped the box upside down, and when a compact disk fell out, she barely paid it a second glance as she flattened the box. Tossing it in the recycling bin, she put the knife back where it belonged, wandered over to the fridge, got herself an apple, and about to go back the living room, sure her programme was back on, she picked up the disk.<br />
<br />
The word printed on it didn&#39;t make any sense, nor did any other information. Taking it and her piece fruit into the other room, she saw her show was over. Losing interest in the TV, as all which would be on would be game shows and early news programme, she shut off the television. Unsure when anybody would be home, Tanya worked at her apple as she studied what was printed on the disk. Deciding to head over to a friend&#39;s place, she went back to the kitchen, left a note for her mother and aunt, considered leaving the CD, but decided to take it along. Having never had anything to do with Terence, Becky&#39;s older brother, Tanya thought maybe he would understand what she had. Leaving the apartment, she hurried the two floors down. Knocking on the door to her friend&#39;s place, she stepped back when a large, sweat-stained man in a filthy tank top and shorts opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky, your friend&#39;s here,&quot; the man immediately bellowed as he turned away, collected an open can of beer from a nearby table, and lumbered in the direction of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
She never liked Becky&#39;s dad, as the man was often only clad in what he&#39;d answered the door with, reeked of the beer he was alway drinking and the cigarettes he was continuously puffing away at, and often made crude comments when he passed the fifteen beer mark. Letting herself in, Tanya shut the door and tried to ignore the man as she headed for Becky&#39;s room, but stopped when she saw Terrence watching television. Entering the room, she waited up, with an air of annoyance, he acknowledge her presence. Holding out the disk, she waited until he&#39;d taken it before she inquired, &quot;What&#39;s this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a computer disk, dummy,&quot; Terence commented.<br />
<br />
With a huff, Tanya shot back with, &quot;I can see that, stup. I&#39;m asking you, what does it do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How should I know,&quot; Terrence replied. &quot;I&#39;ve never even heard of Chronivac,&quot; and turning off the television, he sighed, &quot;I suppose you shan&#39;t leave me alone until I figure out what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanya gave him a very determined look, and taking the hint, Terence stood. Thinking of maybe trying it in his computer, he changed his mind. Chad&#39;s computer was home built and how more protection on it than most computers. Deciding to take it over there, he told Tanya, &quot;Fine. But you&#39;ll have to have patience, as it&#39;ll probably take some time to figure out what&#39;s on the disk,&quot; and exiting the living room, he collected his shoes and coat.<br />
<br />
As he put them on, he said, &quot;This may take awhile, so I cannot guarantee results by the time I get back. Ask me in a few days, all right?&quot; and when Tanya nodded, Terrence stuffed the disk in pocket of his outer wear. Heading out, he made his way down the back stairway, passed Damon on the way down, and collecting his bike, he pedalled the three blocks over to his friend&#39;s place.<br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t know what to make of the programme after they put it into his computer and ran it through a number of programmes to determine who made it, what was on it, if there was any spyware or viruses bundled into it, among other things. The one thing neither tried was to activate it. After several frustrating hours, Chad sat back and stating, &quot;I&#39;m calling it. I have no idea what&#39;s on it. However, I could take it to a friend and see what he might be able figure out about it,&quot; and when Terrence nodded, Chad explained, &quot;I&#39;ll have it back in a couple days, if that&#39;s all right.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded and Terrence agreed. Disk set aside, the two hung out a bit longer before Terrence went home. The Chronivac left on his desk, Chad didn&#39;t do anything with it until the next day when he took it to Vang&#39;s PC. Having developed a bond and a level of respect for each other, there was no issue with Chad walking in the back way. When Vang did turn up, the teenage boy explained the situation with the disk, everything he&#39;d tried, and ending with asking the older man to take a look.<br />
<br />
With a nod, Vang answered, &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do. Come back later this week,&quot; and when Chad agreed, Vang showed the boy out before he returned to the front of the store.<br />
<br />
The jewel case set on the countertop upside down, Vang figure he&#39;d take care of it later as the bell over the door tinkled and a man in a suit walked in. Greeting Mr Snyder, Vang started to chat freely with the young lawyer as he fetched the man&#39;s laptop, placed it in a bag, and scooping up a number of compact disks, he deposited them into a side pocket on the tote. Handing the whole thing over, Vang told him, &quot;Fifty dollars,&quot; and when he was given the cash, Vang wrote up a receipt, handing it to Mr Snyder with the words, &quot;Pleasure doing business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oblivious to how he&#39;d been given at least one wrong disk, happy to have his laptop back, and it would mean he could again work from home, Mr Snyder bid the shop owner good day and left. Heading for his car, he secured the computer case in the trunk before he started to his next destination, his laptop forgotten for the moment.</p>
