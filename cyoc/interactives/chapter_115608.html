<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s Note: Just one shotting this, and I apologize for not looking at the previous interactives once before Eric got rubberized)<br />
<br />
Mike and Sei opened up the cylinders that contains the two villains as steam started to pour out of it and the two stumbled out in semi-harden blob-like shell of unknown substance and fell to the floor as their shell shattered and scattered to pieces on the floor as the three moved away from the sliding and/or flying shrapenel, exposing the people inside it. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; Johnny exclaimed. Mike and Sei look at each other confused at the two on the floor. One of them groans and slowly stumbles to his feet, naked as the other follows. Both of them look like they&#39;re Johnny&#39;s age, but a few feet taller and probably in their late twenties. The one on the right cupped his face with his right hand while his upper body limps like it is being hung in the air or that his body feels a bit heavy, still sluggish and dazed. His hair looks a little longer and the bangs are somewhat swept to the left. His body shape looks a little chubby, but not too obese while the other looks like an athlete on his left. The guy on the left had long hair and messy w/ a few bangs poking out in front of his forehead. He is also a few inches or a foot taller than him. The two of them finally look at each other in astonishment as realization came back to them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kayne?&quot; The guy on the right said. &quot;Yeah?&quot; he replied.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re back to normal right?&quot;<br />
Kayne nodded. They both sigh in relief and both hugged each other despite being naked and came another realization that they&#39;re naked and glanced down realizing their members were touching and stopped hugging and looked different ways, blushing. They then notice Johnny who is blushing at their naked bodies in front of them and the two Eric rubberized Mike and Sei flanking them on their left and right. And cupped their exposed areas and made an embarrassing smile. &quot;C-Can you... Find us some clothes?&quot; Kayne asked embarrassed about the situation. Johnny nodded and ordered both Mike and Sei to get them clothes as they fetched them from the closet filled w/ the victims&#39; clothes.<br />
<br />
Moments later, both Kayne and his buddy were finally clothed. Kayne wearing a dark green jacket w/ an under shirt  and a necklace. He also wears cargo pants w/ a wallet chain and running sneakers. Kayne&#39;s friend wears a vest and a long sleeved shirt and shorts and basketball shoes. &quot;Hey, thanks for returning us back to normal. My name is Kayne. And my close friend here is Rex.&quot; Kayne introduced themselves to Johnny, Mike, and Sei (and not directly, to Eric since he&#39;s just a rubber suit or skin for Mike and Sei). &quot;Uh, you&#39;re welcome... My name is Johnny, and this is Mike and Sei. And... Eric is their rubber skin or suit whatever.&quot; He then points to the rubber with human feet sticking out as he tries to break free. &quot;That there is my brother, Ryan. Apparently he&#39;s imprisoned and/or turning inside that hard solid rubber.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah... We were somewhat aware, but couldn&#39;t control our actions. Sorry.&quot; Rex apologized.<br />
&quot;Would you like to sit down Master Johnny&#39;s new friends?&quot; Mike asked. Both of them shook and looked back at Johnny. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you have lots of questions of what is going on huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
Kayne sighs and then tells them what happened days earlier before they were freed. There were investigating the mysterious disappearance of people in the town where Mike, Sei, Eric, Johnny and his brother lived in. They searched the town for a while before giving up. Almost declaring the case to be closed and unsolved, and report it back to their agent, they noticed two strange men going to the forest, carrying someone over their shoulder. Both Kayne and Rex soon followed at a distance till they went to the mansion. Once they went inside, they lost sight of the mysterious duo and their victims and split up, guns in their hands. As minutes pass, they bother were knocked out and the next thing they knew they were the next to turn. But instead, of the victims they recently brought and turned into some sort of rubbery object, they became the replicants of two evil doers as the other personality took over as their true personality were at the back of their mind. And the real villains left the scene as both personality jacked Kayne and Rex became decoys and continued their work for them. That continued for days on end until Johnny destroyed their clone shell and personality of the villains via shoved in the cylinder.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, there were others in here before us?&quot; Johnny asked in shock. Rex nods in reply, &quot;We couldn&#39;t count how many we&#39;ve done to these poor souls, but there was nothing we can do. Apparently, last thing we remember is that we were turning people into anonymous rubbery statues in the garden area.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think that sounds amazing!&quot; Sei said in amazement as Mike and Johnny glared at him as he winced as Mike apologized for Sei as they both bowed. &quot;Quit it you two.&quot; Johnny ordered in an annoyed tone as they both stopped bowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a way to turn your friends and your brother back to normal?&quot; Kayne ask Johnny.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I have to wait 24 hours to turn Eric back to normal and hopefully, my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex turns to Kayne, &quot;What should we do? We still need to find out who this guy and his partner is and the more we stay here, the trail will grow cold.&quot; Kayne ponders what are the options they have left. Apparently chasing seems somewhat out of the option, but even though the culprits managed to leave the mansion, there might be some remaining clues to find out where his next hideout will be at and finally put an end to this madness. There is also Mike, Sei, Eric and Ryan&#39;s situation of returning back to normal.<br />
&quot;Chasing the two culprits is out of the question; for now. But we can kill time by finding out what else is in this mansion and wait for the right time to return Johnny&#39;s friends to normal. It&#39;s the least we can do for now.&quot; Kayne decided. Both Sei and Mike were upset about their master and his friends choices of reversing the process, but they have no choice but to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are we gonna start looking first?&quot; Johnny asked.</p>
