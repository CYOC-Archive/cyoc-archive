<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were rather surprised by the victory, but pleased with it in a way that was more than just winning the game. The twists that were added was part of it, and you did enjoy Luna worshiping your feet as a reward for winning the game, but there were things that went beyond even that. It was very much the &quot;just have fun&quot; sort of thing that had you happy and also happy that Luna was happy. It made a part of you continue to wonder if this was what falling in love was like. You&#39;d grown up with stories from how your mom and dad fell in love and watched how your dad found love again with your stepmom after your biological mother&#39;s death. Luna, in the past, had told vague stories about how her mom and dad had fallen in love and were very close, though at the time she didn&#39;t reveal to you that her mom was the first MILF-wolf and the woman that you thought was Kellie&#39;s sister was actually Kellie&#39;s transformed husband. Still, all those stories carried a similar theme to them, and as you and Luna began cleaning up the Monopoly pieces to put the game away, you couldn&#39;t help but wonder if you and Luna were having your own version of those stories from family members and how they fell in love.<br />
<br />
As your transgender issues and self-conscious judging over your foot fetish had really prevented you from having any romantic adventures going through high school. There were girls that you got along with, as well as a few guys that were at least tolerant of you, but outside of Luna, you didn&#39;t have much in the way of a social life, and there, your friendship had been such that while a part of you had long thought about asking her out, you&#39;d never been brave enough to do it. Now things had changed drastically in becoming a MILF-wolf and learning that Luna had been a born MILF-wolf. It brought many of those things out, particularly when learning that Luna had sort of felt the same way about you. It had butterflies in your stomach as you looked to her and you felt better when she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... since you won, and enjoyed the twists you put into the game,&quot; Luna said as she lowered the lid over the rest of the box, &quot;I was thinking to add a surprise... not necessarily related to the game... but with the win and with things being quiet, it just feels right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A surprise?&quot; you asked as you followed Luna from the kitchen to the living room as Luna carried the Monopoly box.<br />
<br />
As the two of you entered, Luna approached a set of cabinets that were built into the wall underneath the stairs. It revealed a series of shelves that had all sorts of board games on them, though many of them were more adult themed, which you guessed was part of the fact that Luna had turned eighteen fairly recently and the board games she would have played as a little kid. Luna placed the Monopoly box on the top shelf and then went down to a lower shelf where there was something that looked like a specialized CD player and there was a wire that looked like it went up the back wall of the cabinet. Luna didn&#39;t immediately answer your question and you looked around to see a wire come down toward the entertainment center where there were a modest set of speakers on the top of it. The electric whirring of the device coming to life and the clicking of something plastic brought your attention back to Luna as she had the the player&#39;s &quot;door&quot; open and was placing a CD on the tray that extended from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a surprise,&quot; Luna then said to you as she looked up to you, &quot;and something that I&#39;d had in the back of my mind for something like this between you and me for many years. Regardless of whether you became a MILF-wolf or a regular werewolf... it would be something nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked on as Luna smiled as the tray pulled the CD in and then the door shut. She then pressed a button and you soon heard music play from the speakers across the room and Luna continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;But now it would link us together and give you something that I know you missed out on in high school,&quot; Luna said to you as she then stood up and lead you around the couch and into the open space between the couch and the entertainment center, &quot;would you like to dance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dance?&quot; you blinked, &quot;but I never learned...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I can teach you,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;and it&#39;ll be fun. Something we can do together... for romance and just being together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already love being with you,&quot; you told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the more reason to enjoy it,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;particularly as you&#39;ll also need to manage for the wedding. And you&#39;ll find it fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d make you look bad,&quot; you said back to her as Luna took one hand and placed it where a woman would normally hold onto a male partner. Luna then took on the role that one would normally assume from a male dance partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you won&#39;t,&quot; Luna assured you, &quot;and the learning won&#39;t hurt... and will be fun. I figured it&#39;d be a present surprise, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ll try,&quot; you said slowly, though Luna smiled as you said this.<br />
<br />
It was a bit of a surprise in that Luna had offered it. For she knew you&#39;d never had much of a &quot;social life&quot; that would have enabled you to learn how to dance beyond some awkward moves that one would see in a &quot;dance party&quot; video game. You&#39;d never been invited to the school dances where the girls asked the boys and you&#39;d been too afraid to jeopardize your friendship with Luna to ask her to things like the prom or anything like that. A part of you regretted not having the courage for it now, as you&#39;d learned that Luna had felt the same way about you as you did about her, perhaps even more. But there wasn&#39;t anything that could be done about that now, and as MILF-wolves, all that nervousness over what Luna felt was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just follow me,&quot; Luna instructed and step with me.<br />
<br />
Luna then started with a few slow steps and you followed, looking down between the deep valley between your generous breasts and Luna&#39;s to where your feet moved. It was something that had you stumble a bit as you got started, but Luna kept the movement slow and in time with the music. It was helped along that the music was fairly slow paced and that did help you catch up. After a few moments you noted Luna&#39;s lips pull into a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;See... it&#39;s working,&quot; Luna smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just trying not to fall down,&quot; you admitted as Luna moved to turn you both moving back toward the southern end of the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re making a good start,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;no stepping on my toes... though, remember, right now I am in the lead. You follow me and try to stay in step with me... otherwise you&#39;re doing great for a first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then continued forward and followed with the lesson. For a while, things remained a bit slower than the pacing of the music and Luna gave a few pointers here and there as the two of you moved along. You never stepped on her feet and as the two of you continued, with you following Luna, the points where you stumbled became less and less and the faster Luna was able to pick up the pace to keep time with the music. You got plenty of coaching on this and you did your best to keep up with them, and as you did so, you gained a bit more confidence in dancing with Luna. As that happened and you grew more confident and safe in the dance, you actually found yourself smiling and enjoying just being close to Luna. After a moment or two more, you cuddled against her as the two of you danced and rested your head on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Liking it?&quot; Luna asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m liking being with you,&quot; you answered, &quot;starting everything anew... being your mate, the &quot;father&quot; of our daughter, and just... well... being with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love being with you too,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;and we&#39;ll have a lifetime to love each other. And by the time of the wedding... you&#39;ll be a great dancer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; was all you could manage.</p>
