<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>My first time posting please let me know if you like it and I'll add more chapters. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">....one of those knee high athletic socks you see on soccer or baseball players. It was bright blue with bands of yellow at the top and some weird looking logo on it. <br />
<br />
Still disoriented by whatever Maria had blown in my face, I quickly grabbed the sock that used to be my briefs and ducked into a closet off the main hallway praying that Maria&#39;s husband wouldn&#39;t find me and beat me within an inch of my life. There in the dark closet I did my best to keep silent and motionless, even though was hard to focus and everything was a bit fuzzy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh  my poor bull&quot; I heard Maria say seductively. From the crack in the closet I could see Maria massaging her hands against Toro&#39;s broad shoulders trying to entice him into the bedroom to give me time to make my hasty exit without any further interaction from her musclebound husband. &quot;so stiff, maybe you could come to bedroom and I could help you relax&quot;<br />
<br />
Toro however was not playing along &quot;Ay woman you know I have practice in a few minutes and Hector is coming to pick me up.&quot; From my narrow vantage I watched as he got up brushing off Maria&#39;s hands and made his way into another room. <br />
<br />
Not one to waste a perfect opportunity, I began to slowly open the closet door but before I had even opened it an inch, I was hit by a wave of dizziness. I fell backward and bumped against the wall of the closet with an audible thud dropping the blue athletic sock. Oh shit, I thought to myself, Toro would have to have been deaf to not have heard that. But even as visions of Toro ripping me out of the closet to break various bones in my body flashed before my eyes, everything around me seemed to lurch up and get bigger. After a few seconds of disorientation, I realized they weren&#39;t getting bigger I was getting smaller!<br />
<br />
The waves of dizziness accelerated taking with them my height. Inch by inch I continued to shrink.  I tried to get up and open the closet door but fell back again thudding again against the wall of the closet. I didn&#39;t even care that about Toro or my imminent beating, I just wanted to get out of there.  I reached again for the door handle but it was just out of reach, I was barely two foot tall now and still shrinking. <br />
<br />
Falling back against some shoes, I felt the ground shake with the dull thud of heavy footsteps. &quot;What was that?&quot; Toro exclaimed &quot;Did you hear that? It sounded like it was coming from the closet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear anything&quot; Maria replied, I could hear just a bit of worry in her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I swear I heard something&quot; He replied as I heard both his voice and footsteps get closer to the closet. <br />
<br />
I was a little more than a foot tall now, realizing now that powder that Maria had blown on me was probably responsible for my new size. She must have figured it would be easier to hide me at 20 inches tall than as a full grown man. I scanned the dark closet desperate to find something to hide. There were a few pair of what I assume were Maria&#39;s shoes all too small for me to fit in even at my diminished size. Then I saw them, my salvation, a pair of humongous soccer cleats, they had to be at least size sixteen. As I got close the scent was overwhelming, a rank mix of dried sweat and leather soaked deeply into these worn cleats, but given my limited options, I held my nose and crawled in pulling myself into a tight ball just under the tongue.<br />
<br />
Hiding there in the shoe a new tingling sensation overtook my body. Oh lord what now, I thought to myself praying that I wouldn&#39;t get any smaller. How would Maria even find me if I was barely bigger than an ant. The tingling intensified in my arms and legs, it felt like electricity was running down them. I would have cried out but my body was paralyzed, I felt them contract, shrinking and pulling into my torso bit by bit till they were completely gone. The tingling sensation was making me weirdly aroused. My cock was rock hard, in any other situation I would have been rather proud of its stiffness. It felt harder and longer than it ever had before. But the feeling was short lived, I felt the tingling intensify in my privates, first against my balls causing them to pull up into me, then it spread going up my shaft shrinking my cock bit by bit till nothing was left.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t even have a minute to mourn my lost manhood, as I felt the tingling spread up my neck to my head, I felt my head pull into my body. As with my other extremities, the transformation moved bit by bit I, first my neck, then my chin, then my lips, nose till the transformation got up to my eyes and the world turned black. <br />
<br />
I felt my body shift and change, stretching and flattening into a new shape, I felt my insides hollow out and my skin change into something else. My senses returned to me changed, blended together into one and somehow even more sensitive than they were before.  I could see, hear, smell and feel all around me tasting and smelling the Toro&#39;s cleat as if I was licking the dried sweat and leather while inhaling deep the musky odor. While it had been unbearable before, now the aroma of Toro&#39;s cleats was weirdly appealing. I had no idea what my new shape was, I couldn&#39;t move or see in the dim light of the closet. <br />
<br />
The transformation had seemed to take an eternity but must have been only a few seconds, as only a few moments after the tingling had stopped, I &quot;saw&quot; the door of the closet open and saw Toro&#39;s now gigantic face looking down at me. He was tan with short stubble and a strong square jaw that highlighted his masculine features with the glint of gold from his nosering. As he opened the closet wider I saw the rest of him, true to his name he stood at least 6 and a half feet tall and was pure muscle. Whatever I was now I prayed that he would not be able to find me. He looked around the closet confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Di..did you find anything in there&quot; Maria stuttered nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, something must have fallen or something in here. But I did find my cleats&quot; A sense of dread fell upon me as he lifted me up and out of the cleats &quot;What&#39;s this&quot; He said pulling me out of the shoe. He held me up in front of him, I felt my body unfurl and dangle between his two fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria....come here&quot; He shouted he said gripping me in his fist. I felt my whole body collapse tighten in his hand. Oh shit I thought to myself he knows. I caught a glance of mirror in the hallway, in the reflection Toro held in his hand an exact match for the blue and yellow athletic sock that my briefs had turned into. Wait I thought to myself, if he had a sock in his hand where was I, it took a second to register, but then I understood....I had been transformed into the sock. <br />
<br />
Waving me at her Toro asked &quot;Maria where is my other sock, I thought you washed both of them, I need them for practice tonight&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Maria&#39;s entire face relaxed in relief. &quot;Estupido they are right here&quot; grabbing the sock that used to be my briefs from the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mi amor&quot; He said kissing her. &quot;Shoot, I&#39;m going to be late for practice.&quot; He hurried grabbing the other sock out of her hand and cramming it and me into his cleat. &quot;Now I just need my gym bag.&quot; He said dropping us off on a chair. <br />
<br />
Maria quickly bent down and in a very low whisper &quot;Sorry about this, it was the only thing I could think of to hide you. I forgot he had practice today. Don&#39;t worry as soon and he brings you home I&#39;ll turn you back&quot;. <br />
<br />
Scant seconds later I felt myself lifted up and jammed into some sort of bag, jostling as Toro made his way down the stairs.</p>
