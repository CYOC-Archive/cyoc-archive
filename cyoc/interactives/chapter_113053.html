<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jason was sprouting fur and dumbing down, Tom himself had been having a weird day. All throughout class, his body had been itching like crazy. At first, the itch had only been in his armpits and legs but by the last two periods, the sensation had spread to his entire body. Furthermore, it felt like his mom had shrunk his underwear in the wash.<br />
<br />
His underwear felt extremely tight around his manhood. It was a foreign sensation as Tom wasn’t very well-endowed. Finally, the school bell rang, signalling the end of the all lessons. Tom hurriedly packed up and left. He had to get home and find out what exactly was happening to him. <br />
<br />
As he walked by Mr Jack Wilson’s table, he noticed the obese teacher staring sympathetically at him while seemingly unconsciously rubbing the vast, hairy expanse of his manhood in front of him. Mr Wilson had been acting really weird that day, especially when he had handed Tom the cup of water.<br />
<br />
What was up with that? No teacher had ever given Tom a glass of water for no reason before. Tom shook his head and pushed the thoughts out of his mind. Enough of that, he had to get to the bottom of his itch. Was he coming down with some sort of virus perhaps?<br />
<br />
The itching continued throughout Tom’s walk home, but it was only when he had reached his bedroom that he felt the sensation increase severely in his pits. He stuck his right hand underneath his t-shirt and began to scratch his left pit like crazy. He suddenly noticed that he was scratching a lot of hair. Tom frowned in confusion.<br />
<br />
He took off his t-shirt and gasped. He had thick messy bushes of brown hair sticking out of each pit. Tom cringed. His pit hair was wild and bushy. But that wasn’t all, there was a patch of curly hair in the middle of his chest and the rest of his torso was covered in little brown hairs that were growing by the minute. <br />
<br />
Tom whipped off his shorts and stared at his manhood. His briefs hadn’t shrunk at all. It was actually his package that had grown. It was huge! It looked like he had stuffed a sausage and two lemons in them. Tom quickly took off his briefs too, before his massive cock ripped it to shreds.<br />
<br />
Tom continued his inspection of his body. Apart from legs that were as hairy as his pits, nothing else had changed. He breathed a sigh of relief. Now, if only he could get rid of all this hair.<br />
<br />
While Tom was looking at his hairy legs, the ‘jock water’ Jack gave him was was about to finish its work by enlarging his balls even more. Then, Tom’s balls would be able to produce its own testosterone and change Tom into a total jock.<br />
<br />
As Tom ran his fingers through the incredibly thick hair on his legs, he felt a tingling sensation in his groin. Blood rushed to his cock and it slowly fattened up to its full size. He gasped when he felt a sharp pain in his balls as they expanded dropped lower. They were now about the size of grapefruits and were covered in brown hair. <br />
<br />
Tom groaned at the pleasurable sensations rushing through his body and was a bit shocked to find that his voice had deepened. He instinctively wrapped his hand around his cock and began to jack off. He noticed that his arms were considerably more beefy than before. Tom also noted that his arms were covered in thick brown curls, much more manly than his previous nerdy arms.<br />
<br />
He groaned once more, also noting that his voice had continued to drop. <br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Tom moaned out loud. “What’s happening to me? Why can’t I stop?”</p>
