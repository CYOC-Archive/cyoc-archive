<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaiden woke up in Jace’s arms, remembering the countless times they had done the deed the night before. Actually, he had lost count, but he knew it wasn’t quite enough to keep Derrick as Jace’s cock forever. Judging by the sounds from the room next door, Paul and Ryan were well on their way to making Tyler a permanent feature of Ryan’s body before they too had fallen asleep. He didn’t know what Duncan and Wade were doing; he had given them his room for the night. He wondered if they would join the Beta frat too, or if they would want to flee the country after last night’s debacle.<br />
<br />
Kaiden left the bed, managing not to wake Jace, and headed back down to the basement. Hidden in the access to the heater were the clothes and other effects of the dicked Alphas. He went through their wallets, separating their money and cutting up their cards and IDs. Next, he went through their phones, surprised to find only one of them was smart enough to have a passcode set. Going through their information yielded nothing of value, and even their social media accounts were relatively clean. Arrogant and skeevy, but nothing illegal. He didn’t find the video from last night on the three unlocked phones, which meant there was only one possibility, and he felt like there might be more than one piece of damning evidence on the device. He tried a couple obvious guesses, but stopped before the phone locked him out and wiped its contents.<br />
<br />
“I see you’ve already started,” Duncan said quietly as he came down the stairs. “How do you do this?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, well, I just kind of concentrate on who I want to—“<br />
<br />
“No, no, I mean how do you do THIS,” he said, pointing towards the piles of clothes. “How do you live with dicking people? How can you be so nonchalant about what’s basically murder?”<br />
<br />
“Look, Duncan,” Kaiden started, not sure how to say what he needed to. “I’m not okay with this, y’know, in and of itself. But those guys...they’re monsters. The first one I dicked threatened Jace and I with slashing our tires and getting us kicked out of college. And that’s not just empty threats. Those Alphas have some kind of sway in this town: nobody stands up to them, not the school, not professors, not even the police. Jared was blackmailing me into sucking his dick when I...when I first figured out I could do this.”<br />
<br />
He paused, reading the shock and conflict in Duncan’s face. He was abhorred with the Alphas too, but he still didn’t think dicking them was right. <br />
<br />
“Duncan, I understand. This isn’t right. But what other choice do we have? Do we just let them continue to rape and abuse everyone they come across? They were going to blackmail all of us, rape Jessica and that other girl, and possibly even shoot us! They have no fear, they have to be stopped. But you’re right. I don’t want to dick anyone else. If we can get into Luke’s phone, I think we can put an end to this.”<br />
<br />
“Luke...” Duncan repeated slowly, Kaiden realizing that the 10-inch beast now hanging from Duncan’s crotch must be Luke. “I...I can still hear him...begging.”<br />
<br />
“Tell him,” Kaiden said, realizing how he would get into this phone, “tell him we’ll let him go if he gives us the password.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll let him go?! But what if he reports us?”<br />
<br />
“First of all, who’s going to believe him? ‘I got kidnapped and turned into a penis!’ No one will believe him. But secondly,” he moved in, whispering in Duncan’s ear, not sure whether Luke could still hear as a cock, “we’re not going to release him.”<br />
<br />
Duncan’s eyes went wider, but he nodded in understanding. This was it, this was the end of the Alphas. And they all had to be in on it. Duncan focused on talking to Luke through their mental bond, clearly finding it hard to focus as his Luke-penis went fully erect at the prospect of being released. Then, Duncan turned to Kaiden.<br />
<br />
“2367,” he said simply. <br />
<br />
Kaiden unlocked the phone and found exactly what he was looking for. Videos of every pledge raping their first girl, their first guy, their twentieth...but there was more. A secret group chat confirmed who was responsible for firebombing Jace’s car, and who they were planning on targeting next. Photos of professors in compromising situations, cell numbers for local cops and politicians with the note “frat brother”. Luke, as the second oldest member of the frat, had everything locked away on his phone. They had been careful to cover identities in the videos other than the pledge, but last night was different. Jessica barging in on them put them off their game, because the video picked up right at the beginning.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m all set, just tell me when to start filming.”<br />
<br />
“Wait until he&#39;s inside the girl. The tapes can&#39;t show Tyler&#39;s size or else Kyle will get us all kicked out.”<br />
<br />
“How long have the Alpha&#39;s been doing this?”<br />
<br />
“Since the frat was founded in the 70&#39;s. EVERY single Alpha has been on tape fucking a roophied girl. Recorded proof for our brothers that they take what they want, and meet all the requirements of being a true ALPHA. Once an Alpha, always an alpha.”<br />
<br />
This was it. The video that would put an end to the Alphas and blow this whole thing wide open. Duncan realized the gravity of the evidence in front of them.<br />
<br />
“You’re right, Kaiden. These guys have to be stopped. Let’s get rid of these; then we can find a way to get this video out there without linking it to us.”<br />
<br />
That was the day everything changed. The news aired the story as Jessica called out the frat, keeping to her story that the Alphas had roofied her sorority sister, and threatened her at gunpoint when she barged in. Multiple witnesses corroborated that the four had been seen taking a girl upstairs before the gunshots, but hadn’t been seen leaving. Kelly, the girl who had been drugged, named the four guys involved, but didn’t remember anything after being knocked out. Jessica said they dropped the gun and fled out the window. The fingerprints on the gun were Derrick’s. The whole case would have been open and shut, if not for the fact that none of the four boys could be found. The Alphas denied the claims fruitlessly, and their insistence that their frat brothers had gone missing were taken as evidence that they were hiding from the law. <br />
<br />
The Alphas started losing power on campus. Nobody put up with their shit anymore, other than the ones who they already had dirt on. Then the videos were released. An anonymous account traced outside the country, listing every member of the frat and linking their name to either a video, a phot, or a text that implicated them in serious crimes. But most of all, the video from that night, revealing that the frat had been doing these horrendous acts since their inception. Everyone who had ever been a frat brother or an initiate was suddenly under investigation. Countless people were kicked out of office, fired, and prosecuted. <br />
<br />
All except the four responsible. They weren’t Alphas anymore. They were nothing but meat swinging between the legs of four Betas. They were never found, and they never would be. Kaiden stayed with his new brothers for the rest of the year, enjoying his pick between five massive cocks eager to repay him for their gift. He ended up settling down with Jace, who accepted his new sexuality eagerly. And the book...well, it was lost in the Beta house, destined to reappear one day when it was needed again.</p>
