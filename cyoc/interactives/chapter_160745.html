<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hopefully it’s some good news,” said Pam.<br />
<br />
The news anchors were seated behind the desk as normal.  One of them was instantly recognizable, though her appearance had clearly changed.  She looked about 10-15 years younger.  Her face lacked any wrinkles or lines and her hair seemed to have a brighter sheen.  Most noticeably her breasts were firm, pert and uncovered.  I assumed she must be fully nude as well, though that was impossible to tell because of the desk.<br />
<br />
As for her co-anchor, well, she was a new face.  Literally.  This new woman was obviously the formerly male co-anchor of this particular news program.  Her face was still changing and there were still remnants of maleness present.  Her face, and I had to remind myself to use “her” instead of “him,” seemed to have changed as much as mine.  Otherwise she was now completely female.  I assumed, again, since the desk was in the way.  But she was definitely topless and also sported a pretty nice set of breasts.<br />
<br />
The newly transformed anchor said, “As this extraordinary weekend of radical changes draws to a close, we want to take you now to a live address from the President of the United States.”  I found it interesting that she spoke with the same cadence and word choice that she utilized when she was a male.  That was something that hadn’t changed with me, Scott or Vanessa, either.<br />
<br />
“So much for hoping for good news,” said Rachel.  That made all of us laugh.<br />
<br />
The camera changed to a shot of the Oval Office.  Behind the desk sat a truly interesting figure.  Instead of the previous figure that everyone had come to know so well, there now sat a young woman who didn’t appear any older than early-30’s.  Her hair extended down so far that the bottom of it was obscured by the desk, but it still had that unmistakable hue.  Her skin color was also instantly recognizable.  It seemed that even with this change, she was using an “enhancement,” as it were.<br />
<br />
“Are you fucking kidding me?” exclaimed Rachel.<br />
<br />
“What?” the rest of us asked in unison.<br />
<br />
She answered, “Look at those fucking things!”<br />
<br />
We all knew right away she was referring to the president’s new breasts.  Rachel’s exclamation was warranted.  The president had two breasts that were massive.  They were obviously bigger than any of ours.  Even though she sat at the desk with her arms on top of the desk directly in front of the camera’s shot of her breasts, they were not fully obscured.  It wasn’t just the size that made Rachel exclaim, however.<br />
<br />
“Are…those…real?” I asked with shock.<br />
<br />
Joyce replied, “They sure don’t look like it.  I’ve seen plenty of fake tits in my time, and those sure as shit look fake.”<br />
<br />
“Well how can that be?” asked Vanessa.  “He couldn’t have had surgery today!”<br />
<br />
I was pretty mystified myself.  Rachel and I exchanged a quick glance.  “How could someone’s ‘physical prime’ mean fake tits?” I asked.  I honestly hoped the ring would give me some kind of an epiphany so I knew the answer.  No such luck.  I guess I’d have to wish for that later.<br />
<br />
“Would you all shut up, so we hear what he’s saying!” interrupted Scott.<br />
<br />
“She, not he,” I corrected him.<br />
<br />
“Shh!” Scott answered without looking at me.<br />
<br />
We missed hearing the president’s first few remarks, but they all seemed to be pretty introductory.  “By now, the whole world has undergone some big changes.  Big changes, some might say the biggest change ever,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Typical,” I muttered to myself.  Once again, I noticed, there was no change to the cadence, tone or word choice of the person speaking.<br />
<br />
The president continued, “I want to assure you that me and my administration are committed to leading America through this extraordinary period and we will continue to be the greatest country in the world.”  I rolled my eyes.  She didn’t seem to have changed much beyond her appearance.  <br />
<br />
Our newly female president continued to ramble for a few minutes before she got to the purpose of her address, which was basically just to reiterate things we’d already heard during the day.  She mentioned the overturn on nudity bans, but now she also encouraged states to make sure they passed similar laws so there would be no issues.  She spoke about working with companies to make sure we didn’t have sudden, vast unemployment issues.  She mentioned that “something” was being worked on regarding how humanity would be able to survive in an all-female world, but didn’t want to get into specifics.  I honestly couldn’t tell if that was because she knew of something that was legitimately being worked on, or if she was just making it up.<br />
<br />
The most interesting part of the address was when she stood up at the desk to reveal that she was fully nude and that she, too, was completely female except for the finishing changes to her face.  She then had the vice president and some other people from the administration come on camera with her.  They, too, were nearly fully changed and were all fully nude.  I was genuinely surprised to see a smile on the vice president’s face.  I would have guessed that he would not have been happy about changing.<br />
<br />
The address ended without any new information being mentioned.  I became a little concerned that perhaps my wish had outstretched the ring’s powers.  “That was a whole lot of nothing,” said Pam.<br />
<br />
“Some things haven’t changed,” said Joyce.<br />
<br />
The day was fast drawing to a close.  Our changes were almost complete.  Rachel still hadn’t let on to Pam, Scott and Vanessa what she and Joyce wanted to do.  We weren’t quite ready for that just yet.<br />
<br />
“Dinner time,” I said as I headed to the kitchen.</p>
