<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The group began walking aimlessly, the whole world suddenly opened up to them in an instant and they had the open beers in public to prove it. It was such a flex! &quot;So what&#39;s next?&quot; Brian asked, &quot;we can literally do anything! Hey Dave! Am I a multi-millionaire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam inhaled sharply, immediately on edge from the potential of such a wide and sweeping change to reality, David let out a chuckle, &quot;I don&#39;t think so... Just drink your beer and enjoy right now, we have plenty of time to tailor our lives.&quot; Sam relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what would make tonight more fun, or what have you wanted to do that you couldn&#39;t?&quot; David asked no one in particular.<br />
<br />
Brian was struggling to reign his thoughts in from world domination, Sam piped up, &quot;There&#39;ve been some movies I was interested in that my parents wouldn&#39;t let me see...&quot; Brian scoffed at the comment, &quot;You&#39;re so limited Sam!&quot; &quot;Yeah, well, you&#39;re so unhinged!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, calm down! Sam, of the movies that you were interested in, you&#39;ve seen as much as you wanted to. If it scared you or grossed you out or bored you, you skipped that part. Same for Brian and I.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brian stopped walking suddenly and the pair turned back to check on him. he had a half smirk with wide eyes and a far away look, &quot;You good Bri?&quot; David asked. &quot;Guys!&quot; he whispered. &quot;I have seen so much porn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; the others responded with an eyeroll. &quot;We don&#39;t want to think about that! Perv.&quot; Sam commented.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a prude!&quot; Brian retorted.<br />
&quot;I am not, I want sex.&quot; Sam finished hesitantly.<br />
&quot;Well, then tonight you&#39;ll get some!&quot; David interjected confidently. The beer going straight to his head.<br />
&quot;No no no no no, take that back, I&#39;m not ready!&quot; Sam said with rising panic.<br />
&quot;See, prude.&quot; Brian smirked.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re more than ready, It&#39;s going to be the best 25 minutes of your life, so far.&quot; David said exchanging a glance with Brian.<br />
&quot;I guess you&#39;re right. I guess I&#39;m just nervous I&#39;ll mess something up.&quot; Sam said as his emotions shifted from panic to acceptance, into hesitant excitement.<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen, You&#39;re going to finish that beer. As soon as you do, the most attractive person to you is going to approach you, tell you they want you, you&#39;re going to follow them, and the both of you will have the most mind blowing sex and orgasms either of you have ever had. Nothing will happen that will embarrass either of you. You will please them in ways neither of you knew were possible, and they will do the same to you. When you&#39;re done, they will leave happy with no expectations, you&#39;ll catch up with us immediately, and we will have another drink to celebrate.&quot; David smirked at the rabid envy rapidly forming on Brian&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Sam, now eager for his first sexual encounter instead of hesitant, slammed his drink back and chugged the last half of his beer. On cue, a stunning person in their 20&#39;s appeared, &quot;Hey handsome. Follow me and I&#39;ll...&quot; they leaned close to Sam&#39;s ear and whispered. the thought of it alone made Sam drop his plastic cup, &quot;S-see you later guys, I gotta go!&quot;<br />
<br />
David picked up Sam&#39;s trash with a huge grin on his face, &quot;Okay, do me next!&quot; Brian said watching the pair disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what do you wan...&quot; &quot;SEX!&quot; Brian interjected.<br />
David scowled, &quot;You&#39;ll get that plenty of times throughout your life, we all will... but tonight is Sam&#39;s night and we don&#39;t want to take that from him by us all having the same experience, right? Besides, it would be rude of you both to left me to rule the universe alone, you&#39;d have no idea what I&#39;d get up to in your absence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, but what are we gonna do while we wait for Sam to get back?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first, you&#39;re gonna tell me about a recent time your feelings were hurt or you were treated different because you were too young.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian blushed, and told the story of his cousin&#39;s wedding earlier this summer. There was nobody near Brian&#39;s age, he tried to congregate with the men and spend time near his father but when the group went outside to smoke, he was told by his dad to stay inside and play with the children, he felt humiliated.<br />
<br />
David considered that every statement Brian made this evening was toward hedonistic indulgence. The beer was his idea, he was focused on sex, he scoffed that David set them up to be able to let loose &quot;only&quot; tonight, and now he&#39;s talking about being excluded from smoking. <br />
<br />
Feeling confident he knew what Brian wanted he reimagined the whole scene as well as everything leading up to it. &quot;So you&#39;re telling me, we&#39;re smoking cigars now because you went to a wedding where you and all the men were given one. You were one of just a few guys who knew what to do with it. You showed all the men including your Dad how to prepare and smoke the cigar, and were treated like an adult by everyone there. That&#39;s quite a story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian shifted his feet and puffed the cigar that appeared in his hand. &quot;It really is, I&#39;m shocked my dad didn&#39;t kill me on the spot, or my mom as soon as she found out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you spent the night drinking and toward the end of the reception you had an experience just like Sam is having now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it was... mind blowing.&quot; Brian got a stupid goofy smile as he recounted the experience.<br />
<br />
David hesitated, he didn&#39;t want to change his friend in any permanent way, or his friends&#39; family dynamic but did want to make him feel respected. &quot;But your parents were okay when you were sent home with a few extra cigars, and now you&#39;re sharing your last one with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, its not fun doing it alone. I guess that&#39;s why they had it at the wedding, it&#39;s a social thing, and why I brought one for y... Wait a minute...&quot; Brian muttered.<br />
<br />
David snickered as Brian&#39;s histories collided. &quot;Wow, you changed everything that happened to me at a wedding over a month ago,&quot; Brian marveled, &quot;and the things that happened since then.&quot;</p>
