<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melvin Qvite, Horizon’s CEO, was fairly nervous as he made his way up toward the podium area on Skull Island, or Dinotopia Aquatica, and noted that things were set up for a small and modest announcement. Of course in many ways it wasn&#39;t exactly a small announcement either, given the nature of things. For the announcement was largely a formality to announce that the Dinotopian Covid 19 Vaccine was finished and would be ready for a requisition to get it approved for distribution. Present with him on the stage were the doctors and scientists that worked for Horizon on the Dinotopian version of the vaccine and Molly, the first Animalian to catch Covid 19 and the one without which the present vaccine wouldn&#39;t be possible.<br />
<br />
He had hopes that things would be ready for this earlier in the year, and in theory the testing on the vaccine with the Dinotopians on Skull Island had showed good results that played to the scientific skill that his scientists had. However, he also found as things moved forward into January that more state and local politics got into the mix. Many states were putting medical workers and the elderly at the top of the list of people to get the Covid vaccines, but all Animalians were either very young to adults in their prime, the equal of those in their twenties or thirties. Thus while there were Animalians that technically were old enough to qualify, their regained youth removed their eligibility under many of these state laws and plans, particularly when no Animalian had died as a result of contracting Covid 19. The only one who met these criteria was a female Maisaura Dinotopian who worked as a nurse at Horizon Light in Lyre. This then got the states arguing with him.<br />
<br />
And some of these were silly arguments in the first place. Neither the Dinotopian Covid Vaccine that was now ready nor the mundane Animalian Vaccine that was still in development could be taken by Humans, and the Dinotopian population was small enough that Horizon&#39;s vaccine wouldn&#39;t effect the state&#39;s efforts to vaccinate the Human population. It was only now in March as many schools were letting out for Spring Break and states like Florida were opening up their beaches and other recreational places for these college students that Florida&#39;s governor modified the rules that related to Animalians. He told Melvin Qvite it was because Animalians weren&#39;t competing with Humans for the vaccine doses, but Melvin didn&#39;t quite believe him. Though there was a lot that had to be done carefully as the governor had sent people to represent him and be present for the announcement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to thank you for participating in all of this,&quot; Melvin said politely to Molly, who stood quietly on the podium nearby and her eyes focused out on the reporters that were gathering on one of the open areas on top of Skull Island.<br />
<br />
It was a relatively nice day, was rather warm, and with the sun shinning on all of them. It gave all of them a warm view of the land and city near the Animalian Colony on their western side and the open expanse of the Atlantic to the east. It was weather that would normally be great for Spring Break, which is what Melvin figured was the Florida governor&#39;s actual reason for opening up the Dinotopian Covid vaccine in his state so that the Dinotopians, many of whom had positions as life guards and to at least drive sharks away from the beaches where swimmers were, could fill those rolls without the sorts of hassles that hurt the state of Florida the previous year.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem mister...&quot; Molly began before slowing to try and pronounce the Horizon CEO&#39;s last name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Qvite,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;Ku-vai-tuh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Qvite,&quot; Molly then made a small smile, &quot;and it&#39;s no problem. I&#39;d hope to be able to not only show that the vaccine for Dinotopians will work but give people assurances that all the vaccines will work. It&#39;ll help everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can only hope that works,&quot; Melvin returned the smile, &quot;Hopefully...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then looked down to his watch and noted the time was approaching eleven AM and the start of the press conference that was to serve as the announcing of the Dinotopian Covid Vaccine being ready. Melvin approached the podium and then tapped on the microphone with one finger. It gave a dull &quot;thump&quot; and a &quot;squeak&quot; as he did so, but it was enough for him to see that it was on. It also served to draw the gathered press who took photos, aimed video cameras, or readied means to record what would be said next, be it by recorder or by written notes. Melvin swallowed and then began to speak calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the press and thank you for coming for this special announcement,&quot; Melvin spoke, &quot;as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been aware of Horizon&#39;s connections with Animalia and its colonies. It was our experiments that resulted in Animalia&#39;s birth and the largely positive change that their community has created for the world. Offering people new shots at life, new career options, and perhaps something that is most needed in the world... the ability to be resist going to extremes over any perceived slight. Something that everyone can learn from...&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused for a moment as a few flashbulbs went off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Particularly in the wake of the trials of the past year, particularly coming from the Covid 19 pandemic,&quot; Melvin continued, &quot;which proved it could infect Animalians, both those who were converted Humans or uplifted mundane animals. While Animalia has been spared the fatalities that have hurt so many around the world, that hasn&#39;t changed the infectious nature of the disease and the need for various companies to produce vaccines to counter the disease. And I would like to thank officials from the various companies for the help they provided Horizon regarding samples and other material needed to develop the first vaccine for Animalians that is now ready for distribution, pending approval of that distribution.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin then turned and gestured with his free hand for Molly and then for the doctors that had been working at the hospital/lab that was part of Dinotopia Aquatica to come forward. They slowly did so, while Molly gave a small wave.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while we wish the path to the present vaccine wouldn&#39;t have started with Animalia&#39;s first Covid 19 case,&quot; Melvin continued, &quot;we can be thankful for her strength and courage to not only power through the disease but help Horizon&#39;s staff build on what tips and advice they&#39;d gotten on the nature of Covid 19 and thus develop the present Dinotopian Covid 19 Vaccine that is now ready for distribution and will be distributed once all formal health approvals are made. It will be a two shot dose, and which our lab tests have proven to be highly effective at preventing at least the worst of the symptoms and thus assuring that the Dinotopians will be free from worrying over the effects of this disease.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said Dinotopian... what about other Animalians?&quot; a question came from one of the gathered reporters.<br />
<br />
&quot;At present the team working in Wisconsin and with some lab tests in Lyre are still working on the vaccine for other Animalians,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;as we reported at the time, tests on cell samples indicated the Dinotopian vaccine would not respond well to more Animalians based on more modern animals. Given the conditions they have to deal with, they are about on schedule with what we expected for the completion of that vaccine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is the present plan with regard to the Dinotopian vaccine?&quot; came another question, &quot;would it it be safe for Humans to take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At present, tests would indicate that the Dinotopian Vaccine wouldn&#39;t be safe to distribute to Humans,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;which I can turn over to our scientists to handle those questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin stepped back and let one of the doctors that had worked with Molly to help develop the present Dinotopian vaccine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much of the answer relates to the interaction of the vaccine with the Animalia Virus that is present in all Animalians, regardless of whether or not they&#39;ve been vaccinated to keep the Animalia Virus inactive,&quot; the scientist spoke, &quot;and because of the special alterations that Horizon made to produce the Dinotopian strands of the Animalia Virus, the Dinotopian Covid 19 Vaccine ultimately carries some of those same modifications since the one we had to help develop the vaccine is a Dinotopian herself. In this, it would be unsafe to administer the Dinotopian Vaccine to anyone that isn&#39;t a Dinotopian based on how it reacts to the Animalia Virus as well. In this from a medical point of view, it would be safe for us at Horizon to vaccinate the Dinotopians here at Skull Island and at Dino City as they would match the genetic criteria needed to take that vaccine. And because it cannot be taken by Humans or even other Animalians, we are not in direct competition with the other companies that have produced Covid Vaccines for Humans. In this, Animalia and the Dinotopians in particular are outside the main supply chain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is partially what has enabled us to be ready to work with the state governments to allow for all Dinotopians to get their first shot as soon as they can,&quot; Melvin spoke up as he returned to the podium, &quot;they&#39;ll be administered at Horizon facilities, given that Dinotopians are presently the most limited to Animalia&#39;s colonies, there shouldn&#39;t be any problem in the distribution. We will start here in Dinotopia Aquatica, should she be quick and then move on to Dino City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What on the reports that more people might wish to become Dinotopians?&quot; another reporter asked, &quot;particularly now that places like Dino City have been built?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The present hope is to have a good stockpile of the Dinotopian Vaccine,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;partially as we are not sure as to how effective the vaccine will be over time... as this could be a yearly vaccine that would need to be renewed. And in this, it would fall under the standard policies that Horizon has regarding the production of the vaccine regarding the Animalia Virus to assure that new Animalians aren&#39;t a risk to convert those that do not wish to convert. And so far, we&#39;ve managed to meet those needs very well. The Dinotopian vaccine should be no different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if they make requests for conversion to become Dinotopians in a way that outpaces your policies?&quot; the reporter repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because gaining the fossil DNA can be more difficult and time consuming, that may not be a problem,&quot; Melvin replied, &quot;and they would still have to complete the required studies and courses required by law to prepare them to deal with any and all expected animal instincts, which even if they become a Dinotopian we already have the fossil DNA for, there would be time to make sure that there would be Dinotopian strains of the vaccine ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about questions that this would allow people to cheat when there are so many Humans that haven&#39;t been vaccinated and aren&#39;t even eligible to be vaccinated in their states?&quot; came the next question.<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be a concern if we were still dealing with the situation as it was late last year and at the start of the year,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;by now the situation has changed in that there are more vaccines available for Humans than before, the production is increasing, and the thing that is really slowing things down is more in relation to people refusing to get vaccinated, regardless of whether or not it is there turn. That would be the bigger issue to handle. For if someone who is presently qualified for the vaccine refuses to get it... are we to then deny everyone else because someone refuses to take the vaccine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that with all these Spring Break groups coming, those of us Dinotopians that are tasked with assuring that their time in the water is safe,&quot; Molly spoke up as she approached the podium, &quot;or saving them should they end up in a situation where they need to be rescued... we would like some assurance that we will be protected should they be carrying it in. Just as happened in the spikes last year.&quot;</p>
