<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken smirks, enjoying the power he now possess, ‘if this works, I can finally show everyone what their true purpose is and help them reach their full potential,’ he thinks to himself, “before we start, Jeff, do you remember the time I told you that I am a Furry?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I was shocked when I learned about it,” Jeff says, “I mean… Furries are so creepy… I am convinced that they are just a bunch of pedophiles!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I remember your reaction,” Ken says, feeling rage raise in him by being called a “pedophile”, but he manages to keep his cool, “I told you then, and I’ll tell you once again that we Furries are NO pedophiles!”<br />
<br />
“That’s what you claim,” Jeff says, “but you and your… kind can’t hide your true nature! Only pedophiles hug children… I bet you even fucked a few in the past!”<br />
<br />
“I have not, but you seem to not want to believe it,” Ken says, he then grins, “so, instead trying to convince you… I’ll simply SHOW you!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t think about making me come to one of your sick pedo-parties,” Jeff growls.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “oh, you WILL come,” he says, “however… hehe… not as yourself”.<br />
<br />
Jeff narrows his eyes, “what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“My persona is a lizard with orange scales with black stripes, kinda like a tiger, and he has blue slitted eyes,” Ken says, his grin widens, “you know, I’ve always dreamed of owning a costume, so I can BE my lizard-self”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen when he realizes what Ken is planning, “NO! NO WAY IN HELL!”<br />
<br />
Ken simply grins wider, “strip,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified when he feels his arms move on their own, obeying Ken, as they begin taking his clothes off, soon Jeff is standing naked in front of his friend.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, “well, the ladies won’t miss anything,” he says as he looks at Jeff’s cock, “however, your cock can stay… for now at least”.<br />
<br />
“K-Ken… please… I… I’m sorry,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, “you are not sorry, Jeff, you are just trying to convince me to not punish you for being such an intolerant asshole,” he says, the teen snorts, his smirk growing, “you are so pathetic. Let’s continue, next your skin will become spandex and your hair will vanish, leaving you bold!”<br />
<br />
Jeff shivers when a tingling runs through his body as Ken’s command takes effect, the teen can only watch himself in the reflection of the full length mirror on his wardrobe and feel as his skin starts to feel like spandex and all of his body hair, including the hairs on his head vanish, even his eyebrows and facial hair.<br />
<br />
Ken lets out a laugh, “you look so ridiculous,” he says, he then grins, “now, a long, thick and strong tail will grow from your lower back, your crotch, hips and butt will merge with it”.<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a whimper when he feels the tingling sensation again, the teen’s eyes then widen and he lets out a gasp, which turns into a groan when he feels something growing from his back, his hips, butt and crotch merging with it, soon Jeff is sporting a long, thick and strong tail.<br />
<br />
“Nice,” Ken says, “now, now for the scales and coloring, which will be as follows: orange scales will cover your face, back, arms, hands, legs, feet and the upper part of the tail, while white scales will spread from beneath your chin, down your neck, covering your chest, tummy, crotch and the underside of the tail”.<br />
<br />
Jeff can only watch in horror as orange and white scales spread over what had once been his skin, “ple-please Ken… no more…,” he whimpers quietly.<br />
<br />
Ken just grins, “why? You are starting to look so good,” he says, “now for the pattern: black stripes will appear on the orange scales, like a tiger”.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels like wanting to cry as the black stripes appear on his body.<br />
<br />
“Wow, it looks just as I have imagined,” Ken says, his voice filled with excitement, “I can’t WAIT for IT to finish!”<br />
<br />
“I. Am. NOT. An. IT,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Oh… but you soon will be,” Ken grins, “now, your face will push out into a lizard muzzle, your ears will shrink back into your head, leaving behind small holes and your eyes will take on the appearance of a reptile’s, while the brown color will become a beautiful electric-blue and the pupils will become slits”.<br />
<br />
Jeff groans as the bones in his face and head pop and crack as they rearrange themselves, giving him the head of a lizard.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, that looks so cool,” Ken says, clapping his hands in excitement, “now, your eyes will become glass, allowing me to see, sharp teeth, which will be made of plastic will replace your boring human teeth, and your tongue will lengthen and fill out the muzzle, becoming silicone”.<br />
<br />
Jeff again groans as the changes wash over him.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “now for the final touch,” he says, “your body will hollow out, all your organs, muscles, veins, nerves, blood and bones will vanish and a seam will appear on your back. Your toe and finger nails will lengthen, becoming long black plastic claws”.<br />
<br />
Jeff whimpers, “K-Ken… I…,” he starts.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah,” Ken says with a smirk, “costumes don’t talk and are unable to move on their own!”<br />
<br />
Jeff then feels himself go rigid as his jaw clamps shut.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “much better,” he says, “the jaw has hinges, allowing it to move with every word I say, and the tail has sensors which align with the nerves of MY tailbone, which will give me the ability to “feel” and control it with my mind”.<br />
<br />
The teen walks around his creation, “it’s perfect… well… almost,” he says, grinning as he flicks the “suit’s” flaccid cock, “but we’ll get to that soon enough. Now, I’m able to communicate with Jeff telepathically”. Ken giggles when he feels his mind tingle, “so Jeff, how are you feeling,” he then asks mentally.<br />
<br />
‘Go fuck yourself, Ken,’ he hears Jeff reply, ‘change me back! NOW!’<br />
<br />
Ken just chuckles, “nah… not gonna happen, Jeff,” he says, “you’ve turned out so amazing, hehe… time to try on my costume,” the teen grins as he starts to strip.<br />
<br />
‘DON’T YOU DARE,’ Jeff shouts.<br />
<br />
Ken just laughs, “you have no say in this, Jeff,” he says, grabbing the “costume”, smiling wide as he strokes over the material, “so soft… hehe…,” he says before turning “it” around and spreading the seam open, grinning at the emptiness, “you must feel so empty, hehe… you must be longing to be worn”.<br />
<br />
‘FUCK YOU!’<br />
<br />
“Haha,” Ken laughs lifting his right leg before slipping it into the leg of the “costume”, grinning wide when he hears Jeff moan, “haha… sounds like you LOVE it!”<br />
<br />
‘F-FUCK OFF!’<br />
<br />
Ken just laughs as he continues to put his former friend on, soon his right leg is completely in the costume’s leg, the teen grins as he wriggles his toes, watching the toes of the costume also wriggle. “So snug,” Ken says, “hehe… now the left leg,” he then repeats the process, “there we go, now… hehe… the costume’s cock will hollow out, becoming a sheath for MY cock!”<br />
<br />
‘FUCK NO,’ Jeff yells before he gasps when he feels his cock and balls hollow out.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, grabbing his erect cock and inserting it into the “sheath”, his grin widening when he hears Jeff moan. Having Jeff distracted, Ken slips his arms into the “sleeves” and attached “gloves” of the “costume”, wriggling his fingers.<br />
<br />
The teen then uses one hand to lift the “costume’s” limp head before turning to the mirror, grinning, “I must say,” Ken says, “the costume sure looks amazing on me… hehe… what do you think… Jeff?”<br />
<br />
‘FUCK YOU! YOU SICK PSYCHO!’<br />
<br />
“Haha… you really are pathetic,” Ken says, “let’s finish putting you on,” he then says before stretching the “costume’s” neck and starts to slip his head inside.<br />
<br />
‘GET… GAH… GET THE FUCK… NGH… OUT OF MY HEAD!’<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles as he adjusts the costume’s head to his own, the seam closing once the neck of the costume snaps in place.<br />
<br />
The teen admires himself in the mirror, his “tail” swishing happily behind him, “this is so awesome,” Ken says, “finally I have the costume I have always wanted… haha… and I didn’t even had to pay a single dime for IT!”<br />
<br />
‘This… this is so fucked up…,’ Jeff mumbles, ‘y-you really are… sick’.<br />
<br />
Ken grins under the head of the costume, “oh… I’m not done yet,” he says.</p>
