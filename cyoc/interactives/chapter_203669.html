<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Stormwolf for the chapter!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Stupid fucking boss not giving me the proper training,” Todd muttered to himself as he drove his car through the town. “‘You’ve been working for me since it started under new management last week.’ What the hell does that even mean?!” <br />
<br />
The young man pulled off the road and parked along the curb. When the car stopped, he put his head in his hands and groaned in annoyance, still a bit pissed off about what had happened half an hour prior.<br />
<br />
The twenty-year-old man had thought that taking a year off from his college studies would be a good excuse for him to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. He didn’t think that it would lead to him sticking dildos up his ass for $20 an hour. <br />
<br />
The young man took his head out of his hands and stared at the hand that he had used to shake his boss’ paw about half an hour ago. Nothing about it looked remotely different. He rubbed his blackening fingernails on his shirt, polishing them. <br />
<br />
“Might as well look to kill some time…” Todd muttered to himself. He looked out his passenger window to see what establishments were on the street he’d parked on, only for his eyes to land on a bar directly in front of where he’d parked his car.<br />
<br />
“Might as well give it a shot,” the young man said to himself, unbuckling his seatbelt and getting out of the car. Although he couldn’t order anything to drink, he could at least see if the food was good.<br />
<br />
Todd walked into the bar, sat down at the counter, and ordered a glass of water to get started while he looked at the menu. While he was still looking at the menu, the bartender, a rather well-built boar with a bit of a gut, brought over a martini and placed it in front of Todd. The young man put the menu down and looked quizzically at the alcoholic beverage that was brought before him.<br />
<br />
“Uh, I didn’t order a martini,” Todd said to the bartender.<br />
<br />
“It’s a gift,” the boar replied.<br />
<br />
“A gift? From who?”<br />
<br />
The boar let out a slight snort as he gestured to someone behind Todd with his head. The young man turned around and scanned the establishment, his eyes eventually falling on a figure who stood leaning against the wall, watching Todd intently. <br />
<br />
The figure was a snow leopard, tall and athletic in build. He wore a tight fitting blank tank top that showed off his muscular biceps and a pair of workout shorts that gave the other patrons a great view of his muscular legs. When the two of them locked eyes, the leopard gave the young man a grin and began to approach him. Todd quickly turned back around, flustered by the attractive snow leopard approaching him.<br />
<br />
“Well hey there sexy,” the snow leopard said in a smooth, buttery voice. “The name’s Mark. I haven’t seen your face around here before.”<br />
<br />
“I’m Todd. I-I’m new to town,” Todd replied as the snow leopard sat down on the barstool next to him. “Just got in earlier this we-” The young man stopped himself. Earlier this week? That wasn’t right. He’d just gotten into town today….right? “I got here today…”<br />
<br />
The snow leopard didn’t seem to mind Todd’s hiccup, giving him a devilish grin that made the young man blush and scratched the gray hairs that were growing on his neck with his claws. Why did he find this feline so attractive?<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m glad I got to you before any other hunks around here did,” Mark said. “It’d be a shame if such a cute guy like yourself ended up with a man who can’t show you a good time.”<br />
<br />
“I…uh…thanks, but I’m not gay…”<br />
<br />
The leopard laughed. “Not gay, huh?” he asked. “Then why’d you come into a gay bar?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Todd asked, giving Mark a look. “That’s ridiculous! This isn’t a…” <br />
<br />
The young man found his voice trailing off as he properly looked around the establishment. The patrons he saw were mostly men, save for a few women. The men were mostly flirting with other men, and the women were flirting with other women.<br />
<br />
“So, you’re not gay, yet you’re in a gay bar,” Mark said. “I’m starting to think that someone’s in a bit of denial.” The feline got up from his barstool and walked behind Todd, gently rubbing his shoulders. “Why don’t you just relax? You like feeling my paws on your body?”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yeah…” Todd whimpered, his facing turning completely red as the buff feline moved his paws down a little towards his increasingly muscular pecs. The young man let out a soft moan as his nipples were squeezed by the snow leopard’s paws.<br />
<br />
“I can smell that you got the treatment,” Mark said, gently rubbing the human’s body, eliciting minor twinges as it firmed under his touch, muscles defining themselves. “What are you becoming?”<br />
<br />
“W-Wolf…” Todd replied softly, ears pointing slightly. This earned a chuckle from the snow leopard.<br />
<br />
“A wolf, huh?” He asked, leaning in close enough to whisper into Todd’s increasingly lupine ear. “It’s a good thing that I think wolves are incredibly sexy.” <br />
<br />
The mostly-human moaned softly, his boxers tenting from the raging hard-on he had sprouted. He wriggled on the stool, a little nub bumping the back of his pants.<br />
<br />
“You know, I can help you with that if you’d like,” Mark said, pointing to Todd’s erection. “Come with me, and I promise by the end of the night you’ll be begging for more like the pup you were always meant to be.” The snow leopard proceeded to extend a paw out to Todd.<br />
<br />
Normally, Todd wouldn’t listen to someone who talked to him like this. He would get the hell out of there and never look back. But for some reason, his mind kept telling him that Mark was…different. The young man found himself panting, drool dripping from a lengthening tongue. He desperately wanted to follow the snow leopard’s orders. Not only that, but this might be the only opportunity he gets to explore some of the kinks that he’s been hiding for so long…<br />
<br />
“Alright…I trust you,” Todd said, taking Mark’s outstretched paw in his own, leathery pads beginning to grow, gray fuzz covering it. The snow leopard grinned and pulled Todd out of his seat and into his arm, holding the younger male close to him. Todd was startled at first, but he found himself practically melting into the muscular snow leopard’s chiseled chest, taking deep whiffs of his masculine musk, little nub in the back of his pants wriggling and popping out another inch, fuzz growing on it.<br />
<br />
Mark smirked as he pet Todd’s head, the hair thickening under his touch, turning gray. He then proceeded to turn his attention to the bartender.<br />
<br />
“Alright Hank, you think you can handle the rest of the night without me?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
The boar laughed and nodded his head. “You act like I haven’t been working for ya since you first opened the doors to the club, boss,” he replied.<br />
<br />
“You’re the man, Hank,” Mark replied. “Expect a generous bonus in your upcoming paycheck.” <br />
<br />
With that, the snow leopard led the young mostly-human towards a staircase that was off-limits to patrons. He was going to show this pup the time of his life.</p>
