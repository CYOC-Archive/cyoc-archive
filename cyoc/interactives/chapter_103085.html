<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My first class of the day went by pretty quickly, even though I had a hard time concentrating on the teachers lecture, for fairly obvious reasons.  After class I hurried to my history class which was next, impatiently waiting for the day to get over so that I could get back to Penny’s and get my equipment back to normal.  This was too embarrassing.<br />
<br />
A couple minutes after I sat down in my seat, my room mate Brandon sat down next to me, grinning broadly.  “Got lucky last night huh?”  <br />
<br />
I smiled faintly and he started laughing.  <br />
<br />
“I knew it when you didn’t get back to the room last night.  Penny again right?”  <br />
<br />
I refused to answer that one.  I may like to look at other girls, but I do have my loyalty. Unlike some people.<br />
<br />
Brandon grinned at me again, making a few more rude comments, which I mostly ignored.  For the most part Brandon and I get along great.  He’s about 6 foot 1 and considers himself a player.  A couple times he’d tried hooking me up with some girls, and I have to admit that they were rather good looking, but I just couldn’t do that to Penny.  One thing I do have to admit about Brandon though is that he’s definitely not boring to be around.<br />
<br />
About halfway through class, Brandon started looking at his watch, then finally whispered to me, “Sorry man, I’ve got to run.  Can I get a look at your notes later on?”  <br />
<br />
When I nodded agreement, trying to pay attention to the teacher at the same time, Brandon gave me a quick thumbs up and hurried off to who knows where.<br />
<br />
Just a little while later, towards the end of my class, a slightly stretching feeling seemed to form around my chest, though I didn’t really notice it at first.  Absently I started to scratch at my chest, stopping suddenly as my chest seemed soft and jiggly under my fingers.  Something was definitely wrong.  Suddenly becoming aware that something was up, I stared at my chest, noticing that it pushed out into two slight bumps, each with my nipples poking through my shirt and looking larger than normal.  <br />
<br />
“What the hell?” I asked aloud, only to get a “shhhh” from someone next to me.<br />
<br />
Looking around quickly to make sure that no one was watching me, I once again glanced at my chest to make sure that I wasn’t imagining things.  What the hell had just happened to me?  As soon as I asked myself this, the answer came to me.  Penny.  She still had the amulet.  Shit.  As soon as class was over, I hurried to the nearest bathroom and made sure that I was alone before pulling  my  shirt off.  There they were, clear and visible.  A pair of girl’s boobs stuck out of my chest.  They only seemed to be a size A, and not very noticeable at all, but they were there.  My nipples were larger than normal too, sticking out more than I was used to.  As long as I kept my shirt on I knew that no one else would notice anything odd.  At least I hoped not.  Damn I was gonna kill Penny for this.<br />
<br />
Since it was my lunch break, I quickly went back to my dorm and got another shirt to wear.  One that was just a little larger and looser.  I didn’t want there to be any chances that someone would notice my latest changes.  After eating a quick sandwich, I started off for my next class.<br />
<br />
What I’d forgotten about until I got to my class was that it was Algebra, and Penny was in that class with me.  Once I saw her I walked over and sat down next to her, glaring for a second before demanding, “What the hell did you do that for?”<br />
<br />
“Who me?” she asked while trying to look as innocent as she could.<br />
<br />
“Yeah you.  Give me the medallion so that I can get rid of these.”  I gestured at my chest in disgust.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Penny said trying to look contrite and failing, “but I left the medallion in my apartment.”  <br />
<br />
I choked at that, beginning to get annoyed with her.  Penny just grinned back and I had a sudden suspicion that maybe she didn’t leave it at her apartment after all.  Not wanting to draw attention by arguing about it in class, I let the subject drop for the moment.<br />
<br />
When algebra was over, I gave Penny a quick kiss on the cheek and said goodbye, hurrying to my last class for the day.  I stopped suddenly though, catching sight of a gorgeous girl.  She was part of one of the sororities, and I remember that she had just showed up a few weeks earlier.  Though I still didn’t know her name, I definitely recognized her face, and her assets.  But then again, every boy on campus did. After staring at her for a moment, I sighed, knowing that I probably wouldn’t cheat on Penny, even for her.  But she would definitely tempt me.  No doubt about that.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt my chest beginning to swell again and grabbed my new breasts in shock.  Though my shirt hid them, I could tell that they were larger than before, perhaps up to a B cup.  Damn.  Looking around quickly, I realized that Penny must have been somewhere around there and saw me looking at that girl.  This may have proved my suspicion about her keeping the medallion right, but at the moment I would have preferred being wrong.<br />
<br />
Sighing, I shook my head and tried once again to remove the ring from my finger.  It was in vain though.  Continuing on to my next class, I really hoped that no one would notice anything odd.  I would have died of embarrassment if anyone had.  Glancing at my ringed finger, I decided that I was going to have to make another visit to Spells R Us and see if that old guy had something that could get it off.  I didn’t know what else to do.<br />
<br />
That class seemed to be the longest class of my life.  Finally though the class ended and I went back to my room, relieved to be alone at last.  As soon as I was safely inside, I tore off my shirts, finally getting a clear look at my (shudder) breasts.  They were definitely bigger and I realized that I was fairly lucky that no one had seen them pushing through my shirt.  I guess my having been wearing a large sweater and walking hunched over helped.<br />
<br />
Looking at them, I couldn’t help but think how odd they both looked and felt on my chest.  It was strange having that extra weight there.  And dead weight at that.  It was like my chest was really fat or something.  Curious, I stared at the large nipples and shook my head, deciding that I’d have to get the medallion back as soon as I could, then find out how to get that damn ring off.</p>
