<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s go with the blood first. Get the doctor&#39;s office vibe going.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, let me just put on my gloves and get my syringe. Ever had blood drawn before?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot;<br />
&quot;Great, so you know how it works. Get your arm out&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Elliot got his arm out and flexed his forearm a bit. He wasn&#39;t scared of needles or anything, but it did hurt a bit so it was his way of not focusing on the pain much.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s with the flex? Not trying to show off now I hope&quot; Jim responded with a smile<br />
&quot;Nah, it&#39;s more of a pain thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;You got low pain tolerance huh? Well, don&#39;t worry about it. It will barely sting&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; He was pretty nervous. Last time he got the blood drawn he almost cried from the pain, and it took a lot out of him to stay still enough to get the blood out. <br />
&quot;MOTHERF- Ouch!&quot; <br />
&quot;DUDE! You can&#39;t move your arm like that. You almost broke the needle! What&#39;s wrong with you? You&#39;re worse than a kid.&quot; When Jim tried to stick the needle in Elliot suddenly pulled back his arm.<br />
&quot;I know! I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just kinda sensitive to pain so it&#39;s tough to keep still. I&#39;ll do it fine next time&quot;<br />
&quot;Well considering your dick pain isn&#39;t the only thing your sens-ooof&quot; Carl tried to butt in but got hit by Sam in the stomach instead.<br />
&quot;Thanks, Sam. Also, Elliot, breaking a needle is pretty serious. Would you be fine with the guys holding you down to make sure you didn&#39;t move much?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah that&#39;d be okay&quot; Elliot temporarily put on his shorts while Sam and Carl came over to hold him down. Sam got the lower half and Carl the upper part. <br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s better if Sam held the upper part. He&#39;s stronger and I kinda need him to keep Elliot&#39;s hand immobile.&quot; Jim was still a bit concerned<br />
&quot;Relax, I might not be as strong as him, but I&#39;m definitely way stronger than Elliot here.&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean you are about average in strength. You need to be at least 2 times stronger than him to keep him like that when he&#39;s in pain. Can you do it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude, you worry too much. I don&#39;t wanna be mean or anything, but Elliot struggles to lift 40kg (abt 88pounds), a girl can pin him down.&quot;<br />
&#39;That is true. Elliot&#39;s been working out about 3 times a week but he is still really skinny. He&#39;s always the first one to get exhausted. Well, it should be okay I guess&#39;<br />
With thoughts aside Jim tried to draw blood again and Elliot started to struggle as expected. Luckily he was held down pretty easily and Jim was able to draw his blood fine this time. Elliot&#39;s struggles made his arm hurt too, which compounded with the needle and his eyes started to water though.<br />
&quot;Elliot, man, are you actually crying? Just from the needle drawing a bit of blood? I guess you cry really easily, huh?&quot; Jim tried to appeal to Jim&#39;s pride to make him shake it off.<br />
&quot;Yeah? I mean, it just hurts, ok? Shut up.&quot; The needle hurt even more than he remembered. Just that was enough to make him cry.<br />
&quot;Um, yeah, okay. So, let&#39;s move on. Get your shorts off again, and bend over. I&#39;ll check your prostate.&quot;<br />
&#39;God, why did I agree to do this in front of the guys? Hell, why did I agree to do this at all?&#39; Elliot took the position as he struggled to remember what possessed him to put himself in such an embarrassing situation.<br />
&quot;Okay, Elliot, just relax. This will end in just a minute.&quot; Jim tried to calm Elliot down as he put some lube onto his finger. He gently rubbed a bit on Elliot&#39;s back entrance before he slowly pushed a finger in. Elliot was surprised at the intruder and jiggled a bit while clenching his butt.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, dude, his dick just twitched. He&#39;s totally getting off on this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Carl, shut up, Elliot isn&#39;t turned on by this, right?&quot; Sam added. <br />
Jim was behind Elliot so he couldn&#39;t really see anything but he also inquired.<br />
&quot;Elliot, are you getting aroused from my finger?&quot;<br />
&quot;I- Well, I. A little bit, I guess. It&#39;s not you or anything, I just have a sensitive butt, I think? I mean I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just...&quot; Why was he getting a boner now of all times? What the hell? He was fairly certain he wasn&#39;t bi, so was it really his butt? <br />
&quot;Okay. I mean, it happens I guess? Are you already fully erect? Do you maybe want me to take it out and then try again after your penis calms down?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. I think that&#39;d be for the best. Just gimme a minute and we&#39;ll try again&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; Jim said, slowly removing his finger. &quot;So, already fully erect before I reached the prostate. What, is your ass rim as sensitive as the head of your dick or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I think so&quot; Elliot once more felt his face go completely red.<br />
&quot;Oh. Well how about it? Think you can keep yourself from cumming while I check your prostate?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, for sure. I mean, I got hard, but I wasn&#39;t gonna cum or anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, cool. Oh, most guys who get turned like that are actually getting turned from their stimulation to their prostate rather than the ass. So, what&#39;s in store for me there? Is your prostate even more sexually sensitive than your asshole?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, probably, but I still don&#39;t think I&#39;ll cum just cause you touched me there&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take you up on that, then. So, are you soft yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, we can try again, if you want&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright bend over a bit. I&#39;ll reapply a bit of the lube before I go in.&quot; Jim once again rubbed a bit of lube on Elliot&#39;s entrance to prevent friction. Only this time, Elliot was positioned a bit differently, with his arms on his knees supporting his upper body, while trying to hide the erection he was once again getting just from feeling the gentle rub. When the intruder barged in he was already at full mast. He tried to take a breath and collect himself but Jim immediately went for his prostate. It seems he wanted to check it quickly so that Elliot wouldn&#39;t be stimulated for long. A kindness that didn&#39;t help since the moment Jim touched his prostate Elliot felt like he was almost on the edge. His prostate was more sensitive than anything he had touched before. He couldn&#39;t help but let out a whimper which alerted the rest of the guys<br />
&quot;Fu-mgh&quot; <br />
&quot;Hmm, Jim, Elliot is definetely leaking pre-cum here. I think he&#39;s about to blow&quot;<br />
&quot;Eliot, are you about to orgasm?&quot; And just like that Elliot hit the edge. At this point, even the movement of removing the finger would probably cause him to climax.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I can take it. Just keep going. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll cuuu-gh FUUUUUUUuck!!!&quot; A last touch to his prostate while he was already on the edge was enough to give him one of the strongest orgasms in his life. He squirted a bunch of cum in front of him while slowly losing strength in his knees and sinking down.<br />
&#39;Oh my god! I just came from my friend&#39;s finger in my ass! And loudly too. I think people outside heard me. There isn&#39;t a hole deep enough for me to crawl into. Just why?&#39; Elliot was about to hide his head between his legs when he noticed all the jizz that decorated them and just put his head in his hands instead.<br />
&quot;Well, that- that was certainly something.&quot; Jim felt pretty awkward but tried to lighten the mood a bit. &quot;Poor Margaret. You always so loud when you cum? My  eardrums are ringing&quot;<br />
&quot;God, yes&quot; Elliot said almost in a whisper. He must be the only guy on earth who is so loud when he cums. Even when he tries not to be. Masturbating with family in the house was pretty much impossible. It was the one thing that his premature ejaculation actually helped with since he could do it even when his parents were out for a pretty short amount of time. He still thanks his lucky stars his parents weren&#39;t close with the neighbors. <br />
&quot;Oh, well. Either way, your prostate seems healthy, as far as I can tell. Honestly I think my androgen theory is more likely. You&#39;re 21 and still can&#39;t grow beard right? You can&#39;t grow hair on your body either, right?&quot; Elliot actually tried to be a lifeguard and he waxed his body in preparation for that, but he ended up being to weak to qualify. Most of the guy lifeguards didn&#39;t actually shave their legs but since hair weighs you down he tried to go for it. He was embarrassed to tell the guys so he just told them he didn&#39;t grow much hair.<br />
&quot;Well, that IS true but still...&quot;<br />
&quot;You miss most of the effects androgen hormones have on the body. It&#39;s much more difficult for you to develop your muscles than other guys, you are short, have no body hair, and have a micro penis. Still, we can check later. Now, it&#39;s time for the testis check.&quot;</p>
