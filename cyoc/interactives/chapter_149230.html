<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Adam and Alex arrived at the cabin about an hour earlier than they had expected. It was a long weekend, and Alex had gotten off work earlier than expected, so the two of them had rushed to leave to beat traffic out of the city. They were pretty serious boyfriends, but also maintained an open relationship when it came to sex. This semi-annual trip the cabin was one reason why.<br />
<br />
Both men were around average height, Adam at 5’9 and Alex at 5’11. Both exercised and watched what they ate, and still had high running metabolisms of men in their late 20’s; but neither man was “cut” by any means. Both dressed fairly conservatively, wearing khaki shorts and solid colored t-shirts. Neither man’s outward appearance would lead anyone to think they were into the kind of kink they had come to this secluded cabin for.<br />
<br />
Max had exited the cabin shortly after he heard the engine die in his driveway. He loved his boys. Almost as much as what he had planned to do to them. “You boys are early!” Max exclaimed in a jovial way. “Brian, Luke, and Brad won’t be here for ‘nuther couple of hours!”  The big man, standing at 6’3” and with the build of a man who had worked in hard labor for the majority of his adult life, wrapped his big arms around Alex and planted a kiss on his lips. Max wore loose fitting blue jeans and an unbuttoned flannel shirt with the sleeves ripped off.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Alex got off early so we rushed to beat the traffic” Adam replied. Max and Alex had broken the kiss, but still stood arms around each other.<br />
<br />
Max chuckled, and gave Alex’s butt a good squeeze, “I hope you boys didn’t do any kind of other getting off fore ya came here” and winked.<br />
<br />
“We would never papa!” Alex exclaimed. Max chuckled again and moved to embrace Adam and give him his welcome kiss.<br />
<br />
“So. Any ideas as to what you boys would like to do before our other guests arrive?” Max asked mischievously. “Coz I have a few”.<br />
<br />
“Well, we could unpack real quick” Adam offered.<br />
<br />
“Unpack? What’s ta unpack? You boys will barely be human this weekend!” Max said, surprised.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Alex offered. “You know we’re going trail riding tomorrow. Adam is going to need to something to wear while he rides me up to the lake, then I’ll need something to wear when I ride him back down”. <br />
<br />
Adam and Max both giggled.<br />
<br />
“Real mature” Alex laughed. “So yeah, not much. But we could claim beds and relax a bit before the other three guys get here.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I doubt there will be much sleepin’ this weekend with what I have planned. Besides that, your bed for tonight is already picked out based on what breed ya are.” Max reasoned, pulling the two men in close.<br />
<br />
“Alright smart guy.” Adam said nuzzling into Max’s chest hair. “What do you suggest?”<br />
“I’ll show ya” Max said with a devious look in his eyes. He paused to concentrate, and both Adam and Alex started shrinking.<br />
<br />

<br />
Brian, Brad, and Luke arrived at the cabin about an hour and a half later. Brian and Brad sat in front, with Luke in the backseat. Brian and Brad have been dating for around six years. Brad was 25, finishing up his master’s in Biology, and Brian was 27 working on his Ph.D. They were emotionally exclusive, but open sexually. That was how they had met Luke about two years ago. The 27 year old muscular blonde had quickly gone from hookup to preferred fuck buddy. Then one weekend the two dark haired boyfriends told Luke about their kinkier interests and their relationship with Max. Luke had been intrigued to say the least. So, with a little help from Max and a one-time use spell, Luke had spent the weekend as a double ended dildo for Brad and Brian. After that weekend, the dark haired couple knew they had to invite Luke into their lives and on these trips to the cabin. Since then, they were mostly monogamous with each other, save for these trips and the occasional evening when Max would come to the city.<br />
<br />
The men exited their sedan and gathered the meager belongings they had brought for the trip. They also didn’t plan on being human much this trip. They approached the two story cabin, but before Brad knocked on the large wooden door, the men heard the distinctive sounds of Max’s moaning and laughing coming from inside. They smiled to each other. Since they saw Adam’s Jeep already parked in the driveway, they had a good idea of what was going on inside. Brad knocked, and the moaning stopped. The door swung inward, and their 6”3 hairy and muscular fuck buddy/mentor greeted them wearing nothing more than a bright pink speedo holding a throbbing erection.<br />
<br />
“My favorite thruple! Bout time you fellas showed up!” Max exclaimed, embracing all three men in a loving bear hug. Max’s boner was pressed up again Brian, and he could swear he felt it wiggling.<br />
<br />
“Hey Papa!” Brad said and leaned up to kiss Max. “It’s great to be here!”<br />
<br />
“Great ta have ya here! It’s been too long!” Max said joyfully, leaning down to kiss Luke.<br />
<br />
“You have no idea Papa,” Luke said, breaking the kiss. “Brian hasn’t shut up for weeks about turning into my dick so I can fuck Brad with him.” <br />
<br />
“Is that so? Max chuckled and pulled Brian in for a kiss. “It seems Adam and Alex have a trail ride planned for tomorrow, so that should give the four of us some alone time. Maybe Papa will join in on that dickin’ action. OR, maybe after yer done fuckin’ each other I’ll melt ya down to cum and y’all can spend some time swimmin’ around in mah balls. How does that sound?”<br />
<br />
“That sounds lovely Papa,” Brad said, placing his hand between Max’s legs. “I can’t remember the last time I got to swim around in your sack. But speaking of Adam and Alex, where are they? I saw Adam’s Jeep so I know they’re here, and I’m a little excited to get out of these clothes and on all fours!” <br />
<br />
Max laughed and stepped back, breaking the four man embrace. “Oh, yeah. They’re around. Tha boys showed up ‘bout an hour and a half ago, so I figured I’d show em a good time till ya got here.” Max concentrated, and the bright pink speedo began convulsing. The color shifted from neon pink to more of a flesh tone. The speedo started expanding, and a pair of legs swung down between Max’s. As the speedo’s legs extended toward the floor, a male’s back was forming, seemingly growing out of nowhere. Once the speedo’s legs had grown enough that its knees were on the floor, the waist band grew into arms wrapped around Max’s hips. Finally a head grew outward from Max’s crotch until the bright pink speedo finished transforming into Alex with Max’s cock in his mouth. Alex withdrew Max’s erection from his mouth, got to his feet and turned to face Brian, Brad and Luke.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys! Long time no see!” Alex said cheerfully, ignoring his nudity. Brian, Brad, and Luke all had erections from watching the transformation.<br />
<br />
“Fuck. That was hot” Brad half whispered, adjusting his erect cock through his shorts. “But where is Adam?”<br />
<br />
Max chuckled again. “Don’t worry, he’s here too.” And Max began concentrating as he bent over slightly. In the same amount of time it took Alex to go from speedo to man, Adam had appeared with his hands on Max’s hips and dick buried in Max’s butt. <br />
<br />
Adam’s eyes were closed in bliss. “Ohh Max. Your hole feels so good. Whether it’s all of me in you, or just my cock.” He said as he withdrew slightly and thrust into Max.<br />
<br />
“Ungh.” Max grunted. “And yer one of the best butt plugs I ever had in me”. Max straightened his posture and stepped forward, sliding Adam’s cock out of his hole. Adam and Alex both moved toward the three new guests, embracing them and welcoming them. The five men exchanged open mouth kisses and small talk as Max watched. He wondered how he gotten so lucky to find five sexy men who were so willing to experiment with transformation magic. Max had studied magic for decades, never dreaming it would lead him to such a wonderful life.<br />
<br />
“Ahem. Boys.” Max interjected. The five men all turned to face their mentor and loving Papa. “It’s bout time to get this show started, dontcha think?” Max asked, cock still hard as a rock. The men nodded enthusiastically. “And y’all know the rules. There’s somethin’ I get to do before the fireworks go off.” Max smirked, banding down to sit cross legged on the floor. The men knew what he meant, but were puzzled by his action. Max concentrated once again, shutting his eyes. After a few seconds of silence, Max disappeared. Where the tall, muscled, kind hearted but kinky man had sat, now there was only a very erect seven and a half inch penis on top of two plump testicles. The five men  laughed. Max had turned himself into his penis. The slit of the penis moved and Max said “I get to fill each an every one of ya with my seed!” He spit a drop of precum out. “Now. Who’s first?”</p>
