<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You smile to yourself, standing there, feeling accomplished with yourself. You were now God... THE God... the ONLY God to truly exist. Your knowledge of everything in existence allowed you insight to know that there wasn&#39;t a devil, there were no such things as angels or demons... none of it. Humanity, as a race, wanting to be submissive and subservient to something or someone... humanity made it all up. It was all a complete, total and utter lie. However... now you had the ability to make everything that had supposedly existed for this entire time a reality and you were eager to get started, but you didn&#39;t know with who or even where. As you thought about the things that were considered evil, taboo or utterly vile, you grinned as you took up your ethereal form, becoming invisible to everyone in existence and focused on the thought of the taboo. Suddenly, your attention was drawn toward two males in particular. One was on his way home to his sixteen-year-old son who was an athletically built somewhat hairy man that had been gay his entire life and had secret intimate feelings for his own son, but never dreamt of doing anything with him... regardless of the hot fantasies he had envisioned in the past. Not to mention... he was a cop and doing something like that with his underage son would mean losing his job, the custodial rights and would have meant that he&#39;d be thrown in jail. The other, was the cop&#39;s sixteen-year-old son, who was smaller than his pops in every way, but had naughty thoughts about being with his own father ever since the day he accidentally caught a glimpse of his old man&#39;s cock. Just seeing the somewhat thick, yet flaccid meat, resting gently on the mostly turgid sack made him incredibly aroused and made him long for the ability to see what it was like hard. He even envisioned himself there, licking at the thick cock head, savoring the taste and enjoying hearing the moans that would inevitably escape from his own father&#39;s lips. Yes... these two whom you had immediately found would do nicely and in their taboo actions, they would become the first of your army... the spawn of God... a dark and evil God who enjoyed such things greatly.<br />
<br />
Knowing that the duo would be crossing paths soon, being that Jake was already at home since school had let out early for him and Duncan was about moments from pulling up into the garage, you decided to make an appearance and fuel both in doing what they had always wanted, yet refrained from doing. First, you figured you&#39;d appear before Jake and then Duncan... once he was home and out of the car. As Jake was sitting there on the sofa, watching the big screen television hung above the mantel of the stone fireplace, everything seemed to feel... off. The image on screen slowed to a stop as did all of the sounds that were clearly heard from outside... including the garage door opening up, signaling the return of his father from work. Jake sat straight up on the sofa, looked around incredibly confused and silently questioned what was going on. As he sat there, Jake even noticed that everything was at a standstill... including the cardinal that just flew by the window, frozen in mid-air, right in the middle of the window. Seeing that he was alert and aware of everything going on around him, you materialized just feet in front of him in plain, black clothing, looking large, muscular and in charge as he popped a boner immediately and went to cover his shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my, my... get that thing because of me?&quot; You asked slyly, knowing the answer already, and stood there remaining clothed for now while Jake sat there embarrassed and blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
Jake just nodded, feeling as though he could be honest with you for some reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I am glad you felt as though you could be honest with me Jake. So... tell me... do you want to see more?&quot; You asked in a bit of a sultry tone.<br />
<br />
Jake blushed for the moment and then nodded. &quot;Y-yes sir, b-but who are you and how did you pop in like that from nowhere?&quot; Jake asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny you should ask, but I am God. Before you ask, yes I am God and I picked both you and your father as the first to show myself to. I know the secret desires you both have and have been praying about, to answer them and give my permission for you to act upon them. I know you want to be sexual with your father and think that I would disapprove, but I don&#39;t. On the contrary, I very much approve. Love, regardless of who it&#39;s between, shouldn&#39;t be frowned upon.&quot; You answered as suddenly your shirt and pants disappeared before Jake, in the blink of an eye, showing him what he asked for and proving that you were a deity of some sort. &quot;Now... this is as much as I will show of myself. I want you to do what you want, to act upon the feelings you&#39;ve had for your father since the day you saw him naked. I remember that day very well and I am sure you do as well. Give in to those feelings and urges Jake... you will not regret it and I will reward you for it as well.&quot; You added as you vanished before him just like you appeared moments ago.<br />
<br />
Then time returned to normal, if for a few moments, just enough to allow Duncan to park the car, turn off the engine and step out to begin closing the garage door behind him. As with Jake, time slowed to a complete stop for Duncan as the garage door was about halfway closed and he was about to enter the house. Also, just like before, you appeared before Duncan in the same black clothing. Startled, Duncan took several steps backward and went to unholster his weapon that was attached to his hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what the fuck?! H-how did you do that? Who the fuck are you and what is going on here?&quot; Duncan shouted, his body trembling in fear, being completely shocked by what was happening all around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duncan... is that any way to treat God?&quot; You asked grinning a slightly evil grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;God... you&#39;re not fucking God! Why would God appear before me, of all people?!&quot; Duncan shouted, feeling slightly more at ease for some reason, but still incredibly apprehensive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well that&#39;s easy. See... I have chosen you to become the first of many to be in my army. To change this world into something much more fitting and I&#39;d need an army to do it because most will be completely against the change and rebuke me.&quot; You said in honest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me... the first of your army?! Army of... what... exactly? Also... if you truly are God... tell me one of my most hidden and darkest desires... since you are supposed to know everything I have thought, am thinking now and would think of in the future.&quot; Duncan said as he continued to become more at ease by the moment, not really even realizing that he was close to putting his drawn weapon away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well... that&#39;s easy. So... let me answer things step by step. As far as an army of what... the answer is what you&#39;ve secretly fantasized about... becoming a werewolf... and not just any werewolf... a demonic werewolf. The second... well that&#39;s just as easy... you&#39;ve thought about becoming a demonic werewolf and making your son one as well by having him enjoy the cream that made him, filling his mouth, hungering over it more and more, swallowing it and turning with each drop. That would about sum it up, yes?&quot; You asked grinning as your eyes took on a crimson hue.<br />
<br />
Duncan&#39;s eyes widened, his cheeks flushed with both arousal and embarrassment as he walked up to you and knelt before you in fealty. &quot;Oh yes... God... my Lord... I have wanted that for so long... prayed about it even and never once had you responded.&quot; Duncan said to you, on his knees, looking up to you in such a wanton way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know my child... I know, but I am here now and I am answering your prayers. You will have what you want. You will become not only a demonic werewolf, but the general of an army that you will make. You will make more fathers into what you will become to do what they want with their own sons... as I know that too is a part of your fantasy... to have several fathers sire their sons into demonic werewolves as well. Does this answer your prayer and please you?&quot; You asked with a dark grin as your appearance became more and more sinister as time went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lord... it does, but can you tell me something? W-why would you want this when you&#39;re supposed to be &#39;good&#39;?&quot; Duncan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest, I am tired of this world... it bores me and I think something like this would liven the place up a bit... for starters. Second, your kind... humanity... has been on a path to destroy this world when it is the only place you can live on since you&#39;ve not explored space and colonized other planets. In order for life to exist here, on Earth, I felt it was time to make some changes and those changes luckily get to begin with you. Not all humanity, fortunately, will become like you and the others in time. In fact, I would like for you to subjugate one million humans... five-hundred thousand male and five-hundred thousand females to continue breeding humans once the majority of the planet has been converted. Your kind... the kind you will become... will have no need for females and thus they will be killed in various ways. No female will be able to become demonic werewolves. If a female is &#39;gifted&#39; with demonic lycanthropy, she will die as her system is not designed for it and they will not become men first, then werewolves and then change into their final forms. Is this also understood?&quot; You said with a powerful and commanding voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lord! It is and will be as you command!&quot; Duncan said enthusiastically, his cock hardening in his pants from the thought of what was to come. Duncan was especially enthralled about the part about women, as he could not stand them. Though he was lucky enough to have had Jake, it was a mistake that he was even born, considering he drunkenly had sex with a woman, got her pregnant with Jake and then when he was born, she handed him over and walked completely out of their lives permanently. He was incredibly happy for this because of his fantasies of incest to be with his own father or his own son and with Jake... it was more of a possibility. Now... it was assured to be what happens, however... he hoped that Jake&#39;s feelings for him would be mutual and not something of a molestation or rape scenario. If it was... Duncan would be fine with that too, but it was preferred to be mutual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good... this pleases me Duncan! I am glad that I chose you and your son to be the first of my new creations upon the Earth. Now... go... enjoy your son in the ways you fantasized about for some time. The more you both act upon your desires, the further you will change both physically and spiritually.&quot; You said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Lord... Master! Just one more thing before I go to enjoy my son... how will I become this new thing?&quot; He asked on his knee looking up at you.<br />
<br />
You simply grinned and turned your thick, muscular hand palm up as a dark, crimson, swirling orb of energy appeared and then floated into his body as the energy immediately dispersed into him, giving him the tool to change. &quot;What I just gave you was dark energy... it will feed off of what you do and change you to reflect it. It is in every part of you now Duncan, so... just kissing your son or having him taste your pre will put that same energy into him, which will also change him. Same goes for any of the other fathers you will seed as soldiers of my new army who will turn their sons or other fathers until the world meets my new plans.&quot; You explained to him as you disappeared before him with time resuming its&#39; normal state of existence.</p>
