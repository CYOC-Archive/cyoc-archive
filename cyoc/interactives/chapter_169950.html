<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Class ended swiftly, and I began to pack my things at an easy pace. I was even humming a little under my breath as I put my things away, before slinging a shoulder strap of my bag over my shoulder. I calmly searched for Doug; I wasn&#39;t done with him just yet.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t hard to find him. Interestingly enough, I only had to concentrate on finding him, and my feet were taking me to wherever he was. He was hiding in the supplies shed behind the school, alone and in the dark. The door was locked, but with the power of my mind, the door clicked and pushed itself open, revealing an alarmed Doug, sat on the ground, knees pulled up to his chest with his head in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are,&quot; I said with an almost kind smile. I took steps closer to him. Doug, the idiot, didn&#39;t seem to realise his place, even after the door had swung open. &quot;You left before I was done with my presents for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He dropped his hands to the ground, hardening his gaze. &quot;What&#39;re you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
I could tell that it took everything in Doug not to move away from me as the muscles in his arms tensed. My smile turned into a twisted smirk, and I shut the door behind me without touching it at all. I revelled in the way Doug&#39;s eyes widened, his face morphing into fear. I leaned back against the walls of the shed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you even know what&#39;s happening right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
His jaw dropped, then his mouth was opening and closing, unsure of what to say. But from the way he&#39;d begun to scan his surroundings, as if searching for an escape, I was sure he&#39;d finally understood.<br />
<br />
I glanced down at his legs and forced them apart. They spread quickly under my mind&#39;s pressure, and I pulled at his ankles so that his legs were spread eagle. Then without giving him a second to recuperate from his shock, I glanced at his crotch and imagined grasping his penis with a firm grip. He gasped loudly, and I could feel him try to close his legs - but I was ready, and I kept the pressure I held against his legs going whilst stroking his tiny cock.<br />
<br />
He whined, reaching to touch his penis as if to stop the spectral hand from groping him, but his efforts were fruitless and only seemed to add to the pleasure. As I continued to stroke his length, I raised my eyes to his chiselled chest, and pinched the hardening nubs with my mind, twirling and pulling and flicking them with my newfound powers. He cried out, but even as pleasured as he was, he shook his head and refused my ministrations.<br />
<br />
Not that I would&#39;ve changed my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You f-fucking, aaah, fag - ngh! - stop this!&quot; he screamed.<br />
<br />
I was pleasantly surprised to know he wasn&#39;t begging to be released yet - after all, it would&#39;ve been boring otherwise. Or maybe if he were begging to be released and I continued... Would that have been more entertaining? I mused this as I continued with my power, playing with his body. I dipped an imaginary fingertip into the slit of his cock teasingly, one of the forces on his legs now caressing his inner thigh pleasurably.<br />
<br />
He moaned, but then he slapped a hand over his mouth and I frowned. I decided to pull his hand away so I could hear his voice - to hear him cry out in pleasure despite his denial.<br />
<br />
His chest was heaving, his breathing becoming laboured. His 3&#39;&#39; cock was straining against his pants. I pulled his pants down with the hands on his legs, and he yelled as his tiny member sprung into the air. He attempted to cover himself up, but with my hold on his wrists, he could do nothing but wriggle. I laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And one more gift for you,&quot; I sing-songed.<br />
<br />
I traced a line down his dick with the hand on his cock, running it down his short length down his balls and over his perineum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nononono,&quot; he whimpered, repeating himself as if it would deter me.<br />
<br />
It instead fuelled me further, and I began to press the finger against his pink pucker mockingly. He was sweating, tears beginning to form; I didn&#39;t care. His asshole gave way beneath the pressure, engulfing the tip of the finger. Then steadily, I pushed in, even as he began to thrash wildly. Despite that, I could tell he must feel good, as his cock twitched curiously upon the appendage&#39;s entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, Doug,&quot; I chided. &quot;We don&#39;t want the entire school coming over to see what&#39;s happening now, do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
At my words, he stopped, and tears were streaking down his face. It was a good look on him, I noted, my own length twitching appreciatively. I&#39;d taken to ignoring my own arousal for now whilst I&#39;d punished him, but it was getting difficult to ignore.<br />
<br />
I mindlessly stroked myself through my jeans as I continued to push the finger in and out of Doug&#39;s asshole, before adding another and eliciting another gasp from him. When I curled my fingers in his pucker, however, he cried out, long and drawn out, as I repeatedly stroked his G-spot. One look at his face, and I could tell he was torn between loving and hating the feeling, but I also knew he seemed ready to give in. I allowed one of the hands on his legs to vanish, the other running up to touch his member again.<br />
<br />
He was groaning and moaning wantonly as I massaged the spot again and again. I added a third finger into him, and changed my pace. I began to piston them into him, hard and fast, watching as he was penetrated by an unseen force spreading his hole. As he began to reach his orgasm, I made the hand around his penis grip harder, denying him of his climax cruelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You slut,&quot; I scolded without any heat. &quot;You&#39;re getting off of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t seem to hear me, instead crying over his lack of release. With my mind, I turned him over so that his ass would be in the air, and he rested on his cheek and chest. Then I began to pound into him again with my fingers, watching his hole gape open with an invisible force. The hand on his cock was back to work, stroking him quickly. Before he orgasmed again, I pulled him up by his wrists with my mind  and aimed his trajectory at his chest.<br />
<br />
White shot from his small penis, barely reaching his chest despite the intensity. <br />
<br />
As he came down from his high, I wondered what I should do next.</p>
