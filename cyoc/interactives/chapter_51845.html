<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>I can't believe I'm a mannequin!</i> Jenny thought.  She wasn't able to move at all.  She held her ridiculous pose, her legs still spread apart, arched forward, blowing a kiss to no one, her ass sticking out for the entire world to see.  And it wasn't as though people ignored her.  It was the opposite.  People kept glancing at her, staring at her chest, or her ass, or just giving her the once over.  <BR><BR>

One woman had approached her and felt the underwear - the invasion of privacy was almost too much for Jenny to bear.    <BR><BR>

She preferred it when she was alone, because then at least she could try to rationalize the whole situation.  She kept trying to convince herself that this was just a dream.  That her body, which had been turned against her and was now a stiff prison, was going to change back eventually, and that she would forget all about this.  But when people looked at her as they walked by, or fingered her clothes, or poked her, or did any number of other things, she didn't feel real.  They didn't look at her like they would look at a person.  They looked at her like they would look at an object.  At something that wasn't real.  <BR><BR>

The worst was when someone she knew walked by.  A friend from another school, who she frequently met up with for lunch.  She tried calling out to her.  <i>APRIL!  APRIL!  HELP ME!  I'M A MANNEQUIN!</i>  <BR><BR>

But it was useless.  April just walked by, oblivious.    <BR><BR>

Jenny was a mannequin.  An object.  <BR><BR>

The first few hours were the worst.  And the most boring.  Just standing there, watching the people walk by.  Shopping.  Talking.  She could hear everything, feel everything.  At one point, the air conditioner came on, and just the feeling of air brushing against her plastic skin caused her to have a mental orgasm.  She was beginning to lose track.  <BR><BR>

At one point a group of two girls came up and inspected the panties, dragging them up and down, and then left, with the panties hanging around her legs.  Jenny mentally blushed.  <BR><BR>

<i>Don't expose my private area like that!</i> she screamed at them mentally.  But of course, they couldn't hear her.  No one could hear her.    <BR><BR>

However, the cute salesgirl who had moved her to the lingerie section in the first place came wandering by a few minutes later.  She shook her head as she looked at Jenny.  "People are such jerks," she said.  She looked up at Jenny's face.  <BR><BR>

"You're kinda cute," the salesgirl said.  Jenny wasn't sure how to react to that.  She didn't want to be thought of as cute - not by another girl, and certainly not when she was a mannequin!  That was just weird!  <BR><BR>

The salesgirl leaned forward to adjust the panties...and then, without warning, before she lifted them up, she licked Jenny's crotch!  It was smooth plastic, sure, but the sensation of the salesgirl's tongue on her former pussy caused Jenny to cry out mentally.  She wanted to feel that again...but then the salesgirl shook her head, pulled up the panties, and hurried away.    <BR><BR>

<i>That felt sooooooo good!</i>  Jenny thought to herself.  <i>Oh God, if I could only move....I would have......</i>  But she stopped that line of thought right there.  She wasn't a lesbian.  She liked guys.  <BR><BR>

But the sensation of that <i>tongue</i>........  <BR><BR>

Someone walked by, smirking up at her.  She knew that face from somewhere...but where?  <BR><BR>

Oh!  It was Kyle!  What the hell was that skeevy little geek doing here in the women's underwear department?  He really was a creep.    <BR><BR>

"Well, well," he whispered.  "Ah Jenny.  You've given me such a good idea."  <BR><BR>

Jen was floored.  <i>He knows who I am!!</i> she thought.  <i>Oh my God!  How is that possible?!  Kyle?  Can you hear me?  Please!  Help me!  I'm trapped as the mannequin!  You have to find some way to get me out of this!  Oh God, please!  I can't move at all!</i>  <BR><BR>

But if Kyle heard her, he didn't react.  He just smirked and walked away, after the salesgirl.  <BR><BR>

The rest of the day passed without much trouble.  No one bothered her.  She just stood there, a stationary object.  A mannequin.    <BR><BR>

And then the store closed.  <BR><BR>

And that's when something REALLY weird happened.  <BR><BR>

The salesgirl came back.    <BR><BR>

"I had to see you before I left..." the salesgirl whispered.  Jenny was confused.  Did she knew that Jenny was a real human girl, and not just some plastic display?    <BR><BR>

"I had to see you...just one last time...I know it's so stupid of me to talk to a dummy, but there's something different about you..." the salesgirl whispered.  Apparently not.  "Oh, this is so fucked up."  <BR><BR>

Then she tore down Jenny's panties and started to lick her crotch, moaning.  <BR><BR>

Jenny went a little blind with pleasure.  She screamed mentally, orgasming several times, without showing any sign.  Her plastic skin tingled with pleasure, and she wished for nothing more than to be able to reach out and interact with the girl, but she was stuck, frozen, only able to receive pleasure, unable to release any or return the favor in kind.  <BR><BR>

Then the salesgirl took off the panties, adjusting Jenny on the display.    <BR><BR>

"I'll take these," the salesgirl said mischeviously.  "So I can keep something of you to remember you."  And then, standing before Jenny, she removed her pants and panties, and slipped on the ones she had been wearing.  "Mmm..." she said.  "Much better."  <BR><BR>

She started to pull her pants back up, when suddenly the salesgirl shuddered.  "Ooh!" she said.  "That felt weird!"  Then she moaned again.  Jenny watched in stunned silence, unable to ask what was wrong.    <BR><BR>

<i>What the hell is wrong with this girl?</i> she wondered.  <BR><BR>

"Oh my GOD!" the girl screamed.  "That feels so GOOD!"  <BR><BR>

Then the girl stiffened in surprise.  "What the?" she said.  "What's wrong with my legs?"  She tried to take a step forward, but ended up falling forward, almost knocking Jenny over, and she landed on the floor.  Jenny wobbled back and forth, watching with a growing sense of horror.  <BR><BR>

From the waist down, the salesgirl had become a mannequin.  <BR><BR>

The salesgirl rolled over, and looked down at her plastic legs.  "WHAT THE HELL?!" she screamed.    <BR><BR>

Someone laughed.  <BR><BR>

Kyle stepped into view.  "What do you know?" he asked.  "It worked!"  <BR><BR>

"Who the fuck are you?!" the salesgirl demanded.    <BR><BR>

"You won't remember me - we played a little game earlier," Kyle said, grinning.  "You won't remember me once i leave either.  You see, this mannequin was once a human.  Now she's a mannequin.  I managed to put a curse on you, while changing the curse on Jennifer here!"  <BR><BR>

<i>YOU did this to me?!  You fucking prick!  If I ever get out of this, I'll KILL you!</I> Jenny screamed mentally.    <BR><BR>

"Don't worry, Jenny, you'll forget all about my involvement once I'm gone.  But just wait till you hear this next part!  You see, if anyone wears any clothes that you've been wearing, they'll also turn into a mannequin!  Of course, I didn't forsee this situation...but it should make tomorrow VERY interesting."  <BR><BR>

"You sick fuck!" the salesgirl shouted.  "What are you talking about?  Change me back!"  <BR><BR>

"Sorry, I'm afraid I can't do that!" Kyle said.  "But I will help you along anyway!"  <BR><BR>

"What are you--?  HEY!" the salesgirl shouted as Kyle picked her up and propped her up against a nearby rack of clothes.  WIth her stiff lower body, she couldn't run away.  Kyle began to strip her clothes, ripping off her jacket, and then her shirt, and finally, her bra.  And then Jenny understood.  <BR><BR>

<i>Don't do it Kyle!  Let her go!  Let me go!  Why are you doing this to us?!</i> she wailed.  But it was no use.  Kyle didn't response.  <BR><BR>

He took the bra off of Jenny.  <BR><BR>

"NO!" the salesgirl shouted.  "I don't want to be a mannequin!  PLEASE!"  She tried to fight Kyle, but she wasn't able to get any leverage.  Kyle forced the bra onto her.  The salesgirl was crying, and she tried to move her arms to get the bra off.  <BR><BR>

But it was too late.  Halfway there, she stiffened up and gasped in surprise and pleasure.  And then her skin began to harden, and become reflective in the light.  Her arms moved against her will, and went to her sides.  Even as the tears fell from her still human eyes, her face drew itself up into an unwilling smile, and she could only moan softly in protest, her eyes darting from side to side, as she stood there, another motionless mannequin.  Her hair attached itself to her plastic head, and became plastic, fake like a wig.  The salesgirl was now a mannequin.  <BR><BR>

"Very nice," Kyle said.  "I'll leave you two here to be acquainted," he said.  And then, with another smirk at Jenny, he turned and walked away.  "Have fun tomorrow girls..."  <BR><BR>

<i>DAMN YOU KYLE!</i> Jenny shouted after him.  But she wasn't able to do anything, and the former salesgirl stood there, just as motionless as she was.    <BR><BR></p>
