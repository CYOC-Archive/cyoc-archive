<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane led Dustin through what appeared to be the sewers. Looking around he could see the occasional human peering out from behind boxes and crates. The conditions they were forced to live in was deplorable. Most of the ones Dustin saw were filthy and they reeked, or maybe that was the sewer itself. Dustin had to know something so he said &quot;Jane, you seemed to be real happy to see me alive. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because for five years we had thought you were dead&quot; a female voice said from the shadows and Dustin jumped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to scare Dustin Richelle?&quot; Jane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have always greeted Dustin that way Jane and you know it&quot; Richelle said stepping out of the shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only one that dared to scare me was Rick&quot; Dustin said with a disbelieving look on his face.<br />
<br />
Richelle smiled and hugged Dustin saying &quot;It's good to see you alive again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you were made into a girl too?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup&quot; Richelle said stepping back and smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you end up like this?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I was captured and sold to a male drake&quot; Richelle said. &quot;He had come late to the auction and I was the only one left on the auction block. He bought me and had me genetically modified like Jane. For fours years I was his sex slave until two months ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a drake?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically part human part dragon&quot; Richelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you think I was dead?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we didn't think you were dead, we knew you were dead&quot; Richelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Dustin asked loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down Dustin&quot; Jane said. &quot;We'll explain when we see Elder June.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explain now!&quot; Dustin demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Richelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richelle, you know Elder June wants to tell him herself&quot; Jane said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Richelle said. &quot;We're here anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
They had been walking while they talked and they had come to some sort of chamber. In the middle was a group of people talking to one that had a larger than normal head that looked like a brain. The person turned around and Dustin was shocked to see that it was his mother. &quot;We have brought Dustin as you asked Elder June&quot; Jane said.<br />
<br />
June smiled and said &quot;Thank you Jane&quot; before embracing her son. &quot;Oh Dustin, I'm so glad to see you alive again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I just skipped five years into the future&quot; Dustin said. &quot;I haven't been dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears streamed down June's face and said &quot;Richelle, tell Dustin. I... can't... do... it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish&quot; Richelle said. &quot;You never made it out of your house. Elder June and your father came home to see the house completely destroyed. After the fire died they were able to go through the ruins and they found your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the house wasn't destroyed&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because we sent Jane back to get you before that happened&quot; Richelle said. &quot;Doing that has changed the time line. Now instead of knowing you died you were presumed dead, your body reduced to nothing but ash by a direct hit from Ty's fireball.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We took you before you died&quot; Richelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I will die?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That remains to be seen&quot; Richelle said. &quot;You will not die in the past as we are not sending you back there. Now before we bring out your power you need to know a few things about Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know he's a dragon god now and he's enslaved people&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But do you know his history?&quot; Richelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's my foster brother&quot; Dustin said. &quot;I know he had gone through several foster homes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me educate you&quot; Richelle said in a low tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I'm convinced you were Rick&quot; Dustin said. &quot;So educate me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty was born a dragon&quot; Rihelle said and smiled as Dustin got a confused look on his face. &quot;He is the son of the dragon god Tiamat and a dragoness named Eshantr&eacute;. During his early childhood he showed signs of having inherited great power from Tiamat. He used this power for his own personal gain so several races banded together and cast a spell on him. He would be bound in the body of a human and sent to Earth. The wizards and witches who cast the spell were supposed to come along with him. However their spell was disrupted by Eshantr&eacute; and they ended up in different times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go get them?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't&quot; Richelle said. &quot;If we did you and I would not exist now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are descended from the drake witches&quot; Richelle said. &quot;You are a direct descendant of the witch drake leader. Once we bring out your powers the other descendants should feel it and gather nearby. Hopefully the other races will also sense it and gather. You will be our leader in the fight against Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I learned much during my captivity&quot; Richelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Dustin said. &quot;How do we bring out my power?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will transform into my drake form and the use my power as a beacon&quot; Richelle said. &quot;If it's successful you'll transform into a drake. Though you will need to decide which sex you want to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you wish to use your full potential you will need to become female&quot; Richelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the female body of any species can hold more magical energies than the male&quot; Richelle said. &quot;This is due to the fact that the female of most species is the one that carries and gives birth to the young. You should be about as effective against Ty if you remain male. Though you need to decide before we begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin thought about this for a bit. Two of his friends were girls now so it would not be too awkward to be come a girl himself. If what Richelle said about females having the ability to contain more magical energy that would give him and edge against Ty. One the other hand he liked being male and he had his eye on a certain girl before all this happened. Would she still catch his eye if he became female? It was a tough choice. To become female or remain male, that is the question.</p>
