<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen walked away, her new body moving in ways she didn&#39;t like, her legs strutting like she was a runway model, she tried to stop herself, she fidgeted just a little and let out a scream of frustration, knowing she was doomed to do everything her mother&#39;s way from now on, and gave up on trying to change things.<br />
<br />
She had lied this morning about her mother, it wasn&#39;t that she was a negligent mother, it was that she was overattentive, she pushed Jen into everything, she hovered over her daughter, trying to mold her into her the perfect version of the girl she never was. Jen found herself walking in her mother&#39;s trademark sexy bank teller uniform, she had specifically picked clothes that were a size too small, just to show off her bust and ass. Jen was glad the school day was over, she could at least have the weekend to get used to being in her own mother&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
She found her body moved in exaggerated ways, the most annoying part was her chest swaying back and forth slightly, rocking her enhanced breasts back and forth, she wanted to stop, but knew she couldn&#39;t, but what disturbed her most was the fact that she would be physically acting like her mother for the rest of her days.<br />
<br />
“That little fuck.” She shivered as she heard her mother&#39;s voice, “Now I&#39;m stuck as this fucking sexy bitch. I can&#39;t believe he did that to me, piece of shit.” She grumbled as she walked on, she absent mindedly started to fiddle with the buttons on her blouse, undoing one at a time until the shirt was undone. She then rummaged around in her messenger bag as she continued to talk to herself. “She always wanted me to be more like her, and now I&#39;m in her body. Are you happy mom? I&#39;m just like you!” She shouted as she popped something into her mouth and then recoiled, she wanted to spit the candy out but wasn&#39;t able to get her mouth to cooperate.<br />
<br />
“Sour Apple! I fucking hate sour apple! Why can&#39;t I spit this out?” She then looked down. “And why is my shirt undone?” She lifted her hands to try and button up her shirt but found they just adjusted the shirt to show more of her cleavage. “GREAT! NOW I&#39;M A PIECE OF EYE CANDY?” She stood there in her mother&#39;s body huffing, until she finally gathered her nerves. “Get it together Jenny Wenny.” She froze, what did she just call herself? “No, I&#39;m not you. You can&#39;t just call me Jenny Wenny. You can&#39;t be in here.” <br />
<br />
Jen stood there waiting for an answer when it dawned on her. Kyle&#39;s curse would have effects on her in varying ways, now that she had to wear what she wore, speak like she spoke, walk like she walked and do what she would do, most of her free agency had been forfeit to her old mother&#39;s habits, she could still speak to herself, but on occasion, she may just talk to herself like her mother. She shivered, looking down at the body she now inhabited, rocking from side to side for a moment. She continued walking in the direction of her house, her body incessantly strutting and gently shaking her breasts back and forth. <br />
<br />
Jen got home after a half hour, she didn&#39;t live that far away, and entered the house. Slipping off the heels she finally could walk normally, she remembered something her mother had said to her when she commented on how she walked. “With a body like this? Why not put on a show?” She shivered at the thought and went to her room, dropping her messenger bag and getting undressed, she soon found herself down to her underwear. She went over to the mirror, it wasn&#39;t like she hadn&#39;t seen her mother next to naked before, she always wore revealing clothing even in private. She stared at her reflection for a moment and undid her bra. “Be free my girls!” She froze, she hadn&#39;t meant to say that, “Great. I&#39;m acting more and more like her!” She finished stripping and nervously grabbed a pair of panties then went to the shower.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom her soaps and shampoo had changed, all to scents that her mother liked, not that she minded this, her mother always did smell nice, that she could appreciate. She got in the shower and turned on the water, it was a little too warm for her liking, but instead of changing the temperature she just grabbed the loofa and started cleaning, even though she tried to fight, she just couldn&#39;t take complete control. Her movements in the shower were different, she usually started with her arms, but now she was starting with her face. Jen realized she would do absolutely everything like her mother now and sighed, giving up on trying to fight it, it was useless.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s right Jenny,” She said out loud. “Just do what momma does.” She shivered, understanding that she would talk to herself like this from now on. Her cleaning ritual was longer, more sensual than what she was used to, finding herself messaging every part of her body, the fact she couldn&#39;t stop it made her uncomfortable, she was practically feeling herself up. By the time she was done almost an hour had passed, she grumbled, it wasn&#39;t how she wanted to spend her time. Her after shower ritual had changed as well, with her long blonde hair she would have to blow dry her hair, which took even longer. <br />
<br />
Jen suddenly realized she was worrying about time for nothing. She stopped at the realization, “That&#39;s right, I&#39;m not on cheer squad anymore! I don&#39;t have to worry about all of that!” She chuckled, continuing what she was doing, and finally finishing up she walked down the hall to her room. She opened her closet and stopped, all of her clothes were replaced from what they had changed to this morning with what her mother had worn, her blouse and skirt combos for work, her tight fitting shirts and pants, a couple of pairs of heels, each at least four inches tall, and one pair of slip on running shoes.  She rushed over to her dresser, her comfortable sweats all replaced with what looked to be skin tight versions, her shorts cut so short they may as well be a bikini. <br />
<br />
Everything had been made for her mother&#39;s tastes, she shuddered, knowing she would feel exposed for the rest of her life. She grabbed a pair of the sweats and slipped them on, they were comfortable, but left nothing to the imagination, hugging every curve. She went to grab a bra but found herself going to the closet for a shirt, realizing that her mother never wore bras around the house, or going out anywhere unless there was a dress code. “Damn it.” She said as she slipped on her too tight v neck shirt, it&#39;s fabric hugging the contours of her body, giving her ample bust a little lift, the v neck showing some of her cleavage. “She always was a show off, I hope no one says anything about it, nothing I can do anyway.” <br />
<br />
Jen walked over and grabbed her messenger bag walking out to the living room, she sat down on the couch, at least she could do her work, her mother always made her do her homework on Friday. <br />
<br />
“Why put off your work for the weekend?” Jen said out loud, “Do it now so we can have some fun.” She smiled a little, her old mother Jessica was right, she&#39;d get this taken care of so she wouldn&#39;t have to worry about it, then she could deal with being more like Jessica than she ever wanted to be. It would be an hour before her &#39;mother&#39; would be here, and she wondered how she would react to what she was wearing.<br />
<br />
As Jen worked she found herself annoyed, her right hand kept fidgeting with the pen, clicking it repeatedly, and she couldn&#39;t stop. Soon she found herself humming songs she didn&#39;t know while working, but found something to like about her new vessel. She was laser focused now, somehow, Jessica had hidden the fact that she was very, very sharp, her mind was much clearer than in her old body, and she seemed to be doing work faster. “Way to go Jenny!” She said to herself, “We&#39;ve got this.” She found this less shocking and more reassuring, she finished just as her mother pulled into the drive way. <br />
<br />
The new mom came in and set down her purse walking into the living room, the moment of truth, would she comment on her clothes or...<br />
<br />
“That was a long day,” The new Jessica said, “Oh hi Jen! How the work going?”<br />
<br />
“Just finished.” She smiled back to her.<br />
<br />
“Good, we&#39;ve got pizza coming, your father will be late as usual, that man works way too much.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I know, he practically lives at that office.” <br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m off to get a shower, and hey! Cute outfit, I wish I could pull that off!” Jen tried to hide her look of shock, no one was going to react to the fact that she was dress like a sex pot? What was school going to be like?</p>
