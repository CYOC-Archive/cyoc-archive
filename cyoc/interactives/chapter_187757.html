<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were rather impressed by the host of measurements that Kellie and Roxie had taken from you and Luna and mentioned them out as they took them, including everything that went into how those measurements worked, and there were some things that surprised you. In human form, Luna&#39;s bust was a 33E with her waist at 23 and her hips at 34. In her MILF-wolf from she was now 41G-33-43. In human form you&#39;d been 32E-23-34 while in MILF-wolf form you&#39;d grown to 41GG-33-44. It was something you&#39;d never thought of as much and much of your attention had been rather amused pleasure at finally being female while finding Luna to be even more beautiful as a MILF-wolf. Now, you knew all those measurements in their full detail and Kellie and Roxie remained more than happy to help. <br />
<br />
Of course a part of you remained curious as to whether or not this was to honestly help you or to keep Luna happy, given that you and Luna had been good friends for years. Now, after finding that Luna was a born MILF-wolf that Luna had felt about you in much the same way you&#39;d privately felt about her, things had exploded into something you&#39;d never thought possible. You and Luna had had sex to turn you into the MILF-wolf you&#39;d become, getting Luna pregnant in the process, and you had the real sense that the two of you would be together for a long time. Though Roxie and Kellie&#39;s teasing calls to you and Luna as &quot;love birds&quot; was another reminder that they were largely okay with your relationship with Luna and that they weren&#39;t too off put by seeing either of you naked. Though, strangely, you also didn&#39;t mind being naked in front of them either, and neither did Luna, though that was possibly because you were there with her. After all, your lack of shame was more because Luna was there and you got the sense that she was pleased with how you looked.<br />
<br />
Luna looked to you and licked at your muzzle before turning to her mother again, &quot;well... I think we&#39;ve gotten the most important measurements. Bust, hips, height, tail. The only thing left would be our feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither you nor Nicki can wear shoes while transformed,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;you know that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Luna nodded, &quot;but I&#39;m a bit curious... as I was only like a five and half shoe size before my first transformation... then after it... in human form I&#39;m a size twelve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a men&#39;s size eight,&quot; you admitted, &quot;becoming Nicki  actually grew my feet to a woman&#39;s size eleven. Not as much growth as what Luna had... but still a lot. And they are bigger still in this form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kellie nodded, &quot;that&#39;s largely to help with hunting and all that. If it weren&#39;t for the Wolf Hunters... Roxie and I might even consider taking you and Luna hunting for some actual practice at chasing deer and things like that... but... the longer feet in MILF-wolf form helps with that. They allow for a longer stride, faster acceleration, and even faster reaction as most of your foot is up in the air and you&#39;re only on your toes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The human stance has better balance with the heal on the ground,&quot; Roxie added, &quot;but it will limit speed, reaction, and acceleration.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This may sound like a dumb question... but then why did my feet and Luna&#39;s feet get bigger in our human forms?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie gave a bit of a shrug, &quot;I really don&#39;t know. Some of that is present with regular werewolves to... and the whole &quot;worshiping our feet&quot; thing with MILF-wolves has been more the result of run ins with people with foot fetishes who end up cutting their tongue or lips on a claw by accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always guessed it was a means to store something that would allow for their growth when taking MILF-wolf form,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;but the scientists and doctors that were there when I became the first one Kellie changed really didn&#39;t have any concrete answer one way or the other. So we don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only shrugged, &quot;I would agree with Luna that I&#39;m a bit curious to how different in size our feet our now.&quot;<br />
<br />
This had more to do with your foot fetish, and potentially Luna&#39;s, if she actually had one. You had no reason to doubt her, but it was something rare and a part of you figured that as yours and Luna&#39;s relationship became more romantic in nature that there was something that was there that made you want to do things that would make Luna happy. You figured that that went the other way too, and thus Luna was saying things because of that sense... though it wasn&#39;t something you could confirm, and it could be that Luna had had a similar fetish and had never admitted before last night. Still, your curiosity was there.<br />
<br />
Though, you also knew that measuring yours and Luna&#39;s feet now could only relate to the length of the foot and that there was no shoe that was made big enough to support the long digitigrade feet of any werewolf, MILF-wolf included. Based on the Brannock Device&#39;s measuring system the largest men&#39;s size was 14 and a woman&#39;s at 15, which still came at a measured length of twelve inches while the conversion to &quot;last length&quot; had that measured foot length of twelve and two third inches. You&#39;d studied a bit on this to learn a bit on how feet were measured, and that served your personal interest in it. Though it also presented you with the knowledge that yours and Luna&#39;s feet were too big for any shoe size to be calculated. Sure, a number in theory could be guessed at, but that would involve a lot of math that you weren&#39;t as good at. The fact that your presently padded feet didn&#39;t shoes also made it unlikely that a werewolf of any kind would wear shoes, thus &quot;shoe size&quot; was an irrelevant measurement. Though the length of the foot did intrigue you, and from Luna&#39;s nods, it seemed to interest her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Kellie commented as she got down onto one knee with the measuring tape and ran it from the base of your heal and then down to the floor where ball of your foot and it&#39;s pad touched it. &quot;Okay, Nicki, your arch is 21 and 1/3 inches.&quot; She then paused to measure the distance from the ball of your foot to the forward most claw on your toes. &quot;The rest of your foot is 4 and 1/2 inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s over two feet long!&quot; Luna said in surprise.<br />
<br />
Kellie then lifted up your foot to measure across widest part of your feet where that pad was. When she finished she looks up to you, &quot;and at their widest point, your feet are now 5 and 2/3 inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you managed, &quot;that&#39;s... that&#39;s well bigger in every way than where I was as a man... though they would still seem rather narrow when compared to how long my feet have grown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s again something that relates to how a canine&#39;s foot functions,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;your feet are wider to support larger body mass and have some balance as a biped, but many of these adaptations are also there to assist in a quadrupedal stance to aid in hunting and let you move quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; you said slowly, &quot;though... now it&#39;s Luna&#39;s turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stepped to a side as Luna licked your muzzle again before standing where you&#39;d been to let her mother measure her transformed feet. Kellie went over it in much the same way she&#39;d measured yours and then announced them as she completed the measurements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Luna,&quot; Kellie began, &quot;your arch is 23 inches long even and the rest of the foot is 5 and 2/3 inches long, for a total length of 28 and 2/3 inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too long for any shoe market,&quot; you whispered to Luna, &quot;though... I wouldn&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to cover them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna shushed you with a wave of her her arm, though you figured that Roxie and Kellie both heard you. Though they didn&#39;t say anything about what you said and just went about with taking the last measurements.<br />
<br />
&quot;And like Nicki,&quot; Kellie then announced, &quot;Luna... your feet in this form are 5 and 2/3 inches wide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, we grew nice big feet,&quot; Luna smiled to you, &quot;in both forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though this form especially,&quot; you smiled back to her as you felt Luna&#39;s tail bop your butt, making you wag your tail to bop her butt back.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I trust that&#39;s all you wanted measured?&quot; Kellie asked as she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;there could be some things on the length of our muzzles and length of our fangs... and the size of our ears, but that could probably wait for a night when you and dad don&#39;t have a &quot;girl&#39;s night&quot; planned and aren&#39;t taking up time out of dad&#39;s day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; Kellie answered as she moved over to hug Luna and with Roxie soon joining her, &quot;but always know that we love you and would do anything to help you. For you may have matured into a wonderful MILF-wolf and won your own mate and started your own family. You&#39;re still our daughter and we love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Luna said happily, &quot;and thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled at the seen, though one glance over to the clock that was on one of the nightstands by Roxie and Kellie&#39;s bed, you could see that it was now two PM. It would be a while before the sun set and before Kellie and Roxie had their girl&#39;s night out with friends. That then raised the question on what to do next.</p>
