<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your body continues to alter and expand and your green scaly hide feels tighter now and you moan as you feel two appendages burst out of your back, and slowly grow into two large bat-like wings, or the wings of a dragon. You look up at the dragoness in agony and fall over onto your knees breathing heavily. &quot;You’re thinking of him now, aren’t you? I knew he’d make the perfect man for you.&quot; The dragoness said with a cheerful smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....&quot; You said then moaned and dug your claws into the ground as your ass expanded a bit, and your hips grew out to wide child bearing proportions. However, the reason you paused was because your voice had become higher pitched, like a bright, young woman fresh out of college. &quot;Don’t speak with words just yet my dear, you&#39;ll bite your tongue. But your voice sounds delightful. Oh how I can imagine you singing to him dreamily under the light of the full moon and stars while you dance with him.&quot; The dragoness said and you blushed as those same thoughts coursed through your mind, and while you still felt like yourself, you could still imagine how wonderful it would be to feel engaged to her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit up for me hun, and spread your legs a bit so we can see how you’re doing.&quot; The dragoness said and you nodded and made your way to your knees then you spread your legs and looked down to see your slimming form and your body. You looked down and watched as your chest began to feel heavier and two soft mounds pushed out around your nipples and inflated forming a large pair of E cup breasts. You blushed at this, then flushed a deeper red as you saw your penis and balls, which were small now, slowly shrivel up into a slit innthe center of your crotch, and your couldn’t see, but you felt your masculine dick form the entrance of your vagina, and then your balls reformed into your new ovaries within your body. <br />
<br />
As your body finished transforming you looked up at the dragoness shocked, and she smiled at you and said,&quot;Perfect! Oh, he will be so happy to see a bright, strong woman like yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and blushed slowly standing up in front of the dragoness, looking to the ground and blushing twisting your leg and claw on the ground, clawing up the rubber awkwardly and said,&quot;Ummmm....&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragoness paused for a moment then she perked up and exclaimed,&quot;Oh, apologies, but I should’ve really introduced myself to you first. I am sure that you know who I am as a role by now, so my name is Raila. That stud in the reflection there is my lovely halfbreed son, Drasik, and you’re future mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...umm.....I uh...understand th...that part....b...but I was.....w...wondering why exactly you d..did this t...to me.&quot; You stated blushing still looking up at the Raila blushing with your wings folded and your claws held behind your back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my son if half human you see, aaand I want to have grandkids of my own. Unfortunately for my son, weredragons aren’t common at all, and most only last for one night at a time, and he is quite depressed as of late. He wants a mate just as badly as I want him to mate, so if we couldn’t find a permanent weredragon like him, I decided to take it upon myself to make one for him, and I found the perfect cutie for him. You’re adorable, and you’re perfect for him, don’t you think so?&quot; Raila asked<br />
<br />
You blushed covering your breasts with one claw, and with the other you pulled back your longer brown hair and peered at his reflection again and nodded slowly. &quot;He&#39;s.....attractive, or he is now....to me....&quot; you said blushing and  the dragoness nudged you with her snout and said,&quot;Don’t cover up your breasts now hun, they’re all the better to get his attention with. Plus this is a permanent form for you now, from now for thousands of millenia until you die content with your life. So dreamboat, have a name?&quot; Raila asked you smiling cheerfully <br />
<br />
You paused nervously then hesitantly spoke your name and Raila and she nodded then said,&quot;Ah yes, a perfect name, Castalia. That’s what your feeble male name is in our tongue, but turned female. Ah yes, Drasik and Castalia, husband and wife, and son mated to daughter in law. Oh now please, you must come with and meet him, he&#39;ll be so happy to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused blushing nervously and stammered,&quot;N...Now?...b..but what do I...I say? Wh...what will...&quot; Raila shooshed you and covered your mouth with one of her large claws then held it out and said,&quot;Don’t worry, it always come natural with love, and I know that you&#39;ll both feel the same about each other. Now let’s go before he sees you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then nodded and walked onto Raila’s claw and allowed her to carry you over to the other side of the ship wreckage. Raila set you down and turned then nudged her son, who was skipping random pebbles across the pool of water, and said,&quot;Oh Drasik, how are you doing my sweet boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooom, I&#39;m not a boy anymore, don’t you remember that I’m looking for a mate?&quot; Drasik groaned<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Drasik, that’s why I’m here honey!&quot; Raila exclaimed and Drasik paused and looked up at her then he looked beyond her and saw you. You blushed as his gaze turned to you and you looked down at the ground nervously and scratched at the scales on your arm. Drasik immediately perked up and stood up then walked over to you slowly, and he paused looking to you then his mother and asked,&quot;What...what is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I saw that you&#39;ve been depressed lately, so I decided to embrace the reasonhy mortal humans come to this island. I saw her a male human riding alone and miserable without love, then I took him and turned him into the young cutie that you see before you. She’s still not used to this and shy, but she has feelings for you, and I figured that you two would be perfect with each other.&quot; Raila said and you nodded shyly and just stood there watching Drasik.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....well.....I....&quot; Drasik began but he seemed just as speechless as you were, but from him being shocked rather than shy. &quot;I can assure you that she wants to do this, and unlike most halfbreeds she&#39;s like you and as you can see it’s midday and she’s still as draconic as you or I.&quot; Raila said and her son just stared to her and back to you with his jaw dropped for a few moments then Raila smiled and said,&quot;I&#39;ll give you two some alone time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raila then left and you just stood there staring at Drasik, and he walked up to you seeing you come up to his neck in height. Drasik examined your body shocked then he paused his claw on your shoulder and rubbing up and down your arm. &quot;Unreal....you actually real...and you...wanted this like mother said?&quot; Drasik asked and you paused awkwardly blushing and twirling your tail in your claw idly and said,&quot;I...I mean....not at f...first, she caught me off guard. B..but after I saw you....you looked attractive, and I....I wanted to do this like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drasik nodded slowly then said,&quot;I...I s...see, well...uh....when did you become....this?&quot; Drasik gesture to your entire body and you blushed in response then said,&quot;Minutes ago....it feels so....weird, but...well...it’s natural. It’s foreign, but it feels like I am supposed go be like this. It’s just....I’m not used to this yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s understandable, and an understatement by what you speak of. Who are you? Did my mother translate your name yet?&quot; Drasik asked, and you nodded to him and said,&quot;Castalia I believe, and she told me yours is Drasik, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Drasik Vaxel the third...but....wow, this is almost too good to be true.&quot; Drasik said then he sighed and looked at you then his eyes darted down to your breasts and privates naturally. You couldn’t help but blush hard red and hide them, but then Drasik noticed this and he looked up at you and realized what he did and stammered,&quot;Oh shit...s...sorry, it’s....j...just....w...wow....y...you’re astounding.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused looking at him blushing then asked,&quot;Huh? Wh...what do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your rack, it’s beautiful....er...sorry again, I keep forgetting you were human and a guy. Y..you see normally dragons can’t cover breasts, but we’re weredragons, and half human...sooo...well I don’t know what you should think here.&quot; Drasik said and you paused and just looked at him and blushed looking down at your body more. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...well...&quot; You stammered then Drasik looked at you and put his claw on your shoulder and said,&quot;Sorry, you aren’t used to this yet, so I shouldn’t have said anything.&quot; You paused as you watched his claw go from your shoulder to your claw and he took that claw and put his other on your hip and he said,&quot;Hey Castalia, would you...really like to be my mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked into Drasik&#39;s eyes and nodded to him and said,&quot;Ever since I saw you....I think you’re...cute actually.&quot; Drasik blushed a bit then he chuckled as you turned away, and your hair now covered your face. Drasik lifted your chin to face him then he moved your hair aside with his claw and said,&quot;I think you’re cute too you know? Would you like it if we got to know each other more? I know mother would certainly like it knowing her fantasies.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to him uncovering your breasts and placing your claw on the claw he had on your hip and gave him a small warm smile. &quot;Heh, trust me, all those feelings within me, within you, that’s just our lusts for each other. The reason we’re awkward is because we’re trying to be civilized with something that’s usually instinct. But, unlike our instincts I want to help you adapt to this, get used to your body, live life, and yes have eggs with you eventually if the time comes. I don’t want to stress you out over it though, so just tell me what you’re comfortable with me doing.&quot; Drasik stated and you nodded then you took the claw he had on your hip and placed it on one of your breasts blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels...weird for me, but you can if you want. I won’t know how it feels otherwise, right?&quot; You exclaimed then giggled then Drasik nodded and slowly rubbed your breast with his paw and you couldn’t help but let out a long soft moan as he caressed it. &quot;I can only imagine how this feels for you, so I&#39;ll be gentle at first. Until you’re completely sure about this I wouldn’t dream of much more, and even then concent is always something I wish.&quot; Drasik said and you nodded then looked up at him and said,&quot;Mmmm, this feels so nice actually, and I&#39;d like that, actually I&#39;d love that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drasik smiled down at you then eased off of your breast and just stared into your eyes for a few minutes, and after a while he asked,&quot;Castalia, how about we go somewhere tonight? Let some of the others here know who we are, and just well....go out on a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused before you answered then slowly nodded to him and asked,&quot;Where will we go?&quot; Drasik smiled at you warmly then said,&quot;How about.....&quot;</p>
