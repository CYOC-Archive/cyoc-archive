<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Craig slowly rubbed at his giant tool, relishing in the way his titanic chest, wide lats and brutally built arms all fought for space. Had he not been so spectacularly endowed by the ointment, he might not even be able to rub at his tool due to his insane build. He shook the last of his cum out of his cannon and sighed happily, giving himself a nice, big flex in the cum-coated mirror, his magnificent reflection warped by the sheer amount of seed that he had put out.<br />
<br />
With a waddle that would put even the biggest of bodybuilders to shame, the now titanic football player made his way to the side of his bed, still in a haze from his impressive orgasm. He laid down, reveling in just how massive and heavy he felt on his bed. His hands roamed up and down his musclebound form. His eyes fluttered as his hands touched his massive, hairy pecs, his skin crawling and his dick jumping as his index fingers and thumbs twisted his thick nipples. The big beast of a football player moaned lewdly as a juicy dollop of pre-seed drooled out of his megalith 2&#39; of cock, landing squarely in the middle of the canyon that had become the space between his giant chest muscles.<br />
<br />
The drool became a thin stream as his arms went further down, his fingers getting caught in the luscious swirls of body hair that now dusted his powerful, thickly muscled abs. Despite being so shredded, his body fat so low that he&#39;d seen veins crawling along the surface of his abs, they were bowled out slightly. Craig didn&#39;t seem to mind, no, he loved how powerful he felt. How strong, how male it felt to just be huge!<br />
<br />
Craig let out an appreciative grunt as his hands felt the striations running along his thighs, the insane delineation between his quads and his sartorius. Craig couldn&#39;t get over how hairy he had become all over! He gently played with the hairs on his thighs, loving how just much muscle his hands could roam over, gliding over mountains of muscle, his hand grazing over the hairs. It was then that he accidentally brushed against his hairy balls.<br />
<br />
Craig shuddered and moaned happily. He arced his back, feeling the meat of his lats and traps digging into the bed. His arms reached forward and cupped his giant, oversized balls. His forearms, hairy as the rest of him, brushed against the length of his enormous fuck-stick.<br />
<br />
It was then, he realized, he wanted -MORE-.<br />
<br />
The &#39;enhanced male experience&#39; wasn&#39;t enough for Craig. No, he wanted the -ULTIMATE- male experience. He looked over at the ointment that was still in the tub on his nightstand. The big beast licked his lips, the drool of a maniac getting caught in his thick beard hair. All that power, it was right there.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, the 300+ pound muscle monster unscrewed the cap and dug his fingers into the cooling gel, dragging a huge glob of the creamy ointment into his hand. He was about to lather it on his cock again when he realized... a normal dose had made his cock wildly larger with respect to his enhanced body. Craig knew he&#39;d grow everywhere, but wondered if he could make his body more &#39;proportional&#39; with respect to his megalithic cock, as silly as a concept of proportions could be for a 300 pound musclefreak like him.<br />
<br />
Instead of slathering the ointment onto his cock again, Craig slowly massaged it into his huge chest. The big man moaned lowly, grinning loosely as the warmth and tingly, almost menthol-like feeling seeped into his pumped chest-meat. He bounced his massive pecs, the cool air mixing with the ointment. Giving off a low hum, Craig dipped his hand back into the jar and took another dollop onto his abs. The big beast&#39;s cock gushed a stream of pre-jism onto his abs as well, mixing with the cream as he applied it. In his delirious state, Craig took more ointment and slathered into his palms before caressing his mammothian arms, his eyes rolling back as he felt the deep cuts of his triceps, biceps and forearms. But Craig didn&#39;t stop, the huge mountain of meat sat up and took another dollop of the cream and massaged it into the parts of his thighs he could get his hands on.<br />
<br />
With a grunt of dissatisfaction, Craig snorted as he tried to get the ointment on the back of his legs and ass... realizing he&#39;d grown far too muscular to reach all the way back. Realizing he&#39;d need help reaching his ass and back, he frantically looked around his room, finding a t-shirt that would now be far too small to ever fit his gargantuan frame. With wanton abandon, Craig scooped the last of the cream up and onto the shirt. He stood up, his cock dangling precariously outwards, and his massive balls rubbing against his inner thighs. He used the shirt like a towel, gliding it back and forth over his expansive back and ass.<br />
<br />
The huge mass monster thundered back over to his mirror, the cum starting to crust along the cold surface of the mirror. He flexed for himself, enjoying the cool feeling of the ointment as his skin brushed against itself where his colossal biceps met his forearms and shoulders, where his giant redwood like legs touched almost all the way down to the knees even when his feet were shoulder width apart. The tingling sensation began to build, the feeling evolving from the coolness of mint to a light burning sensation. It was working. Craig, in a haze of excitement, waddled his way back to his bed and flopped onto his back.<br />
<br />
He felt the warmth begin to build, much like it had last night. An overwhelming calm took over him, so eerie it almost felt like dread. His hands roamed around his body, the meat of his muscles pushing his fingers apart as he worshiped his growing frame. He knew he should be looking, taking in the feeling of his growing body, but the warmth overtook any other sensation. It just felt so good.<br />
<br />
Craig could barely recognize the feeling of hairs sprouting out of every new inch of skin, his masculinity magnified to ever greater proportions as his body exploded with growth. The feeling of the ointment was almost enough to mask the sensation of his facial bones beginning to reconfigure, his brow becoming more prominent, as did his jaw, masculinizing even further. His brows were thicker and out of his jaw, a thick beard now grew. Craig&#39;s breath steamed the mid-morning air as he continued to feel up his body.<br />
<br />
He moaned lowly as his hands inevitably made their way to his cock. It was a struggle, he could feel his body resisting the motion, his muscles now far larger than they had been. Every passing second, he could feel that resistance grow, his body evolving, changing to become even more god-like in proportion.<br />
<br />
Craig wondered if perhaps... he had become too male. A thought he had very little time to contemplate. His cock, despite receiving none of the ointment, felt larger and thicker than it did before, much like his body had grown even though he had only applied the cream to his cock last night. Through the mental fog of the wondrous warmth of the ointment, Craig vaguely could feel liquid pooling along his bulwark of a neck, whether that was sweat or pre-cum, he couldn&#39;t tell any more.<br />
<br />
His bed collapsed, the now overgrown giant&#39;s mattress falling to the ground. The shock was felt the most in Craig&#39;s balls and the hulking, hirsute titan of a man&#39;s eyes went wide as it was enough to send him over the edge. His deep, basso profundo voice shook his room&#39;s walls, rattling his football trophies as he came. A geyser shot up to the ceiling and the first wave cam crashing back down, landing on Craig&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
The force was enough to knock the beast of a man out.</p>
