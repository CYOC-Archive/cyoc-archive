<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The warning is more for a herm self pleasure... even though Whitney is only pleasuring her male equipment at the moment...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Outside the door Whitney lay in sort of guard position that Megan and Jenny had instructed her to. Her mind hovered in a bit of a haze that she couldn&#39;t fully understand. A part of her knew that she should be human and not Worm Slug Woman, but that part of her was also lost in some of that haze, and at the same time she got a mental reminder from Megan and Jenny that even if she did... she could not go back to being human. She was a Worm Slug Woman now and that was all she would ever be and the rest of the Chapman family had been exposed to the transformation spell in Megan and Jenny&#39;s slime when they first arrived and had that reinforced open sexuality that Slug People were known for. Whitney couldn&#39;t fight that, especially with whatever had her mind so hazy at the moment.<br />
<br />
That left her with only one thing that she could focus on and that was keeping her family together. And that had been no easy task over the years, her son and his sisters all had different interests and often following them, which now as they reached college was beginning to take up more and more time... particularly during the school year. She&#39;d been lucky that everyone had come home for the summer, but it wouldn&#39;t be long before it ended and she was left alone with an empty house. Lucy had argued in the past about finding a new husband, but Whitney had long rejected that. Her marriage to John Chapman had been a happy one, but ended when he&#39;d gotten caught in a fire a realtors&#39; office downtown. She&#39;d never known why he was there, but he was and what was reported as faulty wiring lead to the building catching fire and taking him with it. Whitney had mourned heavily and she really didn&#39;t think any man could live up to her dead husband&#39;s memory.<br />
<br />
That was ultimately something gave her mind some confidence with regard her now being a Slug Woman and her family would become Slug People as well. For if Megan and Jenny were right, and they&#39;d all be Slug People, the odd magic that seemed to keep Slug People genetically different from each other would let her stay with her family and be assured that her new family was worthy, and that did overtake the haze on her mind a bit... The hope that her family would stay together and would be strong, and Whitney wanted that above all else. Megan and Jenny were attractive in their own right, and Whitney found herself unable to resist admitting that, but Jeff, Lucy, Zoe, and Grace filled a bigger place in her heart than the other two Slug Women as they went elsewhere in the Chapman House. Something in the back of Whitney&#39;s mind told her that her guests were going to shut the water off to the master bedroom, but for the moment, Whitney didn&#39;t care about that. All she wanted was her children to transform, join the hive, and then they&#39;d be a family again.<br />
<br />
That was the real reason she supported Megan and Jenny at the moment and why she let whatever was holding her mind in a haze stay there. It wasn&#39;t necessarily that she couldn&#39;t fight it, but for the moment she had no full reason to want to fight it. All she wanted was to reunite her family so that they could be together. Thus she sat calmly outside the door in the hopes that Jeff or Lucy or someone would relent and at least let her into what was normally her room, anyway. From there she could continue to accelerate her children&#39;s transformation into Slug People and they would be a family again and then their family would grow together and Whitney&#39;s mind didn&#39;t get much further than that. But so far the door had remained locked and since she knew she couldn&#39;t break the door down, she did the only thing she could do to try and facilitate that end.<br />
<br />
And that had been continually pump the penis she&#39;d grown when her physical transformation into a Slug Woman manifested. Her body was long and thin with her tail beginning where her hips began and it was packed with enough muscle for her to hold her torso up and erect and still trail out behind her so that when &quot;standing&quot; she was a good six feet long and with every pore of her tail and body covered in a thin layer of slime. At the point where her legs had met her hips before her transformation there was a slit that covered and concealed her major reproductive organs and those that would be used for any needed bathroom visit, but for the moment she didn&#39;t need to go and she wanted her family and the only way her hazy mind could think that possible was to help them transform. Thus, accepting that she was a Slug Person and that Slug People were naturally horny nearly all the time she let her penis, and former clit, extend out from that opening.<br />
<br />
The fact that she had become a being based on an invertebrate mollusk and still kept many human features, as well as gaining male human features didn&#39;t really bother Whitney at the moment. The magic that created Slug People supposedly combined human and slug DNA somehow, a voice in the back of her mind seemed to tell her, but she paid little attention to it, and focused on her mission at the moment. And parts of that combination served to feel rather good, as the slime that covered her also seemed to cover her penis as she held it in her hands, and as she brought her hands up and down the shaft, her slime also served to keep it cool and avoiding any issues with &quot;friction.&quot; It was like it was a natural lubricant and that maximized the pleasure Whitney felt as she brought herself to orgasm a few times and pumping loads of semen against the doorway and picking up the aroused and sexual scent with the smaller stalks at the corners of her mouth. That was enough to know that she would be able to keep her children aroused and then they would either transform or let her in to be transformed and they&#39;d be a family again. Whitney&#39;s biggest hope was that Jeff would turn first and become a rare male Slug Person, since most Slug People were hermaphrodites and identified as female.<br />
<br />
But as time passed, she got very little sign that anything of that nature was actually happening. She could hear and feel a wide variety of &quot;voices&quot; echoing through the hive mind that Slug People had, and there seemed to be a large community of them to the north of the town where the Chapman family lived, but those voices were distant and the feelings there were as hazy as Whitney&#39;s mind presently was. She thought there were signs of concern and worry there, but Megan and Jenny urged her to ignore that and they weren&#39;t a concern right now. Whitney let her love for her children put that issue behind her and she kept up with her attempts to try and get her children horny enough to transform, as Megan and Jenny promised they would.<br />
<br />
It was only when she began to physically tire and began to move closer to the door, more to make sure that if anyone came out, they would have to move over her, that she began to feel something move into the hive mind that Slug People had. At first it was very faint and almost fearful, which puzzled Whitney a bit, but as it continued to develop it began to get stronger and then Whitney could sense another presence through the hive mind, and it was close by. It wasn&#39;t a new arrival, which meant the only other Slug People there were Megan and Jenny, who were now asleep downstairs from what Whitney could sense. This had to mean that one of her children had transformed and Whitney wasn&#39;t the only Slug Person in the family and that lifted some of the haze on her mind for the moment as some sense of hope arrived there.<br />
<br />
Whitney tried to probe forward with her mind, see which one of her children transformed and what he/she felt about their new status and raising the hope that before the sun rose they&#39;d all be a happy and horny hive of Slug People together. It was what Megan and Jenny wanted, and they seemed nice, and Whitney wanted it too, to keep the family together. But the hive mind wasn&#39;t perfect telepathy, and the hazy shape of Whitney&#39;s mind made its focus even worse. In this, she could get some senses of emotion and &quot;love,&quot; but she couldn&#39;t get much more. The only thing that she could sense was who transformed. It was Grace... her youngest daughter had transformed first and it made Whitney want to scoop Grace up in her arms and hug her daughter to assure her that things would be fine now.<br />
<br />
&quot;GRACE!&quot; Whitney tried to call mentally, hoping that Grace would pick up on her excitement and let her in. &quot;GRACE!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was little real response as Whitney pressed her head against the door, almost as if the cum coated door was blocking her thoughts and getting closer would give Grace an easier opportunity to hear them, or at least feel them... assuming her mind was just as hazy as Whitney&#39;s was now. She ended up getting a few sensations back, as Grace was still conscious, but some things puzzled Whitney. Some of it was focused on her siblings, which seemed understandable, but there was also some hesitancy there, like Grace wasn&#39;t interested in accelerating her sibling&#39;s transformations. This really puzzled Whitney as she&#39;d loved her transformation when it hit... to simply have an orgasm because of the changes in her body felt amazing. It was something that she thought anyone would enjoy. And while Megan and Jenny had said that all of them would experience it... a part of Whitney&#39;s mind said that they should WANT to transform, and that was where her mind was in its own internal conflict.<br />
<br />
Eventually Whitney did get a sort of loving response from Grace, but it seemed to only be directed at her. It was like Grace wanted her to come to her senses and turn on Megan and Jenny and to let the others be. There was no joy at being a Slug Woman. There was no love for Megan and Jenny, and in fact from what Whitney could sense... it was as if Grace was still opposed to them. It seemed to remind her of the hazy voices from far away that said that &quot;humans should WANT to be transformed before being transformed not just transformed and made to accept it.&quot; Whitney couldn&#39;t understand that as the part of her mind that was hazy essentially fought with the part of her mind that loved her family and children. That part of her tried to fight back and tried to get to Grace, but her youngest daughter was also getting sleepy... and that finally served to get Whitney to drift off to sleep. The excitement at Grace transforming wearing down into physical exhaustion from the day and how late it was, her transformation, and then spending additional energy masturbating to try and accelerate her children&#39;s transformations... which had only seemed to work with Grace. With that... Whitney finally drifted off to sleep.</p>
