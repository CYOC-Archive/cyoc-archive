<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diego chose to wish to be the most flexible person alive and Joella made the wish out loud.<br />
&quot;How long will the wish take to go in to effect?&quot; asked Diego.<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Joella responded. &quot;I didn&#39;t specify a time.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s already happened!&quot; said Diego. Diego contorted his arms and legs and put his legs behind his head for the first time in his life. &quot;This is amazing!&quot;<br />
Jordan spoke up: &quot;I wish I would&#39;ve thought of that. I bet you can self-suck now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said Diego, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to freak anyone out.&quot;<br />
Joella had always been very interested in witnessing self-sucking, so she came up with an idea. She would wish that the three of them were transported to one of the boys&#39; houses to explore Joella&#39;s new wishing powers more. She told the boys about the idea and they all agreed to transport to Diego&#39;s house because his family had a pool and a hot tub where they could hang out in the sun.<br />
Joella made the wish and in a moment, the three of them were in Diego&#39;s room. Diego sat on his bed, and put his head down to his groin. His neck extended in a way that looked impossible, but sure enough he managed to get his mouth to the front of his pants.<br />
&quot;Go further!&quot; Said Joella.<br />
Diego extended his neck between his legs and twisted his head around until his mouth was at the butt of his pants.<br />
&quot;That was amazing,&quot; said Jordan. &quot;Is it time for Joella to make a wish?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, Joella. What are you going to do?&quot; asked Diego.<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m going to wish for something sexy.&quot; Joella wished in her head to have a five minute transformation to replace her genitals with a smooth, hairless triangle of skin in her groin. She started feeling the changes after a few moments, but the boys couldn&#39;t see anything happening. She started to feel euphoric and felt some internal organs re-arranging themselves. She asked the boys is she could take off her pants to watch the transformation. The boys were eager to see what the transformation was, so they watched as she removed her pants.<br />
Watching the transformation through the front of Joella&#39;s panties, Jordan asked if he could pull the panties down to get a better view. Joella said that she&#39;d like that very much and so Jordan slowly pulled the panties down and was in awe to see Joella&#39;s anatomy changing. The entry to Joella&#39;s vaginal canal was in the final stages of closing and the pubic mound was becoming less prominent.<br />
Joella could feel herself let out a little bit of cum as the transformation neared completion. She didn&#39;t care that the boys saw. She knew that they could all trust each other.<br />
The three were speechless and all seemed to be getting a little turned on by seeing Joella&#39;s transformation. After a minute, Diego spoke and asked how Joella was going to pee with no hole for pee to come out of. Joella wasn&#39;t too concerned and responded that they&#39;d cross that bridge when they got to it.<br />
Joella told Jordan that it was his turn to make a wish now. The three felt emboldened and wanted to try more extreme transformations to test the limits of what was possible. Jordan wanted to change his friend Diego&#39;s body some more and the group decided that they could each come up with one wish for the other two in the group.<br />
Jordan decided first on a wish for Diego. &quot;It might be too weird,&quot; Jordan said sheepishly. Diego let him know that he was fine with whatever, so Jordan whispered his wish for Diego in Joella&#39;s ear. Joella giggled upon hearing it and Diego waited for Joella to think the wish in her head.<br />
Jordan made a wish request for Joella while they were awaiting Diego&#39;s transformation: that Joella grow a small fox tail. Joella wished for it to grow fast, and felt blissed as she could feel the tail push out from above her butt crack. It only took about a minute, and since her panties were already pulled down, the tail freely grew until it hung down about 10 inches.<br />
Diego was starting to feel changes in his chest and he took his shirt off to investigate what was happening. His areolas had expanded almost to the size of a typical woman&#39;s and his nipples had grown out and become very swollen. Diego expected to have breasts pop out and was feeling a little shy about Joella and Jordan seeing. However, the transformation didn&#39;t seem to include breasts, just nipples.<br />
&quot;I kinda like it,&quot; said Diego as he involuntarily started to feel his nipples with his fingers.<br />
Joella and Jordan told Diego together that the change was not only aesthetic, but that Jordan had also had Joella wish that Diego could lactate.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so sexy. I can&#39;t believe this is happening,&quot; said Diego. Diego had told Jordan a couple weeks earlier that if he could have any part of female anatomy for one day, it would be the nipples because he thought it&#39;d be cool to lactate.<br />
It was now Diego&#39;s turn to think of a wish for Joella and a wish for Jordan. What does Diego wish for?</p>
