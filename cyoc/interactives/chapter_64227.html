<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, the day had gone a lot better than he ever could’ve hoped it would.  Not only had he managed to resolve the dicey issues raised by that disastrous first debate, at least, to a certain degree.  But on top of that, he had managed to obtain the missing information on George Wayne.  True, he was still quite the aggressive bully as far as he was concerned, but at least now he understood why this was the case.  What mattered now, however, was repairing the damage that he knew he was, at least, partially responsible for.  <br />
<br />
These were Patten’s musings as he made the long walk back to his own home.  He pulled out the picture of the African Rock Python he had shown Wayne a while back.  He did feel guilty about not using an actual photo of Clemens, but he didn’t think that the ones he had sent to himself would be suitable.  Whether it be Clemens Cos-Playing as Thulsa Doom, in a rather raunchier style, or showcasing himself in a sexually suggestive manner.  He’d have to apologise to George  for that move later, when he had a better photo to use, complete with explanation.  Unless Clemens made good on his word to visit in 4 days for a week-long visit, in which case, he’d just swap the photo for the genuine article.  <br />
<br />
Though Clemens did, thankfully, see fit to reveal a good deal of information about his new life.  Meaning he did know a good deal about what he was going through, and how he was dealing with it.  One thing though, he suspected George may have misinterpreted, was the number of limbs he had.  Five in total, allowing him to stand at just under 7 feet, 8 if he stood straight up.  The curving caused by his need to balance out his tail which would put him at close to 16 feet in length.  True, he could still drive a car, but he had always preferred a motorcycle, plus it would be easier for him, owing to said tail.  <br />
<br />
He’d been in this train of thought for so long, that before he realised it, he was back in his home.  Letting himself in, he checked the Mac he kept in his study, revealing a few e-mails for him since he’d left a couple of hours back.  The one that interested him was from Clemens.  It read simply:  <br />
<br />
‘Be there in 3-4 days.  Attached picture you insisted on.  See you then.’  <br />
<br />
He downloaded the picture sent to him, revealing, finally, a much more modest, A4 sized picture of his cousin.  He wore, what appeared to be custom black Lycra shorts and a lengthy duster jacket of the same colour, that managed to get to his knees.  The mouth lacked any fangs, but did seem to have a few spaced teeth, maybe 6 to a side for 24 tops.  Most likely resulting from having two genetic codes mixed together.  <br />
<br />
“Finally, I got a picture of you that I can actually show people.”  Patten spoke to himself, and was quick to print a few off.  One, he would frame, another, he’d hand to George, or more likely Molly since they were both on the Summer Sun programme.  With this issue tackled, he now focused on the real task at hand.  Stopping Hireman.  Requiring from him, a phone call to the local paper.  After three rings after dialling their office, he received a response.  <br />
<br />
“Hello, Columbia Fall Daily.”  A female voice answered.  <br />
<br />
“Yes, this is Joseph Patten speaking.  If I give you something to report, can you get it into tomorrow’s edition?”  <br />
<br />
“You’re cutting it close, but yes, it’s still possible.”  <br />
<br />
“Good, because what I have to say is very important, concerning yesterday’s debate.”  <br />
<br />
“Go on…”  This had clearly piqued her interest.  <br />
<br />
“Very well, but can you record this call?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, give me a minute, do you want to have it recorded?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, it’s vital that you do.”  <br />
<br />
“Alright then……there, it’s set up, you can start.”  <br />
<br />
“Good.  When Hireman made his attack on Mrs Choir and Mrs Rhoer-Wayne, he made two colossal errors.  First, he used what was my attack on Officer Wayne as an individual, and turned it into an attack on them both in general, taking it completely out of context.  The second is that between the time I made that attack and now, I learned a few things that told me the information that I had initially based my judgement on was incomplete.  Not inaccurate, incomplete.  Therefore, the first conclusion was not completely correct, since I didn’t have all the facts available.  This means that Hireman twisted my incomplete facts for his own ends, all made possible by the fact that he had made that recording in secret, withholding the fact that he did such things from everyone.  A major betrayal of trust on his part.”  <br />
<br />
“This is serious information you have.  Are you certain you have it right?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, with what I know, I know this to be the case.”  <br />
<br />
“I see, well, I can’t make any promises, but I’ll try to get the statement into tomorrow’s edition.”  <br />
<br />
“Very well  then, thank you, one last thing, can you also include the fact that I will be supporting Mrs Choir in her candidacy for the School Superintendent?  As she is one I know for certain is putting the welfare of the children first, above any personal vice.”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, we can, but only if we start now, so we need to end this call now, if there‘s to be any chance of making the next day.  Good day Mr Patten.”  <br />
<br />
“Good day to you, too.”  And with that, the call was ended.  <br />
<br />
Now that that was done, the fight back against Hireman could begin in earnest.  On top of that, he needed to be ready, not only for Clemens arrival in a matter of days - which would mean a long shopping day for him, to get the foodstuffs he now required - but also for the Summer Sun Programme.  Good thing these longs nights was something he had little difficulty in dealing with.  With that, he set himself to work, sometimes wondering if he should ask Molly and/or George over for dinner when Clemens turned up, he’d certainly want that to happen.  Come to think of it, he'd be around for when the Second Debate was due, he might want to see it, perhaps provide some emotional support.  Maybe things could still work out for the best after all…</p>
