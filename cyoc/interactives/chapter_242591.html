<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From where they sat on the shelf, amongst a collection of other plush toys, neither could really see much of the room. What Jeff could see was limited to part of the wall and ceiling, as he&#39;d appeared lying on his side. Believing what he where he was was his sister&#39;s room, he waited for her and her friends to come in.<br />
<br />
Next to him, also lying on his side, Alan was unable to see anything except the wall a inch or so from his muzzle. Wanting to shift so he had a better view, he thought { do you think it&#39;d be all right if I tried to moved }<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t respond at first, and Alan was about to repeat his question when the other finally thought { probably best to remain where you are. I&#39;m sure Riley and the others with be in any minute now } and with the matter, the two forced themselves to remain as still as they waited.<br />
<br />
Time slipped by, though, in their forms as a plush otter and raccoon, it was hard for either to tell, as any internal clock they&#39;d had was removed as being nonessential. Jeff knew time was ticking by as the room grew darker and darker, whilst Alan had the barest of inkling due to how close he was to the wall and how his vision was already limited. Wondering why his sister and her friends still hadn&#39;t shown up, Jeff was caught off guard when Alan thought { so, are we just going to lie here, waiting }<br />
<br />
Not sure what else they could do, Jeff was about to ask if Alan had any suggestions. But, before he could, they both heard a noise. If he&#39;d still been able to smile, Jeff would&#39;ve as he realised what he was hearing was a door opening. Muffled noises he couldn&#39;t make out, but thought was someone talking far off greeted him, followed by a girl&#39;s voice saying, &quot;All right,&quot; and he wondered first why his hearing was messed up, then who it was talking, as they didn&#39;t sound like his sister. Wondering if it was one of her friends, he was tempted to inch closer to the edge to get a better look, but restraining himself, Jeff waited.<br />
<br />
His wait not long, as both he and Alan heard something thump beneath them, then the head of the person appeared. Seeing it wasn&#39;t his sister, Jeff had enough time to wonder, &quot;Who the hell is that?&quot; before they scooped him, Alan, and a bunch of the other plush off the shelf.<br />
<br />
The girl taking them over to her bed, Jeff and Alan were treated in the process to a better view of the room. Suddenly realising he wasn&#39;t looking at his sister&#39;s room, Jeff tried to figure out what had gone wrong as the girl forced his plush body into a doll&#39;s dress. Hating he was being dressed the way he was, complete with a pair of pink panties with a hole for his tail, Jeff would have laughed if he could have when the girl, prattling on about tea parties, pretending to be a mommy, and other things, but a doll&#39;s nappy on Alan, the dressed him in a pink and white bodysuit style pyjama. Cradling Alan, exclaiming as she did, &quot;There. Now Nita is dressed and ready for bed,&quot; Jeff listened as his friend demanded { what the hell went wrong } as he was laid in a toy crib and the girl pretended to bottle feed him.<br />
<br />
Jeff, having no idea, thought { I&#39;m not sure } as the girl tucked Alan in and kissed him goodnight then turned and collected Jeff and the other plush toys.<br />
<br />
Setting him done in a plastic chair in front of table, the girl said to Jeff, &quot;Have some tea, Silvia,&quot; as she proceeded to poured into a plastic cup a pretend serving of tea from a toy teapot. Arranging next her other plush, and addressing each in turn, Jeff thought, { this is embarrassing }<br />
<br />
From Alan came the immediate response of, { hey, at least you&#39;re not dressed like a baby, so don&#39;t start complaining }<br />
<br />
{ yeah, well, we wouldn&#39;t be in this predicament if you hadn&#39;t wanted to crash Riley&#39;s sleep over } Jeff shot back.<br />
<br />
This shutting Alan up for the moment, Jeff watched as the girl continued to serve him tea then, afterward, she stood and began to undress. Wanting to turn away, not wanting to have to see what was clearly a five- or six-year-old girl nude, Jeff was forced to watch as she pulled on tights, a bodysuit and a tutu. Prancing around for a bit before stopping to pull on the slippers, Jeff wondered what he&#39;d have to endure next, and was relieved when all the girl did was arrange him and the others so they were facing her as she put on an impromptu show.<br />
<br />
How long this went on, Jeff had no idea, as the girl went from one thing to the next. Playing dress-up, and forced into a doll&#39;s princess costume, Jeff wondered, not for the first time, how much longer this could go on. As the girl started to change, Jeff was hit with a blast of air as the door to room was opened and female voice instructed, &quot;Time to start getting ready for bed, Riley,&quot; to which the girl made a whining noise and started to beg to stay up a little longer. Listening to this, and not caring about most of it, Jeff thought he might have an idea as to what had happened.<br />
<br />
From where he lay still in the crib, Alan thought {so this is Riley&#39;s room and her name is Riley }, to which Jeff added { just not my sister, Riley }, and there mental messages going back and forth, they tried to sort out what had gone wrong before Jeff speculated, { maybe we ended up in her room because I didn&#39;t specify my sister } { I told the Chronivac Riley, but didn&#39;t give it a last name }<br />
<br />
This making the most sense to both of them, Alan asked after a bit, { so what are we going to do now }<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could answer, he was scooped up and tossed onto the bed. And as Riley picked up her other toys, Jeff mulled over their options before putting forth, { we could make a break for it, try to find our way back to my place and the Chronivac }<br />
<br />
Alan replied, then asked, { would that even work } { and how would it look if we are caught the way we currently are }<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t have an answer to this, and as Riley returned, now dressed in a nightgown, Jeff thought { I guess our only other option is to wait out the time until we change back } as the girl undressed him, put the pink panties back on him, then dressed him in a white nightgown with pink cuffs and neckline and printing stating &quot;Pretty One&quot; on the front.<br />
<br />
Thoughts on what he could do, ought to do, not liking what he had on, Jeff was forced under the covers. Riley crawling in shortly after, he listened as someone approached, heard a kissing sound, the other female voice asking, &quot;Did you go potty?&quot; which left Jeff scared the girl might pee all over him, then Riley saying, &quot;Uh huh,&quot; followed by the person Jeff assumed was the girl&#39;s mother bidding her goodnight and sweet dreams.<br />
<br />
Light clicked off, leaving the room dark except for the soft glow of a night light, Jeff still didn&#39;t know what to do. Listening as the girl&#39;s breathing evened, and somehow able to tell as her body sent him signals she was dropping off to sleep, he waited until he knew she was fully asleep before wiggling out from under the covers. Free, he inched to where he believed the edge of the bed was, misjudged and fell over the side. His plush body striking the floor, Jeff wasn&#39;t the least bit surprised it didn&#39;t hurt. Forcing himself up, thinking he&#39;d have to go about on all fours, what did surprise him was how he could still move about on two legs. Taking the tottering steps in the direction he believed the crib was, he thought, { where are you } and when his friend answered him, he sent the message { can you move a little so I can better find you }<br />
<br />
Scanning the dark, he watched as seconds after he made his request a form rose up and in a clumsy manner, crawled out of the doll&#39;s crib. Heading in their direction, he waited a moment before asking { so now what should do } { stay } { or make a break for it }</p>
