<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, it certainly is-colorful,” Kevin said as he and Sally walked into the room Mr. Beck had assigned them in the Clown Wing.<br />
<br />
If anything, that was an understatement. The walls of the roomed were striped and polka dotted, the ceiling and carpet were tie-dyed and swirled in an explosion of color that looked like a paint factory had exploded. Hanging on the walls were various portraits of clowns and circus scenes.<br />
<br />
Sally investigated the two closets filled with the various clown clothes provided by the resort. “Well Dad, it looks like you were wrong; we didn’t need all that luggage after all.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just glad they’re holding it in storage until we leave.” Jason placed the blue satchel he’d been carrying then tossed the pink one to his daughter. “Go ahead and change; Mr. Beck said our transformations start soon after we enter the room.”<br />
<br />
Sally nodded and walked into the bathroom. Kevin took off his shoes, socks, pants, briefs, shirt and finally his t-shirt. Opening the blue satchel, he was it was filled with nearly tent sized boxer shorts and tank tops, all striped polka dotted, or swirled in various colors like the motif of the room.<br />
<br />
‘How fitting,’ Kevin thought, ‘they make even our underwear look clown-like.’<br />
<br />
He took out a pair of blue boxers with red polka dots and a yellow tank-top with thin green stripes. The elastic waistband of the boxers hung loosely about him, and the top was nearly three times too big, yet he could feel the cloth was very elastic.<br />
<br />
Sally came old dressed in a leotard that was red on one side and yellow on the other, she had taken her hair out of the ponytail.<br />
<br />
She giggled at the sight of her father. “Dad, heheyaha, you look like you’re wearing a circus tent, heheyaha.” She clapped a hand over her mouth; her voice sounded higher, as if she had inhaled helium.<br />
<br />
“Sally, heheyaha,” Kevin’s own voice was now a pitch deeper and with a jolly lilt, “I think the change is starting, heheyaha.”<br />
<br />
A wave of giddiness unlike anything either of them felt before swept over the two. “Dad, heheyaha, I feel.... funny, heheyaha.”<br />
<br />
First to change was their complexions: Sally’s skin became a pale pink hue with white ovals around her eyes and a white muzzle around her mouth; while Kevin&#39;s own body became white matching the spots on Sally&#39;s face, from head to toe.<br />
<br />
Next, they gained weight, filling out their underclothes. Sally mostly in the chest and hips, gaining at least size CCC breasts and wide hips that filled her leotard, making her voluptuous if somewhat chubby for a twelve-year-old. Kevin’s waist expanded to at least a size seventy, the elastic waistband now feeling tight against an enormous beer belly, and the formerly loose boxers and top now felt snug on his new girth.<br />
<br />
Markings appeared on their face, completing their ‘makeup.’ Thin black arches appeared over Sally’s white eyepatches, replacing her eyebrows and her eyelids were shaded a light blue. Her eyes were outlined in black, soft red blushed the apples of her plump cheeks, while her lower lip inside her muzzle became a bright red with a little circle on each end giving Sally a dainty clown smile.<br />
<br />
Reddish orange ovals formed around Kevin&#39;s eyes that stretched halfway up his forehead and were topped with wide black arches, giving him a surprised look. A big red clown smile stretched from his lower lip to his chin and reached from cheek to cheek, both of which were rouged a deep red which rather suited his fleshy face.<br />
<br />
Next their hair thickened and curled; Sally&#39;s coiled tightly into ringlets and faded from its soft brown color with silver highlights. Kevin&#39;s in contrasts, formed into a bushy &#39;afro&#39; that was a variety of colors from green, to pink, to red, to blue, to yellow, and orange.<br />
<br />
To Sally&#39;s disappointment her father didn&#39;t go bald.<br />
<br />
Their feet quickly expanded and widened; Kevin had size 20 clown feet with toes about seven inches wide. Sally’s feet were shorter, about size 15, but her toes were wider by at least three inches.<br />
<br />
Finally, a loud POP! filled the room. Kevin and Sally blinked, then saw that each now had a big, shiny red clown nose. Kevin’s was nearly the size of a peach, Sally’s more like a plum.<br />
<br />
The newly clowned father and daughter just stared at each other for nearly a minute. Finally, Sally touched her nose and gave a squeeze. Honk!<br />
<br />
Gingerly, Kevin touched his own nose; it felt leathery to his fingers and nearly filled his hand. He squeezed it. Honk! it sounded, louder and deeper than Sally’s. He felt something else too, a wave of almost sexual pleasure coursing through his body.<br />
<br />
Sally walked over to her father; with her sudden weight gain and big feet she moved with a funny waddle. She looked up and examined her father like he was a statue or pther piece of art she was admiring. &quot;Dad, heheyaha, you look really good heheyaha.&quot; She reached and poked him in his bulbous red clown nose. Honk!<br />
<br />
Kevin next poked his daughter’s own nose. Honk! She poked him back. Honk! The whiteface father and auguste daughter spent the next several minutes laughing and honking each other’s noses; they were both SSSSOOOO funny.<br />
<br />
Finally, they stopped. “What are we, going to do now Dad, heheyaha?” Sally asked then honked her nose.<br />
<br />
Kevin sighed. Honking his nose had awakened this strange feeling inside him. Since Sally’s mother had died two years ago in a car accident he’d seldom dated and was mostly celibate. Now, he felt the desire to go meet a woman, clown or otherwise, take her back to this room and-.<br />
<br />
Kevin quickly banished the thoughts from his head. He’d come here to be with his little girl; he’d have time for that stuff later.<br />
<br />
Spying the closets full of clown clothes he said, “Heheyaha, we might as well get dressed, heheyaha.”<br />
<br />
HONK HONK!</p>
