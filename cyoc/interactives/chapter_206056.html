<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Changing the world sounded way to daunting for Jeff to really comprehend. It was way too much power and influence for a single individual to have, and the ideas were limitless and endless. Both benevolent ideas and fetish desires could be considered and it was purely up to Jeff which he went with.<br />
<br />
Considering that however, Jeff ultimately went with an idea he had for a while. One he had written stories about in anonymous story sharing sites as a way to keep them around. Revolving around, Diapers, Sissies and Milfs, Jeff inputed the basic world building of the story.<br />
<br />
The first and most important thing about the new world is that everyone wore diapers because everyone is incontinence, both urinary and fecal. Whenever someone needed to go, they went and their was no controlling when or where it happened. There are some patterns to it however, as during times when someone is in a highly emotional state (sadness, anger, extreme joy) then it&#39;s more likely more urine and feces comes out and quite a mess is made. As a result everyone wore diapers and it was never seen as weird.<br />
<br />
Due to the reliance on diapers, toilets and urinals no longer exist, not even on a ceceptual level. The idea of relieving oneself in anything other then a diaper or on the floor (if the individual has taken their diaper off) is looked at weirdly. Instead, public restrooms are no longer gender divided and are places where men and women will be able to change diapers without inconveniencing anyone. They are large rooms with benches and drains, with provided sinks. Typically people bring their own diapers to change into but some provide their own cheap and plain diapers to accommodate those that forget their own.<br />
<br />
These combined restrooms are also a result of different perceptions of clothes and nudity. Clothes still exist, but are designed to be easily removed as to provide easy access to the diaper if it needs changing. Due to people changing diapers when they need to, no one bothers about covering up their privates. They are covered up by the diaper, but while changing diapers, it isn&#39;t a problem if people see each others&#39; genitalia. Sex however, is still very much a private matter.<br />
<br />
Jeff finished the main key difference of the new world but wasn&#39;t done. Physically, there were also key differences in the appearance of each gender that would be changed to accommodate the fantasy. The first case being the men.<br />
<br />
Men in the new world would be femboy Sissies. What this means is that instead of muscles and facial hair, during puberty only their balls and penis grow and they typically don&#39;t get taller than 5&#39;5&quot;. Their bodies would be considered androgynous in the current, however they won&#39;t be in the new world. The men&#39;s new bodies may even gain some mass around the hips and even grow breasts, though these breasts won&#39;t larger than a B cup. Going back to the genitalia, in the new world, men&#39;s penises and balls griw much larger than they do in the old world. These new penis sizes do a lot more harm tgan good though as when erect, they can cause a lot of pissing to happen, and van make the man even more aroused. Other changes are that Men like to grow out their hair and wear feminine clothes, in fact the only clothes they wear are feminine and old male fashion doesn&#39;t exist. What men wear is feminine clothes that fit their new sissy looks.<br />
<br />
Speaking of sissy, the word &#39;sissy&#39; is no longer and insult but a compliment. A compliment that when told to a man from a women, causes such a high euphoria that the man will break down into a pissing and shitting mess as they buckle under the weight of their Joy. Due to this and a combination of their penis sizes, Men&#39;s diapers are a lot baggier than women&#39;s. They are huge and make physical activities quite difficult so men typically are known to do jobs that aren&#39;t physically demanding. Office jobs, hairdressing and jobs that don&#39;t require much movement are very make dominated, even if sone may not have been in the old world.<br />
<br />
As for women on the other hand, things are different. Up until puberty, a female will develop like they do in the old world, only difference being that they wear diapers. Once they hit puberty, a massive development is underwent by their body.<br />
<br />
Their bodies quickly grow in a few years and their breasts start increase in size, reaching a minimum of  G cup. Their bodies get plum in all the right ways as they develop to look like a stereotypical milf. A side effect of this is that women will produce milk, and lots of it, in a way that is similar to producing urine. It still looks like breast milk and chemically is the same, but women have no control over it and it can make a mess of things. This resulted in the creation of bras that are padded and act like diapers, but for breast milk. In fact, some companies have developed a kind of diaper that is like a very padded slingshot bikini. Besides what has been said, everything else is the same as the old world for women.<br />
<br />
Sex is also a subject that woukd slightly change as while sex is mostly the same, watersports is a very common event during sex, albeit out of circumstances of the incontinence and not something that people necessarily enjoy. Though then again, people in the new world love possing over their loved ones and getting pissed on by them.<br />
<br />
With that, Jeff was almost finished except some last changes that he forgot to add. Some of these changes include having toddler clothes be made for adult sizes (eg, sundresses that expose the diaper, baby tops etc) and how their are diapers that can be washed and reused. Sone Men and women alike love wearing clothes that show off their diapers like the sundresses, while other people wear bumshirts or jeans where the diaper sticks out of it due to the size of them.<br />
<br />
One last thing that Jeff wanted for himself specifically was that his new firm would be a femboy, dressed in clothes that are like clothes a Disney princess would wear. Some of his favourite clothes being ones Alice from Alice in wonderland would wear. This also meant he would change is hair to a natural golden blonde and his penis and balls would be on the upper end of how large the new penises would be.<br />
<br />
At this point, he was done and wanted to see the changes happen to the new world.</p>
