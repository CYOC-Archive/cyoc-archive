<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the adult Gloria now sat with her family, numerous questions now swirled around. How did she plan to get the teens home? How much had things changed? All these questions and more were now voiced as the Turners talked in the living room.<br />
<br />
“So how much have things changed,” Lynne asked quietly. The adult Gloria gazed warmly at her sister, seeing how nervous the girl looked. “A lot Lynne,” she said. “But I don’t want you to worry okay? Yes you did alter the future, the thing you were so worried about never happened. But other things changed as well, that’s what we’re worried about.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of things changed,” Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
“Well the epilepsy is new,” the adult Gloria sighed. “But that wasn’t Lynne’s fault. Also some relationships changed as well. All for the best mind you But things have definitely altered. I’m worried that when Lynne and the others return it could be a complete shock to them.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and the others sat quietly as they gazed at one another. If things were changing in the future they worried that their actions could still cause harm. One thing that concerned Gloria though was the reason Lynne had appeared in the first place, working up enough courage Gloria looked firmly at her adult self.<br />
<br />
“Um Gloria,” she asked. “I have to know, who died in your future?”<br />
<br />
Lynne and the adult Gloria gazed nervously at one another before quickly answering Gloria. “You don’t need to know,” they said. Teen Gloria sighed as she now stood to address the two time travelers. “Look,” she said firmly. “You said that the future changed so that that person is alive. I need to know who it was. If the future changed then it won’t matter and if it hasn’t then we can look out for the person. Regardless, it’s time we find out the whole truth.”<br />
<br />
The adult Gloria sighed, she wasn’t sure if she should reveal this bit of information. Yes the future had changed, yes Lynne had saved that person but with the future changing so much their was a concern that it could always change back. Sighing Gloria decided it would be best if everyone knew. “Okay I’ll tell you.”<br />
<br />
“Um Glo are you sure that’s such a great idea,” Lynne said cautiously. “I mean from what I heard if we say anything then we won’t be able to save that person.”<br />
<br />
“Lynne it will be okay,” Gloria countered. “The future is in such flux right now that the chances of that person dying are remote at best. That person is safe, unfortunately I don’t know if everyone else is.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean everyone else,” Lisa asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“It’s complicated,” Adult Gloria sighed. “But I’ll try to keep it simple. Basically anyone that’s come back to the past so far is safe from anything happening to them. That’s why the Davis’s, mom and dad, and me have been able to come back in time, nothing bad happens to us we’re alive. Everyone else is at risk though and that includes Katie.”<br />
<br />
“Wait Katie could die,” Lisa exclaimed in alarm.<br />
<br />
“Possibly,” Gloria muttered sadly. “It’s a remote chance. You see in the original timeline it was....Felicia.”<br />
<br />
The Turners gasped as adult Gloria now relayed the story of the original future. In that timeline Morgan LeFay attacked around the end of freshman year. When she did she attempted to take Lisa’s unborn child. Gloria paused as she now tried to think of how to explain things. Lynne and her knew that the Kellie from the other timeline and her friends helped drive the sorceress off. Their actions saved Lisa and Lynne, it was also why Lisa had chosen the name Lynne as a name. The other Katie and Lisa in the other timeline had put their lives on the line to help her, to honor those two she had chosen the name Lynne in rememberance of their deceased mother. Considering Lisa and Jason had not yet been made aware who Kellie was Gloria decided to keep that bit of information to herself. For now she would only tell of Felicas fate.<br />
<br />
“So you are already aware of Morgan LeFay right,” Gloria asked cautiously to which everyone nodded. “Okay good, that makes things easier. Basically Felicia tried to buy you time as you escaped. She threw herself in front of Lisa to keep her safe. She succeeded but...it cost her her life. After that everyone was devastated. Yes Lisa and Lynne were safe but a part of us just never recovered. We all watched as her boyfriend Adam held the girl in his arms as she died. It both brought us together and destroyed us at the same time.”<br />
<br />
“That’s why I came back here,” Lynne said quietly. “My whole life I watched as everyone would get really sad around June. Felicia meant so much to everyone that her passing changed how everyone was. If she could be brought back then maybe everyone would be happy again.”<br />
<br />
“Felicia being alive did make everyone happy Lynne,” Gloria soothed. “We all still remember the original timeline so that when Felicia showed up we were elated. However things are constantly changing. The timeline is in flux, I couldn’t even travel back here because....it wasn’t a guarantee that I would survive the year.”<br />
<br />
“Wait I could die,” teen Gloria exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Well Not now,” the adult Gloria said quickly. “Thankfully our sister and Sasha saw to that when they got you to the hospital in time. So thanks for saving my life sis.”<br />
<br />
Lynne went slightly pale as she looked at her sister. The teens actions had almost killed her sister and then saved her. It was a lot to take in that her actions had such far reaching consequences. The adult Gloria could see the lol of worry on her young face and quickly grabbed the teens hands squeezing them. “Lynne listen,” she soothed. “You did nothing wrong. You saved me, you coming back here didn’t put me at risk, it saved me okay so stop being so worried. I’m not mad and neither is anyone else.”<br />
<br />
“But you could of died,” she whimpered her eyes beginning to dampen with tears.<br />
<br />
“And I didn’t  because of you,” the adult Gloria smiled. “So I guess I owe you.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jason said slowly. “So your saying that some people in the future are safe but not others. How do we go about making sure everyone else is okay? You said Katie and some of the others could still die in this timeline so what’s your plan?”<br />
<br />
“My theory,” Gloria stated. “Is that by taking the kids back we would be able to cement the future that I have now. In that time everyone we know is alive and well. By me being able to come back here I know that I’m save in the future. I might be able to use my magic to ensure thatbLynne and the others are safe too. But, their could be some complications.”<br />
<br />
“What complications,” Lisa asked raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Gloria sighed, this was the hard part of the spell and the part she worried about the most. “Unfortunately Lynne and the others have become part of our history now,” she whispered. “We all have memories now of their time here. I may be able to bring them home but if I can’t it’s because they have things left to do here or something else.”<br />
<br />
“What’s the something else,” teen Gloria asked fearfully.<br />
<br />
“It means that me or one of my friends may not survive the year,” Lynne said sadly. “That’s what your worried about isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
The adult aglira nodded sadly as she looked at her sister. “Yeah,” she said sadly. “That’s What has me worried. Lynne the future is changing so much that their is a possibility that you may not survive. I don’t want to lose you so I’m going to try to bring you and the others home. There is a chance though I may not be able to, if that’s the case I need you to be careful until your born.”<br />
<br />
Lynne nodded stoically, she understood that these kind of spells could be dangerous. While she was willing to accept the consequences of her actions she needed to make sure her friends were safe. If nothing else she would see to it that her friends were safe. “Okay Gloria,” she said firmly. “Let’s get the others and try to send them home. Before that though we should talk, in private.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded as she gazed at her little sister. The sisters would talk after which they would cast the spell, one that would hopefully get everyone home safely.</p>
