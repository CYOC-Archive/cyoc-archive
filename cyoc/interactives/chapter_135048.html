<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a fantastic 4th of July wedding, Jil and Beauregard were eager to head to their honeymoon. Not in the least bit because Jill was eager to convert her new husband into a handsome bull alligator. Thankfully, Beauregard had a family friend who owned his own seaplane and after the party, the newlyweds were able to fly from New Orleans to Kingston, Jamaica.<br />
<br />
It was pretty easy for the seaplane to land and even easier for the newlyweds to unload their luggage. Beauregard had packed light as his gator body will most likely be bigger than his human body. Jill had bought him some swim trunks from Lyre that were designed lizard Animalians. Assuming his tail wasn&#39;t too thick, it would be enough modesty for him until Jill could take his measurements and order him some new clothes delivered.<br />
<br />
The hotel manager was expecting them to show up. They had booked a honeymoon suite and it was pretty easy to remember a gator woman doing part of the booking. &quot;Ya&#39;ll gonna love dis place,&quot; said the manager, his voice having the rich Rasta accent that Jamaica is well-known for, &quot;We got de pool cleaned and put in fresh water. You gators don&#39;t like de chlorinated stuff, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can tolerate it more than some other animals, but we still prefer clean water,&quot; said Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, just so you know, I may look...different in the morning,&quot; said Beauregard.<br />
<br />
The manager winked and said, &quot;Of course ya will, mon. It&#39;s your honeymoon. You gotta please de big bride and get bigger yaself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s one way to put it,&quot; said Beauregard as he collected the room keys.<br />
<br />
The manager waved them off and said, &quot;See ya later, alligators.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you often get that?&quot; asked Beauregard as he and Jill walked to their suite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty often,&quot; said Jill, &quot;It only annoys me when they say &#39;after a while, crocodile&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After getting things settled, Jill and Beauregard decided to get straight to business. Jill admitted she was feeling a bit self-conscious. Beauregard had seen her wearing sexy dressed and even swimwear, but he had never seen her naked before. It was probably her self-confidence to blame, but Jill hadn&#39;t gotten the same casualness that other Animalians had about nudity yet. She didn&#39;t really had to be embarrassed about her body. Like other Animalian women, she was a good combination of fitness and curves. Even the breasts that otherwise shouldn&#39;t belong on a reptile were large and round. But Jill still felt a little shy to be naked in front of everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just fine,&quot; said Beauregard soothingly, &quot;If anything, it&#39;s me who should be worried about not bein&#39; up to snuff.&quot; He wasn&#39;t out of the shape, but he just exercised enough to keep himself from being flabby. Jill was no expert on penis sizes, but she was pretty sure Beauregard was considered average. &quot;You did remember the counter-vaccine, right?&quot; asked Beauregard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and there&#39;s vaccines for us both afterwards,&quot; said Jill, &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone would be happy with us infecting the rest of the guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only one who&#39;s gonna be changed is your husband, Mrs. Shucks,&quot; said Beauregard.<br />
<br />
Jill felt a shudder of happiness. It set her a-tingle to be called that. &quot;Then maybe you should stop waiting and come get some,&quot; said Jill in an alluring tone.<br />
<br />
Beauregard smiled before lightly massaging Jill&#39;s breasts. Jill moaned. He had a pretty gentle touch and yet stimulating enough for her to feel it through her tough scales. She jumped a little when Beauregard licked her nipple before sucking on it. Jill moaned as she felt her husband&#39;s back. She soon felt some changes happening, his back hardening with scales and small rows of spikes. The teeth lightly nibbling at her nipple were already starting to feel sharper. Jill reached down to feel Beauregard&#39;s dick. It was already starting to feel longer and his balls were starting to retract into his body. &quot;Looks like someone&#39;s ready to work,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
With a growl, Beauregard pushed her backwards with more force than Jill was expecting. She landed on the bed and looked up to see her husband with a feral smile that showed more teeth than a human should have. &quot;Then let&#39;s stop playin&#39; around,&quot; said Beauregard with a growl before plunging into Jill. Jill gasped as he penetrated deep. But the sudden shock was replaced by great pleasure as he started thrusting into her.<br />
<br />
She was fascinated by the man she knew so well transforming above her. Scales were rapidly spreading across Beauregard&#39;s body. Muscles that didn&#39;t really show started bulking up and getting more defined. Jill could feel the hands gripping her waist growing claws. It was a bit bizarre watching Beauregard&#39;s face stretch out into an alligator snout, even if he kept his hair. Jill couldn&#39;t see it, but she could imagine Beauregard&#39;s tail growing out, eventually touching the floor. But her thoughts were mostly revolving around the big dick that was plunging into her, something she could definitely tell getting bigger. Beauregard&#39;s grunts were getting deeper and more guttural as he thrust harder. Jill was also thrusting back, feeling closer to release. Eventually, the two of them let out guttural roars as Beauregard unloaded his alligator seed deep into Jill.<br />
<br />
Jill panted as she was slowly descending from Cloud 9. Beauregard seemed faster to recover. He leaned in and said, &quot;If ya&#39;ll don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m gonna take a look at my new self.&quot; Pulling out of Jill, he walked over to the mirror. &quot;Huh, I do make a handsome gator,&quot; said Beauregard before looking down and going, &quot;What in Sam Hill?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill sat up to see what Beauregard was reacting to. He definitely made a handsome bull gator. Where she was once taller than him, now he was a head taller than her. And he was certainly more muscular, his shoulders broader than they were when he was human. Jill took special notice of his big thick tail that hung above his shapely ass. She could definitely get used to that view. But she walked over to her husband to see what was the problem. She was pretty sure it was his penis. It remained mostly human in shape and was definitely bigger than what it was before. But despite having just going off, it was still hard as a rock. But Beauregard was probably reacting to how it was white in contrast to his creamish-yellow underbelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I remember reading about that,&quot; said Jill, &quot;Apparently, that&#39;s what a gator&#39;s penis looks like. Well, the color at least. And apparently they&#39;re erect all the time. They just stay inside the body when it&#39;s not time to mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; asked Beauregard with a lusty growl, &quot;Then apparently it&#39;s still mating time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill gave an alligator grin and said, &quot;Looks like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beauregard picked up his bride with surprisingly little effort. &quot;Then I think we better keep going until it&#39;s ready to sleep,&quot; he said as he carried her to the bed. What followed was a long night of very happy alligator noises.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The next day, Beauregard wanted to show his family his new self. Fortunately, he brought his laptop and pretty soon they were chatting on Skype.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, ya&#39;ll sure got big,&quot; said his cousin, Lulu-Belle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I ain&#39;t a saltwater croc, but I think it&#39;s still a respectable size,&quot; said Beauregard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speakin&#39; of saltwater, you are gonna swim in the sea, right?&quot; asked his uncle Brandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would I be wearin&#39; these trunks if I weren&#39;t plannin&#39; on swimmin&#39;?&quot; asked Beauregard, indicating the trunks that fit his new body rather well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wearing them because they&#39;re the only clothes that fit you now,&quot; said Jill. That earned her the laughter of the rest of the Shucks family. The conversation soon turned to recent events. Apparently Animalia Ambassadoria had uncovered a secret mansion under Skull Island that a New Orleans cafe owner was hosting for illegal archeologists who had been trying to find the treasure on Skull Island. Then it turned out the treasure wasn&#39;t <i>on</i> Skull Island at all. The treasure was in a sunken ship offshore, a Spanish treasure galleon no less. The extravagant ship was named the &#39;Pride of Ferdinand&#39;. Or more properly <i>Orgullo de Fernando</i>. And it was carrying a fortune in both gold and Spanish colonial-era weapons. The ship&#39;s treasure would be going a long way to funding the Dinotopian colony that&#39;ll soon be on Skull Island while the ship will be returned to Spain.<br />
<br />
While Jill found the story very fascinating, she was a little concerned about the cafe owner. She had been a pretty good business, if on the extralegal side, only for Animalia Ambassadoria to expose her. She got off pretty lightly, being able to continue running the mansion as a hotel and restaurant. But she now had a black mark on her record and had to pay $50,000 in back taxes for her new business. This reminded Jill a lot of what happened with Heather Wilcox. Jill wasn&#39;t really close with Heather, but they talked a bit at Dr. Jones&#39;s group therapy. Heather had talked about the trouble she had gotten into when Sophie and her friends had exposed what she was up to in Costa Rica. Granted, smuggling gold and using a fake dinosaur to terrorize a museum was more serious than trespassing and dodging taxes. But Jill knew what that led up to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did anyone talk with this cafe lady?&quot; asked Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; asked Brandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, her business on Skull Island has been exposed and she now has a big debt that she has to pay and she won&#39;t be getting as much money anymore,&quot; said Jill, &quot;I reckon that&#39;s enough to put a chip on her shoulder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So? You think she&#39;s gonna turn herself into a sea monster and go after those kids?&quot; asked Lulu-Belle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not, but I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;d harbor a big grudge and that might lead to trouble somewhere,&quot; said Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not really our business,&quot; said Beauregard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s somebody&#39;s business and I&#39;d like to know if they&#39;re gonna take care of it,&quot; said Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we put in a call about it,&quot; said Beauregard, &quot;Though I&#39;m pretty sure someone else has already thought about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
After that, the conversation winded out and Beauregard&#39;s family shut down their Skype connection. &quot;You do look good in those shorts,&quot; said Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;I better,&quot; said Beauregard, &quot;How long will it take for those clothes to be delivered?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might be a few days,&quot; said Jill, &quot;But we can do a lot of swimming until then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beauregard was definitely intrigued. Jill did look pretty sexy in a bikini. &quot;Well, right after you, Mrs. Shucks,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;By all means, Mr. Shucks,&quot; replied Jill.</p>
