<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark made more plans over the time he had in class, all while Luke sat there like a statue, mentally screaming for someone to help him somehow. He had no idea that Mark had made sure nobody would notice him being there at all, not even their professor.<br />
When the lunch break begun, Mark said: “Follow me.” And Luke just did, without any control. Mark meets with Aidan before the cafeteria, as today they had planned to have their break together outside. Luke stood there, waiting with Mark for Aidan, watching him help the poor young man walking outside. Aidan ignored him as well. “Had Mark done anything to make me invisible or what? And is he responsible for Aidan´s condition? But hasn´t he always been like this?” He had no answers to any of that.<br />
When Mark reached the spot where he and Aidan had their break the day before, he pointed towards the bench with one arm, saying “Sit there” quietly while looking at Luke. Luke felt addressed enough to follow the command, not that he could act otherwise. Mark helped Aidan onto the other bench opposite of Luke´s, before sitting down next to Luke.<br />
Luke sat there in silence as Mark asked Aidan about his day so far, saying he had enjoyed the silence he had there. “Oh, so Luke is still absent? I heard he was ill over the weekend, but thought he would be there today. Normally you complain about him being blabbing to you all day.” Aidan laughed at that, and Mark joined him.<br />
“Oh, he was or is ill? That would explain the silence I enjoy right now. He can´t blab on me while not being there.” Mark then grinned at Luke, who didn´t understand how Aidan could still ignore him, sitting opposite if him. And it hurt a bit to know Mark was simply annoyed by him and gossiped about it to Aidan, but never really said so to him. He had, but Luke still didn´t realize how much Mark had done that, as he had simply ignored it.<br />
When Aidan was occupied with his lunch, the other portion of the curry he made the evening before, Mark turned towards Luke again, grinning evilly. He could just start the changes, and Aidan wouldn´t notice him talking to Luke, as to him, Luke wasn´t even there, and talking to him would be ignored by Aidan.<br />
“As you noticed, you are under my full control, and nobody beside myself will take notice of you. Even that I speak with you will be ignored, so no one can help you, Luke.” Mark´s evil grin got even wider, if possible, seeing Luke´s eyes widen in fear. “Don´t worry, I won´t harm you in any way. I will just not give you your control back, at least not without a few changes.”<br />
Mark knew Luke would either be running now, escaping him, or would be too curious about what Mark could do and stay, if he had any control. But seeing him as he was silent and completely helpless, completely at Mark´s mercy, turned him on further. Aidan would get a nice big dessert in a few minutes.<br />
“First things first. As the reason you are in this situation is your annoying habit of babbling all the time and ignoring my tries to stop you. Let´s see, you can´t speak freely anymore, you are only able to speak if someone asks you anything, and you are then forced to tell the truth or what you believe the truth is, Luke.” Mark started off easy. It would stop Luke from speaking all the time.<br />
To Luke, who felt a slight crawling inside his neck, that wasn´t as little as Mark thought. But he could do nothing as his mind applied this command. He could tell that he wouldn´t be able to speak without being asked anymore, it just was there like a muzzle would hold a dog quiet.<br />
Mark added as an afterthought: “What you can´t talk about, whatever you are asked about it, is what happened to you, what I do to you or if you notice it, others. It wouldn´t do if anyone figures something out, after all.”<br />
With that, Luke´s only hope of escaping the changes, by telling someone else to free him in a way, evaporated. If he couldn´t say he had been changed by Mark, how could he get help? He still had no idea how Mark could change him, anyway. So, his only way out would be to run from Mark, never seeing him again.<br />
Mark saw the spark of hope in Luke´s eyes, and, interpreting it right, followed with: “Now, to make sure of it, you won´t be able to run from me, and have to come to me if I order you to do so. You will be able to hear me calling for you, regardless where the both of us are, and will be forced to come to me as quickly as you can and obey any command that I give you without question. You can only leave my side if I allow you to go. And you will never be able to figure out how I control you, and will forget it if I ever tell you.”<br />
That finally crushed Luke´s hope of ever becoming free of Mark´s control. If he couldn´t figure out how he did it, he couldn´t break out of it, right? And being forced to obey Mark´s every command, as well as hearing him call wherever they were. He would be like a slave to him than anything else.<br />
Mark grinned at Luke´s crushed look. He seemed to have understood that he couldn´t break free. Now he could start with his real changes for Luke. Before he really could, however, he noticed Aidan looking at him hopefully, his liquefied curry container empty on the table.<br />
Mark laughed at Aidan´s face, asking: “You are already finished with your drink? If that look is about getting your dessert, go ahead, I don´t mind it, Aidan.”<br />
Aidan couldn´t move fast enough, vanishing under the table. Next, Mark had to lift his ass a bit for Aidan to slip his jeans down, even if he had some trouble with the button through his stiff sock-gloves. Soon, Aidan was happily sucking Mark off, who turned his eyes back onto Luke.<br />
Luke, at first not understanding what Mark meant with dessert, was shocked when he saw Aidan sucking Mark off. What the hell had Mark done to Aidan? He had already thought Mark controlled Aidan as well, but it seemed to be different. Aidan had waited for the confirmation that he could suck Mark off, and not just started. And Mark hadn´t ordered him, either. Had he somehow planted that deep into Aidan´s mind?<br />
A short while later, after Aidan had gotten his dessert, Mark helped him back to the uni, while ordering Luke to follow him again. Aidan was left on the corridor to his class, while Mark and Luke continued the other way to their class.<br />
After sitting in his seat, Mark ordered Luke to sit in his own and wait for his next instructions. As Mark now had proof that nobody took notice of Luke or him talking with him, he could continue his plans in the class instead of waiting for its end.<br />
Having an idea what was troubling Luke the whole time, Mark grinned as he explained: “Aidan loves his dessert in the form of my cum, that´s why he waited to be allowed to get it. Don´t worry, I don´t plan on you sucking me off, you are not my type anyway. You will have another role to fill for me.”<br />
That didn´t really ease Luke´s mind. While he was soothed that he wouldn´t act as a sex-slave or -toy to Mark, what other role did he plan to give him? He feared that he wouldn´t like it any way, but not knowing was hard for his curious mind.<br />
Mark had no reason to rush things with Luke now, instead deciding to let him wait longer. So, the only command he gave him was “Take notes for me, as detailed as possible.”<br />
And so, Luke sat there writing everything down for him, forced to concentrate on the lesson to make said notes, while Mark worked on his plans again.</p>
