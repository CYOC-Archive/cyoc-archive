<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James and Penny had been playing dungeons and dragons since the seventh grade and had grown quite adept at playing it with just two people. Immediately they both called dungeon master and glanced at each other not willing to back down.<br />
<br />
“Arm wrestle you for it!” Penny exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“You’re on!” James retorted and suddenly the two of them had memories of arm wrestling for every tie breaker they’d ever had to force. Their arms shifted in size bulging a little from the twigs they’d been earlier and the two sat down at a table and immediately got to it. As far as they were concerned they’d alternated between victories all their lives but with a simple statement James changed that, “You know i’ll Win right?”<br />
<br />
With that his arms got bigger and hers got smaller. This had been their go to contest for years but two years ago a growth spurt had given James the edge and it was just Penny’s competitive personality keeping the tradition going.<br />
<br />
They locked arms and though she put up a good fight Penny ended up losing and gave a huff as James laughed and took a seat at the head of the table. There were five seats that were usually occupied by the two of them and three of James’ brother’s friends. The guys were absolute masters at the game and though Penny and James were good the four older guys were better.<br />
<br />
What James didn’t realize was that though he knew Penny well and thought he had been playing with her for ears there was still a little social anxiety wracking his body leftover from before Penny was changed by Candice. James swallowed and like he was an awkward kid at a dance he randomly commented on the heat in the basement. Almost immediately Penny grew beads of sweat and felt the heat. She rubbed her forehead off as another gap in her personality was filled. She now liked the cold and wintertime. During the Summer things go too hot and she would either spend time in the pool or in an air conditioned house.<br />
<br />
This new reality caused things to change once again. Now Penny was comfortable in a swim suit and because James’ family set up a pool in the back yard he had seen her in bikinis countless times. Often they’d play D & D and she would remain in a bikini at that table while they all ate popsicles and tried to keep cool. Suddenly Penny was removing her dress shirt leaving her in her undershirt which had no sleeves and reminded James of his attraction to the freckles on her shoulders. As he watched her his dick became erect and he noticed she had a dark bra on. Being her best friend he suddenly had the desire to tease her about this.<br />
<br />
“I can see you bra,” He laughed mockingly and she looked down.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Darn I’m not used to these new bras yet,” Penny laughed.<br />
<br />
“You go through another girly growth spurt?” James asked teasingly and suddenly both the Bra and Penny’s breasts grew to a simple B Cup. It looked absolutely lovely on her and suddenly James had a great deal of attraction to her. The gaps in Penny’s life were almost filled now. Memories of enjoying the snow, loving to swim, and being comfortable in her own body filled her. Now she was recalling a hatred for shopping. Being dragged to the store by her mother and being forced into a thousand and one articles of clothing she didn’t want or need. The bras had been the most recent of these. Penny was almost complete as a person and by now James was completely infatuated with her knowing he had a crush on her for years. Penny was often oblivious to this but it was almost too much for James as his Cock grew harder and harder from the sight of his best friend, coworker, and crush. His hand shot out and touched hers. An electric spark shot through them as the final gaps in Penny’s personality filled in. Suddenly they were standing up near the couch and she was pulling her sweat covered shirt off revealing her black bra underneath. She cocked her hip to the side and grinned at him while he rubbed her waist delicately.<br />
<br />
“Okay, last one to cum gets to be dungeon master,” She smirked and James just reached up and removed her glasses before planting a kiss on her lips. They held it for a few seconds before he pulled back and looked into her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Do you really think this is a good idea, I mean we’re just friends...” James trailed before she shushed him and smiled.<br />
<br />
“As of right now we’re boyfriend and girlfriend,” she smiled before removing her pants and exposing herself to him. He peeled his shirt off and removed his own pants before reaching for her. She pushed him down on the beat up couch they played video games on and he removed his boxers. She reached behind her and with the unclassified of a bra her breasts were free. She toyed with them for a few seconds before reaching down and pulling her panties off. She then leaned into him. James sweat nervously and she also looked kind of nervous.<br />
<br />
“Just pretend it’s masterbating,” she said in an assured manner. James wasn’t sure if she was referring to herself or him but seconds later her vagina was hovering over his cock. She inhaled deeply before plunging her vagina onto it and locking lips with him at the same time. They both began to thrust and pleasure filled looks overcame both their faces. Soon after a spike of a pained look crossed Penny’s face but a few seconds later she was in a rhythm. They jumped at each other like this for a while before Penny pulled out and twisted around. She raised her ass into the air and James got up and stared at the round fleshy lumps. He ran his hands over them before readying his dick and sticking it back into her vagina and pumping from behind. Penny began to make loud moaning noises and her face hit the cushions as her hands traveled to her breasts and began to massage them. She was striken with pleasure and it just built and built until at exactly the sameness time they let out moans and spurts of liquid. They both collapsed on the couch panting and after a few seconds they rose.<br />
<br />
“That was a- Who-Who came first?” She asked with a dazed look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I have no idea,” James replied before they both looked at each other in a saucy manner. Penny licked her lips and rose to her feet before approaching James again. He just grinned knowing they found a new way to settle tiebreakers. And losing this one was just as good as winning it.</p>
