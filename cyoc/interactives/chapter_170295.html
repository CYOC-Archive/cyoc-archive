<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You prepare to change jonas into a semi dragon human hybrid.  You begin calculating final changes when a freak power outage occurs halting everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap&quot; you about &quot;power just failed Jonas I can&#39;t change you back&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean right now right?&quot; He asked from inside the booth<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah just for right now and I guess I have to tell you something too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ummm I sorta lost the profile for your human self it&#39;s not stored or saved and I can&#39;t make you a human again without it&quot;<br />
<br />
You expect an angry tirade but instead he makes a gurgling sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay man I was afraid of this all along so am I a commode forever now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I promise you that I can make you something cooler like a dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
You help him down off the stool then you both head for the living room again.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cool.  So once the powers back up I get.to be a dragon I can live with that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;About that I can&#39;t make you a full dragon it wouldn&#39;t fit but I can make you a hybride in fact with pics from my phone I might be able to make you just a bit like your old self.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seems to cheer the toilet up and as a pair you chat for a few hours until the lights come back on.  The whole time you are fussing with your phone adjusting models for your friends change from standard flush toilet to hybrid dragon/human.  Once the lights are back up you carry him back to the booth and situate him on the stool. Plugging your phone into the controls you let the models download over.<br />
<br />
INPUT RECEIVED WARNING CORRUPTION DETECTED IN FILES CONVERSION TO FILES IN PROGRESS PLEASE WAIT<br />
<br />
A progress screen pulls up and in the background you see the toilet morphing in shapes from standard commode.to japanese squat toilet to old fashioned high mounted tank with chain then finally to dragon human hybrid the a double arrow that flows showing the ability to morph at will into human form with attributes of a dragon.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s taking so long&quot; jonas whines from the booth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just give me a sec it&#39;s doing something odd it&#39;s like it&#39;s running change checks now it&#39;s brought up a message for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You read: SUBJECT FORM UNSTABLE PLEASE SET ALLLWANCES/CONTROLS FOR CHANGES. You ponder.this for a second and see time indications deciding it would be best to give it a long range you select long term.  It then positions you with another selection SELECT CHANGE CONTROL MECHANISM, you look to your phone and input your phone and jonas&#39; phone.  The final screen comes up ALLOW FOR CHANGE Y/N.  You type &#39;Y&#39; and hit the enter button for the change seeing it begin and close out all but one screen which to your horror shows the toilets you saw a knob and the dragon as a water dragon/human hybrid.  The machine is whirring into life as it flashes change duration up LONG TERM/ PERMANENT CHANGE IN PROGRESS<br />
SUBJECT: JONAS<br />
START FORM: LIVING TOILET <br />
END FORM: MULTICHANGE LIVING TOILET/WATERDRAGON<br />
MULTICHANGE CONTROL MECH: PHONE/HIDDEN CONTROL KNOB MIND ALTERSTION POSSIBLE<br />
CHANGE COMMENCING<br />
<br />
A strong light floods the booth and your phone begins to glow as well.  Loud whirring sounds occur and when it all settled jonas cries out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bro did it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
You stumble to the curtain and pull it back to reveal a scaled toilet with eyes that shifts briefly and becomes a squat toilet then settles as a naked dragon human hybrid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm yes it did&quot; you stammer &quot;but theres something you should know...&quot;<br />
<br />
He grips you in a strong but &quot;bro it can totally wait I could use a glass of water like right now I&#39;m parched and maybe more food&quot; he heads for the stairs you pick up his phone and your own and follow meekly.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s at your sink when you get up there naked and wagging the tail he has now gulping water like mad. In between gulps he moans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t understand why I&#39;m so thirsty all of a sudden&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod and sit at the table then go to the fridge and begin to make lunch.  He finishes with the water and sits finally watching you.  Then he pulls out a spoon and looks over himself in it.  You are making tuna salad and notice him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the new form?&quot; You ask<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure it&#39;s neat it&#39;s great I can&#39;t wait to see if I can pick up more girls or guys then before.&quot; He giggles<br />
<br />
&quot;You sit the sandwiches down and a pitcher of tea, &quot;well it&#39;s more than what you expected&quot; you say before watching him down the whole pitcher of tea belch and go to the sink to fill it with water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh guess I&#39;m really thirsty maybe that&#39;s where the water came from when I was a toilet&quot; he laughs<br />
<br />
You fiddle with your phone and find a setting to adjust his water needs briefly.  He sits with the pitcher and you go for a glass of lemonade instead.   Jonas has now tucked into his sandwich and chips and finished half the pitcher.  You eat yours slowly and then look at your friend wondering if you should just come right out and tell him.<br />
<br />
He reaches for his phone and begins playing with it before noticing the new adjustment.<br />
&quot;Hey what does this mean?&quot; He asks before hitting one of the forms he now has and in a blip of light the water dragon you are now friends with becomes a toilet again he growls.<br />
&quot;What did you do to me bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
You explain showing him on your phone then change him through all his forms including wall mount urinal and back to dragon.  He glowers at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU AND YOUR STUPID PROJECTS&quot; he shouts &quot;NOW IM A FREAK WHO&#39;S GONNA WANT A DRAGON THST TURNS INTO S TOILET MIDNIGHT WHOOO?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You look down at your feet and sigh, &quot;it&#39;s not at midnight just when the right buttons are pushed or the secret knob is twisted&quot; you reach up to one of his horns and bam a squat toilet on four dragon claw feet looks up at you and hisses before you twist the handle on its end and he is now jonas again with faint scales on his partially human face.<br />
<br />
He stands and dashes out of the room to your guest bathroom and slams the door.  You go to follow but decide s little alone time might be good for him. You clean up from lunch and begin looking in on the app and notice some extras and begin telling through the screens.<br />
<br />
One shows his status emotional, form, usage data, what hes doing and you feel a little bad to see sad listed and crying/shitting on the status.  The next screen has a countdown listed as required time in primary form for allowance in secondary form.  You flip through and realize the toilets are his primary form now and he has to spend an almost equal time as both or be stuck counting back down to the other.  It doesn&#39;t seem to have a limit you can find but you worry that if they become unbalanced you will have to wait a long time for his next change.  You rush to the bathroom door and hang on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jonas I just.found something and you&#39;re not gonna like it but it&#39;s important&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside you hear a flush and then the door clicks open &quot;come in it doesn&#39;t matter how you see me now&quot; he moped &quot;what&#39;s so important?&quot;<br />
<br />
You explain the situation with the time limits and show him an almost equal bank for them currently counting down on the dragon form.<br />
<br />
&quot;So inhabe to spend equal time or I&#39;m stuck in one vs the other?<br />
You nod and watch his shoulder sink.  He sighs hopes off the toilet and gropes for his horn then in a flash he&#39;s the toilet from yesterday again.  <br />
&quot;I might as well stay like this at least I don&#39;t have to worry about breaking things like this&quot; he moans.<br />
<br />
You sigh and nod noting the change in timers the toilet one counting up and adding more to the bank of 28:56:53.  Together you both go about the day.  Jonas hobbles down to the basement and works out how he can change from form to form on his own.  You let the man who is fixing up your .aster bathroom in to finish the job.  Then you join jonas downstairs and begin to work on the machine hoping to find his human form hoping to break his permanent change or speed up it&#39;s recharge.  <br />
<br />
Hours pass and you feel him staring at you. You look at the forlorn toilet then watch it become a dragon on its own and clink his tsloned feet as it comes over to you.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking bro I deserve something since you kinda screwed me.over.&quot; he begins &quot;and while I think revenge would be good I can&#39;t see it being really all that good in the long run so I wanna play with your toy and give you a change&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, &quot;it&#39;s fair I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be turning you into an appliance when I invited you over dude you have to believe me.  But I know it&#39;s fair so what are you gonna do to me?&quot; You ask<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you know I&#39;m bi so fucking you over one way seems like a good plan maybe you should be a sex toy, hmmm or s plunger or s roll of TP course this whole mixed up change is also good and I want to enjoy things as much too soo there should be some animal aditions....&quot; He began fussing with the screen and the changes you made giggling as he did so.<br />
<br />
You watch worried about what your new form will be only to see him adjusting you to be hybridized with a clydesdale horse form, then you see him scrolling the inanimate listings before going into physical changes and extended formating changes.  He finishes up and then plugs your phone in downloads something to it and then to his own.  You take your phone back and then go up to the kitchen to make dinner while you do you poke at an app he installed on your phone and wonder what tomorrow brings.<br />
<br />
Jonas joins you and you have a great meal together before he changes back to a toilet again and hope into the living room.  You both watch tv until jonas nearly falls over being saved by you adjusting his form zombie base is now wider on your phone. When the gurgling bubbles get to be too much you wake him and you both head for bed.  Jonas hope into your bathroom and thanks to adjustments the co tractor made and jonas can now make for himself he clips himself in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember no funny business like this morning may?&quot; He asks<br />
<br />
You nod &quot;I promise I will just look the door for you&quot; jonas doesn&#39;t see your fingers crossed behind your back.  <br />
<br />
Morning comes round again and groggily you shamble to.tje bathroom needing to piss again and repeating yesterday morning all over.  Dammned contractor you think to yourself as you see the bubbles in the trap of the toilet and you adjust your boxers so you can piss comfortably.  Water splashes and this morning you remember before you flush.  Looking down you see jonas has looked up at you and you blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry bro nature rang I answered and you flushed.&quot; Your grab his handle and press down listening to water pour through him and a suprise moan as well....</p>
