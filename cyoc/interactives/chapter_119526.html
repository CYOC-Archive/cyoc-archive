<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on, Jeffy. Time is short and we have a lot to do, &quot; said Jenny as she guided him out of his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure..&quot; Jeff snapped back angrily. &quot;And time is not the only stuff that&#39;s short today...&quot; <br />
<br />
It really bothered him, this new size of his. Sure, there were more important changes like the 100% female vagina he now possessed. But he decided he&#39;d try to ignore that for as long as he only can. He felt the way his underwear was snug and flat against his crotch. Also with some movements he noticed he could actually feel two sides of a slick _opening_ rubbing against each other way down between his legs. Those feelings were disturbing, but much easier to ignore than his new size. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t sure how short Jenny had made him, but everything around him looked huge. That is when he got close. Whereas before he was able to touch the tops of door frames with no trouble, now they loomed high above his head. Jeff figured he might be able to brush his fingers against their tops if he jumped. Maybe.<br />
<br />
On their way to the main door they passed by a large mirror and Jeff couldn&#39;t get over what he saw. Two ridiculously dressed young women. One wearing boy&#39;s clothes, kinda too small for her. She was tall for a girl, probably at least 6&#39;3&#39;&#39;, but was well proportioned just like the normal-sized Jenny. There was a bulge clearly visible in her crotch (if one looked), but most people would probably dismiss it as a childish joke of stuffing ones underwear with socks. The girl was leading another one by the hand. That other girl was like the opposite of the first one. Her clothes were loose and baggy on her scrawny frame. She was short. If they stood together, with the shorter girl in the front, she would fit entirely below the larger ones breasts. Speaking of breasts, the smaller girl didn&#39;t seem to have pretty much any, beyond puffy nipples making two points on the front of her shirt. It was hard to tell her age, bacause while her body was so underdeveloped, her face had a hint of maturity suggesting an age on par with the larger girl. <br />
<br />
When they reached the main door another problem ensued. Shoes. None of Jeff&#39;s shoes fit Jenny large feet now and she had to resort to taking his dad&#39;s flip-flops. Jeff&#39;s feet on the other hand were simply too small for any of the adult shoes arranged neatly on the shoe rack. Which left only... <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this is perfect!&quot; Jenny squealed clasping her hands. <br />
<br />
In front of Jeff, there was three pairs of shoes. Shoes belonging to his 10 year old sister. And the worst part was they seemed like their size 3 would actually fit his tiny feet. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the choices he had. There was a pair of simple black flats, bright-pink sneakers and delicate summer sandals on one inch heel. He figured if it was this or going barefoot he could put up with a little pink in his life. He reached out for the sneakers but a large hand stopped his small one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffy...&quot; Jenny was smiling. &quot;Why don&#39;t you try the sandals? I think you&#39;d look cute!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at her not at all impressed. How could she still try to make me look &#39;cuter&#39;? <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fucking kidding me?&quot; he barked back, but in his high voice it did not sound at all as intimidating as he planned. &quot;No way I&#39;m wearing something that girly. And it has a heel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha I though you wanted to be taller!&quot; Jenny laughed before becoming weirdly serious. &quot;No, really, put them on.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; Jeff felt determined to not give in to his girlfriend&#39;s demands. This entire thing was going too far... <br />
<br />
He leaned to reach for the sneakers when suddenly he briefly felt dizzy. When he stood up with the sneakers in his hands something was wrong. Something felt different...<br />
<br />
His pectorals felt like they were aching in a weird way. He directed his confused gaze to Jenny. She was smiling. Hesitantly he looked down at his chest. Nothing seemed any different... <br />
<br />
&quot;Take a peak inside!&quot; he heard Jenny&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
He pulled away the neck of his blouse to reveal his underdeveloped breasts. It was still so weird seeing his nipples so puffed up, even though they really weren&#39;t big by normal breast standards. And now they were aching... <br />
<br />
But then as he looked closed he noticed something. Slowly, not fast enough to be super obvious but definitely noticeably, a tiny pillow of soft flesh appeared under each of his puffy nipple. He could see how, a fraction of an inch each second, the aureolae puffed up even more before simply being lifted on an increasing amount of tissue gathered underneath each one of them. <br />
<br />
Jeff was still definitely a red-blooded male inside and so he found his growing breasts absolutely mesmerising. So mesmerising that it was only a full minute before he realised that whereas his girlfriend had given him only barely a pair of puffy nipples, now they stuck out at least an inch further on what definitely were small breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Jeff directed his confused gaze to his huge girlfriend. &quot;Can you please stop this!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I can&#39;t.&quot; she responded still smiling calmly. &quot;But you can. Put the sandals on.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the sneakers in his hands and the sandals in hers. His chest still ached and kinda itched as well. He absent-mindedly scratched it only for his fingers to encounter way more flesh than he expected. It broke his hesitation. <br />
<br />
As he tied the dainty laces of the sandals around his feet he felt defeated but happy the annoying ache-itch in his chest was lessening. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; finally he looked up to Jenny. <br />
<br />
&quot;That? Oh, nothing...&quot; the smile returned to her face again. &quot;I might have made some other tweaks when changing you...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What tweaks?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ve just noticed one. If you don&#39;t do something I say your breasts will grow until you do. Simple.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff stayed silent trying to take in what he just heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also as they get bigger, the sexual appeal a female breast has to you as a male will get transferred to me. If you reach a B-cup, it should be roughly the point at which boobs hold no sexual appeal to you anymore, and I&#39;ll feel as attracted to them as you would earlier this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s crazy!&quot; Jeff wanted to scream. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. That&#39;s *interesting*. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what you saw in cleavage and you might learn how pointless carrying all that weight on our chests is for us.&quot; she smiled again. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s up to you if you let them grow or simply do what I say!&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that she opened the door and stepped through, pulling Jeff on his feet and outside. The door shut close and Jenny set off down the street in the direction of the mall, Jeff being barely able to follow her long strides. He frowned realising that unlike back in the house, he could now actually feel the two conical breasts bounce ever-so-slightly on his chest as he vigourusly tried to catch up with his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Jenny was in an excellent mood. She was really proud of her handiwork and was anxious to explore their changes. She couldn&#39;t wait to try out her new junk and she knew the new leverage of persuasion she held over Jeff would come in handy with that. Of course that would have to wait until they get dressed properly... That should also be fun. Looking down on Jeff she marvelled at how great being so much bigger made her feel. Maybe 24hours wasn&#39;t going to be enough... <br />
<br />
&quot;Cheer up Jeffy! Turn that frown upside down!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff was in no cheerful mood. He was NOT going to listen to his girlfriend. He walked sullen and quiet for another dozen or so steps before realising the ache-itch in his chest returned. <br />
<br />
&quot;God fucking dammit&quot; he murmured and a small forced smile appeared on his lips. The ache stopped.</p>
