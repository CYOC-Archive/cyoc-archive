<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If Bob were to deal the highest degree of damage to his traitor of a friend&#39;s family, he knew he&#39;d have to take over the youngest son&#39;s body. They&#39;d greatly underestimate him, and they would not expect the plans he had in mind. Bob stood from the bench and followed the guy. Luckily, he and his brother doesn&#39;t seem to go to the same school as they took off in the opposite direction. Bob followed closely, but not close enough for the boy to see him. As he walked, he took note of the boy&#39;s appearance. The guy has thick shaggy hair arranged in random swirls, a hairstyle Danny used to have during his first few years in the drug trade. He wore a thick hoodie and baggy pants, which is apt because of how cold today&#39;s morning is. And Bob thought that he should have bought clothes for the weather. But no matter, that is useless since he&#39;ll ditch his body in a few minutes. <br />
<br />
The boy stopped at a road crossing which also served as a bus stop. The place is familiar to Bob as this is where he usually waited for his public ride to other states. The timer is a few minutes away, so the boy and Bob took a seat on a bench. Bob didn&#39;t waste a single second when he touched the boy by his neck and initiated the swap. This would be Bob&#39;s twentieth use of the ring, and little did he know, a new set of power would be presented to him by a sort of innate knowledge placed on his mind. Imagine this knowledge like breathing. It&#39;s natural. It&#39;s an idea that doesn&#39;t need to be taught. This is how it felt like. <br />
<br />
The world swirled upside down for the boy, but Bob was used to it. He awoke to new perspectives, albeit a shorter one than his previous one. Using the knowledge given to him by the ring, he grabbed his old body&#39;s chin and told him to open his eyes. He placed the ring right in front of his face, and the ring shone gold. It&#39;s not quite hypnotism. The ring will instill an idea in the boy&#39;s mind, an idea that would tell him to accept the swap and that there is nothing he could do. In time, the boy will grow used to his new body, and soon, he will even forget his original identity. <br />
<br />
While the confusion is fresh, Bob used it to ask the boy some questions. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is my name?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke Turner,&quot; The boy said with his new gruff voice. Bob was not surprised to hear that his surname is not Gomez. His asshole of a friend must have changed it to Turner so he could be far away from his old life. Can&#39;t blame him. He accrued a handful of enemies during his old days, including Bob. Such a shame that he didn&#39;t even bother tying all threads that would lead to him. He looked at Luke and saw him bob his head to the side - it&#39;s a mannerism Bob has when he is about to ask a question. &quot;And my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is not important. You can have any name you&#39;d like.&quot; Bob snatched all the money from his pocket but left him a couple grand.  &quot;Take the next bus and go far away from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke massaged his temples as he managed to say a trailing, &quot;Okay&quot;. Sure enough, Luke enterred the next bus that came over. Bob knows the route and it leads a few states over. Within minutes of waiting, the bus disappeared, and Luke along with it. Hopefully, he takes Bob&#39;s orders to heart and never to return again. With that said and done, onto more pressing problem. Swapping bodies does not give Bob the privilege of peering inside his new body&#39;s memories. He didn&#39;t have to do it with the prior bodies he swapped with, but he needs it now more than ever if he is to assume Luke&#39;s identity for a long duration. Bob pulled a tablet from his backpack which conveniently unlocked upon scanning his face. Technology sure had come far during the years he stayed in prison. Inside the laptop was his schedule for the day, which thankfully was only a single subject that lasted until 10 am. There&#39;s also a diary application but unlike before, he needs a password to unlock it. Bob doesn&#39;t know what to input in the password field, so he left it for another time.<br />
<br />
Bob&#39;s knew school is a place he recognized, but has not seen in actuality. He used to dream at getting enrolled in this school, back when his life is still innocent and butterflies. But there&#39;s not much you can do when your mother just died and your new foster family is cheapskates who only adopted you for the welfare money. In time, Bob forgot his dream - until now. It&#39;s not much of a prestigious school but it&#39;s well known in the city. Bob stared in awe because of how large the buildings are, and probably the abundance of statues that depicted the bull mascot of the school. <br />
<br />
Bob&#39;s first subject is Mathematics, which seemed easy enough. You&#39;ve got to be proficient with numbers when you&#39;re selling drugs. And Danny would often leave him with accounting work when the days are slow. There was a test, which Bob finished quickly from the rest of the class. Passing early rose a few brows, including his old crone of a teacher. It seems Bob should have slowed down a bit if he was to get this degree of attention. Luckily enough, his teacher isn&#39;t paid enough to be suspicious of cheating students. She took the paper and told Bob to leave. <br />
<br />
Bob returned to his new home a bit earlier than usual. His mother, whom he is starting to recognize, was a bit shocked about his early return. She didn&#39;t stay too long at the thought and returned to her household duties. Just as Bob was about to turn to his bedroom, he saw a familiar glasses sitting on the table. It&#39;s the very same glasses that bitch who clung to Daniel used to have. It&#39;s Therese. And holy fuck! The years have been kind to her. That bitch is a whore known for her roleplays. Depending on the price, she can be your mother, sister, or daughter. It&#39;s such a shame Bob never got to deal with her services. But given his current situation, it&#39;s not too late for that. And boy, did he remember her being quite a frail thin figure. As of now, she&#39;s got one thick ass that grew even fatter whenever she turned over to pick up clothes inside the washing machine. And quite frankly, Bob is getting turned on just seeing that ass. <br />
<br />
Bob shook that thought and left for the bedroom. In doing so, he passed over Daniel - his new father. Unlike his wife, time fucked him sideways. Most of his thick hair is gone. The ones that were left remained just above his ears, leaving the rest a barren shiny wasteland. There&#39;s bags on his eyes, and flabs of fat clung to his arms. His stomach is a dome of air and fat. He&#39;s a husk of the man he used to be, but that doesn&#39;t mean he is privy to Bob&#39;s mercy. Thing&#39;s aren&#39;t square unless he ruined his family. <br />
<br />
Bob entered his bedroom. Although it looked nothing out of the ordinary, it is miles better than his quarters in prison. He&#39;s got a bed that he doesn&#39;t have to share with a half-naked person who stabbed his boss. The place is messy, but not as suffocating like his concrete prison. He could sleep anytime he wanted, he could do anything he wants. He&#39;s free. And in his enjoyment, Bob saw his reflection in the mirror. This face, this clean and lively innocent face is now his. His eyes, dark green with soft edges, spoke innocence and inexperience. And for those who would assume innocence from him because of his appearance, pity them. Bob undressed his clothes to acquaint himself with body he now has. <br />
<br />
Bob&#39;s new body is devoid of scars and hints of bruises. These limbs has seen no hardships nor violence. Which is quite a pity because it means it doesn&#39;t have any muscles. He only has baby fat, and most have accrued at his pudgy belly. He squeezed his stomach which made an inch thick flab. While looking below, Bob caught a glimpse of his member, uncut and years away from its peak growth. It&#39;s still a bit hard because of his mother, but it&#39;s slowly shrinking back to an even smaller dick with extra crumpled foreskin at the tip. <br />
<br />
Bob looked once more in the mirror. There&#39;s a strange in the reflection, which seemed oddly alien at the start. But as seconds pass, he grew acquainted at the sight. Ever movement he made, the reflection followed. He made a sick smile the reached from ear to ear, and the reflection smiled its grimace back at him. When made quick strides from left to right, he saw his dick wag in the same direction, he could feel the cold air lick his balls and travel at the niche of his spine. Sweat pored out of his temple as he quickly grew tired from the simple exercise. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not Bob anymore,&quot; Bob said with his higher-pitchedd voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Luke,&quot; Bob wiped the sweat from his brow and looked straight at his reflection. &quot;I&#39;m Luke Turner. I&#39;m fucking Luke Turner, and I&#39;m going to ruin this family,&quot;</p>
