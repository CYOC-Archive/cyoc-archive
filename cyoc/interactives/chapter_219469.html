<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The tattoo parlor looked like a dive bar inside of a garbage dump. With smoke emanating from an adjoining room; Maisy gets the impression that this parlor provides more than just tattoos. A large male comes out of the smoke filled room. With the head of a bull and the legs of a chicken, both Maisy and Rachael smile as he beckons them inside. Getting closer to the bull demon, Rachael notices that he has a prominent belly bump. Noticing that his package is missing and in its place is a vagina; Rachael concluded that this man is expecting and his partner is also male.<br />
<br />
“How far along are you,” Rachael making pleasant conversation. Seeing artwork all along the wall, noticing the roses, skulls and daggers in some of the pictures.<br />
“First trimester,” the male responds offering the two female demons a seat on the couch.<br />
“You drew all these,” Maisy looking that the art work.<br />
“Yes,” the pregnant male replying; “most of them are when I was human.”<br />
“Oh,” Rachael chiming in; “how long have you been a demon?”<br />
“Going on 80 years now,” the male putting away some sketches; “my partner rescued me after taking a shine to my artwork.”<br />
“What did he rescue you from,” Maisy looking at a pinup of a scantily clad waitress in a 1940’s style uniform; “bad taste?”<br />
“Droll,” the man rolling his eyes as he drops a book onto to table; “He saved me from a death sentence I would had if I was still in Pearl Harbor back in 41. All these images is a style I learned from a legendary Tattoo artist. Either one of you heard of Sailor Jerry?”<br />
Neither Maisy nor Rachael recognized the name.<br />
“He was a famous tattoo artist that put the American Traditional style of tattooing on the map,” the male demon stating; “I studied under him for a few years.”<br />
<br />
Rachael opening the book and is impressed at what she sees. Artwork of a more demonic approach. Instead of Roses, guns, Daggers and other items in thick solid lines; Rachael noticed pictures of snakes, dragons, large tentacle beings she could not identify. What surprised her was that these tattoos were moving across the pages. Some attacking each other, a few others in a state of carnal bliss. Page after page of different creatures in poses and positions that would make any sane man go insane.<br />
“This is the style I draw now,” the pregnant demon showing pride; “tattoos that have a life of their own.&quot;<br />
“It’s all in the ink,” another male entering the room. Carrying a water pipe as he takes a hit of what is clearly filling the room up with smoke. “Would either lady like a toke?”<br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
“Ouch,” Maisy flinching as she squirms on the chair; opting to get a tattoo of a three headed hydra on her right arm. It was her first time getting inked and it hurt like hell. But what surprised Maisy was how calm Rachael was; choosing a tattoo of an angry gorgon preparing to strike on her left arm. The needles from the tattoo guns made a constant buzzing sound as the ink was being punched into their skins. Every few minutes the guns would go silent as both tattoo artists either changed the needle to do a different part or the tattoo or using different color of ink to fill in the voids or to add the required shading.<br />
“Almost done,” the pregnant bull demon commenting as he worked on Rachael; “you have been rather calm compared to your friend.” The artist pausing briefly, as he heard Maisy wince in discomfort again.<br />
<br />
“The more you squirm,” the other artist stating; “the longer this will take.<br />
“It fucking hurts,” Maisy gritting her teeth; “This was your Ideal Rachael.” Maisy regretting this decision yet could not deny that the tattoo does look amazing. It was only a few more minutes before both tattoo artists finished with their latest canvasses. Stepping back they watch as the tattoos began coming to life thanks to the ink and begin moving about. Rachael beamed as her Gorgon slithered around her arm; going so far to travel to her other arm before heading back to where it was originally drawn.<br />
“Fucking awesome,” Rachael flexing her arm; “How is your Maisy?”<br />
“Spitting fire as travels up my arm,” Maisy watching the beast on her skin.<br />
“Hold hands,” the pregnant bull man admiring the pieces.<br />
<br />
Both Maisy and Rachael hold hands and watch the tattoos approach each other and the switch spots. Maisy’s Hydra now of Racheal as Rachael’s Gorgon travels all over Maisy before heading back.<br />
“Okay,” Maisy nodding; “Worth the torturous prick of those mechanized pins.”<br />
“So who do we charge our services to,” the other artist speaking up; his arm wrapped around the pregnant bull demon in a loving embrace with his hand lovingly rubbing the obvious baby bump.<br />
“Charge it to the account of Lady Miasma Morningstar,” Maisy using her court name; “Archdiablesse to the ninth circle.”<br />
“My lady,” The demon looking shocked; “we had no ideal.”<br />
“You think my mother and your aunt would be down to get ink here,” Rachael looking at Maisy.<br />
“We can always ask them,” as Maisy signs a receipt accepting the charges made to her account. “Do you want to head back home, or are you still looking at doing some else spontaneous?”<br />
“Spontaneity implies a spur of the moment decision,” Rachael answering; “Perhaps a bite to eat. Do you know any place worth checking out?”<br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
The Drunken Dragon Bar and Grill was the place to get a decent bite to eat as well as quick tumble with a waiter or waitress if that was what you desired. Right now, Rachael and Maisy decided a lovely meal was in order. Walking in; the two naked demons each with a living tattoo and fresh piercings were greeted by a toad faced maître dee.<br />
“Welcome to the Drunken Dragon the demon croaking as he finished speaking ; “do you wish to have a private room or prefer to common dining area?<br />
“Dining area is fine,” Maisy answering; “and we’ll start with a bottle of spiced wined;” Maisy speaking as they were lead to a table for two near the hallway to the private rooms; “preferably from the Napoleonic era.” <br />
“Of course,” the demon nodding; “do you need menus or do you know what you are ordering?”<br />
“Menus please,” Maisy answered; “But we will start with an appetizer of fresh pickled hemlock.”<br />
“Hemlock,” Rachael looking shocked; “isn’t that poisonous?”<br />
“Not for demons,” Maisy looking at the menu and mulling; “Auroch burgers look appetizing. And pickled hemlock has a tangy taste that moves to the savory end of the palette. But if you smoke it,” Maisy looking at Rachael; “it will knock you out and give you a buzz that pales compared to marijuana.”<br />
“You tried,” Rachael sounding interested at trying something else that her father would disapprove of.<br />
“Only once,” Maisy putting down the menu; “but it was an amazing high. I know what I want.” Maisy pausing as she observes the waitress put down two plates of pickles hemlock leaves. The maître dee arriving with the requested bottle of wine and pouring two glasses as Rachael samples the pickled hemlock.<br />
<br />
“How is it,” Maisy sipping the wine; as she watches Rachael take another hemlock leaf.<br />
“It’s not bad,” Rachael trying the wine; “it tastes like kale.”<br />
“Different for everyone,” Maisy popping a few in her mouth; “they remind me of the seaweed wrap on that sushi we tried a few weeks ago.”<br />
“That gas station sushi was a mistake both of us regret;” Rachael shuddering at that metal image of both experiencing a bad case of the runs while taking their college exams. “I’ll think I’ll have the Auroch burger,” Rachael putting down the menu.<br />
“Two Auroch burgers,” Maisy handing the menus to the waiter; “both medium well.”<br />
“Rare for me,” Rachael adding; “with the parsnip fries.”<br />
“Excellent choice,” The waiter nodding as he quickly writes down the order before leaving.<br />
“What is Auroch,” Rachael asking as she takes another sip of the spiced wine.<br />
“An ancient cow that went extinct on earth,” Maisy popping another hemlock leaf; “but the variant here in hell has managed to thrive. Some of the meat you were wolfing down during breakfast was Auroch,” Maisy smiling; “You were clearly hungry.”<br />
“I did pack away several helpings,” Rachael recalling the plates of eggs and assorted meats she filled up on. “I guess becoming a demon and nearly dying from a blessed blade gave me the appetite of a black hole.”<br />
Maisy laughed as they continued to make small talk while waiting for their food.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************************<br />
<br />
It was when their food arrived that Rachael’s mother now called Atargatis and her lover Astaroth show up and wave to the two. The maître dee quickly pairing the two parties, by adding a second table making it a party of four. Both notice the tattoos that Rachael and Maisy are sporting; staring stunned as the tattoos move and contort about all over their bodies.<br />
“What did you do,” Rachael’s mother the first to speak; “failing to notice the ear and nose peircings on Rachael.<br />
“Letting loose some repressed urges and emotions,” Rachael responding to her mother; “And I thought the best way was to get the things father forbid to do. Get some piercings and a tattoo.”<br />
Atargatis, then noticed the blue opal ear and nose studs and then understood Rachael reasoning.<br />
“Remember what father said;” as Rachael ate a parsnip fry; “Only harlots and whores get tattoos and wear piercings.”<br />
“So you figured to embrace some repressed urge to scream no more,” Rachael’s mother sampling the wine and nodding in approval.<br />
“More like a cannon ball in the deep end of the swimming pool,” Rachael biting into her burger; “and it looks like you took the plunge as well.”<br />
<br />
Atargatis couldn’t argue; deciding that the first order of business was to get a haircut the her former husband would freak out over. A pixie cut and dying her hair neon green. The color clashing with her red scales. Accentuating the new hair was an obsidian bracelet with jade gemstones on her left wrist and a jade anklet covering her right ankle. Atargatis also sported gold caps at the ends of her horns and was sporting black lipstick and mascara.<br />
“We found a beauty salon and your mother went all out,” Astaroth adding; “even got her nails and claws done.”<br />
<br />
Both began to give each other a brief rundown of their mornings so far. Rachael describing the store she went to where she acquired several revealing braziers who’s only purpose was to support the girls, while leaving their assets on full display. Mentioning the hedonistic display that several demon were inflicting on a human slave; Atargatis chuckled as she began to describe her morning highlights.<br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you castrated a pedophile,” Rachael nearly choking on her wine; “Why would you do that?”<br />
“Because he was one of the Iron Knights that got killed by both the angelic and demon raids,&quot; Rachael’s mother answering flatly; “You remember Steve from your high school prom?”<br />
“The school quarterback who raped me?” Rachael’s grip on the wine glass getting stronger and causing it to break; watching as her hand starts to bleed dark ichor from the several cuts of glass before grabbing a napkin to wrap her wound. Rachael remembering the mindless meathead; “what of him? Is he down here?”<br />
“He was the pedophile I was referring to,” Atargatis eating a salad comprising of ice lichen and fire mushrooms; “Your father’s church covered up his misdeeds because they would cause a scandal if they came to light,” Rachael’s mother looking sad. “Despite the fact that he violated you; your father belived it was deserved for dressing provocative.”<br />
“A dress that went out of fashion in the 1950’s was considered provocative in his eyes,” Rachael fumed; “That bastard took away my virginity and beaten me black and blue and father did nothing to that shit head!&quot;<br />
Maisy and Astaroth looking shocked at the rage coming from the new demon; “and he is down here for his sins?” Rachael getting up; “Where is he. I want to pay him visit;” Rachael eyes glowing with rage at the chance to get some payback on another injustice inflicted upon her thanks to her father’s cruel indifference to her safety and well being.</p>
