<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was after the dinner when Camille said:<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don't understand why everyone has so much prejudice because the skunk stink. A zombie can fester around and no one complains. I see that before. How could a skunk stink be bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rosie looked her: &quot;you can't believe how powerful a skunk stink jet could be. A direct hit could make you Fell Down automatically. It's like that Tumblerpott rabbit said: it's like a weapon. Well, it's a weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure? Well, I can't believe that it is that gross. I want to see this.&quot; said Camille defiantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure, Camille?&quot; said Don &quot;Remember: you can lose this clothes, as skunk stink impregnates everything it touches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think it will not Mega Fall Down me, so I think there's no real risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I'll engage the stink protection.&quot; said Stripey, activating some levers and controls &quot;Flappy, Hunny and Don, put the gasmasks on. For some safeness, I'll only release Rosie's knot. Everyone's okay?&quot; all nodded.<br />
<br />
Flappy taken and given the gasmasks for all, except Camille and the skunks. Rosie let Stripey unknot her tail. The little green smoke shown, and Rosie turned her back to Camille, her tail pointed directly to Camille's face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... 3... 2... 1... shoot!&quot; said Rosie, expelling what looked a sickly green liquid directly on Camille's face.<br />
<br />
The reaction was instantaneous: Camile turned into a rotten brown hue and withered like she had been put on fire, his face with what looked utterly disgust, dismaying like in that old Woody Woodpecker show  when a sailor Buzz Buzzard kissed someone. <br />
<br />
&quot;She Fell Down! Incredible.&quot; said Don, while Flappy activated some exhaustors and Stripey knotted Rosie's tail again. After that, Hunny used some AirFresh to return the room for the original situation. Don putted Camille withered body on the sofa. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go to our room and take her necessaire and a new costume for her use after she recovers. Take care of her. I'll be back soon, Camille darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Don.&quot; said weakly Camille After he went, Camille said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ, that guy was right: it's a weapon. It was so overwhelming that my brain looked it would shut downs itself any moment. I can't describe the smell, but I'm nurse and had taken some necrosis cases, and it was worse than them. Real worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had been warned.&quot; said Hunny wisely, removing his gasmask &quot;It's a really powerful natural weapon. Even tigers and lions runs away when a skunk turns its back against them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, anyway, I still think it's barbarian all these anti-skunk policies. It's a unreasonable prejudice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Camille.&quot; said Rosie &quot;Prejudice maybe, but not unreasonable. That stink I shot on your face exude continually if I don't knot my tail. It would not be so overwhelming because in your case I shoot it directly on you. Normally the stink would flew around and being a little weaker, although affecting more people. I can very well see how much this could be bad.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you accept this?&quot; said Camille<br />
<br />
&quot;It just because I know I accept.&quot; said Rosie &quot;I was a attorney on 'real world' before accept perm myself as Rosie. And I learnt on the Court that 99% percent of the real life problems would be solved if people accept some quid-pro-cod. This is the reason as I don't complain about these policies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you're sure. Well at least I could say back home I Feel Down by a skunk stink shoot.&quot; Camille said giggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You Fell Down by a skunk shoot and still can see good thing on this... Now I can see why you're good on Illogic Logic.&quot; said Stripey.<br />
<br />
Camille just POOFed back to his good form, recovering herself from the Fall Down, as healthy as before being hit by the stink shot. Her clothes, however, still stank like rotten eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your husband Don had gone taken you some clean clothes.&quot; said Stripey. &quot;Tell you what: you and Rosie goes to the bathroom. You take a good bath to remove all residual stink and, when Don arrive, I take your clothes and passes it to you through Rosie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; said Camille. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't you go, Stripey?&quot; said Rosie. &quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rosie, you're the 'she' here now.&quot; said Stripey, pulling them to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
As Camille undressed herself, Rosie looked her:<br />
<br />
&quot;You're really pretty. No fat at all.&quot; said Rosie, as she prepared the bath, mixing the bath scents.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm three times amateur Jeetkunedo champion. Also I practice fencing and bow-and-arrow. My family had some tradition in medieval fairs. My dad was a bard, mom was a fortuneteller. Me? I liked to play the tomboy princess.&quot; She said, giggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad had the same type of hobby, but it's a pageantry fan. He liked to replay some of the Civil War battles. By myself, that was subdued by the Scouts.&quot; Rosie said, mixing the bath salts.<br />
<br />
When Camille entered the bath, she relaxed immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Lord! It's incredible. The scents are perfect. Chamomile and blueberry... Tell me, you're not uncomfortable with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because I'm a skunk and I stink normally, that's not reason I couldn't like good smells.&quot; said Rosie, mocking indignantly. Then she giggle and said. &quot;It was like Fox said: skunks has almost perfect smell sense. We like scents in general. Humans, either normal and toon, has better vision that other senses. Not that skunks are blind or anything - skunks has a vision as good as human - , but what vision is for humans, smell is for skunks: the way we can learn better the world. A skunk with no smell sense could be compared to a blind guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand. Maybe, next time we came into ToonWorld I could convince Don to try skunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure he would like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say me... How you had learn all this much about being a skunk. If I understood, it was less than 12 hours you're a female skunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Less than 8 hours: originally I should be a female bunny, not skunk. But I think this came as an instinct, giving more value to the smell than to the vision, and learning to discriminate the types of smelling. I'm learning still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Camille, I taken some clothes and also taken a special bag for you put your skunked clothes for laundry.&quot; Said Don, through the door &quot;Also taken your necessaire with shampoo and soap and everything&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, darling.&quot; said Camille &quot;Pass through the door. Rosie will catch it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me and guys'll play some poker on living room. We had bought some snacks also. You and Rosie could join after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; said Camille, seeing the Alice in Wonderland costume in Rosie's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Don looks like a cartoon nuts.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say me. He have all Waltz Lantz and Hanna Barbera shows in DVD and BluRay in home and view at least two hours of cartoon every weekend. He even had taken some autographs from guys like Buzz Buzzard and Chilly Willy and Wally Walrus and Daffy Duck and Top Cat and Speedy Gonzales. But... I need to say... I'm really glad about ToonWorld. He's a air traffic controller. It's a very stressful job, and some guys on there turns to booze or Valis or weed or game addiction. Here Don can have his time to go bonkers and &quot;de-pressurizing&quot; so to speak with some &quot;safety&quot;, just skipping things that could Mega Fall Down, in fact, kill him. His first Fall Down was like Flappy: jumping into a turbojet engine.&quot; Said Camille. &quot;And about you and Stripey? I know you was a guy and he was your wife and so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was attorney and she was a obstetrician. I think Don case is like Stripey's: he, then she, lost so much nights helping mothers giving birth... He was halfway to go amok. You had to put there a extra factor: he... She, in time... was sterile, so her job gave her a little frustration. He never complained, but I know 100% she.. He, in fact... Wanted kids. We weren't eligible for adoption, as we have jobs that implied 100% time dedication, little time saving for kids. Well, maybe I can give him little skunks in future, so he could exert his maternal... Now paternal... Instincts. I ever wanted to be a daddy, why not be a mommy? &quot; They giggled &quot;And you? You don't look exactly a cartoon nut like Don, but these costumes... First Dorothy, now Alice in Wonderland...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm pediatric nurse. So in work we read some story books or shows DVDs to children every now and then. So, it was natural for me identifying myself with, for example, Alice, Dorothy and Strawberry Shortcake. Some of these costumes I use on my work. So Don said this would be good for a ToonWorld luggage.&quot; said Camille. Rosie packed the Dorothy costume on the pack, which looked uncomfortably like a body pack, when Camille looked to the Rosie's knotted tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask you about your tail? It hurts, that knot?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this?&quot; said Rosie, embracing her tail on the height of the knot, blushing a little &quot;Well, the knot don't hurt. I could compare with using a tight bra: uncomfortable, but not hurtful. But... We skunks feel the touch on our tails sensual, very sensual. I could compare it like you having someone touching your breasts. That was the reason I and Stripey didn't liked when Giggles had knotted our tails on FDT. That wasn't the Giggle skill. It was a little intrusive. But we understood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying Giggles was, like, harassing you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not harassing... Giggles was doing his job. It was not like he was taken advantage from this. But it was uncomfortable still...&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
Camille finished her bath and putted her Alice costume, complete with pinafore and a big lace over her hair. Rosie choosed one of Camile's perfumes, with wild rose and evergren, and sprayed Camile &quot;just enough to be hot&quot;.<br />
<br />
They came out the bathroom and Don eyes goes out his eyesockets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Camille, you're real hot!&quot; said Don. Camille pirouetted to show his bloomers and thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, darling.&quot; said Camille, with a so prim curtsy that everyone whistle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, those's her skunked clothes.&quot; said Rosie, putting them through the trapdoor. &quot;I read they'll be cleaned and sent back to you. This is not SDP, after all. Well, Camille, do you want play poker with the guys or see  NASCAR? I'm a woman now, but I still like racing.&quot;</p>
