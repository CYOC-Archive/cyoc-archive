<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy opens the door to see a hulking man standing at the doorstep. Before Tommy can say anything the man pushes past him into the house and begins muttering about some crazy revelation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey little dude, love the costume,&quot; the man chuckles. &quot;Look today has been absolutely incredible and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this but I need to switch things back already. While it&#39;s been so cool having this incredible body and for people to have to look up to me for a change, it&#39;s also changed things in my life I didn&#39;t expect. <br />
<br />
Like when I got home from school my mom said I couldn&#39;t sleepover at my best friend&#39;s house which I&#39;ve done every year on Halloween since we were 5 because it wasn&#39;t appropriate given my size. Then she said I had all these new chores to do around the house and that I couldn&#39;t even go trick or treating. <br />
<br />
So I took plenty of selfies, had some fun and knew the only thing left was to give you back what I stole so I could get back to enjoying life as a normal kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man paused. Tommy stood there unsure of who he was or what exactly he was going on about. He was so confused he failed to speak up before the man began talking again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, didn&#39;t expect you to be speechless. Look, my mom is waiting outside so I&#39;m not going to waste any time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man suddenly took off his shirt, pants and shoes. <br />
<br />
Tommy looked on in awe. He had never seen someone this muscular in real life, only in the movies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Since I stole these from you earlier it&#39;s only right I give them back too,&quot; the man said handing Tommy the clothes. &quot;Alright, here goes nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man closed his eyes and made a weird face. <br />
<br />
John&#39;s POV:<br />
<br />
Suddenly, John felt as though his whole body was shrinking. His mighty biceps felt as though they were deflating as did his shoulders, pecs, abs, thighs, and yes, even his crotch. It felt like the world around him was growing while the reality was he was shrinking back into his thin frame the muscles and the strength they gave him draining quickly.<br />
<br />
In mere moments, he went from being a 6&#39;5 foot Adonis back to a weak little boy.<br />
<br />
He frowned looking at his figure and was cringed the moment he heard his girlish voice again as he said, &quot;Well, that was fun while it lasted. See on Monday.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tommy&#39;s POV:<br />
<br />
Tommy looked on in shock as the man before him suddenly began to shrink before his eyes. Within seconds, the man went from a greek god to a small boy who now stood eye to eye with Tommy. <br />
<br />
Before Tommy could even react, the boy ran out the door in nothing but his underwear. What Tommy didn&#39;t realize was that that was just the beginning. <br />
<br />
Tommt felt a tingling sensation in his calves. He planted his feet firmly, and his calves began to grow. Slowly but surely, inch by inch. He moaned as his thick, defined muscle piled itself onto his lower legs. The muscle now protruded out the back of his legs massively.<br />
<br />
The growth next moved up his legs to his quadriceps. The already defined muscle began to expand, layers and layers of hard muscle piling on.<br />
<br />
He felt a tingle in his upper stomach as a line appeared down his stomach. At the top, just below his chest, two cinder blocks emerged from his stomach. Another row emerged below it, and another, and another. He stared in awe at his 8 pack abs .<br />
<br />
His small pecs began to expand, bigger and bigger. He laughed as his back widened. His traps expanding, and his neck thickening greatly.<br />
<br />
His hands started to grow, becoming heavier. The growth moved up his forearms as they swelled. He gasped as his biceps and triceps expanded as well, nearing 20&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hair sprung up on his chest, and a treasure trail down his abdomen. His face transformed to that of a charming, steely man with his stubble growing in on his cut jawline.<br />
<br />
Finally the transformation stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Tommy, I finally found some safety pins which should....&quot; Brian stopped mid-sentence as a wave of shock and confusion came over him. <br />
<br />
As he came down the stairs, Brian was shocked to see a mountain of a man standing there in nothing but a Batman mask and Batman underoos. It couldn&#39;t be, Brian thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;John, is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man turned around. Those were definitely Brian&#39;s well chiseled muscles but something seemed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey Brian.&quot; the man answered back, his voice deep and gravelly but somewhat unsure.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, I&#39;m so glad you came around as I can&#39;t take another minute of living in this small body. Can you do the thing and give me my muscles back already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, sorry little buddy but I can&#39;t,&quot; the man answered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean you can&#39;t, you text me and said you were coming to make things right and turn me back,&quot;<br />
<br />
The man reached up and pulled off the mask revealing a face familiar, yet not that matching John&#39;s. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t dude, because I&#39;m not John.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man nodded as Brian&#39;s stomach sank.</p>
