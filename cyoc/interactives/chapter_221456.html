<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We have a problem, Trey.&quot; Vic said as he came out from the back of the apartment, empty plate in hand.<br />
<br />
Trey was back in the kitchen chopping up vegetables, wearing only a pair of shorts, he only seemed to willingly wear clothes while cooking. Looking up at Vic he grinned. &quot;I&#39;d say, you just ate a whole ribeye and four eggs, I&#39;m going to need to go shopping again. I forgot how much we can eat going through this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean.&quot; Vic replied, setting down the plate and bringing up his hands to rub at his face. The sound of ripping fabric brought his attention back down to his shirt, where the seam on one of his sleeves hade torn open, which he fingered with an annoyed frown.<br />
<br />
Trey chuckled softly to himself. Softly for a deep rumble, anyway. &quot;That shirt has more problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic sighed and dropped his arms. &quot;I&#39;m trying to be serious, here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey frowned and set down the knife, putting his hands on the counter, he leaned in towards Vic. &quot;Sorry, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trish, the friend I was out at the bar with the night we met? She wants to meet up. One of her friends saw us leave together and she wants to meet my new boyfriend.&quot; Vic walked over to the sofa and flopped down, letting his head hand back as he stared up at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can either avoid her. Make plans and cancel last minute to put her off. Or we vanish.&quot; Trey said, laying out the options as his gaze lingered on Vic. He could feel those eyes on him, even as he stared upwards. &quot;I have a place not far away we can head to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do that to her, Trey.&quot; Vic said, knowing he sounded whiney about it but not really caring. &quot;She&#39;s been my best friend for almost as long as I can remember. She was there for me ever since my father...&quot; Vic cut off, then looked right over at Trey who was now very studiously examining the floor and refusing to meet Vic&#39;s eyes. &quot;Ever since he left. Oh shit.&quot; Vic did some math in his head. &quot;He&#39;d have been thirty. You mean he&#39;s..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably.&quot; Trey replied. &quot;You had to get it from somewhere.&quot; Trey strode over and sat down on the chair facing Vic on the sofa, seeming to want to put some distance between them at the moment. &quot;It&#39;s not an uncommon story among us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; Vic asked, sympathy in his tone, which made Trey smile a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, both my parents are probably where I left them, I try not to think about my life before, it&#39;s easier. But, not everyone awakens, it doesn&#39;t always pass down, or sometimes it skips a few generations. Honestly, you&#39;re lucky if the worse you&#39;re abandoning is a best friend.&quot; Trey fixed a smile on his face, but to Vic it seemed incredibly forced. There was more there, but Vic didn&#39;t want to rip open Trey&#39;s wounds. &quot;The luckiest of us are born to those who have already changed so their parent can keep an eye on them, find someone to guide them through this when it&#39;s time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic slid to the side, laying prone on the couch as he processed all of this. Trey took one of his hands, holding it between his two large mitts. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Vic. This is why I&#39;m trying to ease you into this. It&#39;s a lot, and not all of it is fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we?&quot; Vic asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey was silent for a long moment, holding Vic&#39;s hand in his before he finally spoke up again. &quot;It&#39;s best if we wait until after all this to decide what we are.&quot; Vic felt lips pressing to his hand and looked over to Trey, who despite still looking a little morose, was sporting a small smile. &quot;In the mean time, I&#39;m happy to share your company in whatever way makes you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic accepted the answer with a nod. &quot;What am I going to do about Trish, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If she knows you as well as you say, there&#39;s no hiding any of this. So you just have to keep away. It&#39;s dangerous letting our secret out and it never ends well.&quot; Trey said, sounding like he was trying to be more diplomatic about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t understand her though, she&#39;s not going to take no for an answer, and she has a key. She might just show up if I put her off too long.&quot; Vic said as he rolled on to his side to keep his attention on Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we might want to head out to the cabin. If you don&#39;t want to cut ties suddenly, well, tell her we decided to take a little vacation. I think a clean break is better though, you&#39;re just putting off the inevitable.&quot; Releasing Vic&#39;s hand, Trey stood back up probably intending to head back into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Vic sat up, the change in position causing another button on his shirt to pop free and bounce across the wooden floor. &quot;God damn it!&quot; Vic yelled, grabbing the shirt and tearing the front open, scattering the remaining buttons. The anger fled as quickly as it reared up, and he sagged forward. &quot;This isn&#39;t fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic felt the sofa sink next to him, then a hand slipping under his shirt to rub as his side. &quot;No, it isn&#39;t. But we can make something of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Like run off together, get married, open a bed and breakfast where you can cook and I can run the business?&quot; Vic joked, some of his good humor coming back now that he was next to Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little cliche, but if that&#39;s what you want I&#39;m up for it.&quot; Trey replied, his hand still stroking Vic under his shirt. &quot;Hey. You&#39;ve got fuzz.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Vic lifted his undershirt enough to expose his chest a stomach, sure enough there was a faint patch of short brown hairs in the middle of his chest connected to a strip down his stomach which vanished below the waistband of his underwear. &quot;Damn.&quot; Vic remembered back to high school, being jealous of the other guys in the locker room looking so manly and grown up while he didn&#39;t. He finished peeling off the shirt along with the shredded remains of his button up and tossed them aside, then ran his fingers across the fine hairs. &quot;I kind of like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey just laughed and rubbed his own furry pecs. &quot;Well, more&#39;s coming. And wait until you can have a nice furry bear pelt, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
On a whim, Vic crawled onto Trey&#39;s lap, wrapping his arms around the bigger man&#39;s neck as he pressed their chests together. &quot;When do I get to see your furry bear pelt for real?&quot; He blushed as little as he realized he could feel Trey&#39;s erection pressed up against his own with just a few layers of flimsy fabric between.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon, I promise.&quot; Trey said as he pulled in Vic for a quick kiss, his hand going down to push the fabric out of the way, and taking both their cocks in his hand, his with a little more difficulty than Vic&#39;s. &quot;Aren&#39;t you still on the clock though?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic turned a shade of pale crimson, but leaned in closer to rest his head on Trey&#39;s shoulder as he stroked their cocks together. &quot;I&#39;m on lunch break, they won&#39;t miss me for another fifteen minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think you can make it thirty?&quot; Trey teased as he moved his hands under Vic&#39;s thighs, then stood up, lifting up the smaller man in the process.<br />
<br />
Vic let out a little yelp and tightened his hold around Trey&#39;s neck, though the bigger man was easily able to hold Vic up and against him as he started a lumbering stride to the bedroom. Vic laughed. &quot;What are they going to do? Fire me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Trey growled. &quot;I want to take advantage of being able to manhandle you while I still can.&quot;</p>
