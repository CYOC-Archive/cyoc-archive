<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Going to go third person and name the character Kyle)<br />
<br />
Kyle woke up the next morning with a rather odd tightness and wetness in his boxers. Investigating, he found that he had summed in the night and had a rather active morning wood which was rather unusual but paid it no mind as he got dressed. <br />
<br />
For Kyle, the day went mostly like it normally was, except that the morning wood hadn&#39;t died down at all since he woke up. In fact, he felt like it was getting worse and his pants felt very restrictive. Kyle felt very awkward to be walking around the school with a never-ending boner but he didn&#39;t seem to be the only one with the issue.<br />
<br />
Looking around to other people, he found a trend with other cross country members. The other Male members seemed to be moving rather awkwardly and possed the bulge one would have if they had wood. The female club members seemed to have a rather salty smell to them and made similar awkward leg movements.<br />
<br />
Besides that, Kyle found the day not to overly exciting. Well that was until lunch. At lunch, Kyle saw the girl he had a crush on walking past the cafeteria.<br />
<br />
The girl was named Rose, she was a senior to Kyle so about a year older or so. She was the daughter of some wealthy It Manager and possed some of the finest and expensive clothes that no one else had. Despite being wealthy, she possessed one of the most chirpy and kind personalities Kyle had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Rose also had the looks of a model. Her toned ass and legs from the cross country club activities made her clothes outline each curve; Her almond coloured hair flowed like a horse&#39;s mane that caught on the wind while she ran the track; her supple yet moderate breasts that complemented her physique. She was really beautiful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kyle. Noticed you were looking over at me so I came over. Anything you want?&quot; Rose chipped as she made her way next to Kyle<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing at all he he. I just glanced over and saw you walking past, that&#39;s all.&quot; Kyle awkwardly replied, to overwhelmed by the friendliness of Rose. <br />
<br />
Kyle also picked up on Rose&#39;s scent during the exchange, which was wonderful.While the other members of the cross country had a rather salty and musky smell, hers was just perfect. Sure it was salty, but it was also absolutely aromatic. Kyle just felt entranced by the musk of Rose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fair enough. Say Kyle, have you felt weird at all today. I dunno why but today I&#39;ve just felt weird.&quot; Rose thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Realising what Rose was getting at, Kyle responded &quot;Yeah, same here. But I&#39;d rather not go into detail about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose blushed in response &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t mean for you to say. I-I was just wondering if I was the only one, that&#39;s all.&quot; She looked down to the ground, squirming in her seat.<br />
<br />
Kyle, looking over, blushed too and they sat awkwardly next to one another. Due to the close proximity the both of them were in, some odd feeling welled inside them. <br />
<br />
Kyle just glanced over to the side where Rose was sitting, admiring her physique again. Something began to stir within Kyle. It was like a desire, a lust of some kind centred towards Rose. Fantasies playing in his mind, causing his feelings to get heated in a twisted sense of passion and love until... <br />
<br />
*RIP*<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kyle, did you hear something just rip now? It sounded like clothes just tore apart.&quot; Rose mumbled, still embarrassed to a degree <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, I think one of my spare socks in my gym kit tore apart. I-I&#39;ll go gave a look, be back in a bit.&quot; Kyle left to go to the toilet to investigate what ripped.<br />
<br />
Getting into one of the stalls, Kyle stripped down to see what ripped. As he pulled down his pants, he saw that the remnants of his boxers as they completely got torn apart by his now rather perky wood, which seemed to have become slightly discoloured with a hint of blackish tint to it. It also seemed larger and had more girth to it, although Kyle thought that might be due to the erection but then it could be why his underwear ripped.<br />
<br />
&quot;How the hell!? How the hell did my boner rip my boxers. They&#39;re completely ruined and were my only pair too which bloody sucks.&quot; Kyle ranted until he heard the door of the toilets open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Well I guess I&#39;m going commando for the rest of the day until I could find some spare boxers in the lost and found.&quot; Kyle muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
Kyle exited the stall and toilet room, awkwardly trying to make it not obvious that he was going commando. As Kyle left to room, he saw Rose sitting in the same he left her in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kyle, find out what happened?&quot; Rose worryingly asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I couldn&#39;t figure it out. Might try to have a better look when getting changed for the cross country club later today.&quot; Kyle responded <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope you can still take part in the club activities today. Anyway I have to go so see you at the club.&quot; Rose quickly departed, her ass swaying behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you later Rose.&quot; Kyle glanced over, seeing her swaying ass and causing an increasing pressure in his crotch &quot;Please don&#39;t release, I seriously don&#39;t have anything else to wear today.&quot; Kyle mumbled.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the day, Kyle had to deal with his problem he was facing. Luckily it didn&#39;t appear that anyone else had  noticed his problem so he managed to pass the day without any problem.<br />
<br />
Finishing the main part of the day, now was the part he was dreading; the cross country club. The problem wasn&#39;t to do with the activities themselves, it was the gym uniform and the changing room.<br />
<br />
The first issue is the changing room. Due to how they are designed, the boys will all get put into a single room where they can see each other change. That&#39;s only part of the issue as the room also has now privacy so the moment he attempts to change, everyone will see he has no underwear on.<br />
<br />
The second issue is the gym uniform itself. The material of the gym shorts would be the main problem that would make him a laughing stock as they would tightly fit against his crotch and Kyle&#39;s duck would be exposed to the outside world.<br />
<br />
Walking into the changing room for practice, Kyle noticed how everyone was just awkwardly waiting for something. Kyle sorta did the same as he took a corner and just sat in it, trying to make it as inconspicuous as possible that he wasn&#39;t wearing anything below his pants.<br />
<br />
For about 5 minutes, everyone just glanced over at each other. Sure there was the tiny bit of gossip but it just was a very awkward situation to be in. At one point, one of the boys perked up and asked a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;So erm... a-share we all waiting for each other to change or what. O-or is it that we are all in the same situation with... our wardrobes.&quot; The boy awkwardly asked<br />
<br />
Glancing around, everyone agreed. They all hated to admit it but they all had the same problem with their underwear and crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well let&#39;s just keep it between ourselves and change, no one outside of this room shall know what happens. Got it?&quot; Everyone including Kyle nodded in response.<br />
<br />
So silently, and awkwardly, everyone stripped and changed into the gym uniform. Since pretty much everyone knew what each other was going through, everyone kept to themselves and just didn&#39;t interact until everyone was done changing.<br />
<br />
When everyone was leaving, Kyle caught glimpses at how everyone was having wardrobe malfunctions with their shorts. While he knew that he would have one due to his raging boner and how the shorts were made of a very thin material, the fact he wasnt alone made him slightly more comfortable with the situation.<br />
<br />
Walking out onto the track field, Kyle was greeted with the girls already their and Coach Circe sat on a high chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well here are the fine studs themselves, you kept the mares waiting a while so nice to finally show up.&quot; Circe continues with her horse allegories<br />
<br />
Despite how they sounded, it seemed oddly right to Kyle to be called a &#39;stud&#39; by circe. It also was kinda fitting since horses run and he was part of the cross country club. There is also a second reason that it fits since Kyle is pretty sure his dick is about the size of a stallions penis by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now since I hadn&#39;t had much time to coach yesterday, in going to spend alot longer today then you normally would.&quot; Circe announced as she got a scooter from behind her chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Circe, what&#39;s the scooter for?&quot; One of the girls asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Good question young mare. Today you are actually going to do some cross country as I&#39;m going to guide you down some country routes to see how you actually do out there.&quot; Circe responded with enthusiasm <br />
<br />
&quot;Aslo what&#39;s with all the horse stuff like calling us mares and studs for the boys?&quot; The same girl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it a bad thing to call you that?&quot; Circe asked, losing some enthusiasm in the process <br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really. In fact it&#39;s kinda nice and I&#39;m pretty sure we all think it&#39;s nice to be called horses.&quot; The girl shyly responded, getting a few nods as well<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s good. In fact I&#39;ve come up with an idea.&quot; Circe then approached the girl, leaving her scooter.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what&#39;s the matter Coach?&quot; The girl meekly muttered <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing. But could you kindly get on you hands a knees.&quot; Circe subtly demanded<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sure.&quot; The girl complies as she proceeds to get on all fours. &quot;Why do you want me to AAHHHH!&quot; The girl screams as her clothes are ripped off her body by Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be alarmed. Since you like getting called a horse, I&#39;m gonna treat you like one. You don&#39;t mind that do you?&quot; Circe questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, in fact it&#39;s kinda like I want this. Although being naked is an issue yet I don&#39;t feel chilly at all.&quot; The girl shyly responds<br />
<br />
&quot;Well horses are adapted to live pretty much naked young mare. Also horses don&#39;t talk, they whine and neigh. You can do that right.&quot; Circe spoke<br />
<br />
The girl was about to talk back but realised what she must do and *Neighed* in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl. Now let&#39;s get you saddled up and let&#39;s begin the cross country course.&quot; Circe then put the girl into horse like gear designed for a human to wear and proceeded to mount her.<br />
<br />
Despite the scene that had just unfolded, many of the other club members seemed jealous of the girl. The other odd thing is, despite the naked girl in front of them, many of the boys didn&#39;t seemed turned on by her. All except on boy who had their dick sheath out of their shorts like a horse would with their penis, causing a rather odd scene yet no one seemed to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up mares and stallions. I&#39;m pretty sure you can catch up with a girl on all fours, if not then you should also try getting on all fours and seeing if you can catch up like that.&quot; Circe chuckled then turned back to her &#39;horse&#39; &quot;Hiyeaa&quot; Circe then spanked the ass of the girl she was riding who in turned began to gallop like a horse.<br />
<br />
The cross country club began their run as they chased after Circe and the girl.</p>
