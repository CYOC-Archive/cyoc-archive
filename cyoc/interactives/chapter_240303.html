<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon’s hands trembled as he looked at the personal computer in front of him. He knew that something evil and sinister was happening and his unawareness of the changes made it more intriguing to push the button even more and see what kind of fucked up things it could bring to this world. Simon had a devilish smile on his face as he greedily wanted more. He wanted to push, push, push and even more push the reason out of the equation. Would the machine fulfill his deepest fantasies or would the machine break first.<br />
<br />
The computer was emanating heat from it’s gray colored mechanical sides. The chronivac inside the PC was doing global scale changes to the world around it and it’s red and warm psychedelic metallic fumes made Simon’s brain go mad from it’s power. He didn’t want to do it but a dark shadowy side of Simon made him to do it. He pressed the enter as easily as breathed. Simon watched the chronivac to do it’s thing.<br />
<br />
16…<br />
<br />
16…<br />
<br />
16…<br />
<br />
Oddly the chronivac started to make loud noises as it’s fan begun to spin even faster. The heat it produced begun to feel like a small furnace. Heating the whole room in one second by 10 degrees. The room begun to turn red in color as all the pop-ups filled the screen. If the chronivac could have screamed it would had done so right now. Something awful was going to happen next.<br />
<br />
16… 15…<br />
<br />
Heather winced as the changes were making her younger. Mouth and pussy hole were getting tighter around the two sausages it held. Heather coughed at the surprising sensation as she felt her jaw getting too stretched from Ed’s cock. Heather’s tongue picked more subtle tones as her youthful sugary palette returned. Making sour and salt taste even worse.<br />
<br />
John was getting more aggressive with Heather’s shrinking pussy as she was once more fucked for the first time. Heather moaned and screamed as Ed reinserted his meat-rod back in Heather’s small mouth. John and Ed was treating Heather more roughly and didn’t care what Heather thought or cared about their treatment to her. Heather was slowly understanding her situation as her brain was slowly adapting with the changes.<br />
<br />
Heather dreamed that her first time would had been with a boy she loved but it was crushed as too old men were using her like a living sex toy. Heather had to suck Ed’s cock and take John’s too big salami inside her tiny hot pocket. Heather’s brain was slowly breaking as she couldn’t remember how many times her cherry had been popped. To her it was Heather’s first time but in reality she had come twenty times in one night. Heather’s darkened eyes, dry lips, overly rubbed vagina lips and sexually exhausted body and mind was nearing it’s limits. Heather didn’t enjoy the sex anymore. She was just a toy at this point. A simple pleasure giving machine for these two horny old men. Only liquid was coming Heather’s eyes as everything was starting to hurt at this point. To her pleasure from sex had gone like a smoke from a cigarette bud.<br />
<br />
Heather’s place in this new social hierarchy was to be a tender tight hole for men. She couldn’t be a whore as that was seen as profession meant for those who had graduated beyond middle school. Heather’s wasn’t one of them so her worth was getting lower in the crushing world.<br />
<br />
Heather begun to receive more memories of her past as her eyes flashed with gold colored glint. She remembered how her parents had kicked their ow daughter out of the house. The moment Heather’s parents heard that Heather was bullied their begun to process legal papers to evict their daughter just in case she becomes a dropout. On that fateful day when they knew what had happened Heather’s father dragged Heather by her hair and treated her own daughter like trash. Both parents reacted as if their only daughter had just died as Heather begged that she can fix her situation. Heather’s father took her wrath and anger on her daughter and pinned her down to the floor. Telling the new 15-year-old adult that she was now a stranger to them. Heather begged from them to keep her in their house but Heather’s father insisted that she has to leave. He couldn’t afford to keep a loser in their household. If her father’s work colleagues knew how soft he had become. They would bully him out of the work.<br />
<br />
Heather begged from her mother to keep her daughter in the house but even she couldn’t comprehend how much backlash it would cause at her work. Every female would reject Heather’s mother and she would be in same situation with her daughter. It was either Heather or her parents livelihood and own success. In the end Heather’s mother and father were heartless humans by Heather’s standards as they had to call police to escort their screaming and kicking ex-daughter away from their household.<br />
<br />
For many well-educated and well-earning people who had their college degrees and children. For them this was normal procedure to brutally disown their sons and daughters who couldn’t get past high-school. In their mind they only thought about the monetary loss and shame their own children would bring. There was no room for sympathy as maintaining an pristine image was more important. It was the only choice they had. Being soft and forgiving to own family meant signs of weakness.<br />
<br />
Heather had her first knock in her life as she was seen as worthless. A 15-year-old adult thrown to the streets to live on her own. Forgotten pennies under the sofa were more useful than what she was in this new world. Heather’s tight hole was the only thing she could offer to anyone at her age but even then there were thousand others who were in her situation. There were many unrecorded incidents where police had to pick up brutally assaulted and sexually abused family members that had been dropout from school. It was seen as normal. Or it was the normal. Heather’s parents did the loving thing they could do for her and let Heather to come up with a way to survive. Only some parents did this to their offspring and only if they had a tiny part of humanity left inside them. Countless young adults of both gender lived on the streets finding for a place to stay. Begging for money and opportunity for better life. Heather was now one of them. Crying on a pavement as her perfect family life had been ripped away from her.<br />
<br />
Heather’s remembered that John picked her up from the street with his car. John told Heather bold lies that she was going to be treated like a family member once she does what he and his boys tell her to do. Promising a chance of adopting her. In this new world adoption was a different kind of beast. It was a cruel legal option for rich people and for those who worked in high paying jobs. For many dropped out people it meant an opportunity to get their life back. For the adopter it meant life long servitude to the their household. Adopted women acted as personal sex workers, maids and cooks while adopted men acted as hard laborers. They called these people dropout workers and they had to be collared to separate them from the rest of the uneducated people. Dropout workers could have different names as many did and they were forced to keep the collar on them day and night to show everybody of their new status in the hierarchy. Laws gave big sanctions to those who laid finger on dropout workers which prevented abuse from happening. It was like an aura that protected them physically. Still emotional insulting was seen normal. Spiteful, jealous and greedy people wanted to still show their superiority towards dropout workers.<br />
<br />
That is why John said the things he said. Telling Heather bold lies. A promise he wasn’t going to fulfill even if he could have as he worked for the adoption company. That is how John had found Heather. That is why John picked her up and took her into his home. John knew what was happening behind the curtains as he was an arbiter for those who got their collars. John could have had anyone collared on a whim. He had that much power to control others. To John lying meant something else. To get what you wanted was normal and lying was easy way to get those things. What John did wasn’t unlawful. It was Heather’s fault for being naive dropout and believing what John sang to her. This is why John asked so boldly to have sex with Heather and that’s how they’ve reached to this point.<br />
<br />
Heather was a worthless human scum who had made her own decision. Why would John feel sympathy for human trash who was so lazy that she didn’t care about her own future. Heather only had her tight pussy left that John loved to fuck. That was Heather’s only worth. Once that’s taken she had nothing else. What can a hole offer if not purity. An apple that many men wanted and what many got by searching.<br />
<br />
“Dad. Let me have some of her pussy too. Heather’s mouth sucks ass.” Ed teased Heather as he pulled his cock from Heather’s lips.<br />
<br />
“No please. I beg you. I do anything to you. Please don’t throw me back to the streets. I get better. I promise. I’ll be a good hoe. Just let me live. Pleahse.” Heather pleaded and begged as Ed’s cock was waiting to be reinserted back to Heather’s mouth.<br />
<br />
John got even harder as Heather’s tears and snot begun run from her face. Ed inserted the cock back in Heather’s mouth as both of them got physically more rougher. The John’s plaps became louder while Ed pushed her cock deeper down on Heather’s throat.<br />
<br />
Heather with teared eyes had to prove her worth to both of them. She didn’t want to die in the streets as a homeless person. Heather didn’t want to go back there. Her life was either to be an obedient sex toy for men or die homeless. To Heather the option was set in stone the moment she jumped inside the car. <br />
<br />
“Heather. Tell me how much you love me.” Ed laughed while pushing his meat down on Heather’s throat.<br />
<br />
“Ay Wavh Yah!” Heather coughed.<br />
<br />
“What was that? Could you repeat that?” Ed teased heather.<br />
<br />
“AY WAVH YAH! AY WAVH YAH! AY WAVH YAH!” Heather cried and moaned as Ed’s cock was rubbing Heather’s throat.<br />
<br />
John kept teasing Heather by telling that if she acted like a proper whore they would consider adopting her to the family. Heather’s mood was all over the place but even she didn’t care. All she cared about was to stay alive and hope that John kept his promise to her as the spit-roasting made the bed squeak.<br />
<br />
Suddenly John put both of his arms on Heather’s throat like a maniac and begun to choke her. Heather couldn’t breath as two strong arms were on her wind pipe. Ed’s lengthy cock was her saving grace as every push gave her just enough oxygen to breath. Heather was gagging for air as John let go off from her throat. Heather didn’t pass out but couldn’t retaliate to what had just happened to her.<br />
<br />
“Ed. Did you see that?” John asked from his son.<br />
<br />
“I did. She’s special.” Ed replied back as they both stopped.<br />
<br />
Heather was gasping for air while sobbing. Not for the pain but for the joy that she was feeling. Ed called Heather special which made Heather smile like a lunatic. She didn’t mind the burning pain in her throat or in her lungs. She didn’t mind how her pussy had been expanded. Heather was treated like human. Not even her father called her special.<br />
<br />
“Are you actually going to adopt her?” Ed asked from his father.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. You saw her reaction just minute ago. She’s perfect wife material for you. A perfect obedient young wife to bare your kids.” John replied back.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Son. I’m going to handle the paperwork for you and you take the girl as your wife.”<br />
<br />
“How about mom? Is she going to?”<br />
<br />
“No. That girl is a whore in her eyes. Your mom doesn’t care who births your children and I’m sure that she can see from this girl’s eyes that she’s a wonderful woman for my grandson’s genes.”<br />
<br />
Ed looked at his dad for a long while and accepted Heather as his wife. Heather let out a victorious wheeze as she had no idea what was going on. But worse was right around the corner. What Heather didn’t know was that getting married to someone meant fate even worse than death. You were seen as baby making factory that was used until you couldn’t give any more children to the world. Anybody in the same family as your spouse could use you to produce an offspring out of your hole. The married woman or man was going to be loaded with so many pills and tinctures to produce so creamy fertility-virility bomb that not even natural forces couldn’t prevent it from happening. The whole body was going to be pumped full of harmful chemicals that at the end of five year cycle the side effects felt like dementia. Adding five more meant partial lobotomy and after five more years the person didn’t grasp the world around them. All they knew was to swallow the fistful of pills down their throat, drink gallons of liquids and be in constant delirious state to either be fucked or be in state to give painless births. That was what being married meant. A twisted new way to increase population by force.<br />
<br />
Simon looked at the screen in the computer room as the flicker caused by the machine had halted it’s global scale transformation. The computer presented Simon a choice. To continued with the changes or turn back the time to the moment before they arrived inside the computer room with Ed. What was he going to choose?</p>
