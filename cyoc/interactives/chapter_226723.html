<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The smell trail that Thomas saw earlier went into his brother Germain’s bedroom. He was asleep, but he could still feel the nice smell coming in, and so the changes took place while he was dreaming.<br />
<br />
Dreaming of a green field, like his brother before. Germain was lying on the pasture and could see cows around him, hearing their voices, communicating through gibberish. The noise soothed him, along with the breeze that moved the grass embracing and caressing his body. He couldn’t get up, though Germain didn’t mind. There was no need for struggle, as that was the landscape he desired to see every day, accompanied by like-minded people.<br />
<br />
Leaving a sensation similar to a massage, Germain’s body started to grow, mainly fattening but with a slight increase in height as well, him being already tall. He especially liked how his softening skin jiggled, the gentle pressure of two horns growing on his head, and how his now flattened pink nose moved close to his mouth to push outwards joining together. From his recently formed muzzle, Germain stuck his tongue out, suddenly feeling hot, he panted, his tongue was longer, thicker, and more sensitive. The changes went further than his skin, his skull reshaping through sudden elongations and contractions. His forehead had decreased in size, the position of his eyes moved to opposite sides, his jaw followed a similar motion as the mandible pushed back. His lips thinned until he had none on his wider mouth. His pupils expanded to consume the iris, and his eyes were soon covered by his long and unkept brown hair, the only two things protruding from it were the white horns and his changed oval-shaped ears<br />
<br />
Germain had finally managed to stand up, just to see that he was left alone on the meadow. Unbothered by the inexplicable emptiness, he took this time to feel his bovine face. He saw two hooves approaching his face and stopped, stared at the three fingers on each hand, covered by hooves, and proceeded with his examination of his face. Nothing was out of place, though he could remember a face much different than his present one.<br />
<br />
He was interrupted by his trembling legs, bulking up with muscle from his calves to his thighs. His feet, two-toed now, had turned into hooves, and he tried to keep his balance with the sudden change in weight that came from the surge of muscle. Once that stopped, he felt something beneath his big buttocks: a tail, though his examination of it was also interrupted by yet another surge of fat going to his belly and chest. His body was gaining curves at the same time he was gaining weight, and this caused him to sweat. The pants earlier had become moans now, moans that grew stronger, sounding like the deep cry of an animal. His gut, plump from lard, replaced his once slim and firm figure. Mounds of fat formed in his chest, and while he fondled them they continued growing, increasing the strength of his cries until he let out a “MOOO!”, falling to the grass again, being swallowed by the ground.<br />
<br />
In the dark void into which the anthropomorphic cow fell, Germain felt the climax of his changes. His flaccid penis was retracting along with his scrotum, leaving his crotch flat while his testicles inside turned into ovaries. The crotch grew some hair now, and the lips of her vulva formed, slightly showing her still shrinking penis, which turned into her clitoris.<br />
<br />
Geraldine woke up agitated and sweating. She got up from her bed and turned on the lights, though it was still difficult to see with her messy hair obscuring her view. She moved her strands of hair and faced the mirror of the dresser. She was taken aback by the sight of the bovine creature reflected in it, with brown patches in his white skin, strong legs and arms, and a stout motherly figure. A modest smile appeared on her face, turning back to the bed, where she found ripped plaid trousers and boxers, as well as a wet stain that made her blush. “Oh dear,” she said in a deep yet tender voice, “Boys can make quite a mess.” She huffed, stepping out of the room, making her way to the living room, every step making her breasts and butt bounce slightly. <br />
<br />
At the living room was Thomas alone, who was surprised by the appearance of another anthro animal. Geraldine approached the boy, “Hi sweetie!”, but Thomas backed away, stuttering, unsure of who this was, although he was more afraid of being right in that this was his brother. The cow felt a little hurt by the unwelcoming aura of Thomas, “Is there anything wrong, Tommy?” <br />
“Germain is that you?”<br />
<br />
Geraldine chuckled in response, “So that’s what it was.” She sat on the sofa, looked again at Thomas and smiled. “See, I am not Germain, I am actually Geraldine. Think of me as your big sister.” Other steps could be heard coming from the hallway leading the bedrooms, with Nicholas emerging naked. Thomas looked away and covered his eyes as fast as he could, while Geraldine reprimanded the horseman. “Nicholas! Have some decency, please!”<br />
<br />
“Says the cow that’s letting it all hang out,” replied a snarky Nicholas, heading towards the front door.<br />
<br />
Geraldine got flustered by the comment, but she couldn’t deny that she came off as bit hypocritical. The topic changed quickly as she noticed that Nicholas was heading outside. “Are you going out like that?”<br />
<br />
“I just felt like I needed a good jog.” With that affirmation Nicholas closed the door, leaving Geraldine without a chance to ask anything else, and Thomas with more questions.<br />
<br />
“Um, I’m going to see if there’s anything for me to wear in Nick’s closet.” Thomas heard Geraldine’s steps getting farther and he slowly uncovered his eyes to check if anyone was still there. Once again he was left alone in the living room, though more confused than before.</p>
