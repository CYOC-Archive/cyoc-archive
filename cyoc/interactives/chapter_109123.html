<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny and Harry&#39;s day continued on with Harry&#39;s mind still dwelling on the nightmare that he&#39;d had and the potential fears that it represented. He knew that Jenny was still practicing her mantra to be mentally ready and confident for the likely confrontation with her parents, but a part of Harry&#39;s mind worried that the Harpers weren&#39;t the real problem. If angered enough, her parents might disown her and leave, and while that would certainly be rough, it would leave Jenny safe and in Moon Lake to get a new start. And if what he&#39;d heard, if that happened, she&#39;d get a new family thanks to both her marrying him and gaining his parents as in-laws and William Anderson and his family offering to fill in as surrogate parents for her. That wasn&#39;t a problem.<br />
<br />
The problem was Dieter Wilhelm who had the real potential to be trouble. From what Jenny had told him about the man that had been obsessed with her, he didn&#39;t exactly have the best of personalities or pasts. He&#39;d obviously been spoiled and was in a position where he never payed for any mistakes that he&#39;d made. It had to be something that would give him both confidence and a feeling of superiority over everyone else. He&#39;d also already sent one henchman that was likely out to kill him, so Harry wouldn&#39;t put it past Dieter Wilhelm  to try something more direct and violent.<br />
<br />
His thoughts over this remained in his mind as he went through the day and picked up Jenny for her latest therapy session. She was quick to notice that he still looked to be deep in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still worried over that nightmare?&quot; Jenny asked to him as he moved park his car at a space close to Frances Twist&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Harry said with a sigh, &quot;it may have only been a nightmare, but that doesn&#39;t remove the fact that it&#39;s quite possible that something like that could happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them climbed out of the car and walked onto the sidewalk. As they arrived, Jenny wrapped an arm around Harry&#39;s and held herself close to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but I&#39;m sure the people doing all the security work will make sure things remain quiet,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;a group of werelions providing muscle... and the Skulk&#39;s security forces and the two police doing the same. I&#39;d bet any guest they see or smell as suspicious will get frisked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;d work at a wedding,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;particularly if they don&#39;t do it to EVERY guest at the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
They slowly entered the clinic with Harry holding the door for Jenny. She smiled to him and walked up to the counter that Rudy manned. Harry watched her as she walked toward Rudy&#39;s desk and continued to think over things. She was beautiful, in all her forms, including when they had first met and began dating, in her present human form, and in her vixen form, and he loved her dearly. He wanted her to always be happy and losing him would have the potential for that and would put her at Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s mercy. He tried to think of someway to keep Jenny safe, but most of what he could come up with only serve to lead to more trouble. He did his best to pay attention to what was going on around him and he smiled to Jenny as she approached him. She sat down and smiled back to him, rubbing his knee with one hand. He smiled to her as they waited.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long to wait, as Frances soon emerged from her office and came out to where both Harry and Jenny could see them. She gave a small smile and then beckoned them forward with her free hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in, come in,&quot; Frances beckoned, &quot;we&#39;re all doing well, I trust?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About as well as can be,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;we had a little trouble on Saturday, but our Sunday was good and got things clear so that we&#39;ll have things in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is good,&quot; Frances said politely as she ushered the two of them into her office and therapy office.<br />
<br />
&quot;I even offered some suggestions that might help keep things under control until the wedding,&quot; Jenny continued as she walked in and sat down, with Harry sitting on the couch beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Frances commented as she collected her notebook, &quot;hopefully your plan works.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, have you continued to practice your mantra to remind yourself that you are your own person?&quot; Frances asked to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Jennifer Harper soon to be Jennifer Jenkins, and I am my own person,&quot; Jenny said confidently remembering the mantra she&#39;d been given to practice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Frances commented, &quot;Now... when we were last here, we were dealing with logic based reasons you could use to argue to stay in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny nodded, &quot;and they could work... Though, it may not be easily. Especially if my folks aren&#39;t exactly rational...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s ultimately where we can add other points you can use, such as some of the economic reasons you also mentioned,&quot; Frances answered.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, given that we are also looking for finding ways to stand up to your parents and show that you are you are your own person, promising a means help them get out of the gutter, you cannot let it stay there,&quot; Frances spoke firmly, &quot;so if you end up using them, you will need to also including something that will demonstrate that you care for your family and choose to do so because of that... not because you&#39;re obligated to or that you&#39;re tying to barter to do so... That would crush any attempt at freedom on your part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny blinked and nodded, &quot;Yeah... I&#39;d suppose my dad would take that as trying to offer a deal and begging for permission. And I am my own person. I may want him to approve, but I do not NEED him to approve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked over Harry and smiled. Harry managed a smile back as she leaned forward and hugged him before giving him a brief kiss on the cheek. That did make him smile as well. As they broke the kiss, Jenny noticed that Frances was also nodding. Harry kept one army wrapped around Jenny&#39;s shoulders when Frances spoke up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And working with your mantra will help with that,&quot; Frances said to Jenny before focusing more toward Harry, &quot;and in the meantime... I got a message from Rudy that you&#39;ve asked for some work with Harry for today&#39;s session?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Harry gasped.<br />
<br />
Jenny gave his hand a strong squeeze before she spoke, &quot;Just some confidence booster that bad dream he had won&#39;t come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen...&quot; Harry said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay to have nightmares, Harry,&quot; Frances commented, &quot;things that frighten us in ways can do that. Even I&#39;ve had them from time to time. And in your position where you are so key to Jenny&#39;s recovery and confidence... your confidence is also important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;from everything I&#39;ve heard from both of you... you&#39;ve done a lot to help Jenny adapt to becoming a were and helping her with her own confidence... and as werefoxes, you&#39;ve clearly bonded to each other. What troubles one of you is surely going to trouble the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry looked to Jenny and then sighed, &quot;Well... it&#39;s really only one nightmare, but it was very vivid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; Frances said to him.</p>
