<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before long, Zoey and Ashlee reached Zoey&#39;s home. Zoey rang the doorbell, and her mom answered the door. &quot;Welcome home, Zoey!&quot; she said brightly. &quot;I see you brought your girlfriend. Ashlee, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Lisa,&quot; Zoey said. &quot;She and I actually have something really important to tell you and Brian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then come on in,&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don&#39;t get why your parents let you call them by their first names,&quot; Ashlee whispered to Zoey as they followed Lisa into the house. &quot;My parents would, like, hit the roof if I did that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was actually <i>their</i> idea,&quot; Zoey answered. &quot;They say they like to feel like we&#39;re on the same level, nobody over or under anyone else in the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what they&#39;d think of pack ranks,&quot; Ashlee giggled.<br />
<br />
Inside, they found Zoey&#39;s dad Brian reading in the living room. &quot;Hi, Zoey. Oh, and you brought Ashlee. Hi there, Ashlee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Brian,&quot; Ashlee said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was school today, Zoey?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty great,&quot; Zoey said. &quot;Kinda tiring, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want a beer?&quot; asked Brian, offering Zoey a bottle of Budweiser. &quot;It&#39;ll help de-stress you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashlee flinched. &quot;Never gonna get used to seeing your parents offering you booze, Zoey. Not having to drink behind your parents&#39; back is, like, against the natural order or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian chuckled. &quot;You&#39;ll find we&#39;re a very progressive family, Ashlee. We understand that Zoey&#39;s mature enough to make important choices for herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoey raised a hand. &quot;I&#39;ll skip the beer today, Brian. And for a lot of days, actually. There&#39;s something I really, <i>really</i> need to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh? Must be something pretty serious to make you pass up a beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Zoey sat down, facing her parents. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant, guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Brian said, stroking his chin. &quot;Well, I suppose you know what you&#39;re doing, Zoey. I know you can easily support the baby between Lisa and my salaries and all the money you make off your social media career. Would it be intruding to ask who&#39;s the father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; Zoey smiled. &quot;I <i>want</i> you to know.&quot; She took Ashlee&#39;s hand in hers. &quot;It&#39;s Ashlee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Ashlee</i>?&quot; Lisa repeated skeptically. &quot;Ashlee Kline? But... that&#39;s not possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the truth,&quot; Zoey insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But two girls can&#39;t have a baby without a sperm donor,&quot; Brian said. &quot;It&#39;s physically impossible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For two <i>human</i> girls, maybe,&quot; Zoey smiled. &quot;But there&#39;s something kinda special about me and Ashlee.&quot; Zoey took a deep breath before the big reveal. &quot;We&#39;re werehyenas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa and Brian&#39;s eyes bugged out wildly. &quot;Could... could you repeat that?&quot; asked Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said that I&#39;m a werehyena,&quot; Zoey said. &quot;So&#39;s Ashlee. It&#39;s like werewolves, only with hyenas instead of wolves. We were recruited by this werehyena we go to school with who was looking to start up a pack. She used this sex magic thing to transform us, and now we can turn into buff hyena-people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha... what the hell?!&quot; Brian choked out, nearly falling out of his chair.<br />
<br />
Lisa somehow kept her cool. &quot;And how, exactly, does being a werehyena allow you to have a baby with Ashlee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werehyenas are herm... hermaphrodites,&quot; Zoey explained, taking a moment to get the pronunciation just right. &quot;In other words, they&#39;re an entirely &#39;female&#39; species whose members possess both a penis and a vagina in their hyena-person forms. It&#39;s really very simple: Ashlee put hir penis in my vagina and filled me with sperm, which got me pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of this makes any sense!&quot; Brian protested. &quot;Werebeasts aren&#39;t real!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They totes are,&quot; Zoey insisted. &quot;So are witches, vampires, faeries, demons, angels, ghosts, and yokai, among other things. There&#39;s a whole supernatural world lurking just out of human sight. Stokerville&#39;s actually full of them. That gothy von Karnstein family that lives in the old manor on the edge of town is really a vampire clan. That weird commune in the woods full of gruff, hairy people? That&#39;s a werewolf pack. There&#39;s a hidden shop for magicals on Grimm Street run by a witch. You know that nightclub, Inferno? It&#39;s run by succubi. Magic is everywhere, and I&#39;m part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit hard to accept that without proof,&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Ashlee turned to Zoey. &quot;Wanna show them, boo?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoey nodded. &quot;Totally.&quot; She turned to her parents. &quot;Me and Ashlee are gonna transform. That should be enough proof, right? Now, we&#39;re gonna have to strip. Our hyenagirl forms are so muscly that they&#39;d wreck our clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okaaaaay...&quot; Brian said skeptically.<br />
<br />
Zoey and Ashlee hastily undressed. Once they were fully naked, they willed their transformations to begin. Fur began to sprout all over the two girls&#39; bodies, thickening until it completely hid their suntanned skin from view. Wild hyena manes grew down their backs.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK?!!&quot; Brian shouted in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try not to panic,&quot; Lisa said, forcing her voice to remain even and almost calm as she steadied her husband.<br />
<br />
Zoey and Ashlee&#39;s bones began to crack and pop as they reshaped. Their feet became paws and their nails grew out into wicked claws. Tails pushed out from just above their asses, extra pairs of breasts sprouted just below the girls&#39; rapidly expanding primary pairs. Their faces pushed out into hyena muzzles, and their ears migrated to the tops of their heads and grew big and round as their teeth sharpened. Last of all, the girls&#39; pussies moved backwards as their clits swelled into massive cocks with plump ballbags dangling beneath them.<br />
<br />
Brian and Lisa gaped in shock. Brian broke the silence. &quot;I... you... what did you... WHAT THE FUCK?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the true me, Brian,&quot; Zoey said, hir voice now a contralto. &quot;The supernatural is real, and I&#39;m in a werehyena pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now do you believe that I&#39;m the baby&#39;s dad?&quot; Ashlee asked, fondling hir dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is... a lot... to take in,&quot; Brian said, still trembling slightly. &quot;I&#39;m going to try, though. Zoey, you&#39;re still my daughter even if you&#39;re a werehyena. Lisa and I will do whatever it takes to keep your secret or help with the baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will the baby be a werehyena?&quot; asked Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Zoey nodded, &quot;but she&#39;ll seem like a normal human girl until her thirteenth birthday when she shifts for the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you chosen a name for her yet?&quot; asked Brian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bailey Taylor Kline,&quot; Ashlee responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t wait to see her,&quot; Brian smiled. &quot;I could get used to being a grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I can drag her away from the pack long enough to introduce you!&quot; Zoey laughed. &quot;They&#39;re all excited as hell, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you tell us more about your pack?&quot; asked Lisa. &quot;Are you moving in with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not soon,&quot; said Zoey. &quot;My alpha hasn&#39;t chosen where our territory will be, and she wants us to graduate from high school before we take that step. Until then, we&#39;re living with our parents. Our alpha&#39;s Selena Lyall, my classmate. She&#39;s from the town werewolf pack. You know, that one everyone thinks is just a weird survivalist commune. She wasn&#39;t a werewolf herself; the gene didn&#39;t take. Her parents made it plain to her that she&#39;d have to shift for the first time by her eighteenth birthday or be kicked out of the pack. Well, her vampire girlfriend Tatiana von Karnstein took her to a witch&#39;s shop called Morgana&#39;s Services for the Strange to see if they could buy something to make Selena shift. They found something, but Selena decided she&#39;d rather start her own werebeast pack than try to fit in with the one her parents ran. She chose to become a werehyena, and she&#39;s been building up a pack ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s the pack structured?&quot; asked Brian. &quot;You&#39;ve been saying &#39;alpha&#39; a lot, and you know how Lisa and I feel about hierarchy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoey laughed nervously. &quot;Well, werehyenas have a different way of looking at things. You gotta remember, we&#39;re just as much an animal as we are human, so we have to use some animal thinking. That includes animal pack structure. There&#39;s an alpha on top and a beta backing hir up. Under them are a bunch of specialists like the Mistress of the Hunt, the Lady of War, the Queen of the Dance, the shaman, the storyteller, and the trickster. They have absolute authority in their fields. Like, only the alpha or beta can overrule the Mistress of the Hunt on hunting, the Lady of War on battle, the shaman on religion, <i>et cetera</i>. Under them are the deltas the elite werebeasts who are the most talented warriors and hunters. Under the deltas are the gammas, the Average Janes. Last of all is the omega, the lowest ranking werebeast in the pack. Selena said it&#39;s like a sort of cabin boy... or cabin girl/herm in our case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure I like the sound of this,&quot; Lisa said warily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Puh-lease!&quot; Ashlee scoffed. &quot;Didn&#39;t you guys hear what your daughter said about animal psychopathy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you mean &#39;animal <i>psychiatry</i>,&#39; babe,&quot; Zoey laughed. Shi turned to face hir parents again. &quot;Ashlee&#39;s right, though. Now that I&#39;m a werehyena, this kind of thing comes naturally to me. Ashlee&#39;s a delta, I&#39;m a gamma, and that all feels so freaking <i>natural</i> to me now. I have a place, I have a purpose. It&#39;s great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Lisa said slowly, &quot;as long as you <i>like</i> it, I guess. After all, we wouldn&#39;t kinkshame you if you turned out to be into BDSM.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Zoey chuckled, &quot;but that&#39;s more Skyler and Hannah&#39;s thing. They&#39;re our beta and omega.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah I&#39;ve heard of,&quot; Brian said. &quot;Hannah Dershowitz, right? I golf with her dad on Saturdays. But who&#39;s Skyler?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you haven&#39;t heard?&quot; Zoey asked. &quot;Skyler&#39;s my friend Stella Bentley. Shi came out as non-binary the other day, and shi&#39;s changing hir name to something more gender-neutral.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian smiled. &quot;Good to see Stella&#39;s... I mean... Good to see <i>Skyler&#39;s</i> finally standing up to her tyrant mother. I guess her father&#39;s finally backing her up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Zoey answered. &quot;He&#39;s been great, apparently. Oh, and Skyler isn&#39;t a &#39;her&#39;. Shi&#39;s a &#39;hir&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shay? Hare?&quot; Lisa repeated confusedly. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m following.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re a set of pronouns that werehyenas use in their herm forms,&quot; Zoey answered. &quot;I&#39;m a &#39;shi&#39; right now, but I&#39;ll be a &#39;she&#39; again when I go back to human form. But Skyler doesn&#39;t feel fully female even in hir human form, so shi always goes by herm pronouns. It&#39;s like how that other non-binary I know, Beck Hamilton, goes by &#39;they/them.&#39; On that topic, Beck&#39;s a werehyena, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded. &quot;Got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who else is in the pack?&quot; asked Brian.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean besides me, Ashlee, Selena, Skyler, Hannah, and Beck?&quot; asked Zoey. &quot;Well, the entire girls&#39; basketball team from school is in, for one thing. Taylor Wagner&#39;s our shaman. Oh, and Beck&#39;s girlfriend Brianna&#39;s in. We&#39;ve also got Ellie Rubenstein and her girlfriend Harper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Summer from Cheer Squad,&quot; Ashlee chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s Lily from Drama Club and that quiet girl, Jenna McSweeney,&quot; Zoey went on. &quot;I think that&#39;s everyone for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re transmorphing the rest of the pack tomorrow,&quot; Ashlee said.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Transmorph&#39; isn&#39;t a word,&quot; Zoey corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is too!&quot; Ashlee pouted.<br />
<br />
Zoey whipped out hir trusty phone, shifted back into human form for the nimble fingers, and looked up Wiktionary. &quot;Well, whaddaya know! You&#39;re right for once, Ashlee!&quot; She gave the cheerleader a congratulatory hug. She looked back to her parents. &quot;So, you&#39;re good with all this, guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled at her daughter. &quot;When have we ever not supported you? If you think being part of this werehyena pack is right for you, then who are we to tell you you&#39;re wrong? It&#39;s your life, not ours. We give you all the freedom you need to be with your new packmates, and we&#39;ll offer whatever help you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Brian smiled.<br />
<br />
Zoey smiled, tears in her eyes. &quot;Thanks, guys. You can&#39;t imagine how much it means to be able to share such an important part of myself with you. It would suck <i>soooo</i> bad to have to keep my true self from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never have to do that,&quot; said Brian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could, like, tell <i>my</i> parents about being a werehyena,&quot; Ashlee sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe someday,&quot; Zoey said, squeezing her mate&#39;s hand. &quot;For now, let&#39;s just be excited about the baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed!&quot; Brian smiled. &quot;Sure hope she looks like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In which form?&quot; Zoey joked, causing the entire room to erupt with laughter.</p>
