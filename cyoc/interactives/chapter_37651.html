<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Cray and Guy sat there in front of the TV, Guy was feverishly trying to figure out a solution to their mess.  He was now a 500 pound muscle-bound freak, while his new friend, Cray, was sitting at a smaller, but still substantial 350 pounds of solid muscle.<br />
<br />
They were quite the sight to behold, two muscle monsters, bigger than any bodybuilders on earth, laying back practically nude with little more than shredded boxer shorts and throw blankets to keep them decent.  They sat, drinking beers together on two separate couches, since they each, especially Guy took up a whole one.  Though it was a bit more difficult for Guy to drink a beer, as his biceps and forearm muscles limited his movement at his elbow to a fair extent, as well as his monster-sized pecs kept jumping up into the path of his arm as he brought the beer to his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, for as much as this kinda sucks,&quot; said Guy, &quot;it's still a little cool.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I suppose it is.&quot; agreed Cray looking down and admiring his enormous pecs.<br />
&quot;I wonder if there are even any clothes big enough to fit me?&quot; wondered Guy aloud.<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I am sure they have SOMETHING big enough for me!&quot; Cray said, jamming his thumb into his pecs, hardly even making an indentation as he did so.<br />
&quot;So do you have the bottle of ointment with you?&quot; Guy asked.<br />
&quot;What the hell would you want it for?!&quot; Cray replied, &quot;Don't you think you're big enough already!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course I do!&quot; Guy said, &quot;I just want to see if it has any other instructions on it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh!  Good idea!&quot; Cray said, struggling to stand up as he waddled into the next room to get the bottle.  He had since changed into another pair of boxer shorts, his first having been completely destroyed by his hulking out earlier, but the new boxers were extraordinarily tight and straining across his giant muscled butt and crotch.  They had also split slightly up both legs as he slid them on over his mammoth quads.<br />
<br />
Cray returned, waddling into the living room and started to say, &quot;Here it...&quot;<br />
Just then there was a knock on the door.<br />
&quot;Who's that!?&quot; Guy said in a panic, while trying to heave his tremendously muscled body off the broken couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Cray said, looking at the frosted glass window in the door.  &quot;I forgot my buddy Matt was coming over tonight too!  What are we gonna do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cray?  You in there Cray?&quot;  Came Matt's voice from the doorstep.<br />
&quot;I guess you gotta let him in.&quot; Guy said.<br />
Yea...Coming, Matt!&quot;  Cray said, throwing the bottle to Guy who had now managed to get his titanic muscled frame up off the couch, and now stood, with legs spread wide to accommodate both of his tree-trunk sized thighs.<br />
<br />
Cray made his way over to the door and opened it quickly, saying loudly, &quot;Hey, Matt!  Come on in!&quot;  Matt, who hardly had time to blink, was then pulled inside by one of Cray's huge arms and had the door slammed behind him.<br />
<br />
Matt was flabbergasted.  He stared at Cray for a long time before saying, &quot;Cray?  What the HELL happened to you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...It's a long story!  But my new buddy, Guy over here,&quot; Cray gestured with his thick, meaty arm and hand to Guy, and Matt looked over to Guy, who he had not yet noticed and jumped slightly as his eyes grew enormous as they took in the huge muscle freak standing half-naked in his friend's living room.  Guy smiled weakly and gave a little wave, &quot;my new buddy Guy, we met at an ointment store, and he suggested that I try this ointment, see, for my muscles after my work outs, and it turns out that this ointment makes you grow muscles, basically, to make a long story short that is.<br />
<br />
Matt just stood there a few more moments and digested what had just been said.  He still couldn't comprehend how some apparent &quot;magical&quot; ointment could turn his friend and this stranger into extreme, larger-than-life, muscle-bound freaks.  Matt was of average build, he didn't work out much, but wasn't skinny nor was he what anyone would call chubby, he just was simply average.  He never had a problem with his friend, Cray's bodybuilding, but this was just too much, too fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on in, and have a beer!&quot; Cray said to his friend, putting one massive muscular arm around Matt, nearly causing his knees to buckle and leading him into the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;So-so-so how does this ointment thing work again?&quot;  Matt said, still trying to figure everything out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you want some?&quot; Cray asked him.<br />
&quot;Yeah!  You should try it!&quot; Guy replied, coming towards him with the bottle.<br />
&quot;NO! NO! Don't!  I don't want any of it! Please!&quot; Matt struggled, but Cray was already holding him down as Guy came forward and poured several ounces of the ointment down Matt's resisting throat.<br />
<br />
Cray and Guy were so excited and blinded by their want to see what Matt would become that they didn't even notice or hear his protests to what they were doing, and went ahead with it.<br />
<br />
Finally they released Matt from their grip and stepped back.<br />
&quot;Holy shit, man, how much did you give him!?&quot; Cray asked glancing at the bottle.<br />
&quot;Oh, crap, I think I gave him everything that was left!&quot; Guy said looking down at the now empty bottle from over his substantial pecs.<br />
&quot;What the hell is wrong with you guys!!??&quot;  Matt screamed.  &quot;What is going to happen to me!?&quot;  He cried looking up at the two massive muscle monsters standing over him.<br />
<br />
It was only then that Guy and Cray realized what they had done...</p>
