<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And so more time passed, and more time as a female deer. It was obvious Fall had come with the changing of the colors of the forest, cooler weather, and shorter days. That didn&#39;t worry you though. You had enough experience as both a doe and navigating the forest that you still kept track of food sources or opportunistic when you found something out of the ordinary. Your fur was also growing accordingly, and you never felt particularly chilly. Funny enough even your udders would never feel discomfort, it could feel a chilly breeze hit it but never enough to hurt or flinch over.<br />
<br />
You really did feel like you were getting limited by your deer brain at this point. As you got comfortable as a doe, you did do various exercises to try and keep up with your sentience, but there were signs your intelligence or sapience was getting affected. You were feeling more skittish. It was getting harder to read as you came across material, including the same info kiosks you visited before. You felt an actual need and comfort to be around the herds when before it was a conscious choice. Now none of this was something that would overtake you, and thanks to the exercises this might be something you would miss otherwise. The Titan said having a Deer Brain didn&#39;t mean a straight IQ drop or identity loss, so maybe you were literally just dealing with biology limitations? Only more time and research would really tell.<br />
<br />
One of the major issues that came with Fall was Hunting Season. You had an idea it was coming from postings on the Kiosks, but hearing sporadic shots and sometimes even seeing the hunters themselves confirmed it. You kept your distance when possible, and according to both the hunting season info and sometimes the hunters if within earshot, they would leave does like you alone. And if there was any chance of confusion, your udders seemed to help. Still, you were careful in-case you came across one hunter that couldn&#39;t tell the difference or didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
You also tried to be smarter about it. You hanged in rougher terrain, ate in less populated areas, and knew of some more isolated water sources. Unfortunately this had the affect of keeping you away from any sources of civilization including the campsites and kiosks. If there was a chance to be caught off guard with deer brain, it might be with reading at least. <br />
<br />
From this came some frustration, and then an idea to relieve it. You masturbated regularly of course, but the idea of sex with a buck became more appealing as the hunting season bothered you. One day you just let it happen. You saw lone buck during one of your trots, and rather than continue on, you stopped and took in the situation. Despite time as a doe so far, you were not sure if it was a particularly impressive specimen including its antlers. You didn&#39;t care though and wanted to get it over with before you got cold feet. Or is that hooves now? Heh heh, at least you could still have humor. <br />
<br />
You saw plenty of Deer getting railed by bucks in the past month, so you decided to just walk up to the buck, turn around, and took an oddly natural pose you&#39;ve seen the females take when receptive. The buck was taken aback (you were glad you could read deer extremely well at this point) but once it felt like he got the smell of you and you heat, he quickly went to mount you. It awkward feeling most of his weight on you and he was trying to find your vagina with his penis, but he found it within a few seconds and went right in.<br />
<br />
You saw stars, you made a sound you didn&#39;t know you could make, but luckily your stance helped keep you in place while you were having one of your most powerful orgasm as a deer. But it didn&#39;t last long, there was only a few thrusts and the feel of a liquid deposited in, and shortly the buck got off you and walked away. The whole experience lasted less then a minute, but you still felt the afterglow or the orgasm so you decided to rest on the ground a bit as you took it in.<br />
<br />
From here sex with bucks became a very regular event. Outside of very obvious signs that danger was nearby or otherwise more important business, you felt the bucks&#39; own sex drives, your heat, and in-general receptiveness (you avoided any deer foreplay) made it very easy to have sex when you wanted it. As you got more experience, you did wish the bucks did more then hump you a few times and blow their load, but in the end they were just animals operating on instinct. You still had a mind-blowing orgasm each time, thanks the the sensitivity options you guessed from the customization settings, and tried to do somethings here and there to spice up the sex, but really you couldn&#39;t make the bucks do much. One of your favorite things at least was to try and have sex near reflective water sources to give yourself a show of animalistic sex or adding in one of your attempts to spice it up. You were pretty sure normal deer weren&#39;t suppose to make lewd faces (as much as their faces could) or hump themselves against the buck. And of course old-fashioned masturbation still did the job if no bucks were around. <br />
<br />
Oh, and you COULD get pregnant. You wonder why that concept didn&#39;t bother you more, but this whole being a female deer in the wild felt like a load of stress off you so far. You were starting to not care whether you might become yourself again in 3 years, and if anything it might just be a casual challenge. <br />
<br />
And so time passed...</p>
