<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh, that’s right,” Professor Pascal picked up the paddle, inspecting it as if he’d found a tiny crack. “Young Magnus, you offered to take Master Daniel’s punishment.  Wasn’t that right?”  His question silenced the room, each student eyeing the quivering Magnus for his response.<br />
<br />
“Y-Y-Yes, Professor!” Magnus winced, bracing himself for a blow as Pascal effortlessly swung the paddle in his direction.  When it didn’t connect he let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
“Assume the position.” Pascal said firmly, his tone biting as hard as a strike from his paddle.<br />
<br />
Magnus grunted in confirmation, rump high, legs spread wide so to be at the right height for Professor Pascal, his massive balls hanging down to his knees, cock throbbing hard again.  The first 20 strikes had added over a foot in height and 160lbs of muscle to Magnus.  Nearly 9-feet-tall, he was starting to look as big as Patrick.<br />
<br />
“You got this, Magnus!” Dan cheered the quivering bull on from his desk, but Professor Pascal was having none of it.<br />
<br />
“Master Daniel, you’ve just doubled the punishment for poor Magnus here.”  Pascal took a warm up swing, the wind from his oversized paddle making Magnus’ platinum blond fur rustle.  “40 strikes now.”<br />
<br />
Pascal took another swing, this time connecting with a loud THWAP that echoed in the room.  Magnus’ heavily muscled body rippled from the force, swelling larger, his whimpers growing deeper.<br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...Magnus was now bigger than Patrick, reality compensating as he grew.  He had to kneel over the Professor’s desk for Pascal to be level with his massive rump...platinum blond fur in stark contrast to the bright red marks left by the paddle.<br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...10 strikes...Pascal was panting.  At 11-feet-tall, Magnus was large enough that he needed to use the paddle reserved for redheads.  Beads of sweat were forming over his brow as the Professor hefted the wooden beam with both hands.<br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...Dan gulped...Magnus was at least 12-feet-tall, and the changes to reality were becoming more dramatic.  His pile of clothes shifted from bike shorts to a kilt, the classroom expanded in size to accommodate the larger student.<br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...20 strikes...The platinum muscle bull was now the biggest person in the classroom, the lone redhead sitting against the wall was starting to look small besides Magnus’ 13-foot-tall body.<br />
<br />
Pascal set the paddle (nearly as long as he was tall) aside and shed his tweed coat before rolling up his sleeves.  His grey-silver fur matted with sweat.  Despite his heavily muscled 7-foot-tall frame, he was struggling to administer his punishment to Magnus’ much larger body.  He hefted the oversized paddle...he might have bitten off more than he could chew.  <br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...Magnus let out a powerful, deep moan as his body rippled and swelled to 14-feet-tall.  Dan could hear a few students stifling their orgasms behind him...the deep timbre of Magnus’ moans were so powerful it seemed to roll through their bodies.  The moan was so powerful, it put Patrick’s roar from the Alpha Bear competition to shame.<br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...30 strikes, Magnus’ mane was braided into an even thicker and more masculine knot...something you’d see sooner on a beast of burden like a clydesdale.  The floor was slick with pre, which was pumping from Magnus’ oversized cock like a leaking firehose.<br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...the room shimmered again, expanding from a large computer hall into a hanger that could hold men of Magnus’ size.  Dan looked around, the six students had been replaced with giant redheads.  Each one was so thick with muscle they had trouble looking past their pecs...which was a relief for Dan, he already had his hands full with Patrick and Marcus.<br />
<br />
THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP...THWAP!  Magnus roared another orgasm, hips grinding as he released several blasts of cum against the hanger floor.<br />
<br />
“Huff...40 strikes.”  Pascal fell back into his chair, his clothes soaked with sweat.  The paddle was longer than he was tall and looked like the cross-section of a fallen redwood tree.  “T-That should teach you *panting* young Magnus.”<br />
<br />
Magnus groaned, rising up...and up...from his knees.  “T-THANK YOU, PROFESSOR.”  Despite his timid tone, Magnus’ voice was deep, powerful, and BOOMED...even a couple redheads moaned in response.  <br />
<br />
Dan had to lean back to take Magnus’ new size in!  He had to be nearly 20-feet-tall, and so thick with muscle that he looked just as wide.  His oversized cock hung over his balls, resting a few feet on the floor.  His muscle gut had balooned so large and round that he couldn’t reach around anymore.  Everything about Magnus had been magnified...he was a giant, even amongst the classroom of redheads.<br />
<br />
As Magnus turned to take his seat in the front of the class, Dan noticed the butt plug had grown with the new reality...while he could only see the base, it was the size of a truck tire.<br />
<br />
Pascal patted his brow, looking firmly at Dan.  “Next time, the punishment for your property will be much worse.”<br />
<br />
“--my property?”  Dan thought to himself...when he noticed a collar had materialized around Magnus’ neck.<br />
<br />
Of course...now that Magnus was bigger than the average redhead, he could easily win the Alpha Bear competition.  Dan’s heart sank suddenly...what did that mean for Patrick and Marcus?<br />
<br />
“Thank you for allowing me to take punishment on your behalf, Master.”  Magnus did his best to whisper as the lecture finally began.  “Wait till your other slaves hear about it, they’ll be so jealous!”<br />
<br />
Dan’s eyes went wide...other slaves???  He reached for his phone to see how the world had changed to accommodate Magnus’ growth…<br />
<br />
&quot;No cell phones during class--&quot; A meaty paw swiftly grabbed Dan&#39;s phone, pocketing it as Pascal returned to his lecture. “--you can get this at the end of the day, Master Daniel.”<br />
<br />
Dan groaned into his hands...hopefully the world hadn’t changed too much.</p>
