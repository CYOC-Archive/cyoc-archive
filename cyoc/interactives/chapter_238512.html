<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody didn’t feel comfortable spending the rest of the day in the stable, not when her brother-turned-horse was chuffing about, giddily pressing against the stable door as if he was getting ready to jump over it to charge at the new unicorn.<br />
<br />
A lot of new things were happening to Cody today, but horse-incest wasn’t going one of them!<br />
<br />
Jason did look sexy, though… and his smell... that spicy scent of male stink wafting through olfactory nerves she didn’t have before – oh heavens!<br />
<br />
She seized up, broad, barreled back arching as she whimpered out a shrieking whinny. She gasped, suddenly feeling like her back end was doused with a hot bucket of water. What the hell was that?!<br />
<br />
She clopped backwards in a panic, her new equine senses spelling-out loud and clear that she had to run away from anything unknown and scary, and now was the time to book it! Her gait was uneven and harsh, even worse than a newborn filly as she stumbled her way out of the barn, feeling another gush of hot, slick mare slime swelter down her backside.<br />
<br />
“I’m pissing? Am I pissing!?” Cody arched her head back frantically to see what was going on, only to spot a tell-tale pool of pale yellow liquid flooding the ground around her hind hooves. Mare piss usually reeked to high heavens, but Cody noticed that hers smelled different, somewhat like… <br />
<br />
“Cotton Candy?” the unicorn guessed, huffing in the slightly acrid scent of flavored sugar. Cody considered herself lucky that her unicorn piss wasn’t that same fetid mare scent she’d grown used to working on the farm, because she was absolutely dripping in it! Her tail was soaking wet, making Cody wonder whether she had to manually lift her tail to piss. And her teats… those immaculate pink mounds of mare boobs were utterly drenched with her own urine. So much for being a clean and graceful creature… clearly not the best showing for a unicorn…<br />
<br />
Hooves bucked and slammed into the wooden stall inside the horse stable, Jason even more riled up by that alluring trail of piss she left behind her like a trail of breadcrumbs. A cattle prod of sheer bestial lust was tempting her to go back inside and aim that stream of mare piss right in his face, but Cody managed to see to it that her unicorn sense of decency carried her far, far away. At least… for now.<br />
<br />
She tried her best to gallop off into the nearby woods, only to stumble and clack her pearly-pink hooves into the litter of fallen tree branches and sinkholes of mud along the way. Trial by error gradually made balance neurons connect to her leg neurons, and she managed to even out her stride, totting straightaway into the old woods that Aura had called home. There’d surely be need for a unicorn here since she was on vacation.<br />
<br />
“Tens of Thousands of years old, huh…?” Cody slowed as she thought about how long Aura said she’d been tending to the forest. That must have been a lot of work on her part, but even poor Aura didn’t seem to realize that humans were encroaching in on the forest quickly. It must have just taken 40 or 50 years for all those housing developments and shopping districts to pop up around here. Sure, there were a few decorative saplings littered about the parking lots of those storefronts, but the old forest had greatly been diminished by human activity. Did Aura still consider that her forest too?<br />
<br />
As she was lost in thought, a gentle prod to the leg stopped Cody in her tracks, the unicorn peering down to see a deer faun nosing against her stomach. The realization perked up in her mind that since Aura was out, the animals would consider her the new guardian of the forest in her absence, and naturally, they’d want things from her.<br />
<br />
As she peered down at him, Dopamine suddenly just flushed into her mind like a flash-bang of sheer elation went off. She couldn’t describe why seeing this little creature made her feel so good. Was it motherly affection directed at a cute little foal-like critter? Did she just feel good seeing one of her forest-dwelling subjects? Or did she have a built-in unicorn brain circuit that made her want to please it? And furthermore… what did this animal want?<br />
<br />
She heard that fawn bleat, the animal utterances translated to speech in her mind that she could clearly understand.<br />
<br />
“Your mom weened you… and you think it was too early?” Cody repeated the fawn’s request back to the little deer, the fawn peeping out another cervine yalp in confirmation.<br />
<br />
“Oh, w-well. I’m I don’t think I can… You see, I’m sorta just looking after things around here while Aura’s on vacation, maybe you can wait to ask her?” Cody stammered out, it becoming all too clear that a unicorn on her first day of work may not be the best at giving animals advice, but it looked like the fawn was really counting on her. “Have you tried eating grass or maybe some foliage? I understand it’s not the same as milk, little guy, but someday you’ve got to learn to-”<br />
<br />
Cody’s words get stuck in the back of her long equine throat as a warmth surged right between her plump mare thighs. Those flesh-pink plush-pillows of unicorn udders that Aura gifted her felt like they were expanding like a latex glove inflating with hot water. Even her nipples were swelling, turning into the long, rubbery, tuggable sort of teats she’d see on a dairy cow! Cody shifted uncomfortably, her horn shimmering a magical blue as she tried to cast some sort of spell to relieve the pressure down there, but no dice! She pawed and kicked at the ground, grating her blocky horse teeth as she struggled to contend with that body-shaking sensation of milky build-up! She wracked her mind to think of what to do, only for the solution to come in the form of the fawn’s little tongue.<br />
<br />
“Ah! H-hey!” Cody blurt out with a terse neigh, yet the fawn didn’t seem to pay her any mind; he was getting what he wanted.<br />
<br />
“Th-that just happens now?!” Cody whickered out in surprise, “Unicorns just lactate when you want it?!”<br />
<br />
Apparently, they did, and the fawn knew it too. The unicorn mare tried to saunter forward to get away, but the little deer already had her by the tit, that small maw swallowing one of her over-sized nipples whole before those dull little teeth clamped down and started pulling.<br />
<br />
“Ahhnnn!! Slow down dammit! S-stop biting!” Cody feebly whinnied, as she was at the mercy of the fawn suckling on her. “Didn’t your mother teach you any respect!? I’m the forest guardian! Ugh – no wonder she weened you early!”<br />
<br />
Nothing she said dissuaded the fawn, not a swear or a curse from her trembling mare lips would stop Cody’s whole body from straining and tingling as she started to pant. Thick, creamy dairy squirt out of her udders at the fawn’s beck and call, milk bulging out her feral teats as that tiny mouth gobbled up that milk-swollen teat as if it were his mom’s! Cody decided he’d never talk down to one of the farm’s cows or goats again! That feeling of her supple mammaries getting played with and kneaded… that feeling of warmth and maternal desires starting to rise…<br />
<br />
Wait. Why’s it starting to feel… good? It hurt like hell just a second ago but…<br />
<br />
“Niihiiihhihii…” A sultry, whining whicker purged out any other bad things she had to say about her amazing little titty-sucker. Her teat felt raw and sensitive, pulsing with pleasure as she buckled her thighs and squeezed that medicine-ball-sized flesh-balloon in between them.<br />
<br />
“Nhhhwiwiii… Damn, that’s it…” Cody drooled out a lustful nicker, pawing her front hooves against the soft forest loam. “Don’t be shy. Bite it. Harder. Come on, baby. Bite it for momma…!”<br />
<br />
“Frroooosshh!”<br />
<br />
Cody whined as a gush of mare need splattered out her rear like a dam bursting! She remembered to lift her tail this time, that hose of steamy mare piss flinging out several feet behind her as her pussy shivered. The sensation wet heat sizzling against the opening of her pink rocked her bestial mare cunt, making it throb and wink.<br />
<br />
The fawn withdrew as piss started to leak down Cody’s udders. The unicorn mare turned around to see why he stopped, but the fawn just gave her a weird look before trotting off through a nearby thicket. His face looked perturbed, like he was glaring at someone who’d just pissed in the punchbowl. Even the dull feral face clearly asking, “What the fuck?”<br />
<br />
“No wait! Come back! You just started!” Cody shuddered, hot urine dripping down her legs as those udders sat there swollen with unrequited milk for her needy little critter. Why did she get turned on by nursing? Why did it make her piss herself like a mare in heat? “Ughhhwahh… denied by a stupid little deer…”<br />
<br />
A tinge of disappoint lit a dark, glowing ember inside him. Disappointment turned into frustration. Frustration turned into a full, aching need as that fawn’s unrequited request to nurse pulsed between her thighs, sloshing with milk!<br />
<br />
“Hey! Hey! Get back here, dammit! You’re not done!” Cody yelled out to the fawn, nervously jogging in a small circle as those bloated crotch boobs wobbled against one another. Some of that thick cream mercifully leaked out, but it wasn’t near enough to relieve the pressure building inside that taut mare udder! In fact, it was getting even worse!<br />
<br />
She couldn’t stand it anymore! She took off like a horse at the Kentucky Derby, galloping deeper into the woods as she passed countless trees, scanning around like a hawk for any little ones that might be in need of a fat, milky unicorn titty.<br />
<br />
“Any babies need milk? Anyone? Ok, juveniles? You don’t even need to drink! Just tug on my fucking horse boobs!” She cried out as she trot in place, hiking her legs high with each jittery step like a dressage horse. Cody frantically looked this way and that, at last spotting a small band of young foxes glancing her way, heading towards her.<br />
<br />
“Hi-hello-hi, little ones! Hi!!!” Cody spat out friendly greetings like machine gunfire, freezing in place as she tried her best to draw them towards her, preferably between her hindlegs! Her udders felt near to bursting, and they were still dripping with her horny piss! She quickly magicked up a few broad maple leaves from the tree above them, polishing her udders as she tried to get rid of any trace of that urine from her mammaries. She turned towards her little charges impatiently, looming over them like a stranger offering children candy.<br />
<br />
“Okay, what do you need?! Requests! Let’s hear ‘em!” She started to shake in anticipation, milk dribbling from those engorged teats. “Do I hear milk? Milk? Anyone? Milk?”<br />
<br />
There was some vulpine chatter followed by a flurry of feral yips directed her way.<br />
<br />
“No milk? Really?” Cody responded, feeling so dejected she considered high tailing it out of there to try to find someone else that’d suckle from her. But she just couldn’t leave them, that intense sense of duty bidding her to help these forest dwellers in need.<br />
<br />
“You guys are… young males just out of momma fox’s den... and you want to mate?” the unicorn translated, not really sure what sort of dating advice she could give to an animal, especially since she’d never gone out with a girl as a human before. “I mean… just find a girl fox, ask her out, be really nice to her, be yourself, and you know… maybe she’ll let you- NiiAHHGH!”<br />
<br />
It was happening again! Her tail flagging as her sweet urine shot out like a canon, staining several meters of the ground behind her! This was crazy! She felt dazed, almost losing her balance as that maregasm struck her out of nowhere like lightening! Her fat, throbbing mare clit started to press out between those curtains of swollen equine labia, that thumb-sized button of hot-pink clit oozing strands of pure need as it signaled her heat to the world.<br />
<br />
Damn it! She just developed yet another throbbing problem that she couldn’t deal with without hands! At this rate she’d need her own personal forest guardian to help her not feel horny every two minutes!<br />
<br />
As if her prayers had been answered, she gasped as she felt one of those little fox todds hop up behind her, pawing at her fat equine legs as his little tongue trained across the piss-soaked surface of her massive feral calves. A light bulb lit up at the tip of her horn, albeit a rather apprehensive one.<br />
<br />
She wished for Aura to turn her into a unicorn, not some kind of cougar! All these little animals seemed to think their forest guardian was some sort of cheap, milky mare-whore! Is this what Aura did all day when she was taking care of the forest all these years? As a human, there’d be a litany of issues that Cody could think of when it came to what she was about to do, but deep down there was a burning unicorn instinct to serve her little forest dwellers. No matter how much she hated it, she just couldn’t help it! <br />
<br />
Unable to control herself, Cody shakily flopped down on her knees, laying her huge horse belly flush to the forest floor as she flagged her tasseled tail up, a universal sign for the little fox boy to give her attention.<br />
<br />
“Please, you don’t have to mate ME, you know, right?” Cody’s breathing was so heavy she felt like she was hyperventilating. The little fox seemed all too excited as well, ears pinned back as that fluffy tail wagged so hard it looked like it was about to spin off like a helicopter blade. He had the enthusiasm but didn’t quite seem to grasp her horse anatomy. Those little paws nudged and pushed against those giant pink flaps of mare love, some errant licks dipping inside her honey pot as that little lipstick of fox dick drooled against her huge horse ass. But despite all that, he wasn’t anywhere close to striking home. It was sort of pathetic. <br />
<br />
“Uahh! Hey! If you’re not gonna do it right, don’t do it at all!” Cody nickered, arching her head back over her shoulder. “There. It’s right there. Go there. Under the tail! No, not right under the tail! A little lower!”<br />
<br />
It felt like she was trying to give instructions to a goldfish, she started to wonder how this little guy’s species wasn’t already extinct due to their lack of sexual intuition! Cody snorted out a frustrated chuff as her horn sparkled, picking the young fox todd up and mashing his groin against her rear.<br />
<br />
“There, see?! That’s it, there. Yeah, just mash your sheath against that. Just hump where it feels hot!... H-hey! N-no! Don’t jump down! Just stay on! Dig your claws into my butt if you need to!” Cody snorted as she realized that perhaps the size difference was a bit of an issue, but that wouldn’t stop her. She butted her rear back against him as her magic did all the work. She held the todd up, vibrating that sheath against her hot, gooey netherlips like an extra-small dildo. Her pussy shuddered as that tiny vulpine prick prodded her folds, copious fountains of mare urine drenching the little fox’s lower body as she desperately fought to fulfill his request.<br />
<br />
“Unnnphfff… Good. That’s it, baby… A little more…” She bit her lip, stifling a deep whinny as her magic aura gripped the base shaft of the fox’s penis, masturbating it fervently to get it to stick out. The fox seemed to be enjoying this, clawing, licking, and nipping at her fuzzy rear as she took a hoofs-on approach to satisfying him. Cody’s rump twitched as she finally felt that tiny dick invade her innards. Her clit ground against the bottom of that canine cock as her butt muscles all contracted in unison to hug it tightly inside her. She focused her magic on the todd’s cock holters to tug it back as far as it could go, revealing a golf-ball sized vulpine knot bulging just above the base.<br />
<br />
“Finally… something bigger… maybe I’ll feel it…” Cody purred as well as a unicorn could, her magic grasp cupping that that knot so tight she could already feel that pulsing bulge of kit meat raging near the bottom of the fox’s cock. Her mystical blue aura gently clutched her needy little subject’s rear, guiding him balls deep inside her velvety mare love as that curtain of labia closed around it with a wet “squelch!”.<br />
<br />
There wasn’t any hope of knotting her properly, but she could certainly feel him a lot better now. She relaxed, letting the fox do more of the work as she held him up to her horse pussy, letting that thick bulb of simmering dick grind against her winking clit. Her labial lips suckled on that knot like a cherry lollipop, slurping it in and out as the todd thrust, painting his bulge it in an off-white slime of mare love.<br />
<br />
Despite how wrong it was, it felt pretty nice servicing that tiny morsel of a penis. Sure it wasn’t a huge, honking horse dong like her brother had, but it did the job. Even if it was sort of a hot-dog-down the hallway situation, lustful whinnies and moans started to seep out her panting maw. Her cunt treated him just like she would a stallion, squirting out more steaming hot queefs of mare cum all over his fun-sized wiener as he spanked his groin against her swollen marehood.<br />
<br />
But what was really getting her off wasn’t the dick itself, but fulfilling the fox’s need! Hearing him yip and pant as he ferociously dug that little vulpine prick inside her like there was no tomorrow made her fat udders squish between her thighs, her body shuddering as she felt his pre smear down to her mare tits! Cody figured this must be what it’s like to take a kid to a park, watching them have a ton of fun while you just bask in the warmth of their happiness. Yet as she listened to that constant rhythm of flesh dragging against wet, sloppy sex from behind, she didn’t see the second kit approaching from the front.<br />
<br />
“Huh? Waiting for your turn too, little guy?” the unicorn puffed out a playful snort in the fox’s face, as if reassuring him he was next in line for her rear end. However, he seemed much more interested in her front.<br />
<br />
Without uttering a single yip, he leapt on her broad equine muzzle, her nose smooshed against the underbelly of the todd’s tummy as he mashed his sheath right up against her mouth. This one seemed more forceful than the other, his paws gripping the underside of her muzzle possessively, humping his cock holster against her thick, rubbery unicorn lips as he clenched his teeth and growled. That first smidge of reddish fox pride slinked out, smearing his acrid boyish spice against her fat rubbery mare lips.<br />
<br />
Cody instinctively knew exactly what to do. He relished it, cherished it even. Her huge lips drooled out a cups-worth of thick horse saliva onto the fox’s cock before accepting him inside, forcefully making wet, sloppy slurping sounds as if she were trying to simulate her pussy for him. She kneaded that cock in her lips, hugging it tight as she pushed her snout forward, managing to swallow most of it inside the warm confines of her maw. Cody let that hot, inch-thick unicorn tongue blanket the tip of the todd’s cock, lavishing it with thick, doting licks as she felt her little charge start to hump her harder, his balls beating against her muzzle as they started to chug and churn.<br />
<br />
“Niihiiihihii-“ She whickered with a hefty, pleasured snort. Her horn seemed to act with a mind of its own, clutching both fox’s bottoms as she pressed a magical finger right up inside their tight little todd rumps! Both jolted, crying out in high-pitched yips of pleasure as their asses clenched around Cody’s mystic aura that pushed up inside their asses like a little magical dildos. She felt those tiny flesh-bags of prostate smoosh against her grasp, their tails whipping as their hips thrashed. Both of those tiny todds were pushed to the brink, raging against her at the apex of sexual bliss!<br />
<br />
The duo howled as they mashed their knots as deep as they would go with one last battering-ram-like smack. Their balls released sperm like an uncorked bottle of Champagne as the pair spit-roasted their giant equine partner. Cody was more than prepared for it, lapping up all that hot, salty, copper-flavored puppy batter, holding their butts in place with her magic as her body drank from their bestial boyhoods. They whimpered in bliss, their strong little grips on Cody’s frame slowly growing tenuous as they fought for their lives to stay inside her, trying to shoot more cum inside their surrogate mom. It was short lived though, the pair eventually growing limp and falling out, collapsing to the forest floor, utterly beat as if they’d just ran a marathon!<br />
<br />
With a playful flick of her tail, Cody nickered out a giggle, feeling loose strands of fox spunk ooze out her lips and her nether lips, that maternal need to mate and service her little darlings sated. At least… almost sated.<br />
<br />
She peered over to that other fox still watching from the sidelines, that tip of his red rocket starting to show as she turned her attention towards him. He had a request for her too, and she think she knew just what it was.<br />
<br />
“Go on, hun. I’m more than ready to give more pony rides!” She whickered teasingly, flicking her tail as she flung a musky cocktail of mare juice and fox cum in his direction. “That’s what you want, right? Just get in line, I’m free, you know!”<br />
<br />
This fox looked rather nervous, approaching her from the front, looking fearfully up at her like he was about to have a face-to-face chat with an alligator.<br />
<br />
“No need to worry, baby!” Cody said with a horsey-smirk. “If BJ’s are your thing, front door’s open too-!”<br />
<br />
The fox shook his head, yipping out a correction in his animal tongue, the unicorn tilting her head as she tried to understand.<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Her voice sounded slightly disappointed, she was really hoping for some sloppy seconds, but he seemed like he was after something else. “A mate? What do you mean? I can do that, I can mate with you. Didn’t you see me blow these two’s minds? Come on. Just stick your dick in me. Any hole. You choose.”<br />
<br />
The little fox averted his gaze as Cody swished her massive like some girls her saw twerking on TikTok. His eyes drifted away from her as if he lost faith, as if he didn’t think she could help him. He turned, starting to walk away sad.<br />
<br />
That felt bad to the unicorn. Really bad. Like, the opposite of an orgasm, even! Cody couldn’t take that lightly, it was an afront to his position of forest guardian! The unicorn shot back up to four legs, jumping into the todd’s escape route as the critter tried to trot away.<br />
<br />
“Hey, wait!” She whinnied out shrilly, desperation for validation wild in her eyes. “I knew what you mean! I was just joking. I’ll do whatever you want! Anything!” Even filtered through a series of neighs, the unicorn’s voice sounded frantic. “You want a mate. Not like a one-and-done thing. Like an actual bona fide vixen you can pump pups into, right?”<br />
<br />
The fox looked up and nodded, starring into her deep equine eyes expectantly.<br />
<br />
“Well!” Cody snorted, feeling that pride return as the todd’s trust in her was restored. “Well… umm…”<br />
<br />
That was a little more difficult. This whole “being a unicorn” job was pretty easy when all she had to do was bend over and let little animals rail her, but this took a little more thought.<br />
<br />
“Ughh…” Cody anxiously stepped back, her eyes peering upwards as the nearly-virgin unicorn tried to formulate dating advice. “I mean… just find a vixen and… and …be yourself…?”<br />
<br />
That wasn’t working, a tinge of despair sent crusty prickles of pain through her horn, signaling she was losing the todd’s interest again. Wait, the horn? Maybe the horn could help…<br />
<br />
The unicorn concentrated that hope and despair seeping inside her and sent it through her horn. She shot out a blue flair of twinkling magic into the sky, the spark exploding like a firework as it rained down embers of her consciousness all over the forest where she held dominion. <br />
<br />
Cody had surprised even herself. She didn’t know she could do that, but all of a sudden she seemed to see every creature in in the vicinity. Her mind filled with an encyclopedia of every little rabbit in their burrow, every owl perched up in high in forest’s canopy, and everything else in between. She focused, trying to get a census on all the vixens out there in need of a fellow fox to dick them, but she was coming up empty.<br />
<br />
“Gee, sorry kid. It looks like all the vixens have got litters of their own. Come to think of it, it’s not even mating season for you guys, isn’t it?” Cody mentioned, figuring that had to be the todd’s problem. “Yeah, that’s got to be it. You can’t really expect to find a female in heat this time of year, they’re mostly raising their own kits right now. I don’t think they want to mate.”<br />
<br />
That seemed to be a solution, albeit not one the todd was happy with. The little fox wasn’t fulfilled, and that throbbing need to help buried inside Cody’s unicorn soul wasn’t sated either! She thought about it, opening the weird arcane knowledge locked in the dark catacombs of her unicorn instincts. She stood there in a trance as she used magic to scan her own mind, eyes glazing over into white-orbs until she finally uncovered something that might help.<br />
<br />
“Ah. There’s something that could work…” She murmured, catching the todd’s attention. “Most animals are anchored to in both body and spirit. The meant they’re intransmutable: you can’t really use magic to change them at all – not their bodies or their heat cycles. But there are some animals that are malleable… some so malleable that I think we’ve got our new vixen…”<br />
<br />
Cody’s irises came back into view, her head arching back around her, starring off into the woods. “And I sense someone that’s malleable, they’re very close!”<br />
<br />
That magical census she cast told her exactly where that magically malleable creature was but didn’t seem to tell her what it was. That didn’t matter. All that mattered was that welling of pride shooting satisfaction straight into her brain like a hyper-addictive drug. The fox trot beside her with a happy little sway in his step, Cody unreasonably blissful that she was about to make the todd happy too!<br />
<br />
As they went along, the forest abruptly grew sparse, the canopy giving way to professionally quapped lawn or freshly mowed grass. The fox looked apprehensive spotting the strange, unnatural structure that he knew was a human’s dwelling. Cody didn’t stop though. She nudged him alongside her, the pair cautiously stepping around the periphery of the forest as her horn zeroed in on the malleable targets she was sensing.<br />
<br />
“Sarah, it’s probably not a good idea to wear that…” A male voice spoke from the house’s driveway, Cody spotting two humans sharing some rather heated words.<br />
<br />
“Oh, so you’re telling me what to wear now?” A female voice spat with a certain venom to it.<br />
<br />
The fox ducked into the brush as he sensed conflict just by the sound of their voices. Cody peered at the two, able to tell that one was male and the other female… but she didn’t seem to quite process their human language very well. They were talking too fast and she only vaguely understood what they were talking about as she heard the tone and intensity of their conversation while catching a few intelligible words here and there.<br />
<br />
Even weirder still, she seemed to forget how to tell their genders apart. Even though she was human just this morning, she couldn’t decern boy from girl now, her unicorn mind just unable to read their gender by looking at them.<br />
<br />
“I go to a Catholic school! My prom’s at that school!” The male voice explained, clearly fearful of the female’s reaction. “The chaperones are Catholics too and they expect dresses to be below the knee with no cleavage showing.”<br />
<br />
“You never told me that!” The female voice shot back indignantly. “I had to rent this dress you know!? Do you think I can just put something together on the fly!? Just… just…!”<br />
<br />
One of the humans stomped away back inside the house while the other hung their head down, seeming quite upset with the outcome of that conversation.<br />
<br />
Cody figured that was good! At least… it was in a way. From what she could interpret, they must really hate each other, so one of them should be open to dating her little vulpine bachelor here!<br />
<br />
She took a step out of the cover of the trees, rustling the brush underneath her hooves as the human’s attention shot in her direction. The biped went white as if he’d seen a ghost, the human slinking a shaky step backward as Cody’s whole unicorn body came into view.<br />
<br />
“No way…” He said, gawking at Cody from a safe distance. “You can’t be… a unicorn? This is like some sorta joke, right?”<br />
<br />
Oh. He could see unicorns! That meant he’s a virgin!<br />
<br />
Cody snickered out a giggling whicker, realizing the human was really about to have the time of his life! She searched the deep mystic tomes sitting innate her unicorn mind, her horn beginning to thrum, giving off that faint blue glow.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit. You are real…” The human boy murmured, still petrified with awe at the mystical creature paying him a house visit. “My phone! Everyone’s gotta see this! Its horn is even getting all magic-y now!”<br />
<br />
The boy’s hand dove down to his waist, quick drawing his phone from his pocket. He held it up, swiping open his camera from his lock screen, pressing his thumb to the fingerprint scanner to unlock it and…<br />
<br />
Denied.<br />
<br />
Probably a bad angle. He tried again. Denied.  Again. Denied.<br />
<br />
The human boy grit his teeth, starring at the magical horse standing right there in front of him, thinking about all the social media clout he was about to miss out on just because his stupid phone was on the fritz! He pressed it again and again and again. Until his phone just slipped out of his hand!<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” He cursed, praying to God that his screen didn’t break after his phone toppled down to the grass. He toppled onto his hand and knees, frustration growing as he tried to grasp his phone to pick it back up – once, twice, three times.<br />
<br />
“Crriick!”<br />
<br />
He paused. For a moment the boy worried he’d accidentally smashed his phone’s screen trying to pick it up, but it was much worse.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t stand up! It was like he broke his back, yet it only elicited a short prick of pain from his spine. He looked behind him hoping his girlfriend could help him, but she hadn’t come out of the house yet. He tried again for his phone, trying to scoop it up in his hand instead of grabbing it from the back so he could dial 911, but it fell out of his grasp immediately, revealing…<br />
<br />
“A paw!?” The boy’s eyes burrowed into his skull in sheer fright. His hands... both his hands lacked discernable fingers, looking just like the leathery pads of a dog’s paw! A bright, creamy fuzz seeped through the in betweens of his canine digits as the tickly feeling of a growing fur coat roiled up underneath the sleaves of his dress shirt, spreading an uncomfortably sensuous heat pulsing up onto his torso.<br />
<br />
He started to hyperventilate. No, he was panting, his tongue lolling out as it began to stretch, growing thinner and longer as thick frothy drool dripped from his lips and sharpening teeth! That over-lengthened tongue of his was suddenly enveloped back into his mouth as his nose came into his field of vision, merging with his mouth into a proper vulpine muzzle.<br />
<br />
“It’s safe, buddy!” Cody hummed happily to the todd hidden behind the brush, the critter popping into view as the two sauntered up towards the changing boy. Cody marveled at her own handiwork, surprised at how easy the transformation spell to cast! It wasn’t a continuous effort on her part to change him. No, all she did was cast a spark of a spell as if she were lighting a candlewick. She had magic’d the boy in his hands, and yet the spell was burning through his human form, leaving nothing but fox in its wake!<br />
<br />
“Here, let me help!” the unicorn snickered playfully, her magic tugging the back of the boys shirt and pants before suddenly snipping it. His entire prom outfit fell asunder, sleeves and pantlegs drooping down to the ground. As the flares of transformation magic finally touched those cut up clothes, they burned into nothing. Shoes, socks, underwear – they all immolated in an aura of blue flame, agreeing with the unicorn that the new animal wouldn’t need those cloths anyway! Replacing those clothes was that wildfire of orange fox fuzz that sizzled all along his shifting body.<br />
<br />
And sizzling was an understatement! His changing body was literally steaming, whimpers and harsh shudders slipping out of that newly extended vulpine snout as his bones crackled and creaked like dull embers in a bonfire. Newly snipped ligaments and muscles brought about brand-new insertion points, his physical structure becoming decidedly alien to his old body as his arms and legs grew into digitigrade fox legs.<br />
<br />
The boy tried to slink away, only to come face to face with his predestined fox lover. Like a newlywed couple, the todd’s thick slimy fox tongue lulled out and delivered a sloppy kiss to the boy’s vulpine muzzle. The boy’s eyes watered as he tried to fight it, unable to turn as that tongue slunk into his mouth, drenching his maw in fox spit as his torso seemed to deflate. That transformation magic seemed to be burning away all that excess weight into a steamy sweat that billowed away into the air.<br />
<br />
That sweat made everything start to feel humid, the smell cloying at the boy’s new fox nose. At first it smelled like him, like B.O. and body spray, but that human stink shifted into a heady vulpine perfume, the taste almost choking him as that prying, aromatic stink lashed against his mind relentlessly.<br />
<br />
His body was mostly gone now, the boy’s physique reduced to the size of a dog’s as he stood their eye level with the amorous fox todd. All attempts to push the fox he was making out with away failed miserably as he found himself suckling on that long tongue of his obnoxious little lover, milking that male, bestial scent off it as sheer lust drooled into his brain.<br />
<br />
As the boy’s body shrunk, his spine didn’t to at the same rate. A vestigial nub of bone peeked out of the boy’s rear, stretching the skin as thick waves of fur piled on it making it look like a super-extended paint brush tip.<br />
<br />
Just as the boy was getting into that bestial make-out session, a whisp of blue magic picked up the todd, drifting him through the air until he was muzzle-to-ass with the newly changed boy. By now, the boy had been shifted into an animal beyond recognition, little of his human self remained save for a that sad little penis of his.<br />
<br />
The fox behind him immediately gave his new mate a canine-greeting, shoving his nose right underneath that tail so hard the former-boy felt that nose sink right inside his anus! Those lips lapped and chewed, tenderizing that vestigial humanoid pucker into a tight little fox hole for him to play with. The new animal writhed and would have sprint away from all those weird sensations if it wasn’t for Cody’s magic surrounding him, holding him in place.<br />
<br />
Turning his attention lower towards that remaining human stink clinging to his new mate, the todd’s tongue lapping up the new fox’s fleshy boy penis, kneading it between his lips. He gently grazed that swollen cock-tip with his canine teeth as the new fox feebly whined and struggled to get away. Little spurts of human cum sprayed into the fox’s maw as the former boy’s cock shrunk, practically melting in his the todd’s mouth like ice. The new fox’s balls followed suit, those two orbs getting painted with the todd’s drool as they shrunk down, deflating with every spurt of cum until they were the size of Tik-Taks! The scrotal sacks smooshed tightly against the new fox’s perineum just below his anus, the todd forcing the former-boy’s penis tight against that spot, mashing it against him with his tongue.<br />
<br />
The new fox’s tail whipped around, trying his best to clamp it down to lock his private away from that voracious suitor, but he just couldn’t manage it! The sensations were terrifying, pleasure sparking in places that he’d never felt before, his maleness getting smaller and smaller, shortening until it was just an acorn against the todd’s tongue. The fox bacherlor’s licker squished that remaining nub of human cock against the former boy’s body, planting it in a newly formed hole that opened just below his anus.<br />
<br />
The former-boy yowled, tongue lolling out is his eyes dart open and pupils narrowed into pinpricks. Sensation piled up and sensation, the hairs all over his body straining on edge as that drooly tongue behind him dove in deep, teasing that shrinking cock-tip inside her new pussy!<br />
<br />
The vixen was about to explode like a stick of dynamite! She would have shot into the sky if Cody wasn’t holding her down! Her insides grew fleshy and pink, that human cock moistening as it fused with the lower section of her vagina, forming a throbbing, sensitive clit.<br />
<br />
The todd licked inside as her labial lips that used to form the base of her scrotum flooded with heat, swelling into a thick tri-fold canine spade as the skin grew into a dusty black. Slimy, acrid female juice squelched out of her like a gooey slurry, the todd’s tongue lewdly sloshing inside her, kissing her vulpine birth canal until he suddenly pulled way, leaving her quivering and empty!<br />
<br />
Just as the vixen was going to beg for something, someone to deal with that burning need flaring up between her legs, the todd tackled her, knocking the breath out of her lungs as a thick rod of fiery fox cock broke into that quivering vixen girlhood. Her tail was pinned back, the air drowning the two in the reeking stench of vixen cum and piss as that battering ram of fox pride burrowed inside her changing innards. As the todd hammered away at her plush rear, his dick glazed her smooth inner walls with precum, spreading her birth canal wider and wider as ovaries grew and a womb inflated inside her belly. Everything felt so full now, her body buzzing with warmth as it changing irrevocably to birth fox kits. The todd’s tapered cock tip slammed away at the stubborn to her cervix, his hot prick branding her womb with his burning hot need until finally, he burst!<br />
<br />
The unicorn’s muzzle flicked up an equine smirk as the two lovers were connected, the boy she’d seen just minutes before reduced to a gasping vixen, her hide wet as she arched her back, slamming her rear back against her mate’s cock to tie the knot once and for all!<br />
<br />
Unlike Cody’s mare pussy, the todd’s knot was a gargantuan obstacle for the new vixen. That baseball sized slab of crimson red dick meat nearly flayed the little vixen’s fox cookie as that cock audaciously speared inside her. That black cunt stretched and stretched, bestial skin growing taut to the point of tearing until one last ram of the todd’s hips audibly “popped” that matrimonial lock tightly inside her.<br />
<br />
The pair were now intertwined, fox seed spilling out the former boy’s quivering pussy lips as she whined and moaned, eyes clenched shut as her whole body arched and stretched to meet the todd’s thrusts. Cody knew by instinct they’d be tied for over an hour, so in a whisp of blue magic, she teleported them right back where she found the fox originally, letting them mate undisturbed so they could add to the multitudes of little forest dwellers that the unicorn loved so much!<br />
<br />
As Cody turned back towards the forest, she heard to the garage door bang and saw the girl run out into the driveway. She seemed frazzled, as if she’d seen or heard her transforming boyfriend, and rushed out to see if he was okay! Her prom makeup was runny, and her hair was now a tangled mess. She walked over in Cody’s direction, spotting her boyfriend’s phone and some blue embers of his disintegrated cloths, looking down frightfully… not sure if what she saw through her bedroom window was real.<br />
<br />
Cody took pity on her. This girl was within her forest’s domain after all, so technically, she was one of the unicorn’s subjects too. She didn’t see Cody, indicating that she wasn’t a virgin. With a desperate look in her eyes, she wandered aimlessly around her parent’s front lawn, seemingly needy for… something… A new relationship maybe?<br />
<br />
It seemed fair that Cody would hook her up after seizing her old boyfriend… and a few ideas did come to mind. In a flash of radiant blue light, the pair disappeared, leaving little trace of the two prom-goers except for the boy’s phone and car that lay abandoned on the house’s driveway.</p>

What does Cody do with the single girl?</h3>
