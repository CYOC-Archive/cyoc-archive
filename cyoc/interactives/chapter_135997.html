<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seated at the restaurant and looking over the menu, Eric was quite impressed by his surroundings. There was a lot of the feel for it that came off as rather rustic, which he supposed a fair number of the buildings in Moon Lake also did, but at the same time, it was also extraordinarily maintained. The wood was properly stained and polished and as he rested his arms against the table he could also tell that it had been sanded smooth before any staining and polishing was done. And the atmosphere that went through the dining area was also quite comfortable with much of the small talk that went on around being friendly and rather common place conversation.<br />
<br />
Though since it wasn&#39;t under water, Eric also found that his hearing wasn&#39;t all that much improved from before his transformation into a weremer. It was one of those things that actually made him wonder on the differences between weres and how all their senses were affected. He&#39;d noted that after they became weres, his parents and older brother could all hear and smell things much better. In fact the clue that lead to his parents finding out that Nate was gay was that they&#39;d caught the scent of sex on him. Eric had noted a few of those changes too, particularly with his eyesight and sense of smell, but nearly all of them were pretty &quot;water centric.&quot;<br />
<br />
In some sense, it&#39;d make sense, as a weremer, which was an aquatic were species. But then, from things that Julie had told him that weres were humans with some extra abilities, he&#39;d figured that those senses would be enhanced all around, regardless of whether or not he was under water. Yet, he&#39;d noted most that when outside of water that the enhancing of his senses was at best only marginal. The fact that he couldn&#39;t pick up much out of the background noise combined with the fact that many of the people they&#39;d passed carried a fairly specific were scent that Eric could notice, even if he didn&#39;t recognize the were-species, and yet he couldn&#39;t pick out all that much when compared to what he knew his parents and older brother could hear or smell.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you two think?&quot; Eric heard Martin Stovall&#39;s voice from across from him.<br />
<br />
He looked up to see him and his wife, Melissa, still seated there and both with warm smiles on their faces. For the moment, their menus were folded up and set on the tabletop with their arms on top of them. That got Eric to glance over to Julie, as he remembered the occasion. It was to celebrate Melissa&#39;s pregnancy and the expansion of the Stovall family by one.  He and Julie were invited along as well, and being able to see Julie sitting there with a smile, her blonde hair framing her face, her blue eyes glistening in the light. It also served to remind him of the supposed prophecy dreams that he and Julie had been sharing of their own future family. It was something that sat in the back of his mind and made him daydream as he looked to Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Eric said almost absentmindedly as he looked to Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that is nice to hear... but I was thinking about dinner,&quot; Martin gave a chuckle, &quot;what were you thinking of having? The kitchen here is a bit bigger than the Local Diner back in Moon Lake and they do serve some things that Moon Lake doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s a good opportunity to try something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked again at the menu and at the soda that was on a coaster in front of him. The menu was extensive with things that were offered were fairly new, or at least new to Eric. There was an extensive seafood list. Most of it was tied to many of the fisheries and fishing fleets in the Pacific Ocean, which was intriguing as he glanced through it. He was still looking through it when he heard Julie speak up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... I was thinking on their chicken fried steak,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;some of the ingredients they mention in the menu are a bit different from what the Local Diner&#39;s menu has... so... I&#39;m a bit curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite having his own menu in front of him, that made him lean to his side to look at the specific page that Julie was reading from. The only thing that went through his mind was his first date with Julie. They&#39;d had the same meal at the Local Diner and Julie had told him that while a lot of weremers did enjoy seafood, it wasn&#39;t the favorite for all of him. It brought back the happy thoughts of his first romantic kiss with her. He didn&#39;t notice it, but his lips pulled back into a rather happy smile at the memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll have the same,&quot; Eric spoke, to which Julie also happily smiled.<br />
<br />
Both Martin and Melissa smiled to each other for a moment, noticing the happiness and joy that both Eric and Julie showed. It was something that they both took pride in, particularly as fellow weremers with the mentality that seeing Eric and Julie happy together was a reminder of their own happiness that they shared. It served to also remind them of the joy that would soon arrive when Melissa gave birth in nine month&#39;s time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;re all ready,&quot; Melissa said softly to Martin with a smile, &quot;For dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded, though they would have to wait until Pierre returned to take their orders. The group made some small talk as they did so, with some questions on school and offers to help when Melissa&#39;s pregnancy advanced. It was quiet and relatively peaceful, though after a few moments, Pierre did return, carrying a small notepad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we ready to order?&quot; Pierre asked, noting that all the menus lay flat on the top of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe we are,&quot; Martin looked up to him with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ll have the grilled salmon with a baked potato and fruit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pierre nodded and looked on to Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will have your shrimp scampi and rice with fruit,&quot; Melissa stated, while reaching with her free hand to hold Martin&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;For you, Mrs. Stovall, and with your new little one on the way, I will see that your meal is the finest possible and with larger portion,&quot; Pierre spoke with a smile, &quot;so that you remain healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Melissa returned the smile and squeezed Martin&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Eric and Julie sat by and waited quietly as Martin and Melissa gave their orders. Eric noted that they&#39;d both ordered seafood/fish, but not the same dish. It wasn&#39;t a bad thing, even if it was different from the fact that he and Julie were having the same meal they&#39;d had on their first formal date, which still seemed to be not so long ago. It was quite possible that that there was some personal importance to Martin Melissa in what they ordered, but it wasn&#39;t Eric&#39;s business to ask that. He simply looked to Julie who passed her menu to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for you, Miss Julie?&quot; Pierre asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric and I will have your chicken fried steak,&quot; Julie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;One plate for both of you?&quot; Pierre wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, one plate for me and one plate for Julie,&quot; Eric spoke, &quot;we simply want the same meal... It&#39;s sort of like our first date. We had the same thing then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be something special,&quot; Pierre smiled and wrote down the order and then wrote down times two as well. <br />
<br />
Before he left, he made sure to get Eric and Julie&#39;s side dishes, and he did note that both young weremers selected the same sides. He did however couldn&#39;t help but smile at the young couple. The visit might be for Melissa Stovall&#39;s pregnancy, but he also couldn&#39;t help but note the happiness that he could see that the two teenagers had in each other.</p>
