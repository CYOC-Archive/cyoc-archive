<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff skimmed the options on the menu. There were tons of options! Jeff finally settled on the option for a dirty plaid shirt with the sleeves cut off. He thought that was a good option! He clicked through the menu. He checked the &quot;AWARE&quot; box to &quot;Yes&quot;, and set reality to not change. He clicked enter and the Chronivac prompted Jeff to remove all of his clothes. <br />
<br />
Naked, Jeff looked down at his unimpressive and embarrassing body. He took a deep breathe and clicked the transform button.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a dull heat all over his body. The first thing he noticed was that he was getting taller! It felt awesome, like someone was very slowly pulling and elongating his body and muscles! &quot;Cool!&quot; Jeff exclaimed. He ran to the mirror in his bathroom. The bathroom sink did seem a bit lower. He seemed to be about 6 feet 2 inches. He tapered off and stopped growing upwards.<br />
<br />
Jeff the felt a dull heat in his muscles, his biceps and pecs especially. He went wide eyed as he saw his skinny weak biceps slowly expanding, getting bigger and bigger! They slowly bulked up and became defined. Likewise, Jeff saw that his pecs were also expanding very slowly, becoming bigger and bigger. Jeff&#39;s nipples hardened as he felt his chest bulk up. Jeff&#39;s arms got bigger and bigger, with veins racing down his biceps and forearms. &quot;YES!&quot;, he exclaimed, flexing his now above average biceps! His stomach cramped up as he saw his stomach bump up with some hard abs. Jeff also felt his shoulders expand, slowly pulling apart. When this was finished, Jeff was built like a fireplug! His shoulders were very broad and he had substantial amounts of upper body muscles!<br />
<br />
Next, the heat went to his legs. He saw his feet expanding slowly but surely. They ballooned to size 13, and his legs and thighs slowly bulked up with muscles as well. Jeff couldn&#39;t believe it. He was getting huge. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is UNREAL!&quot;, he exclaimed, with his boyish voice cracking badly on the last word. &quot;What&#39;s up WITH my VOICE!&quot;, he asked himself, still cracking badly. Jeff then felt like something was caught in his throat and pushing outwards. His hands flew up to his neck just in time to feel a huge adams apple pushing out of his neck. &quot;WHOA!&quot;, he exclaimed, a bit deeper. The adams apple finally stopped growing, leaving him with a very prominent adams apple. His enlarged larynx had ended his boyish timbre, leaving him with a deep rough masculine voice permanently. &quot;My voice is so deep!&quot;, he rumbled. &quot;Now no one will mistake me for a woman on the phone!&quot;.<br />
<br />
the next area Jeff felt the now familiar dull heat was in his crotch. He looked at his pathetic member and smiled, knowing what was coming. A wave of pleasure washed over him as his penis began to elongate! It felt like warm hands were very slowly pulling it longer and longer. It grew longer and longer, but it also grew in thickness and girth as well. Likewise, his balls were growing larger, hanging lower in their sac. Jeff became aroused by the feeling. Within seconds he had a huge erection protruding from his body. &quot;Whoa! It had to be about 10 inches long now!&quot; And my balls! They are huge! And they hang so low. Oh man, they are so weighty and heavy!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jeff was examaning his groin, he felt a different sensaton; he began to itch all over his body! One of Jeff&#39;s hands started scrating his groin furiously and his other one started scratching one of his armpits. Jeff looked astonished when he was why he was itchy; He saw thick dark brown hairs sprouting out, all over his groin. &quot;Whoa, I&#39;m getting all hairy!&quot;, he exclaimed. Within seconds, his new pubic hair had covered his whole groin in a ridiculously thick tuft of thick brown hair. It curled together creating quite a hairy mess!<br />
<br />
Jeff took his eyes away from his groin when he noticed he was still furiously scratching one of his armpits. He lifted up his arm and saw little brown hairs poke out. Jeff was excited, as he had never had pit hair before! The tiny brown bush quickly erupted into a huge messy bush of hair. Jeff kept itching the massive bush roughly; it was so itchy! As his fingers raked through the hair, he was shocked at how thick and how much hair he now had residing under his arms. The itching finally subsided when Jeff had huge messy bushes under each arm. They stuck out even when his huge muscular arms were resting at his sides. <br />
<br />
Jeff then felt his whole torso, front and back begin to itch. As he scratched his chest, he felt and saw thick brown hairs spruting. They started below his navel and around his nipples first, but within seconds, he had a veritable tuft of hair all over his belly and chest. It joined his pubes on the bottom and went all the way to the base of his neck, completely unbroken. &quot;Oh man, I&#39;m getting so hairy! Maybe too hairy!&quot;. Then Jeff noticed his arms, legs, butt, and back begin itching all at once. Jeff grimaced as he saw hair coming out on his shoulders and his back. Gross! He didn&#39;t want back hair! His back and shoulders were imilarly covered, so not to the same extent, as his chest. As Jeff began to scratch his butt, he noticed his veiny forearms were totally covered in a thick layer of brown hair! He even had hairs on his knuckles now!<br />
<br />
As he scratched his butt, Jeff groaned as he noticed how hairy it had become. His ass was a total forest of hair now! Nasty.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down and saw his muscular legs now had a thick coating of hair as well. The hair continued onto the tops of his feet and toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m so hairy. This is too much&quot;, Jeff muttered to himself in his deep rumbling voice. Just then the Chronivac beeped; &quot;PHASE TWO BEGINNING&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw boxers materialize on his massive frame. He realized they were old, well worn, and dirty. They had very obvious cumstains and skin marks on them. He noticed they smelled a bit funky too. &quot;Oh, thats nasty!&quot;, Jeff said aloud. As soon as the boxers were on his body, he felt his groin tingle. With a sniff in the air, he noticed his groin now started to absolutely reek. It smelled like really nasty unwashed balls and ass. Jeff cringed as he let out a huge fart uncontrollably, as well. &quot;Oh man, I stink now!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Next, a pair of jeans materialized on his hairy legs. They were coveredd in mud and other stains. They smelled a bit musky as well. The jeans barely hid his package, which bulged obscenely. Then, socks that were full of holes appeared on his feet. Jeff just had time to register that his feet now produced some rank odors before a dirty pair of work boots materialized on his feet, insulating the smell, for now at least. A big belt buckle with the southern pride flag on it appeared. Lastly, a dirty smelly plaid shirt appeared on Jeff&#39;s upper body. The sleeves were torn off, clearly exposing Jeff&#39;s hairy armpits and muscles for all to see. Jeff felt his body plump up a bit. He was still muscular, but they were now hidden under a soft padded layer. Jeff felt himself begin to sweat a bit. He sniffed the air and noticed a really bad scent. He lifted up his arm and noticed it was coming from his tufts of pit hair. &quot;Aww man, looks like I make my own body odor now!&quot;, Jeff glumly thought. <br />
<br />
Lastly, a dirty baseball cap with the southern flag on it appeared on his head. He felt thick brown stubble push out of his cheeks and neck. It stopped growing after a few seconds. It left him with a scruffy unkempt short beard; as if he hadn&#39;t shaved in a week!<br />
<br />
The chronivac beeped to indicate it was done. &quot;Whoa! The machine done turt me into a hairy summabitch redneck!&quot;, Jeff grumbled. His eyes went wide with surprise; he now had a very thick southern accent!<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe all the changes that had happened; he was shocked at his size and how hairy and stinky he now was. He cupped his massive bulge with his hairy paws through his jeans. Damn, he was horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should I do?&quot;, Jeff thought to himself.</p>
