<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly the Boss now made his way towards Morgan&#39;s quarters. What he had anticipated had happened, Evan had gone rogue and destroyed himself.<br />
<br />
If the Boss was being honest, he was indifferent to Evans demise. Yes, the boy was powerful but he was a loose cannon. It didn&#39;t matter that he had saved him in the past. The Boss was concerned only with those willing to fall in line and follow orders, something Evan was sorely lacking. Now though, he had a back up plan, Morgan Carlson.<br />
<br />
Opening the door to Morgan&#39;s room, he could see the lycan sorceress weeping. It had only been an hour since she found out Evan had run off, the Normal instituting their counter measures to keep her from following. Despondent she had returned to her room, where she immediately burst into tears. &quot;Morgan,&quot; the Boss asked.<br />
<br />
Morgan now turned, her face streaked with tears as she anxiously awaited news. The Boss hiding a smirk under his hood as he now tried to seem sorrowful. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Morgan,&quot; he said softly. <br />
<br />
Morgan now wailed, her beloved nephew struck down. Despite her best efforts she was unable to save him. &quot;How?&quot; <br />
<br />
The Boss now approached a monitor, removing from his robes the digital recording of Evans fight. Always thinking ahead, he had sent a nano drone to record Evans ill advised fight against the Catalyst. Now he would show Morgan what had become of her nephew.<br />
<br />
As the video played, Morgan was silent, the sorceress&#39;s eyes trained on the video of Evans final moments. She now watched as Darren obliterated his body with one final spell before cutting to black. &quot;It was the Catalyst,&quot; he said softly. &quot;He was the one that killed Evan.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss now watched in anticipation, waiting for Morgans reaction. It didn&#39;t take him long for Morgan to do what he had wanted since reviving the lycan sorceress.<br />
<br />
Morgan&#39;s hair began to darken, turning from the blonde she had since her birth to the black it had once been. The Boss now smiling as he watched her ears begin to change becoming pointed like that of an elf. Finally he could see her eyes begin to darken, the blue iris becoming a midnight black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan now screamed, the pulse of magic now knocking the Boss off his feet. Dazed he now gazed up at an enraged Morgan, shocked as the sorceress grunted in rage. &quot;Morgan,&quot; he asked once more.<br />
<br />
Morgan snarled, the Boss watching as metallic flakes now began to float from her body. The Boss at first confused before realizing she was burning away the control measures he had painstaking installed. Morgan now flew at him, grasping him by the throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its Morgan Lefay,&quot; she snarled before tossing him into a wall. Stunned he now sat before her, feeling an emotion he so rarely felt. Fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan Carlson is gone,&quot; she stated. &quot;This Catalyst, your...organization. None of you pose a threat to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the Boss stammered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Destroying you isn&#39;t worth my time,&quot; she scoffed. &quot;Do as you will. This...Catalyst, this child that has taken Evan from me. I shall make him suffer.&quot; The Boss now felt a tremendous amount of energy enter the room, Morgan ripping open a portal as she looked to leave. Slowly she now turned to the Boss, warning jim before leaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay out of my way!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she now vanished the Boss could only smile. It appeared Morgan Lefay would do his dirty work after all.<br />
<br />
*************************<br />
<br />
It had only been a week and Yuriko was still in shock. Somehow Darren had only defeated Evan but he had freed his very soul. Since the battle she had been in contact with Lynne. The ghost happily talking of renting with her estranged son. In death Lynne and her family had found peace at long last. <br />
<br />
With Darren enjoying some much needed down time, Yuriko now once more performed the ceremony to summon the ghost of Lynne Harris. A cold wind now began to circulate around the room as Lynne&#39;s spirit now began to form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuriko!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko paused, taken aback by the frantic expression on Lynne&#39;s face. &quot;What is it Lynne,&quot; she asked. &quot;Whats wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its Evan,&quot; she said fearfully, Yuriko noting the look of terror on the ghosts face. &quot;Hes gone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the Himalayan Mountains<br />
<br />
Dhriti paused as she now slowly approached the spare bedroom. Yesterday she had been simply traveling to market when she had discovered a man close to her age lying in the snow. Always a compassionate woman, the 27 year old woman had quickly taken the man to her home before treating him. Amazingly, despite some minor frost bite, he was in perfect health. &quot;How are you feeling Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan groaned, slowly rolling over as he gazed at the woman. A small smile spreading across his face as he looked at his attractive savior. &quot;Got a hell of a headache.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your lucky that&#39;s all you have,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;What were you doing in the mountains, in a snow bank, with only a leather jacket, tshirt, and jeans?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan paused, honestly he wasn&#39;t sure. The fight against Darren had purged him of his hate, given him peace. He had happily accepted the fact he was to spend eternity in the afterlife with his parents. Then, the unexpected happened. Evan could only chalk it up to whatever spell the Normal had cast to resurrect him. It appeared that whatever their methods were, it prevented him from dying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Not even sure how I ended up here.&quot; Evan now paused, slowly sitting up in bed as he gazed at Dhriti. &quot;Thanks for saving me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont thank me yet,&quot; Dhriti stated. &quot;We&#39;re in the middle of nowhere. I may have been able to treat some of your injuries but you have a long recovery ahead of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh I&#39;ve always been a fast healer,&quot; he shrugged, Dhriti sighing in annoyance. &quot;Are you always this insufferable,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only with people I like,&quot; he smirked, Dhriti blushing slightly before pushing Evan back down. &quot;You need rest,&quot; she said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your right,&quot; Evan sighed. &quot;Thanks again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, &quot; she said softly. &quot;So what are your plans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have alot of mistakes I have to atone for,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Its gonna take sometime though, kinda hoping you can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dhriti paused, unsure of what to make of this handsome stranger. She had always been a compassionate woman but she was still unsure of Evans motives. &quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Evan stated. &quot;Lets just start by getting to know eachother first. I&#39;m trying to turn over a new leaf, hoping I can take thise first steps with you.&quot; Dhritit smiled, going back to her cooking as Evan sighed. Maybe this time he could forge a path that didn&#39;t end in destruction.</p>
