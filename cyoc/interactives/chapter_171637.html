<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Joe scanned the room, nothing seemed to be out of place. He had gotten a bit scared when the light shone, but now that he thought about it, what did he expect? There was no way anything was going to change. It was likely just a prank gift. But free was free so he couldn&#39;t really complain. <br />
<br />
Sighing in relief, Joe went to sit down when all of a sudden his legs gave out from underneath him, causing him to fall forward. To his shock, he no longer could move his arms as he went to brace his fall. And ended up flopping down onto his face. But it didnt hurt. He had just face planted the tile floor, and yet he felt nothing, no pain, no ache, nothing was bleeding, etc... <br />
<br />
He tried again to stand up, but all that he managed to do was create a wet flopping sound behind him. He tried looking back, but his body didn&#39;t work like it was supposed to. He was beginning to panic. He couldn&#39;t figure out how to move. Hell. He couldn&#39;t even see what to move. And no matter how much he tried, all that happened was a wet flopping sound occasionally happened behind him. <br />
<br />
After another minute, he was in no better shape. However a parrot suddenly landed in front of him. He recognized it as the one from the shop, but why was it even here? How was it here? Now that he thought about it, he must have left the bedroom window open from last night. So that was how it got in, but whg was she here? The parrot looked over him and spoke. &quot;I am so sorry. I forgot to warn you to set down a mirror before you open it. Uh, hmm let&#39;s see. Right, I am going to need hands for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe was kind of shocked at the bird&#39;s words. Mostly because they didn&#39;t sound like a bird&#39;s voice at all. Then right before his eyes, the bird began to shift and contort, and gain size until the Carolyn was there sitting right in front of him. &quot;Right, I can explain. Uh... well, not really. But enough to help you, maybe... Anyways the box made me a parrot, and now I can swap between forms. You, well. I don&#39;t know how to discribe you really. Umm, you are... a sex... squid, maybe? Kinda? It is hard to say really... Oh right, mirror! Uh, where is a mirror I could barrow?&quot; <br />
<br />
Some how this wierd sales clerk had ended up in his appartment and now was asking to use his mirror? And what the hell is a sex squid? Joe had too many questions. But he had to agree that seeing himself would likely solve most of the pressing issues, so he told her. &quot;Top drawer, bathroom vanity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, got it. Uh, don&#39;t move.&quot; Said Carolyn as she ran to fetch the mirror. A few seconds later she returned and sat down again, this time holding up the mirror for you. Getting a look at your self, you couldn&#39;t believe how accurate sex squid was. You were essentially a dick shaped mass, with your eyes on the gland. Except instead of a urethra opening, it was a pussy, with a clit and everything. At the base of the dick was a ring of orbs, with 2 larger ones on either side where your legs use to be. Each orb had a long tendril like thing comming out of it. The 2 larger orbs each had a thicker tendril that was longer and ended in a small flat mass of fanned out skin. When Carolyn moved the mirror, you saw that in the center of the orb ring, is what you assumed to be your asshole. Your body was skin colored, and you were covered in a cloudy white mucus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking hell. What the, how the fuck is happening to me, Carolyn?&quot; Asked Joe. &quot;Er, how to put this in a way you can understand... um.. Magic?&quot; She said, although it sounded like she was even questioning it herself. &quot;Yeah. I got that part. I guess what I am wondering now is how does magic fix me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is up to you. Only you can turn yourself back. But you need to gain control over your new body to do it so, I can help you practice at least. According to my sister, you are what is known to the magic society as a sex squid. Or a fetish shifter. Basically your body is meant purely for sex. It is the only thing it excels at beyond any other creature. And you move extremely well in water, on land you can either move like a snake, or split your tentacles into 2 sets and use them as legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a shitty deal. I can&#39;t even stand let alone walk, and how do I even learn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I learned how to fly, lay eggs, eat with a beak, and trained my vocal cords so that I could talk as a parrot. I think you can manage to at least slither.&quot; Carolyn said in an attempt to cheer you up, but how she said it made it sound really condescending. &quot;Your right, now that I at least now what I look like, I may as well try.&quot; <br />
<br />
It took quite a few attempts but he finally was able to hold his body upright after a half hour of failing miserably. Carolyn had helped out a lot by assisting him with identifying which tentacles he was moving at any given time. And after another 2 hours, he was finally able to stand with Carolyn helping to balance himself. Another hour and he could take his first step. Then another and he was able to walk with only minor guidance. And after another hour and a half, he was able to lower his foot tentacles by 2 (one per &quot;foot&quot;) so he could have a set of &quot;arms&quot;. Finally after so many hours of relearning how to function, he was back in control for the most part. And was finally able to switch back to his human body.</p>
