<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No diaper,&quot; retorted Tanner, automatically without thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanner, you&#39;ve already gotten so young and wet the underoos I gave you. There&#39;s no telling how much younger you&#39;re going to get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanner couldn&#39;t help but recognize that Derrick was right, but there was something off about this. Derrick was thinking responsibly like an actual older brother would, but the most odd thing was the fact that struck Tanner, now that he thought about it, was that Derrick was carrying him relatively easily. While an eight year old might be bigger than a two year old, for some reason it seemed odd to think that Derrick carrying him was so effortless a task for him. Things began to fall into place as Tanner noticed the ground seemed to be getting farther away, and yet he didn&#39;t feel any sort of tingling.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but... Derwick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No butts, Derrick. I don&#39;t want to see it, and you don&#39;t want it exposed, do you?&quot; questioned Derrick as he shifted how he carried Tanner, placing him more up on his shoulder. As he did, he playfully swatted Tanner&#39;s uncovered bottom, which didn&#39;t really hurt but shocked Tanner as he felt a larger hand against it than he would have thought Derrick would have had.<br />
<br />
&quot;That probably went over your head... oh well, I thought it was funny,&quot; commented Derrick.<br />
<br />
Tanner&#39;s worst fears were confirmed when Derrick opened the door to his room and in addition to Derrick&#39;s bed, Tanner saw a crib. Wait, why would there be a crib in here? Additionally there was a small changing table where some of Derrick&#39;s toys had been, which were now conspicuously missing. How these things had suddenly appeared, Tanner began to suddenly wonder.<br />
<br />
Tanner got a better look at his now older big brother when Derrick plopped him down in the crib. Derrick looked far older than eight, heck, he looked more on the edge of puberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You big...&quot; said Tanner in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m big. I&#39;m fourteen after all. I better be big. God, when did these clothes get so fucking tight?&quot; asked Derrick as he tore off his shirt which had begun to ride up his body at that point. The next to go were the shorts, leaving Derrick standing in underoos that clearly hadn&#39;t kept up with Derrick&#39;s growth, as they looked stretched to the max. This too was shucked to the floor, leaving Derrick&#39;s now decidedly teenage cock and balls free to the open air.  Some muscles were apparent on Derrick&#39;s now older body, making him look like a lanky but athletic young teen. Derrick, free from his old clothes then walked unashamedly to his closet to find clothes that would better fit him.<br />
<br />
Fourteen? But that would mean Derrick was six years older than he should be--just like Tanner was six years younger. And then it hit him. His age wasn&#39;t vanishing, it was being transferred to Derrick, slowly but surely. A moment later, Derrick seemed to grow again, this time groaning as he did. It didn&#39;t seem like too much growth, but the difference definitely made Derrick cross the line from child-teen to more of a definite teenager as he gained a few more inches in height and a bit more muscle to fill out his frame. It looked though, as if he&#39;d only gained a year. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, I&#39;m horny,&quot; stated Derrick as he stepped into gym shorts and tied them around the boner that had grown at the same time as Derrick had. Derrick&#39;s voice also made the definite transition from boy to man with that growth.<br />
<br />
Scared for what Derrick&#39;s growth might mean for him, Tanner looked down at himself to see that he was still two, thankfully. But then where did that year come from?<br />
<br />
It was as Tanner was trying to answer this question that he then felt a tingling sensation of his own, and yet another groan was heard from Derrick. Tanner turned to see Derrick pawing at his erection underneath the gym shorts, before pulling one of the legs on the shorts up and over his erection and allowing himself to begin to masturbate.<br />
<br />
Tanner himself then began to feel far weaker than he had before as he began to wabble until he fell on his back, unable to even sit up anymore. The world then grew fuzzy and larger as his vision grew blurry. From some distant memory of Sex Ed, Tanner recalled that newborn infants had trouble seeing far distances. Just then he... what had he been thinking? Suddenly he couldn&#39;t remember. He was alone and a strange noise was coming from somewhere nearby. Some deep scary noise. Frightened, Tanner cried out.<br />
<br />
Just as Derrick moaned out in relief as he came in his hand, Tanner began to cry. Derrick laid there for a moment before tiredly picking himself up and stumbling over to head to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, Tanner... Daddy will be right back,&quot; mumbled Derrick as he left the room to wash himself off. It had been a while since he&#39;d last been with a girl--something the presence of Tanner made far more difficult now. As far as Derrick could recall, Tanner&#39;s mother had been a girl he&#39;d dated around the Sophmore Dinner Dance but didn&#39;t want the responsibility of a child to hold her back as she prepared to move on with her life for college. Derrick&#39;s parents had insisted he take on his own son, saying that Tanner was his responsibility and would help him learn to be a better man. Right at the moment, Tanner was teaching him what a pain in the ass babies could be. Having cleaned up, the seventeen year old sighed and walked back into his room and immediately went over to the crib that his parents had insisted was in his room. Derrick scooped his infantile son up and held him tightly and began to bounce him up and down. Tanner soon began to calm down, and Derrick sat down to rock Tanner to sleep. There were times like this that Derrick didn&#39;t mind being a teenage father. Tanner could be quite awesome when he wasn&#39;t crying so much, and to some extent Derrick imagined that this might be what having a little brother might be like--something he&#39;d always wanted, but his parents had never gone out of their way for him to have.</p>
