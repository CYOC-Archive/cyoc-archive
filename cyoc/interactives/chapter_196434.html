<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
Jack Caldwell supposed that it was time for his own meeting with the principal. He&#39;d been called in for some reason to talk to him about academic stuff - or something like that. A lot of the boys here looked forward to meeting with Belinda. She was more or less their walking wet dream. And honestly, Jack was no exception. Thin but lean, Jack was not exactly the paragon of masculinity - but he was confident enough in his physical abilities and attractiveness. His dark hair was tidy and well combed, letting him reasonably well attract whosoever he wanted.<br />
<br />
Jack identified as bisexual, and while he presented himself as more toward the twink end of the gay / bi community, he made use of his boyishly good looks to get quite a few invites to school dances. Such resplendent success with both sexes did however lend to something of an ego - though he didn&#39;t quite show it often. Today however as he thought about his impending visit with Belinda, the cocky young man thought about how he might be able to use this to get preferential treatment.<br />
<br />
<i>If I can work my magic on Principal Belinda, maybe I can get treated special. Maybe even get away with fucking around, pranking the jocks or something! Sky&#39;s the limit!</i> He cupped his chin as he thought about it. At present he was just packing up books into his locker, contemplating the fantasy.<br />
<br />
<i>She&#39;s such a babe. Mm, I think I can still make that date with that closeted jock hunk Carter afterwards. I swear, dude, it&#39;s the 21st century. You&#39;d think he should be more open...ah well.</i><br />
<br />
By the time of the meeting, Jack made sure everything was in order - he didn&#39;t want to come off like a slob after all! - and he headed into the office. The first thing he noticed was the atmosphere. The place was neat, orderly, with a few little candles in places - odor candles, designed to let off a pleasant aroma into the area. A few sniffs informed Jack that the air was heady, smelled really nice, and definitely set a mood. It made him feel comfortable.<br />
<br />
As he took a seat and Belinda entered, Jack wondered if she was real.<br />
<br />
Her boobs, that is. He swore she had to have implants or something to be that big in the chest. Her features were fair, and completely unblemished. Her lips were just thick enough to be desirable, but not so thick as to seem too artificial. She wore a tight blue ensemble, her hair tied back in the back, and as he settled in he swore she had on some kind of perfume. Fuck.<br />
<br />
Jack was barely sat down two minutes when he was harder than he&#39;d ever been in his life.<br />
<br />
Thankfully his jeans didn&#39;t make his predicament too obvious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Jack, glad to see you in here,&quot; Belinda stated as she started looking through some files.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to be in here, Miss Principal,&quot; Jack replied, trying to turn on the charm. She seemed unflappable however. She probably knew doing anything with him would be illegal - and playing into any devious schemes he had. While it rankled Jack&#39;s ego, he supposed he&#39;d have to accept it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll admit, Mr. Caldwell,&quot; she said as she looked through files, &quot;I&#39;m impressed by your grades so far, and your attendance is top notch...&quot; she seemed to smile, &quot;Though I will say one area that could be improved is...maturity. You&#39;re very open, Jack, and in the present that&#39;s more admirable than you can know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I try to be, Miss Principal.&quot; Jack tersely responded. Fuck but he was still hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...hm,&quot; she seemed to think of something, leaning forward and inducing quite a blush in Jack, &quot;Do you think...you can try to assume a more &quot;teacher-like&quot; role with the other students...? I&#39;d like to see a more mature, leadership oriented Jack Caldwell. Do you think you can achieve that? And I know you&#39;re putting in a lot of effort with the gym class...do you think you can help Mr. Holtz out with that class...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, this was an interesting idea. Jack figured this might be his way forward. His clothes for some reason were feeling tighter than usual, though he was rather offput by the way she brought up gym class. He didn&#39;t remember being so on-point with gym class. He hated it much like many others did. But he supposed this was a means for him to try to worm his way into Belinda&#39;s graces. While he presented himself as a mature and calm person, he saw any possibility of getting with the principal as a mark of status.<br />
<br />
She was a trophy to be won, as crude as that was. He still thought of himself as firmly in control even as he adjusted his shirt collar. &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; he said, &quot;I can do whatever you need me to do, Miss Principal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear it,&quot; she said with a flourish of her hand, &quot;Glad to hear it. You can start as soon as possible. You can feel free to leave. I understand you have your own life to lead I suppose. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing more of a mature Jack Caldwell around the campus going forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you will.&quot; Jack nodded as he got up. And he swore he was going to need to switch these fucking clothes out. His muscles seemed to be chafing against the clothes... honestly, maybe he should embrace what she was saying. Get something a little more mature, a little more capable of handling him. <br />
<br />
As Jack left the office, he didn&#39;t notice his hair shifting into a slightly more official, &quot;office&quot; style haircut - more of a crew cut than what he wore before.</p>
