<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since you’re going to turn Dean into a stallion, you’re going to make him the best stallion there is: a Clydesdale stallion. These beasts weigh around 2,000 pounds and are over 7 feet tall including the head. Knowing this, you’re anxious to see how Dean’s going to progress over the following month.<br />
<br />
“Where do you want to go tonight?” Dean asked.<br />
“Uhh... we could try and crash a college party,” you suggest. Dean looks at you and seems to nod in agreement.<br />
“We’re basically in college anyway, I think that’d work. I’m going to head home and get ready then in case I can bring a girl home tonight,” he said, giving you a light punch on the arm. Already it seems as if he’s improved in strength and it’s barely been an hour. As Dean’s leaving, you take a quick picture to compare with later at the party. <br />
<br />
Later that night, you pick Dean up from his house and are already impressed by how quickly he’s putting on mass. He stood about a quarter inch taller, now at 5’11” and seemed to have a spring in his step. He wore basketball shorts that showed off his currently smooth legs that were thickened up by muscle. His thighs stretched the shorts out and as he got in your car, you could see his impressive bubble butt as he turned to sit down. Dean’s shorts bulged out in the back as well as in the front, letting you know the stallion transformation hadn’t hit him in the front just yet. Looking him up in the car, Dean had already pushed out to more than modest pecs and large, yet undefined biceps. He already put on around 15 pounds of muscle and none of that muscle was toned yet. Something about all of Dean’s curves was turning you on, but you knew you could wait.<br />
<br />
“I already saw a few parties going down on my phone; the craziest one by far is the one at Kappa Rho Alpha frat if you need an idea,” Dean said. You were still taking in his body when you realized what he said.<br />
“Yeah that was actually the party I had in mind,” you lied, banking on Dean to find one for you. At the party, college kids were pouring into the house, lit up red and blue while blasting rap music. You and Dean walk inside and you can already hear the murmurs about Dean’s body. Ladies that want to see him all out in bed and men that want to be taken by him. Plenty of guys and girls are offering Dean beer and drugs to impress him, and a few smarter ones offer you too to really get on Dean’s good side.<br />
<br />
“I can hook you guys up with anything you want: vodka, weed, cocaine, even a little bit of PCP if that’s what you want,” said some guy in an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt. He had dirty blond hair, a gold necklace around his muscular neck, his shirt unbottoned revealing a toned and tanned chest and abs to follow. He had yellow beach shorts on underneath that led down to his ripped legs that stood him at about 6’1”. “My name’s Noah, co-captain of the fraternity, are you guys looking to join?” He shouted over the music and crowd. You could see in Dean’s shorts that he was interested in Noah, having been Dean’s friend for so long and always trying to get a look. Maybe it was the lighting, but he seemed slightly bigger than he usually did.<br />
“Me and my friend Jeff here would love to get started with some drinks, isn’t that right buddy?” Dean asked.<br />
“Yeah I’ll just have a few beers, but I think Dean here might need some of your strong stuff,” you say to Noah, letting him know Dean’s name.<br />
“Alright guys! Jeff we’ve got beers in the cooler downstairs and if you want some stronger stuff I’ll have to take you into the backyard Dean,” Noah said. You turn to the cooler quickly to hide your smirk: you can already tell these two are going to make moves on each other.<br />
<br />
After downing two beers and mingling around the party a bit, you start to look for Dean. You’ve been grinding up against a few party members but want to see Dean’s progress before you  try and make some night ending moves yourself. You look outside for Dean and Noah around the main floor, the basement, and outside to no avail. You start walking upstairs where a few couples are spending time together and the crowd thins out. The doors on the second floor are intermittently open and closed, all the open ones being empty and the closed ones mostly having female moans coming from them. As you walk down the hall, you see another staircase roped off for “fraternity purposes,” but you know what you saw downstairs and step over the rope. You quietly begin stepping upstairs all the while the voices upstairs grow louder. Near the upstairs landing you can peer over the floor to see Dean and Noah talking together on a mattress.<br />
<br />
All you hear is Noah’s voice say “I’m ready,” before the two of them start making out and undressing each other. Noah loses his shirt and his back is just as muscular as his front. Dean goes next revealing his puffed out chest and flat abs underneath. He still doesn’t have definition, but Noah does giving you the best of both worlds. Dean starts bringing down Noah’s shorts and you see an impressive 8” bulge in his briefs. Great asset, you think, and take your phone out of your pocket.<br />
“My turn..” you hear Dean say and immediately snap back up to watch. Dean starts to pull his shorts down and his boxers tent up right away. It’s much larger than you ever anticipated and you have to assume the transformation caused it. Dean’s circumsized tip are exposed out of the boxers and even Noah’s surprised by this, taking off his own underwear. Dean’s massively smooth body and Noah’s thinner but toned frame contrast each other in an incredibly sexy manner. Especially both of the men’s dicks fitting their body, Dean’s being long and thick while Noah had length and looked slightly veiny. Before you get lost in euphoria, you takenout your phone to take a picture of the two of them- only to forget that your sound is on! After taking two pictures, all three of you hear the sound and turn. Dean and Noah turn to the stairs while you turn and run downstairs. Everybody’s going to think what’s happening to Dean is normal, but what you do still has consequences! You run back into the party and after a few moments head home.<br />
<br />
By tomorrow morning, Dean will be rounding out to about 3% stallion. Every night would be a quick boost in the transformation, but Dean still has 2000 pounds to put on and a whole body transformation too. You sit up in bed reflecting on this anticipating Dean’s next big change.</p>
