<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anne was pointing at a herd of zebras; the group were standing a long way off but became interested in the girls as they gathered around the fence. Jen stood at the back of the group, her mind full of crazy thoughts that the curse might be real. Weirdly only about half of the herd seemed interested, the rest stayed where they had been standing before.<br />
<br />
The herd reached the fence and muzzles found their way through the chain link, allowing the girls to touch the animals. “Wow! They’re so friendly!” Anne said.<br />
<br />
“I know, don’t you love it!” Susan said back, letting one zebra lick her hand. “Come on Jen, don’t be shy; touch one!” <br />
<br />
Jen was reluctant, but her rational mind convinced her that she was panicking over nothing. The group formed a pathway so that Jen could get closer to the animals, as she approached they became visibly excited, the whole striped mass surging forwards making the fence bend outwards. Jen reached her hand out to touch one of the muzzles; the zebra whined and brayed as it licked her hand.<br />
<br />
As soon as her hand made contact the whole group heaved again, the fence bent to an extreme angle as the weight of over 50 zebras pushed against it.<br />
<br />
“Er... I don’t think the fence is supposed to do that...” Rachel, another cheerleader said nervously, backing away from the bulge. The other girls did the same thing, but, as Jen went to move away the herd grew more agitated again and pushed as one against the fence.<br />
A park ranger ran over, shouting “get away from the fence!” And people started to run away as the sound of breaking chain and cracking fence posts grew louder.<br />
<br />
The cheerleaders ran with the rest of the crowd as the park ranger was joined by more keepers and they formed a barrier of people between the crowd and the buckling fence. Suddenly the fence seemed to flatten in slow motion as the whining zebras surged forward. One of the keepers shouted “Don’t worry, they’re like horses, they won’t try to get past us” Only to be flattened seconds later by a stampede of zebras moving up the path in the direction of the terrified cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
“Look out” People shouted, trying to jump out of the way, some climbed trees while others took refuge behind walls in flower beds. The cheerleaders ran as fast as they could but the zebras easily caught them. The crowd thinned as more and more people got out of the herds way, they were insistently following Jen.<br />
<br />
“Jen look out!” Susan cried as Jen was pushed to the floor by one of the animals, Jen screamed as she landed, rolling over onto her back she looked up at the mass of black and white stripes around her, she was convinced she was about to be trampled but instead they started to lick her insistently, Jen screamed again “Help me!”, she could see that the cheerleaders had climbed a nearby tree and Susan was perched on a branch that over hung Jen’s position on the path.<br />
<br />
“Jen!” she cried. The zebra’s licking was progressing down her body as different individuals jostled for position licking the bemused girl. She rolled over and tried to crawl away only to be bitten gently on the ass and pulled back, her skirt ripped and she screamed as it was dragged away by one of the muzzles.<br />
<br />
This seemed to fuel the animals scramble even further, with her skirt now ripped off Jen’s face was pushed into the ground and her ass was raised into the air as muzzles fought to push against her. She cried as she felt another forceful muzzle push her panties up, tearing them so they hung like a belt around her middle. Suddenly the licking stopped and Jen could feel just one muzzle on her now bare ass, looking down herself she screamed in terror. She could hear the shouts of other people from beyond the striped wall that had engulfed her.<br />
<br />
“Please help me!” she cried as an unfamiliar sensation washed through her abdomen. She watched in horror as the herd stood still and watched the lone zebra at her ass lower its head further. It’s muzzle pushed against her pussy, Jen winced as she was pushed forward. The muzzle pushed again but this time Jen felt it shift and hot breathing filled her pussy. “No!” she screamed as it pushed again, the muzzle pushed into her pussy deeper, the hot breathing was become more distant as the zebra’s head filled her deeper and deeper.<br />
<br />
Jen continued to scream and tried desperately to get away, her legs flailing around the head of the animal. She felt herself lifted slightly by the animal and looked down to see her pussy stretched around the muzzle of the zebra. She stopped screaming as instead watched in horror as her pussy stretched around its head, its eyes and ears disappearing inside her.<br />
<br />
Jen felt sick, and threw up onto the path in front of her as she was lifted by the animal. She was raised by the zebra until she was above the rest of the herd, she looked down to see her pussy impaled on the head of a zebra, and it’s neck now slowly sinking inside her.<br />
<br />
She could now see the crowd of onlookers that had gathered around the herd, no longer running they instead watched with morbid fascination as the zebra was slowly sucked into the half naked girl.<br />
Jen was becoming detached from the situation; she could make out Susan calling her name but couldn’t focus on it for an extended period. Her view was slowly becoming lower until her pussy had completely engulfed the head and neck of the zebra. As she was lowered the rest of the herd sprung back to life, reanimating into another frenzy of licking and nibbling. Jen tried to fight them off but her kicks and punched offered little resistance as her top was bitten and ripped off along with her bra.<br />
<br />
Through tear stained eyes the naked girl watched her legs retract quickly into her body and felt a bizarre suction in her groin as she fused with the zebra. Her shoes and socks dropped to the floor uselessly. Her ass shifted and disappeared as her back was raised higher, her pussy fusing with the ‘shoulders’ of the animal until it vanished leaving the girl with the body of a zebra from the waist down, the striped fur forming a trail that ended below her navel. The licking from the other zebras now focuses on her belly and the join between her and the zebra slowly started to cease as they became more docile.<br />
<br />
Jen wiped away her tears and started to shout again.</p>
