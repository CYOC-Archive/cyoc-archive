<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike looked at the ring, not sure for a moment what to do. He was about to put it on, when Emily poked the tip of her tail between the ring and his finger. She shook her head, then slowly pushed her head forward until her scaly lips met his, and kissed him very gently. She opened her eyes again, and there was a rumble coming from her body. It seemed she was hungry.<br />
<br />
She felt a hunger coming out of nowhere, overriding her other thoughts, and she started drooling... a warm... prey? No, no. Not prey. But so hungry... She knew she couldn't eat the human but she had to eat *something*. Maybe he could help her?<br />
<br />
Mike got the message and quickly ran to the fridge and returned with all the meat he could find. She swallowed it eagerly, no piece of meat too large for her mouth, though the metal band first had to come off. The bulges immediately disappeared, as though they melted instantly. The rumbling returned very quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'll get you proper snake food. Don't you worry!&quot; He kissed her on the nose and went outside, driving too fast as he tried to find a place to get a proper snake meal. Then he suddenly hit the brakes and stopped in front of a nearby farm. Or perhaps more of a petting zoo, a farm that only had some animals. Animals...<br />
<br />
Half an hour later Emily's head perked up as a screech indicated Mike had returned. Moments later he walked in, carrying a small pig, hogtied, but still squirming - man those things are strong. Even though it was a 'small' pig, it must have still weighed sixty pounds at least. A good meal for a 200 pound snake...<br />
<br />
Emily opened her mouth, and Mike carefully pushed the pig into her. She was probably still new to being a snake and needed some help... It turned out she had no problem eating pigs. Her mouth slid around the pig, and even though it squirmed, it was no match for her coils. It was slowly pushed back, as her mouth moved forward. A minute later the hog was a bulge in the snake, still squirming. &quot;Great. That should hold you for a while.&quot; Mike muttered. &quot;If not, I've... got more in the truck.&quot; He shifted his unexpected erection away. Feeding Emily such a large meal had a certain erotic charm to it...<br />
<br />
Emily suddenly threw her head back and hissed. Mike jumped, afraid his girlfriend had gone nuts, but apparently it was a hiss of pleasure. There was a loud gurgling coming from the bulge, and a groaning and creaking from Emily's body. She started growing as the bulge disappeared. A few seconds later and she was now a 260 pound snake with an empty stomach. The hunger returned, even stronger this time. Emily looked at Mike pleadingly. As much as a snake could, anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I supposed to do?&quot; Mike wondered out loud. &quot;If I don't feed her... there's no telling what she'll do. But if I do, she'll grow even bigger.&quot; He looked down at the large snake. He had in the meantime backed away from her, and she was slowly crawling after him. There were... tears in her eyes? Did snakes shed tears? He knelt down and gently stroked her head. &quot;Oh, it's okay... don't worry...&quot; He held her head close to his chest and patted her, as she continued to cry. She looked up at him, silently, but moved her snake body around him, gently caressing him. It was like a full body massage, everywhere at once, and she tugged at his shirt playfully, then turned to look away, bashfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to...?&quot; He asked, perplexed. She nodded, still not looking him in the eye. &quot;Er... okay...&quot; As he took his clothes off, she looked at him longingly. She needed him, badly. When he was done, she slithered around him, the cool smooth scales felt like supple leather around him. She playfully licked him, and moved her genitals closer to his. Apparently she didn't have a cloaca, but a human vagina instead. Since she also had hearing, some measure of intelligence, and tear glands, that was not too far of a stretch...<br />
<br />
Then the rumbling returned again, stronger this time. Her grip tensed, and she fought to resist the urge to bite... She looked away, tears in her eyes... Mike stared at her blankly for a moment, not sure what to do next. He certainly felt sorry for her, and kinda wanted to continue this, but couldn't do that when she was hungry...</p>
