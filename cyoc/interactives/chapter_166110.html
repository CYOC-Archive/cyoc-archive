<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[Fine, I guess I have a bit of a request. You see, I am a bit full, and my hands are currently holding up my body, so if you know... if you could milk me, I-I would appreciate it] Ophelia though meekly. <br />
<br />
[Of course, but please be quiet about it. She is still sleeping on your back. So no moaning or mooing, got it.] Instructed Kyla.<br />
<br />
[Right, I wont make a sound] confidently said Ophelia.<br />
<br />
[And are you sure she will be fine with me doing this? This doesn&#39;t count as cheating per say, but I would feel bad if I messed in your love life.] <br />
<br />
[Well, we never said anything about it. Plus you are not just anyone, and I trust you. Also, I really need to be emptied, or I will start to spray and endless amount of milk from the pressure.] explained Ophelia.<br />
<br />
[Doesn&#39;t that hurt like, a lot? Why would you ever let them get that full?] thought a shocked Kyla who immediately retrieved a large bowl from one of the cabinets and placed it under Ophelia. [I will try to be gentle, but I have never milked a cow, let alone a women, so please let me know if there is something better I can do to make it easier on you.] And with that, Kyla began to gently squeeze Ophelia&#39;s H-cups.<br />
<br />
[Wait. You dont need to squeeze them. Just pull down on my teats. It is a similar method to how a baby sucks on on their mother&#39;s nipple.] corrected Ophelia.<br />
<br />
[Is that so] Kyla thought to herself. An evil grin appearing on her face.<br />
<br />
Ophelia realized what was about to happen to her when she saw Kyla&#39;s face. But given her current position and the situation with her tits, she couldn&#39;t really complain too much. Kyla moved the bowl out of the way and laid down with her underneath Ophelia. Using only her tongue, which also was long and dexterous like Ophelia&#39;s, she guided one of her teats into her open mouth and began sucking. Milk quickly began to flow out, going down her throat. She had fallen in love with the taste immediately, her rate of sucking growing quicker and quicker. But for whatever reason, even with all of her sucking, it never seemed to have any effect on the remaining quantity. <br />
<br />
It was at this time, that Heather woke up again, now fully rested. &quot;Morning honey. Eh, why am I on your back in the kitchen?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, morning Heather. Kyla came over and made breakfast for you. She put it in the fridge. And also, could you maybe help her out a bit?&quot; responded Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh sure, with what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just look below us, she is trying to milk me, but it seems like she isn&#39;t getting very far. And I seriously am about to begin leaking again.&quot;   <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, she is milking you right now?&quot; Heather said, getting off of Ophelia&#39;s back, her no-longer knotted cock sliding out of her with a subtle pop, slipping back into its sheath. She then saw Kyla, flat on her back, sucking on Ophelia&#39;s right H-cup as she used her fingers to milk the 2 smaller ones on the same side. Milk had already made a small puddle which was gradually growing in size, covering a good part of the kitchen floor. There was a drain near the one wall, which the milk had begun making its way towards. The room was level, but somehow the milk only moved towards the drain, and not the other walls. Likely Beldazarr&#39;s magic had something to do with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey move over a bit&quot; commanded Heather to Kyla, who politely shifted her body to now be only on the left side. Heather crawled underneath and excitedly took the right, Mirroring Kyla&#39;s actions. <br />
<br />
[Go ahead and moan or whatever Ophelia, I am now awake, so feel free to let loose] thought Heather to Ophelia. Almost immediately as she said this, Ophelia broke out into a series of moans, while mixing in a moo here and there because she thought it was fun to do. This however just made the situation a whole lot lewder than what it originally was intended to be. <br />
<br />
Ophelia was not sexually attracted to Kyla like she was to Heather. Her wish was still in effect, making only herself and Heather attractive to her sexually. That was until Heather made a decision for her. [Sweetie, I have decided that I will permit you, but only for today, to find Kyla sexually attractive.] <br />
<br />
It was like a switch had flipped in her mind. Kyla&#39;s appearance had gone from being nothing special, to being extraordinarily beautiful. Her proportions were ideal. Her nice E-cups were proudly contained within a black brocade collared top with a black cupless corset styled vest which looked like it belonged in a steampunk world. With every breath, they would rise and fall. She could tell they were nice and firm too, as their shape never flopped around, but would instead only slightly jiggle as she sucked away. She noticed another detail that somehow she missed before. The corset, being cupless, did not cover up her tits or nipples, which were currently very erect. But her decorative black colored lacy bra and satin undershirt which had the fabric made to follow the bra&#39;s cup line, covered them just enough, while making an impressive cleavage.<br />
<br />
Below that, she had another thing which also seemed to belong in some steampunk world, a black Victorian high low ruffle skirt. Its tail fell just under her knees, or it would be if she were currently standing. Just thinking about it and how it would make her long, smooth legs look amazing was turning Ophelia on even more. However, now her entire outfit is soaked in breast milk.<br />
<br />
Ophelia was taking in just how unusual the current situation was. She could never imagined that today she would be in a situation where not only her naked girlfriend but also her girlfriend&#39;s sister&#39;s boss&#39; wife in a sexy steampunk outfit, were both lying on their backs underneath her own naked body, breastfeeding from her tits, while milking the other 4, soaking themselves in the process. All she could do was just stand their on all fours and let her tits be pleasantly drained while she kept moaning uncontrollably. She knew Heather was awesome at sucking her tits, but Kyla was just as good too, if not a little better since she could use her longer tongue to fondle her simultaneously. Her attire, while unusual, was also perfect for her. It fit her image to a T for some reason. Maybe her back length black hair, or maybe the aura of maturity she produced were the reason? Either way, it made her really want to get an outfit like hers for herself.<br />
<br />
[Sweetie, use that amazing tongue of yours to keep us clean, would you] seductively suggested Heather. She didn&#39;t have to tell her twice. Ophelia immediately lashed out her tongue and plunged it deep into Kyla&#39;s cleavage, lapping up the pooling milk. The sudden intrution into her cleavage startled her for a second, but when she felt how expertly Ophelia&#39;s skill with her tongue was, she happily didn&#39;t argue any further and readjusted her posture to ensure all of the milk on her chest rolled down into her cleavage.<br />
<br />
This continued for another 10 minutes until Ophelia&#39;s C-cups finally ran dry. Having no more milk to extract, Both Heather and Kyla reached over and began fondling one of the other&#39;s tits, their outside hand started fingering themselves. Ophelia had also a while ago, slid the tip of her own tail into her own pussy, fucking herself as hard as she could manage. She also had moved over to Heather and was currently slipping her tongue fairly deep into her extended urethra. which she had Beldazarr grant a wish that would allow her tongue to easily slide down it into her balls, so she could lick her testicles from the inside painlessly, while causing her immense pleasure. The sight of her tongue moving around inside of her scrotum was especially erotic. Heather had by now stopped sucking her boob, now incapable of doing much more than arching her back while gasping heavily from the insane amount of pleasure. Her mind had blanked out already, the rest of her body had gone numb from the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Kyla also had stopped drinking, leaving Ophelia with 2 dripping teats with about 20% milk left in them. She was simply staring at the both of them. The level of pleasure Ophelia was causing Heather was so intense, she was starting to feel it herself by just watching. Heather was in pure bliss. She was also making sure she didn&#39;t die from the pleasure overloading her body or by contorting herself too much to the point she breaks. Kyla also was just a tad envious of her. And while the amount of pleasure she was feeling was very intimidating, she was curious about it as well.<br />
<br />
Having orgasmed for the 23 time in under 5 minutes, Heather finally went limp from her passing out. Noticing, Ophelia gently retracted her tongue from inside of her scrotum, her thick semen still dripping from it as she slurped it back into her mouth. Licking her lips, she too fell down onto Heather&#39;s stomach, not passed out, but just very tired. Kyla who also had gotten off numerous times by  herself and from Ophelia tail fucking her, got up and just looked at the pile of naked girls. Sighing, she picked the 2 of them up, draping Heather&#39;s limp body over her shoulder, and princess caring Ophelia. She brought the both of their immobilized bodies back to their nest where she placed them next to each other. Disrobing herself as well, she slipped in with them, undoing her human form slightly, so that her tail and wings were on display. Her color was a pinkish white, which contrasted her black hair. Basically, she was the exact opposite of Ophelia&#39;s coloration. It was unusually girly for someone with her personality to have. But it was not like she chose her color or anything. And it was kind of cute in a way. She and Ophelia wrapped their wings around the three of them, with Heather tucked in between the two of them. Both of them were resting a hand on one of her boobs, gently fondling her. <br />
<br />
Ophelia was very happy her mate was satisfied with her service. Her cum tasted really, really good when taken directly from the source. Kissing her mate once more, she too fell asleep, exhausted from the 2 hour long threesome. She may have had the physical endurance of a dragon, but her mind was still mostly human. Kyla, being the last one still awake, just continued to watch over her new friends with benefits. She loved the two of them, they were the only ones who she could call family besides her husband, who really was more like her butler than her mate. He was not nearly as good in the sac as these girls were. She had not gotten properly fucked in years, and was quite literally aching to be fucked. Her husband however, was not willing to help her. He didn&#39;t really appreciate sex like she did. He was kind to her, and did care for her, but he just never could satisfy her sexually. Now she had 2 girls who would gladly fuck her brains out if she were simply to ask. This thought had actually made her start to cry. She was finally free of the constant ache from her heat cycle. No longer would she have to suffer the dissatisfaction of sex with her husband. This had quite literally saved her marriage too. She loved him immensely. But would have had to leave him behind and seek out someone to end her endless suffering. Luckily she had found some girls who would maybe grant her wish if she asked. Excited for their future together, she too fell asleep.</p>
