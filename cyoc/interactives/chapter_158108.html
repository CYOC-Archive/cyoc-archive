<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s changes should take an hour to complete, turning him into the perfect wife for his dad in mind and body. He was eager to see what he would become. But a part of him was increasingly curious how the other three will interact with him during those changes, especially Mike.<br />
<br />
Wait, Mike? Jeff looked over to his dad. Yep that was Mike, er, his dad’s name. Wow, was his mind changing that quickly? He looked over himself. Had his body or his clothes change yet? He was still wearing the leather jacket and the jeans. His shoes looked a little different. His watch had grown larger. Jeff did notice that his chest was sticking out a little more than it usually did. It didn’t feel like he was wearing a bra, yet.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang. That must be the pizza. David, Mike, and Katie looked to the front door.<br />
<br />
“David, can you go get that? There should be cash on the counter behind you,” Mike, Jeff’s dad, said.<br />
<br />
“Me?” David repeated. “Why can’t Jeff do it?” Jeff looked at him straight in the eyes, questioningly. That was when Jeff realized he was the same height as David now.<br />
<br />
“Because I asked you to do it,” Mike said curtly. David rolled his eyes and walked away. Jeff looked to Mike. Mike shook his head sympathetically. He seemed worried that Jeff would be upset. Jeff couldn’t help himself and smiled a little bit. Mike relaxed a little. David came back in with the boxes of pizza and set them on the table. Jeff instinctively chose the chair next to Mike and grabbed a plate.<br />
<br />
“So Dad,” Katie spoke up and asked, “have you started dating anyone yet?” The question surprised Jeff. He had never known his sister to be that upfront about Mike’s dating habits.<br />
<br />
David seemed just as surprised and nearly choked on his soda. “Jeez, twerp, you might need to work on your delivery there.”<br />
<br />
Katie scowled at him. “I’m fifteen now. Don’t call me a twerp.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and I’m eighteen. Besides it’s just a nickname, not an insult,” David argued.<br />
<br />
Mike cleared his throat and spoke up, “To answer your question, Katie, I have not starting dating anyone.”<br />
<br />
“You know, Dad, it’s okay to date someone,” David added. “We’re okay with it. I’m sure Mom would be too.”<br />
<br />
“I know you are, and I’m immensely grateful,” Mike replied. He glanced at Jeff briefly with a smile before turning to his kids. Jeff took a quiet sip of his beer. This surprised Jeff once again. He wasn’t thinking about David and Katie as his siblings anymore. They were Mike’s kids. That, and Jeff was old enough to drink beer now. He checked the large, leather-strapped watch on his wrist. It was 6:15. He looked down at his body, expecting to see some more changes.<br />
<br />
He was surprised to find that he was still wearing a leather jacket and a blue flannel shirt. The shirt was pushed out significantly, but not by a pair of tits, but by a pair of large pecs. His hands were slightly larger and hairier. He scratched at his face, realizing there was a beard there now. Was this right? Jeff was turning into an older, muscular man! He wasn’t turning into a woman at all! Was Mike gay this whole time?<br />
<br />
“The truth is, and your mother knew this before she, you know,” Mike coughed again. “I’m bi.” He nervously glanced at you before continuing, “So, it’s less that I don’t feel okay with dating someone, it’s more that there is a person, and he’s a guy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” David and Katie both replied. They shared a look with each other.<br />
<br />
“Did you know?” David asked Jeff directly.<br />
<br />
“I wondered,” Jeff replied, realizing with a start that his voice was much deeper than before. Mike nervously rubbed his fingers together. “But it doesn’t bother me.” Mike looked at him with relief and relaxed his shoulders. It was kind of cute and endearing.<br />
<br />
“Same for me,” Katie then slowly said. “We just want you to be happy, Daddy.” David nodded.<br />
<br />
“She has a point,” Jeff added, realizing with a start that his voice was much deeper than before. “And if you like this guy, you should go for it. The worst he could say is no, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Right,” Mike said with a smile. They resumed eating their pizza in silence. Jeff glanced at his watch again. 6:25. He checked himself over once more and saw that his arms and shoulders had thickened. His sneakers had been completely replaced by some brown dress shoes. His jeans were black now. He wore a stylish brown belt now. His leather jacket was now hanging in the coat closet in the hall. Jeff took another sip of his protein shake while Mike did the same with his own. Mike looked a little different, maybe a little more muscular, but not by much. His face had cleared up, and his beard was more neatly trimmed than usual. He wore a dark purple dress shirt and some black slacks. He looked handsome and a little sexy in that outfit.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, realizing that he was just checking his own dad out. Well, Mike really wasn’t his dad by this point. So Jeff guessed it wasn’t too weird anymore. He couldn’t help but admire Mike’s ass in his tight pants as he stood to take the plates over to the sink. Jeff slowly got to his feet while Mike’s kids cleaned the table and left the kitchen. Mike began to wash the dishes by hand.<br />
<br />
“Mind if I help?” Jeff asked, sidling up next to Mike with a smile. Jeff was now taller than Mike by a good few inches. Mike looked up at him with soft smile.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for coming over,” Mike said to him.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Jeff said. He rolled up the sleeves of his blue flannel shirt, exposing the thick muscles in his forearms. He took the watch off and set it to the side. He plunged his hands into the soapy water and began scrubbing the plates.<br />
<br />
“You know what you said about going for it?” Mike asked. Jeff smiled and nodded. His heart was pounding in his chest. Was Mike about to say what Jeff wanted him to say? “Well, if it’s okay with you,” his hand found Jeff’s in the soapy water and grabbed onto it, “I’d like to try to go for it with you.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled broadly. “I was hoping you’d say that.” He leaned in and kissed Mike. He reached up to grab the back of Mike’s head. His hand was still wet though, and Jeff accidentally splashed soapy water all over Mike’s face. Mike laughed and splashed Jeff right back, breaking their kiss. Jeff laughed and grabbed the hose attached to the sink. He started spraying Mike back. Mike recoiled and laughed.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay! You win!” he laughed and giggled. Grinning, Jeff put the hose back and pulled Mike in for a big hug.<br />
<br />
Jeff whispered into Mike’s ear, “Sorry, sweetie. Forgot my hand was in there.” He kissed his boyfriend again.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Mike replied. “But now my shirt’s all wet.”<br />
<br />
“Oh darn, what a shame,” Jeff sarcastically complained. “I guess that means you should take it off.” Jeff took his flannel shirt off with ease, exposing the bright green tank-top underneath. It struggled to keep Jeff’s muscles in place. Mike glanced down and bit his lip. Jeff bounced his pecs teasingly. He reached for the buttons on Mike’s shirt. Mike swatted Jeff’s hands away.<br />
<br />
“The kids are just in the other room!” he hissed.<br />
<br />
“Then let’s take this upstairs then,” Jeff replied with a raised eyebrow. Blushing, Mike nodded and quickly turned to go up the stairs. Jeff picked up his watch and noted the time: 6:50. He glanced and smiled at the engagement ring on his finger before quickly following his fiancé up to their bedroom.</p>
