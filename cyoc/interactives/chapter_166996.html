<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But Mark then thought about another thing he could add to Aidan´s functions, making him smile cruelly down at Aidan. “I just realized that when your muzzle is closed, you could easily work as a chair to. Your wings are just in the right position for armrests after all. But another function for you will be the following.  When your muzzle is opened completely, your new, sharp teeth will fold to the sides, so someone could use you as a toilet. Someone can use your tongue as a seat and piss or shit in you. It will just run down your tongue like the other trash or flow down your inside surface and drop into your empty insides.”<br />
Now Aidan was even more horrified then before, if that was even possible. Now he was a chair, a dustbin and a toilet in one? Nothing changed, as no body changes were made this time. <br />
Mark pushed his muzzle open completely and dropped his own pants. Aidan mentally screamed, but could do nothing as Mark sat down on his tongue and started to piss into him for a minute. After finishing Mark stood again, pulled his pants up before turning around to close Aidan´s muzzle and hit the scale. Aidan howled in pain and disgust as the piss was absorbed into him.<br />
Just as Mark was about to make his final command to move Aidan, the doorbell rang. Before Mark could react the door was opened by Aidan´s neighbor Geoff from the outside with the spare key. “Hey Aidan, you left your sports bag by me yesterday. I thought I would bring it over.” As Geoff came in, he looked confused at Mark as he dropped the bag next to the door. “Who are you? And where is Aidan?”<br />
Mark was quick to decide what to do and answered: “I´m Mark, a friend of Aidan. He had borrowed a book from me, and is looking for it.” Geoff nodded before replying: “There is a book in his sports bag, maybe that is it?” While explaining Geoff had browsed in the bag and held out a book to Mark. It was in fact the borrowed book. Mark shakes his head at that. “Yeah, that´s the book. I can´t believe Aidan dropped it in a bag with sweaty sports clothes through.” <br />
Than Geoff made one mistake, as he moved over to Mark to hand him the book. Mark stood just next to Aidan the dustbin, and the moment Geoff was near enough, Mark grinned evilly at him as he said: “Aidan, swallow Geoff and the book.”<br />
It happened in seconds. While Aidan mentally screamed for Geoff to run away, Geoff looked confused at Mark. That was when Aidan´s tongue wrapped around his middle, and with a scream Geoff was pulled into Aidan. Even as Geoff was at least a head bigger than Aidan had been before his changes, he was easily swallowed into Aidan´s expandable insides. For Geoff it seemed rather tight, and Aidan felt full, but he knows that he can expand further if needed. Mark stood there laughing.<br />
“Well, that looked interesting. I hope he doesn´t feel to cramped in you, Aidan?” Mark said while still laughing. A light groan could be heard from inside Aidan, as Geoff hadn´t enough room to move. Mark moved over to the door and collected Aidan´s sports bag that Geoff had dropped there, and pushed Aidan´s muzzle open by standing on one of his claws. “Here, a little extra” he said and dropped the bag on Aidan´s tongue. There was a light “Ouch” to be heard as the bag hit Geoff before Mark let Aidan close again. Grinning cruelly, he hit the scale for Aidan. <br />
Aidan screamed in pain for being kicked yet again, and while he felt Geoff being absorbed, which felt really weird. Geoff himself couldn´t do anything as his body dissolved and merged with the dustbin. Only when he was completely absorbed he felt another presence around him. But he couldn´t do anything, not even think clearly enough to answer to Aidan, who was apologizing.<br />
Mark than decided he had to finish everything now. He could later decide what to do with Geoff. Maybe another useful object for his room? <br />
“I´m sure you will be really useful now, Aidan, and Geoff will be later as well, I guess. From now on, the laptop of Aidan Starns belongs to me, as Aidan Starns never existed as a living human being. Nobody will question why I talk to my dustbin called Aidan, and everything other he owned will change owners or vanish the moment I leave this flat. The dustbin Aidan will be transported to my room in a minute.” After that, Mark removed his comment of “Mark rules” from Aidan´s profile, saved it with a password and closed the laptop before he packed it. <br />
With a flash Aidan was ported away, reappearing in Mark´s room, beside his desk. He could do nothing but cry mentally for his fate and further apologize to Geoff. When Mark returned home, he smiled down at him evilly, but ignored him mostly for the evening. Occasionally he would drop some trash into Aidan, but didn´t empty him afterwards. Only before going to bed he used Aidan as his private toilet, and left him wide open, going to sleep. Aidan was crying the whole night mentally, both in pain for his muzzle to be this far open, as well as in disgust for what was in him. Geoff was by now unconscious.<br />
Mark would only close him in the mornings before leaving and hit the scale once after coming home, so Aidan had to endure being filled the whole time. Sometimes Mark would forgot to hit the scale and Aidan had to endure it even longer. Mark also edited Aidan´s profile one time to make sure Aidan would never grow attached to the smell and taste of whatever was in him, or any pain he felt. As Mark had still no idea of what to do with Geoff, he remained  unconscious trapped the whole time. Mark only made sure that nobody would miss Geoff, and that he remained alive absorbed in Aidan for as long as it took to decide.</p>
