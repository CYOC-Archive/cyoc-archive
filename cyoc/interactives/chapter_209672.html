<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The second Mark locked the door, Tom advanced towards the laptop, having enough intelligence to know whatever changed him and Aidan was on that thing. And he somewhat wanted to return the favor to Mark.<br />
Seeing Mark´s profile, Tom tabbed into it, and made one easy change, which would knock out Mark for some time, while his body remained frozen. He saved it just as Mark sat down on Aidan´s toilet, leaving him hanging in an uncomfortable way, not that he took notice being out of it. Most embarrassing would be that he was in the process of slipping his boxers down as well. So, Mark stood there, bend back to sit down, both hands grabbing the side of his boxers, thumbs inside, halfway past his ass.<br />
And while he was frozen, his insides weren´t. And with his control lost by being unconscious, he both pissed his boxers, as well as his hands. And what´s more, he also made a mess into it.<br />
That all went unnoticed by Tom, how next turned to Aidan´s profile, enabling him to speak human. After saving, he turned towards the man turned cat and called him. “Aidan, are you okay?”<br />
Aidan, for his part, didn´t know what happened around him, being in his curled up, shocked state. But when Tom spoke to him in his own voice, he lifted his head a bit. Not knowing that Tom had enabled him to speak, he thought he would only meow at him. “No, I´m not. I´m a cat. You just got my body.” Only then did he realize that he spoke normal again. “What did you do?”<br />
Tom looked at him as he answered: “I´m sorry, Aidan. I didn´t know what Mark wanted when he put me into that carrier and brought me here. But I wanted to be able to talk with you, hearing if you wanted any of this.”<br />
Aidan made big eyes at Tom, surprised that the former cat would ask his opinion. “No, I didn´t want to be a cat. Mark just discovered the program I had left unattended, made his input, and wouldn´t delete it. He froze my movements and went to get you, I guess. But why do you care for that, Tom?”<br />
Tom chuckled lightly. “You are my favorite human, Aidan. Mark isn´t always nice to me, but you never treated me bad. And just the way he said that I shouldn´t worry about you, made me even more curious. I guess you want your body back, then?”<br />
Aidan´s eyes seemed to have grown even bigger at that. “You would just change me back, and become a cat again?”<br />
“No, I have another idea, something to get back at Mark.” Tom said, grinning. “But you will be you again, if you want that.”<br />
“Yes, please Tom. Thank you for being so nice.” Aidan said, happy he could be himself again. Even if changing wouldn´t be nice, he would take it to be himself again.<br />
Tom opened Aidan´s profile first, and simply let the back-up file be loaded in. The only thing he added in the text input was: “Any changes should be pleasurable and not painful.”<br />
“Say, Aidan, what color do you want your eyes to be? Normal was hazel, but as mine are blue, you changed them before Mark switched us, right? Or do you want to keep my emerald ones? And what about the hair, black or ginger?” Tom asked, noticing the differences between his actual body and Aidan´s back-up.<br />
“I had hazel my whole life, but I would like them to the blue I chose before Mark was here. The hair change was Mark´s doing, so please make it black again.” Aidan answered from the couch. And Tom did just that to finish Aidan´s profile.<br />
Next, Tom pulled up his own file, alongside Mark´s, and copied most of Mark´s data over to himself. Knowing that Aidan is a bit of a lonely guy, he had decided on one change already. He made himself Aidan´s twin brother, and the program made a few alterations to the copied data to fit better with his family then Mark´s. He also added the same text input to himself as he had to Aidan, as he didn´t want to again feel pain changing.<br />
Satisfied with his own changes, Tom now opened up his own back-up file next to Mark´s actual one, and copied over his old data to his old owner. If Mark wanted to change their roles, he should include himself and not his friend Aidan. Here, he made a few text inputs. One was the opposite of the one of Aidan and himself, as he could see Mark had sadistic tendencies. So, he wrote in “Any changes should be more painful and less pleasurable.” That was also to get back at him for letting both Aidan and him change the way he did. He would have made it the other way if Mark hadn´t forced the pain upon them.<br />
Another input would make sure Mark wouldn´t be able to use the chronivac ever again, by making him unable to use it itself, as well as unable to use a computer or laptop in any way. He went so far as to make Mark unable to read anything on a lit-up screen. It would be funny to see Mark realizing he could theoretically read a book, but not anything on the screen of the laptop.<br />
The second last addition to Mark´s profile was one for obedience. “Obeys any command given by his owners Tom Starns and Aidan Starns, as long as it didn´t put his life in danger.” It would make sure they could keep him under control, but also keep him save of an ill thought command. Lastly, Tom put in a password, further locking any changes out from others then himself and Aidan, who would get the password later.<br />

<br />
Wanting to see Mark change, Tom put the changes to start when he hit start on the laptop, and let only the obeying command become active instantly, as well as waking Mark up from his unconsciousness in the bathroom. Turning to Aidan, who laid on the couch waiting, he said: “Okay, everything is set, now let our new cat come here first, before we start anything.”<br />
Aidan looked a bit confused at him. “Our cat? Why would Mark be our cat? Wouldn´t he be yours?”<br />
Tom chuckled as he saved the change for Mark to wake up. “I decided that I wouldn´t be a Romano, but instead your twin brother, Aidan. Therefore, he is our cat, as we live together. I hope you aren´t angry at that.”<br />
Aidan seemed to beam in happiness at that. “You … want to be my brother, my twin? Really? That´s good with me, Tom.”<br />
Just then, they heard a light crash from the bathroom, followed by an “Ouch”. Only seconds later, Mark yelled: “What the hell? How did I do this?”<br />
With a grin, Tom called: “You okay in there, Mark? Come here, I need your help.”<br />
Mark answered: “I need a minute or so, Tom.” But against his answer, Mark pulled up his messed-up clothes and walked out of the bathroom seconds later. “What is happening here? Why did I come out like that?”<br />
Aidan saw Mark´s soiled jeans and piss-dripping fingers and started laughing, followed by Tom as he realized what had happened. Mark was startled that Aidan´s laugh sounded human, and saw Tom at the laptop. Realizing what had happened, Mark made a dash towards Tom.<br />
Seeing this, Tom commanded: “Stop Mark, stand still” then he laughed again at Mark´s face of horror.<br />
Mark had stopped mid-step, frozen. Seeing both Aidan and Tom laughing, he asked in a voice between anger and fear: “What have you done to me?” He tried to struggle, but couldn´t fight off the command.<br />
Tom took a bit to calm down, but then he answered: “Well, you asked neither me nor Aidan if you can change us, so I thought I return that favor. And as a bonus, I made sure you would obey me and Aidan even before you start to change.”<br />
Mark´s eyes widened in fear. He had thought Tom would be happy with this. “Why?” he asked.<br />
“You haven’t treated me that well, but whenever Aidan came to visit you, he treated me much better. And seeing how you didn´t ask any of us, I decided on what to do. Aidan will turn back, I will turn into you, but be Aidan´s twin brother instead, and you will be our little, obedient pet cat, Mark.” Tom explained to Mark.<br />
Mark looked now shocked, or maybe horror-stricken. “You can´t do that to me, Tom. Please no.”<br />
“You didn´t even ask me and kept me unmoving and silent, Mark. I think Tom can do that, just like you did to us. Now strip” commented Aidan from the couch, and tried to control Mark like Tom could.<br />
Mark turned beet red in embarrassment as he stripped his soiled jeans and boxers down, stepped aside and pulled his shirt off, dropping it onto the mess. His socks went on top last, as his shoes stood back in the bathroom. He had taken them off before Tom had called him out. “Please, you can´t. I´m sorry for doing this. I should have asked.”<br />
“It´s too late now, Mark. You sent both of us through the pain of the change without a second thought. You will get the same treatment as soon as I start our changes.” Tom said to his old owner. “Now, I have made our changes in a sequence. Aidan will start, then I will change, and you, Mark, will be last. So, remain where you are and stay silent.” And with that said, Tom hit start on the laptop.<br />
Mark had wanted to argue more, plead for mercy, but now he was forced to keep quiet, could only watch what would happen to him.<br />
Aidan twitched once before he started to grow bigger again. It was nearly the same process as it had been for Tom before, only it wasn´t uncomfortable or painful, but pleasurable to change for him. Therefore, Aidan moaned as his body reformed from Tom´s cat-body to his own, human one again. His fur receded into his skin, leaving only the normal number of hairs on it. The black fur on his head grows a bit longer instead, returning him to his earlier hairstyle.<br />
His ears returned from triangular cat ears on top of his head to his normal round human one to the side. The snout shrunk back into his face, leaving only his nose standing out, while his eyes turned in a blink from emerald-green to sapphire-blue as he had wished for blue eyes, and Tom liked gem-colors. His paws bulged outwards, growing back into human hands and feet, absorbing the paw-pads into his palms and his soles. His fingers and toes returned to their old length, while the claws turned back into short trimmed nails.<br />
As his changes neared their end, his size nearly back to normal, his balls grew back in, letting Aidan moan even more. On the other side, his tail shrunk back into his body, leaving no trace of it remain. The second the changes finished, Aidan, much to his later embarrassment, shot a load of cum out of his regrown balls, the pleasure had been enough to tip him over his edge.<br />
Tom grinned at his soon to be brother as he shot his load, hoping he would do the same. He had no balls for nearly a year, so he would have enough reason to do so.<br />
Mark stood there, shocked that Aidan had so much pleasure changing, not knowing about it feeling good to him thanks to Tom. He thought about his planned changes, somehow hoping he could get a release like that for the change, not thinking about being neutered in the end.<br />
Tom waited to start his changes another minute, giving Aidan time to cool down a bit. The second Aidan noticed what exactly he had done, beside still being naked on his couch, let him get bright red. “Oh god, how could I let this happen, how embarrassing” he muttered shocked.<br />
“Hey, it’s okay, Aidan. It is possible I will do the same in a minute, and our cat doesn´t count for being embarrassed for. And it´s my fault, I made sure it wouldn´t be painful but pleasurable for us to change, so don´t worry.” Tom explained as he turned to start his own changes.<br />
“You did, Tom? Why haven´t you said so?” Aidan said, still red, as he used a few tissues form his side-table to clean his mess away.<br />
Tom grinned as he started his changes. “I guess I forgot to say, sorry.” Then, a shudder went through him, just like it had with Aidan. His own changes weren´t as big as Aidan´s, as he just turned from Aidan´s doppelganger, into a mix between him and Mark. He grew two inches, lost a few pounds, but that was most of it. His face reconstructed a bit to look like Mark´s, making his cheeks narrower, his nose pointier and his eyes smaller. The most visible change was his skin color, as he turned a shade darker through Mark´s skin-tone. It wasn´t enough of a change for Tom to release his load, and he felt the need to masturbate right there, not embarrassed in the slightest. Most likely a remnant of being a cat with no such problems.<br />
It didn´t take him long to get his shot out, hitting Mark right in the center of his chest, much to his disgust. Aidan laughed at Mark´s misfortune, and Tom basked in the afterglow of his first orgasm as a human, as well as the first in over a year since being neutered.<br />
Mark had to wait another five minutes, standing frozen and silent, cursing Tom for the cum slowly crawling down his chest and stomach, running down his own soft cock, before dropping from it like a leaking tap. It was both disgusting and embarrassing to him.<br />
When Tom came back to himself, he grinned at Mark, before starting his changes. “Let´s see how you like this, Mark.”<br />
Mark, too, shuddered as a sign of the changes starting. And then it felt as if his body was aflame, making him want to scream. All over his burning skin, his new fur-coat was emerging slowly. It was painful seconds to Mark, and to him it felt like hours, mentally exhausting himself by screaming the whole time.<br />
The burning stopped with his finished fur-coat, leaving him covered from head to his toes in Tom´s fur. Another scream would have left Mark as his tail grew in, as it felt like his spine was drilling a hole above his ass for it to emerge as a bone before being covered in fur. In reality, Tom and Aidan watched Mark just grew a bulge, which then expanded longer and longer while getting covered in fur at the same time.<br />
Following the tail, Mark´s hands and feet suddenly felt squished and squeezed rather hard, making him want to scream yet again. As if his fingers were under a few tons of weight, pressing them back into his palms. On the outside, his hands and feet turned into paws in seconds, gaining claws and paw-pads while losing size and dexterity. <br />
With his paws finished, an overall pain pressed onto his body, as his posture was changed next. Mark felt his bones breaking and bending in ways impossible for a normal life, and everything was felt painfully to him. His legs bend and reshaped, his back was pressed into fitting a quadruped being, not a human. <br />
A few seconds of relieve followed for Mark, making him hope this torture was over. Only to increase the pain he felt again when his head started to change. There, it felt like someone was pulling at his skin from all sides, trying to stretch his to tight skin. His ears were tugged upwards and remolded into triangular cat ears, his mouth drawn out into a snout, with his nose being pushed down into. His eyes stung as they changed from brown human ones into amber-colored cat-eyes.<br />
Now a full cat, just still human sized, Mark dreaded what would come next. All the pressure from before returned, now over his whole body, including his paws, head and tail. Mark felt squeezed smaller and smaller, slowly decreasing in size, until he was just the size Tom had been at the beginning. <br />
Now being sore all over, while still “standing” on his now hindlegs, Mark would yowl in pain if he could. But he was a bit relieved for the torture to be over. How could Tom and Aidan have enjoyed this?<br />
But he again was wrong, as there was still a last thing missing for him. And with a sudden pang down between his legs, his balls seemingly dropped off, evaporating into nothing before they could hit the ground. To Mark, that had felt as if someone had just kicked him into his genitals repeatedly with steel toe capped shoes.<br />
Seeing the changes had finished, Aidan asked Tom: “Do you think he enjoyed this as much as we did?”<br />
Tom chuckled. “No, he won´t, Aidan. You see, I was still angry for the pain we went through, so while I made our changes pleasurable, I made his extra painful. He was just unable to show it, being frozen and all. Now, Mark, you can move again, as well as make sounds. But you can´t attack me or Aidan as your owners, or anyone visiting us here. And you can´t run away, destroy anything with your claws or mark your “territory” by pissing or shitting around the flat. Understood?”<br />
Aidan winced at how easy Tom could leave Mark in pain. Yes, he was angry at Mark for everything, but making it extra painful for him? So, he slowly got up and moved towards Mark, who dropped down onto all four and then collapsed, quivering form the pain he had just felt. Without waiting for Mark to acknowledge him, Aidan sat down beside him and slowly massaged the man turned cat, easing the pain.<br />
Tom looked a bit surprised at him. “Why are you already easing him? Aren´t you still angry at him?”<br />
“Yes, I´m still angry, but I can´t see any animal being in pain. As much as I loathe what he did to us, even he hasn´t deserved extra pain from us. Maybe the same amount as us together, but not much more. And if he is to live as our cat, he shouldn´t be hating us too much, don´t you think?” Aidan answered, noting how Mark slowly stopped quivering and pressed back into his hands.<br />
Now Tom looked guilty. “Yeah, you are right. I guess I have overdone it. I´m sorry, Mark.” He, too, came over, knelt next to Aidan, and lightly petted Mark.<br />
Mark didn´t even notice Aidan until he started to slowly and carefully massage him, trying to ease his painful quivers. He had heard what Tom had said, ordering his behavior towards others, but had blended his surroundings out. It also eased him to know that Aidan defended him a bit, showing that he still cared about Mark. His body reacted on itself, pressing itself into Aidan´s hands, enjoying the massage. He mentally wasn´t sure if he should accept Tom´s apology, even if he sounded sincere. <br />
Soon, Tom sat down next to Aidan, still both naked, and both petting and massaging Mark, the cat, who enjoyed the attention he got now. It would be an interesting life for them, that´s for sure.</p>
