<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A sharp pain pulsed out of my right foot, I cramped up and fell.<br />
<br />
After the fall my mind had become clouded. A thick smog of confusion hung over me, leaving me wanting to mentally throw up whatever had caused it. I couldn’t focus on the things around me. I couldn’t even get a grasp of my own thoughts. Then a few seconds later, as quick as it had come the daze subsided, making me aware of my surroundings again. The smell of freshly mown grass prickled my nose as I opened my eyes and stared at the green carpet beneath me. Although my brain still felt muddled, I was able to push myself off the ground and sat up straight.<br />
<br />
I reached for my right shoe and took it off. Looking inside I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. I tried giving it a light tap, but to no avail. My foot also seemed fine, having checked it from top to bottom for a nasty cut or a jagged piece of glass.<br />
<br />
One of my friends John came over and asked me, “Mike, are you alright?” Still a bit confused I said, “Something stabbed me but I can’t find it now. I’m okay though. It doesn’t even hurt anymore.” There was something odd with my voice but I couldn’t quite place it. It sounded familiar, yet plain wrong at the same time.<br />
<br />
Whilst John came closer to check for any injuries I noticed that someone else had also fallen to the ground. He looked a lot like me same hair, same length and the same build. The other player turned around and after recognizing his face I began to panic. It was me? His appearance was dead-on, so who was I … What had John called me earlier?<br />
<br />
I began to look all over my own body. From the looks of it I had become a lot hairier, and the fact that my hair had changed to a darker color only made it more striking. My upper body had also bulked considerably, not to the physique of a professional athlete but enough to be a regular lifter during line-outs. And then it struck me, Mike.<br />
<br />
I glanced over at our teammates which only confirmed my suspicions. Mike wasn’t there or even better Mike was there but in my body. From all the people in the world you could’ve swapped me with, it had to be the queer. Did he do this to me? I don’t know how he would’ve done it but there’s a surefire way to find out.<br />
<br />
My train of thought got broken by John who told me he also couldn’t find anything. I turned my head to face him, he looked worried … maybe I had zoned out for just a little bit too long. Without saying anything, he reached his hand out and helped me get up. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jeff had come up to us and said to John “Everything seems to be fine. You should go to practice, I wouldn’t want you to be late because of us.” John didn’t trust the two of us together, knowing full well the disgust I had for Mike. He had every reason to stay but instead nodded and with a steady pace made his way to the playing field. We waited until John was far enough away to let us talk privately. In a strange way it also helped me calm down, quelling the rambling thoughts from earlier.<br />
<br />
I finally broke the silence by asking “Is that you Mike?” <br />
<br />
Although I already expected it, I felt at least a bit relieved when he said “Yes.” <br />
<br />
“Did you do this to us?” I asked<br />
<br />
He waited just a second before mumbling “Are you mad?” <br />
<br />
I thought to myself “Oh no, I always wanted to be a fag. This is just perfect.” I hope the creep doesn’t get any ideas because else this conversation will be the least of John’s worries. Trying not to loose it, I took a deep breath and relaxed. <br />
<br />
I felt tense and a bit anxious but I brushed it of like it was nothing by saying “I hope you don’t expect me to go have a gay orgy cause I’m not doing that.” as I stood up and made my way to the others. Although he somehow managed to get us into this, he seemed almost as clueless as I did about the situation.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t all bad because my new upper body strength was amazing. I could lift things I hadn’t been able to lift before. I also noticed we had swapped skills, catching the ball didn’t go as smoothly as it used to but I was able to tackle people like there was no tomorrow. Although I liked being agile, the positives weighed out the negatives. Besides having bigger muscles wouldn’t hurt when going out later that night.<br />
<br />
Practice began and went as usual, at least until it came time to do a line-out. It was my first time being a lifter as it was usually set aside for people with the right technique and the appropriate build. It meant that this time Mike would have his eyes on the ball instead of on my ass. I took my position and waited for my cue. And ... go! <br />
<br />
I ran towards Jeff, placed my hands on his rear and lifted him towards the ball. Something felt weird, not in a discomforting way but were my cheeks always this soft? Don’t get me wrong, they were still firm and muscled but some added fat made them nicely round and full, a real bubble butt. They felt so good, I could almost hug them ... grind my dick in them. Wait, no what was I thinking again? Suddenly Jeff’s face came to mind beautiful deep green eyes, a messy soft black quiff and a smirk that could melt the heart of millions. My dick twitched a little when I thought about him. It was so kissable, it was so dreamy, it was ... me! <br />
<br />
This sudden realization made the strength drain out of my arms as I dropped Jeff.  I was horrified. Not only did I like guys now but I was getting hard thinking about myself. In complete shock I looked over at Jeff who was laying on the ground in utter confusion. His furrowed brows revealed that he hadn’t the slightest clue of what was going on. How could he live like this? Did that cross his mind every time we were practicing? My identity had crumbled right in front of me, who was I if I liked guys instead of girls? A combination of fear and doubt had punched trough my ego and as tears built up at the corner of my eyes, I turned around and made a run for it.<br />
<br />
From behind me, I could hear coach yelling “Mike, Mike, what&#39;s the matter? Get back here.” There was no escaping, there was nowhere to hide. I had to live trough this. I kept running until soon enough I reached the goalpost at the edge of the field. Then I just collapsed, not out of exhaustion of course, but out of pure hopelessness. My hands barely holding up my head as I sat there, crouched against the goalpost, tears running across my cheeks. The rustle coming from the field’s grass blended well with the soft murmuring  of my teammates. There was finally peace and quiet, not only where I sat but also in my mind. I was determined to get trough this.<br />
<br />
A hand landed on my shoulder, it was coach who had finally caught up with me. He squatted down to make eye-contact and asked “Are you alright?” I wiped off any remaining tears with my arm and stammered “Yeah I’m fine, just something that happened at home.” He looked back at me compassionately and said “Seems a little more severe than just something. You don’t have to tell it to me, but know that I’m here for you bud.” I smiled a little to show that I was fine and coach continued “I think you’re done for today, you can go to the lockers.” <br />
<br />
As I made my way to the lockers the rest had already resumed practice, the coach gave a light nod and went back to instructing the team. The locker room door slammed shut behind me and I was back to thinking straight once more. What was I gonna do?</p>
