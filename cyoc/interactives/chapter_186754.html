<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luna looked much better at seeing Kellie and Roxie come home, which you figured was the real thing she was worried about. To a degree she had likely grown up with more attention to groups like the Wolf Hunters and probably understood the means and methods used to counter them. A lot of it often related to cooperation with local city, town, county, and even state agencies that dealt with the group. They could march and spew their hate vocally, as the First Amendment allowed for that, but if they took actions that took people&#39;s lives then the law would counter them. You figured that sort of coordination was likely what Kellie and Roxie shared with the other MILF-wolves and any regular werewolf in the area that they could contact. But they were still Luna&#39;s parents and that drove a lot of Luna&#39;s worries. Their return had easily put Luna in a better mood and you smiled at seeing her happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we should go to bed too?&quot; you asked her, &quot;I mean... tomorrow will be a big day, at least for me. New clothes, assorted registration work as a new MILF-wolf and all that sort of thing. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll need help with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll need to update mine to report that I&#39;ve reached the age where werewolves and MILF-wolves have their first transformation,&quot; Luna nodded, &quot;but for the moment, I have a better idea...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna then turned back to the television there on the entertainment center opposite the couch there in the living room. It showed a scene where the characters from the game Zoria were paused as they advanced through the massive halls of a castle. The center of the screen had the word &quot;pause&quot; flashing in white block letters, as Kellie and Roxie&#39;s return had come at a point where you and Luna could reach a save point in the game. Though at the same time, both of you had reached a point where you were actually close to beating the game. It wasn&#39;t impossible, as you and Luna had played through the game several times before while you&#39;d both been in high school. Thus you knew that the present castle level was the final level where Gregor the Greedy Dragon had Princess Zoria and Matilda&#39;s gardener&#39;s prisoner. Beating the dragon would release them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re pretty close to the end of the game,&quot; Luna gave a smile, &quot;why not finish it and see where our high score is. Might be interesting to see how we compare as MILF-wolves to where we were has &quot;normal&quot; humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the scores will be a bit lower,&quot; you commented as you held up one paw like hand with each brown furred finger tipped with a claw, &quot;we haven&#39;t lost all our dexterity... but it isn&#39;t as perfect as before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they&#39;re perfect,&quot; Luna smiled, &quot;but yeah... the PlayStation&#39;s controller was built more with human sized fingers in mind. But still... let&#39;s beat the game. Then we can go to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
You noted Luna stifling a small yawn as you both went around the couch to sit down again and pick up the controllers. Once you were both ready, you used one thumb claw to depress the start button and un-pause the game. From there, the characters on screen began to move, with Luna playing as Princess Zoria in green armor with a white skirt  while you were playing as Zoria&#39;s sister, Zesta, wearing white armor and a green skirt. The characters moved through the hallways and periodically jumped to crush sort of tinker-toy like knights that served the dragon or occasionally deploying the weapons that either character had. Zoria was often equipped in the games with a sort of magic/energy blaster that came from one hand while Zesta was equipped with a hatchet and a crossbow. This made dealing with Gregor&#39;s foot soldiers relatively easily as they moved up and down the halls.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... with as &quot;new&quot; as this game is, one would think they would have had more programing for options,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;you know, like we could open doors and find alternative routes to Gregor or rescue the gardeners without confronting the dragon and so on. You know... something more than following a linear path that they have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the system and game are old enough that a lot of what is in the newer systems isn&#39;t there,&quot; you commented back, &quot;at least not easily. And the game developers for Zoria aren&#39;t known for investing the funding for such immersion. That&#39;s present in some of the newer games on newer systems, but you have to remember that their capabilities are better than what my PlayStation has and thus the programing in those games needs to be higher.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna shrugged and the two of you moved along until you&#39;d moved your characters up to a large set of doors that seemed to just open as you approached. The doors opened to reveal Gregor, a large red scaled dragon with black wings filling a rather cavernous room with various tinker-toy knights around him. You and Luna laughed as Gregor voiced his monologue on how the gardeners would no longer be able to contribute to the stability of Zoria&#39;s &quot;kingdom.&quot; It was something that played to a lot of jokes from fans of the franchise that there were few princes for Zoria or Zesta to court and that the gardeners were doing more than tending to flowers, trees, and bushes. You also knew that there were websites that had rather erotic fan-fiction on the franchise in which Zesta and Zoria had had about half a dozen children with their gardeners through the course of the franchise&#39;s run as a game. The company that made the game, so far as you knew, ignored those fanfiction stories as they didn&#39;t effect the game and provided fans with other reasons to like the game.<br />
<br />
We then played through the boss battle. The tinker-toy knights were relatively easy to battle while dealing with Gregor, who frequently used his ability to fly to avoid direct hits or at least major ones. Luna was able to fire a few attacks that got him to crash and you when then follow with melee attacks with your character to whittle down Gregor&#39;s health-bar. Against two players, this was actually different tactics on Gregor&#39;s part. You&#39;d played through the game as a single player, and you&#39;d noticed that in a single player mode, Gregor played to his large health pool and keeping the player busy dodging bursts of flames while battling the tinker-toy knights. Against two players, Gregor played more to his fight abilities and forced you and Luna to have to coordinate your attacks together, but it did work as you and Luna seemed to catch on to the best strategy fairly well. Then, of course when Gregor was finally defeated, interestingly with one of his tinker-toy knights attempted to hack at Luna&#39;s character, the level ended and the two gardeners seemed to just appear out of nowhere and hugged their rescuers and the score screen came up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... our score was lower than in previous games,&quot; Luna quipped as she looked to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but we still won,&quot; you smiled back, &quot;and now to commemorate the win...&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point the game had moved to the save screen and you began running the curser through the letters to assign a file name for the game you and Luna had started earlier in the evening. It eventually read out: Won@sMILFwolves1. Luna smiled at that as the both of you then began finishing up. The disc was removed from the PlayStation and put back in its box. Luna moved the equipment so that it was next to the entertainment center and out of the way. It then finished as you then placed the box with the stack of other games. It was then that you actually managed a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that was fun,&quot; you managed to smile to Luna, &quot;you&#39;re feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Luna nodded and answered your yawn with one of her own, &quot;Mom and &quot;dad&quot; came back safe and we could still have fun with the game... and my mate will be with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll always try to be with you,&quot; you told her, &quot;you gave me such a wonderful gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you did the same for me,&quot; Luna replied, &quot;but we&#39;ll have a big day tomorrow. We should get to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we go and turn a light out before going upstairs,&quot; you commented off hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicki... we never turned a light on when we came down to play on the PlayStation,&quot; Luna laughed, &quot;in our wolven form... our night vision is THAT good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d... I&#39;d never noticed,&quot; you managed as you began to follow Luna back up the stairs and then down the hallway to the bedroom the two of you would share, &quot;but I&#39;m glad for it. It lets me see the beautiful woman you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna smiled and nodded as you then made your way to the bad. Both of you pulled the top blanket back and you climbed into bed together. You snuggled up to Luna as she then pulled the covers over the both of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now we&#39;ll live out our lives as beautiful women together,&quot; Luna smiled to you, &quot;while also being mature wolves at night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; you answered and nuzzled your nose to Luna&#39;s.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long after that the both of you fell asleep cuddled together.</p>
