<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For most of his life Mason had thought a girl with an attractive body was what he wanted, it wasn’t until he finished watching The Sun Mage III that he realized a girl into fantasy films just was much as he was was actually hotter.<br />
<br />
He had Janette agree to come back to his place and his goal wasn’t to fuck her. Instead all he wanted to do was watch the first two Sun Mage films with a girl just as passionate about them as he was.<br />
<br />
She was a perfect recreation of how he’d always dreamed princess Aurora had looked. She had been his fictional crush as a child and suddenly he was with an exact recreation of how he’d imagined she’d looked. She had the singsong voice he’d dreamed of, the outfit, and the silvery blonde hair. None of that mattered as much as Janette’s passion over a geeky fantasy film and they chattered about it nonstop as they rode the bus to his place, entered the house, and descended into the basement where he dug into the family movie collection and slipped the first director’s cut extended edition into the player complete with the mistake where you could see the sound guy in the reflection at the hall of ages.<br />
<br />
They began watching the first three and a half hour film and kept talking while it played, chattering about changes from the book, actor decisions, and all sorts of bits of trivia. She knew it all, they kept saying things in unison and laughing at the same jokes and moments, getting ready eyed at the right events, and having a beautiful back and forth conversation all about the fantasy film franchise. Then the second film started with the same conversations and laughter. Mason got lost in that evening, it was the best evening of his life, and when the clock struck for six in the morning he showed Janette out without even a thought of bedding her.<br />
<br />
She was back the next evening for the director’s commentary and Mason’s parents were absolutely stunned when he opened the door for this absolute princess of a girl. She’d she’d her cosplay but still looked like Princess Aurora just in regular attire instead of a long flowing dress. She somehow looked better wearing a fantasy-con New York tee, jeans, and a button down pink short sleeve shirt with her hair braided back in a simple and loose style that kept the long silvery blonde locks out of her face.<br />
<br />
They sat in the basement again listening to the director’s commentary and discussing their favourite trivia and how great the trailers always were. It was a heavenly evening that wound late into the night again, and this time his parents insisted she stay over due to how late it was.<br />
<br />
He spent pretty much all night with her talking about the movies and woke up again not even thinking about sleeping with her. Somehow fucking this girl seemed one compared to just talking to her. He wasn’t sure what was going on, maybe he was in love.<br />
<br />
They went to see the third film in theatres again the next day, only stopping once between his place and the theatre so Janette could shower and get changed. She was in her bedroom and she wandered around in her underwear in front of him and yet he still thought it was cooler to just talk about the films with her.<br />
<br />
They met for coffee during the week, he lay on her bed listening to her read poetry, and days turned into weeks. He suddenly realized they were dating two months in and didn’t even really care. Janette was amazing, he loved talking to her about movies and listening to her rave about fantasy books she’d found on discount in a second hand bookstore. They ate dinner together, saw movies, and talked during Chem class so much that the professor had to split them up.<br />
<br />
She then showed him the most intimate part of her life, her own writing. She was writing her own fantasy novel and felt comfortable enough around him to show it off. Fucking her didn’t cross his mind again until school had finally let out for Summer and they got their grades back.<br />
<br />
They were in his basement like normal, celebrating a good semester by watching The Sun Mage trilogy again when she looked at him and he looked at her, everything seemed to click as they made eye contact, he was dazzled by her appearance and she blushed in such a heavenly way that it made his heart flutter.<br />
<br />
He reached four and brought her face close to hers, they started to kiss on the couch and it kept going, he didn’t want to break it off and she didn’t seem to want to either. They slowly pushed a little further, he touched her back, she touched his chest, he then hefted her shirt over her head and she clung to him happily, his fingers unclamped her bra, she began to feel up his dick, and before long they were nude on that couch while the first sun mage played in the background.<br />
<br />
She moaned in pleasure as their foreplay got more and more intense and she didn’t resist when he started angling his dick towards her open vagina. She just kissed him harder and harder before he slid his penis into her for the first time and felt her shudder.<br />
<br />
He began to slide in and out of her while she wrapped her legs around him pulling him closer and began to kiss him more passionately. They writhed on that couch together and she was so hot and receptive that it didn’t take long for his semen to erupt from his cock and fill her body with his juices. She shuddered and moaned, biting her lip in pleasure and clinging onto him tightly, not allowing him to pull out of her body.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been waiting for this,” she panted, gazing up at him with loving blue eyes straight out of his dreams. “Don’t let it end yet.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t,” he promised as his dick started to go erect again and he started to hump her once more. She smiled and moaned happily, her body shaking with each lurch of his hips, her breasts bouncing hypnotically with every thrust and her hair splayed around her head.<br />
<br />
“Keep it... oh... keep it up,” she requested as his pounding became more rhythmic. “Yeah, that’s the spot, just like... oh.... just like t-that.”<br />
<br />
He came again and she squealed In delight, blushing hard and giggling like a schoolgirl at the feeing of his cum filling her cavity.<br />
<br />
“You good?” He asked and she brushed some hair from her eyes, releasing her legs from around his torso and allowing him to pull out.<br />
<br />
“I love you,” she panted, laying there with a glistening of sweat on her body and all her curves on display for him to see. <br />
<br />
“I love you too,” he replied while blushing himself. “You’re perfect, you know that?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not,” she replied modestly.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m being honest,” Mason replied as he stared down at her lovingly. “I’m gonna pop a ring on that finger one of these days, I can’t imagine going back to life without you around.”<br />
<br />
“R-really?” She asked meekly.<br />
<br />
“Really,” Mason replied. “Now, do you wanna get back to watching the director’s commentary or...”<br />
<br />
“Eh, this is the part where they talk about the eleven village, it’s the worst part,” Janette admitted. “How about we instead try another position.”<br />
<br />
“I like where your head’s at,” Mason grinned before his girlfriend presented her ass to him and he mounted her from behind.</p>
