<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Everyone come and look to see the results of Kat’s first spell. Per family tradition, she casted a spell on Dan that would transform him into his inner self. Some of us here are results of this tradition too. Within a minute after Kat comes out in front, we will see the final transformation. Kat, come up here!&quot; Dan hears his uncle say. Though he looks like a gnome.<br />
<br />
Kat walked up to the front, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;60 seconds!&quot; Dan heard a yell.<br />
<br />
Lilly walked in, holding him. Her upper torso was naked, but she was covering herself with a towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;50 seconds!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then lifted him up in the air, where he could see an entire crowd of witches and magical beings staring at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;40 seconds!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan’s limbs, now fused together intro straps, had Lilly’s arms go through them, his former arms now resting on her shoulders. Dan’s former legs were instead wrapped around her back, where they clasped together.<br />
<br />
&quot;30 seconds!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan’s facial features seemed to disappear completely. He had no way to blink, only being able to stare forward at the crowd. He had no way to breathe or talk, or even move his enormous mouth. His flattened head, divided into two shapes, slowly began moulding itself into a pair of cups as Lilly’s breasts pushed into him. This felt relieving, as he was feeling very tight around Lilly’s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;20 seconds!&quot;<br />
<br />
The transformation started to slow down. His straps were getting shorter and pulling him closer an closer against Lilly&#39;s breasts, which in turn pushed them further into his mouth, stretching his cups into the appropiate size for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;10 seconds!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan struggled to move. He could shift slightly in various places, but there wasn’t much he could do anymore. As each second passed, he was able to move less and less, and felt more and more of a fuzzy feeling throughout his body.<br />
<br />
The straps were as tight as they could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;5, 4, 3, 2!&quot;<br />
<br />
His body stopped stretching, perfectly cupping Lilly&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;1!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan lost all ability to move. It was replaced with that feeling when your arm falls asleep. Except everywhere in its body felt it, and all mobility was lost. Dan was left fearful, for his future and what has happened to him. Worst yet, he couldn&#39;t scream, having a mouthful of boobs muffling his attempts at emitting sound. If he could even emit sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so, Dan’s inner self is… His crush’s bra! Here, Lilly, Dan, is a mirror so you can see how you two look. Spoiler alert, very very beautiful!&quot; Kat gleefully said, looking happier than Dan has ever seen her before. She snapped her fingers and a mirror appeared in front of her.<br />
<br />
Dan saw its crush’s beautiful lace bra, a delicate white garment, beautifully decorated and perfectly wrapped around her boobs. It wondered if it was also a push-up bra, or if Lilly&#39;s breasts had always been that big.<br />
<br />
“Wow, I love it so much!” Lilly said, testing the straps. Its fabric still had senses, but was far more sensitive to movement than before. Dan felt tension of being pulled, a nice twinge of pain, but it was nothing in comparison to the sensation of being bloated with her ample chest. The taste of her smooth and creamy skin, in combination with the huge and soft weight her tits posed, were exactly what he had been craving since lunch.<br />
<br />
“You can stay for a while, until your big party later,” Kat told Lilly.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I would love to!” she said, putting on a small top to cover herself a little, but not too much.<br />
<br />
Throughout the party, Dan was trying to come into terms with what happened. Earlier today it was a human with a future. Now it was just a bra for Lilly.<br />
<br />
A little while later, Kat walked back up to Lilly. “You have to come over here, my mom sensed some magic inside of you, we’re going to try to awaken it.”<br />
<br />
Kat grabbed Lilly’s hand and walked her across the party. Every time she took a step, Dan&#39;s entire being shook and bounced, disorienting it but also pleasing it intensely. It loved the jiggling it felt inside of its mouth. Dan was also starting to feel Lilly’s sweat absorbing into it, though the sweat didn’t really feel like anything like Dan expected.<br />
<br />
When Lilly met Dan’s mom, Dan’s mom smiled. “No wonder Dan’s inner self was connected to you. You’re so pretty, and your magic deep in you is stronger than I have ever seen before. It’s rare for a woman to even have any to begin with!”<br />
<br />
“Thank you!”<br />
<br />
Dan’s mom tapped Lilly on the forehead. Magical energy rushed through Lilly, and even Dan felt some of it. “It will fully manifest in about a year. When it happens, come back over here, and we can teach you how to use magic.”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely. That would be wonderful!”<br />
<br />
“And make sure to wear Dan too. It looked really supportive, it would be a shame if I couldn’t see it anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Trust me I’m going to be wearing it a lot!”<br />
<br />
“In that case…”<br />
<br />
This time Dan’s mom touched Dan, right on one of the straps that revealed itself from the top. More magical energy sunk into Dan and any sweat that it absorbed disappeared.<br />
<br />
“This spell will remove any dirtiness, wetness, or anything that’ll stop you from wearing it as often as you want. Feel free to wear it as often as possible!” Dan’s mom said.<br />
<br />
“Consecutive days in a row?”<br />
<br />
“Yep! Theoretically you wouldn’t have to take it off at all, for as long as you live, which with magic, is a long time…”<br />
<br />
Soon enough, it was time for Lilly to leave Kat’s party and go to Clair’s party.</p>
