<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had spent 3 days at home skipping school and other activities as the June condom became to big to lug about. Aside from sleep, food and his refectory period between orgasims he&#39;s done nothing but blow load after load into his rubber girlfriend! <br />
<br />
June&#39;s face still seated on the outside of the condom gave little motions of expression. Early it was easy to read, but now her face was stretched out over a yard in diameter micro expressions completely obscured by the scale.<br />
<br />
On the forth day of his jerk-a-thon Jeff realizes he couldn&#39;t live line this. The mattress sized cum filled condom beneath him made movement imposable since taking it off would unfulfill June&#39;s wishes and his own desires. <br />
<br />
He thought long and hard about what he could do, and then like a bolt of lighting striking him he knew his solution! <br />
<br />
He pivoted on the sack of cum he lay on over to the computer and started up the program again. He first made edits to June to better serve his plan then set to his own body. After an hour of cross checking changes so everything was just right he pressed enter. <br />
<br />
The program ran and after a short time dinged a note signaling everything was ready.<br />
<br />
Jeff sitting on June the cum waterbed started jerking of for the millionth-some time and felt the process start. <br />
<br />
As he started to cum he new it was working, after jerking it for so long he knew he was good for maybe 10 seconds of climax but this one lasted well over that. As he came the flow didn&#39;t stop! He kept shooting his load almost like he was pissing the thick seed. Still pumping with his one hand he looked to his free one watching it wither ever so slightly with each blast of his cock.<br />
<br />
Little by little Jeff shrank into his body, all the while laughing in exsticy &quot;Haha! It&#39;s working its working! Haha!&quot; His fingers melted into his hand, then his hand into his arm. Even after his right hand disappeared around his cock he didn&#39;t need it. His dick was like a faucet pouring the mass of his body into the June condom. <br />
<br />
His feet curled into his legs and then his legs into his torso! Just like he had done to June in the start of all this last year he was but a fuck nugget. A dick on a torso with a head! Soon though his torso began to pinch and get sucked down his dick until his head sat at the top of the condom opening around his dick. <br />
<br />
He laughed like a maniac until it faded into a gurgling sound, his face turning milky white and slumping into a fluid that fell into the condom opening.<br />
<br />
As a spurt of bubbles lifted to the surface of the opening to brine the condom suddenly twisted and tied itself into a knot, preventing it from spilling just in time. <br />
<br />
Jeff now floated aimlessly in a milky cloud. Not feeling his body but feeling the container he rested in. Small pockets of himself swirling about its confines making it shift about. <br />
<br />
*mmmmmm haaaaa* he heard echo inside himself, the families voice of June reverberating through him. The sound of her voice he&#39;d not heard in days made him feel warm and fuzzy inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff just added another load, yes! Give me more! That last one was huge! Keep it coming big boy! More!&quot; Jeff heard these thoughts all around him, it was a little disorienting.<br />
<br />
&quot;June? Can you hear me? June! It&#39;s Jeff!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? You sound different? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing love, I&#39;ve filled you all I can. I&#39;m the cum inside you now! We&#39;re one being just like before, just like in the bag!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff that&#39;s wonderful! I love this so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear, cuz it gets better! Can you still see from your face?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so, but I&#39;m so stretched out my vision is like lolling into a glass bowl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just watch dear, let me work&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jeff concentrated on his fluid essence he shifted his mass about the June ballon condom...<br />
<br />
Outside the milky thick fluid of the Jeff cum/June condom the mass of spunk violently twisted and bloated. Different shapes and figures pressing out against the rubber walls as the mass shrank rapidly. More definition and control see coming to the different figures that pushed against the condom of June to form rough limbs of a human!<br />
<br />
As they shrank they became more refined, toes, muscle shapes, legs arms, a head. The whole spectical looked like a blowup doll exploding in reverse. As the face took shape June could see clearly again, her distorted head shrunk over the head of the body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? What just happened, I feel less taut. full, but not stretched?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok June, ill explain. I&#39;m the sexy jizz inside of you now. I gave myself control over my fluid, but I&#39;m still fluid. I still need something to give me shape, a force to press against and contain me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; June drew out getting the general picture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your the condom that contains me, so I can press against you and make shapes. Like limbs or a head.&quot;<br />
<br />
June was starters to see a rubbery hand dart up to her face and articulate the the fingers.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued &quot;but I&#39;m the force, I&#39;m in control. Your more like a shell. You can&#39;t act, but your face is on the body, so you will have to make expressions and such&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This way I&#39;m still filled... And you can fill me however you like!&quot; June said putting the pieces together and building with excitement!<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to the mirror, I wana see my new condom body!&quot; She cried out!<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gave shaky steps on his fluid body, managing force and movement proved more tricky then expected but he managed to get to the mirror.<br />
<br />
June gazed upon her reflection. Her body was like that of a blowup doll not unsurprising though her joints were well detailed along with her fingers and facial indentations. The head was bald obviously and her face superimposed on the head, with indents matching her eyes and nose and ears. As long as no one looked to close and she didn&#39;t try to talk, it might be passable for real.<br />
<br />
Her chest was flat and at her crotch sat the tied off end of the condom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right! Boobs!&quot; Jeff said inside them. The hands came up to her chest and June felt the familiar warm sensation of expanding and filling as two breasts filled in rapidly ascending from A-cups to G-cups! Then they stretched off her chest and sagged to the floor with a creaking sound and a hollow *slush*. <br />
<br />
June didn&#39;t hear any of this over her own moans of pleasure! The very act of expanding and being pushed within was like a supernova orgasim! <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry June, this body force shaping stuff I&#39;d hard...&quot; Jeff breathed in disappointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! More! Stretch me more! Fill me! Bloat me! This is amazing Jeff!&quot; She begged him!<br />
<br />
&#39;This is going great&#39; Jeff thought. &#39;Can&#39;t disappoint my lady, guess I should...&#39;</p>
