<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendra spent a few minutes staring at herself in the mirror, in awe of the changes she wrought upon herself.  A building pressure disrupted her trance state and she turned to the toilet.  Unlike every other time in her life that she had needed to go, she felt the pressure twice - once in the normal place and once... further back.<br />
<br />
It took Kendra a few tries to figure out how to sit on the porcelain throne with her changed body.  She settled for sitting sideways across it - her front legs crammed into the space between the toilet, and the wall with the paper roll.  Her lower torso bent at a nearly painful angle to avoid the cabinet and sink: the way she had to contort herself had actually left her back legs pointing a different direction than her front legs.  One head giggled at the absurdity of it all while her other head winced at the discomfort.<br />
<br />
As far as actual release, she was scared that when she clenched she might accidentally release at both ends... But she had no choice other than to try.  To her relief (both metaphorical and literal), she was successful in only releasing at one end.  A minute later she had emptied her front bladder and carefully extricated herself from the cramped space.<br />
<br />
It took her only a moment to figure out how to use the toilet with her rear legs - the shape of her body at her rear legs was much more analogous to that of a typical human, and thus much easier.  A minute later she quietly congratulated herself on figuring out how to use such a simple and commonplace device and turned her focus to the shower.<br />
<br />
Thankfully her shower was a combination tub and shower, which left her with plenty of room to stand.  It was an odd design installed by the previous owners and had 2 shower heads and water dials - one set at each end of the stall.   She turned on the water at one end and instinctively moved her heads to intercept the stream.  Her skulls collided and both heads winced in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow&quot; &quot;Ow&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra&#39;s heads turned inward and she looked at herself.  It seemed the change had increased the flexibility of her necks, as she was able to turn her heads to look directly at her other head.  But there wasn&#39;t enough space between her heads for both to be facing inward without colliding.  She hadn&#39;t realized she was doing it when setting up the change earlier, but she had managed to space her heads just far enough apart that her lips were separated by only millimeters.  Her noses gently collided and forced each head to tilt in a complimentary direction.<br />
<br />
Even though Kendra had seen her face in the mirror many times before, there was something different about seeing it directly through another set of eyes.  Her features looked... appealing, sexy, and inviting.  A thought surfaced in one of her minds:<br />
<br />
<i>Is this what narcissism feels like?</i><br />
<br />
Ever so gently Kendra leaned her heads inward and her lips met.  The sensations of kissing and being kissed in that way simultaneously were novel and pleasant.  She had never had a boyfriend, let alone kissed a boy.  And a girl, well... According to her parents that was out of the question, and she hadn&#39;t dared to experiment.<br />
<br />
But these dual sensations of kissing twice were nice.  She liked them.  Maybe a little more than liked them.  She pressed deeper into the kiss and soon her tongues met and danced.  Without even realizing what she was doing, 2 left arms reached up and lightly squeezed both her upper and lower left breasts.<br />
<br />
An unfamiliar heat rose in her groins.  Kendra had never given in to masturbation before, but she had never felt the drive as strong as it was now.  It was too strong to resist, and besides, she didn&#39;t want to resist.  She had become curious about many things, and her reshaped body was the vessel through which she was going to discover.  Following instinct, her right arms reached down and each slipped a finger into her front slit.  <br />
<br />
A surge of pleasure washed over her and she stumbled backwards.  Her butt collided with the wall at the other end of the stall, and she felt the protruding handle of the water dial against her butt cheek.  An idea blinked into existence and she carefully maneuvered her rear legs to a better vantage point.  Even while one head was focused on that, her other head was still actively kissing, groping, and exploring her virgin canal.<br />
<br />
Carefully she climbed her rear legs up on the sides of the tub and positioned her rear groin just over the water dial&#39;s upward-facing handle.  Then slowly she lowered her rear down until she felt the warm metal of the dial&#39;s protruding handle.  She shifted a little until it was at just the right spot, then slowly lowered herself more.  The handle quickly penetrated and stretched her rear pussy as she lowered her rear groin around it.<br />
<br />
The sudden surge of sensations at having a foreign object inserted into her shattered her concentration and Kendra&#39;s rear legs lost their footing and slipped.  Her body slid down and encapsulated the rear handle in a mere second.  Both of her minds exploded in fireworks and it was only her self kiss that prevented her from screaming out in a mixture of surprise, pain, and pleasure.<br />
<br />
Through the rapidly growing haze of pleasure she scrambled to get a solid footing again with her rear legs.  Every time she tried, her rear pussy lifted a little off the handle - not pulling it out fully, but no longer supporting the weight of her lower torso on it.  Then she invariably slipped and rammed her pussy back down on the handle.  It was on only the 2nd attempt that her aim shifted from freeing herself to instead gaining as much pleasure possible from the bizarre situation she found herself in.<br />
<br />
The combination of the fingers exploring her front pussy and the orgasmic pleasure emanating from her rear pussy quickly caused an orgasm to bloom in her front half.  Each mind felt both orgasms simultaneously, and she experienced the world through her two minds simultaneously.  Kendra&#39;s consciousness dimmed under the pleasure of feeling 4 orgasms at once.<br />
<br />
Her front legs gave out and she slumped to the tub.  Her rear groin was still hooked on the water dial&#39;s handle which caused her rear legs to hang loosely and her lower torso to slope upwards.  Her upper torso reclined backwards against her lower torso and first one mind flickered to a bliss-induced unconsciousness, then the other.</p>
