<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was as the man promised, a week later, seven days and donkey Jim was standing near to the front gate while pondering when he saw Mister Carter drive his sports car to a stop in the farm driveway.<br />
<br />
Jim felt the sense of excitement from seeing first the man come from out his vehicle, as then from the passenger side came out the Genie, he dressed the same as the day he sent Jim into donkey exile.<br />
<br />
Mister Carter walked faster than the Genie, he likely eager to hear as learn what Jim would wish from thee Genie. &quot;Good day to you Donkey Jimmy, oh do not give it a worry that we might be seen or overheard, the Genie has arranged for our meeting as done it complete privacy. Well there Genie, what do you think of Jimmy, is he not still a fine as healthy looking Jack stud donkey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh of course my Master, Jimmy asked to remain young and as handsome as possible for being a male donkey. He wished for an exceedingly long lifespan equal to 12,000 months, or a thousand years being a young Jack-stud donkey in use as a breeder sire with jennets and mares, both horses and ponies alike.&quot; The Genie replied, as much then giving a friendly and appreciative eye-wink at Jim for all he had accomplished during the first 15 years of his preferred form and lifestyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then there Jimmy boy..., or should I say Jimmy the donkey Jack, so what do you wish to ask of the Genie for your two specially granted wishes?&quot; Mister Carter asked, as Jim being mute of words and only able to bray of make equine groans, he began to scrawl with his right fore hoof in the corral sand his wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me Sir,&quot; so said the Genie, as he swirled his hands with palms up as facing at the donkey head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah..., oh hey, yes and thank you Genie, as to talk and tell what I wish would be much easier than writing in the loose sandy ground.&quot; Jim said, as Mister Carter stepped back and away from both the corral fence and the Genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;After your visit a week ago I had much time to think about what to ask, as wish for the good Genie to grant me. Firstly, I wish to state that I have decided to remain as I am, me a donkey and Jack stud herd sire for the 985 years of beastly life I still have coming from my first ever wish to a Genie. I know what Mister Carter said and as well what Genie told me when I was changed into a donkey by choice, as that my parents with time would forget as lose all remembrances of me ever being alive, and as their son.<br />
<br />
I am as happy being a horny Jack donkey as might any born male stud donkey could be from having a daily schedule of me breeding with from one to four equine females. In as much I have gained some appreciation for the growing coven of zoophiles what come by night on the weekends and take me by stealth from my barn stall to their grotto. Yes, a gully of privacy  up in the far hills where they use me from midnight to dawn, as they fondle and or suckle on me, my maleness, giving different thrills that my equine lovers never do for me. <br />
<br />
Now as to my first wish of two wishes the Genie can grant to me, and that is I wish my body odor would not draw to me the pest insects what bite or bother my face. Maybe to your sense of surprise, as to the flies what land on me, as from my withers to rump, their walking on me tends to tickle. I like the flies to come and walk on as around, and lick clean my protruding puckered donkey anus. I enjoy the sensations as the flies clean my erect boner penis, from the dried scales of spent semen, and the equally caked as dried vaginal slime buildup coating my cock after every mating session. As other than the larger horseflies what can bite, the smaller bottle flies are as much my fun friends as one way of retention of good health.<br />
<br />
I am happy by being a donkey, even if as one of the coven women will remark, my personage is a crude beast. I know my muzzle looks mealy, my lips large as thick, and my cock contoured when erect has a primeval lacking appeal. A few of the coven women have read stories on the Internet about women who did belly-riding of stallions. I get two or three each year what come to the coven orgy prepared with a belly sling for them to get me to vaginally mate with their hot bodies, and not thrust too deep, or too harshly as cause fatal rupture to a womanly abdominal region. You know, they thought to try it by lying spread-eagle across blanket covered hay bales and have me mount the bales, while two women aid with directing my cock inside the hornier female human. Just six inches of my donkey cock slid inside and then flared, as filled the woman&#39;s womb with cock head before the torrent of my semen gushed out and bloated her so full she looked as if five months pregnant. It is some of my more sordid fun to hear the coven women scream or cry as their womb and vagina stretch to let them feel what mares feel.<br />
<br />
My second wish is two fold but as one if Genie would agree. Part A, I would like to keep the ability to talk using my donkey mouth and tongue working in coordination for needed conversing. As well part B, when the farm owner might die, I would wish to become the property of a kindly woman, she being someone I could speak with, as assure my longevity as a special animal, similar to the TV program horse named Mister Ed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister Carter looked to the Genie as did Jim, they seeing the smile of a magical Genie showing admiration of a human transformed into a brute animal donkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope your smile is one of agreement, &quot; a happy, horny donkey spoke as to a Genie willing to be kind to some human once young and foolish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am more than willing, and shall when the time comes assure you that your next owner shall be of magical folk. As what you ask for is from now and unto the end of year 985 as to your liking donkey form and lifestyle.&quot; The Genie said, as Mister Carter seemed upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jimmy, you surprised me, you wishing as liking to remain a donkey animal and live on your life of lust and sexual pleasuring.&quot; Mister Carter as said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why not, have you not found manly male pleasures by fornicating with your wife, or some significant other?&quot; A talking donkey then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I agree my Master with he my former Master, as he, Jim is living what he wished for to be his lifestyle. If his is the desire to let his genitals govern his future, so what, as you would have gaining of wealth and prominence as guiding your future endeavors. For the moment this land you call as America remains free, offering many freedoms, one of which for Jim was his delight for feeling sexual pleasures having a large and long cock sunk deep inside the hot body of a equine female feeling her estrus. Is he wrong for giving up everything human for being original and following his style of Kama Sutra.&quot; Asked as said the Genie, with Jimmy smiling of admiration the best he could with thick lips and equine teeth.</p>
