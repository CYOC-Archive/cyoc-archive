<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You remembered having a very lovely dream. Somehow, you'd turned into a fairy and found Kaylee after she had been missing for roughly a year. She was also a fairy and she'd offered to help you adjust and pick up your relationship from where it ended. It ended with the two of you having sex as fairies inside her apartment in an old oak tree in the park. And then your eyes fluttered open...<br />
<br />
Your eyes opened slowly and calmly. As you woke up you found an arm wrapped around you and a feminine hand clutching at something soft on your chest. Lifting up the blanket you were under you looked down to see the hand softly touching your right breast. You felt yourself blush at the size of the breast and then rolled over to see that the owner of the hand was none other than Kaylee.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was real,&quot; you said softly.<br />
<br />
Kaylee's eyes then began to flutter as you spoke. After a few moments her eyes fully opened and she gave a loving smile to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Ada,&quot; Kaylee smiled, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dreamed I turned into a fairy and found you again,&quot; you replied, &quot;then I wake up to find that my dreams came true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you became a fairy or that you found me?&quot; Kaylee questioned, sounding slightly playful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly that I found you,&quot; you shrugged, &quot;but last night... last night was enough to make me feel that being a fairy isn't a bad thing... quite the opposite, in fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good to hear,&quot; Kaylee replied, and sat up, &quot;come on, we have a big day today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A big day?&quot; you inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, to start your lessons,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;you've figured out the basic instinctual things a fairy can do, such as flying and we covered basic anatomy and reproduction last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our... our... our flowers?&quot; you asked, &quot;that fairies are... are flowers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't really know,&quot; Kaylee said with a slight blush, &quot;we are magical creatures, yes, and according to the stories I've heard, the first fairy was born out of a flower that had been touched by the magic of creation... according to the stories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee opened one of her drawers and pulled out a new flower petal dress and began to put it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I'd suppose you could say fairies are flowers, but that's rather simplistic,&quot; Kaylee explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would explain how a largely female society has babies,&quot; you commented, &quot;Don't flowers have male and female parts?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded. While she finished putting on her clean dress you looked down to not only see your chest again but the two dresses that you and Kaylee had been wearing the night before. As you looked back you saw your naked form in the mirror. The bud of your flower hidden under the outer lips of your new genitals and your breasts stood proudly on your chest. There wasn't much in the way of sag and you felt your nipples looked rather perky. You then managed to look back to Kaylee who was straightening her dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I wear?&quot; you asked, &quot;the dress you gave me yesterday is dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where is the guy that would wear the same shirt for a week if had less then two food stains on it?&quot; Kaylee teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was only because the shirt was for my favorite team and they were going to the playoffs,&quot; you protested, &quot;it was my lucky shirt... and besides, he grew two breasts and lost his masculinity. As a girl now... shouldn't I be more self conscious about what I wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have too... there were days when I didn't change clothes... though I was sick and wasn't seeing anyone,&quot; Kaylee commented.<br />
<br />
You found yourself giving a depressed sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;we can order you some dresses that will fit. In fact...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee then pointed to the crystal she'd used to turn off the &quot;lights&quot; the night before. A small orb of pink light appeared and flew to the crystal and that then disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just sent an order with your measurements to the tailors,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;You may have to wait a little bit this morning or at least make due with the dress from yesterday. And it isn't too bad. You didn't get it dirty or anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You picked up the dress you wore the night before. It looked clean enough as far as your old male mind thought. You weren't quite sure on what you really thought now that you were female and a fairy. Did the same rules of gender stereotypes apply? Or was fairy society totally different from human society?<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I'll make due with it for today,&quot; you sighed, &quot;How many new dresses did you order?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough to get us through the week,&quot; Kaylee smirked, &quot;toward the end, you'll get your first lesson in the laundry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny,&quot; you shook your head and put the purple flower petal dress on again. Once it was on, and you felt two interior petals curl to form underwear for you, you turned to what had initially started the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what will my lessons today be on?&quot;  you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly some basic introductions to magic,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;I can show you all the fairy rings in the park and explain what each one does...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about casting spells and making all the fairy dust appear?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're just beginning,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;we won't get that far today... and it isn't fairy dust. A fairy's magic is generated and is visible in small particles of light. It's usually the same color as their hair, which in my case is now pink and yours will likely be golden... but it takes a lot of skill and focus... too little control, and you'll do something you'll regret later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, today... if we go in that direction, we'd only get the theory down?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll probably cover a lot of the theory behind fairy magic with the tour,&quot; Kaylee explained, &quot;don't worry. There's a lot to cover and it will take time, but once you start to get the hang of it, you'll pick it up fairly rapidly. Sarah and a couple of the other former humans do agree that there is a great deal of natural learning and acceptance that goes on over time. As the new fairy &quot;get's used&quot; to her new body, or in your case, to HER body... and things seem to become more and more natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this mean I'll forget being Adam or the good times we had together as humans?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kaylee said firmly and pulled you into a reassuring hug, &quot;Sarah hasn't forgotten her life from when she was a human male. I haven't forgotten being a human woman. You'll never forget being Adam. But in time, your instincts will prefer to go by what you are now... Ada.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hugged Kaylee back. Some of that might already be going on already, if what you remembered from the night before was accurate, and while it unnerved a part of your mind, a part of you was also glad for it. You'd be with Kaylee, and that was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I guess we should get breakfast and get going,&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kaylee nodded, &quot;a great many lessons to begin... all to help you be the best fairy you can be.&quot;</p>
