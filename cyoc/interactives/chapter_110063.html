<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being in the presence of a beautiful mermaid everyday was starting to get to me. She still wouldn&#39;t talk to me but she would smile and thats something. And her appearance started to change. I guess when she was dehydrated, both as a human and mermaid, her colors faded. But now her skin has tanned to that of a Caribbean princess, her hair has turned dark brown and has some blue and green highlights throughout its loose waves, her tail has turned from its sickly, pale blue to a vibrant aqua green with shimmering blue scales mixed in. I got her a bathing suit top to let her keep some modesty but her large F breasts are still very bouncy. Her lips are no longer chapped and dehydrated and now look extremely kissable. Thud! &quot;Ow!&quot;<br />
<br />
The mermaid stops splashing and turns to look at me. Looks like I was daydreaming too hard and my face slipped from my hand and hit the table. I touch my fingers to my chin and I see a little blood collected on the tip when I look back at it. &quot;That was embarrassing. I wish that never happened.&quot; Suddenly the blood disappears from my fingertips the mermaid is back to playing with a bird she found like nothing happened. I glance at my hand.  &quot;Oh course the ring!&quot; I totally forgot I had an all powerful ring that could do whatever I wanted. And right now, all I wanted was for this mermaid to like me. First I wish that I can make silent wishes from my mind. Then, I take off my shirt and  walk in the water. She swims away to the other side but then I wish for her to surface in front of me. Underwater, she does a flip and heads right to me. When she surfaces, her body is pressed right up against mine and I have to fight to avoid just staring at her large succulent chest. Oh wait, no I don&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do that?&quot; she says. And for the first time I really hear her voice. It&#39;s soft and fluid like a sea breeze and sends tingles down my spine. And to other places. I grab some composure and say &quot;Tell me your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Atla. Now how did you summom me, human?&quot;<br />
I pull my hand out of the water. &quot;You see this ring? With it, all of my wishes shall be granted. And just so you know, only I can use it so don&#39;t even bother trying to steal it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay then. Well what do you want with me?&quot;  Let&#39;s see. I have a drop dead gorgeous mermaid in front of me, an all powerful ring, and a bulge in my shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first, Atla. I want you to like me. Better yet, I want you to have a crush on me. If I so much as look at you, I want you to get excited.&quot; She gives me a weird look but then shakes her head and rubs as is she had a headache. And then she looks at me new eyes. I look into her and she starts blushing heavily.  She even holds her arms and of looks down into the water. Is she being coy? Well regardless, her arms pushing into her chest are only pushing her large breasts closer to me and it&#39;s doing a wonder on my board shorts. I can see straight down into her cleavage and I don&#39;t think she minds either. I readjust my bottoms so I&#39;m more comfortable in the tepid pool water. &quot;Use your magic&quot; I remind myself. So I silently wish that my package would not affected by the water&#39;s temperature. I look back up at Atla who is staring down into the water at my shorts.<br />
&quot;There is something swimming in your clothes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know. Would you like to see it?&quot;<br />
She nods her head slowly. I silently wish that my dick would grow to a more impressive size. 12 inches ought to do it. I untie my shorts and let them float away. My dick and balls dangle in the water, and in the sight of such a beautiful girl, start to harden up.<br />
&quot;Is it okay?&quot; she asks blushing.<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m fine, babe. Never better.&quot; And with my new confidence, I grab the mermaids head and pulls her in for a kiss. At first she&#39;s confused, but then I wish that she would be up to speed on the types of human relations. I break and start to kiss and suck on neck. She starts to moan and her chest heaves as the gills on her sides start taking deep breaths. Her hand goes to my dick and the touch grabs me surprise. She looks into my eyes as she starts pumping my dick. My dick is standing at about fifteen inches now and has broken the surface of the pool&#39;s shallow end. Atla begins to pick up speed I&#39;m forced to hold onto the railing to support myself. &quot;This is amazing! Atla I&#39;m close!&quot; I say as I unload my seed into the water surrounding us. &quot;That tastes so good. What was that?&quot; Still breathless from my amazing orgasm, I answer &quot;That was me. Well apart of me.&quot; She leans on the stairs next to me and starts to caress my arms. &quot;Can we do that again?&quot; I make another silent wish that I would ready go at moments notice. I also noticed that she is much stronger than me in the water so I better balance us out by wishing for myself to grow stronger. &quot;Alright Atla. Give me a minute.&quot; She floats backwards and watches.<br />
<br />
The heat first starts in my stomach. With each passing second, my core sends out a pulse that shoots across my body. Each pulse rips my muscles and heals them instantly so my body feels like it getting crunched. But after each pulse I can see my muscles balloon outward. My arms thicken, my chest pushes out forward, and stomach hardens. It all feels... great! The waves send endorphins too so I am just feeling waves and waves of pleasure. I can&#39;t help but to touch myself, to feel all the new growth. And by the looks of it, neither can Atla. She&#39;s fondling one of her boobs under her top, which only tied around her neck now. With her other hand, I see her reaching for her tail. I wish for perfect vision underwater and go see. She&#39;s twisting around alot but I can still make out a small hole on the half of her tail. &#39;She&#39;s trying to masturbate to me&#39; I think to myself. If a mermaid masturbating at the sight of you isn&#39;t the hottest thing on the planet then I don&#39;t know what is. And I need her now.<br />
<br />
I stop my muscle growth and wish to be able to breathe underwater without gills.  I walk over to my mermaid princess and pick her up. I carry her bridal style to the deep end of the pool kissing her all the way. We reach the bottom of the deepest part of the pool, the 7ft, and my head is only a few inches short of the surface. I guess my wish made me taller too. Atla likes the changes too as she wriggles herself out of my arms to swim around me, kissing and touching different parts of my body. I catch her again bring her down on the floor of the pool. I find her merpussy and position my tingling dick over it. I plunge myself into her as I go down for another kiss. Atla gasps as she is filled all the way to the hilt. I try to speak but she pulls into another kiss. So I start to pump myself in and out of her. I undo her top and push it towards my discarded shorts, leaving her massive breasts to bounce freely. I place one hand on a breast and play with the nipple as I kiss and grind into her. It must be working because her merpussy is clenching up around my dick, making me work harder to try to hold myself back. We roll around the pool floor for a while: kissing and fucking, fucking and kissing. After a while, the strain my balls becomes unbearable and I have to let go dumping my seed into her. Atla orgasms at the same time, giving my dick one final squeeze before we both go flaccid underwater. After we stop breathing heavy and shake the stars from our eyes, I pull out of Atla and position myself behind her to cuddle. &quot;Hey Atla?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;I wish we were in love&quot; and with that, she giggles, turns up to me, and kisses me on my cheek as we watch the sunset at the end of a very eventful day.</p>
