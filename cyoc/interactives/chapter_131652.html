<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tomas wouldn’t stop panicking. He cried out once again for help.<br />
<br />
“Cruuu! Cruuuu~!”<br />
<br />
Alas, that was the only sound his freshly-grown beak could make. The youngster was currently a pitiful abomination. Half-human, half-pigeon. A cheap counterfeit constructed in the futile hope of looking like any of those two of God’s creations, but turning out like a bastardization that was neither.<br />
<br />
Tomas danced around the room that acted as both a living room and kitchen in a panic. Not the sensual and slow dance that his beautiful and hairless body had performed mere minutes ago near the balcony, no. His current dance moves were limited to the flapping of the small and stubby wings that had replaced the entirety of his arms. Unless he were to be mocking another person by the means of imitating a chicken he wasn’t going to win any medals.<br />
<br />
His pathetic dance was interrupted when he heard steps from a multitude of people coming to his apartment door. Tomas’ mind excreted a multitude of curse words.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I heard the pigayon in this apartment. No, no idea how it got inside. I asked the landlord for the keys in advance. Thank you for your hard work...” Said the neighbor.<br />
<br />
Tomas’ exposed skin shivered. The abomination thought that the steps belonged to policemen. In reality, they just belonged to pest control. Tomas wasn’t sure of what a pigayon was exactly at this point in time, but something in his panicking heart told him that he was one of them now. And worse of all, it also told him that they were after him.<br />
<br />
He had lost his humanity but it’s in cases like these when possessing animal instincts has its own set of advantages. For example, if Tomas hadn’t felt the extreme need to run away just at this moment the front door would have been unlocked and five burly men in protective suits would have clubbed Tomas’ feeble body half-to-death before locking him up in a cage and send him to the local pigayon processing center. But he did felt the extreme need to run away and fearing the worst outcome the young pigeon man ran away immediately to the farthest place he could, which was the balcony.<br />
<br />
The balcony. The cold air on his bare skin. The lights shining on his private parts. All the eyes that could see him exposed like that in this instant.<br />
<br />
It was certainly ironic. All this time Tomas had been hesitant about going out into the balcony just like this. But now the circumstances were completely different. He couldn’t even cover his crotch in his state but the balcony was now the only place he could use to escape.<br />
<br />
But escape to where? Tomas lived near the top of the building. The only place he could go is down and if he were to do that the street cleaners would have to clean up a shitload of pigayon guts the following morning.<br />
<br />
The front door’s knob began to twist and the survival instinct pierced at Tomas’ heart once more. His feeble wings twitched, longing to fly out to somewhere safer.<br />
<br />
No, but it was impossible, right? His wings were too small. They were scrawny. Useless. A mockery from the powers that be.<br />
<br />
Hesitating, Tomas flapped his wings nervously. It was a laughable attempt, but he tried flapping them again and again. Nothing.<br />
<br />
It was clear to him that he needed to run up for some impulse. When the door opened, his instincts got the better of him and he jumped down the balcony.<br />
<br />
“Shit, the bugger escaped.” Said the pest control officer, stashing his club with disappointment.<br />
<br />
Tomas cruu’ed in utmost fear. He was falling to his death! Deep inside him, he always knew he was going to die naked.<br />
<br />
He flapped his wings very quickly in a ridiculous attempt at trying to get the hang of this flying thing.<br />
<br />
A family cooking up chicken for dinner saw a pink something fall out at a very high speed from outside their window for half a second. They shrugged and kept stuffing the chicken’s hole.<br />
<br />
Miraculously, it seemed like Tomas managed to fly seconds before impacting against the ground.<br />
<br />
It felt wonderful for a few moments. Of course, his flight wasn’t elegant like some sort of heroic superhero. He flapped his wings very quickly and advanced very slowly, falling down for a bit now and then. He was like toddler swimming with a floater: he manages, but you wouldn’t call him a professional.<br />
<br />
Tomas didn’t know where to head for. The ground didn’t look safe as he could get arrested and not just because his eight-inch long dick was exposed and wiggling all over the air for anyone to see but because the mere existence of his species seemed to be despised all over the metropolis.<br />
<br />
His wings were starting to tire out quickly. Tomas saw a good place to rest: the cross at the top of a huge old church. It definitely seemed safer than landing on top of any other nearby building, with all of them being skyscrapers full of people.<br />
<br />
Tomas perched himself on the cross and caught his breath. His entire body was sweating from all that flapping around and the cold nighttime air was making him shiver.<br />
<br />
How could this happen to him? What made him suddenly change? Is there any hope for him in this dangerous world that hates him? Those were all questions he wasn’t certain he could ever answer.<br />
<br />
His eyes began to dampen. He wanted to cry. He cruu’ed sadly. Some people on the ground that noticed him were pointing at the pigayon, as if he were a funny attraction.<br />
<br />
“Cruu!”<br />
<br />
Uh? That wasn’t Tomas...<br />
<br />
Tomas looked around and didn’t saw anything. Immediately afterwards another pigayon descended and perched just beside Tomas.<br />
<br />
Tomas looked at the other pigayon in shock. The unknown pigayon’s skin was darker than Tomas’, probably because it had spent a lot more time with its bare skin exposed outdoors than the former man.<br />
<br />
Its chest was very muscular and hairy, which contrasted a lot with Tomas’ hairless and delicate frame. Even its wings, while being just as small as Tomas’, gave the impression the pigayon worked out quite a lot.<br />
<br />
Its penis was huge as well. About nine inches, with a very generous girth unlike Tomas’ pencil prick. Huge hairy balls too.<br />
<br />
And its buttocks were enormously big. Hairy and strong-looking.<br />
<br />
The pigayon’s bearded face looked at Tomas’ body, scanning him with its pierceful eyes. Why was it looking at him like that...?<br />
<br />
Then it dawned on Tomas. It was doing just what Tomas had done just now: checking him out.<br />
<br />
The pigeon was looking at Tomas’ pale skin.<br />
<br />
At his slim and hairless chest.<br />
<br />
At his penis.<br />
<br />
At his buttocks.<br />
<br />
Finally, at Tomas’ eyes.<br />
<br />
“Cru, cru.”<br />
<br />
The eyes of the pigayon were animalistic. A bit devoid of emotion. So it was a bit hard for Tomas to understand at first.<br />
<br />
The muscular pigayon looked at Tomas’ butt. Then at its own hardening penis. Then it looked at Tomas straight in the eyes and cruu’ed as it swayed his rapidly hardening cock and balls in a very primitive mating dance.<br />
<br />
Oh shit, looks like it likes what he sees!<br />
<br />
But that was so wrong. They were two complete strangers, perched on top of a damn church, with lots of spectators looking at them, it would be so wrong for these lovebirds to just do it here and now!<br />
<br />
Tomas got flustered and shook his head. Then he got ready for take off, but...<br />
<br />
“Cruu!”<br />
<br />
Tomas’ eyes widened. The fucking pigayon’s beak...!<br />
<br />
It bit him...!<br />
<br />
...Right on his pencil prick!<br />
<br />
Tomas looked down at the pigayon that had captured his “worm” with extreme fear.<br />
<br />
The pigayon looked up at him, not loosening its grip on Tomas’ penis at all as he cruu’ed. Despite the lack of words Tomas knew very well what the pigayon, clearly an alpha, meant to say...<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t asking for a fuck. I DEMANDED a fuck, you slutty bird...”</p>
