<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back tracking to near the start of school; a 1962 Shelby Cobra whips into the school parking lot. Its engine revving and blaring; announcing to everyone in attendance to turn their heads to see the spectacle of the small blue convertible drift towards the student drop off spot and coming to a complete stop. Causing several students and teachers alike to jump back in fear that the car was about to roll over them. The driver with a devilish grin on her face as she enjoyed the adrenaline rush; he passenger had a look of abject terror as he gripped his seat.<br />
<br />
His face ashen and white after the stunt just pulled; Nate was understandably scared at his fiancée Jean.<br />
“What possessed you to do that,” Nate gasping between breaths.<br />
“I wanted to make a statement,” Jean turning to her mate.<br />
“And that would be,” Nate looking confused; “get out of my way or I’ll run you over?”<br />
“I was going to do this yesterday,” Jean answering; “but with you unable to come to school from the beating you took on Monday…”<br />
<br />
“Speaking of that,” Nate hearing the bell going off; “I’m going to be late.” Kissing Jean before getting out of the car; using the cane to give him leverage to get out of the car.<br />
“I’ll let you know if I’m getting a ride after school or not,” Nate turning around; “just don’t freak me out and everyone else with another stunt like that okay?”<br />
“Spoil sport,” Jean displaying a mock scowl; “just wait until Liv comes by, she’ll show you what fun can be. Even if you can’t be in your fursona to enjoy it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh god,” Nate groaning as Jean drives off; knowing she had to head to the college as she was studying to become a lawyer. Nate shakes his head as he turns around to head into the school. The second bell going off; Nate knew he was going to be late but he wasn’t concerned. Thanks to the two were-panthers attacking him Monday evening, Nate knew he had a readymade excuse. It was the cane he was gripping with his left hand as he used it to steady himself as he walked to the administration office; needing it as he was recovering from a damaged inner ear from Monday’s attack.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
After getting his schedule and locker information from the office, Nate made his way to his first class.<br />
“History from looks of things,” Nate calmly looking at his schedule; familiar with the schools layout, Nate knew where his class was. Seeing the door closed and the class already in session, Nate knocked on the door and waited.<br />
<br />
“Your late,” the teacher recognizing Nate as the door opened; seeing the teenager having to use a cane to walk around, the teacher sighed as Nate gave him the note Principal Andrews had for him.<br />
“Go take a seat,” the teacher reading the note and handing it back to Nate before continuing his lecture; “now where we?”<br />
<br />
Nate ignoring what the teacher was talking about took a quick look about the classroom; looking for a seat, Nate sees a few familiar faces. Smiling as Ben and Alex make eye contact with him; Nate’s does a double take as he sees next to them is his younger brother Eric sitting next to them. Wondering what the hell was going on, Nate knew the half dozen or so questions he wanted to ask would have to wait. Seeing the only empty seat was next a brunette girl, Nate quickly took it; thanks to his were-sense of smell, Nate could quickly tell that she was a were-lioness.<br />
‘I wonder if she is part of the Talbot clan,’ Nate thought to himself.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
After first period ended, Nate was out of the classroom; accompanied by Ben, Alex and Eric. Nate finding out that their classes are almost identical; the only difference was Nate’s math class was with another teacher. Ben, Alex and Eric had Jeff Wilson for their math teacher.<br />
“Oh joy fat piggy,” Nate shaking his head; “yet explain to me why Eric was in history class with us.”<br />
“It’s because I have been placed in advanced classes,” Eric speaking up. “On top of that, the free periods senior have; I have college courses to take.”<br />
“And how the hell did you get that,” Nate twisting his face in confusion.<br />
“My grades,” Eric answering; “perfect scores on every test.”<br />
“And why have I only been told about this now,” Nate pausing in the hallway; needing the moment as a slight wave of dizziness took him.<br />
“Well you should dad,” Eric shaking his head; “as to why he never told me about this all through summer break. He and mom knew and chose to let Principal Andrews tell me about this.”<br />
<br />
Nate was taken aback by that bit of news; causing him to walk to class in silence with his brother and friends.<br />
“Science,” Nate looking at his schedule; “thanks to me the rest of you are late.”<br />
“The teacher isn’t hear yet,” Ben smiling as he enters the class room; “were in the clear.”<br />
“Not so,” Alex looking at the back of the class room; “the idiot were-elephants are here.”<br />
“Eric,” Nate sighing before getting interrupted.<br />
“I already had an encounter with the tusk brigade,” Eric cutting Nate off; “I made it clear to them, I’m not someone they can bully that won’t fight back.”<br />
“And he did it all alone from what we heard,” Alex chuckling; “while in the library.”<br />
“Letting them know I killed a man,” Eric looking serious; “did give them pause.”<br />
<br />
As Nate sits down with the group; Rex Harry and Larry, sitting in the back of the classroom stare at the Anderson’s.<br />
“Looks like Nate is a cripple,” Harry toying with a toothpick; “perhaps we can go after him after school.”<br />
“He is with a werewolf pack,” Rex slapping Harry in the back of the head; “with two of his pack mates here, that would be suicide.”<br />
“Not if we get him alone,” Larry speaking quietly; “and from the looks of it, someone already did that.”<br />
“Do you both have rocks for brains,” Rex looking at both with a expression of disappointment; “Nate is untouchable. Dating the were-lion king’s daughter, running with a pack; that is two groups’ you don’t screw with. Now the real prize,” Rex looking at Eric Anderson and speaking quietly; “is our were-panther that dared to stand up to us.”<br />
“You want to fight him,” Harry looking at their leader oddly; “I checked around, what Eric said yesterday in killing a person. It was true; happened Saturday evening up at the Knight Estate.”<br />
“We don’t go at him directly,” Rex looking thoughtful; “we go after those ladies he was with.”<br />
“I could care less if you need an ego boost,” Larry shaking his head; “to go after Frieda, is to court her father’s wrath.”<br />
“Yet the other girl,” Rex smiling; “I doubt she has anything to keep us from going after her. And if Eric tries to stop us,” Rex grins; “well that is two against three. The odds are still in our favor.”</p>
