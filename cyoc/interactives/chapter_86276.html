<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica stood up first, stretching luxuriously as she did, &quot;Well guys I&#39;m calling first shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded tiredly, dozing off from all he&#39;d done and Nikki was about to protest when she caught a glimpse of the Chronivac out of the corner of her eye. She had a lot of fun fucking Jessica&#39;s pussy, there were was no doubt about that and she was sure that she&#39;d do it again, but it could be better. After all, if she was going to have to share Chris with her, which she would, since Chris was Jessica&#39;s boyfriend, she might as well make the situation more agreeable all around, because was there anything better than having a hot pussy boy and his girlfriend to fuck? Yes, as far as Nikki was concerned there was and she knew exactly how to get it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jessica stepped into the shower, her thighs sticky with pussy juice and her perky c-cup breasts aching from the way Nikki had been squeezing them. She gave her nipples a little flick, smiling at how Nikki was really getting into her new life, thanks to the changes she had made to her with the Chronivac. Giving her a cock had been a good test, but making her bi, increasing her sex drive to that of a guy and making her more willing to experiment, all without her knowing anything about it, had really resulted in some good times. Her clit and pussy tingled at the thought of all the things she could do with her newly endowed roommate and Chris. And thinking of Chris, maybe they should give him his cock back, or maybe not. At least not right away. It was kind of hot seeing him with his big strong body and a neatly groomed little pussy. Besides, he had never eaten her out as well as he had earlier, as though having a pussy of his own made him more skilled. Yeah, that made sense. She gave her clit a little rub as she thought about it, enjoying the waves of pleasure radiating from the little nub before she turned on the water and began to wash herself.<br />
<br />
She started with shampooing her hair, which was thoroughly tangled from all the three of them had done. Working her fingers through the knots she frowned. It was getting a bit unmanageable now that it was shoulder length. Maybe it was time to get a haircut, something nice and short. That sounded like a good idea. Sh didn&#39;t know why she&#39;d let it get so long in the first place, letting it go so long that it almost reached her shoulders was a bit too much.<br />
<br />
Moving past her hair she soaped up her chest, taking her time with her breasts. They were a nice little b-cup, nothing too showy, which suited her just fine. Big breasts were hot and all, but she liked seeing them more than she liked the idea of having them. Like Nikki&#39;s formerly c, now d-cup breasts, they were hot, those were a pair of tits that she&#39;d have no problem sucking. It was kind of weird how Nikki was into the whole lactation thing, but she had been willing to go along with it since it made her friend happy. Later though she might talk to Nikki about it, see if she wanted to stop lactating, but keep those big, gorgeous breasts, mmm they were hot. She rubbed her own breasts at the thought before her attention drifted lower still. Her pussy was mostly clean shaven, just a little strip of hair down the center. When she washed down there, cleaning all the cum from her thighs she gave a bit of extra attention to her clit, smiling at the memory of Chris eating her out. Maybe later she&#39;d return the favor, or maybe not. She had made a few adjustments to his personality when she gave him his tight new pussy, like making him a bit submissive and of course making him less opposed to the idea of having a cock inside him, provided that cock belonged to a girl, after all the goal had been to make it so that Nikki could fuck him, not to make him gay and it had worked better than either of the girls had imagined.<br />
<br />
She finished washing herself, turned off the water and stood there for a moment, hands resting on her narrow hips, enjoying the warmth of the shower before getting off to towel off. First she dried off her hair, deciding that it was time to get it cut. It had gotten long enough that it was starting to tickle her ears and look a little girly, which didn&#39;t suit her at all. She kind of liked her sort of tomboy look, especially since her features were a bit on the boyish side, thin lips, angular cheek bones, thick eyebrows. It suited her and, she thought, smiling at her reflection, once she got a decent haircut she&#39;d look more than a bit like a boy, albeit a skinny one. She could pass for one if she tired though, she was sure of it. her shoulders were pretty wide for a girl and her a-cup breasts were hardly noticeable if she didn&#39;t dress to draw attention to them, or if she wore a sports bra, which was what she usually wore anyway, when she even bothered to wear a bra. They were uncomfortable anyway and unnecessary for her at least. Leaning in a little closer she admired her reflection in the mirror. She&#39;d been working out with Chris a bit lately and it was finally starting to show. She flexed her arms, pleased to see that she was starting to go past being toned and build some actual muscle, even better was that beneath her small breasts she could see the start of pecs. A closer look there and her smile widened further, between her breasts she could make out a scant few hairs. Thin and blond, they were hardly visible, but seeing them there pleased her. With her little, but still there breasts, going shirtless wasn&#39;t an option for her, but she liked that she had a bit of chest hair, even if it was something only she noticed.<br />
<br />
More noticeable was the thin trail of hair on her stomach, leading up from her pussy and stopping just below her navel. Chris teased her about it, especially when she had started working out with him, but he had eased up when he realized that she was serious about her appearance. The fact that she almost had a six-pack helped too, she was sure. He&#39;d been surprised that she kept up with the workout routine he came up with for her and she thought that he was even more surprised when she actually started making progress, and she was. She put her hands on her narrow, boyish hips and turned in a slow circle. Even her butt was looking better, losing some of its jiggle and getting toned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fall in or something?&quot; Chris complained, knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
Jessica rolled her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m almost done, don&#39;t get your panties in a wad.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed at Chris&#39; small noise of outrage. When she&#39;d given him a pussy she hadn&#39;t realized how fun it would be to tease him about it.<br />
<br />
Before she could say anything more Chris opened the door and walked right in, stopping to look at her and smirk, &quot;Looking at yourself in the mirror, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
She glared at him, not sure why she found the comment so annoying, &quot;So what if I was?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged, &quot;Don&#39;t get bent out of shape. You&#39;re looking pretty good.&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounded like he added the last part as a sort of apology, but she didn&#39;t care. It was still a compliment and she was looking pretty good, &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaving him to wash up she went to her room to get dressed. First she got a pair of plain, white cotton panties and put them on. Nikki made fun of her for that, she always had, saying that she hardly acted like a girl, but then again Nikki had a cock that she thought she&#39;d always had now and wore boxers so what did that matter anymore?<br />
<br />
That brought a smile to Jessica&#39;s face and she looked around for a pair of clean jeans. Her smile grew as she zipped up her pants and admired her six-pack abs. The time she&#39;d spent working out was finally starting to pay off. Then again, she&#39;d been working out for long enough that it was about time her persistence finally paid off. During her first semester of college she&#39;d first met Chris in the gym and they&#39;d hit it off pretty well. He&#39;d been surprised that a girl was so interested in working out and that gave something to talk about.<br />
<br />
As she reminisced she looked around for a t-shirt and settled on a plain green one. Green looked good on her, brought out her eyes or something. At least that was what Nikki said and Nikki was the one who was more concerned about fashion and all that stuff. Jessica pulled her shirt on and smiled. That shirt alone was enough to hide her breasts, which were hardly there at all, less than an a-cup according to Nikki. Hell, when she and Chris had first met at the gym it had taken him a week to realize that she was a girl. Of course that had been during her first semester of college where she&#39;d been trying really hard with her crew cut and not shaving for weeks at a time to try and get a bit of stubble going. After she met Chris and they hit it off she eased up with that sort of stuff a little. He wasn&#39;t enough to make her act all girly, but he had gotten her to relax, which was more than any other guy she&#39;d met had managed. Nikki had been girly enough for the two of them, which had also helped. It had been Nikki who first suggested that she ask Chris out, not realizing how hard that was for her. She liked Chris and all, but she hadn&#39;t been sure if that was what she wanted. Guys were fine, but she hadn&#39;t been sure if she wanted a relationship until she tired. She and Chris were friends and not much more than that. Thinking about it any other way was kind of awkward. That was why she&#39;d given Nikki a cock and brought her into the relationship with the help of the Chronivac. It also gave Chris what he wanted since he&#39;d been bugging her about a threesome with Nikki for months now, of course that had been before he had a pussy and Nikki had a cock, but in the end everything worked out great. Remembering the look on Chris&#39; face as he writhed with pleasure, impaled on Nikki&#39;s cock had been worth it. Giving Nikki a cock had been such a great idea if just for that.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Nikki tried to hide her surprise as Jessica came into the living room. The results were exactly what she had programed into the Chronivac, but they still came as a shock. If she hadn&#39;t known the person standing in the hall was Jessica she wouldn&#39;t have recognized them. She had short, scruffy hair, the kind of haircut a guy would have, she was wearing guy&#39;s clothing, her hips were narrow and her shoulders wide, there was no trace of breasts on her chest, to the contrary, the new Jessica was rather on the muscular side, though not as muscular as Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jessica, did you enjoy your shower?&quot; Nikki asked breathlessly, admiring what the Chronivac had done.<br />
<br />
Jessica rolled her eyes, &quot;Real cute Nikki, real cute. Just because I have a pussy doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m a girl. Do you want me to start calling you Nick because you&#39;ve got a dick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica smiled at her little rhyme and Nikki let out a nervous little laugh. Even her friend&#39;s voice sounded masculine, but that was what she had wanted, more than that, the new Jessica was hot. She hadn&#39;t expected the changes she had made to reality to be so through, but then again the same thing had happened to Chris when she and Jessica gave him a pussy so she should have expected it, &quot;Sorry Jessie,&quot; she tried, hoping that her guess about was right.<br />
<br />
If she&#39;d been thinking she would have double checked her friend&#39;s name once she finished putting everything into the Chronivac, but she had been so excited that it slipped her mind. She had specified that Jessica was going to end up a boy with a pussy so she should have expected a name change along with everything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m just teasing you. We&#39;ve been friends for so long I thought you could take it,&quot; he laughed, &quot;I just like giving you a hard time, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nikki said softly, getting up the courage to ask the question she had, &quot;What do you think of us doing this sort of thing more often? I mean the three of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Because of what she had put into the Chronivac Jessie was supposed to be okay with the idea, but she still had a hard time believing the power of the device, even with proof right before her eyes.<br />
<br />
Jessie smiled, &quot;Of course! I think it&#39;s pretty hot myself and I know Chris&#39;ll be thrilled. Hell, I&#39;m glad you went along with us. I was getting sick of hearing Chris talking about me hooking the two of you up and you have no idea how much I&#39;ve wanted to ride a real cock rather than some &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; Nikki beamed, glad that everything worked out just as she had hoped. Now she had not one, but two hot pussy boys willing to ride her cock.</p>
