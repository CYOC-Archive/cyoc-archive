<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Norton sat in his bedroom, trying desperately to remember anything from his childhood.  Letting his eyes drift over the room, he saw something from his childhood a stuffed animal he hadn't seen in years.<br />
<br />
It was a stuffed fox, Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog to be more specific, only Norton had put doll clothes on it and made it look more female. &quot;Why did I do that,&quot; he thinks to himself as he picks up the stuffed animal and lays down upon the bed, sticking his thumb in his mouth and slowly drifting off to sleep.<br />
<br />
It is in dreams that Norton remembers that until the day he started school, his mother allowed him to dress and act like a girl because he felt it was what he was supposed to be. His father had no say in this because he disappeared sometime around the time Norton was born and for awhile his mother went along with it, thinking it was nothing more then a phase her son was going through.<br />
<br />
Later, about when he was five, Norton's mother put her foot down, told him it was time he started acting like the boy he was and that in truth their religion never really approved of his actions, claiming it was the work of the devil that Norton acted the way he did.<br />
<br />
And so Norton was given a hair cut, bought boy's clothes, had all his dolls taken away and sent to school as a boy. And for years he completely forgot that period in his life.<br />
<br />
Later, when he was about eighteen or nineteen, he pierced his ears, hoping to force his mother into talking to him about a childhood he could no longer remember and she refused to speak of. It didn't work and Norton left for college, never speaking to his mother again and refusing to even acknowledge her religion.<br />
<br />
Norton awoke, the stuff fox pressed tightly next to him and at first he can't remember anything, but after a moment it all comes back to him; the arcade, the strange transformation afterward and now the fact that he can remember in great detail his childhood.<br />
<br />
A movement and Norton is aware that someone else is in the room with him. Looking about the darkened room, he hears a low feminine voice whisper out, &quot;You show promise. You might be what I seek. Yet I sense that you only have half of what I seek. And, you have not finished your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Norton squeaks out in his little voice, &quot;What do you want? And who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice answers back, &quot;You may call me May and as for what I want, well it's more of what I need. Or maybe what you want and need. Tell me, is the life of a girl something you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Norton can only lay there, clutching he stuffed fox in doll clothes to himself. May replies, &quot;The life of a girl,&quot; and then says something unpronounceable and Norton suddenly feels suddenly really weird. Around him the world shifts and as he realizes that he's been forced into a sitting position, Norton is overcome with a bout of cramps and looking down, he realizes that he's looking at a girl's body.<br />
<br />
As Norton realizes this, he suddenly realizes that why he feels so strange is because he's experiencing the menstrual cycle woman must go through about every month.<br />
<br />
Everything goes dark and May can be heard whispering into his ear. &quot;The life of a girl,&quot; and suddenly Norton feels something pushing into his vagina and as Norton achieves an orgasm, he suddenly realizes that this is how a woman has sex, as he moves his body gently, gyrating his hips and pelvis with the time on his partner, who's lying atop him, allowing the man to cup and massage his breast.<br />
<br />
May whispers again and the world shifts for a third time and suddenly Norton feels really weird again and looking down, Norton can see several large lumps. The first two he sees are his breasts, now engorged and swelling with milk. Below that is his abdomen, swollen with the miracle of life. As Norton gazes at this, he suddenly is aware of how swollen and sore are his feet and the dull throbbing of his lower back. But all this was pushed aside as suddenly Norton was overcome by a feeling he could only describe as being proud to be an expecting mother.<br />
<br />
May asked her question again and this time Norton replied, &quot;This is but a small account of what being a female is. I'd gladly take all of this and more in trade for my masculenity.&quot;<br />
<br />
May chuckled at this and suddenly she was gone. The area around Norton grew dark, but this only lasted a moment as Norton became aware of a red light and just as Norton is thinking, &quot;I'm reverted back to the time I was in the womb,&quot; a feeling came over him and without thinking about it, Norton began to kick and head-butt the sides until a ray of light poked through.<br />
<br />
Realizing that what he's actually in is an egg is all drowned out as he hears a human female voice squeal out with delight, &quot;It's a girl! Congratulations Ms. Floyd! It's a healthy baby girl, and look. She has a blue dragon tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
A woman comments that she'll call the girl Lottie and suddenly Norton's old life is gone. Replaced by the fact the she can not see properly, has no control over her arms and legs, or over tail, which gently twitches back and forth as she is cleaned and then wrapped in something warm.<br />
<br />
As the last residual traces of Norton fade, baby Lottie thinks, &quot;I could live like this. A blue dragon, human hybrid. Yeah. It could be worse,&quot; and then gives herself over completely to her new life.<br />
<br />
Above her, the woman's voice is gently crooning a lullaby, only to break off with promises of what Lottie's life is to hold; including attending Mrs. Murial's School for Girls when she reaches the age of eleven or twelve. But all this escapes little Lottie as she snuggles closer to her mother.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Hidden, May watches as the little girl with the dragon tail is born, still sensing that this human hybrid dragon is still only half of the solution she requires.<br />
<br />
Sighing, she decides that she'll just have to wait and see how everything turns out. Muttering something, she leaves a magick tracer on the girl that only she can, May, can see and recognize. Satisfied, she mutters something else and disappears in search of the other person that possibly carries the clue on how to best strike at the ones controlling the arcade.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as Norton is being transformed into baby Lottie, a timid man of about twenty three enters the arcade, wondering what all the excitement is about this new place of business. Along with him is his girlfriend, who is just as timid as he is.</p>
