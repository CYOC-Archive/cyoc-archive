<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">July wanted to take a relaxing day as the day had been very hectic. Here sister Lucy was pregnant with their ex-brother Jack, ex-mother Amy and surprise guest Gabriel. Ofcourse Lucy, age 44, was blissfully ignore any of this and thought that she was 4-months pregnant to triplets. The effect of the Aeris&#39;s Age Ring was capable to swap or steal realities at this point. July had become a demi-god of some sort with the ring and could affect the world with flick of her finger. Sadly in order to gain more powers and perks she had to absorb more years to the ring in order for Aeris to make themselves more powerful.<br />
<br />
As July and Lucy sat on the table finishing their meals. July was getting bored.<br />
<br />
All excitement of the cat and mouse chase had left her wanting something more. She didn&#39;t have money and randomly stealing people inside her ring was not that interesting. She thought about a plan that tomorrow after a good night sleep she would do hatch a plan how she could stealthly snag people without anybody noticing.<br />
<br />
The evening went a quietly in the Anders household. Lucy only having minor hiccups because of the belly.<br />
<br />
In the morning Lucy had assumed her role as a caretaker of the family while July was ... well still July. As she wore the ring even in her sleep her perception wasn&#39;t changing. And as Lucy knocked her door as asked what her sister would like for breakfast July just grunted and asked for french toast.<br />
<br />
She was getting tired of the 44-year-old body she had. Her breasts needed bra all the time, the crow&#39;s feet needed make-up and she hadn&#39;t got used to doing it daily so she out a sigh and decided to make herself more younger. Maybe twenty two or even eighteen. She clenched her fist and thought about number twenty four and shrunk into a 20-year-old body. The clothing was now reflecting her new age as the ring had enough juice to affect a lot of things than just age.<br />
<br />
But with small fine tuning she could think about adding or losing couple of ages here and there until she settled to a 22-year-old body which was in her eyes perfect. Not too young or not too old. As she begun to apply her morning make-up she had vision of her mother and gabriel doing them for her. As if their experiences were guiding how she could do it. So she did just that. Took inspiration from both of them and went with a slight of heavy mascara, but not full emo or goth style.<br />
<br />
&#39;I think the ring basically has gifted me the years they have lost. I don&#39;t think like them, but I somehow tap into their lives as if I was them. Weird...&#39; July thought as she ironed her hair. &#39;Maybe that&#39;s my plan for today. Find a person who is good at something and steal that, but what would that be exactly. I don&#39;t know.&#39;<br />
<br />
She took her bag from top of the bed and noticed that she had a drivers license and a campus card. She was a student at an Ivy school which was near the town and her phone was filled with messages from group chat invites. July thought this a little bit and saw a fragment of memory where Amy and Gabriel had gone to a college so this must have also made it so that when she was now in her twenties their lives now affected July&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
&#39;Very bizarre, but maybe I shouldn&#39;t think this that hard,&#39; July shook her head.<br />
<br />
As July descented the stairs Lucy was still giving her greeting as if she was her sister, but treated her living in the house as if she was only there temporarily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you can take care of me while you are at college.&quot; Lucy said as she prepared the french toast breakfast for both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, ha ha, did you need anything from the store since I need to borrow the car for today.&quot; July asked.<br />
<br />
It was if she was in auto-pilot in this new reality. Watching a movie where July knew how to respond as if she was living her life as college student. After the breakfast and warm hug, she got herself into a car and noticed that she was able to control her movement again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me, but the ring might need more people sucked inside it so I don&#39;t act like a zombie in this new life.&quot; July said to herself and started to drive towards the campus.</p>
