<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Di woke up early on Monday.  She stepped out of bed, still wearing her nightie and panties.  She headed for the bathroom, grabbing a towel from a cabinet as she went.  She took off her nightwear and got into the shower.  She admired her female body.  It was hard to believe that yesterday morning she had woken up as a boy.  This was so much better.  She absolutely loved being a woman.  <br />
<br />
She rubbed her hands all over her body as she applied her feminine floral body wash.  When she reached her pussy, she began to finger herself, enjoying herself.  Before long, Di had an orgasm; she tried to hold back from crying out, but gasps slipped through here and there.  She hoped she didn&#39;t wake anyone else up, but then again it wouldn&#39;t have been the first time.  <br />
<br />
Wait... it wouldn&#39;t?  Di realized that she was remembering from her female past, which had been fabricated by her transformation.  Di liked having these memories to draw on, but didn&#39;t want to forget the actual past either.  &quot;I wish that I will not forget my past as Ty, no matter what form I take,&quot; Di whispered to herself.  She wanted to always remember the miracle that had occurred.  She wanted to always remember that her power was special and had changed her for the better.<br />
<br />
Di finished up in the shower, dried off, and headed back to her room.  She considered changing her female form, but decided against it.  She wanted to experience the life of her current body for a while.  She went into her closet and selected some hip-hugging jeans and a trendy, long, belted, off-white tunic with a sweetheart line.  She also selected knee high, black, ruffle boots with a sharp, 3-inch heel.  She brought these items out of her closet and set them on the bed.  She then went over to her dresser and picked a comfortable lavender bra and a matching lavender thong, as well as cute <br />
<br />
She put her underwear on and realized how well her wish had performed.  She had instinctively known what clothing to choose for her body.  Many women do not prefer thongs, because they ride up so easily, but Di realized that she didn&#39;t mind it riding up, and enjoyed the sexiness of it.  Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be the case with every female form.<br />
<br />
Di sat at her vanity and started doing her hair and make-up.  This took quite a bit longer than the former Ty would have expected, but Di knew that it would; that&#39;s why she had gotten up early.  When she was finished, Di&#39;s face presented itself gorgeously, with long locks of wavy hair and simply-done, tasteful make-up that accentuated her already angelic features.  Finally, she walked over to her bed and dressed herself in the clothes she had selected.<br />
<br />
Di opened her door and proceeded out into the upstairs hall, loving the way her female form moved.  June had just come up the stairs.  June was dressed in a tasteful black dress with nylons and 5-inch stilettos.  June dressed a bit more sexily since the mental change Di had given her, but still with a level of elegant taste.  Sexy clothing was essential for a successful sex shop owner.  June noticed Di.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hello Di.  I just forgot my purse up here yesterday,&quot; said June.  June paused and gazed at Di for a moment before saying &quot;You&#39;re looking gorgeous, as always, my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di blushed and said &quot;Thanks, June.&quot;  As June headed into the study to get her purse, Di started to head downstairs and paused when June continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark is being an ass, as usual,&quot; said June.  &quot;I think it&#39;s having a bad effect on Dustin, he&#39;s been seeming distant lately.  Would you talk to him for me?&quot; she inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;To Mark or to Dustin?&quot; asked Di.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin,&quot; June answered.  &quot;Don&#39;t bother talking to Mark; it&#39;s like talking to a wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Di.  &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to work things out with Mark.  Just try and stay positive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Di.  I appreciate that,&quot; June said as she headed into the study.<br />
<br />
Di walked downstairs and out the front door, making sure she had her keys and purse.  Her backpack had been left in her car.  She walked to the curb and got into the car.  It was her own car that she had paid for using money she had earned from tutoring.  She was great in math and was able to make some cash on the side by tutoring other students.  The car was a light blue beetle that she thought was so cute.  She started the car and drove off, and made another wish.  &quot;I cannot be physically damaged; my body is invulnerable to harm.&quot;  She didn&#39;t want her new life as a woman to end just after it began in some terrible accident.  She had to make sure that she could continue living her dream life.</p>
