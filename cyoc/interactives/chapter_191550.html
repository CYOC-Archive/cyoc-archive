<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking through his options, Jeff stumbles apon a section labled &quot;vehicles&quot;, he opens the file and spots a folder labled &quot;cars&quot;. Jeff enjoys cars, ever since he was a kid, he visited thousands of car shows with his dad, who is just as crazy into cars like his son. &quot;Becoming a toy car for the weekend would be amazing,&quot; the teen mumbles to himself, &quot;and maybe, after the weekend, I&#39;ll become a real car&quot;. Jeff opens the folder and scans through all the different types of cars, until his eyes land on &quot;Chevrolet&quot;, this somehow reminds him of &quot;Bumblebee&quot; from the movie series &quot;Transformers&quot;. The teen smiles at the imagination of becoming a yellow Chev with black racing stripes, just like Bumblebee, he might not become a actual &quot;Transformer action figure&quot;, but he&#39;d at least have the feeling being &quot;Bumblebee&quot; in his car-form.<br />
<br />
Jeff opens the folder and starts to type, designing the car he wants to become:<br />
<br />
First Jeff chooses the model of the car, which is a Chevrolet Camaro, in the original movies the Camaro-Bumblebee has only two doors, but Jeff decides that four doors would be much cooler. He then sets the main color to be yellow and adds black racing stripes, he also sets it so he is able to still see and hear, but he set it so he is unable to talk, as he scrolls down he finds a category that allows him to chose: either being a remote controled car or non-remote controled car. Imagining being driven around, even though he knew that no one was home over the weekend to &quot;use&quot; him, Jeff decides to be a remote controled car, so he sets the size of the car to a standard remote-controled car. The boy then sets the duration of the transformation to last 48 hours, and the time of the transformation to 10 minute, so that he could enjoy watching himself slowly transforming into this cool car. Lastly the program asks if he&#39;d like to be a 2-door or a 4-door Camaro, &quot;Hmm... the original Bumblebee, I think, is a two-door Camaro,&quot; Jeff mumbles to himself, &quot;four doors would be cooler though, at least I&#39;ll have the original coloring of Bumblebee&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once everything is put in, Jeff checks one last time, satisfied with the settings he had done, he hits confirm. Jeff starts to strip out of his clothes until he is standing completely nude in front of his mirror. He is so excited that he forgets that his window is wide open, but since his room is on the second floor of his families home, he should be safe from prying eyes. One thing not on Jeff&#39;s mind is, that if a robber or some punk teen notices the open window and no car in the driveway or garage, this person might just take the chance and climb in through the open window.<br />
<br />
The second Jeff had stripped, he feels a tingling all over his body, he looks in the mirror and watches in shock and amazement his body canging. First, all of his body hairs, even the ones on his head, fall out, leaving him bald, Jeff can&#39;t help but to laugh, &quot;man, I look so silly,&quot; he says. He then suddenly feels a rush, as if someone or something is pulling him downwoards as he starts to shrink, only stopping when he reaches the hight of a remote controled racing car, which is 21 inches. Luckily, his mirror reaches to the floor, &quot;man, I feel so tiny,&quot; Jeff says to himself. The teen then watches as his body becomes yellow, his hands and feet turn black while black stripes appear on his face, the boy then gasps as he watches his feet and hands seem to inflate, the skin turning into rubber tires. Jeff then suddenly loses his balance as his legs start to do a split, his arms snap upwards, lining with his shoulders, he falls forward landing on his hands, now front tires. &quot;Ooof, at least I know my hydrolics work,&quot; Jeff says with a grin. He tries to relax his mouth, but finds that it is stuck in that same grin, the boy starts to panic, until he remembers that cars have grills. Soon enough he watches as his mouth becomes the grill of a car, he tries to talk but is unable to make a sound. Jeff watches as his nose becomes the car&#39;s emblem, his ears become the side mirrors, while his eyes fuse together, becoming the transparent windscreen, his eyes brows become the whipers. Jeff&#39;s body expands, he feels his butt-hole seal shut as a trunk takes form, rear lights appear on the former boy&#39;s butt. The teen notices front lights appear on his changing face, he feels his insides churn as they become the interior of a car, this is when he notices that he can&#39;t feel his dick anymore, he assumes that his dick has become the tiny gear-stick. Soon, a brand new yellow Cevrolet Camaro with black racing stripes is standing in front of the mirror, then there is a &quot;crack&quot; sound and a remote in matching coloring appears right next to it. Jeff&#39;s clothes, which are lying on the floor, suddenly start to move, creeping closer and closer to each other, until they are one big pile. The clothes then seem to melt into each other, the texture slowly seeming less cloth and more of a cardboard, soon a box for a remote controled racing car stands in the place of the clothes. The box then starts to move towards the remote control and the &quot;car&quot;. One side of the box opens and it seems to swallow/eat the remote, once inside the box, the remote gets binded by hard plastic strings. Jeff then feels something moving under his new body, he watches in the mirror as the box slowly seems to &quot;eat&quot; him. Once inside, the same plastic bindings wrap around the &quot;car&quot; tight, holding it in place as the sides close. A transparent plastic outer packaging appears around the box, sealing it within. Jeff does not notice as writing appears on the box, spelling: &quot;TRANSFORMERS &quot;BUMBLEBEE&quot; 4-DOOR-EDITION!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stares at his new form in mental amazment, &#39;woah... I look so cool,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;so, this is what it feels like to be a toy car, which is unpackaged and unused. I hope I wont get bored, 48 hours is a long time, for some odd reason I feel the urge to want to be used&#39;. The former boy is so amazed of what had happened to him, that he does not realize someone climbing in through the open window.</p>
