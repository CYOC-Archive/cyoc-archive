<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Saturday morning, Kendall sent a message to Connor. &quot;I solved your problem. You will change back in 4 days.&quot; She thought Connor should know. Connor complained about Allen being in the know, but being saved by his girlfriend should shut up all his complaints. Still, she should be careful and withhold some information from him. If she told him Josie was behind it, knowing Connor, he would immediately rush to confront her. This all required cunning and tact, and Connor was the type to use brutish force, not that he even could do that in his current state.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, a reply came from Connor. &quot;Really? Explain it all!&quot;<br />
<br />
She texted that she could come over and explain it in person. Matters like these were too delicate to explain in just text, and besides, now that she had some control over the situation, she was less worried and instead more curious about Connor&#39;s situation. It was all temporary after all, that is if Josie were to hold her promise to change him back.<br />
<br />
After a quick trip, Kendall rang the doorbell and waited. Connor opened the door. Kendall could see that he had changed even more since she last left him. It was a small girly thing standing there. A short stature, a small upturned nose, skinny arms poking out of her baggy sweater. Nothing was masculine about this girl. Kendall found it both hilarious and disgusting that her Connor could be reduced to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, did you actually figure this out?&quot; Connor asked. How high-pitched his voice was. One thing was thinking of this girl as Connor, but this voice. These squeaky sounds weren&#39;t Connor at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Kendall smirked. &quot;Yesterday I saved your little butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then explain it. Is someone behind this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone from school used some kind of device to do this to you. They wanted revenge, revenge on you, and us, but I convinced her to reconsider her actions. She said she could change you back in about four days, or three days from today, since she said it yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Three more days then.&quot; Connor paused, probably taking it all in. He seemed surprisingly calm.<br />
<br />
She had expected Connor to immediately get riled and try to hunt down the person behind this, but he didn&#39;t see, angry at all. Was it because of his change? He must have less testosterone in his body, so that was one explanation. Still, it was somewhat unnerving to see Connor so calm and collected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, the person behind this. I&#39;ll tell you who it is, but you have to promise me to treat her nicely, or else she might not change you back, or change you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise. Who is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Josie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; He stopped a bit before he continued. &quot;Josie did this, so does mean that she did it when Jenna confronted me? That happened Monday I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably. I don&#39;t know. Just don&#39;t do anything more to mess up Josie&#39;s opinion of you. Whatever, I am leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m meeting up with the girls today, before the game tonight.&quot; she lied.<br />
<br />
Really, she had to leave. She couldn&#39;t hold her mask for much longer. The note she was clutching in her hand, &quot;If you want another hot hookup...&quot;. What the hell was this? Who had made this note? Had Connor actually had sex, sex like this?  Was it with a girl, or what if it was a boy? She had to confront him about this, but not now. This was better settled after he was properly restored to his male self. Then Kendall could figure out if Josie had messed with his mind, or if Connor was just being his horny self, sex-hungry enough to hookup even if he was a girl. The outcome that her boyfriend had been unfaithful was one thing, but it was even more worrying if Josie had the ability to alter minds, but what is the mind, but a plaything of the body. She didn&#39;t want to be under Josie&#39;s whims. Convincing her to show Connor mercy was one thing, but could she trust Josie, or even anyone other than herself with this power?<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Connor was left home alone. He was still pondering the implications of what he had just heard. If this was a couple of days ago, he would have been absolutely furious at Josie for doing this to him, but ever since yesterday with Allen, he had been in a daze. Just the thought of Allen caused his heart to skip a beat, as memories of their escapade flashed in his head. All that pleasure he&#39;d been given, and Allen&#39;s buff body, whic hwas  branded into his memory. Did Connor really want to give this up, when he&#39;d just touched the surface and was already taken.<br />
<br />
If Connor went back to his male self, could he then continue with Allen? He was pretty sure Allen was into girls. Connor looked at his body. It had changed a little more since yesterday. He was still becoming shorter, weaker and more feminine. Would Allen like that? He didn&#39;t know, but it excited Connor. With every inch he shrunk, Allen towered one inch more, the thinner he was, the harder Allen could dominate him, and the more feminine, the more masculine Allen was in contrast.<br />
<br />
As the small blonde girl thought these thoughts, one of her hands slid down to her crotch. The other hand was under her sweater holding her breasts, now sizable mounds. Her nipples were so sensitive, just lightly touching the edge of her areola caused shivers. She touched her crotch, thinking back to Allen&#39;s tongue-work. When she grabbed herself, she imagined her hands as his, even though her dainty hands were a poor imitation of Allen&#39;s<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Allen.&quot; escaped her lips. She was lost in her fantasy.<br />
<br />
Connor breathed heavily, blonde strands of hair across her sweaty forehead. She didn&#39;t want to go back to being a man just yet. What she wanted was Allen, and she wanted him now. She scrambled for her phone to send him a message. &quot;Come. I need you. Now.&quot;</p>
