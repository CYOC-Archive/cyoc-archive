<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For hours on end, you clean the house. You scrub the floors, shine the counters, dust the bookshelves. You were a bit of a slob before the changes, but now, Cici&#39;s instructions have turned your body into the worlds most anal neat freak. Your body scrubs and rubs and spit shines everything in sight, even when can&#39;t imagine it being any cleaner than it already is. You also can&#39;t help but notice how you stick out your ass when you bend over, and lean just enough to expose your cleavage, even though no one is here to enjoy the peep show. Embarrassed and exhausted, you still don&#39;t stop, even when your limbs ache with pain and your hormones scream at you to pleasure yourself. The sun sets, but you don&#39;t stop. The apartment has become the cleanest place you&#39;ve ever seen, and still your body isn&#39;t satisfied. Any chance you had to use the Recorder while Cici isn&#39;t here to interfere is gone. Once again, tears stream down your face, which fall on your jiggling breasts as you scrub down a counter top in the kitchen. As you do, however, the door suddenly swings open, and Cici sways in...with friends to boot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. My. Gosh. Cassie, I like, found the coooolest people at the club!&quot; She exclaims, two strangers hooked on her arms. &quot;You just have to meet them!&quot; It seems this indirect command ends your cleaning frenzy, as you no longer feel compelled to crub down the counter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cici, please listen to me-&quot; You start to say,but she cuts you off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shush! Let me introduce you!&quot; She says with thinly veiled annoyance. Sure enough, your mouth clamps shut mid-sentence. You don&#39;t even try to resist. You know its pointless. Instead, you take stock of the newcomers while Cici introduces them. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, like, this is Kasumi!&quot; she proclaims, wrapping an arm around a skinny Asian woman to her left. Kasumi smiles at you with lidded eyes, seductively. Her pale skin is offset by her dark eyes and makeup, with a button nose a lips coated in black. She wears a shear strapless black dress, one that reveals her average cleavage, but also exposes all of her luscious long legs, ending in black stilettos. You notice a tattoo on her left arm, an elaborate tapestry depicting a dragon. She carries herself with cool confidence, and she shoots you a wink as she takes you in. Your lust, already at a fever pitch, spikes. Unable to vocalize, you can only squirm as you silently orgasm, juices dripping out of your lacy panties as your legs go weak, though you manage to stay standing by leaning on the counter. This is crazy. Your out of control hormones just made you orgasm from a wink! This is getting out of hand. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Cici squeezes the arm of the man to her right. &quot;And this is Ricardo!&quot; Ricardo appears to be Latino, and is wearing a black tank top that reveals his rippling biceps. You notice him ogling you, not even trying to hide it, a wide smile on his face. Above his smile is a thin mustache, a sharp nose, and beady eyes. When you leaned on the counter, you inadvertently leaned over, giving him full view of your ample cleavage. You also notice a bulge protruding from his dark blue athletic shorts. As you stare at his crotch, however, you don&#39;t feel any additional lust. It seems that even though your gender has changed, your sexual preference has not. Though with how quickly your life turned upside down, you aren&#39;t sure how much longer that will be the case. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, like I have the best idea.&quot; Cici continued, ushering Kasumi and Ricardo inside, the two of them taking a seat on the couch you spent several hours freshening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice place you got here.&quot; Kasumi said as she sat, casually folding her legs. Her voice echoed her suave demeanor. She carried herself like she had lived here all her life. You couldn&#39;t help but be attracted to her commanding presence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Real nice.&quot; Ricardo said in a deep but charismatic voice, not hiding the fact that he was still staring directly at your chest with hunger in his eyes. You shifted uncomfortably, still unable to speak. <br />
<br />
Then, Cici drew everyone&#39;s attention by walking over to you and giving a long, deep kiss, her tongue exploring every corner of your mouth for several seconds. Then she quickly disengaged and grabbed your hand, dragging you to the living room with the other two before quickly heading into her room. Left alone with the two and unable to speak, you smiled weakly at them, not sure what else to do. Kasumi returned your smile with one of her own, one that exuded confidence. Ricardo licked his lips before awkwardly clearing his throat and looking away. It seemed even his leering had limits. <br />
<br />
Cici suddenly burst into the room...with the Recorder in her hands. Oh no. &quot;So I like, have this awesome voice recorder.&quot; Oh no. &quot;And it like, totally grants wishes!&quot; Oh no no no no! &quot;But it , like, doesn&#39;t always get them right. Like, whatever, point is, we can have a ton of fun with this thing. So, here&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna do. We&#39;re gonna play spin the bottle, but like, instead of kissing or whatever, we&#39;re gonna get a chance to make a wish with the Recorder! Whoever the bottle lands on gets to make a wish!&quot; Kasumi&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change, but you could tell she was skeptical. Ricardo looked like he was much more interested in something else. If only they knew what danger they were in. <br />
<br />
As Cici headed into the kitchen to grab a bottle, Kasumi returned her gaze to you. &quot;You&#39;re awfully quiet.&quot; she said, her calm voice soothing to you, despite the horror you felt at the situation. You wished you could warn her, but you could only gesture helplessly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Cassie just being a buzzkill.&quot; Cici said as she returned with a beer bottle. &quot;If the bottle lands on her, she can make a wish, but otherwise, shush!&quot; Great. Just great. Cici ripped the cap of the bottle before the began draining its contents into her mouth, tilting her head back and allowing it to cascade into mouth, large portions of it falling down her cleavage, soaking her shirt and making her nipples hard, all while gyrating her hips provocatively. &quot;Alright!&quot; Kasumi exclaimed, clearly enjoying the show. &quot;Chug, chug, chug!&quot; Ricardo chanted while slapping his leg, also clearly enjoying himself. Sure enough, Cici downed the whole bottle. Great! Stupid and drunk? Who knows what kind of catastrophic wishes she might make. Anxious dread fills your entire body, but you can&#39;t stop the calamity that is about to occur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok...&quot; Cici says with a drunken slur. &quot;Lets...get...started!&quot; With that, she quickly takes a seat between you and Ricardo, and gives the bottle a spin on the coffee table in the middle of the furniture. The pit of your stomach falls away as the bottle spins. Kasumi looks on with apprehension, but also anticipation. Ricardo hollers and claps his hands. Cici drunkenly puts her arm around you and giggles. You simply brace yourself. The bottle spin slows, eventually landing on...</p>
