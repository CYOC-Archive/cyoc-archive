<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt scratched his head, a bit perplexed to say the least. For one, where did the other horse come from? Secondly, where did Julie go? She wouldn&#39;t just leave Marabelle behind. As much as he disliked riding that horse, he knew she was important to Julie.<br />
<br />
Then a thought came to him. What if she was kidnapped? If there were two horses here, then the other either wandered over, or someone rode it over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Julie!&quot; he called out, only getting a reaction from the stallion. &quot;Not you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay....okay. What to do...the stables are too far from here,&quot; he glanced at the horses. He did have a saddle now. And he probably could get around pretty fast by riding one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, fine,&quot; Matt said dismissively to the affectionate stallion. &quot;You like me so much, then help me find Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had no idea how to put said saddle onto Julie, but after much trial and error, he managed to get it onto him, and climbed up onto top of the powerful stallion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Cupid watched from the treeline. &quot;Well....this is an interesting love triangle. Let&#39;s spice it up a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, boy....go! Err....yip yip! Hi yah!&quot; Matt shouted out, trying to get Julie to go. She...err...he felt joy at Matt riding him and complied, galloping off, and at great speeds. It was enough that Cupid had to put some effort into hitting his target. The &#39;yeowch!&#39; emitted from the boy told him he nailed the shot, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah! The fuck!!&quot; Matt cried out in pain. &quot;Rrgh...stupid bees!&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s possible Cupid may have shot that one a bit too hard, but the deity shrugged. The harder their hit, the harder they fall in love.<br />
<br />
Matt held on tight to the stallion. He had no idea it was Julie, yet, felt some sort of attachment to him. Especially after that bee sting. He was afraid for his girlfriend, and what could have happened to her. He was afraid he&#39;d be all alone in the world again without her. Some tears started to fall, but he quickly did his best to wipe them away.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...stop that...don&#39;t cry, damnit. You&#39;re strong. You have to be strong for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
But who would be strong for him? This stallion was admittingly a lot nicer than Marabelle. He kept the ride comfy, and adjusted his pace when needed instead of making a mad countryside dash. Not to mention how obedient he was being. What a good horse.<br />
<br />
Matt felt a little sweaty as he continued to ride, especially down in his lower regions. It was summer, sure, but his groin was feeling like a dutch oven down there. God, how bad did Marabelle mess him up? He winced. He needed some water...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...pitstop first. Can you take me to the pond, boy? Wait...who am I kidding you don&#39;t underst- woah!&quot; At his words, like the horse understood English, Julie took him over to the nearby freshwater pond. &quot;Huh...good job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt got off and walked over to the waters. It wasn&#39;t exactly the brightest move to drink pond water, but the sweatiness was getting unbearable and he didn&#39;t think he could make it back to the stable for a drink. He quickly dunked his head in the water, then his rear.<br />
<br />
He groaned, feeling pain all over his back, which forced him to get out of the water. He held himself up on the ground on all fours, trying to brace through the pain going through his body. It looked to him like the ground was sinking away or he was floating up as his head was filled with nausea. <br />
<br />
He started to smell strange scents too. Not bad scents necessarily. In fact, rather....nice. The pain stopped for a few moments, enough for him to notice the scents were coming off of the stallion nearby. Strong, protective masculine scents. Scent of stallion. How he knew this, he wasn&#39;t sure. Those words didn&#39;t usually have a scent...other than maybe deodorant and &#39;manly musk&#39;, but this was different; more primal and raw. And for some reason...it made his worries start to fade a little. He would find Julie, he was sure of it now. He just needed to stay with this stallion.<br />
<br />
He went to go over to him, but found the pain returning and groaned as he felt his &#39;boys&#39; start to do things...things they weren&#39;t supposed to do. Rather than getting erect...he felt as though his equipment was getting smaller, and it felt like it was sinking into him. He noticed the stallion getting closer, but thought nothing of it until he felt something large connect with his rear.<br />
<br />
His quickly shrinking genitals were suddenly given a boost in their change as Matt felt the stallion&#39;s rod penetrate into his newly forming cunt. He grunted and tried to break free, but the stallion was very strong...and...his scent. God, his scent. Matt felt intoxicated as he just stood there...taking it. He wasn&#39;t sure how long he was there, but by the time a part of him began to try to break free again, he noticed his face was elongating, and he felt his ears to be much higher than they should have been. Black patches of fur had started appearing on his body as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-need to get up...&quot; he grunted, trying to break free from the stallion. Either the stallion was merciful or Matt had enough willpower, but he managed to slide out from under the stallion. He couldn&#39;t stand back up though, as his spine was forcing him into an all fours position. &quot;What&#39;s....what&#39;s happening t-to me...?&quot;<br />
<br />
He threw up whatever he ate this morning as he felt his body stretch and bulge, his body fat growing and bubbling around him, making him thicker and larger. The black fur slowly started spreading more, as he felt his short brown hair grow longer as well, cascading down his neck and all the way to his back.<br />
<br />
His clothes getting very tight at this point, and Matt tried to pull them off in hysterical desperation, but his hands felt very numb. Taking a look at them, he saw why. His fingers were melting together, forming into solid hooves.<br />
<br />
He...she...whinnied in fear as she felt her feet do the same in turn. Wait, whinny? She tried to talk, but her words only came out as neighs. But she could understand her words still, and she heard another&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Matt...I&#39;m...I&#39;m so sorry...&quot; came a neigh from the stallion.<br />
<br />
Matt, feeling very vulnerable and afraid, looking behind her to see the imposing stallion. &quot;Y-you...what did you do to me? Turn me back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how....Matt...it&#39;s me...Julie...&quot; the stallion said. &quot;And...I don&#39;t know how...&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s heartbeat raced, for several reasons. One, out of fear, and two...for the stallion. Even more now that she knew who it was. <br />
<br />
&quot;J-Julie? You...you were the stallion?&quot; She felt comfortable near him and managed to get back up onto all fours. <br />
<br />
He nodded, his rod twitching at seeing the gorgeous mare and taking in her wondrous scents. &quot;But...we&#39;re together now at least, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But as horses...&quot; she sighed, subconsciously lifting her tail and winking her pussy. &quot;I feel really warm...all I can think about is something in me...I....I hate to ask this...but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll help,&quot; Julie instantly agreed. &quot;Come over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt obeyed her stallion and trotted over, turning herself around and showing herself off for her stallion. Her stallion, that felt so right to her. She was his mare, and he her stallion.<br />
<br />
Julie planted his hooves onto Matt&#39;s back, lining himself up before taking the long, thick plunge into her, eliciting many whinnies from the virgin mare. Matt&#39;s mind was filled with thoughts of a lifetime as a mare, from fillyhood to marehood, being the daughter of a racing horse champion and being in the process of being trained for a new race. But for now, she was Julie&#39;s mare, and she was content with that.<br />
<br />
Marabelle, however, was not content with being ignored.</p>
