<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Other individuals who chose to be uplifted did so for more invisible reasons. While so many wanted to be stronger, faster, beautiful if not healed, others found that becoming certain Animalians eased their mental disabilities greatly, whether they be depression or of anxiety.<br />
<br />
One woman arrived on her scheduled day with no less than terror running through her system. Brandy, a twenty-five year old college student, suffered from intense anxiety that held her back from most things, such as strenuous work and high-tension courses. When she&#39;d first learned of Project Phoenix from her mother, she tentatively applied, before the professionals contacted her with various offers almost too exciting to be anything less than interest.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d arrived with minimal things to ease her stress, opting for a loose top and a skirt that could make room for whatever would happen to her. Stepping through the doors, she was greeted by a doctor and nurse, standing behind a comfortable looking wheelchair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brandy, yes?&quot; The doctor asked.<br />
<br />
The woman silently nodded. All around her, animalians new and old wandered, some getting used to their new bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, have a seat. We understand this might be a lot for you, so we only wish to make this procedure as comfortable as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Brandy didn&#39;t give much more than acknowledgment. She joined them in the chair, and was pressed back towards what had to be the medical and examination rooms. She still hadn&#39;t been given her options as far as species, but seeing as the doctor was very focused on helping her, Brandy didn&#39;t worry much on what she would become.<br />
<br />
&quot;We expressed concern over your condition, and in looking for donors, we found many who were interested in easing you into your new form. Now, we did our best to look for species in which anxiety is lessened if not better, and we made sure to contact therapists to see what would be healthy for you in your particular case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what did they say?&quot; Brandy&#39;s voice escaped as a whisper short of a gasp. The nurse placed a hand on her shoulder and neck as if to bring comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;They allowed us to provide our best choice as long as you agree to it and that you return to an approved therapist following the procedure.&quot; <br />
<br />
They turned in what had to be the final room, nothing short of a medical facility. Here, a recliner and bed had been brought in against a window looking over the back garden. Animalians fed and grazed outside, and soft music came from unseen speakers above. While she may have been frightened, Brandy found her anxiety dwindling away. These conditions were those she could be in control of; to her, there was nothing at this point to fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;The donor will be joining us soon, but as of now, we just wish for you to relax and rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, doctor,&quot; she said. A soft roll of her shoulders let out a few kinks and cracks.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed while the nurse and doctor worked on something separately in the room&#39;s front. Paperwork, maybe. As she watched them, Brandy rumbled and held interest. Her breathing grew deeper. The room felt lighter, brighter even.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door brought the only course of anxiety Brandy had felt since walking in, before the door opened a crack and a muzzle poked in. &quot;Is she ready, doctor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, James. Yes, I think she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandy turned her attention to the door as it opened to reveal a tall albeit built lion, mane rushing down his back and covering both his shoulders. He wore simple clothes, like her, and smiled warmly as he made his way towards her. &quot;Hi,&quot; he said with a small wave. &quot;You doing okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said, voice slowing out into another rumble. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I have to admit, when they told me about your condition, I was unsure what exactly anxiety was. Took them some time to explain what it all meant.&quot; The lion, James, came and knelt beside the wheelchair without touching or getting too close to her. &quot;Where I was raised, we didn&#39;t need to fear anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;James was one of the first lions affected locally in a zoo,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;Out of all our candidates, he seemed the best to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m glad to,&quot; James said. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful, if I may say so.<br />
<br />
Brandy blushed, and feeling an itch take over, she smiled and shimmied in her seat. &quot;A sweet talker, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They all can&#39;t be perfect,&quot; the nurse said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she...know, doctor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;Brandy, we didn&#39;t want to shock you, but while we rolled you in, James asked us to put a low dosage patch on you to begin your change slowly. The uplifting&#39;s already begun, if you dare to look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like a wave, the woman&#39;s heart sunk. She glanced down and found that with the itching, layers of golden hair had begun to crawl up her body. Her aching neck and shoulders seemed thicker than before with new muscle and tendon. Her anxiety, as promised, had already begun to dwindle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was only a suggestion. I just thought it&#39;d be much for them to send you through the process too soon,&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
Brandy thought she should refute this, or be mad in some way of feeling invaded, but watching the golden fur race up, feeling her nose and lips tingle, not a single thought of anger came to her.<br />
<br />
She watched as the changes progressed, changing her face into that of a fierce lioness with matching form beneath. Her torso grew lean albeit strong, breasts larger as though she were pregnant. Her spine cracked as a leonine tail extended out from behind her.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel, Brandy?” the doctor asked. He and the nurse stood back and against the counters, while James stayed closed, holding the new lion’s paw.<br />
<br />
“Amazing,” she said. Between a growl, a rumbling purr, and a sigh, Brandy couldn’t escape what felt like bliss taking over her body and mind. Worry faded, as confidence and strength replaced it. To her new and shining eyes, everyone seemed beneath her. Not in a bad way. She simply didn’t feel threatened or concerned by them. <br />
<br />
“I think you’re almost done,” James said. A claw pinched her shoulder as a medical patch was removed. The patch that had changed her into a newly made queen.<br />
<br />
“Done? It was just getting to be good,” she said, almost laughing.<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded. “I’m glad to see that the process is helping. When we finish, we’ll have you go in to discuss yourself with one of our counselors and see what changes have been made elsewhere.”<br />
<br />
“And what happens after that?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re free to do as you please. Do you feel you’ll need some assistance back home?”<br />
<br />
Brandy didn’t even think about it. Prior to this change, she would have wanted someone to call in and check on her, if not simply ask how she was feeling. Now, she felt she could do so much all on her own without any need of intrusion.<br />
<br />
Except for one. Glancing down, the lioness found James, her helpful donor, looking up at her with warm, welcoming eyes. His tongue lapped at his chops. “Maybe. Could James assist me, perhaps?”<br />
<br />
“That’s up to him. James?” The doctor smiled behind his clipboard and recorder.<br />
<br />
“I’d be glad to, my queen.” The lion purred a deep and heavy rumble.<br />
<br />
Brandy finished her time at Project Phoenix, as promised, with an evaluation by the counselor. Results would be sent to her later, but she was eased off to her vehicle by the doctor and James, the latter seeming concerned on whether Brandy was comfortable or not.<br />
<br />
All in all, another successful uplifting thanks to Project Phoenix. Brandy’s results and new life as a lioness will prove valuable for further research on uplifted subjects and invisible, hidden disabilities. The work itself, however, could not be done without the support of Animalian donors, many who are willing to help their new friends begin a new life.</p>
