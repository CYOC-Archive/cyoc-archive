<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I can&#39;t edit the content of the chapter now, so I&#39;m noting that after further examining their pictures, I don&#39;t think culpeos have slit pupils, alas.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wow, look at you!&quot; Mr. Benson seemed oddly impressed by the slim young culpeo morph sitting on his (former) daughter&#39;s bed. And when he noticed her load soaking into the carpet, he whistled. &quot;Oh damn.&quot; Although Shari blushed beneath her fur, her father&#39;s exclamation was one of approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dear.&quot; He laughed a little ruefully. &quot;But it looks like you&#39;re realy potent --&quot; He cleared his throat. &quot;You&#39;re not too upset by being a guy now, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... no, not really Dad.&quot; Shari rubbed the back of her head. &quot;It&#39;s just... awkward, hearing you talk like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, sorry. At least it looks like you enjoyed the experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daaad...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. Do you want to talk about it?&quot; He gestured at her crotch. &quot;About... you know, what it&#39;s like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no. Not right now.&quot; Actually, she <i>did,</i> but despite the confused rush of pride at his praise, Shari just felt way too weird talking with her dad about being a man. &quot;Just let me borrow some of your clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; He tossed a couple of boxers onto the bed beside her. &quot;See how you feel about those.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shari got up and tried a pair on. They felt... noticeable, in an odd but not bad way, against her balls and sheath. On the other hand, the band pushed up uncomfortably against her tail. But she guessed it was bearable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Mr. Benson also noticed the tail issue, but it seemed he wasn&#39;t going to mention it if she wasn&#39;t. At least, not directly. &quot;Pants are going to be an issue. Also, I think you might be a bit taller than me, but definitely not as broad. What are you, some kind of fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. A culpeo fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I must say, it suits you. You make a handsome young man.&quot; His voice grew almost wistful. &quot;How long did you say this would last?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, I&#39;ll go see if I can get some things that might fit you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Long Ts and loose sweat pants, worn in reverse so her tail poked out through the fly, were found to be serviceable if not comfortable. Her father showed her into the master bedroom, as her parents had a full-length mirror. She marveled at herself, wishing she could have had the view naked but not willing to undress after the struggle to get the clothes on. Even in the slightly off-fitting clothes, though, he did look handsome. <br />
<br />
And more than that. Predatory slit pupils set in deep golden-brown irises gave him a dangerous, predatory look that he found very satisfying.<br />
<br />
<i>No more scared little nerd here.</i><br />
<br />
He was mimicking a yawn to admire his teeth and long tongue when Mrs. Benson came in. Veronica was not quite as thrilled as Joel Senior, and seemed convinced that her daughter would not want to be a son. It wasn&#39;t until her reminded her, only half-joking, that there was nothing wrong with being a boy that she relented.<br />
<br />
Then Shari retreated to her room. As soon as she locked the door, she heard a text notification from her phone. She walked over, curious; she didn&#39;t exactly have a lot of friends.<br />
<br />
<i>hey Shari</i><br />
<br />
It was Tim. That made sense; the two weren&#39;t exactly close, but he was one of the few people in the class that treated her like a human being.<br />
<br />
Hey</i><br />
she texted back.<br />
<br />
<i>u take ur pill yet?</i><br />
<br />
Of course. He&#39;d probably taken his as well! She began to feel excited again as she realised there were other people out there she could legit share this experience with.<br />
<i>Yeah.<br />
<br />
whatd u turn in2<br />
<br />
A culpeo fox</i><br />
She hesitated. <br />
<i>A male<br />
<br />
u changed gender?</i><br />
<br />
She grimaced slightly, wishing his text messages weren&#39;t so spartan.<br />
<i>Yes<br />
<br />
thats cool</i><br />
Her heart lifted a little at his response. She started to ask if maybe she could come over, if maybe he could tell her how to handle this... feeling in her loins -- her balls were already starting to feel full again, and thinking about it was making her penis start to press out against her underwear. But Tim sent another message before she could.<br />
<br />
<i>wats a culpeo fox</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; She smiled to herself, pleased that she had known the rather unfamiliar canid just by looking at herself.<br />
<i>It&#39;s a species of South American canine.<br />
Some people consider them foxes, some don&#39;t.<br />
<br />
weird<br />
but u kno, i think im some kind of canine 2</i><br />
A pause. Then,<br />
<i>could u mabe come over and help me figure out wat i am?<br />
<br />
Yeah sure!<br />
<br />
thx</i><br />
<br />
She was elated at the invitation, but she struggled with herself about whether she should make her own concerns known. Absently her hand drifted down to the bulge in his pants, then she jerked when she felt the touch on her unfamiliar length -- which jumped to full mast at the contact, red tip poking proudly above the faded green of the sweat pants. <i>It feels so... strong...</i> With a strange burst of confidence, he typed,<br />
<br />
<i>And maybe u can help me with being a guy.</i><br />
<br />
There was another pause. Fears that Tim thought she was being stupid -- that he wouldn&#39;t understand how hard this powerful feeling was to adjust to for a former girl -- began to fill her mind. She put her hand over her eyes. Then the phone chimed again. She looked.<br />
<br />
<i>would love 2<br />
cy soon?<br />
<br />
Yeah. I&#39;ll be over ASAP.</i><br />
<br />
She stood up, taking a few deep breaths. She knew, more-or-less, that if she calmed down (and stopped thinking about it) her cock would go back to sleep. Since she <i>was</i> thinking about it, it took a few minutes, but eventually it had retreated enough that she could ignore it as she walked. She snatched up phone and purse and scampered downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going over to Tim&#39;s okay bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey --!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you Mom! I might spend the night!&quot;<br />
<br />
She had once or twice back in elementary school, before it became awkward for a girl to spend the night at a boy&#39;s house. Now she supposed it didn&#39;t matter.<br />
<br />
She drove as fast as legally possible, praying constantly that nobody saw an anthropomorphic exotic animal driving a car through the suburbs; fortunately it was dusk and nobody was out. About halfway there her phone, sitting on the passenger seat, chimed again; she glanced and saw it was Tim asking if she was coming. She chose to ignore it since responding would slow her down, but wondered why he was in such a rush.</p>
