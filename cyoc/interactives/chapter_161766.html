<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where do you suppose all the guys went to, Jessica?&quot; James asked as he continued to relax in his chair. <br />
&quot;They’re around here, somewhere&#39;s.&quot; Jessica replied as she lined up for her next shot. &quot;What do you care?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica then executed a masterful trick shot that landed the 3-Ball in the right hand corner pocket. &quot;You’re havin’ a good time, ain’t ya?&quot; Jessica asked as she took another puff of her cigar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh, I sure am.&quot; James said happily as he watched on in awe of his friend&#39;s skills. Finishing her cigar, Jessica put it and out and remarked: &quot;Oh man! This is life, huh, Jamie?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! It sure is!&quot; James exclaimed as he took several more puffs on his cigar. &quot;Ah, you smoke like me grandmother!&quot; Jessica said sarcastically. &quot;Come on, take a big drag, like this!&quot; <br />
Jessica then lit another cigar and inhaled it deeply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Jess&quot; James said as he tried to imitate Jessica’s actions. He took a very big drag on his cigar, only for it to cause his face to turn red and his eyes to water.<br />
<br />
Jessica took another whiff of her cigar. &quot;Hey, some fun, Jamie?&quot; James nodded, albeit nauseously. <br />
Jessica relaxed as she continued the game of billiards. But then, when Jessica grabbed her mug and took a swig of her beer, unknown to her, her ears grew both furry and long and into that of a donkey&#39;s. <br />
<br />
James who sat in a curious wooden chair that had the face of a donkey carved into it, could hardly believe his eyes at the sight of Jessica and looked down at his mug of beer with questions as to whether it was really happening or if it was the booze making him hallucinate. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don’t know how to smoke, Jamie!&quot; Jessica said as she turned her attention back to her game, still unaware of her brand new donkey ears. As Jessica leaned herself against the pool table and took her next shot, she was completely unaware of the brown donkey tail that sprouted out of her  tight and round butt, which tore a hole through her jeans. <br />
<br />
James once more looked on in shock, this time staring at the smoking cigar in his hand as a possible culprit behind what he was seeing. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happen with you? Are you tired of smoking? Ha ha, I knew you are a mommy baby that never has smoked before&quot;, Jessica said as she strode over to the other side of the pool table and took her next shot. &quot;What do you think I look like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An ASS?,&quot; Jessica exclaimed as she turned to face James, completely unaware that her head and face were now that of a donkey&#39;s, complete with a tan muzzle and a mane of spiky black hair a top her head. <br />
<br />
Whether he was hallucinating or not, James couldn&#39;t contain himself any longer. &quot;You sure do!” he exclaimed in amusement as he sprung up from his seat laughing at Jessica&#39;s new appearance.  “Ha ha ha ha ha HEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAWW! HEE HAW! HEE HAW!” <br />
<br />
Jessica, now amused herself, strode over to James with a big grin on her donkey face. &quot;What a freak!. You laugh like a donkey! Ha, ha, ha .… HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! HEEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAWW!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica froze in her tracks at the sound of herself now braying like a donkey too. She quickly covered her mouth with her hands and turned to James with a look of worry on her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did... did that... come outta me?&quot; she asked, hoping James would say no. James nodded his head up and down, confirming to Jessica that she did in fact bray too. With this revelation, Jessica raised her hand and felt her mouth, quickly discovering that she now had a muzzle instead of her little and cute normal mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh!&quot; she let out softly as her eyes widened in alarm. She then felt the sides of her face with both of her hands and discovered that her once perfect and pale face was now all furry like an animal. &quot;Huh?&quot; she exclaimed in response. <br />
<br />
Finally Jessica reached up and felt her ears, which were now long like a donkey&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Jessica asked as she ran towards the mirror that sat next to the bar, desperate to see what was happening to her. <br />
“AAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHH!!!!” Jessica shouted when she stepped in front of the mirror, she became deeply frightened by the donkey&#39;s head and face that was now her own staring back at her. And with that very image of herself -- Jessica began screaming in terror at what was happening to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;My face…my beautiful face!!! I have a face of a beast!!! &quot; Jessica yelled as she franticly ran around the room. &quot;Help! Help! Somebody help! I&#39;ve been double-crossed!&quot; <br />
<br />
James could only watch on in fear, completely powerless to help Jessica undergo a frightening transformation. Jessica ran straight out the doors of the Pool Hall and out into the streets of the island amusement park. &quot;Help! Somebody please HELP! I don’t wanna be a donkey!!! I’m not an animal!! I’m not an animal!!&quot; she shouted. <br />
<br />
Jessica suddenly stopped dead in her tracks and saw that the park seemed to be completely abandoned. <br />
<br />
The lights of the Park were all out. The Rides were completely motionless. The Animatronics were completely still and silent. Trash littered the streets. And most shocking of all -- there was NO ONE in sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Impossible!&quot; Jessica exclaimed. &quot;There had to be over a hundred or more other guys here! Where&#39;d they all go?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica then turned and ran back to the Pool Hall, which was the only source of light outside of the moon. Jessica hoped that maybe James could help her.<br />
<br />
Jessica rushed into the Pool Hall and fell on her knees in front of James. <br />
<br />
&quot;James, please, you&#39;ve gotta help me!&quot; she begged. &quot;Be a pal! Please! Please! Don’t let me to be a donkey! I don’t wanna be a donkey! I’m not a donkey!!!&quot; she said crying.<br />
<br />
As Jessica moved to touch her friend, she suddenly let out a cry of pain as she felt her hands forcefully clench into fists and quickly transform into the hooves of a donkey. <br />
<br />
“My hands!!! My hands!!! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOO!  Jessica rose to her feet as she felt her body transforming, growing furrier by the second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!&quot; Jessica cried. &quot;MAMA!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica was then forced to the floor on all fours! She screamed as she fully transformed into a jenny and her screams soon became the frantic and panicked brays of a very scared donkey. <br />
<br />
&quot;HAW HEE HAW HEE HAW!!&quot; she brayed in terror. <br />
<br />
Jessica ran back to the pool hall mirror and saw the little brown donkey he had fully become. His mind now completely unhinged in terror, Jessica kicked the mirror with his hooves, shattering it into pieces that scattered around the room.<br />
<br />
Jessica then ran around the room in a panic, kicking chairs and toppling tables, causing beer mugs -- playing cards -- and poker chips to fall to the floor in a mess. <br />
<br />
As she kicked and kicked, Jessica&#39;s clothes came off of her and soon she was just a naked donkey that no longer had a need for clothes. <br />
<br />
With one last glance at James, who was starting to transform into a donkey as well, Jessica once more fled the pool hall. She ran out into the streets as fast as her new hooves could carry her, braying wildly in the night air. <br />
<br />
She ran to the park entrance, where the large wooden gate doors that led to the Pleasure Island ferry was. When she got there she was in disbelief. <br />
<br />
The doors to the ferry were completely shut and barred to prevent any escape! <br />
<br />
Frightened but undeterred, Jessica ran up to the gate and got up on her hind legs. She then kicked and pounded on the doors with her hooves, desperately trying to get someone&#39;s attention. <br />
<br />
Tears streamed down Jessica’s face as she kicked, pounded and franticly brayed: &quot;HAW HEE HAW!! HEE HAW!!&quot; <br />
<br />
After several minutes of this and still no response, Jessica fell back on all fours, now all tired out. Suddenly there was a sound behind her. Jessica, expecting that it was James, whirled around to face him. <br />
<br />
Instead what she saw was not his friend but the looming shadow of a man that was reaching out to grab her. <br />
<br />
Jessica brayed loudly!</p>
