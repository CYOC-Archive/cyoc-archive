<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“A skunk, huh?” Sam asked. “Well, it could be a lot worse. You could’ve become something like a star-nosed mole.”<br />
<br />
“I…I don’t think skunks are s-so bad,” Todd added. “I-I‘ve always thought th-that they were p-pretty cool…”<br />
<br />
Sam and Todd had gone down to the dining hall and met up with Milo and Dare to have breakfast together. They mostly spent their time eating and talking about the events that had occurred the previous night. When they finished eating, the four of them made their way back to Milo and Dare’s dorm room to take pictures for Milo’s project. <br />
<br />
“Thanks…I guess when you put it like that, things could’ve been a whole lot worse,” Dare said, suddenly feeling thankful that the world was turning him into a skunk and not something utterly hideous.<br />
<br />
Milo unlocked the door to his dorm room and ushered everyone inside before going in himself and closing the door behind him. “Please, make yourselves at home while I set things up,” he said to Todd and Sam. Todd sat off to the side as Milo began setting up his camera and tripod. When he went to move the chair in front of the camera, Sam noticed and beat him to it. After setting up his laptop and plugging it into the camera, Milo fiddled with a few settings before nodding in satisfaction. <br />
<br />
“Okay, everything’s set up and good to go,” he said. “We’ll make adjustments as necessary. So…who wants to go first?” <br />
<br />
“I’ll go first to get it over with,” Dare spoke up. “That fine with you two?” Both Todd and Sam nodded simultaneously as Dare began to strip. Out of politeness, Todd turned around before he could take his pants and boxers off. When Dare was completely nude, Milo quickly make some adjustments to the camera. <br />
<br />
“Okay Dare…turn around for me so we can see your fur and stripe, okay?” Milo directed. “Okay, now…put a hand on your hip…yeah just like that!” Milo quickly snapped a few photos before pulling them up on his laptop. “Alright, you can put your clothes back on now.”<br />
<br />
Dare quickly put his boxers back on before walking over to the laptop to look at his pictures. Just then, Milo’s phone made a notification sound effect. Looking down at the phone, Milo saw that he’d gotten a text from Ollie. <br />
<br />
<i>Had a little incident at the coffee shop. You still at the dining hall?</i><br />
<br />
Shit. He’d forgotten that Ollie was going to meet them. He quickly texted back a response. <br />
<br />
<i>No, we’re back at my dorm. Todd and Sam are getting their pictures taken. You can swing by if you want.</i><br />
<br />
He didn’t need to wait long for a response. <br />
<br />
<i>Sure. Got a friend with me. He’s a fuckin cutie.</i><br />
<br />
Sam stepped in front of the camera. Todd turned around as Sam began taking off his shirt. Curiosity getting the better of him, Todd moved up next to Milo in order to get a better view. Sam slowly took off his shorts, revealing the large tent in his boxers. <br />
<br />
“Hey Todd, remember earlier when I said there was something else that changed?” Sam asked, a sly grin plastered on his face. Todd stared at the bulge in Sam’s boxers.<br />
<br />
“You mean…?”<br />
<br />
Sam nodded before pulling down his boxers, revealing his fully erect nine-inch feline cock. Todd’s eyes widened as he stared at his roommate’s massive cock. Sam smirked at Todd’s reaction. <br />
<br />
“I take it you like what you see?” he asked. Todd nodded wordlessly, and Sam laughed. “Alright Milo, how do you want me posing?”<br />
<br />
“I…uh…” Milo shook himself out of his daze. “So, I was thinking that you should sit down in the chair and…put your left leg up on your right knee. Now move it just a tiny bit…perfect! Now we’ve got a good view of your cock. Now, lean back a tiny bit and put your hands behind your head. Show off those meaty biceps of yours, okay? Great! Now just move your tail ever so slightly to the right…perfect! Stay just like that!”<br />
<br />
Milo began snapping some pictures of Sam’s body. After a few minutes, Milo nodded in satisfaction and moved to his laptop to pull up the photos. All the while, Todd had his eyes glued to Sam’s cock. The jock put his boxers back on and rustled Todd’s hair.<br />
<br />
“I knew you’d like it, little buddy,” Sam said. “Now it’s your turn.”<br />
<br />
Todd nodded and stood up, his face completely red from blushing. He stood in front of the camera, took a deep breath, and then began to take off his shirt. <br />
<br />
“You know you don’t have to do the photoshoot nude, right Todd?” Milo asked, giving the shy man a sympathetic look. <br />
<br />
“Yeah man, just because Sam and I did it nude doesn’t mean you have to,” Dare spoke up (which honestly startled Todd, as he’d forgotten he was there). Todd started to lower his shirt, but he shook his head and started to take it off again. <br />
<br />
“No, I’m doing it nude,” he said, fully taking his shirt off and neatly putting it aside. “It’s only fair that I do.” Todd slid off his shorts, leaving him in his boxers. At this point, his heart was pounding. He was about to fully strip in front of his crush and two of his friends. He was scared beyond belief. As he slipped his fingers beneath the hem of his boxers, he felt himself freeze. <br />
<br />
<i>Just do it clothed coward.<br />
<br />
Can’t even go nude in front of your crush? How do you expect yourself to have sex with him?<br />
<br />
You have no courage. How can you be expected to be a wolf?</i><br />
<br />
Todd yanked down on his boxers, exposing himself fully. His heart was pounding faster than it ever had before. But it wasn’t because he was nervous. He felt…exhilarated. He looked up and saw Sam smiling in approval. The feeling he got from seeing his approval…it was better than anything Todd had ever felt in his life. He didn’t notice the pressure building at the base of his spine until the feeling of fur touching his bare skin made Todd turn his head. <br />
<br />
<i>A tail. He had a fucking tail.</i><br />
<br />
It was large and rather fluffy, completely covered in pitch black fur. He reached back and felt it, absolutely amazed by how soft the fur was. <br />
<br />
“Hey…you done?” <br />
<br />
Todd looked up and realized that Milo had been waiting to take a picture of him the entire time. Shit. <br />
<br />
“S-Sorry!” Todd apologized, his face turning red. “I don’t know what h-happened. I-I…I just got so n-nervous and I c-couldn’t move and then I c-could and then I had a tail and-“<br />
<br />
“It’s okay man, really,” Milo said. “I’ve dealt with people being nervous to take nudes before.” Dare gave him a dirty look, to which Milo responded by sticking his tongue out. “Now if you’re ready, I’m gonna have you sit down in the chair. Now spread your legs so we can see your dick, okay! Come on, don’t give me that look! Alright, there! Now just relax your body…put a hand behind your head…perfect!”<br />
<br />
Milo snapped a few pictures, eventually moving over to the computer. Todd stood up and put his boxers back on and walked over to where Sam and Milo stood. <br />
<br />
“Did I look good?” He asked, to which Sam replied by simply scratching behind his ears. Todd let his instincts take over. His tail wagged rapidly behind him, his right leg began twitching, and his tongue lolled out of his mouth again. Milo was going to ask which pictures Todd liked best (as well as share the fact that he’d taken a few pictures of him while his tail grew in), but he figured he’d just tell him later. He didn’t want to ruin this adorable moment.</p>
