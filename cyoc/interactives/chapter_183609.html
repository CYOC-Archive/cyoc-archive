<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Mr. Powers has left, a dumbfounded Max stands in the empty hallway, &#39;I got to get that device back,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;first: Ricky would kill me and second: who knows what might happen if Mr. Powers figures the device out.&#39; So, the former boy starts to head to the principals office, he soon arrives and lifts his hand to knock on the door. Max hesitates, but then he takes a deep breath and knocks on the door.<br />
<br />
“Come in,” he hears the principal call.<br />
<br />
Max opens the door, “M-Mister Powers,” he asks as he sticks his head into the office, “I... um... I hope I am not b-bothering you.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers looks up from his desk, Max can see the device lying in front of the principal, “Miss Evans,” the 40-year-old man says, “what can I help you with? If you are planning to beg for this... thing, god knows for what it is and for what ever reason you brought it to school, back: I must disappoint you.”<br />
<br />
Max closes the door behind him and walks up to the desk, “pl-please, sir,” he starts, “I am really sorry for bringing it to school. B-But I really need it back, my mom will kill me if she is unable to watch her shows for a week.”<br />
<br />
The principal leans back in his chair, crossing his arms, “you can&#39;t fool me, young lady,” he says, “this thing is NOT a TV-remote.”<br />
<br />
Max starts to panic, “it... it is,” he lies, “it... um... it is a special, TV-remote.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers shakes his head, “you have always been a bad liar, Maxine,” he says, then he leans forward, “I&#39;ll make you a deal,” he then says. Max looks at the principal, “if you tell me the truth and what this thing is, I MIGHT give it back to you. It seems to mean a lot to you.”<br />
<br />
Max stares at the principal, &#39;I can&#39;t tell him anything about the Chronivac,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;who knows what he might do.&#39;<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers senses that “Maxine” is struggling and seemingly conflicted, “why aren&#39;t you willing to tell me what really is going on?”<br />
<br />
Max thinks of a plausible story, “um... I... I promised my sister Nikki, not to tell anyone,” he says, “i-if she&#39;d find out I lost it... sh-she&#39;ll kill me.” Max looks up at mr. Powers, “so, pl-please just give it back,” he says, “I... I promise to make s-sure that we&#39;ll never bring it b-back to school.”<br />
<br />
The principal sighs and gets up from his chair, he picks up the device and starts to walk around his desk, Max&#39; hopes are high that he has finally persuaded Mr. Powers to hand out the device. Instead however, Mr. Powers stops in front of Max. “Listen miss Evans,” he says, “you should know that lying to me is not healthy,” he sternly states. Max gulps, he knows all to well how Mr. Powers can get when he finds out that he had been played. Mr. Powers notices the worried and almost fearful expression on the “girl&#39;s” face. “I promise, if you tell me the truth, I will keep it a secret and hand out this thing to you,” the man says, “your sister will never find out that I took it from you. So, either you tell me and get this thing back... OR you walk out that door and come back at the end of the school week to retrieve it and risk having your sister and mother hate you for a month, at least.” The principal looks at Max, “so, what will it be, miss Evans?”<br />
<br />
Max stares at the principal, &#39;I seem to have no choice,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I really would rather not to tell him, but I think he can be trusted. Besides, having the principal of the school on our side would be very useful,&#39; the former boy naively thinks to himself. The “girl” bows her head in defeat, “fine, I&#39;ll tell you everything,” he says and start to explain the device and what has happened the day before to Mr. Powers.<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers listens closely, once Max has finished explaining the device to him, being amazed would be an understatement. “So, you are telling me that you and your... brother have transformed each other into girls,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“That is correct, sir,” Max says.<br />
<br />
The principal looks at the device in his hands, “and this thing is able to not only change people&#39;s genders, but also transform objects into people and vice versa,” he asks, Max nods. Mr. Powers looks at the girl hard, “you seem to be telling the truth,” he says, “but... I am not fully convinced.”<br />
<br />
Max looks at Mr. Powers, “you want to see something with your own eyes,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers nods, “that way I know that you are not bullshitting me,” he says.<br />
<br />
Max thinks for a while, &#39;what could I show him without having it backfire on me,&#39; he thinks to himself, then an idea pops into his mind. The “girl” looks up at the principal, “sir, what hair colour do you find attractive on women?”<br />
<br />
“Black,” Mr. Powers says.<br />
<br />
“Then open my stats and change my hair colour to black,” Max says, &#39;this should convince him,&#39; he thinks.<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers finds Max&#39;s stats and opens them:<br />
<br />
Name: Max Evans<br />
Age: 14<br />
Gender: female<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;3 (161cm)<br />
Bra-size: b-cup<br />
Hair style: brown shoulder length<br />
Libido: low<br />
Sexual Orientation: lesbian<br />
Relationship status: single not interested<br />
Awareness: on<br />
Knowledge of the Chronivac: yes<br />
<br />
“Holly cow,” the principal says, “this thing really knows EVERYTHING about someone.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Max says, “in order to change my hair colour, you simply erase the name of the colour that is in the box labelled “hairstyle”, and change it to “black”. You are also able to change the length and appearance of the hairstyle.”<br />
<br />
&#39;Hmmm... if this really works, then this device should not be in the hands of a child,&#39; the principal thinks to himself, &#39;it would be better to keep it for myself, besides, I have more reasonable use for it.&#39; Mr. Powers changes the colour of Max&#39;s hair from brown to black and watches with wide eyes as the “girl&#39;s” hair changes colour. “It really works,” he says amazed, “now I AM convinced.”<br />
<br />
Max smiles, “glad to hear that,” he says, “c-could you please give my hair it&#39;s natural colour back and could I now please have my device back?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Mr. Powers says, he then starts to type, what Max is unaware of is that Mr. Powers is editing his stats to suit his plans better. The following is Max&#39;s new stats:<br />
<br />
Name: Maxine Evans<br />
Age: 14<br />
Gender: female<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;3 (161cm)<br />
Bra-size: b-cup<br />
Hairstyle: brown shoulder length<br />
Libido: average<br />
Sexual Orientation: straight<br />
Relationship status: single and searching<br />
Awareness: off<br />
Knowledge of the Chronivac: no<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers looks over the “girl&#39;s” new stats, &#39;that should do it for now,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I might change a few things once I get more used to this device,&#39; with that he saves the edits.<br />
<br />
Max suddenly feels light headed and dizzy, he staggers a little and clutches his head, “w-woah... why do I fee-feel so dizzy all of a sudden,” he asks himself.<br />
<br />
“Are you feeling alright, miss Evans,” Mr. Powers asks, hiding the Chronivac behind his back.<br />
<br />
“I... I don&#39;t know,” the “girl” says, “it feels as if I forgot something important.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers grins inwardly, “do you remember why you came to my office?”<br />
<br />
Max tries to remember, he knew there was a very important reason for him to come to the principal&#39;s office, but he seems unable to figure out what that important thing was. “I... I can&#39;t remember,” he says, sounding confused.<br />
<br />
“You should head to the hospital ward,” Mr. Powers says, “sounds like a heat stroke to me.”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah... I better get myself ch-checked,” Max says, “I feel really str-strange.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Powers nods, “then you should get going,” he says, “I&#39;ll let your teacher know,” he adds.<br />
<br />
“Th-thanks sir,” the “girl” says, “s-sorry for wasting your t-time,” she adds as she heads to the door.<br />
<br />
“No problem, miss Evans,” the man says, “if you should remember the reason you came to me, you may come back later.”<br />
<br />
“Maxine” nods and exits the office, closing the door behind her. Once the “girl” had disappeared, Mr. Powers takes the device from behind his back, smirking evilly as ideas and thoughts on what to do with the device, he could use it on the pupils, he could use it on himself and since he is a desperate single he could use it to create the woman of his dreams. The man licks his lips as he stares at the Chronivac in his hands, his penis twitches as he pictures all the possibilities he could achieve with the device. “What should I try to do first,” he asks himself, “should I change another student? Should I create my dream woman? Should I use it on myself? It would be nice to be young again. Decisions, decisions.”</p>
