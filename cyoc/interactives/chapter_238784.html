<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All of the events of the day, and the days before, must have finally caught up to the pair, because the moment the two fell asleep, they were out like a light. <br />
<br />
Soon enough, the only sounds to be heard in the room were Miles’s light breaths and James’s deep snores as Miles comfortably nestled into James’s hairy and sturdy chest. James, meanwhile, had wrapped a beefy arm around Miles’s back, keeping the smaller man secure and close to him as the twink used him as a makeshift bed. <br />
<br />
Although it may not have been what they had envisioned when they chose to go out this morning, there were no complaints to be made by either member of the couple, their intimate cuddling only ending the perfect day on an even higher note.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Luke O’Deorain stepped off the subway and sipped some coffee from his steel tumbler before he began making his way to the closest set of stairs. As he started his descent up the stairs, Luke couldn’t help but begin to become excited at the idea of seeing his brother again.<br />
<br />
It was Labor Day, so Luke knew James would have the day off and, despite a part of him internally protesting against showing up unannounced, Luke really wanted to surprise his brother. <br />
<br />
Being 18, Luke shared a 4 year age gap with his older brother, meaning the two hadn’t always had much time to see one another growing up. This became even more apparent when James began university and moved to a dorm on campus. <br />
<br />
Now that James was working a full-time job and Luke was the one in college, their time to meet felt even more limited. Luckily for them, Luke’s school was close to James’s apartment, allowing them to easily visit one another when time permitted. Like today, for instance.<br />
<br />
Luke made his way to the bus stop and sat on an empty bench, courtesy only granted from it being a federal holiday, and checked his phone. It was 5 in the morning. Some might say it was way too early to visit, but Luke wanted to make the most of the day with James so he didn’t mind having to wake up extra early. He only hoped James would share his sentiments.<br />
<br />
Once the bus arrived, Luke took it until it dropped him off near James’s apartment complex and made his way into the lobby. Upon entering, Luke felt a sudden urge to take a piss and quickly sauntered over to the men’s bathroom and relieved himself before washing his hands. As he reached for a paper towel, Luke couldn’t help but catch his reflection. <br />
<br />
Luke looked similar to his brother yet there were some stark differences. For instance, Luke was actually a few inches taller than James. The only explanation for this could be from the constant exercise Luke did. As a member of the swim team all throughout middle school and high school, Luke had made sure to keep his body in shape which made way to the next big difference between the brothers: their builds. <br />
<br />
While James was slender and lean, Luke had much more muscle definition on his body, giving him a more brawny physique with a firm set of pectorals and a defined six-pack. His arms and legs were also more muscular and thicker, the results from his workouts and swimming.<br />
<br />
The final difference between the brother’s appearances was their hair. Compared to James’s messy and voluminous hair, Luke’s was straight, short and trimmed. Due to swim, Luke had always rocked short hair, and in spite of not joining the university’s swim team, he had gotten rather used to cutting his hair short and chose to keep the same hairstyle.<br />
<br />
But other than that, the two brothers looked incredibly alike. Luke sported the same bright orange hair and emerald green eyes James had as well as his own set of freckles on his face. Due to his taller stature, Luke had grown into his ears, unlike his brother, but still maintained a sort of “cute” look to him.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to him, Luke shared one more similarity with his brother’s appearance: a perfect bubble butt. Perhaps it ran in the family, but Luke had a nice and plump ass that had only further been developed from his squats and exercising. And while Luke didn’t pay much attention to his firm and hardy butt, it definitely caught the attention of many men and women.<br />
<br />
Luke dried his hands and exited the bathroom, taking the elevator up to James’s floor. Reaching his brother’s apartment door, Luke lightly knocked in consideration for James’s neighbors. After waiting a minute with no response, Luke could only assume his brother was still fast asleep. <br />
<br />
Jiggling the doorknob, Luke was surprised to find that the door was unlocked. “I can’t believe he was so careless,” Luke thought to himself, slightly annoyed before realizing the opportunity his brother had presented him. <br />
<br />
He COULD just go inside. He knew his brother wouldn’t mind and it would definitely help him from making too much noise outside.</p>
