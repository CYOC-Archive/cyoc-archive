<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah’s car was in the drive when I arrived back at the house, but the door was locked and Biddy was absent. I guessed they had gone for a walk. I went in and made myself a cup of tea while I waited for them to return. <br />
<br />
I rang Zach and invited him and Amanda around for a BBQ lunch on Sunday letting him know that Hilda would be there. He thanked me, said they would be come about mid-day. We had a general discussion about how things were going. He had no regrets about our body-swap and when I mentioned the medallion said he would be happy if he never saw it again. <br />
<br />
Sarah and Biddy returned. She gave me a big kiss “I managed to get to Target at lunchtime and made some new purchases. Do you want to see?” <br />
<br />
She took me into the guest bedroom where there were three ‘Target’ shopping bags on the bed. She tipped one out. Three bra’s were now on the bed. “I bought a bra in my size but with D cups” She picked up a black lacy bra. “Are you expecting anyone tonight?” I shook my head. “Ok I’m going to see what this does. Do you want to watch?”<br />
<br />
“Of course”<br />
<br />
She took the new bra with her to the master bedroom. There she stripped off her blouse and bra and fetched the medallion from its cupboard putting the chain around her next so that the actual medallion settled under her breasts. I watched as she picked up the black bra and touched it to the medallion “I felt a tingle” she said smiling at me. <br />
<br />
We both walked to the bathroom to be able to watch the changes in the larger mirror as was now becoming our habit. Once in there she placed the medallion on the bench and turned to look in the mirror. It didn’t see anything happening at all. But Sarah said “They are getting bigger, I can feel they are heavier” I looked carefully and her breasts were clearly slightly larger. Nothing else about her had changed, she still had her own narrow waist. She put the black bra on and we continued to watch as the cups slowly filled. <br />
<br />
Eventually the bra was fitting her perfectly, I judged the changes were complete. “Would you mind?” I asked. <br />
<br />
“Go ahead” she replied. I gently felt her new breasts, cupping them in my hands. <br />
<br />
“Very nice”<br />
<br />
“Ok your turn now” She told me. “Strip off and put the medallion on” I wondered what might be in the other bags, could she have found a jock strap or something else that might enlarge my penis? I was quite excited about taking this new bigger breasted version of Sarah to bed. <br />
<br />
I did as I was told. She went to the other room, returned and she came through the door said: ”Close your eyes” I did and shortly afterward felt a shock as she touched the clothing to the medallion on my chest. “You can look now” I opened my eyes to see Sarah smiling at me and holding a pair of white lacy knickers and a band such that girls use to tie their hair in a ponytail. Here I go again I thought, as I realized I was in for another night of femininity.<br />
<br />
“I want to see if my theory works” she said in way of an apology. <br />
<br />
Nothing I could do now but see what happens. I removed the medallion and put it back in the cupboard. I discarded my undies and returned naked to the bathroom. Sarah stroked my erect penis “Poor boy, you will just have to wait. We are having a girls night tonight” I could feel it shrinking but it stayed erect. This time my hair grew down past my shoulders and it was still growing as my face morphed into Rhonda’s. My hips changed to be a perfect fit for the white lacy undies. This time I was a skinnier version of Rhonda. My breasts were sprouting but stopped short of becoming the monsters I had last night. My hair was by now down to my waist but the growth had almost stopped. Sarah could no longer find anything to hold in my crotch.<br />
<br />
“The undies are my size so if my theory is correct you should be able to wear any of my clothes” Sarah and I were of similar heights and appeared to be of very similar build. Her breasts were larger. “Well put your new knickers on and let’s see if I have a bra that fits” <br />
<br />
Shortly I joined her in the master bedroom. Sarah had selected a white bra and helped me put it on. “Not a perfect fit but close enough” She looked through wardrobe “Let’s go to the other room and select a nice dress”<br />
<br />
Once in the guest bedroom she searched through the wardrobe there and handed me a dress. It was the same dress I had worn last week when I was in Sarah’s body and Rod had seduced me, or had I seduced Rod? Anyway she said “Put this on and then we had better get something to eat” She selected another dress for herself and went back to the other room to change.<br />
<br />
I zipped up the dress which fitted nicely and looked in the mirror. I still had Rod’s hazel eyes and was unmistakably Rhonda from last night. However I now had a slim attractive body and long dark brown hair down to my waist. It looked very attractive in the dress I was wearing. My skin was still porcelain white and flawless. I held my hair back as if to put it in a ponytail and began to make faces in the mirror. I look a bit severe I thought. I smiled. My teeth were as flawless as my skin. I certainly looked better when I smiled.<br />
<br />
“Uh hmm” I turned around, Sarah was at the door watching me. She was her usual stunning self, wearing a thigh length colorful dress topped with a feminine black jacket. “Let’s see what I can do about that hair. I have a bit more to work with than last night. She bade me to sit on a kitchen chair and began to brush my hair. “I won’t try to do too much, maybe just trim the ends” She cut of the end of the hair but that still left it reaching down to the small of my back. “It would be a shame to tie that up. I’ll get a hair band” She went to the guest room and returned with a hair band, much the same color as the dress I was wearing. She positioned it on my head and seemed satisfied with the result. It left all the hair at the back, no longer obscuring my face<br />
<br />
“Now for some make-up. No need to go to great lengths, but a bit of color is needed on those cheeks”. She dabbed some rouge on my cheeks then applied some red lipstick. “I think we are ready. Let’s get some shoes on then go out for dinner, my treat”<br />
<br />
She gave me no opportunity to argue as she searched through her shoes and handed me a pair to try on. They fit well. “Perfect, your feet are my size”<br />
<br />
She went back to the shoe box and produced another pair this time some black sandals with 2 inch heels. “These will go better with that dress” She selected another pair for herself and put them on. “Time to grab our bags and go” She went back to the master bedroom and came out with two handbags, giving one to me. <br />
………..<br />
Sarah drove us into town and took me to a café in the mall in the center of town. It was a warm night, so she selected an outdoor table where we could watch people walking past. We ordered a glass of white each and some dips as starters. For a main meal I choose Atlantic Salmon while Sarah ordered a quiche. It was a very pleasant setting and I enjoyed the sensation of a light breeze blowing on my legs and ruffling my dress. Sarah, as you may have guessed, enjoyed fashion and was telling me what colors and styles would suit my current complexion. <br />
<br />
The dips and drinks arrived and I was enjoying the ambience. Suddenly from a nearby table a female voice said “Sarah, Sarah McKenzie?” we both looked around. At a nearby table was a larger sized girl of about our age. Sarah recognized her and so did I. It was Madeline Smith the school genius. Last I had heard she had gone to Melbourne and was studying medicine. That was years ago when we first left school. I had heard nothing of her since. I didn’t know she and Sarah knew each other. <br />
<br />
“Hello Madeline” Sarah replied. “I didn’t know you were back in town” <br />
<br />
“I’m only here for the weekend up to see my parents. Just catching up with some old school friends tonight. What about yourself? Are you still living in town? Might I join you while I wait for my friends?” Unbidden she moved across and sat down at our table. I was starting to get a bit worried as Madeline was the same school year as me. Her school friends were probably from my class as well. I was trying to think of who she used to hang around with. Would any of them somehow recognize me? <br />
<br />
Sarah said “Madeline this is my friend Rhonda who is visiting from Adelaide”<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you Rhonda”<br />
<br />
“Likewise Madeline, Did you go to school with Sarah”<br />
<br />
Not in the same class. We did dancing together for many years. Believe it or not I used to be quite petite”<br />
<br />
I sipped my wine while Sarah and Madeline caught up about each other’s lives. 10 minutes later 3 girls came across and pulled an adjacent table across next to ours. Madeline got up and hugged them all. They were 3 girls from school, I knew them very well, one in particular, my ex-girlfriend from year 12, Claudia Johnson.<br />
<br />
Madeline introduced them all to me: &quot;Rhonda this Grace, Linda and Claudia they were all classmates from high school. Girls this is Rhonda a friend of Sarah&#39;s from Adelaide&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you all&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have wonderful long hair&quot; said Linda. &quot;It must be so hard to maintain&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I&#39;m used to it&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Rhonda was saying she wouldn&#39;t mind trying a shorter style&quot; chipped in Sarah. The next 10 minutes was discussions about the pro&#39;s and cons of different hairstyles. The topic only changed when Claudia mentioned to Madeline that Sarah was engaged to their old class mate Rod Burton. Sarah had to flash her engagement ring to them all. <br />
<br />
Our meals arrived and Sarah and myself listened to the conversation around us as we ate. The consensus was that Rod was a hunk and Sarah had done well. <br />
<br />
Claudia said &quot;I used to know Rod very well as at one stage I used to go out with his best mate Zach&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now he was a hunk&quot; said Linda<br />
<br />
&quot;With a capitol H&quot; said Madeline<br />
<br />
&quot;Breaking up with Zach was probably the biggest regret of my life&quot; said Claudia. (You were the one who wanted to expand your horizons, I thought silently) &quot;I thought the grass was greener elsewhere. Big mistake. He always lacked ambition but he was a really nice guy&quot; <br />
<br />
Sarah caught my eye and grinned &quot;Did you know Zach got engaged last weekend? To Amanda Jones&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a pity&quot; said Claudia. <br />
<br />
Meals for the other girls arrived and the conversation turned to fashion. Sarah said she was planning to take me (aka Rhonda) shopping for outfits tomorrow morning. Evidently I had a wedding coming up in Adelaide and wanted to check out some of the boutiques here in town.<br />
<br />
I glared at Sarah. I wasn&#39;t intending to be in this body tomorrow morning.<br />
<br />
After they finished their meals. The other girls said they were heading off to one of the bars in town. They invited Sarah and myself to join them. This time I got in before Sarah and said I was feeling tired after travelling and didn&#39;t want to have a late night.<br />
Sarah agreed with me &quot;We have a big day shopping ahead of us tomorrow&quot; <br />
<br />
We said goodbye to everyone, paid our bill and left. Once we were in the car I said to Sarah &quot;What&#39;s this about shopping tomorrow&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You will love it. Look at as another experience you would never have expected to have&quot;<br />
<br />
I was quiet on the way home. I had the feeling that things were getting out of my control. But at the same time It would be a unique experience. Why not go along while I had the chance?<br />
<br />
Sarah put the kettle on once we were back home. We each had a cup of tea. When we had finished Sarah invited me to have a cuddle with her in bed. I did but I must have been tired as cuddle was all that we did</p>
