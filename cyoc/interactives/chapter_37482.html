<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the end, it all works out for you. Attending school dressed as a girl, nobody can tell that you're really a boy. The teachers for some reason address you as Kim or when you've been caught doing something you are not supposed to, then it's 'Ms. Patterson'.<br />
<br />
Seeing as people will perceive in the same manner as the way you dress, after school you head down to the local charity store and after filling out a form that asks you your name and household income, answering a few verbal questions, you walk away with a full wardrobe of clothes suitable for a seventeen year old girl.<br />
<br />
During school days, you head out wearing the clothes you got from the local charity place. On weekends, you simply borrow your sister's; for some reason they feel more comfortable then the ones meant for an older girl.<br />
<br />
So with knowledge in mind, you come up with a plan. The idea is that you dress as a girl and hopefully you can figure out how to reverse what is happening to you and at the same time suffer no more moments when your mind goes completely hazy and you find yourself doing something you'd normally not do.<br />
<br />
It all works out as weeks turn to months and before you know it, summer is here and you're free for three whole months before you have to start your sophomore year at high school. But there in lies the problem; you’re not sure, but you think that you are still changing.<br />
<br />
As the days go by, your room looks more and more like a little girl’s room. A full body mirror sits in the corner; one you feel would be perfect for dressing up in front of. Your desk has been replaced by a vanity that matches your dresser, white with the same pink knobs, and holds all sorts of trinkets that sometimes you just love to play with.<br />
<br />
In one drawer are Angelina Ballerina's doll clothes, something you place with once and a while. In another is some make-up; for pretending to do your face up like mommy's. The center flip-up part holds your hair pieces, earrings and other costume jewelry.<br />
<br />
And that’s the other thing, your hair. It is now completely black, but running down the center of it is two white stripes, which makes you think you look like Miss. P.U.<br />
<br />
Looking at your room, the costumes, nightgowns, dresses and skirts that now hang in your closet, and then looking at the mirror and seeing your fifteen year old reflection, you can't help but think to yourself, &quot;Something has changed. But what, I can't remember. I think that I look different and my room has changed as well; but how?&quot;<br />
<br />
You have no answer to this as you look at your now skinny, feminine frame. You stand about five foot three now and weigh close to a hundred and thirteen pounds. Your hazel eyes have turned a dark shade of brown, which you find it difficult to remember the old colouring of your eyes.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door distracts you from your musing and you hear your mom asking, &quot;Sweetie, do you want to go swimming with me and your sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is something you've been trying to avoid, even in school; changing in the woman's locker room. When it came time to dress for gym, you usually told the teacher that you'd rather get an F than undress in front of a bunch of people. The teacher said you could dress in one of the stalls. This only became a problem when gym class was held in the pool and in the end you refused to cooperate.<br />
<br />
Standing there, wondering how to best answer your mother's question, you feel like your mind is being wrapped in fog once again, something that hasn't happened since at least November of last year.<br />
<br />
Next you hear yourself telling your mother, &quot;I would love to, but I don't have anything to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back into the mirror, you see your reflection, currently dressed in a pair of your sister's shorts and a white t-shirt that reads, 'Ballet time is fun time'. You then hear your mom saying, &quot;That's okay princess. We can stop and pick something for you on the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling, you skip out your room, and toward the front door of the apartment. There you pull on a pair of pink and white sandals and taking your mother's offered hand, you, your mom and Steph leave the apartment for the local pool. On the way there, the three of you stop and purchase for you a bathing suit.<br />
<br />
It is a one piece for a two year old girl. The front is white with blue colouring scattered here and there, giving it the appearance of a cloudy filled sky. The back of it is all blue, with only a mesh piece on the sides connecting the front and the back.<br />
<br />
Next stop is the pool. Your mother leads the two of you into the ladies changing room and opening a locker, puts the towels inside. Next she pulls off her dress to reveal that she has her bathing suit on underneath. As she deposits it into the locker, she tells you and your sister, &quot;Put your stuff in here when you’re done changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing you sister pulling off her shorts, shirt and underwear, you follow suit, not giving a thought to the fact that your penis and testicles are exposed the whole room. And had you been paying attention, you’d see that nobody’s saying anything. The most anyone said was, &quot;Aren't they cute?&quot; as Steph pulled on a rainbow coloured bikini and you sat down on the floor and began pulling on the swim suit mother had bought you.<br />
<br />
Genitalia tucked back, the bathing suit makes you look like a really pretty girl as it gave the right accents in the right areas. Throwing your clothes into the locker, you and your sister take off for the pool giggling and screaming with pleasure.<br />
<br />
The next three hours are spent playing with Steph and a couple of other girls, whom you introduce yourself as Kim. When mother comes to find you and your sister, Steph and you beg to play for just a bit longer, but your mother is adamant in her decision that it is time to go. Waving goodbye to your new friends, you follow your sister into the locker room.<br />
<br />
It's only when you strip naked and go chasing after your sister that your mind reasserts itself. As the two of you wash off in the showers, you notice something is different. Not sure what it is, you finish washing off and begin heading back to the locker.<br />
<br />
It's when you are getting dressed that you figure out what's undergone a change. Holding your underwear, you notice that you penis and testicles are gone. In there place is a smooth and hairless crotch. As you sit down on the bench, noticing how it feels pressed up against you new genitalia, you see the smallest trace of a fold that signals were all your exterior plumbing has been moved to.<br />
<br />
It's really bothersome when you pull up the underwear, because of how much you like having them pressed against your vulva. Asking yourself, &quot;How much weirder can this get?&quot; you finish getting your clothes as your mom offers you and Steph dinner at the local burger restaurant.</p>
