<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everything was black and dark...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Your mind hurt to a degree...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Then the void steadily retracted from your conscious cloud...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Your head was whoozy, memories blurry, steadily coming back as your mind regained conscious feeling...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
You groggily open your eye, you remembered the chamber, the serum, the greys... But the bio-tank saw different... Wait, didn&#39;t the helmet prevent you from seeing?<br />
<br />
Has the surroundings changed? How long has passed since that serum entered your body?<br />
<br />
How long has your body changed-...<br />
<br />
Changed?<br />
<br />
You felt different...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t quite set your finger on the right feeling...<br />
<br />
You were oblivious to the correct feeling of change...<br />
<br />
For now you focused on what you could see that had changed.<br />
 <br />
Your helmet was the most obvious thing as you couldn&#39;t remember being able to see in it when it was put on you, it also occured to you that  your helmet seemed to be almost translucent, as though you were looking through a screen but it wasn&#39;t composed of lights, almost like a one way window.<br />
The Bio-tanks interior had changed too, it was lit by several rings of neon green circulating the cylindrical chamber.<br />
It was obvious you weren&#39;t in the same place, or did the place just change? Improved? possibly...<br />
<br />
&#39;Where am I?&#39; You asked yourself... Wait. You felt as though you said it to something? You felt as though you commanded something your question. Commanded them to answer your question... Then you felt something... Activating? No. Awakening.<br />
<br />
Then you saw your helmets visor flicker, then darken as neon green dots light up and you feel an urge to close your eyes and prepare for soemthing as you felt something in the back of your skull tingle. Having only newly woken up and still quite drowsy, you close your eyes, then you feel as though something connects wit hyour brain and you feel yourself tugged backwards as a wave of nausuea wreaks over your body as many new feelings enter your body, your body going limp as though your nerves were disconnected or had entered autopilot of sorts.<br />
<br />
You feel your consciousness drift into water, entering an abyssmal landscape.<br />
<br />
Then you (or your consciousness rather as you were essentially bodiless) saw a neon green shape take form, a solar system started to form some distance away, then thousands of other star systems holographically appeared.<br />
<br />
The shape closest to your subconscious body started to take a wider form as it began to appear as some sort of massive ship, then thousands of large points around it swelled, gaining rough asymmetrical but closely spherical shapes, reminiscent of asteroids. The ship in the middle of this asteroid field appeared massive and sleek, somewhat spiky but the &#39;spikes&#39; were all quite small and only covered a few areas of the massive ship, maybe some kind of weapons battery? You weren&#39;t familiar with spaceship designs but you were pretty sure the spaceship infront of you was the one you were inside, it looked alien... Big sleek and dark coloured, oh yeah, colour came to your vision of the ship, it was a largely black ship, with neon green lines and dark grey sections.<br />
<br />
Then somehow, you knew how big the ship really was, like the information was just ready for you. The ship was in total, 14&#39;568 kilometres long. You were aboard a planetship huh. &#39;Wait, what about earth?&#39; You thought, You looked over at the nearest solar system, it was 1 lightyear away from the ship, instantaniously you move your focus over to it. Your subconscious mind recognises it as Sol, the solar system that mother earth inhabitet. Or Terra?<br />
<br />
The solar system looked odd, Firstly, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter was mostly gone, as if mined almost completely barren, Mercury was completely gone, strip mined then detonated, Mars was covered in radiation from nuclear bombs and pion decay, massive craters littered it&#39;s surface, it seemed to have gotten an atmosphere oddly enough, not that said atmosphere was particularly useful not that the planet was engulfed in nuclear winter.<br />
<br />
 Then you noticed Earth. Or what was left of Earth... A large asteroid field had made it&#39;s home in the exact position of where Earth should have been. The planetary shards being massive asteroids dozens of kilometres in average, some where almost a hundred kilometres in average diameter. You felt a tint of despair, you noticed spaceships flocking about in Sol, space stations in orbit of Jupiter and saturn, sucking out gasses through manipulation of electromagnetic fields. &#39;Are those ships human?&#39; You asked, a wave went over the thousands of ships, scanning them and their crew, oddly enough there was no ship there that had lifesigns reminiscent of humans, well some ships had a human or two aboard, but they all were noticably different. The ships they were aboard were also different from the other more numerical ships in the system. Noticeably, they had, more weapons than the other more common ships, although most of them could be cargo ships you were uncertain.<br />
<br />
Most of them looked industrial, atleast from the neon green outlining of the ships. All the ships had one large energy signature originating from the starships rear, an energy reactor perhaps? And maybe some sort of FTL drive? You queried yourself as you looked closer at the ships with humans aboard. You then looked over at the fragmented Earth. Yo uwanted to know what had happened to your home. So you asked the ship. &#39;&#39;What has happened while i was asleep?&#39;&#39; You noticed the mostly black landscape of this 3d map you were in shaking, then every system except for Sol were shrouded in darkness, leaving only sol, then Sol stopped it&#39;s movements, the ships, the asteroids, everything stopped, as if time itself stopped, but this was merely a simulation, a map, you reassured yourself as the ships dissapeared, then the entire soløar system fizzed before it reverted to a more whole state, Mercury was there, Mars was still it&#39;s barren self, the asteroid belt seperating the soalr system in two dissapeared and Earth was whole again.<br />
<br />
Then time seemed to resume and you watched intently as the planet slowly spun, the ISS doing it&#39;s normal business. You noticed soemthing  reminiscent of a oblong saucer located in orbit, cloaked to the planet surface, you deemed it was most likely the ship of the grey&#39;s that set you into this situation. Yo uwatched it intently as it drifted out of the planets orbit before gaining speed and then jetting off faster than light out of the system, past the asteroid belts and into the vast galactic stage. You looked back at the Earth. And waited.<br />
<br />
You were intent on finding out what had happened, and why Earth was currently shattered into fragments.<br />
<br />
You waited...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
And waited...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Hm, wait, was it currently in realtime? If it is and you were asleep for over a year the nthis would take foreeeeeeeeeveeeeeer.<br />
<br />
You huffed, then Earth suddenly began speeding up, spinning faster and faster together wit hall the other planets. Time was speeding up, You were in control.<br />
<br />
You watched everything unfold, speeding through uneventful parts, speeding through humanity&#39;s eventful expansion into their solar system, well it wasn&#39;t so eventful for you as you watched intently. Then after several minutes of watching, you noticed something entering Sol, it wasn&#39;t soemthing human that was for sure. As it was well over several hundred ships, each 1 kilometre to 10 kilometres in size, Humanity didn&#39;t have an exceptional military, their only military spaceships were around 600 meters in length, with weak energy weaponry.<br />
<br />
The alien floatilla seemed to float unhindered towards pluto, where humanity had made a small colony. After several seconds to you but what might have been a couple week in the simulation, the alien floatilla left the system. Around several weeks later Humanity&#39;s first spaceship equipped with an FTL drive gifted to them by the alien fleet made a test between the Earth and Mars was successful, but himanity didn&#39;t have the correct materials to manufacture more FTL drives nor FTL capable spacecraft, so their only FTL capable starship proceeded to the neighboring Aliens, apparently it didn&#39;t go so very well, and the aliens humanity had contacted were not the ones who first visited them.<br />
<br />
Some small conflict ensue where humanity gets their asses kicked out of Sol, luckily, some of the other alien races went to help humanity remain, but the attackers were just too much and humanities home was destroyed and much of humanity was obliterated, exterminated. But a small fraction of their population was saved by the friendly aliens.<br />
<br />
Decades later, the aliens who reduced humanity into a shadow of their former selves seems to have settled in a fourth of the galaxy&#39;s space, by far the largest empire in the milky way. Then there was current day.<br />
<br />
What was odd to you was that the grey&#39;s who had done this to you had seemingly dissapeared from the galaxy somehow, they didn&#39;t help humanity when it was under siege. Nor were they in any other piece of the galaxy.<br />
<br />
You made the 3d map of the galaxy dissapear, and you sat in silence, contemplating over what you had saw in a span of aroudn half an hour.<br />
<br />
Yo uthen asked soemthing. &#39;How long was a away?&#39; &#39;1&#39;540 Years.&#39; Came your answer. You release an ethereal sigh. You then look at the ship you were in. You commanded for signatures across the ship.<br />
<br />
Your command was accepted as a large list appeared in front of you. One human was aboard, or according to the list, one Adjudicator, your mind told you it was you. You were a human, but a changed one. The list also said there were a total of 34 billion &#39;Huran&#39;s&#39;, all in a cryosleep, you noted that you were unable to issue an order to wake some of them. It ocudl be that they went into hiding, which might be why they so suddenly dissapeared fro mthe galactic theatre.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
You wanted fresh air. You wanted to feel your body again. And you ordered it. And the ship complied, as you felt yoru subconscious etherealness get dragged away into physicality, into your own body as your nerves reactivated and you opened your eyes to the abyssal insides of the helmet you were wearing. You felt naseaus as you twitched your fingers, before compelte control over your body came forth. Then you felt as if you were puking, the tubes which had suplied you with air directly along with nutrients started removing itself from your lungs and stomach the nas they left, you began coughing madly as the fluid that filled the bio-tank rapidly drained as the variety of other tubes disconnected from your suit, your helmet being taken off as you collapse to the clean grey floor. lightly spasming as you wildly coughed.<br />
<br />
Then you rapidly healed from this endeavour, the coughing stopping as the spasms stopped and you lifted yourself from the bio-tanks floor  lightly coughing as a naseaus feling wreaks over your body, you hear several clicks reach your ears as the bio-tanks walls raise, revealing the room in which the tank was located.<br />
<br />
The room was cylindrical with grey walls, neon grey lines illuminated the room in white light despite it&#39;s neon colour. you were standing on a raised platform in the middle of the room, numerous grey slopes gave way to the chamber floor. four large doorways followed out into large corridors. You looked groggily around, your face and suit finally exposed to fresh air, might not be as fresh as on Earth but it was atleast something, better than nothing, alteast better than suffocating among the fragmented planetary shards of Earth anyway...<br />
<br />
You go to walk to one of the grey slopes, but after a couple steps you notice a heavy weight hanging from your chest. Looking down you see, boobs. massive boobs. like twice the size of a watermelon boobs, you were in shock, then you looked at your musculature, It was kind of hard t osee from the fact you were wearing a suit, you also noticed your suit had changed but it didn&#39;t bother you for now, COnfirming your belief, your bod yhad a more feminine look, slender arms, dainty hands, dainty feet and slender legs, You believed you might also be taller than you were before this change. You look at your ass, it was mildly plump but for a woman with such large boobs as you, your ass was quite puny in plumpness. You reach to your crotch and notice you didn&#39;t have a dick, replaced by a female vagina. &#39;&#39;H-huh!?&#39;&#39; You exclaim, your surprised by your female voice, but the fact you were a female now did make it wierd if you had a males voice.<br />
<br />
You want to look for a mirror but digress. Then a mirror materializes itself besides you, a mirror of hardlight? You scan over your body, your hair was a black colour, thin streaks of neon green was scattered across it, Your face was that of a cute woman staring in bewilderment, you also noticed the neon green lines that creeped from past your cheeks engraved in your skin. You were bewildered at this. Your boobs were massive... </p>
