<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clutching the stone tightly as if he expected it to wriggle out of his grip in search of a new owner, Jeff returned to his room.<br />
He decided that he would have to find a better hiding place for it, as it would seem that Emily couldn&#39;t keep her hands to herself. Scanning the room for creative hiding spots, he eventually settled on the top of the window frame, behind the curtain. That way, even if Emily happened to spot it, she probably wouldn&#39;t be able to reach that high. And besides, Jeff usually kept that curtain closed.<br />
<br />
Even though it had only been a few hours, Jeff was eager to check for replies on that weird blog he had found.<br />
Unfortunately there was nothing new. It seemed that the site had a rather small user base, and sometimes it went entire days without new comments.<br />
<br />
Sighing in frustration, Jeff closed the tab and decided to deal with his newest problem. He really needed to pee.<br />
It wasn&#39;t the first time he had needed to urinate with his newly configured genitalia, but it was still an unpleasant experience for him and he had taken to holding it in for as long as he could.<br />
<br />
Shuffling into the bathroom and remembering that he had to sit now, Jeff pulled down his pants and boxers and let it go.<br />
He wanted to look up and away so that he didn&#39;t have to confront the reality between his legs, but he was also worried that he might make some kind of mess if he didn&#39;t pay attention. The unfamiliar slit between his thighs was looking a lot less swollen than before, and even though his mind was still reeling at the sight of it and the pee streaming almost directly downwards from his relocated urethra, a wave of relief washed over him. Releasing the pressure on his bladder through his new anatomy was still an upsettingly pleasurable feeling.<br />
<br />
As he finished up his business, he once again noticed the post-it note reminding him to wipe.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he tore off a square of paper and roughly pawed at his vagina, getting the job done as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
As he pulled up his pants and boxers and washed his hands, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but acknowledge the baggy pocket of nothing in the front of his boxers, and how they no longer fit as well. With Emily out of the house, perhaps he could try on the feminine underwear without her barging in and embarrassing him.<br />
<br />
Back in his room, he undressed his lower half and stepped out of his pants and boxers. Emptying the bag of underwear onto his bed, Jeff selected the plainest pair of boyshort panties he could find, stepping into them and sliding them up his legs until they snugly fit around his butt and pussy. While the underwear was a much better fit for his new lower body, he immediately hated the sensation of the garment hugging every part of his crotch.<br />
Quickly tearing off the boyshorts off and casting them aside, Jeff&#39;s eyes were drawn to one of the the lacy thongs Emily had purchased for him. A thin purple thing that was mostly transparent in the front. Perhaps less coverage would be more comfortable? Besides, he couldn&#39;t deny that some part of him was curious about how it might feel.<br />
<br />
Inspecting the delicate garment for a while and fighting back feelings of disgust, Jeff bit his lip and decided to give it a shot.<br />
As he slowly pulled the thing into place and his cheeks burned red with shame, Jeff was startled by the sound of his door suddenly opening.<br />
He turned to see his own mother, who looked quite shocked to see her only son squeezing himself into a such a revealing garment.<br />
<br />
She quickly averted her eyes, acting as if she had seen nothing and Jeff frantically grabbed his pants, holding them in front of his lower body to protect what remained of his modesty.<br />
&quot;M-Mom! Knock before you come in!&quot; he stammered.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry dear. It just that your father and I wanted to know how you felt about returning to school. We&#39;re all very supportive of your big... decision, but we can&#39;t let your grades drop because of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
This hit Jeff like a ton of bricks. He hadn&#39;t even thought of returning to school in his new condition. Would everyone know why he was absent?<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re still not feeling up to it,&quot; she continued, &quot;We could have one of your school friends drop by with your homework. It&#39;s up to you, sweetie.&quot;</p>
