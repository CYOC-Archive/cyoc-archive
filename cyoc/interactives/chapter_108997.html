<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson were busy being congratulated by the various pride members on joining them and politely turning down requests for a more intimate meeting; A lone were-panthress was silently observing the two as Frieda Knight left them to grab some of the rare roast beef that Franklin Catering prepared. With most distracted as they all observed John Shaffer, the seven foot werewolf effortlessly carve the many roasts; letting the smell of the bloody beef enhance the arousal of the hungry weres; the were-panthress slowly makes her way to the two new inductees.<br />
<br />
Being a black furred were-panthress with yellow feline like eyes; the six and a half foot were saunters up to the two as they idly chat with a few lingering guests as they have yet to head to the buffet. Grinning, the were-panthress approaches the two and introduces herself to them.<br />
 “Hello, my name is Liz Baker.”<br />
“Hello,” Eric feeling exhausted with being the center of attention; “Name is Eric Anderson.”<br />
“And I’m Spencer Lawson,” Spencer also being polite.<br />
Liz smiles; “oh how sweet. Such manners; always in the last place you look,” she grins; “like a good rutting from a willing mate.”<br />
Eric’s grin slowly fading he repeats what he has said for what seemed like the hundredth time; “Sorry, I’m not interested in anyone but Spencer here and Frieda Knight.”<br />
“That’s okay,” Liz stroking the young were-panther; “but perhaps you wouldn’t mind to turn your threesome into a four way.”<br />
“Not interested,” Eric looking serious; “please accept our apologies, but Spencer and I are heading to the buffet tent to get something to eat.”<br />
“But you haven’t heard what dirty things I can do,” Liz being a little more aggressive and now grabbing Eric by his furry sheathe.<br />
<br />
Spencer having about enough of this were-panthress trying to muscle in growl; “you heard what my mate said, leave us be.”<br />
“Or what,” Liz sneering; “you going to threaten to scratch out my eyes, rip my throat out.” The were-panthress chuckles; “go back to the den young cub, unless of course you want some of my honey.”<br />
<br />
Before Eric could react; Spencer snarls and launches a vicious attack. Using the training her father taught her; Liz was soon on the ground as Spencer digs down on a nerve cluster located at the back of Liz’s neck while Spencer’s knee digs into the were-panthress’s spine, paralyzing Liz and causing her to yowl in pain. With Spencer other hand free, she bares her claws waiting for Liz to try and break free from the paralyzing move.<br />
Hearing the commotion causes Benton Knight to barge through the crowd as everyone witnesses Liz Baker plead and beg to be released. Growling he gets Liz’s and Spencer’s attention as both look at him.<br />
“Who started it,” Benton looking angrily.<br />
 Liv screaming in pain shouts; “this hussy here! She attacked me without cause!”<br />
Both Spencer and Eric snort and shake their heads as they listen to Liz’s outright lie.<br />
“Mr. Knight,” Eric speaking up; “this were-panthress was trying to force herself on me, despite telling her I wasn’t interested. Spencer took exception when Liv mocked her for reminding her to leave us alone.”<br />
<br />
A were-panther who witnessed the exchange stepped forward to confirm what Eric just mentioned. Benton looking at Liz who was clearly in pain just growls; “you heard what my daughter said earlier, yet you just had to ignore her and my warning about forcing your self on one who isn&#39;t willing.”<br />
“Please,” Liz crying in pain; “get her off me.”<br />
Benton still staring at Liz; ”Liz Baker I want you off my property. For daring to attempt the rape of a minor, a child under MY PROTECTION, I hereby expel you from the were-panther pride. And if you ever show up to any social function me or my wife host, you will find how merciless I can be.” Looking at Spencer; “you can let her go know.”<br />
Spencer releases her grips and growls; “next time you’ll think twice about threating someone who was taught how to fight like a marine.”<br />
<br />
Liz who was still in tears and mewling in pain just skulks off, as everyone laughs at her disgrace. With those present being members of the Knight’s social circle in several charity functions; it wasn’t long for word to spread in the pride gathering of Liz’s expulsion and blackballing of any future engagements.<br />
Frieda who missed the exchanged but sensed Spencer’s anger and ease of ending the conflict comes back with plates of food for the three. Handing each Eric and Spencer a plate as Benton watches; Frieda just asks, “So what did I miss?”<br />
“Liz Baker being stupid for the last time,” Benton grumbles; “now she is barred from ever coming here again.”<br />
“Isn’t she the were-panthress that tried to step on mothers paws the last she was here,” Frieda eating her rare roast beef with her paws.<br />
 “The same,” Benton answers; “and Frieda use a fork and knife. You’re not a savage animal.”<br />
“Would you rather Eric, Spencer and myself run off into the woods and hunt down a deer to eat,” Frieda is grinning; “because we can still do that.”<br />
“Well for one thing,” Benton shaking his head; “I want you three nearby where I can keep an eye you. Second, with everyone slowly starting to head off over there to rut, I doubt you’ll find any game to hunt.”<br />
“Well then expect to be up half the night then father,” Frieda laughing; “it’s going to get noisy in my room.”<br />
<br />
Benton groaning at the statement that his daughter just gave and the clear indication as to what it represents; just sighs, “Fine. Finish eating and then go have your fun. With luck you’ll three will tire each other out in an hour or two.&quot;<br />
Eric laughs the blood from the roast beef staining his white furred feline muzzle; “challenge accepted! We’ll shoot for four hours straight instead.”<br />
Spencer and Frieda laughs as well as Benton looks shocked at the young white were-panther’s eagerness and boastfulness. Benton getting in on the laughter grinning all the while; “I’d be surprised if you managed to last for three hours before passing out in exhaustion.”<br />
<br />
Walking to the Buffet tent and seeing Lance with a plate of food; Benton approaches him as Lance rips into the hunk of almost raw meat in his paw.<br />
“Isn’t anyone bothering to use a fork and knife,” Benton looking disgusted at his brother.<br />
“Oh for fucks sake Benton,” Lance looking exasperated; “live a little. Let your little beast out for a bit.”<br />
“I’m saving that for Amanda when she is finally discharge from the hospital,” Benton grinning.<br />
“Not that beast,” Lance picking up on his brother’s innuendo; “I meant the inner animal in you.”<br />
Benton looking serious just shakes his head, “no. Not with my condition. I don’t want to risk losing control.” Benton referring about his bipolar disorder without mentioning it in case there are lingering were’s still within earshot.<br />
“Fair enough,” Lance devouring his meat; “but that doesn’t mean you need to act like an uptight prick all the time.” Lance putting his plate down and handing his brother a USB stick, “articles I found regarding John Shaffer Sr. death ten years ago in Seattle and Cathy Shaffer’s death last Sunday. Why did you want this?”<br />
“You know the old business saying,” Benton clutching the device; “trust but verify.”<br />
“Well whatever John Jr told you,” Lance shaking his head; “must have been a sanitized version, because these articles are rather graphic in detail. Especially John senior’s death. Now if you don’t mind I would like to talk to Frieda before I head on home.”<br />
<br />
I take it you have your own fun planned,” Benton smiling.<br />
“Oh yeah,” Lance grinning; “Lila gave me a sample before I headed over here. Now I’m eager to experience the rest.”<br />
“Well,” Benton looking bemused; “you might have to wait speaking with Frieda. By now, she, Eric and Spencer are probably off for their fun time together.” Benton sighing; “I have a long night as I’m probably going to be up most of the night listening to them go at it.”<br />
Lance laughs as he grabs his paper plate; “then I guess I’ll have to wait tomorrow to talk to Frieda then. Unless of course you wouldn’t mind Lila coming over and the both of us keeping you company.”<br />
“Knowing my daughter is about to have a three way is worrisome enough,” Benton gaging; “I don’t need to hear you and you girl going at it like jack rabbits.” Benton shaking his head as Lance laughs speaks up again; &quot;Oh one other thing.&quot; Benton speaking; &quot;you won&#39;t have to worry about Liz Baker. I just expelled her from the pride for trying to force herself on Eric Anderson.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well that is happy news,&quot; Lance smiling wistfully; &quot;I just hope she isn&#39;t dumb enough to lurk out the front yard waiting for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;If she does,&quot; Benton grinning; &quot;you have my permission to deck her if she tries to make a move on you.&quot;<br />
Lance just grins as he walks back to his car, leaving his older brother to a night of nervous waiting.<br />
<br />
Benton sighing as he looks at the catering staff serving everyone; feeling hungry himself he heads back to the buffet tent to get some rare roast beef and assorted roasted vegetables. Accepting a plate of food from John Shaffer jr. A fourteen year old werewolf stand seven feet in height, Benton casually remarks as he eats with his paws, &quot;have you been hit on yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;With the exception of your daughter sir,&quot; John answering; &quot;every single were-panthress has tried to give me their number. A few that were married, there husbands/mates growled upon hearing this, but when they approach to see me-&quot;<br />
&quot;They see your imposing stature and thought better then to pick a fight with you,&quot; Benton laughing; &quot;just remember, you and the staff are on the clock until midnight.&quot;<br />
John nods as he goes back to serving another were-panther waiting patiently behind Benton.</p>
