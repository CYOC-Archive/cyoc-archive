<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evelyn held back and waited for the others to catch up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got a problem.  There is someone up ahead.  Sitting on the steps of my apartment building,&quot; said Evelyn.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou took off her sunglasses and peered ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what?  It&#39;s just a little girl.  She&#39;s so small I could probably just swallow her in one bite!&quot; said Mary Lou.<br />
<br />
Kim laughed, thinking that Mary Lou was joking.  Evelyn didn&#39;t think it was funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Evelyn.  She&#39;s right.  That little girl can&#39;t hurt us.  Let&#39;s just walk past her.  If she makes a fuss, it won&#39;t really matter.  We can just tell her its a costume, and walk  into your apartment, &quot; said Kim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or I can just scare her away. Rawr, &quot; said Mary Lou, opening her snout, and bearing her teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that will be necessary, &quot; said Kim, as she walked towards the door.  <br />
<br />
Mary Lou followed eagerly, like a puppy.  Evelyn sighed.  She wasn&#39;t sure about this, but Kim had been right so far.  She decided to trust her, and walked to join them.<br />
<br />
The young girl was sitting in the middle of the steps, blocking the door.  Kim and Mary Lou were standing in front of her, waiting for her to move.  They could not get by unless she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, young lady, but I am afraid you have to move.  We need to get by, &quot; said Kim sweetly.<br />
<br />
The young girl looked up, trying to locate the source of the strange voice.  She was shocked by the face of the odd creature that stood before her.  A pair of thick sunglasses hung on a short snout.  A silly hat was covering its head, but she could still see that it had green scaly skin.  Her eyes went wide with shock.<br />
<br />
Kim saw her surprise. &quot;It&#39;s just a costume.  Now, can you move?&quot; said Kim.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s hand shot out and grabbed her leg.  The skin felt soft and warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t feel like a costume,&quot; said the young girl.  She stared at Mary Lou&#39;s face, looking at her yellow reptilian eyes.  &quot;Doesn&#39;t look like a costume either.  It looks real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it is, &quot; hissed Mary Lou.  &quot;Maybe we are really monsters that gobble up little girls who don&#39;t go to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The little girl laughed.  &quot;You aren&#39;t monsters!  Monsters are mean.  But you guys are nice and polite.  What are you really?  Oh, are you superheroes?  Are you in disguise, like when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles need to walk around town?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim chuckled.  &quot;Well, we aren&#39;t turtles.  We are alligators.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, &quot; said the young girl.  &quot;Can I see? Please!  I promise to keep it a secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim sighed.  The young girl was very cute.  She looked around, making sure that no one else was around, then removed her hat and coat.  The girl stared at her in awe.  She stood up and ran around Kim, examining every inch of her body.  She reached forward to touch her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I touch it?&quot; asked the young girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, kid.  Knock yourself out, &quot; said Kim.  She lifted her tail and dropped it down in the girl&#39;s hands.  The girl squealed in glee and began to run her hands along it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you are even better than the Ninja Turtles, &quot; said the girl.  &quot;I bet you could beat them up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Lou scoffed.  &quot;A turtle is no match for a powerful gator, &quot; said Mary Lou.  She disrobed and flexed, producing a small bulging bicep muscle.<br />
<br />
The girl gasped in admiration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kim, we really do need to get going, &quot; said Evelyn anxiously.  She still kept her disguise on.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Evelyn.  Don&#39;t be a spoilsport.  Let the kid have a little fun. She obviously has good taste.  Why don&#39;t you show her what you got?&quot; said Mary Lou.<br />
<br />
The little girl stared at her with sad pleading eyes, the eyes of a puppy begging for a treat.<br />
<br />
Evelyn sighed and rolled her eyes.  She disrobed, and held her garments in her arm as she stood nude for the girl.  The young girl ran up to her and stared with admiration.  She ran her hand along her thigh. Evelyn blushed a little, but had to admit it felt good to be adored.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are so cool.  It must be fun to be a mutant alligator.  Do you like it?&quot; asked the young girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty fun, &quot; said Kim.  She had to admit it was true.  She did like her new body.  She had just begun to explore her new capabilities, but she already liked what little she had experienced.<br />
<br />
Evelyn was a little disturbed by Kim&#39;s response.  She was getting a little too comfortable in her new body.  She wondered what ideas Mary Lou had been planting in her head. But the little girl&#39;s response was even more disturbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I could become one, too?  Please?&quot; asked the young girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe one day, child.  Maybe one day, &quot; said Mary Lou, as she ruffled the kid&#39;s hair and walked past her up the stairs.  &quot;C&#39;mon, girls. We still have work to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim gave the girl a wink and a smile, then followed Mary Lou into the apartment complex.  Evelyn hung behind, and leaned down to talk to the girl. She motioned for the girls to go ahead without her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; asked Evelyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy,&quot; replied the girl proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Amy, we need your help.  We are on a very secret mission, and we can&#39;t let people know we are here.  Can you help us, Amy?  Can you keep our secret, and tell no one you saw us?&quot; asked Evelyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then can I be a superhero like you?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, &quot; said Evelyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, &quot; said Amy. &quot;I won&#39;t tell anyone.  Cross my heart and hope to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn smiled.  The child was undeniably cute.  &quot;Why do you want to be a superhero so bad? And why are you out here all by herself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy face suddenly crumpled into the saddest expression Evelyn had ever seen.  &quot;My Mom and Dad fight alot, so I come out here to get away.  Sometimes he really hurts her, and it makes me sad.  So I thought if I was superhero like you, maybe I could help her.  And make Daddy be nicer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn was heartbroken.  She hadn&#39;t know this kid had such terrible problems.  She didn&#39;t even know this kid lived in the same building before this morning.  The thought of some bastard hurting an innocent child like that made her blood boil.  She felt her muscles tense as adrenaline surged through her body.  She thought about making a little visit to her Dad, maybe teach him a little lesson about how to respect women.  She could always change back later.  But then again, she could always just call the police after she was human again.</p>
