<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They left the car and became just some of many entering the auditorium. Cheerleaders in a myriad of colors were entering the building. Mike stuck closely to Sharon and Mary. <br />
<br />
Mrs Maloney spotted them as the entered the room, she sent Mary and Mike through a door to meetup with the rest of the team and following a wish of good luck Sharon left to find herself a seat.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the afternoon Mike was kept very busy, when they weren&#39;t performing on the stage Coach had her practicing the next performance. She didn&#39;t have time to contemplate the situation she found herself in. Mike must have done well or at least better than expected. The feedback she got from coach was very positive and the other team members were friendly to her. It probably helped that the team had done well and had somehow qualified for finals on the next afternoon. <br />
<br />
By the time the days events finished Mike was both famished and exhausted. She would not admit it to anyone but she had actually enjoyed the experience. <br />
<br />
She was a bit put off when she located Sharon after they were told to head back to the hotel. Sharon gave her a hug and said &#39;You were superb Mary. I&#39;m so proud of you&#39;<br />
<br />
Embarrassed Mike had to pull out of her embrace and point out which of Sharon&#39;s children she was. Sharon&#39;s only response was to say &#39;You did well also Mike&#39;<br />
<br />
Back in their unit Mike while waiting for Mary to shower Mike raised the idea to Sharon of regaining his own body. She had figured out it was over 12 hours before &quot;Michelle&quot; the cheerleader had to appear again. Enough time for her to change twice. <br />
<br />
However Sharon quickly put a stop to that idea. &#39;Sorry Mike. We are having a team dinner tonight. Michelle will be expected to be there. You are part of the team now. And by the time dinner has finished you won&#39;t have 12 hours&#39;<br />
<br />
It was a small consolation to be able to shower in her female body. The previous day she had struggled to get Mary&#39;s approval to visit the toilet. She could remember Mary saying &#39;I not letting that pervert check out my body&#39; but tonight it was different. Her only command was a suggestion to &#39;Wash you hair&#39; <br />
<br />
Mike stayed in the shower as long as possible. The feeling of warm water running over her breasts was something totally new. She also tried as best as she could to examine what was currently her vagina but had difficulty craning her head far enough. She did discover her clitoris though. It was very sensitive. <br />
<br />
She had to pull her finger out very quickly when Sharon barged into the bathroom. &#39;I&#39;ll need to dry your hair and help you dress. You will find that being female it will take a bit longer to get ready to go out&#39;<br />
<br />
So Mike soon found herself wrapped in a white hotel dressing gown as Sharon dried and styled her hair. Once that was finished Sharon took her to the master bedroom where Mike&#39;s outfit for the night was revealed.<br />
<br />
Mike was not as impressed as Sharon expected when she showed him the black midi slip dress she had purchased for Mike to wear at the team dinner. She was also disappointed that Mike wasn&#39;t keen to put on the heeled sandals she thought would go so well with the dress. When she was the twins age she had been so thrilled when her mother had for the first time allowed her to wear heels.<br />
<br />
She had to help Mike into the black bra and panty set she had purchased. Mike only agreed to get dressed when Sharon promised that she would allow Mike to use the medallion immediately once the cheerleading competition was finished. <br />
<br />
Sharon thought the dress looked great on Mike. She offered to lend Mike some of her bangles and a necklace which she thought would set off the outfit but Mike refused them. She even was initially reluctant to allow Sharon to fix her make-up. Sharon had to point out that in the deal they had made regarding the medallion Mike had agreed to get dressed up. And as Sharon pointed out &#39;for a woman make-up is part of your outfit&#39;<br />
<br />
Sharon was so proud a half hour later when she walked into the restaurant with her two very grown-up looking daughters. Mary in light blue and Mike or Michelle as she was now calling her, in black. She noticed Michelle had even mastered to art of walking in heels.</p>
