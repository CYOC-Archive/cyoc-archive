<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ned Evrymin reclines on the couch after a long boring week at his tedious job. Thankfully, he had spent an entire year and a half saving up for a product made and shipped from M8 corp. Creating the love of his life was just what he needed to bring back some joy for him. Unfortunately, he had quite a few specifications he didn&#39;t want people to learn about just yet, so he had kept everything secret from those he knew up to this point. And now, it was the day she would arrive.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door made Ned spring up from his position, opening to find a very tall box being wheeled into his domicile by a delivery worker. Reducing the cost by not having his love shrunk, Ned signed for the package and closed the door. No hesitation as he ripped open the front to view the start of his new not lonely life. He fell back as he was smacked in the face by a pair of breasts, jiggling now that they weren&#39;t pressed against the box. &quot;So this is my new home, huh? Not bad, I guess.&quot; A sultry, accented voice says. Standing in Ned&#39;s foyer was a goddess of a woman. A tall artificial human, easily standing 9ft, if not more so thanks to the heels she wore. <br />
<br />
As per Ned&#39;s wishes, M8&#39;s efficiency was at work here, for she ticked every box for him. Dark skinned, this amazonian was fit and slightly muscular, which one wouldn&#39;t immediately notice. Her curves took one&#39;s attention immediately, with her ginormous chocolate colored breasts were listed as the largest size M8 ever produced, a Q cup. Yet, despite their size and weight, they only slightly were affected by gravity, being perfectly shaped, squishy, and perky. Her erect nipples were sensitive as heck; though moving south now. Her hips was almost as wide as her tits, with her ass being very full, plump and jiggly. Her upper thighs were thick as well, creating a voluptuous hourglass figure. Though the rest of her body had minimal fat, just enough to look svelte and shapely. Her pussy was slightly plumped up and had maximum sensitivity both in and out. With normal human-like arms and hands, she looked capable of bench pressing and lifting as much as most men. Her head was not at all human, though. With a general shape more reminiscent of a snake of reptile, though covered with the same dark skin as the rest of her body. At the front of what would be a snout was a pair of oversized plump lips; describable more as DSL&#39;s, they had black lipstick and leaked saliva. Inside were no teeth, though this didn&#39;t hinder her pronunciation of words. With no other facial features and completely devoid of hair anywhere, she was Ned&#39;s dream come true.<br />
<br />
With heeled sandals, denim cutoff shorts accentuating her ass, and a tight top making her tits spill out the top, she licked her lips as she picked Ned up. &quot;Well Master, I take it I&#39;m exactly to your liking?&quot; she asks, rubbing his groin. He smirked and nodded, feeling his rod stiffen immediately from the sight of her. It wasn&#39;t just this causing his reaction; he had also asked M8 to make his love secret pheromones that only he could smell, and have her sweat contain an aphrodisiac, both of which only affect him. As an added bonus, M8 made her body prone to getting sweaty easily. &quot;Mmmm, I can&#39;t wait to just get right to pounding you.&quot; She moaned, mushing Ned&#39;s face into her tits. &quot;I just want to feel your cum filling up my womb, baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But first,&quot; she stated, placing Ned on the couch again. &quot;Let me start moving in first.&quot; She reached into the box and pulled out a couple of suitcases. M8 had (for an extra fee) created a whole wardrobe for her size and proportions. Nearly all of them were scanty and revealing, though with plenty of full body suits for Ned&#39;s biggest fetish. Being a gentleman, Ned helped her out, making space in his closet for her shoes and clothes, after removing everything else that was in there to make space. <br />
 <br />
Ned couldn&#39;t stop tingling every second he was near this beauty. She had been created with a dominant and overbearing personality. Her kicks were gained from leading Ned around, though she would always deeply love him. &quot;Thanks for helping me settle in, hon.&quot; She said, pushing Ned onto his bed. &quot;It&#39;s nice to have a gentleman around for me to love.&quot; Smiling, Ned laid back as she reached her head down locked her plump, soft lips with Ned&#39;s. Her saliva tasted very sweet, made even sweeter since her tongue was probing around Ned&#39;s mouth, licking every inch of it. Her sweat and pheromones go into effect, making Ned&#39;s rod lengthen to a number he&#39;s never had before. His eyes roll back, nearly cumming just from this kiss, Ned takes note of her clothes. Seeing a black leather suit with cutoffs for the hands and feet area, he&#39;d love to see her wearing it. &quot;So tell me, what would you like me to call you?&quot; He asks, when the kiss is broken for a moment. Smiling, the artificial woman says, &quot;Call me Zianna, or Zi for short.&quot; Before going back to kissing him.</p>
