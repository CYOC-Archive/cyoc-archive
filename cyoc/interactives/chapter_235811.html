<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As everyone gathered around Billie, asking her questions and marveling at her transformation, Maria couldn&#39;t help but ask, &quot;How does it feel, Billie? Is it weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie looked down at her new appendage, a grin spreading across her face. &quot;It feels... different. But not in a bad way. It&#39;s like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before,&quot; she said, her voice filled with wonder.<br />
<br />
Grace, her curiosity piqued, leaned forward. &quot;Billie, do you have balls too?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Billie chuckled, nodding. &quot;Yeah, I do. It&#39;s a whole package deal,&quot; gesturing to her new anatomy.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Andy and Maddy remained silent, both clearly uncomfortable with the situation. Maddy was still backed up against the wall, while Andy was deliberately avoiding eye contact with Billie.<br />
<br />
Lucas noticed Andy&#39;s discomfort and gave him a nod. Andy looked up, forcing a smile. &quot;You okay, man?&quot; Lucas asked.<br />
<br />
Andy nodded, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m good,&quot; he said, his voice tight.<br />
<br />
Lucas gestured towards the door. &quot;You wanna take it outside, just talk for a bit?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Andy nodded eagerly, clearly relieved at the suggestion. &quot;Yeah, that sounds good,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Lucas turned to Grace, giving her a quick kiss on the cheek. &quot;I&#39;m gonna talk with Andy for a bit. I won&#39;t make a wish without you, don&#39;t worry,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Grace smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. &quot;You better not,&quot; she said, playfully poking him in the chest.<br />
<br />
The two made their way out of the dorm room and into the kitchen, leaving the others behind. Maddy watched them go, her mind racing with thoughts. She looked over at Billie, who was enthusiastically playing with her new appendage, and made up her mind. She followed Andy and Lucas into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
As she entered the kitchen, she found Andy pacing back and forth, his face flushed with anxiety. Lucas was leaning against the counter, his arms crossed over his chest as he tried to console Andy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with me, man,&quot; Andy was saying, his voice filled with frustration. &quot;I&#39;m gay, but... but that thing is... it’s obviously a penis or whatever, but it’s attached to her. And it&#39;s attractive. I don&#39;t know how to feel about this,&quot; he admitted, running a hand through his hair as he always did when he was stressed.<br />
<br />
Lucas nodded understandingly. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Andy. This is a weird situation, I’m pretty sure we’re our brains aren’t meant to try and understand this,&quot; he said, his voice reassuring.<br />
<br />
Maddy cleared her throat, announcing her presence. Andy and Lucas turned to look at her, their eyes filled with surprise. &quot;Mind if I join you guys?&quot; she asked, her voice soft.<br />
<br />
Andy nodded, gesturing for her to come in. &quot;Sure.&quot; he asked, his voice still filled with anxiety.<br />
<br />
Maddy sighed, leaning against the counter next to Lucas. &quot;I&#39;m feeling weird about this too. I&#39;m a lesbian, but... but seeing Billie like that, it&#39;s... it&#39;s making me feel a very… different way. And I don’t know how I feel about it,&quot; she admitted.<br />
<br />
Andy looked at her, his eyes filled with understanding. &quot;I get it. I guess we’re like totally on the other side of the spectrum from each other,&quot; he chuckled, finding some irony in this confusing situation.<br />
<br />
Lucas chimed in, his voice soft. &quot;I think it&#39;s because it&#39;s new and different. It&#39;s not something we&#39;re used to seeing, so it&#39;s piquing our curiosity,&quot; he suggested.<br />
<br />
Andy looked at him. &quot;You think so?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Lucas nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. &quot;Yeah, I do. And... and I&#39;ll admit, I thought it was hot too,&quot; he said, his voice filled with a mix of embarrassment and amusement. They all awkwardly laughed together<br />
<br />
&quot;So… you&#39;re not straight?&quot; Andy asked, his voice filled with intrigue.<br />
<br />
Lucas shrugged, a small smile on his face. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never really labeled myself. I just know I like women. And I know I really like Grace… but this is something I’ve just kinda ignored,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
The three of them fell silent, each lost in their own thoughts. After a moment, Andy spoke up, his voice filled with determination. &quot;I know what I&#39;m going to wish for,&quot; he said, a smirk playing on his lips.<br />
<br />
Maddy and Lucas looked at him, their eyes filled with curiosity. &quot;What are you going to wish for?&quot; Maddy asked, her voice filled with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s smirk grew wider, and he declared, &quot;I wish I was a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment the words left Andy&#39;s mouth, a wave of transformation began to sweep over him. He gasped, his eyes widening in shock as he felt his body beginning to change. The first thing he noticed was his height; he was shrinking, his frame becoming more petite. He looked down, watching as his body hair started to disappear, his skin becoming smooth and hairless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Maddy whispered, her eyes wide with shock as she watched Andy&#39;s transformation unfold.<br />
<br />
Lucas, equally stunned, could only stare in amazement. &quot;Oh my…&quot; he murmured.<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s chest began to change next, his broad, muscular frame softening and becoming more delicate. <br />
His waist narrowed, and his hips began to widen, giving him an hourglass figure. He could feel his jeans growing tighter around his expanding hips and and especially around his slowly swelling ass, the fabric straining against his new curves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, this is so weird,&quot; Andy said, his voice already taking on a softer, more feminine tone. He reached down, grabbing at his crotch as he felt his penis slowly receding, transforming into a newly forming slit. The sensation was unlike anything he had ever experienced, and he let out a small gasp, his face flushing with a mix of shock and arousal.<br />
<br />
His feet began to shrink as well, and he quickly kicked off his shoes, which were now too big for him. He looked down at his loose shirt, noticing that his nipples were protruding, becoming more prominent. Slowly, his breasts began to grow, swelling and filling out until they were easily DDs. He cupped them, feeling their weight and fullness, a shiver of pleasure running through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Andy, you&#39;re... you&#39;re gorgeous,&quot; Maddy said, her voice filled with awe as she watched Andy&#39;s transformation come to an end.<br />
<br />
Lucas nodded in agreement, his eyes wide with admiration. &quot;You really are. This is... this is amazing,&quot; he said, his voice filled with wonder.<br />
<br />
Andy looked down at his new body, his eyes wide with shock and excitement. His short hair still framed his face, but his features were now more feminine, his jawline softer and his eyelashes longer. His clothes were loose and ill-fitting, barely clinging to his new curves. He ran his hands over his body, marveling at the changes, a sense of arousal and excitement coursing through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this… this works,&quot; Andy said, his voice filled with wonder. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m a woman. And I’m a hot woman!&quot; he added, a grin spreading across his face.<br />
<br />
Maddy and Lucas looked at each other, then back at Andy. They really were shocked by the whole thing, but so amazed too. It made them both think of the possibilities of this wishing thing. The heads racing with more and more ideas. But deep down, they both had a feeling they knew what they were going to wish for.</p>
