<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wendy felt more than a little self-conscious standing there waiting for the transformation process to begin. Having to walk around naked inside <br />
the park was one thing. It wouldn't really be her body, just some elaborate costume in a sense. Here though, she just felt like she was being <br />
watched. Everyone seemed rather cagey about how this process worked exactly, and for all she knew there was a team of fifty people <br />
monitoring her with some hidden camera. She was shortly distracted from her worries by the sensation of her ears elongating and moving up <br />
the side of her head. While still covering herself with one hand, she reached up to feel them in wonderment. Shortly, this was followed by a <br />
flattening of her chest, and a thick coat of short fur sprouting all over her body. At that point, she abandoned theoretical modesty, curious to <br />
study each change as it happened. She gained a few inches in height, and her shoulders broadened, causing her to herself just where the extra <br />
mass could be coming from. A small fluffy tail emerged from behind her as she felt the structure of the muscles in her legs change rather <br />
drastically, and finally of course, she leaned forward to watch in fascination as a penis and testicles emerged from somewhere within. He had to <br />
giggle a bit at the size, imagining Terry backing away from it in horror as she moved in to give him a hug. She might even play around with it a <br />
little before it was time to leave.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the chamber, Wendy's gait was a little awkward and bowlegged, as she took overly much care making sure not to pinch her new <br />
equipment somehow. A passing panther girl giggled at the sight, and called out to her, &quot;They tend to take care of themselves you know! Just <br />
try and walk normally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy laughed back. Just how often did people change sexes when they came here. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said. &quot;So is there some sort of map to this <br />
place? I'm just here for a quick visit with my boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyfriend? I guess you weren't planning to make it a conjugal one then huh? Anyway, there's no technology of any sort allowed inside, that <br />
includes maps. Do you know what he came in as?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a rabbit too. Came in here about two weeks ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
The panther gave a low whistle. &quot;He actually told you he was coming as a rabbit and you let him do it!? Either you must have the most open <br />
relationship in the world, or you're the definition of gullible. I get why you'd want to check on him, but I can tell you right now, yes, he's <br />
cheating on you. Probably with a dozen different women, maybe even all at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, he'd never dream of it. He's strictly here on business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that's what he told you, and he may even have meant it, but trust me man, it's just how rabbits are wired. I'd watch out for it yourself, <br />
especially if you head for the warrens. See those hills over there in the distance? Just head that way and start looking around for the entrance to <br />
a tunnel. It's pretty hard to miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again,&quot; said Wendy as she started to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and one more thing! Since you're clearly new to the whole 'male' thing, there's a guy named Brian who usually holds a sort of gender <br />
dysphoria support group right near here. Mostly for people who hit that random button not realizing how random it was. I'd check it out if I <br />
were you. He's usually hanging around to flag'em down as they enter, but he's taking the day off. There's some odd little athletic contest he <br />
was going to see apparently... and oh! It's rare, but some people are a bit intolerant to the whole genderbending thing. Might want to come up <br />
with an alias for yourself while you're here!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Brian had heard some ugly rumors about this 'tournament' being held today. He'd heard from his predecessor Hannah about the last big <br />
contest the park's bucks had held. The way it whipped all the deer into a frenzy. Hannah herself had apparently been driven half-mad with lust, <br />
and of course everyone knew about Leticia. There'd also been talk of a bet between some of them, about converting some of the losers to does <br />
and evening out the population. As a former woman whose transition had been something of an accident, he was deeply insulted by the notion <br />
of treating such a thing as some kind of punishment. Not even due simply to the profoundly misogynistic attitude it represented, but knowing <br />
how traumatic that sort of change could be first hand. He'd come to accept it of course. Running his meetings would be rather difficult if he <br />
hadn't, but at the time he might have lost his mind if he hadn't had the support of the rest of the group. One way or the other, he was sure <br />
someone would need his kind of insight before the day was done. As the first round of face-offs began, he took another look around. Several <br />
does were perched up on a pile of rocks, obviously getting a bit excited. They'd probably all end up doing something they might regret in the <br />
morning, but he didn't see anyone from his group in the mix. Two more bucks collided in the center of the clearing with a clatter of antlers. <br />
Seeing the display, he felt a sudden surge of passionate energy flowing through him. He found himself wondering if he should actually try and <br />
enter. There was a formal bracketed system at play, but apparently there were a number of wild card slots available for latecomers, at least in <br />
today's matches. It wasn't that he wanted to impress the does (although he wouldn't at all mind the extra attention). His understanding was <br />
that the winner would have a fair deal of influence over this unruly lot, and certainly someone had to instill in them the fundamentals of <br />
feminism. And he'd have a good shot, too. The one thing that hadn't changed when he came to the park was how often he'd been told he had a <br />
real magnificent rack, after all.<br />
<br />
Continuing to survey the scene, he was surprised to see a pair of the huskies working on security taking time out for a bit of flirting. He didn't <br />
recognize either one, but he instantly recognized the look of anxious confusion on the girl's face. The huskies didn't usually come to his <br />
meetings. Something about minimizing interactions with the guests to maintain impartiality. Rather hilarious with Naomi herself seeing <br />
Charlotte. Still, she looked like she could use his brand of advice.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Goldie had begged to be assigned to this security detail, still thinking of Chad like some externalized version of her former self. Harry had been <br />
strongly opposed to the idea, as she still hadn't had any proper hand to hand training, but Zack had spoken up for her. It had really been the <br />
first request of any kind she'd made as a husky, other than constantly volunteering to take an extra lap on patrols, do an extra 20 pushups. <br />
Whatever extra display of commitment came to mind. Besides which, the stags were roughing themselves up plenty. Whatever issue might <br />
come up, they'd be too exhausted for a physical confrontation with security. Zack himself had some other duty to take care of, making this the <br />
her first day on the job without his direct oversight. It was also her first time really working with any of the other new recruits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goldie wasn't it? I'm Sam. You probably don't remember me, but we joined up on the same day. Why is it I never see you out on patrol?&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie felt her tail droop. He had to know her story. Everyone did. She was a bully and a sociopath who'd dug her own grave with a humiliating <br />
body. Not really fit to be a part of the pack, and just kept around to tease and so she could rat out her former associates. Was this some sort of <br />
test? Was he hoping she'd lie, proving she was just as selfish and arrogant as ever? &quot;Sir, I'm not allowed to head out on regular assignments, <br />
sir!&quot; she barked, loud enough to turn a few heads from the crowd in her direction. &quot;I am considered a danger to the park, and allowed only to <br />
operate under direct supervision of my superiors, sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam laughed. &quot;So you're saying it's some top secret project then, and I shouldn't pry, huh? I can respect that. You need a better cover story <br />
though. The higher ups are always talking about you, and I've overheard enough to say it's all complimentary. I've personally heard Zack say <br />
you were the most loyal and hardworking husky he'd seen since Naomi, whoever that is, so you should at least say you're sneaking off with him <br />
to make out in the woods all day. Gotta make it at least a little believable. And will you stop it with the 'sir' talk? If anything, you outrank me, <br />
and the shouting is distracting everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she replied, downcast. Was that what this was about? She'd thought Zack might finally have been coming close to forgiving her, maybe <br />
he'd even suggested she be transfered to the normal training program. That had to be it. He'd put in a good word, they thought she'd found <br />
some way to bribe him, or blackmail him, and that's why he wasn't here to monitor him. They were questioning them separately. &quot;No, I'm fully <br />
aware I am still on indefinite probation, as I should be. I would never ask for, or accept an improved assignment. If Zack suggested otherwise, <br />
I'm sure he was joking, and if there is any fear that he is being too soft on me, I am perfectly willing to be assigned a new supervisor from <br />
anywhere in the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Don't talk like that!&quot; Sam grabbed her by the shoulders. &quot;Look at me.&quot; She did. &quot;I don't know what it is you feel you have to beat yourself <br />
up over, but I can tell you the only one here who's trying to punish you for anything is yourself. From everything I have heard you are a loyal <br />
husky, a fantastic person, and a beautiful woman. Now anytime that voice in your head tries to tell you any different, you come find me and I <br />
swear I will prove it's lying.&quot; As she stood there blinking in confusion, he pulled her into a tight hug, and gave her a lick on the snout that was <br />
almost a kiss. Her heart started racing as she felt a mix of fear, confusion and... something else. She'd been trying to submit to her canine <br />
instincts. When she was given an order, she'd follow without question. From any husky, not even just from her superiors. But here her instincts <br />
were completely at odds with any sort of logic. He was telling her not to feel guilty when obviously she was still a terrible person. She knew she <br />
was being teased worse than ever about looking female, and that she was clearly really a man, but her instincts were also telling her that she <br />
should just leap into Sam's arms. While she tried to process all this, she heard a sickening crack from the clearing. Snapping back to action, she <br />
rushed out to check if buck's injuries were serious. Ignoring, as best she could, how much he deserved it.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Chad grinned. It didn't seem fair to him to be taking a few pledges down personally. Especially this one. Dweebie little Shaun. He had the same <br />
body as everyone else now sure, but inside he was still a little wimp. He'd have to be nice when he had HER at his beck and call tomorrow. <br />
Vinny gave the signal and they charged forward. As their antlers entwined he felt a sharp jolt, and suddenly everything went black.<br />
<br />
When he came to, people were crowded around him. He'd lost? What the hell kind of lucky blow was that? Little twerp must have done some <br />
martial arts, trigonometry thing and hit him just right. It was cool though, he'd still win this. Took two falls to be eliminated, he'd just have to <br />
beat the last guy twice was all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to say it Chad, but it looks like you're out early,&quot; said Vinny.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No way! It's double elimination.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Chad, doesn't your balance feel off? You can't fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
What the hell did he mean by that? He wasn't bleeding, he was standing straight. His head just felt like something was leaning on one side but <br />
otherwise...<br />
<br />
That's when he saw the antler in Vinny's hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snapped clean off. One in a million thing. You're lucky it didn't cave your skull in too. I know neither of us saw it coming but... you signed the <br />
pledge, and the contract with the staff. First half to lose loses their their antlers, and hey, you're halfway there already. On the plus side, if you <br />
have any internal damage, going back through the changing room should fix it, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Terry had long since given up on her project... and on any sense of modesty. Spring was in the air, and the smell of blooming flowers just <br />
seemed to heighten... everything. She wasn't even bothering to find private nooks anymore. She'd just stagger off to find some water, grab <br />
some carrots or a head of lettuce, and as soon as she was back in the safety of the tunnels, she'd just grab the first buck in sight and... buck. <br />
Her life had just become a constant state of bliss.<br />
<br />
She was midway her second round of the day with Tim, when she saw Katerina introducing a new buck to the warrens. He seemed a bit nervous <br />
as she flirted a bit, and turned away in shock when he realized what they were doing just around the corner. As he turned though, she had a <br />
chance to see just what a juicy carrot he seemed to have. Once Tim took another rest, she'd have to say hello.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Wally,&quot; said Katerina, &quot;we did have a Terry check in recently, but... she seems a little busy right now. While we wait for her to finish up, can <br />
I show you around?&quot;</p>
