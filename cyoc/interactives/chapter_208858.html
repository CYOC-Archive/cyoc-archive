<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark gathered up the satyr pants and horns, heading into the only open changing room. It was surprisingly spacious as changing rooms went, but was still pretty plain and utilitarian. There was a full length mirror on the wall, a stool in the corner, and various hooks to hang clothes on littered around the room. Mark gently draped the costume over one of the hooks, double-checked that he had locked the door, and then began to change.<br />
<br />
He was happy the room had an actual door instead of a loose curtain. He didn&#39;t exactly have time to worry about peeping toms. Mark tugged off his shoes and socks, storing them under the stool before casually peeling off his shirt. He hung it up soon a spare hook before looking down at his blue jeans.<br />
<br />
Merlin had said to take them off. His reasoning make sense... He didn&#39;t want the costume to look like a lumpy pair of blue jeans. Mark not-so-casually tugged them off, hanging them on the same hook as his shirt. If anyone was looking in, all they were getting was a good look of his heart-print boxers.<br />
<br />
Alright, now then, how did he actually get this costume on? Mark picked the satyr pants back up, turning them over in his hands. They almost looked like a pair of furry long long johns. They had a few features that identified them as satyr pants however, or at least goat pants. On the rear of the pants was a short stubby tail, and down at the end of each leg was a glossy cloven hoof. They were sewn into the pants, and it wasn&#39;t immediately apparent how one was expected to stand on them. On the inside of the pants was some sort of slick nylon or silk material.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here goes nothing...&quot; Merlin took a deep breath, experimentally sliding one foot in.<br />
<br />
It felt like stepping into a pair of pants, naturally. The silky material was surprisingly comfortable, maybe even a little warm to the touch. Mark leaned against the wall, pushing his foot deeper and deeper into the outfit. Finally his toes hit the end of the legging, coming to a hard stop at the hoof.<br />
<br />
It must have been hallow on the inside or something. They didn&#39;t look that big on the outside, but there was definitely some sort of platform for the balls of his feet. As silly as it sounded, it felt like there was an individual groove for each of his toes. Everything was remarkably sturdy once he slid it into place.<br />
<br />
Mark experimentally put the hoof on the floor, trying to shift some weight to it. It felt odd, like the costume was forcing him to stand on the tip-toes of his feet. Still, he got a surprisingly good amount of traction on the hoof. He was confident enough to at least try pulling on the other pant leg. It took considerably more effort to stay upright this time, but he managed to get his other foot secure in the fake plastic hoof. At least, he assumed it was plastic. It looked like real keratin, but that was preposterous.<br />
<br />
With both of his feet in place, Mark started to pull the pants up. The fur clung eagerly to his legs, no doubt there was some sort of static cling built up on the inner lining. As strange as the tip-toe posture was, he had to admit that the effect looked good. Now that he had gotten the fur up over his knees, one could almost believe that his legs were bent like an upright goat. Almost.<br />
<br />
As he pulled the pants up further, the pleasant sensation of the costume clinging to him abruptly stopped. When he tried to pull the fur up over his boxers, everything suddenly got clumped up. The fur didn&#39;t want to lay flat anymore, and everything suddenly started looking lumpy and fake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this what he was talking about...?&quot; Mark gave the pants a firm tug, trying to pull them up further. They didn&#39;t even feel like the right size anymore...! Merlin said not to wear his clothes underneath the pants, but surely he didn&#39;t mean underwear, right? Were these pants seriously designed for someone going commando?<br />
<br />
Ugh, he didn&#39;t really have time to go back and try to find a larger pair of pants. If taking his boxers off would make the costume work, he could deal with the awkwardness for a few hours tonight. Mark reached down and tugged on one of the hooves.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t budge.<br />
<br />
He tugged a bit harder, and he momentarily felt it slid away from his toes. As soon as he stopped tugging through, it immediately snapped back into place. What the heck...? This thing was super-clingy. Mark wobbled over to the stool, plopping down on it so that he could get a bit better leverage. Eventually his legs started to slide out of the pants, but it took a surprising amount of effort.<br />
<br />
Mark didn&#39;t expect to find himself wearing nothing but boxers in a changing room again so soon. This was the moment of truth though. He double-checked that there were no obvious gaps, holes, or cameras set up in the room, and then hastily slid out of his boxers.<br />
<br />
Seconds later, his feet were back in the faux hooves. He quickly pulled the fur his legs, doing the best to cover himself. The pants didn&#39;t have any issues clinging to his skin as he tugged the material up his thighs. All he had to do was pull the fur up over his nudity and he&#39;d be set-<br />
<br />
Whoa! That felt weird! Mark reflexively let go of the fur as it passed up over his crotch. He was expecting the pants to simply cover his manhood, but instead he felt his cock and balls slide into some sort of... pouch?<br />
<br />
Glancing down between his legs, Mark confirmed that he could see some sort of tuff of brown fur between his legs. The elastic on the pant&#39;s waistband had snapped into place when he had accidentally let go, and everything was being held in surprisingly good place. He tentatively reached down to rub then tuff and- Yup! That was his cock alright...! The bulge between his legs wasn&#39;t exactly subtile, even with the coating of fur. Did this costume seriously have a sheath!?<br />
<br />
This was ridiculous! He wasn&#39;t going to spend the whole night strutting around with a sheath between his- Yow!<br />
<br />
Mark spun around, trying to figure out what had pinched the small of his back. There wasn&#39;t anything out of place, just a furry waist line, and the wagging goat- Oh wow, the costume&#39;s tail was lazily swinging back and forth in a really cool way whenever he moved.<br />
<br />
Mark looked up at the mirror, taking in his reflection for the first time. This whole getup actually looked really good. He reached out to the nearby hook, gently plucking the horn headband from off the wall. He nestled it on his head, doing his best to balance the weight, and brush his hair over the plastic band so it wasn&#39;t quite so obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad, not bad...&quot; Mark turned in front of the mirror, letting out a fake, &quot;Baah!&quot;<br />
<br />
This might actually work. The costume wasn&#39;t perfect. Its snugness aside, Mark wasn&#39;t the most hairy guy. It was a little odd to see a full coat of goat fur turn into a smooth belly without the faintest hint of a treasure trail. Still, the hooves were becoming easier to stand on the longer he wore them. It certainly wasn&#39;t a toga, but maybe he could put a new spin on &quot;greek life&quot; tonight.<br />
<br />
Or... Maybe he&#39;s make a fool of himself. As Mark made his way to the door, he couldn&#39;t help but feel how much a draft this little changing room seemed to have. Half this costume was a pair of goat legs, but the other half was just shirtless him. Was he really ready to spend the whole night like this? Maybe he could wear the furry pants and his t-shirt? Heck, his jeans might fit over the satyr pants.<br />
<br />
Wait, how was he even going to get back to the frat house? Was he seriously going to walk (err, clop) back like this? Maybe throwing on his clothes on wouldn&#39;t be the worst idea. Was there still time to change back into his street clothes and then change back into the costume at the house? Mark clopped around anxiously, trying to make up his mind.</p>
