<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just a few weeks are left and our summer break will finally end, yet Teddy and I haven’t even tried going on a trip together. We, together with families, have been planning to go to the beach like what we do annually, but a lot of things happened and we didn’t get to do what is set. Luckily, all are now settled. We are on our way to the beach!<br />
<br />
Arriving on the shore, me and my parents met Teddy and the Jones Family, carrying their baggages. We all headed together to the hotel. Our rooms are just in front of each other so we can knock at each other’s door whenever needed. After unpacking, Teddy and I ran off to the beach without hesitation just to look at the good view.<br />
<br />
Teddy Jones has been my greatest friend in the whole wide universe. Every since we were children, we never really separated from each other. We went to the same school up until now that we are both 16. I was so fortunate that even our families are in good terms.<br />
<br />
“Dang. This beach is so worth the wait!” He said as he stretched his arms upwards<br />
<br />
He looked back at me and smiled. “What do you think, Jack?” He asked.<br />
<br />
I must agree. Even if it took us too long to be in this trip, it truly is worth it. Especially today that only a few people are in the beach since the summer break is about to end.<br />
<br />
“Yup.” I replied. “Wanna look around for a while before changing into our swimming clothes?”<br />
<br />
He replied by nodding so I started walking away from him and he followed.<br />
<br />
We came across the shop aisle. There are a variety of souvenirs and foods that interests me a lot. Since I didn’t really bring any money on me, we just decided to take a walk and stare at thing.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, we arrived in front of a store which caught both of our attention. At first I couldn’t read the signage well well because of how it was made and some of the letters are missing. On first glance I misread it as “Shift Shop” but now that I took a closer analyzation, I think they meant “Shirt Shop”.<br />
<br />
We both entered the door and the first thing that I noticed was that it was filled with so many things like necklaces, bracelets, jewelries, shoes, socks, and keychains, and the number of shirts that they sell were less than how it supposed to be since this was a shirt shop, so I felt a bit silly about the owner.<br />
<br />
As we both scan the whole shop, a man came across us and greeted us with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Good afternoon! Aren’t you guys a little too late to enjoy the summer?” He asked.<br />
<br />
We both just laughed, but I think Teddy felt embarrassed like how I am feeling right now. The man then tapped on the air with his index finger and walked away from us. Teddy’s forehead furrowed as he look over the man, curious of what he’s up to. We both followed him to the counter where he placed a box which he was presenting to us.<br />
<br />
“I think I know another way for you kids to enjoy the ever-so-short summer break left.” He opened the box and showed us a pair of hand cuffs.<br />
<br />
The cuffs themselves were made up of leather and was both connected by a metal chain which seems easy to be broken. We both looked at him confused and he reacted with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“These cuffs are specially made for best friends. Both of you can wear the cuffs, one for each.”<br />
<br />
Still confused, we looked at him.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me sir, but is this a joke?” I asked him and Teddy smacked me on my shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Have some respect, at least, Jack.” He said.<br />
<br />
Still the man reacted with a chuckle and replied “Why not test it out in the back?”.<br />
<br />
He then guided us to a dressing room. I was starting to feel scared, like what if we are going to be kid napped. I showed my worry to Teddy, but instead he told me that if it’s so, we shouldn’t protest and ride on.<br />
<br />
We then entered the dressing room. First, Teddy wore one of the cuffs and I wore the other.<br />
<br />
For some reason, I felt like I’m melting. Teddy looked at me. His eyes were wide. That is when I noticed that it wasn’t just a feeling. I saw Henry melt in front of me, then I followed. Everything went white and I couldn’t see, speak nor hear anything, but I can feel. I felt like I’m being moved against something liquid as well. That is when I began to lose consciousness. I began to forgot something— no. Everything...<br />
<br />
What’s happening?<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Where am I? Who am I?… I questioned myself. I couldn’t remember anything… no… everything. I couldn’t even open my eyes as if there’s something preventing me from doing so. I began feeling my body. It felt so foreign and familiar at the same time. As time flies by, I came to the point where my body was moving on its own and I can’t control myself. My hand then moved down and grabben onto my hand cock while the other pinched my nipple. I moaned in a deep voice and it felt like it wasn’t mine as well. I leaned back onto a wall and I couldn’t stop myself from storking my cock. The hand who was pinching my nipple migrated to my abs, feeling each and every pack, then moving up again to meet my head and held my hair back. My moans are getting louder and louder. All I can think of now is to release… To cum… I began thrusting between my palm and fingers. My other hand was now helping the other to stroke my cock.<br />
<br />
Finally, I came a huge load. I can finally remember and open my eyes. I’m Carter Robles. A 32 year old boxing coach. I came to this shop to buy these gloves. I saw the mess that I made on the floor and on my body. I even came on the gloves too! I haven’t even paid for it!<br />
<br />
Why was I masturbating though… Nevermind. I need to clean up. I wiped the cum off my body, on the floor and on the gloves with my shirt (which I decided to not wear since it&#39;s wet with my cum), I grabbed my underwear and my shorts and wore them, then walked out the dressing room.<br />
<br />
“Uhm. Excuse me.” I furrowed my eyebrows. “How much were these gloves again?” I asked the only staff sitting on the counter.<br />
<br />
He replied with a chuckle then placed both of his hands onto my shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Jack. Teddy. Remember who you really are.” He repeated it multiple times.<br />
<br />
I stared at him confused but there’s something in his voice that makes me feel… W-Wait… Holy…<br />
<br />
“…Shit, Teddy.”<br />
<br />
“Jack, I’m here-”<br />
<br />
“Where!?”<br />
<br />
“I’m…”<br />
<br />
Teddy and I them came to a realisation that…<br />
<br />
“We’re in the same body…” We both said in unison.<br />
<br />
The man walked away from us and laughed.<br />
<br />
“You guys will finally be able to enjoy the summer! Maybe not even just this summer…” He said.<br />
<br />
“You are now this man. This adult. Seems like no more school for you two. You can stay as this man up until… Whenever you want. If you want to go back to your own selves, just remove one of the cuffs.” He pointed at the cuffs on my…erm… our left wrist. Both of the cuffs were now on the same place.<br />
<br />
We looked back at the man.<br />
<br />
“Teddy” Teddy stated his name and raised our hand. “How much is this? We’ll keep it.”<br />
<br />
Yet again, he reacted with a chuckle. “It’s all yours. No need to pay.”<br />
<br />
He walked near us again and placed both of his hands back onto our shoulders. “Just if you have any questions about this cuffs. You can always see this shop anywhere.”<br />
<br />
“What if our parents see us transform?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry. Reality changes when you two fuse and unfuse.” He smiled at us.<br />
<br />
I noticed a wallet in my shorts. I grabbed it and checked it out. There was an ID in it with Carters&#39;s name. There were also money and other cards that belongs to him. I also realized that our clothes went missing and were suddenly replaced by Carter&#39;s clothes. I guess reality did change.<br />
<br />
“I see. Thank you.”<br />
<br />
“Right now, so you can enjoy this body more, I want you two to think of who this man is. Who are you two when you merge.”<br />
<br />
We did what we were told. In no time, once again….<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
I can feel myself again… Carter Robles … Though I know I’m Teddy and Jack too, I have my own life too and I can remember it all. I can only remember Teddy and Jack’s memories once I think too deep into them.<br />
<br />
I payed for the gloves, thanked the man, and walked out the store. I should go back to my room and explore more! This seems fun!</p>
