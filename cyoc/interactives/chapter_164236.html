<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joey looked at the two six-inch women. Melissa had given him a blank check and had enjoyed everything done so far, and Colleen had followed suit. He knew magic had to be involved in their state of being, more than just their change, otherwise they&#39;d have frozen to death by now or lost all ability to reason with such tiny brains. Or maybe the transformation had ways to tweak around that, either way it was fascinating. <br />
<br />
They&#39;d made jokes about being dolls before ... and if the magic could do this, then there was no reason it couldn&#39;t take things further. He&#39;d already seen with his wish that the ring had few if any practical limits, and the woman had said she wanted to see him &#39;shake things up&#39; not caring if he was naughty or nice about it, basically giving him a blank check. <br />
<br />
&#39;I wish the two of you were sapient dolls.&#39; Joey thought.  <br />
<br />
Colleen and Melissa let out gasps as they felt the magic wash over them... they also saw their bodies instantly become nice and clean. Next, their skin took on a plastic sheen, losing any hair of blemishes besides their heads. Their toes fused together, as they felt their bodies become hollow, their fingers except for their thumbs fused together next, join lines appeared on their shoulder and hips... Their nipples vanishes, along with anything between their legs and rears as they completely sealed up. Their hips widened and their breasts expanded, becoming an idealized woman&#39;s figure, their measurements became identical. Their eyes became painted on, but they could still see just fine. In fact, they found they could still move just fine. Their faces morphed, becoming those of a fashion model. <br />
<br />
Melissa looked at herself and touched hers breasts, not feeling anything different than touching her arms. Any sexual drive she might have been feeling a moment ago simply gone... But she didn&#39;t feel alarmed... if anything, it felt... right, and the more she thought about it, the more she found it hard to think of that rightness itself as odd. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, whao!&quot; Melissa gasped.<br />
s<br />
&quot;This is, totally ... something, but I guess I should have seen it coming with how you&#39;ve been encouraging him!&quot; &#39;Did I just say &#39;totally&#39;?&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;We could totally be twins!&quot; Melissa said excitedly looking at herself and Colleen. <br />
<br />
Joey, oblivious to the secondary effect of his wish, remembered how Melissa was a submissive, and this gave him a chance to give her that experience on a level never seen before. <br />
<br />
&#39;I wish for what I say next to be accepted as true,&#39; Joey thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you&#39;re so excited, you&#39;re just dolls after all, toys, objects to owned and played with.&quot; <br />
<br />
And a ripple went through Colleen and Melissa, yes, that was right, they WERE just dolls, toys to belong to someone. <br />
<br />
Joey felt a ripple go through himself as well... he realized what he said was true, they were just dolls after all, playthings. <br />
<br />
The two dolls stood at attention and laughed, &quot;Yes Joey, we are your dolls!&quot;<br />
<br />
At the same time, two toy cardboard display boxes appeared on a shelf. One with happy ghosts and cartoon bats, with the words, Spooky Melissa at the top. The other have covered in brightly colored pixel art of arcade classics with the words &#39;Gamer Colleen&#39; with instructions on how to wirelessly connect her to the gaming platform of your choice. <br />
<br />
At the same time, dots appeared in the dolls bellies, as tiny speakers formed inside them, along with a micro-sized wireless support inside Gaming Colleen, she was the perfect player-two for any occasion, being it fighting games, FPS, or tennis! Melissa now had over a hundred spooky noises and sounds she could replay. <br />
<br />
Their voices no longer coming from their mouths but their speaker in their bellies, the two dolls bowed. &quot;What can we do for you today Player-One/Joey?&quot; The two almost echoed.<br />
<br />
Joey looked down at his two living dolls and said, &quot;I think we&#39;ve had a lot of fun with you two today, more than usual, but I think we can do a lot more than just us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A new game to play!&quot; Colleen clapped.<br />
<br />
Joey thought out loud, &quot;Hmmm... but it would look rather awkward if I was seen with a pair of dolls around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey knew he could just wish it not to be odd, but he wanted to go for something more elaborate. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was a little girl who doesn&#39;t look suspicious at all with her little living dolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And for Joey, it was the world that got bigger, he got smaller and smaller, high school, middle school, then early grade school, as he shrank his clothes changed, becoming bright and colorful, his pants and shirt morphing into a frilly dress. Meanwhile, he became she, but as the changes happened, he was already reversed passed the point of puberty making it much harder to tell such things apart. Her hair grew long and curly as her face softened. <br />
<br />
The new little girl looked at herself. <br />
&quot;Yippie!&quot; She sang in a high-pitch cutesy voice, &quot;I&#39;m sooo cute!&quot; New (old?) childish impulses flooded her brain as she looked around at the apartment. She pouted. &quot;This place is boring! I wish it was just the kinda place for a girl like me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Immediately the apartment changed. The place&#39;s primary colors became pink and white, with stuffed animals and a tea set visible along with a fridge and bed and other things all made to her size. The dolls clapped at their owner&#39;s feat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... Joey isn&#39;t a girlie name, okay, I wish my name was Josie!&quot; Josie said causally. Some part of her dimly recognized that a little girl being all by herself was suspicious onto itself and she&#39;d get in trouble. &quot;I wish that... me having my own place like this was totally taken care of, and nobody would think it was weird!&quot; And a ripple went out, and the apartment was now Josie&#39;s property as much as her dolls were and none questioned it, and a trust fund made sure she didn&#39;t have to worry about little details like rent and utility bills or groceries. <br />
<br />
Picking up a purse covered in pretty sparkles, Josie said, &quot;Come along dollies! We&#39;re gonna have so much fun with my magic ring!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes owner!&quot; The little dolls cheered, taking a minute to put on a pretty purple and black dress, and a dress with a retro-80s color pattern. <br />
<br />
Exiting her apartment, Josie skipped along, bumping into one of the older residents. And thought how cleaning her own room would be boring. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you were my cute little bunny plushie maid, who loved to clean my room, and nobody found it weird!&quot; <br />
<br />
The old woman stood in confusion for only a moment as she shrank down to Josie&#39;s size, her body covered in patches of black and white fur, her insides filling with fluff, but remaining alive and animate all the same. Her shoes and socks vanished, while her old dress turned into a maid&#39;s uniform that may or may not have been part of her body. Her hands and feet because paws, she she was able to hold the duster that appeared in her paws without trouble. Her ears moved to the top of her head growing longer as a big cotton tail appeared from her rear. Her eyes became big, blue and plastic, she blinked as her nose grew into a muzzle with a little pink velvet tip with plastic whiskers and buck teeth. The little rabbit maid bowed. &quot;Have a good day out Lady Josephine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just call me Josie Ella!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Lady Josie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie just giggled, the rabbit maid using her own key to get inside the apartment and cleaning it for her mistress. <br />
<br />
Josie next finally came outside, and saw a homeless man. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you were a big plushie polar bear ice cream salesman and that was normal!&quot; <br />
<br />
And the homeless man dirty clothes vanished, and his body became huge as a it was covered in white, no longer having anything to show than the average teddy bear, his only clothing being a red bowtie around his neck. His cardboard &#39;need food&#39; sign becoming a &#39;ice cream for sale!&#39; His form looking like a gigantic white teddy bear, as a ice cream stand appeared in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Lady Josie! Want some ice cream?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES YES YES YES!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; The giant plush bear said, giving his little mistress an ice cream cone that she consumed on the spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Willy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome my lady!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie skipped down the street, not a care in the world, until she bumped into a teenage girl in a drape school uniform. &quot;And just hit send and that little punk will regret ever saying no to- HEY! Watch it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Hi! I wish you were my deerie plus playmate and we can have fun all day without any trouble!&quot; <br />
<br />
The teenager was about to tell Josie off as she shrunk down to the size of the master of the ring... Her body became covered in light brown fur with white dots covering her back, her feet becoming plastic hooves, while her fingers did the same but were separated into three parts for manipulation. Her face pushed out into a deer&#39;s muzzle as her ears grew flat and long on the sides her head, a tiny tuff of a tail growing from her rear. Her body filled with cotton, her eyes became plastic, and she sealed up from the neck down, with nothing but smooth cloth. Her uniform vanished, all her clothing replaced with a single blue bow around one ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Josie! Wanna play today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet Chiara!&quot; <br />
<br />
The took two each other&#39;s hand and practically pranced to the park. Josie wishing away a cloudy day while she was at it.</p>
