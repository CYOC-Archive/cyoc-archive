<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Geez this family is a car wreck,&quot; Ethan whispered. <br />
<br />
That certainly appeared to be the case, at least from what Ethan could determine. Chris was a 38 year old single father, dating a much younger woman as his 13 year old son was kept to his own devices with his 13 year old girlfriend. Gazing at the quartets, Ethan wondered if their was anything he could do.<br />
<br />
Looking at everyone&#39;s stats, Ethan could see Chris&#39;s age listed as 38 years s 6 months while Lola was 26 years 3 months. &quot;What is it with the adults on this family dating younger women,&quot; he thought. For a moment, Ethan lingered on the exchange button, giving Chris&#39;s years to Jerry and Alyssa seemed like an easy enough solution, why not make them the same age as Lola.<br />
<br />
That idea was quickly thrown out by Ethan. It would 24 years to make both Alyssa and Jerry Lola&#39;s age, leaving Chris at only 14 years old. &quot;Then it would be Jerry in charge again,&quot; Ethan sighed. &quot;And we&#39;ve seen what an ass he can be.&quot; As he now rubbed his chin thoughtfully an idea came to him. Why couldn&#39;t he take years from both Lola and Chris?<br />
<br />
Ethan now began to work out the math. If he were to make Jerry and Alyssa say 21 years old, he would need 16 years. Ethan could simply use the program to take 14 years from Chris and 2 from Lola. This way the adults would be 24 with two 21 year olds having crashed at the apartment. &quot;Its at least save Jerry the embarrassment of being caught naked by his dad.&quot; Shrugging his shoulders, Ethan now activated the exchange.<br />
<br />
The loss and gain of years between Jerry and Chris were quite obvious, especially for Jerry. The young, skinny, teen immediately began to grow taller. At 16 Jerry&#39;s body began to fill out once more, his muscles beginning tobtake on a lean shape as he rocketed through high school. As he closed in on 18, Ethan could see a lanky if not fit teen ready for graduation.<br />
<br />
Passing into his college years, Ethan observed Jerry begin to become bulkier. While the boys height had shot up, putting him at eye level with Chris, he had remained rather thin in comparison to the stickier Chris. Now that weight difference began to change. <br />
<br />
Jerry&#39;s hard earned gains from college began to return. Ethan watching as the young man&#39;s pecs began to swell, regaining definition as he grew older. Jerry&#39;s arms also now grew wider, his biceps and triceps doubling in size from the skinny teenager he had been only moments before. As Jerry closed in on his target age of 21, Ethan could see a rather handsome young man, his face losing its boyish properties as the roundness angled off. Jerry was now a young man ready to graduate college, his mop of blonde hair thick yet well kept.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39;s changes were just as interesting.  Traveling backwards through his 30s, Ethan watched as the grey on his short blonde hair began to fade. Although fully clothed, Ethan could tell that the man was slimming, his body appearing to firm up. By the time he became 30, Chris appeared much more refreshed, his face angular, mature, and unlined.<br />
<br />
Descending into his 20s, Chris&#39;s changes continued. The man&#39;s body continuing to firm and slim. Although Chris wasn&#39;t as large as Jerry had been, he was still a rather large man. Ethan watched as Chris&#39;s pecs now pushed out his shirt, his bicep bulging in his shirt sleeves. Settling at an age of 24 years and 6 months, Ethan nodded in approval. Chris was a handsome, fit young professional. Possessing a muscular body, healthy blonde hair, and a youthful yet stern face, he gave off the impression of a responsible young man just starting his career. Frowning at Jerry, Chris now gave the younger man a reproachful look.<br />
<br />
&quot;What hell Jerry,&quot; Chris sighed. &quot;Why you gotta bring your girlfriend back to my apartment? I mean, I pay for your housing at college for a reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah cmon bro,&quot; Jerry groaned. &quot;We were looking for a quiet place to go. There was a huge party and people everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they&#39;re brothers now,&quot; Ethan stated in awe. &quot;And it looks like big brother isn&#39;t too thrilled with little brother useing his apartment as a love nest.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jerry and Chris talked, Ethan glanced over at Lola. The woman, despite losing two years, seemed relatively unchanged. Ethan thinking that perhaps her face looked a little fresher. Right now she was knocking on the door, asking Alyssa&#39;s is she was okay. Asb he door opened, Ethan was surprised by what he saw.<br />
<br />
Alyssa was an adult again. Gone was the waifish young teen only taking her first steps into puberty. Instead, Ethan beheld a bombshell of a red head. Firm massive breasts, flawless alabaster skin, ample curves, Alyssa was an absolute knockout just as she had been before Ethans changes. The only thing he could note now was the youthfulness of her face. Alyssa&#39;s fave was only beginning to take on a more mature appearance, her eyes still wide and innocent as she sheepishly stepped out of the bathroom half dressed. &quot;Sorry Chris,&quot; she stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not mad at you Alyssa,&quot; Chris sighed. &quot;I know my idiot little brother probably told you it was cool you two crashing here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m not an idiot,&quot; Jerry whined in typical little brother fashion. As Chris was about to respond it was Lola who stepped forward to ease the tension.  &quot;C&#39;mon Chris go easy on him,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean don&#39;t you remember our wild nights in college?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Chris groaned. &quot;Why do you think I get on his ass? I don&#39;t want him to make the same mistake I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww you do care big brother,&quot; Jerry grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just put some pants on dumbass,&quot; Chris grunted, tossing a pair of boxers at Jerry. &quot;Lola and I are gonna find something to watch and the last thing I want is to see your junk. When your dressed you and Alyssa can join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Chris,&quot; Jerry smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah sure,&quot; Chris sighed. &quot;Just stop breaking into my place to hook up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan leaned back in his chair, watching the scene play out. Chris and Jerry were siblings now, Jerry the wild little brother with Chris being the understanding yet firm big brother. It was a vast improvement over the previous dynamic, Ethan wondering if he should continue to alter with quartet.</p>
