<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Most of this story is what ShrunkenAdam wrote but at the part where they start to meet other people, I wanted to go a different direction. So the five stars &quot;*****&quot; marks the place where ShrunkenAdam&#39;s writing ends and my writing begins.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Measuring Wyatt further reveals his perfect proportions<br />
<br />
Moth and the other boys are fascinated by how well-proportioned Wyatt is. “Well okay guys, I can understand you are curious about my body, it’s not like I seem to have many options, right?”<br />
<br />
Making the tiny teen stand up, Moth makes him lift his arms horizontally. “I want to measure your pecs”, He says with a weird smile. So using a measuring tape he founds out it was 7-3/4 inches. Wyatt is not really comfortable being measured like that, but part of him enjoys being the centre of attraction even if it feels very weird.<br />
<br />
Chris seems very attentive to all details, odd for a guy who is homophobic and still fascinated by the shrunken teen anatomy. So he said. “What about his leg&#39;s length?” Moth makes him slightly spread his legs, which he does. But he got surprised and blushed when the giant teen had to put one edge of the measuring tape under his testicles to then extend the tape along his tiny leg. “5-1/4 inches.<br />
<br />
“What about his penis?” Giggles John<br />
<br />
“Soft or hard?” Mick said aloud, mockingly.<br />
<br />
“Hey stop it right now guys! What is that interest about my genitals?” Yells Wyatt very irritated.<br />
<br />
Mike is probably the less morally grounded guy in the group, even though that sort of power they all have over their shrunken play pal began to give him a semi-erection, which is not visible at that point.<br />
<br />
“Common tiny Wyatt, it’s just a game, no one will know besides us”, Mike said as, without any permission, put his index finger under the tiny penis to lift it horizontally the then measure it. “Not too bad, it’s 3/4 inch” But without very much shyness, he pinches it between his fingertip and thumb to milk it.<br />
<br />
Wyatt, very upset, tries to punch those invasive fingers away, even hitting them with his tiny fist. But Mike crabs the tiny man in his left fist and holds him firmly to have free access to the tiny genital he is masturbating.<br />
<br />
“Will you let him go on Chris? I thought you hate all those gay things!”, He said very angry and almost about to cry.<br />
<br />
Then Mike stops molesting Wyatt when he sees Chris’ disapproval look and said: “Hey look, he has an erection now, take your measurement and stop being sadistic.”<br />
<br />
Moth passes the measuring tape to Mike who dropped it when he began to sexually abuse Wyatt. The tiny guy was kicking and yelling insults, but his uncut and thick erected dick was a good 1-1/4 inch long.<br />
<br />
“What now, no one had bet money on my dick size too? You say we are friends and all you did so far is humiliate me and have fun with me even if I&#39;m not willing, how can you? I want to grow back and have my clothes! I have an erection, so what! Are you happy now you bunch of perverts!”<br />
<br />
John is feeling very bad and said: “I think, guys, we went way too far with him.” Then he gives the tiny man one of his clothes, red athleticism shorts actually. Wyatt is not sure what to think about it, it could be another trick or something. But he takes it and covers his nudity.<br />
<br />
“We sure got carried away with the intoxication of having a tiny guy to play with.”, Said Chris. But he does not understand what was happening in their minds and why no one seem to be able to resist touching the tiny teen. From his part, Wyatt began to come back to a more logical state of mind, analyzing his new situation. So he said:<br />
<br />
“Listen up guys, it’s not being touched I hate the most, it’s that you do it without my consent, which is totally wrong. You want to have fun, right, we can do it, but don’t you think it will be better to do it as I’m willing?”<br />
<br />
All the other boy agrees and Moth is the first to apologize, followed by John, Mike, and finally Chris.<br />
<br />
“What about we meet up with other normal sizes gays and shrunken men poolside, if it’s okay with you Wyatt”, said Chris.<br />
<br />
“Sounds fine with me, will you carry me Chris?” Said with a little shy tone<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, Wyatt has some kind of attraction for Chris, so in his mind, it’s the best occasion for being touched by him. Inside himself, he giggled thinking that a homophobic man could hold him in his fist, touching him. So without thinking further, Chris picked up the tiny man who loved the sensation of the warm and soft skin on his tiny body. It was like receiving a very long and comforting hug.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
The boys left to see what kind of fun places they could find. They found a bar that also had snacks and non-alcoholic drinks but what really made it interesting was how there were accommodations for tinies. The boys sat at the bar and place Wyatt on the bar. Wyatt only had to walk a short distance to sit at the tiny bar on top of the regular sized bar. There were a few other tinies there, most of them naked like Wyatt.<br />
<br />
A tiny waiter worked the bar serving the other tinies. The waiter was stark naked.<br />
<br />
Chris asked, &quot;Why are you naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter said, &quot;It&#39;s just tradition that tinies don&#39;t wear clothes. It&#39;s not a rule but it&#39;s expected that giants should have access to the entire bodies of all tinies.&quot;<br />
<br />
John asked, &quot;So I can take you and have fun with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter said, &quot;I&#39;m working right now. You can look and you can touch but if you prevent me from doing my job, you&#39;ll get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
John started feeling the waiter&#39;s tiny body. &quot;Do you like your job?&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter said, &quot;It&#39;s not the worst job in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moth and John decided to compare the waiter to Wyatt and they bet on who was biggest. So standing side by side, Wyatt and the waiter allowed their dicks to be measured and the waiter won.<br />
<br />
One of the other giants at the bar said, &quot;Alright, now winner fucks loser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt and his friends were stunned. Chris said, &quot;But Wyatt isn&#39;t gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy said, &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter. He&#39;s a tiny. He lost. It&#39;s tradition.&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris complained, &quot;Are there other traditions we need to watch out for?&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter said, &quot;Oh yes, there are a whole bunch of traditions regarding tiny/giant interactions. They are not rules but you are expected to play with tinies in certain ways such as keeping your tiny in your underwear next to your cock, cleaning your tinies asshole by inserting a cotton swab, having your tiny stick parts of himself down your piss slit. You&#39;re not required to do any of these but people will wonder why you&#39;re here if you don&#39;t do some activities with your tinies?&quot;<br />
<br />
The waiter finished lubing Wyatt&#39;s ass and stuck his dick in. Wyatt was overwhelmed with a mixture of pleasure and discomfort. Somehow though, it made him feel good to know he was taking dick like a champ. Wyatt asked, &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tristan Martin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt said, &quot;Good, I want to remember the name of the person who first came inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris asked, &quot;Wyatt, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt wondered how he should answer. He worried that if Chris thought he was gay that Chris would abandon him.</p>
