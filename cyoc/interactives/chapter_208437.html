<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The seven friends entered their haunted house attraction wary of just what they would find or who could have hurt Ms. McKinnon. As they got further in, they were all getting a little nervous despite putting on a brave face. However things would get worse before they got better for the teens as they would all be caught up in their worst fears.<br />
<br />
Connor was holding Spark&#39;s hand as they were walking when Connor felt Spark stop behind him. Connor turned around to see Spark standing with her back turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark? What is it? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Connor asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong? Oh, nothing&#39;s wrong Connor. Except maybe I&#39;ve been thinking that maybe we should just end this.&quot; Spark said barely turning her head to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-W-What? what do you mean end this? We&#39;ve got to find this thing.&quot; Connor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mean that, I mean us. You and me. Did you really think that what we&#39;ve had has been love? Please, I&#39;ve just pitied you more than anything. All those kisses, those sweet talks, and that dance? That especially meant nothing to me.&quot; Spark said as she turned her head to Connor and he felt like knives were being put in his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor Moreland, you are nothing to me.&quot; Spark said as she turned and left him standing there crying.<br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
Spark was walking ahead, she had sworn she was just holding Connor&#39;s hand when he let go and wandered on ahead. She turned the corner to see Connor lying on the floor lifeless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor! Oh my god, please, please no! Connor please wake up. Don&#39;t die, don&#39;t leave me.&quot; Spark begged holding back her tears. From behind her, she heard footsteps and turned to see Jacob and Nina there behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark, how could you have let this happen?&quot; Jacob asked sounding ashamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...didn&#39;t want this to happen, we were supposed to be protecting each other.&quot; Spark tried to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you killed my son, how can I trust you with my son or daughter now. I regret ever giving her your name for a middle name.&quot; Nina said as they pushed her aside to be by Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...would never let this happen. I love you all....I love him. Connor....&quot; Spark said beginning to cry.<br />
<br />
*************************<br />
<br />
Rei looked around and was confused, she had somehow found her way back outside to see her mother and father with suitcases.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Dad? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Rei asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re moving Rei, we&#39;ve got to go back to Russia. Our neighbors don&#39;t want us here.&quot; Rei&#39;s father, Thomas said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? But...but poppa my friends are here, our neighbors haven&#39;t caused us any harm.&quot; Rei tried to plead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my little Rei. They were lying to us this whole time. They just can&#39;t accept a Russian and Japanese family on their street.&quot; Hanako said putting a hand on her daughter&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can...can I say goodbye to Nat?&quot; Rei asked trying not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat? Oh honey, don&#39;t you remember? You two had a big fight and broke up, she didn&#39;t even want to come here.&quot; Hanako said to Rei as she started to cry in front of her house.<br />
<br />
***************************************<br />
<br />
Nat was running for her life out of breath. She didn&#39;t understand it, one moment she had been in the school with her friends, the next moment, she had lost them and ran out of the haunted house attraction to find them only to be met with a mob of students after her somehow aware that she was a damphir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me alone! I&#39;m not evil, I&#39;m just a teenage girl!&quot; Nat shouted at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a teenage nightmare! How do we know you won&#39;t just try and kill us during the day when we least suspect it?!&quot; Someone shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I don&#39;t drink human blood, and the thought of killing someone just makes me sick.&quot; Nat pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t do any good to argue, we already have your parents.&quot; Someone from the crowd said as her parents were brought before her tied and gagged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just surrender and we won&#39;t hurt them.&quot; Another voice said.<br />
<br />
Nat was confused as to what to do now. She didn&#39;t see Rei or any of her friends, her parents were nodding to her to go along with the crowd but she felt so conflicted.<br />
<br />
********************************<br />
<br />
Miranda was going along in the attraction when she suddenly felt a hand on her shoulder and turned around to see her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamá? What are you doing here?&quot; Miranda asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t give me that tone Miranda. How long were you going to hide this from me?&quot; Gabrielle asked her daughter with a stern face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean mamá?&quot; Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your...sexuality? Miranda, you can&#39;t imagine how ashamed I feel. Your father and I didn&#39;t raise you like this. It&#39;s almost enough to make me disown you.&quot; Gabrielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, mamá....you can&#39;t....!&quot; Miranda tried to argue before slapped on the face by her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not my daughter anymore.&quot; Gabrielle said with a serious face.<br />
<br />
&quot;My....my mamá would never hit me. I came out to her a week ago. It was difficult for her at first, but she still loves me as her daughter just like my father. YOU&#39;RE NOT MY MAMÁ!&quot; Miranda shouted throwing her wrists up into the air and transforming into her magical girl outfit.<br />
<br />
Miranda suddenly became aware that her brother and the rest of her friends were all in a daze like she must have been. She decided to try and wake up Amara first. She touched a hand on her shoulder and Miranda saw into Amara&#39;s own deepest fears.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t....they don&#39;t want me....just like nobody wanted me.&quot; Amara said crying as she sat down with her arms around her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amara? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go away Miranda, you don&#39;t really want me here, nobody does. Nat doesn&#39;t, Spark especially doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s just back on the streets again for me.&quot; Amara said with a sad sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;The streets? Amara, were you homeless before Nat took you in as a cat?&quot; Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most mara are. Whoever my mother was, she just gave birth to me and threw me out into the streets. Now just leave me alone, you said you wanted to anyway.&quot; Amara said dejectedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amara, look at me, I&#39;m real. None of what you&#39;ve just seen is real. We&#39;re all facing our worst fears against some kind of nightmare demon that&#39;s a lot worse than what we thought you were.&quot; Miranda explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m still an awful person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re not. Amara, I&#39;ve only known you for so many days now, but I know that you were just lonely. You wanted a family, friends, someone to love, and you have it with me. I love you Amara.&quot; Miranda said as she pressed her lips against Amara&#39;s breaking her out of her trance and bringing her back into the real world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda, oh my god it really is you. You love me...and yes....I do love you.&quot; Amara said with happy tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but now we&#39;ve got to save the others. They&#39;re all experiencing their worst nightmares.&quot; Miranda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re not going in there alone, I know how to break them out of their nightmares and I&#39;ll definitely need your help.&quot; Amara said holding Miranda&#39;s hand.</p>
