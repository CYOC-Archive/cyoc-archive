<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... a strange bodysuit costume called, a zentai/morphsuit. He&#39;s been seeing those costumes on the Internet, but never owned one as it became a thing lately and wondered how it&#39;d feels being worn as a spandex costume from head to toe and arouse his wearer and himself as well. As a twist, he liked the version with mittens and/or D-rings in the tips of the mittens or socks of the suit since he has gets a little aroused into those bdsm equipment. He wanted to stay as a zentai suit for at least a week or two. Matt went to the options menu for his transformation and wanted to be aware of what is around him and clicked the &quot;aware&quot; selection box. He also clicked two things in the random transport boxes to be sold at a costume store waiting be bought and worn or at a friend&#39;s house for a week or two. He then wrote down a description of what kind of zentai/morphsuit Matt should be. Matt wanted a generic morphsuit with just a zipper on the back, no facial features, socks for feet, and gloved hands, but instead of having fingers on both hands, he switched it with mittens with a thumb and added D-rings on the tip of the hands and feet; he also like the color green but soon realized there were different colors or patterns for a morphsuit and looked up the zentai store sites on the Internet and went for a checkered pattern for his choice and made his size to medium or large. There was also an inanimate delay timer option added a delay for a few minutes for him to be animate to inanimate object for at least five to thirty minutes to get a good long feeling of touching and walking/running around as a living zentai for a short period of time. He saved his choice template should he want to be a zentai/morphsuit again or for a friend of his. He also reminded him to click the alternate world so it wouldn&#39;t cause a problem for his family or friends to think he went missing. With everything checked he initiated the transformation and went in front of his full body mirror in his bedroom. He wanted to watch his transformation slow but not too slow and started recording with his camera set up to his left to show his front from the mirror just before he initiated the transformation process.<br />
<br />
About forty seconds passed and nothing happened to Matt yet. Until he felt a tingling feeling from the top of his head as at started heading down to the middle behind his head and all the way down to the top of his bottom. Matt placed his fingers on top of his head and felt strange metallic teeth running along the strange line from his head to lower back up and down and finally stopped at the nape of his neck to feel two small zipper handles and feels like they&#39;re apart of him which sends chills of pleasure and smiled. The next thing he felt was his hair retreating to his head including his body hair as they too retreated into his body and looked down to see his belly button to vanish and his chest become bare and featureless and then his malehood melted into his crotch being smooth but with the inanimate timer delay, he got aroused and watched his smooth crotch bulge out slowly and rubbed it as it became more sensitive and began to moan with a aroused pleasured smile on his face. Then, a small patch of of black and white squares appeared on his left arm and went from flesh to spandex feeling as it spread all over slowly on his body and appear in some parts of Matt&#39;s body. He then feels his whole body become sensitive as they progress to become spandex for his skin and can feel the slightest breeze in his room even though the window wasn&#39;t open or any wind powered device was turned on. He then wriggled his toes and mushing them together and looked down to see his toes slowly fuse together and became a single digit on both feet as they wriggled in unison then rubbed his spandex sock like feet to the floor as it felt so good to him. The same thing happened to his hands as Matt rubbed his fingers mashing them together as they slowly merged into one excluding his thumbs like his feet. Matt then felt a sudden feeling inside of him as he can feel his insides being absorbed into his body or disappearing which he didn&#39;t care since the transformation progress made him aroused to think straight. He then felt a strange tug at the tip of his mitten hands and socked feet as he moans even more and squirming his hands and feet in fast movements as he watched stretchable spandex straps that ends with a metallic rings pulls and form as it became apart of Matt&#39;s body as it flails around with his feet and hands as the rings hitting his hands and feet and also clattering the floor. As the last of his flesh colored skin was turned into checkered pattern and his butt cracked sealed, the only thing left human was his face as it slowly takes him. He feels his ears sinking into his head with no holes to be found and felt his mouth and nose to seal up as he (somewhat) still looks at himself in pleasure and still stroking his whole body and still moans in a muffled tone as Matt&#39;s mouth seals and vanishes followed by his nose which is now just a bump as his human skin around his face slowly turned into spandex followed by appearing checkered black and white squares replacing his human skin color which was the last thing Matt sees when his sight was gone for a short moment and his sight returned to him and what was staring back at him was a neutral gendered being with ring straps that ends on his hands and feet with no face with checkered spandex skin. He can feel the rings on his hands add a little weight as they weigh down as he relaxes his arms and watch the rings sways and calms for a few second<br />
<br />
He can&#39;t make any facial features to show his smiling face, but he was aroused and happy how it came out and liked it. Matt started walking around and started to moan muffled as he walked first feeling his spandex legs rubbing together which puts him a semi aroused state and feels his rings flying around or sliding across the floor and feels them being stepped on by his feet and liked the slight gentle breeze touching him (like tiny little hands) and stroking himself also touching other objects for at least five to thirty minutes. He looked at the chronivac and noticed his animate to inanimate delay timer set to five to thirty minutes counting down and rethinks his idea of being an inanimate suit. He still has a chance to make a second chance adjustments. Instead of being an inanimate suit and cancel the alternate universe transportation sequence, why can&#39;t he just be a living zentai doll that can still make moaning noises though muffled and have a friend to play with his stretchy body, and he has a friend that he knows that also like spandex things like this, in fact, he also realizes that his friend likes zentai that he forgot. The thought of making it permanent is also a thing since he likes the arousal of his new skin and can also turn his friend into a living, moaning zentai suit or doll like him with the chronivac. Or just let it be. He swings the D-ring strap on his right mitten hand around as he thinks about his new choices.</p>
