<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tyler moved through the lecture hall, he could feel his dick getting harder, throbbing against his muscular torso, the tip wedged between his pecs. Even through the haze of the morphine, he could feel the ache in his balls. The closer he got to his target, the more his dick trembled, and the more his balls screamed at him for relief. And then he was at the end of the row, looking down at his &quot;one.&quot; Shock drained the color from Tyler&#39;s face. There, staring up at him with wide eyes, was a dude. <br />
<br />
There was a long, awkward pause as Tyler stared down at the other male. He was handsome and well-built, his tee shirt showing off his strong chest, shoulders, and arms. Distantly, Tyler thought he had seen the guy running around with the rugby team. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go,&quot; Tyler croaked out at last, staring so intently that the other man could feel the heat of the gaze upon him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I have chem lecture...&quot; the other man replied, unable to think of anything else to say. Everyone on campus knew about &quot;the Bull,&quot; after all. But Hank had never seen him this close, and certainly never spoken to him. And while everyone on campus talked about the Bull&#39;s giant bulge, this was the first time anyone had seen it hard! <br />
<br />
Even Hank&#39;s voice drove Tyler wild. It was rich and sexy and made his dick leak so much pre that it was making a spot on his shirt. &quot;I need you. Now.&quot; Tyler growled, his voice insistent, demanding. &quot;Grab your stuff. We&#39;re going.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hank stared for a moment. Then he quickly grabbed his things. The Bull looked almost crazed, and Hank had seen the hulking football player in the gym enough times to know that the big man was even stronger than he looked! Clearly, going along with the Bull&#39;s demand was the only realistic option. <br />
<br />
Seeing the smaller man comply, Tyler stood aside, then followed his &quot;one&quot; out of the lecture hall as the entire room stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what do you want? And where are we going?&quot; Hank asked, heading down the hallway outside the large room. <br />
<br />
&quot;You. I want you!&quot; Tyler growled in response. He put a big hand on Hank&#39;s shoulder and guided him down an empty hallway. The football player was breathing heavily, his cock and balls screaming at him to secure relief, and soon! &quot;In here!&quot; Tyler rumbled, pulling Hank into a small, empty lab room. He locked the door behind them, then began to immediately strip off his clothes. <br />
<br />
Hank backed away from Tyler, his eyes wide, watching the huge man strip off his clothes. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked, his voice a hushed whisper. He nearly choked on his own tongue when he saw Tyler&#39;s giant cock fully unveiled, looking like something that <br />
<br />
&quot;I NEED YOU!&quot; Tyler thundered, walking over toward his intended conquest. Between his pent up sexual need, his lust from being in the presence of his one, and the fog of the morphine, he could no longer think straight. He pushed Hank against a counter and began to pull off his clothes, stripping him down one article at a time, slowly revealing his partner&#39;s athletic body. The more he saw, the more aroused Tyler became, his dick leaking a steady stream of pre as he admired Hank&#39;s hunky form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now just a minute...&quot; Hank protested, trying to push Tyler back. It was like trying to push a mountain. No, a Bull. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that Hank didn&#39;t want Tyler. He was gay and he loved fit, muscular dudes, which was why he had started playing rugby, even before he got to college. He&#39;d ogled Tyler more than once in the gym, marveling at the Bull&#39;s incredible size and strength. But everything was moving fast--too fast. &quot;Just stop!&quot; Hank finally shouted. <br />
<br />
Tyler stopped. He took two wobbly steps back, then fell to his knees. &quot;Please...&quot; Tyler begged in his deep voice, &quot;I&#39;ve been cursed! I was given this crazy dick... and I can only cum with &#39;the one&#39;! I haven&#39;t cum in over a month! My balls hurt so much!&quot; <br />
<br />
Hank felt a pang of sympathy. To see the Bull reduced to begging on his knees... clearly the big man was desperate. He went to his knees as well and reached out to grip Tyler&#39;s big cock. He saw and felt the shudder that ran through the hulking football player. &quot;Okay,&quot; Hank said softly, &quot;I&#39;ll help you out. But then we have to have a talk about all of this.&quot; Tyler nodded eagerly. Whatever it took. He would agree to whatever was required--any cost was worth it, if it finally gave his tormented nuts some relief! <br />
<br />
Hank began by massaging the big shaft, his hands working their way up and down it. Slowly he pulled it away from Tyler&#39;s muscular torso, his mouth engulfing the leaking head. Tyler growled with pleasure as he felt Hank&#39;s talented mouth work on the tip of his dick while Hank&#39;s hands worked their way down its length until they found his huge, heavy balls. They ached like hell, but even as Hank&#39;s touch intensified the pain, it also heightened Tyler&#39;s pleasure. For the next ten minutes Hank sucked and caressed Tyler&#39;s huge endowment, until finally the big man could take no more foreplay. &quot;I need to fuck you!&quot; he roared, wrapping his powerful arms around Hank&#39;s solid torso and standing up with him, his big dick nestled between Hank&#39;s taut glutes. <br />
<br />
Hank hesitated for only a moment before nodding. &quot;I want you to...&quot; he whispered, just loud enough for Tyler to hear. That was all the big man needed. He brought Hank down onto his raging erection, letting out a bestial snarl of joy as he felt his new lover&#39;s ass wrap itself around his shaft. For his part Hank gasped loudly as the biggest dick he&#39;d ever taken entered him, rudely stretching his hole. It hurt like hell, but he put that aside as Tyler began to passionately, almost desperately kiss him. They remained entwined for the next two minutes, kissing eagerly, Hank&#39;s hands roaming Tyler&#39;s big arms and shoulders while his ass adjusted to the supersized dick that was overfilling it. Then Tyler began to pump, slowly at first, then with increasing vigor as he felt release approaching. Hank could only moan softly, barely able to think straight from the ecstasy he was experiencing as the huge football player fucked him standing up. He came repeatedly, shooting his load over Tyler&#39;s hairy abs. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t much longer before Tyler came as well. More than a month of pent-up need was released all at once as he shot a massive load into Hank, letting out a celebratory roar as every one of his big muscles tensed up all at once. He breathed heavily, his thick pecs rising and falling as he panted, feeling his dick spasm wildly inside his smaller lover. For his part Hank only moaned softly, mouth hanging open, nearly comatose from overwhelming pleasure. Tyler couldn&#39;t help but chuckle as he saw it. He held Hank close for several more minutes, gently kissing the other man&#39;s neck and shoulder. Slowly, Tyler softened, his big balls delightfully ache-free for the first time in weeks. He lowered Hank to the ground, then joined him there, falling back onto his muscular ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Tyler laughed, &quot;I haven&#39;t felt this good in ages!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither,&quot; Hank said softly, adding in a weak laugh of his own.</p>
