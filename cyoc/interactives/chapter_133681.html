<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stewart began to age up, his body went from that of a sexy teen to a more well rounded shape. Her breasts, ass, and thoughts evened out giving her a more balanced figure as she advanced in age past eighteen and all the way to twenty eight. She had always joked that life was over around this age and knew people began complaining about how old they were the second high school ended but she felt as energetic and healthy as ever, if not more.<br />
<br />
The two of them basically teleported into a different home, one that seemed to have been well established by a single couple, it was spacious and well decorated and the more Stewart stared at the decor the more she liked it, it hit a point where she realized she had decorated it, that the house was made up according to her tastes. Breanna nearly scared her, suddenly clothed with her hair still neatly done up and her hands rooting through her backpack. Stewart stared at her for a few seconds before she felt fabric on her own body. A pair of looser pants around the waist that got tight around her legs and a floral pattern shirt coloured purple, black, and blue. She pulled the colour off wonderfully and it seemed fashionable too with no sleeves and a nice belt over her baby bump held loosely against it.<br />
<br />
“Thanks again Mrs. Howard,” Breanna announced and Stewart stared at her in shock as his girlfriend, who hadn’t ever opened a textbook since they’d started dating, opened a Astronomy textbook with complex problems Stewart didn’t understand on it, “I didn’t quite get the Distance Modulus to Distance formula today, it kind of flew over my head.”<br />
<br />
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” is what Stewart wanted to say but instead she moved some of her hair back in a feminine manner and began to explain things about apparent magnitudes, absolute magnitudes, and who knows what else. It wasn’t like she didn’t know this stuff, it was the fact that she suddenly did, that all this information was flowing into her mind that she could suddenly access. It was baffling and Breanna just absorbed it, she understood the problems, she took notes like a diligent student, and when Stewart asked her some problems she got them right and gave her a hug before leaving with her books in hand.<br />
<br />
Stewart sat on the couch dumbfounded. She’d invited her over to ruin her school career not advance it. It was sickening and Stewart wanted to know what was going on. Unfortunately that didn’t happen as she got the urge to walk to the door, pick up a bag, and start marking complex physics problems. Stewart was at a loss, her male mind didn’t understand this stuff but her female one did and the more she called upon that female mind the stronger it got. She was suddenly able to do math with the snap of the fingers, could recall going to university, and was excited about seeing Mars that night. It was weird and she didn’t like it but the more she marked papers the more this new mind began to outnumber her old. She was a teacher for high school students and apparently she loved the job. It was baffling to her and she wanted nothing more than to regain control of her body, except she was in control and she was choosing to do this, that was the scary part, this wasn’t against her will, it just felt natural. So natural in fact that when the door opened and slammed she didn’t freak out but rather called out.<br />
<br />
“Hello dear!” She shouted as boots were pulled off and seconds later a man walked into the living room and smiled at her, “How was your day?”<br />
<br />
“Long but it’s over now,” He smiled before sitting on the couch next to her and pulling her in for a passionate kiss. Stewart couldn’t even react or pull away, instead she just leaned in suddenly unburying the enjoyment of that kiss. She was suddenly aware of the ring around her finger and one of the pictures on the wall depicting her in a white dress and this man in a formal tux. He was her husband and the name Donald Howard came to her mind as they broke their kiss.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm,” Stewart trailed while they pulled apart. She opened her eyes and felt an urge come over her that she wanted to resist but also wanted to power forward with.<br />
<br />
“What is it Selene?” Donald asked and she just grabbed his shoulders and pulled him close to her. His ear near her mouth. A witness formed in her vagina and while Stewart tried to resist he slowly but surely was overwritten by Selene. Any last resistance his mind put up was removed when Donald led her to the bedroom and undid his belt while she stripped and lay down. He approached her and went down on his knees. She wrapped her legs around his back and he entered her womb sending sensual pleasure through her body. His hands began to play with her breasts and a smile spread across her face. Pleasure wracked her body as she became a complete woman, Mrs. Selene Howard, a science teacher who wanted her female students to succeed instead of just becoming housewives and pumping out babies. She was having a baby after establishing her career and other girls could too.<br />
<br />
Selene and Don fucked for roughly half an hour, gravitating towards and away from orgasms. Don pulled out of her whenever they got too close and they ended up switching positions several times. Eventually an orgasm built up and Selene came letting her juices flow. The baby shifted around as if unsure why the orgasm was going on and likely reacting to her intensified heartbeat. Don pulled out of her and she sat up before kneeling on the floor and wrapping her breasts around his cock. She began to pump it using her mammaries and licked the tip. This boo job lasted about three minutes before she got quick and rough with it and soon enough cum spurted over her face, breasts, and neck. She giggled at the feeling and rose to full height and locked lips with Don. He ran his hands down her back to her ass and have it such a sensual squeeze that she moaned in response.<br />
<br />
“Still Horny eh?” He asked before he twisted her around and pushed her toward before entering her doggy style. Selene smiles in response. Days like this would become few and far between in the coming months so she was certain to enjoy it while she could.</p>
