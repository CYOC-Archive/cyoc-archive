<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... Puberty! and to do so we should get rid of some amount of modesty.&quot; you swiped your hand across the room and everyone&#39;s clothes vanished. Everyone started to try to cover up their parts. <br />
<br />
One well developed girl said &quot;We&#39;re  14, we&#39;ve already learned this a  year or two ago!&quot; You flung your hand towards the girl and her tits shrank inside her chest, her hips shrank inwards, her pussy  started reverting till it was basically just a piss hole, and then her memories of puberty vanished. A jock started giggling as he found what just happened funny and you flung your hand towards him as well. The testosterone powered muscles of him shrank to nearly nothing, a lot of his body hair shrank inside, then his penis and testicles shrank into his body turning into a similar piss hole as the other girl and he also forgot everything about puberty. Then you swept your hand across the room as the boys and girls had their genders and puberty reverted to nothing. Claire seemed to be doing the best having lost the least and now being more equal to the others. <br />
<br />
Curious to see how effective everything was you asked &quot;So everyone what&#39;s a boy and what&#39;s a girl?&quot; Everyone just looked around and no one knew what a boy or  girl actually was. So you said &quot;Well with this lesson i&#39;ll teach you all about puberty. To do so we&#39;re going to go to the gym!&quot; You closed your eyes, opened them, and switched your classroom with the gymnasium. The P.E. call there could just learn something useful. <br />
<br />
In the gym a bunch of heavy weights appeared and you asked &quot;Well why not try picking up those weights kids?&quot; everyone tried and some made them budge but they weren&#39;t strong enough. &quot;by the end of the first lesson you should be able to pick them up. Either way being a boy starts with this thing called a penis. The best way in my opinion to understand one is to have one.&quot; A wave of your hand and the class&#39; pee holes started to have a stick start expanding out of them and some testicles formed  after. The class was examining their new appendages when you said &quot;Puberty Time!&quot; then snapped your fingers and their dicks started growing and getting sensitive.  Some of the kids who had been fiddling with their dicks suddenly found themselves cumming. You said &quot;That white stuff coming out of your dicks is called Semen. When combined with a certain part with womens it can make a baby. However the women come latter first comes  the other affects of puberty. During puberty your dick matures and starts pumping out a lot of testosterone which does a bunch of things. For instance body hair!&quot; You snapped your fingers and suddenly the hairless boys started growing hair all over. Some were examining the tickling sensation on their underpits, some were scratching their chins, and some were still looking around their crotch. You continued &quot;And one bigger thing that comes with Puberty for men is an increase in size and muscle mass.&quot; Another snap  of your finger and suddenly all the guys in the gym started to grow as their muscles started bulging. The boys were trying to keep balance as they watched their biceps bulge,  their belly&#39;s turn to abs, and some of them getting relatively tall. You made sure Claire was the biggest of them all and built like a tank. They all were enjoying their big forms, running around real fast, and lifting the weights like they were no problem. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes you said &quot;Ok calm down and group up! We have the other gender to discuss, so sorry but i&#39;ve got to confiscate your puberty and dicks.&quot; a snap of your fingers and your class shrank back down to their genderless state. You said &quot;Like guys women have their own type of crotch known as a vagina, but unlike the guys a vagina sort of looks like a hole like you already have, but it&#39;s slightly different.&quot; you snap your fingers and now they had vagina&#39;s instead of just piss holes. &quot;Not too much different right? Well let&#39;s start with the puberty!&quot; A snap of your fingers and their vagina&#39;s started to develop further and started releasing a bunch of estrogen. &quot;Like male puberty female puberty involves growth in height and muscle mass but to a much lesser degree.&quot; then snap of the fingers and the girls grew a bit, but not as large as they used to be as guys. &quot;Now comes the fun part, Biologically girls are the one&#39;s that generally give birth to babies, and take care of them at a really young age. So a bunch of puberty for them prepares their body for  those things. For instance Boobies!!!&quot; a snap of the fingers and their chests started to swell and bounce. &quot;When you have a child they will start generating milk for the child. Following those children will come out of your vagina, but there&#39;s something that can make giving birth easier. Wider hips!&quot; you snapped your fingers and the girls&#39; legs started to spread apart as their hips started widening rather far. &quot;Now then that&#39;s all I have to teach you so i&#39;ll give you some homework. You&#39;ll have 9 months to have a kid and if you do so successfully you&#39;ll get an A&quot; then reached into your pants and jerked off your dick and then cummed a fountain of sperm that flew all across the gym covering the girls. The cum then was absorbed into the skin of all the girls and then you waved your hand across the room cleaning everything. &quot;Dismissed&quot; you said and then walked away thinking about what else to do.</p>
