<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean was pumped. 
<br>

<br>
 He wasn't about to go to sleep, late as it was getting. Not, at least, while he had the ability to fulfill one of his secret fantasies. 
<br>

<br>
 To shrink, like the guys in some of the online stories he liked, and see what the environment and others looked like from a new, smaller perspective. 
<br>

<br>
 Figuring that two was at least twice as good as one, Sean decided that the initial objects of his exploration would be Jay and Mark. 
<br>

<br>
 He set the parameters and a delay of 2 minutes, then crossed his fingers and hit the cproper key twice. That would ensure he'd revert to normal, just in case. A
<br>
 quick, irritating tingle signalled that the program had been initiated. 
<br>

<br>
 Realizing just a bit too late that he'd be unable to get to food and drink very soon, he quickly went to the kitchen and ate a banana and downed two glasses of
<br>
 water. 
<br>

<br>
 With 30 seconds to go, Sean walked to Jay's room and shut the door behind him. Since the sleep command was still in efffect, he felt safe truning on the lights. Jay
<br>
 and Mark were sound asleep, facing one another. Knees, elbows, hips and shoulders poked out sharply from their frail, skinny bodies. They were so small, so thin!
<br>

<br>

<br>
 With his fingers still on the swittch after flicking it upward, his hand slid down the wall. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Whoa,&quot; he thought, shaking his head. He was a bit disoriented. Turning, the room looked ... odd. He figured he'd dropped about a foot. He had to grab the waist
<br>
 of his pants and underwear, when they began glowing downwards. 
<br>

<br>
 An odd sensation ran through him. Sean looked down - the floor was ... close. Two feet lost now! His clothing was actually an encumbrance, Sean let it drop
<br>
 completely. 
<br>

<br>
 He walked to the edge of the bed as one, then another change occurred. Four feet shorter, Sean's head just cleared the top of the mattress - along expanse of
<br>
 fabric stretched out in front of him; on top of it were the soles of four huge feet, attached to two apparently giant-sized people, stretching off into the ditance,
<br>
 perspective making them seem to blur into one far, far way. Craning his neck, the ceiling looked impossibly far away. 
<br>

<br>
 Then he blinked and saw nothing but darkness. 
<br>

<br>
 Confused at first, Sean realized the was looking at the space under the bed, shadowed, but, once his eyes adjusted, he could make out the shapes of some now
<br>
 suitcase-sized dust bunnies. He was less than one foot tall now. 
<br>

<br>
 He actually had to step up and over the mound of his pants and underwear to escape them. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Get it together, Sean,&quot; he thought, smiling. He WAS enjoying the experinece. &quot;Better get up to the bed NOW.&quot; Sean grabbed the edge of the sheet and began
<br>
 hauling himself up, hand over hand. As the final changes kicked in, the climb became longer and longer. It became difficult to get a good grip on the fabric, which
<br>
 became increasingly more slick as his hands shrunk down. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it,&quot; Sean kept repeating to himself. He had set the program to 2-1/2 inches. 
<br>

<br>
 Hauling himself to the top of the bed, the last size change happened. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Alright! I made it. Hot damn!&quot; Sean shouted, then fell down, laughing. He hadn't realized how absoultely bizarre his voice now sounded - like a Munchkin after
<br>
 inhaling too much helium, as his vocal chords were now miniscule, too. 
<br>

<br>
 After a minute, Sean regained enough composure to take stock. His tiny body barely made an impression on the blue sheet of the bed. &quot;Good thing I didn't cover
<br>
 them up,&quot; Sean mused, &quot;Otherwise, I could never lift the blanket, much less see under it!&quot; He figured he had about 55 minutes left, and started hiking ahead,
<br>
 whistling as he walked. 
<br>

<br>
 Looming up ahead of him were the feet of the sleeping men. Sean noticed the smells first - sweaty and earthy. 
<br>

<br>
 He reached Jay's foot. It arched upward, 4 times little Sean's height now. 
<br>

<br>
 Stopping to catch his breath (it HAD been a long hike from the edge, after all) Sean placed his palm flat against the coarse, warm flesh of Jay's sole and leaned on
<br>
 the foot for support. A shadow crossed over him, retreated, then returned. Looking straight up, Sean saw Jay's toes wiggling, perhaps in response to his (slight)
<br>
 weight pressing on his sole. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Holy ... I could get squashed if he shifts position!&quot; Sean realized, and removed his hand. Another 5 minutes had passed, but sean was unaware of how long it had
<br>
 taken him to get as far along as he was. 
<br>

<br>
 One of the guys moaned. To Sean's ears, It was an extremely loud sound that seemed to fill the room. 
<br>

<br>
 He wanted to try so many things - to try to replicate as many of the experiences he'd only read about, and began running up between the two sleeping, though
<br>
 much shorter and stick-thin, men. 
<br>

<br>
 In a canyon bordered with verical expanses of hairy flesh, Sean ran. And ran. 
<br>

<br>
 The further along he got, the dimmer it became. he could still see just fine, but hadn't realized how much of the light the legs of Jay and Mark would be blocking off.
<br>
 The 'walls' on either side of him grew higher and higher. 
<br>

<br>
 Suddenly, Seasn stopped cold, overcome with the spicy, musky, earthy odor that engulfed him. 
<br>
 &quot;What the ....?&quot; he thought, then realized it must be the combined smell of the sweat,grime and ... whatever from the guy's crotches. 
<br>

<br>
 sSan gagged and coughed, but soon enough became accustomed and was able to breathe, albeit shallowly. 
<br>

<br>
 Like some giant sea urchin, the hairy scrotums of Mark and Jay appeared on either side of Sean.sean moved to the nearest one and marveled that he was about as
<br>
 high as the rounded bulge on the bottom of the fleshy sac, now, to his eyes, covered in deep puckers and crevices. 
<br>

<br>
 Reaching both arms out, he embraced the testicle closes to him. He actually had to use some effort to bend the hairs that were poking uncomfortably at him, but
<br>
 they did give way. The feeling certainly was strange: warm, of course, and somewhat pillow-like, giving to his poressure. Sean could feel the blod flowing through
<br>
 capillaries. 
<br>

<br>
 After a minute, he moved on. 
<br>

<br>
 Ahead, on the left, was a dark, murky area: Jay's pubic hair. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean saw the brighter, lighter tip of his roomate's dick in the tangled mass of hair. That was all that showed now, after Sean's last use of the CHRONIVAC on the
<br>
 guys. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean stopped and looked up at the dimpled surface of the head, darker pinks ridges markeing the slit in the center. 
<br>

<br>
 He couldn't resist, and pushed both hands onto the skin, which spongily 'gave' a bit at his effort, then bucked away from his touch. &quot;Oops. Don't want to give him a
<br>
 hard-on,&quot; Sean said, and turned and walked to the other man's tool. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark had much sparser pubic hair, so Sean could make out almost the entire (diminshed) length of the, to him, huge dick. He decided to try to reach the top and
<br>
 haul himself up. Feet kicking in the air, he did manage this and sat down on the soft, warm, slightly pulsing skin.sean w9iaggled his butt to creat a comfy
<br>
 deperesssion. The surface actually moved up and down a bit with each brath that Mark took. 
<br>

<br>
 On a whim, Sean began massaging his own dick in time to the movement, and soon enough (much sooner than usual) had masturbated and come. He wiped his
<br>
 messy hand across the edge of the fold in Mark's skin closest to him. 
<br>

<br>
 From his seat, Sean looked further up the bed. and saw what looked like two huge bowls standing on edge, one on each side of the path he woulf be following.
<br>
 The skinny guys' stomachs. He could see their heads now, but they were so-o-o far away. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;No time like the present,&quot; Sean said aloud in his little gremlin voice. &quot;Geronimo!&quot; He closed his eyes, held his nose and let himself slip off his perch. The fall wasn't
<br>
 all that long, and the soft sheets broke the impact. 
<br>

<br>
 Further up the bed Sean moved. At Jay's navel, Sean stopped to reach up and stick his entire balled-up fist inside, enveloping his hand and wrist in a cocoon of
<br>
 skin. 
<br>

<br>
 A loud rumbling, like a convention of subway sounds, made Sean pull his hand out and cover his ears. Looking around nervously, it dawned on him that the sound
<br>
 was only the gurgling of Jay's digestive tract. 
<br>

<br>
 He could breathe better now, the smell dissipating behind him as he moved on. 
<br>

<br>
 As if they made up some grossly oversized picket fence, Sean stuck his arm out and let his fingers strum along each of Jay's very noticaeable ribs him as he
<br>
 diligently traveled forward. 
<br>

<br>
 It was getting brighter now, from Sean's perspective, and he finally reached the underside of the first chin, a pattern of (to him) sharp, spiky hairs dotting the
<br>
 'landscape.' Beard stubble. 
<br>

<br>
 A noise like a thunderclap, but much higher-pitched, made sean turn to face Mark, who had just clucked his tongue in his sleep. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean moved on, going to Mark's lips, which now appeared like two streaks of distressed naugahyde. 
<br>

<br>
 *WHOOSH* A blast of warm, moist air caught Sean on the his left side and wafted over him. Mark had exhaled through his nostrils. &quot;Geez, Louise,&quot; Sean
<br>
 thought. &quot;None of the stories I read mentioned stuff like this!&quot; Another warm breeze descended on him. 
<br>

<br>
 Sean moved closer to Mark and, nervously, lighlly poked Mark's lip. he pressed closer, so close that his own now erect dick pressed against the lip in front of him.
<br>
 &quot;Well, that's a new feeling,&quot; he thought. 
<br>

<br>
 Mark, asleep of course, apparently decided that that moment was the perfect time to lick his lips. 
<br>

<br>
 A large, wet, pink mass of tongue lapped across Sean's body, then disappeared, Sean saw it as actually quite ugly - bumpy and with strands of goo here and there.
<br>
 But the feeling was indescribable, like soaking in a hot tub and being given a full body shiatsu massage all at once. 
<br>

<br>
 Accompanied by a loud grunt, Jay, behind Sean, slightly shifted position and moved his hand up to scratch at something nonexistent on his face. Just the top of
<br>
 Jay's fingertips caught Sean unawares and batted him from Mark's lips. 
<br>

<br>
 He ended up splayed on his stomach, tangled in Mark's hair, which, against Sean's skin, was abrasive and a little oily. Weighing probably less than an ounce now,
<br>
 the fall hadn't hurt him, But he rubbed the spot where Jay had made contact. &quot;That's gonna leave a bruise,&quot; he said, laughing, then, trying to stand up, realized how
<br>
 snarled in the web of Mark's hair he was. 
<br>

<br>
 By now Sean had lost all track of the time.</p>
