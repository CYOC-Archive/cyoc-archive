<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane was considering going down to the party to merge with one of the girls there, but she wasn&#39;t quite sure how to get down there without being noticed, let along fuse with a girl without causing a scene. The ring might be able to bend reality, but she doubted people would just forget a girl sinking into a catgirl&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Then a new memory from Jubilee popped into Jane&#39;s head. Not EVERY girl in the sorority was down at the party. A few had decided to stay in their rooms for various reasons. And thanks to Jubilee&#39;s memories, Jane knew who those girls were and where their rooms were. Jane smirked to herself  before sauntering out. There was little need to be sneaky. With the loud party going on downstairs, no one would hear her and these girls weren&#39;t likely to leave their rooms.<br />
<br />
And Jane knew exactly who to target first. Her actual name was Harriet, but most people called her Scary Harri. She was easily the biggest girl in the sorority and unquestionable one of the strongest people on campus. Nobody ever messed with Harri, so she did make very good money as a bodyguard for hire. Most typically, it was to other girls would otherwise be an open target for bullying. Her current contractor was Kiki, a very brainy girl who was also known to be a lesbian. Naturally, there were plenty of rumors about Harri and Kiki, but nobody was brave enough to mention in Harri&#39;s hearing range. But Jane wasn&#39;t interested in that. Well, she was kinda interested, but she more interested in Harri&#39;s big muscles and considerable height to add to her own.<br />
<br />
Jane found Harri&#39;s room pretty easily and it was simple to sneak in without being heard. Harri was a bit too preoccupied at the moment to pay attention. She was busy lifting dumbbells as part of her exercises. Jane admired Harri&#39;s body; tall, muscular, enough curves to not make her too brutish, deep brown skin, and a not-unpleasant face. Her sports bra and gym shorts worked well to show off her Amazonian body. Her dark hair was cropped pretty shortly which might take some length off of Jane&#39;s tresses, but that wouldn&#39;t be so bad.<br />
<br />
But absorbing Harri wouldn&#39;t be so straightforward. Jubilee was easy to grab, but Harri might put up a fierce struggle. So Jane wouldn&#39;t be taking her in slowly this time. That was fine with her because she didn&#39;t feel any particular vindictiveness against Harri. All Jane would have to do is grab her skin and it&#39;ll be over. And her sports bra left more than enough of her back bared for Jane to place her hand on. Harri froze in surprise before simply winking out of existence.<br />
<br />
Jane crooned with pleasure before walking over to a mirror to watch the process. She could see herself getting taller as well as bulking up, but her curves didn&#39;t get completely diminished. Well, her breasts were smaller than before, but not by a whole lot. She also saw herself becoming more human. She could feel the fur retracting on her body, which felt like a tickling sensation across her skin. Her clothes also altered to allow her to see her shifting skin more clearly. The t-shirt and bra she took from Jubilee were fusing and shrinking down into a sports bra while Juanita&#39;s pants were becoming gym shorts. Juanita&#39;s Hispanic heritage was mixing with Harri&#39;s ebony skin to produce a rich chocolate color. She could also see Harri&#39;s influence in her face, namely her lips. Interestingly, actually got darker, with her black hair now taking up the whole back half of her head and her blonde hair the front.<br />
<br />
Jane took off her clothes to see the full extent of her change. She was significantly more cat than human now. The only fur on her body was on her hands up to her elbows, her feet up to her knees, and her tail and ears. The only feline traces in her face were her slightly sharper canines and her pupils that became slits in the right light. Everything else was her new chocolate color. Jane moaned as she rubbed her enhanced body, especially her sizeable breasts. The need to explore her maturing body had been building up with each fusion. At this point, she could resist herself no longer.<br />
<br />
Jane lied down on Harri&#39;s bed. Or perhaps it was hers now. It didn&#39;t matter to Jane right now. She caressed her left breast with one hand while her right hand slid down and massaged her pussy. Jane gasped as she felt herself get wetter. This was better than when she had fused with the fox. Eventually, she let her fur-covered fingers pass between her lower lips and let out another moan. She increased her ministrations with rising enthusiasm. Her toes clenched, popping out her claws. She was careful not to do the same with her fingers considering where they were right now. She could feel the heat rising inside her as she reached her peak. With a small cry, she reached her climax, her sweet juices squirting against her hand.<br />
<br />
Jane panted as her body cooled down. As intoxicating as this was, she didn&#39;t let her mind wander in the bliss. She was already considering her next fusion. Her obvious choice was Kiki, who Jane was now contracted to. Searching through Harri&#39;s memories brought up some interesting facts. The rumors about Harri and Kiki were only half-true. Kiki was infatuated with Harri, which Harri was aware of. But while Harri didn&#39;t feel the same way about Kiki, she didn&#39;t rebuff either. In fact, she mostly acted like the one-sided crush didn&#39;t exist.<br />
<br />
Juanita and Jubilee weren&#39;t lesbian either and Jane also had a stronger interest in boys. But Jane felt a little bit of bi-curiosity. She was at an age where she was coming to term with her sexual interests. Jane didn&#39;t feel a strong pull towards girls, but she did wonder about it a few times. Considering Kiki&#39;s unrequited feelings, it will be easy for Jane to coax her into a position that would allow them to fuse.</p>
