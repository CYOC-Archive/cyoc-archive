<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The Werewolf Prince and I almost posted simultaneously. It happens sometimes, but thankfully I was able to transfer my episode to the end of his just in time.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The engaged couple continued to kiss even as fur began to sprout from their limbs.<br />
Soon a Japanese bobtail werecat was staring deeply into the eyes of her Persian werecat mate.<br />
&quot;Do you know how much I love you?&quot; Claire Jacobs asked Jen Decker.<br />
&quot;I can hazard a guess,&quot; quipped Jen, even as she felt Claire&#39;s paws undress her, freeing her fursona from the confining clothing she had on.<br />
Soon Claire was suckling on Jen&#39;s bountiful bosom even as her paws caressed her fiance&#39;s soft fur, working their way down to the pleasure pit between the lady&#39;s legs.<br />
Jen, while enjoying the moment and attention, wasn&#39;t idle. She did her best to undress Claire even as she nuzzled her neck and played with Claire&#39;s ear, which was rapidly becoming an erogenous zone for the latest member of were society.<br />
Now as free as nature intended them to be, Jen and Claire held each other close.<br />
Their breasts rubbed against each other even as each lady thrilled at the sensual touch of her mate&#39;s furry body.<br />
<br />
Then Claire stared at Jen and wondered, &quot;Is it too soon in our relationship to ask for a favor?&quot;<br />
Jen was a bit taken aback at that. There had been no one else in her life since her husband&#39;s death, and now Claire was her future since she gave Claire her heart&#39;s desire by turning her into a werecat.<br />
Yet there was also no denying that, despite the short time of their relationship, Jen loved Claire, so simply asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve made love a lot of times already,&quot; began Claire, even as she started nuzzling Jen&#39;s neck and muzzle. &quot;Yet there&#39;s one place I want to do it to truly celebrate being free and the werecat I always dreamed of becoming.&quot;<br />
&quot;Where?&quot; asked Jen.<br />
&quot;Outside, under the stars, as close to nature as we can be,&quot; suggested Claire, before giving Jen a kiss that hinted of things to come.<br />
Jen smiled upon hearing Claire&#39;s request and said, &quot;Certainly.&quot;<br />
Then, without another word between them, Jen took Claire&#39;s paw in hers and led them through the Decker house and out the backdoor.<br />
<br />
Like most houses in Moon Lake, the Decker property wasn&#39;t fenced in because weres, besides trusting one another, liked having as much access to open land and nature as possible.*<br />
Considering it was late in the evening of November 6, 2015, the weather was a bit on the chilly side.<br />
The unusually prolonged Indian Summer Washington state had experienced was over and the dew on the grass tickled the undersides of their paws as they walked, but neither Jen nor Claire cared.<br />
Besides their fur coats, the thrill of holding the other&#39;s paw, the feel of their bodies close together, let alone the intimacy they would soon share, was more than enough to keep the ladies warm as Jen led them out into the openness behind her house.<br />
&quot;How&#39;s this?&quot; she asked, pulling Claire closer to her.<br />
Claire looked around. A line of trees could be seen the distance on one side and a hint of the rears of other houses on their block lined the other side.<br />
A quick glance upward revealed that clouds obscured more of the stars than she would have liked. <br />
The moon itself was nowhere in sight, but Claire turned back to look at Jen and said, &quot;Purrfect!&quot;<br />
With that, the two ladies began to kiss again.<br />
<br />
Soon they were purring in both pleasure and excitement as the women laid on the grass, neither caring about the dew moistening their fur.<br />
Claire took the initiative, which made Jen proud, as she kissed her way down the Persian&#39;s body.<br />
Butterfly kisses circled Jen&#39;s breasts as Claire&#39;s paws gently massaged them.<br />
Although not having been a werecat for very long, let alone a full fledged lesbian until she gained her fursona**, Claire was a fast learner.<br />
Jen was moaning in pleasure just from the attention of her breasts. Her tail started swishing like crazy even as Claire maintained the oral love of her bosom.<br />
It was a complete and utter surprise when Jen started mewing &quot;I&#39;m cumming!&quot;<br />
Claire just smiled the best she could, although her muzzle, mouth, and tongue never left their target until Jen reluctantly pushed her fiance away.<br />
<br />
Jen sat up and tried to catch her breath as Claire sat next to her in the grass, nuzzling her future wife&#39;s neck with tender kisses even as one paw began rubbing Jen&#39;s back and the other started drifting down her belly toward the matted patch of fur wet with female juices between Jen&#39;s legs.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never... Where?&quot; Jen finally asked.<br />
Claire reluctantly tore herself away from Jen&#39;s neck and stared at her lover.<br />
&quot;Dang if I know,&quot; admitted Claire. &quot;It was just something I&#39;ve been thinking about, because I love how your nipples feel in my mouth.&quot;<br />
&quot;Even my husband has never been able to fully bring me to orgasm just from oral attention to my breasts, and God how he tried!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to take anything away from him,&quot; began Claire, even as she came close enough so that the tip of each lady&#39;s nose was touching, &quot;but like I said before, you&#39;ve given me such a precious gift by making me a werecat that I intend to spend the rest of my now extended life showing you how much I love and care for you. I love mew, Jen Decker.&quot;<br />
Jen smiled and said &quot;I love mew too Claire Jacobs.&quot;<br />
The two ladies embraced and began to kiss once more.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before they found themselves prone on the grass in the traditional 69 position, with each joyfully lapping up the cream from between the other&#39;s legs.<br />
Neither werecat could get enough of their mate&#39;s honey.<br />
Talented tongues dived deep into furry chalices and teased the hardened clit above the entrance to such treasure.<br />
Even after the first round of orgasmic bliss racked their bodies with sexual satisfaction, Jen and Claire continued to drink from their mate&#39;s loving cup.<br />
How long each pleased the other they neither knew or cared.<br />
All that mattered was the tasty treat issuing forth and the love each gave and shared freely.<br />
<br />
Finally, there came a point where each lady needed to stop and rest.<br />
Claire turned around until she was facing Jen again.<br />
Their kisses now shared the taste of each other, but neither cared.<br />
Then, with another &quot;I love mew,&quot; on her lips, Claire snuggled close to Jen and started to drift off for a pleasurable and much needed catnap.<br />
&quot;I love mew too darling,&quot; said Jen, kissing Claire on her furry forehead, before drifting off to sleep too.<br />
