<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In his deep sleep, Alec could only stare at the other figure in this void with the only source of illumination being an unseen spotlight above him and the minotaur across from him.<br />
<br />
The muscular beast of a humanoid was roaring and swinging its... arms blindly as if the spotlight didn&#39;t aid him in his vision. Of course, Alec knew the light was a representation of this mindscape aided by his power to see and hear, the minotaur in front of him blind and deaf thanks to his body&#39;s usurper stealing away his body and going to sleep.<br />
<br />
The only thing he doesn&#39;t know was how long time passed in there. Some of his previous hosts sat down and cried. Some told away their memories to keep themselves sane. As if trapped inside a sensory deprivation box, they had no senses but their mind to keep them company.<br />
<br />
Try as they might to move around blindly, they went nowhere. Alec could see them walking in place, with no anchor to discern movement. He could go closer if he wanted, but the moment he tried to touch the host, an invisible box stopped him.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the body would wake and the same thing happens every time. He&#39;d be unable to remember whatever happened here, but each time he came here, it was as if he never left.<br />
<br />
In a paradoxical display, the headlights above them started to dim. The body was well rested and about to wake up now. Most times this place lasted mere moments, just like dreams do.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Alec blinked open crusty eyes as he stirred awake, his brain slowly starting up as he stared at the straw roofing with no rays of light piercing through. Yawning as he shielded his eyes from the light entering through the open window with a thick arm, he considered sleeping in before his goal of being here popped up in his brain.<br />
<br />
Get minotaur milk, go back to his body.<br />
<br />
His growling stomach brought his attention to the fact that he was feeling hungry. Assuming that this body&#39;s metabolism was insane even in sleep, there was no way he was going to find milk with an empty fuel tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huhuh, tank.&quot; Alec chuckled, coming out with a dumb guffaw. He lifted his arm away and flexed on instinct, seeing the veins pop on the melon stuffed under the leathery skin. He sat up and looked down, only to see that his chest was clean of his emissions from last night. Did someone come in and clean him up? Do all minotaurs get this kind of service? <br />
<br />
Deep inside, he got the feeling that indeed, the females come in and clean up the warriors after their respected service of defending them and their loved ones in their log huts, within this almost impenetrable fortress of beef and wood. Alec sighed, he missed a chance to have sex with a female minotaur and milk her for milk. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I can just get some from a bottled source.” He murmured to himself, looking around the familiar hut that he now lived in. Seeing his kilt and armor, he stood up and prepared for the day. Lifting the armor off its hook and sliding his muscular arms into its sleeves, Alec got himself ready. He looked around but saw no other clothing for use. The minotaurs might be a race that doesn’t wear clothes, opting to be battle-ready at all times.<br />
<br />
Taking up his axe, he ducked out of the hut and saw the afternoon sun in the apex of the sky. He missed breakfast, most likely.<br />
<br />
“Food, where would that table be. Might as well ask around and check rather than walking around like last night.” Alec nodded to himself as he saw another minotaur, this time obviously a female. She had the tits of the century, but it didn’t seem engorged. He expected them to have an hourglass figure, but no. She was as brawny as the males could be, thick-bodied though a little bit shorter, evidenced as he stood next to her. She wore a cloth around her waist to cover her private parts and a sash of fabric over her shoulders. All of the fabric on her were sullen and aged but nonetheless did its job.<br />
<br />
“Uh, can I know where to get food, miss?” He asked with as much politeness as he could, the calm way she responded as she turned to face him, her cow face confused. <br />
<br />
“It’s by the canteen hall. Did you oversleep until you forget?” She remarked with a chuckle, returning to her work of hanging the damp fabrics she had in front of her in a woven basket. “Canteen hall straight from here if you forgot that too.” She pointed to a direction that with the sun as his guide, would be East of the fortress.<br />
<br />
“Ah, thank you. Drank too much last night.” He lied with a believable smile. He turned to try to find a route he could use to get there, but before he could go, she interrupted him.<br />
<br />
“Last night? You slept for the whole of yesterday. I cleaned you up.” She said nonchalantly as she bent over to hoist up another damp cloth. “You went to sleep tired and also relieved yourself, quite tiring activities right before bed.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, why would I sleep that long?” Alec was inwardly starting to panic, he missed a whole day?!<br />
<br />
“3 days of guard duty and 2 days of rest. Minotaurs are a hardy bunch, but orgasm knocks us out for at least a day.” She chuckled as if it was common knowledge. “Don’t tell me you forgot that. You’re a minotaur.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, just some tiredness. Apologies for bothering you.” Alec hurriedly nodded to her and backed off, but before he could walk to the Canteen Hall to get the milk and get the fuck out, she called out to him again.<br />
<br />
“Considering you slept like a calf, there’s some information you need to know.” She started without breaking her activity. “Got a group of human intruders in the jail, the unconscious one having a curse being too dangerous. That one is getting executed today.”<br />
<br />
Alec froze. Cold sweat and shivers moved down his body as he stood still. The dread of mortality was upon him as he immediately switched tracks. Panicking, he quickly asked her the questions now rapidly bombarding the slow brain he was processing thoughts with now.<br />
“Execution where?!” Alec almost shouted, seeing her turn to him with shock in her eyes. She flinched back but then schooled herself.<br />
<br />
“West of here. You can’t miss it.” She looked at him critically, gouging him. But Alec was already running off.</p>
