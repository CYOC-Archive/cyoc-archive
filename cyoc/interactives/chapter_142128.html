<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“My name’s Aaron,” Ben’s new acquaintance said on the ride home. “Thank you very much for buying me, to be honest I expected some rich old troll to put in for me. I’m glad it was somebody as handsome as you!”<br />
“Damn straight. You’re a prize, Aaron, one only I deserve to win.” Ben answered. He smiled smugly and gave the young man an appreciative stroke on his cheek. He was exceptionally gorgeous, after all. He was slender and boyish, with smooth skin, a toned, lithe body, beautiful blue eyes and silky, golden hair. All the right features in all the right places. He could be mistaken for a supermodel. Not for much longer though, Ben thought as they gazed at each other.<br />
Aaron simply blushed in response to this half-compliment, seemingly flattered enough to overlook Ben’s self aggrandizement. “Uh... so what do you do?” Aaron asked. “You’re pretty ripped... are you a boxer or something? Not an actor? It’s gotta be something that pays well, if you could afford the auction...”<br />
Later in Ben’s living room, Aaron was still talking as Ben tossed his keys on a table and went straight to his laptop. The Chronivac was already plugged in.<br />
“I volunteered for the auction too,” he continued on, having launched into his own life story. “I’m really turned on by the idea of giving myself over to somebody completely, I wanna be a slave! I feel like my purpose is... how do I put this...”<br />
“To take my cum,” Ben interjected, not looking up as he typed away.<br />
“Yeah!!” Aaron agreed, and then laughed. “That’s it exactly. I mean, that’s just when I’m horny, of course, I do want to live a normal life—“<br />
“You sure like to talk,” Ben interrupted. “How about we get straight to plugging that face hole of yours.” He hit enter on the computer, and stood up to unzip his pants.<br />
Aaron blushed again, his knees bent in shyly. “O-oh, sure!” He chirped, embarrassed but clearly excited. “Make me yours, m-master!”<br />
“Not bad for a start,” Ben said, unfurling his nearly three-foot cock. “We’ll work on your begging later though. For now, state your purpose.”<br />
Ben’s dick hovered tantalizingly in front of Aaron, whose eyes widened. His looks had gained him many a lay over his life, and he’d never seen a cum cannon that big. Immediately falling to his knees, he intoned as if hypnotized. “My purpose is to take your cum.”<br />
Ben smiled wickedly and pointed down at his cock. Aaron wasted no time and set to trying to force the cockhead into his mouth. Not noticing the Chronivac whirring to life, he slowly edged his mouth farther and farther down Ben’s length, swallowing his meat so greedily that he didn’t notice how far his mouth was stretching. Eventually, he reached the base. Ben smiled, having had an excellent view of the young man turning into a condom.<br />
“Not bad at all,” he said as he sat back on his couch, getting comfortable and starting to jerk himself off. “Even Matt never unrolled himself for me.” The musclebound master took a quick glance at the clock on the wall nearby, and started to quicken his pace. “A little late... but he should be getting it just about now... you’re going to like this, Bitch-Boy.”<br />
Aaron could feel it before Ben was even finished speaking. Already stretched tighter than he had ever felt before, he could sense his new rubber body was being pulled even farther. Ben’s cock was growing, and if he had eyes to see with, he would have seen Ben striking a double bicep pose as his muscles started to increase as well. He’d been at a reasonable two hundred pounds at least, and looked to be packing on another fifty already.<br />
“Beautiful!” He laughed, and went back to massaging his cock. Aaron was stretched so thinly over him that it almost felt like he wasn’t there at all. “Must have been a gangbang, this is a pretty decent load! Oh, you didn’t meet my ex. Every time he gets jizzed in, I get bigger. Pretty fucking sweet, right? I can count on gains from that lardass for the rest of his life. Good thing he’s such a disgusting pig for cum.”<br />
Aaron wasn’t sure what to think. What started as the most promising day of his life had definitely taken a turn for the strange. He was only barely starting to comprehend his new body, and now Ben was telling him he’d only be getting bigger? He tried to speak, or at least peel his rubber ring of a mouth off Ben’s dick, but found he couldn’t move at all in this new form. All he could do was surrender to the sensation of being mercilessly face-fucked by the biggest cock he’d ever had, and probably ever would again. It wasn’t long before his mind was completely numbed by the pleasure, and the only thoughts he could process were of how colossal this cock inside of him was, and how tight and full he felt.<br />
Meanwhile, Ben was clearly getting ready to stretch Aaron much further. His tongue lolled out of his mouth, his face twisted with lust and drunk from power. Rolling his eyes back, he shouted at the ceiling and gripped his cock tightly, making sure his condom slave couldn’t fly off. “YES! FUCK YES!! TAKE MY SEED BITCH!!” He roared, and gave a powerful thrust as he started spewing. Aaron’s mind was blown as his body rapidly swelled, gallons of spunk surging into him faster than he could have ever anticipated. He wanted to scream as he was overwhelmed by the sensation of being filled so completely, and it wasn’t stopping, either. Ben rolled his head to the side, still riding the orgasm as he watched the clock on the wall. “Fifcheen sheconds...” he slurred to himself, tongue still hanging out. He started flexing again, purely for his own enjoyment as there was nobody else in the room able to see. “Two minutes...” he added as time went on. “T-twelve minutshhhh... I’m... a fucking... STUD!!!”<br />
Nearly forty minutes passed before Ben’s flow slowed to a trickle. Aaron had swollen to almost four feet around, and sagged to the floor around Ben’s feet. Ben, grinning in sleepy satisfaction, reached over and clicked his laptop. In only a few seconds, Aaron returned to his human form, sliding off Ben’s junk as his features returned and leaving a smear of cum from his lips all the way down.<br />
“Ben... that was... incredible,” he gasped, and reached up to wipe the cum from his face. However, his hand met something soft, warm and big. “Something the matter, Bitch-Boy?” Ben chuckled.<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK??” Aaron screamed. His body was already beyond recognition. Not only was his belly round and obvious, replacing the gentle curves of his boyish six-pack that he’d worked years to achieve. To add insult to injury, for some reason his firm, understated twink pecs had ballooned out into massive pillows of man-boob. They were plump and round, enlarged nipples pointing, almost having achieved the shape of real breasts.<br />
“That’s why I called you Bitch-Boy,” said Ben. “A pair of titties like that can only belong to a breeding bitch.”<br />
“What did you do to my body?!” Aaron shouted, nearly sobbing. “I’m not playing around any more! My beautiful body...”<br />
“Whatever, fattycakes,” Ben said, and stood up, taking a wide stance. “Just enjoy the gun show, all that weight you put on should be doing it’s job any second now... this one’s gotta add at least a hundred pounds of beef...”</p>
