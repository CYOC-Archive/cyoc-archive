<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allison stood against the wall, by a stack of boxes, watching.<br />
Brandon stood there by the closed door, dazed and mesmerized.<br />
&quot;Change him back. Please Matthew. I'll do anything.&quot; said Allison, hopefully.<br />
Matthew nodded.<br />
&quot;I know, I know. I gave my word.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, Matthew had a few concerns. First: Matthew couldn't do a separation, because with Mark and Walter were two minds in a body; whereas the Jocks had replaced Simon outright with Brandon, and Simon technically no longer existed.<br />
This didn't worry Matthew long, on the grounds that, until a few hours ago, Brandon hadn't existed, either.<br />
<br />
The second thought, though, worried him a great deal. Removing Brandon from the equation risked the creation of a Paradox, a defilement of reality itself. Brandon was the Captain, now, and removing him would mean that the team had no Captain, since Mark was by definition NOT the Captain, at least not yet. How would the watch compensate for this flaw of logic?<br />
<br />
Matthew glanced at Allison. Her eyes held lust for Brandon's body, but beneath that was a deep fear for Simon's soul. Matthew was just about to throw caution to the wind and bring back Simon...<br />
<br />
...When inspiration dawned in his mind, like the sunrise after a particularly stormy night.<br />
He didn't HAVE to choose between Simon and Brandon.<br />
&quot;Ha. Hahah. HAHAHAH! Of course!&quot;<br />
Allison blinked, and looked worried.<br />
&quot;Um, Matthew?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hush, Allison. Brandon. I need you to remember. Remember a few hours ago. Remember when you were Simon. Brandon is going to go to sleep now. We need to talk to Simon. Wake up, Simon. Who are you?&quot;<br />
The muscular boy raised his head a bit.<br />
&quot;I'm...Si...mon? Simon? I'm Simon.&quot;<br />
He shook his head.<br />
&quot;Uh...Matthew? Allison? What happened? The football team had grabbed me, I was in the locker room...&quot;<br />
He glanced down at himself.<br />
&quot;HOLY-!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon was shocked to find himself in what, to him, appeared to be Brendan's body, with Mark's cock. Allison was even more shocked. They both began speaking at once.<br />
&quot;Matthew, what-&quot;<br />
Matthew cut them off with a wave of his hand.<br />
&quot;Now, both of you, calm down. I need to speak with both of you, now that you're together. Simon, do you remember what it was like being Brandon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon screwed up his, or rather, Brandon's, eyes.<br />
&quot;Ye-yeah, I do. Huh. That was...weird. I was a jock. It's all fuzzy, though. Some parts are fuzzier than others.&quot;<br />
&quot;For instance?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I can remember the last few hours alright, but the rest of Brandon's life is practically not there at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew nodded in understanding.<br />
&quot;Doubtless because, other than those few hours, Brandon didn't exist. Now, Simon. Do you know why I brought you back?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because you didn't want another jock running around?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew sighed.<br />
&quot;No. What do I care about Jocks? I'll graduate in a few months, and then they'll all be someonelse's problem. It's why I brought Mark back to normal, barring making him less of an asshole. No, I brought you back because Allison asked me to, and Allison asked me to because, to put it bluntly, she's in love with you you dumbfuck! She's been trying to get you to ask her out for weeks! Pie Jesu, you were thick even as a geek!&quot;<br />
Allison and Simon were both blushing madly, and Simon glanced at her shyly. It was incongruous on Brandon's jocky features. <br />
&quot;Is that true?&quot;<br />
Allison was on the verge of tears.<br />
&quot;Of course it is! Why would you have thought otherwise?&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon looked even more bashful, and stared at the floor.<br />
&quot;Well, I knew you had, um, availed yourself of the computer club's cameras. I thought you wanted someone more like, you know, Brandon.&quot;<br />
Allison looked heartbroken.<br />
&quot;Oh, God, Simon I'm so sorry! I never meant- yes, I find the jocks sexy, but I'm only human! It's you I love, Simon, not them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
&quot;Truly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, Allison, thank you! I love you to! Please, would you do me the honor of going out with me?&quot;<br />
Allison wiped a tear from her eye.<br />
&quot;Of course, you big silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew coughed loudly.<br />
&quot;And on that note, lovebirds, I think it's time for me to play Friendly Neighborhood Fairy Godfather, so imagine this all delivered in my best Brando impersonation. Allison, you find Brandon extremely attractive but love Simon, and Simon, you love Allison, but as Brandon you're extremely popular. I submit that you don't need to choose between Brandon and Simon. Do you two know what a Muscle Geek is?&quot;<br />
The two shook their heads in mute ignorance.<br />
<br />
&quot;The short answer is that it's a person with the mind of a geek and the body of a jock. Statistically, they're the most successful individuals you're likely to find. They have the social and team-building skills that jocks learn on the sports field, and the intelligence that only a geek can bring to bear. Simon, how about a compromise? We'll make you a Muscle Geek, fold the useful bits of Brandon's personality into your own. You'll still be a 4.0 student and captain of the Mathletes, but you'll also be captain of the Football team. That'll tickle Coach James pink, I'm sure. And to top it all off, you'll be Allison's perfect man. A studly nerd. Well, what'dya say?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two new lovers gazed soulfully into each other's eyes, corny as that sounds. A smile spread slowly across each of their faces. Simon turned back to Matthew.<br />
&quot;You've got a deal!&quot;<br />
Matthew beamed at them, and whipped out the pocket watch once more.<br />
&quot;Simon, go to sleep.&quot;<br />
Simon went into trance on command.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to my words, and know that they are true. You are a Muscle Geek. Your name is once more Simon Gregory. Your best jock friend, growing up, was Mark Jackson, and your best geek friend was his one-year-older brother Walter Jackson. You are the captain of the Mathletes and of the Football team. Under your leadership, the Jocks have won state championship after state championship, and so they follow your example and are kind to your fellow geeks. Your features are those you woke up with this morning, blended slightly with those of Brandon Star. This makes you look a bit like Brendan Star, your vice-captain of the Football team. You both suspect you might be related to each other, and you treat each other like brothers. Still, while he is pure jock, you are very much a Geek, who just happens to be muscular and enjoy sports. You've noticed in the showers that your penis and that of Mark are remarkably, even uncannily, similar. There are some differences, though. Your balls hang a little lower, and you have a bit more girth. When I snap my fingers, all of this will become true. And, as already established and agreed to by your own free will, you and Allison are deeply in love, though that shouldn't change anything. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ye...es...&quot;<br />
Matthew looked at Allison and grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bibbidi..&quot;<br />
He raised his hand.<br />
&quot;...Bobbidi...&quot;<br />
He brought his fingers together.<br />
&quot;...BOO!&quot;<br />
*SNAP!*<br />
<br />
The changes were gradual. First, Simon's hair became a mousy brown again, and then his face softened a bit, becoming less lantern-jawed, taking on what Matthew, as an Anime Fan, thought of as 'Bishounen' look. Other than that, his face was unchanged. Matthew and Allison were surprised, Matthew scientifically and Allison VERY happily, to discover that Simon was actually GAINING muscle. His arms expanded another inch, and his pecs ballooned a bit more, jutting now about a half a foot from his body.<br />
Matthew glanced at Allison and was quickly able to determine that 1) she liked what she saw, and 2) either her bra was very thin, or had been left at home today.<br />
As Simon's thighs thickened, his scrotum descended about 2cm. However, the readily noticeable change to the watcher was that his growing erection had thickened by about 2in. Allison looked as if she would faint from joy.<br />
Finally, as Simon went up another half a shoe size, the change was complete. He opened his eyes and looked lovingly on Allison.<br />
&quot;Hello, my love.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled fiercely and jumped into his arms. Matthew harumphed loudly, however, before they could even kiss.<br />
&quot;It's 4:30. Class is long over. Maybe you two should head over to Simon's house to...get reacquainted?&quot;<br />
They both grinned at him, and rushed out.<br />
<br />
Matthew smiled, and slung the watch around like a yo-yo.<br />
&quot;You've been up all night listening for his drum, hoping that the righteous might just might just might just come. I heard the General whisper to his aide-de-camp 'Be watchful for Mohammed's lamp.' Oh but don't it make you wanna rock and roll, all night long, Mohammed's Radio. I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful on the radio, Mohammed's radio...&quot;<br />
Matthew chuckled, quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta love a happy ending.&quot;</p>
