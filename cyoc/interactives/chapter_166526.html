<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Fowler&#39;s are one of the cousins of the Williams, the mother is a daughter of one of the grandparents.  The four of them love this family get together as they live to play pranks on their cousins.  This tradition started when Eric and Jessica were young and got embarrassed too many times, now they take it to a new level and embarrass their family for fun.<br />
<br />
Jessica Fowler is 39 and a director in the local theatre, she has been attending these parties since she was a little girl.<br />
<br />
Eric Fowler is 40 and has been attending since he got married to Jessica.  He thought it was awkward at first but ever since Jessica convinced him to not take it seriously he has a blast every year.  Eric is a professional comedian.<br />
<br />
Eve is 15 and has been attending since she was born, she loves the party and loves being her cousins.  She is an aspiring makeup artist.<br />
<br />
The youngest is Quinn who is only 6, he has found some very creative ways to prank his cousins.<br />
<br />
The Fowler family arrived, Eric was busy unloading their car while Jessica was greeting everyone with Eve and Quinn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica! What do you have planned for my poor family this year!&quot;. Her Grandfather greeted Jessica with a hug, he always found her antics hilarious even if he had been subject to them from time to time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Wouldn&#39;t you like to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve, how have you been&quot; Eve was staring at her phone and shrugged. &quot;You know school and stuff, are any of the other kids here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah just in the other room&quot; He looked at Quinn<br />
<br />
&quot;Quinn, you&#39;re looking very festive&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just finished our Christmas play&quot;. Quinn liked to perform in his Mother&#39;s children plays.  He was still wearing the costume from the play, a reindeer outfit with jingle bells and attached mitts and booties to look like hooves.  “Look it jingles.”  Quinn danced a little and all the bells rang.<br />
<br />
“Haha, good stuff lad.  Go find the others”  Quinn ran off with Eve to find the other kids.<br />
<br />
Jessica helped Eric unload the bags and grabbed all the gifts.  She handed all the gifts with their clothes to her Grandfather.  “These two are the kids, and these ones are ours.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Jessica, why don’t you two go on ahead”<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before everyone had gathered at the table.  Some people were laughing at some of the pranks the Fowler&#39;s had pulled in the past.  Eric was telling jokes and getting some laughs.<br />
<br />
After some time the festivities started, it started with the kids first.  Eve was selected after Robbie, she went and selected a blue gift bag.  She was secretly hoping to get Dylan, she had never been able to get him before and they had been playing this game together for 12 years now.  She went over to the changing room and unwrapped the blue gift.<br />
<br />
She pulled out some small flannel pajamas and T-Shirt, it looked like pajamas for an 8 year old boy.  “Oh these must be Robbie’s”.  She was fine with that and was able to change and slip them on.  She dropped her old clothes on the shelf and made her entrance. She was wearing her school uniform, a skirt and dress shirt with a tie.<br />
<br />
Eve, now Robby, power slides out of the change room and stopped right in front of the table.  She got cheers and claps from everyone.  She skipped back to the kids table.<br />
<br />
“Ha, Robby looks like I got you!”  Eve gloated, she really liked this time of year.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s cool Eve.”  Robbie smiled at her.<br />
<br />
Ryan went soon after, a 10 year old boy from the opposite side of the family.  He went off to the changing room with his gift.  He came back out as Eve decked out in her punk outfit she wore to a concert earlier that year.  He was clearly a little uncomfortable but did an awkward air guitar to make himself seem cool, all the adults cheered.  Ryan then sat back down.<br />
<br />
“Oh Ryan, be prepared for a fun week!”<br />
<br />
Ryan gulped. He had actually gotten Eve before and knew she could be quite the prankster to whoever gets her body.<br />
<br />
“Just go easy on me, okay.”<br />
<br />
“Not a chance” Eve retorted.<br />
<br />
Quinn was the next to go, he ran to grab a present and everyone heard his little bells jingle.  He picked a small green one and ran off to the changing room.  <br />
<br />
“Do you want some help changing Quinn?” His Grandmother asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, please” Quinn smiled.<br />
<br />
He unwrapped the gift, the gloves made it a little difficult but he managed.  He pulled out a unicorn T-Shirt and some jeans, the outfit looked like it would fit him just fine.<br />
<br />
“Oh it looks like I got Lori!”<br />
<br />
“Here let me get the zipper on your costume”<br />
<br />
His grandma unzipped him.  “No clothes under the costume, not even some underwear?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, that’s part of my prank this year…”<br />
<br />
His Grandma laughed.  “Okay I see you have it from here” She folded his costume and set it on the shelf and left.<br />
<br />
Quinn quickly changed and placed his hand on the stone.  Now he was fully Lori, he walked out and gave his best Lori impression.  He got claps and cheers and went to sit back down.<br />
<br />
“Haha, Quinn got me” Lori exclaimed, the two of them were pretty close since they were only a year apart.<br />
<br />
Quinn laughed, “I was hoping to be older”<br />
<br />
Troy was the next to pick, he knew from earlier Lori had already gotten him.  He selected one of the larger gifts, hoping to get one of the older kids and went to the changing room.  He went inside and moaned, he had actually gotten Quinn, someone who is half his age and loved playing pranks with his clothing choices.  Everyone has their own style, but Quinn always packs the most embarrassing stuff.  Troy pulled out a Christmas costume, the Pink Bunny Suit from “A Christmas Story”.  He put it on and transformed, leaving the rest of his clothes behind.<br />
<br />
He came out of the change room and made his best impression from the movie.  All the adults were laughing as they saw Troy, who was now Quinn, in his cute Pink Bunny Suit.<br />
<br />
Troy walked over to the kids table.  “Quinn, what the hell”<br />
<br />
Quinn started giggling in his girly voice and couldn’t stop.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, you better have SOMETHING normal to wear.” Troy had never gotten Quinn before and didn’t know what to expect.<br />
<br />
The rest of the kid’s changes went by ending with Kenny getting Dylan.</p>
