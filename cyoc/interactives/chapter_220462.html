<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah sat patiently in her hotel room, along with the rest of her team. While the mission to rescue Chenoa and her parents was successful, their superiors wished to meet with them. Sarah now wondered just how much trouble they were all in. &quot;Any idea what the bosses want,&quot; Dave asked. Sarah shrugged, despite being in charge they had left her completely in the dark. <br />
<br />
As the door to her hotel room now opened, Sarah and her team stood at attention. A confused look crossing her face as Director Franco entered with Jacob Moreland and a priest. &quot;Special Agent McMillan,&quot; Franco stated. &quot;Pleasure to meet you. Please be seated.&quot; Sarah and the others nodded, gazing at the man as he began to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you&#39;ve already met Mr. Moreland,&quot; Franco said, pointing to Jacob. &quot;Allow me to introduce you to Archbishop Castiglione from Vatican City.&quot; The Archbishop now offered a polite wave as Sarah and the others responded. &quot;Sir,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;My team and I understand that this operation is to be classified. We&#39;re ready to return to Langley and can assure you that confidentiality will be maintained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary agent,&quot; Franco stated, causing Sarah to pause. &quot;The return to Langley that is not the confidentiality part. I&#39;ll allow the Archbishop to explain.&quot; Franco now stepped to the side, allowing the Archbishop to step forward. Studying the man she was surprised to see he appeared to be Jacob&#39;s age, his dark hair neatly kept with the sides completely grey. Sarah was curious as to why the man was dressed so casually, sporting a button down shirt and a pair of khakis. What puzzled her even more was the accent he spoke with. It was Italian but it was more of a New York Italian accent as opposed to an actual Italian accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent McMillan,&quot; the Archbishop smiled. &quot;It appears you have quite accidentally stumbled upon something that myself and my friend Jacob have tried to keep quiet for most of our lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies Archbishop,&quot; Sarah stated. The Archbishop simply smiled, waving of Sarah&#39;s concerns politely. &quot;Its quite alright Agent McMillan and please, call me Pete.&quot; Sarah nodded, allowing Pete to finish what he had to say. &quot;As I was saying you may have stumbled upon this secret but, your actions have shown that perhaps the American government should take a more hands on approach when dealing with the supernatural.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry a more hands on approach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re developing a test agency Agent McMillan,&quot; Franco stated. &quot;Strategic Paranormal Enforcement and Rescue or S.P.E.A.R. for short and we want you to act as it&#39;s director. Right here in this area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With Mr. Moreland acting as your advisor,&quot; Pete added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold up Pete I didn&#39;t sign up for this,&quot; Jacob protested. &quot;I&#39;m retired remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Jacob but I&#39;ve been talking with Nina,&quot; Pete replied. &quot;And she tells me you&#39;ve been bored to tears since the boys took over. I&#39;m not asking you to go back in the field just act as the agencies paranormal expert. Answer any questions that they have. If this program is successful we&#39;ll be modeling it for other countries around the world. Let&#39;s face it, considering what happened three years ago, we could use the help.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And the federal government would compensate you for your service Mr. Moreland,&quot; Franco added. Jacob sighed, nodding as he looked to his old friend Pete. &quot;Fine Pete but you owe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its settled then,&quot; Franco stated, a small grin spreading across his face as he shook Sarah&#39;s hand. &quot;Congratulations Director McMillan. As head of S.P.E.A.R. you&#39;ll be reporting to me and me only.&quot; Sarah&#39;s jaw dropped, thanking Director Franco for the promotion.<br />
<br />
As the others now spoke about Sarah&#39;s duties as well as the sphere of influence S.P.E.A.R would have, Michelle found herself thinking of Duchess Jenkins. What the young agent had not told her superiors was her knowledge of the missing former policewoman. Duchess Jenkins was the elder sister of Michelle college roommate.<br />
<br />
Wanda Jenkins, Duchess little sister and Michelle&#39;s best friend, had been beside herself with grief since her sister&#39;s disappearance. At the time Michelle thought there was little she could do to help the only true friend she had in the world. Growing up hadn&#39;t been easy for Michelle. Even when she went away to college is was difficult to make friends. That is until she found herself as a roommate to Wanda. Wanda was an energetic breath of fresh air to introverted Michelle. For the first time Michelle found herself opening up to someone, actually feeling accepted as a friend. When she heard about Duchess disappearance and that they would be investigating the town she had disappeared in, Michelle hoped to give her friend some news about her big sister. Now, with her agency officially dealing with the supernatural, Michelle hoped to make contact with Duchess and help her best friend find peace.<br />
<br />
************************************<br />
<br />
As the school year ended, Miles now found himself sitting on his front steps strumming his guitar. It had certainly been an interesting year, that much was certain. The only downside, he was still without a girlfriend.<br />
<br />
While not entirely true, he did find himself single currently. Although it appeared Chenoa would be attending school in the fall, her family was traveling this summer. This meant the pair could only communicate via email, text, and the occasional phone call meaning he would only hear from the girl once or twice a day. Still, considering he had saved Chenoa from an attack, her parents did adore him.<br />
<br />
Another sour note was having his driver&#39;s license yet not being able to drive. Miranda was borrowing the car to go on dates with Amara, and Miles found himself at home either playing music or training as a hunter. &quot;Could be worse,&quot; he sighed. Gazing across the street, he watched he&#39;d as a moving van now began to unload various boxes. The house across the street had been up for sale for a few months, Miles curious about the family who had purchased it. So far he had yet to see who they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey be careful with that one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles turned, his jaw dropping as he stared at beautiful ebony haired teen. The teenage girl looked around his age and was currently sporting a rather sour look. As she rushed towards the movers, all they could offer was a meek apology. &quot;Sorry kid,&quot; one of then stated meekly. Obviously the girl didn&#39;t like being referred to as kid, Miles noting her cheeks flush red with anger. &quot;Its fine,&quot; huffed. &quot;Just be careful with that one. It has a....special suit inside.&quot; The mover simply nodded, once more trying to move the heavy crate inside. <br />
<br />
Miles was now curious, who was this girl and what was she doing moving into his neighborhood? Also, where were her parents? It didn&#39;t seem to make any sense that they wouldn&#39;t be around. Standing from the steps, the teen now called out, offering a timid wave as he approached.<br />
<br />
Stephanie Marsh pause, her eyes going wide in fright as she saw the teenage boy approach. The last thing she wanted was to run into anyone her age or well more accurately her new age. Silently she cursed her rotten luck. A month ago she had been celebrating her birthday with Ann and Jackie. She was moving quickly through the ranks of the corporate boardroom, becoming its youngest member. She had money, prestige, power but, she was lacking in one area.<br />
<br />
Stephanie wasn&#39;t getting any younger, or at least without Ann and Jackie&#39;s assistance. Forty was closing fast and Steph was beginning to want to settle down and start a family. The only problem was finding someone, most guys her age were already married. Feeling down, she eventually found herself inside a Magic Shop.  Not the one owned by Merlin but a different, perhaps less reputable one in one of the shadier parts Time Square. That was how she had found the wishing machine. <br />
<br />
It was a stupid wish. After breaking up with yet another awful boyfriend, Steph was feeling rather low. Dropping a quarter in, she wished she could find a love like she did the first time. What she got instead was deaged into a 16 year old version of herself. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Steph, the power if this wishing machine was so potent that not even Jackie could break the spell. For all intents and purposes like, Steph was stuck having to relive her life again, starting at Sixteen. At least this time though, she had plenty of money to cover her expenses and was able to find a place where she could be by herself. This was how she now found herself in Jackie&#39;s hometown, right across the street from Miles Desoto.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um hey,&quot; Steph said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; Miles stated, offering an awkward wave to the teen. &quot;You just move in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I just like yelling at random movers as a hobby,&quot; Steph replied sarcastically, immediately regretting coming across as so bitchy. The kid in front of her seemed decent enough to come and say hello, it wasn&#39;t his fault she was stuck as a teenager. &quot;Um sorry,&quot; she replied meekly. &quot;Yeah, just moved in today. I&#39;m Steph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miles. Where you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New York.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh cool,&quot; Miles replied. &quot;But bummer too, it&#39;s gotta suck leaving your old school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Junior year is not something I&#39;m looking forward to,&quot; Steph sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m going to be a Junior too,&quot; Miles replied happily. &quot;Is that your car? Your folks must be rich.&quot; Steph glanced at her Mercedes, giggling as Miles stared wide eyed at the car. If she had to be a teenager again, at least she had a cool car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey listen,&quot; Steph stated. &quot;I got to finish unpacking but are you busy later?&quot; Miles shook his head no,  Steph smiling as she now took the opportunity to write her number down for Miles. &quot;Why don&#39;t you give me a call in a few hours, maybe we can hangout.&quot; Miles nodded, a goofy grin on his face as Steph turned back towards the movers. Hopefully this second chance at teendom wouldn&#39;t be as awful as the last time.</p>
