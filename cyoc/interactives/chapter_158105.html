<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The family, new clothing, new bodies.<br />
<br />
To kick off the new round, everybody in the family began to change. Thomas, to add to his height, grew a little. Not a lot however, he was now 15 years old.<br />
Alice changed next, she changed suddenly to become 17 years old. She was now the eldest child of the two. Beating her brother in all aspects, considering they were both girls.<br />
Brian changed as well, instead of growing however, he shrunk. He shrunk smaller, he was now the same age as his daughter... I mean son. Thomas easily beating his height especially since he had just shrunk smaller. He looked down and saw that his clothes were a little too small on him.<br />
Rachael changed last, age watched her ft hands wrinkle more. She felt herself shrink a little, her hair shimmered from slightly grey on jet black hair, to slightly black hair on silvery grey hair. She watched as her severely overinflated water balloon breasts began to sag further and further. Luckily grasping onto that last bit youth before they sagged lower than any hope. Still luckily supported mostly by her massive bra.<br />
Rachael changed in another aspect too. She watched as her belly grew larger, inflating bigger and bigger. The saggy chins on her face filled up larger. Her legs squished even further together. Her body growing even fatter.<br />
<br />
Rachaels turn was first, she managed to throw the dice. Her piece moved. She attempted to reach over to the card pile, she failed, as she anticipated she would. Thomas grabbed his mother’s card for her. She took it and heaved her giant arm up to read it,<br />
“The players tongue will become larger,”<br />
Rachael opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue, the family watched as it grew longer. Until it reached the bottom of her chin (which was already engorged enough). Rachael’s body expanded once more. More fat adding to her. Her breasts still the most noticeable feature on her by a long shot. But she was growing fatter by each turn.<br />
<br />
Brian was next, he rolled and picked up a card. He cleared his throat. His voice was higher pitched,<br />
“The players feet will grow larger,”<br />
Brian felt a pressure in his shoes, he watched as they burst through, breaking out the front of them. His feet were already fairly large so this was a significant change.<br />
However, with Rachael waiting for her fat change. She didn’t notice her feet changing a lot. They burst through her shoes, tearing them to pieces. She wondered, maybe they would be able to support her weight, not that she could check, being trapped in her chair.<br />
Her body grew once more, without warning, she felt her jeans rip down her thighs.<br />
<br />
Thomas went next, typical throwing dice and picking up a card,<br />
<br />
“Choose a player (including yourself) to lose all previous changes. Return to square one.”<br />
<br />
The room went silent. Thomas now had a dilemma. He wanted to be a boy again, so very bad. But he knew his mother was in literal agony in her situation.<br />
<br />
He made the decision,<br />
<br />
“Fix mom,”<br />
<br />
The family gasped. They didn’t expect that.<br />
<br />
“Tom, if could could move right now, I’d give you the biggest hug.”<br />
Before Thomas had any time to respond, a card shot out from the deck. Rachael managed to grab it. She read it,<br />
<br />
“Cheaters should never get their way, but the player has chosen you. In return for cheating and keeping the game fair; you will retain the punishment changes (apart from the age changes).“<br />
<br />
Rachael smiled for the first time since in a while.<br />
<br />
Everybody watched as her hair shortened again. Her eyes changed colour.<br />
Her body youthened again. Her breasts seemed to rise again, like balloons being pumped up with more air. She returned to her normal age.<br />
Her belly began to shrink. Disappearing again. Her thighs, arms, chin(s). All normal again.<br />
The only thing left was her smile... also black hair, big feet, and giant breasts and ass.<br />
<br />
She got herself up from her chair, for the first time in the game. Her clothing was far to big for her, but she could finally move again.<br />
Her breasts were the size of her torso, each. She arched her back over, having trouble standing upright. Her Butt helped balance herself out. Her butt was bigger than anyone had ever seen. Putting even Alice to shame. She would have looked at her massive feet but couldn’t actually see them over her gargantuan assets. She sat herself down again.<br />
<br />
“Well. Alice. Your turn!” She said, gleefully.<br />
<br />
Alice rolled and picked up a card,<br />
“Player’s waist gets smaller,”<br />
<br />
Alice watched as her waist shrank.</p>
