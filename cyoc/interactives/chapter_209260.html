<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first place I needed to go on my list was not the computer club. Unfortunately, Vargruf was ordering me over to the Mining guild. If I remembered correctly, other races had excellent mining skills as well. Kobolds, Dao (Djinn from the earthen planes), Sapphire Dragonborn, Formians (Ant People whose mines were intricate), Deep Gnomes (Mostly gems, as that was their speciality). Of course, dwarves were better-stronger, honourable and master crafters. I smiled, fingering my new clan pin.<br />
<br />
With a heavy sigh and a final look back at Martin, my steadfast friend, I walked down the hall, further into the clanhold. It was like the real world and the game were leaking together-first I saw the wiring and plumbing of a school, a few sewer pipes crossing overhead. But the tunnel kept sloping down, and the man-made structures disappeared, becoming hand-carved stone.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the tunnel opened into a large cavern-maybe a hundred and fifty feet in circumference. Not big by the standards of Reborn Venture, but sizeable in real life. I clumped along in my oversized boots and scratched an itch on my chest as I took it in. The area was like a smaller version of Kharn-Adan, another smithing area in the center of the cavern with little homes carved in a circle around it. Side passages branched off it like the spokes of a wagon wheel.<br />
<br />
It was really cool. There were more dwarves milling about, hammering at anvils and baking goods and brewing beers. I could smell roasted meat and wondered how the hell Vargruf had managed to start a small economy below the school. The VR overlay was messing with me even without a headset-I could see a much grander plan in the works here, just from the way the dwarves were working the stone.<br />
<br />
If Vargruf had enough resources, I was fairly certain he could literally recreate Kharn-Adan. And for some reason, the idea was making me giddy. I barely felt the squeeze of the bracelet as it sent happy hums through my mind. If I stuck around, I could be a part of his great endeavor. What could more could a dwarf like me ask for?<br />
<br />
The force of the bracelet squeezing my wrist and shoving serotonin into my veins at the last thought was enough for me to gain clarity even through the heady rush of happiness I was feeling. I wasn’t a dwarf, I was just a clansman. The bracelet sent another wave of pleasure through me and I had to steady myself against the wall. If I hadn’t known better, I might have given in right there!<br />
<br />
Before, I’d had some resistance to it. Now, with the crack repaired, I could feel my defenses slipping, coaxed non-too-subtly away by the pleasant sensations and strange thoughts the bracelet was injecting into my stream of conscious. It was truly devious. I really needed to hurry and finish Vargruf’s work orders so I could get to the computer club, because my cock was hard and leaking into my shorts.<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, I got hold of myself and went to the tunnel with the mine-cart logo. If this was Kharn-Adan, then that was the fast travel to the miner’s guild. Dwarves passed by and gave me cordial grunts, eyes going to my pin. When I reached the cart, it was packed full of dwarves in top-quality miner’s gear. However, the cart attendant took on look at my pin and ordered a few dwarves off.<br />
<br />
They grumbled but saw my pin and their eyes widened. The dwarves stepped aside with deference and I boarded in their place. Clearly, they took Vargruf’s clan sigil pin seriously. I smiled and nodded in thanks, feeling the bracelet tighten, a thrill of joy shooting through me, but ignored it. When I got in, I ground the cart door close, forcing me tight with the other-with the dwarves. I stood about a foot taller than them, so I felt a bit out of place.<br />
<br />
As the cart rumbled down the tracks and passed into a pitch-black tunnel, I felt a few discrete pinches on my bottom, and more than one thick hand groped my shorts. I shifted, trying to keep away from the hands, but they didn’t relent. The darkness of the tunnel didn’t allow me to see who my paramours were. There was a tightness on my wrist, and I found myself relaxing into the gropes, moaning softly.<br />
<br />
A bearded mouth found its way to mine and we began making out. I felt my belt being tugged loose and my shorts dropped around my ankles. I gasped into the kiss as a thick, spit-wetted digit dug its way into my hole and a furry mouth wrapped itself around my hard cock. The kisser relented and I found my head being pressed further down until the heat and whiff of musk indicated a thick cock in front of me.<br />
<br />
I wanted to protest, but my wrist was squeezing rhythmically alongside the bobs of the dwarf suckling on my cock. The hand was insistent and I felt so good that I just opened my mouth and let the thick, veiny cock in. Behind me, the thick digit withdrew, leaving my hole cold and empty. It was quickly replaced by a big, throbbing cock. It rubbed between my cheeks, slicking my hole with precum, before I was gripped by wide, meaty hands and the cock forced itself into me. My breath wheezed out around the luscious cock in my mouth.<br />
<br />
It felt so tight, so uncomfortable, but then it slid past something inside me that made fireworks of pleasure burst in my mind. It was all too much, I couldn’t take it anymore. With a grunt, a felt my cock spasm into the eager bearded mouth.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the clan, lad.” A rough voice whispered in my ear.<br />
<br />
“Got a good mouth on ya, clansman,” A gruff voice above me said.<br />
<br />
A hot wave of pride rolled from the pin on my chest with an answering throb from the bracelet on my wrist. I moaned, bobbing eagerly, pressing my ass back against the intruding cock and clenching my hole around his thick dick. My spine was popping painlessly and I found myself having to bend less and less to suck the dwarf’s dick.<br />
<br />
The cocks in my mouth and ass were more resilient than I, and I found myself being thrust back and forth on them. The dwarf on my cock hadn’t stopped sucking either, and I expected the familiar over-sensitive sensations to make me uncomfortable, but they never came. Instead, I found myself orgasming again and again, my other lovers flooding my insides with warmth, the cum in my mouth tasting very much like mead, which I eagerly swallowed.<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, the light of the end of the tunnel appeared. My group quickly broke apart, and I found someone pulling my shorts back up and cinching my belt.  A few last minute gropes and a kiss from my hidden lover happened just as the carts exited the tunnel. I blinked at the light, vision blurry. Around me, I was aware of the smell of heavy musk and several most of the dwarves had rumpled and disheveled uniforms. Cum was leaking from my ass and lips and my crotch was soaked, but I felt good.<br />
<br />
I smiled happily, fingering my pin, and saw a few other small smiles on the handsome faces of the dwarves around me before the platform approached and they cleaned themselves off and assumed their usual stern expressions. Following their example, I straightened myself up and smoothed my own uniform out, acting as though the best sex I’d ever had didn’t just occur a few seconds ago. Strangely, I no longer towered over the other dwarves, we were all practically the same height.<br />
<br />
The mining guild was right next to a large tavern that had been hewn into the stone. I wondered where I was in comparison to the school, but realized that it didn’t matter. Maybe it was the bracelet on my wrist, gently squeezing me, or the cooling cum in my ass, but the way reality and Reborn Venture were blending together didn’t bother me much anymore.<br />
<br />
Crossed Pickaxes over a pile of gems and gold were the guild’s insignia. Outside, a few dwarves and kobolds were smoking pipes and chatting quietly to themselves, steins of ale in their hands. Being right next to a pub must be nice. The warmth of the torches and the honey-colored glow from the dull glass windows gave the whole place a homely feel. Dwarven cities were cozy that way.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me.” I said, voice cracking as it dropped an octave. “You boys don’t happen to know where...’Keely Macintire’ is?”<br />
<br />
“The guild master?” One of the dwarves eyed my pin. “Oh, a Courier. Guess they didn’t program you right. He’s in there.” The dwarf jabbed a thumb behind him.<br />
<br />
I nodded my thanks and walked through the heavy wooden double doors into the Miner’s Guild HQ.</p>
