<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, Lyle was returning Gregg’s body. He gave Jim a kiss goodbye at the hotel, and thanked him for a the nice fuck of his formerly-virgin straight guy ass. When he arrives at Gregg’s house, he was greeted by Penelope, Gregg, and his boyfriend Alex. He told them how he was done and had had his fun, because being in another person’s body is a once in a lifetime opportunity. His boyfriend forgave him and said he probably would have done the same if he was in a different body for a day. Penelope and Gregg were pissed, but still ready to get this all behind them with a switch back.<br />
<br />
“I talked with Lightbulb Lab customer service, and they told me this problem sometimes happens when people are playing using an avatar of another in-system player’s skin design. So that means you were messing around as me before you ever got back to the real world...” said Gregg, accusatively.<br />
<br />
“So I did. You were the only other male form logged in the new Hexaprobe. I just was curious what if felt like to be a different man, and you would have done the same if the system had had a woman’s real life avatar logged. You have to admit that super model skin ‘estimated’ avatar wasn’t as realistic as our full scan avatars,” said Lyle.<br />
<br />
“Well I hope you enjoyed my detailed virtual body, you pervert!” Exclaimed Gregg.<br />
<br />
“I did. But strictly speaking, I enjoyed your real life body even more,” taunted Lyle.<br />
<br />
“Whatever, let’s just switch back. Customer service said both body swapped parties need to log in and request a ‘deep memory scan’ which will scan our chemical memories in our real life brains and cross reference them with our digitally uploaded consciousnesses to ensure we log out as our original selves,” explained Gregg.<br />
<br />
Lyle agreed, even though he wanted to have more sex in Gregg’s body. He figured he was lucky enough to have gotten away with it once. The two men logged in and requested a deep memory scan and within one minute they were back in the real world, in their original bodies.<br />
<br />
“Finally! I’m big and strong again,” said Gregg, joyfully.<br />
<br />
Lyle looked in his pants and saw his bigger penis, “nice to have you back sir.”<br />
<br />
Just then, Gregg’s good friend, Calvin came in without knocking. This was the usual for their friendship. Calvin was big and muscular like Gregg, but also more on the smooth side, just hair on his nipples and pubes. The hair on his head was light blonde and short, his face clean shaven.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey Lyle, hey Alex,” said Calvin, “hey what the fuck, is that the new Hexaprobe?! Can I play it?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, but I don’t feel like it,” said Gregg with an ominous laugh. <br />
<br />
“I do,” said Lyle, eager to try out another man’s body.<br />
<br />
Calvin thought nothing of this and handed Lyle one of the helmets. Alex and Penelope had already moved to the other room before playing arrangements were made. Lyle and Calvin logged in, and within five minutes, Calvin had made his avatar some female pornstar he had pulled off of google. Lyle waited for Calvin to leave the waiting room before he changed his avatar to Calvin’s original beefy avatar. He then logged out while thinking, “I’m Calvin, I’m Calvin, I’m Calvin...”<br />
<br />
Next thing he knew, Lyle was waking up as a much bigger body. He was 6’1” and had less body fat than Gregg. Lyle started to rub up his new body when he felt eyes on him.<br />
<br />
“Let me guess, Lyle?” Asked Gregg, who was still in the living room, watching his best friend’s body feel itself up with a new consciousness in the driver’s seat.<br />
<br />
“You caught me, but I really don’t care. An audience just makes this more exciting,” said Lyle who got up and started to strip. He discovered a very ripped and large football player’s body, with out much hair. Although Calvin had never done steroids, his junk was embarrassingly small. He had a 2 inch penis that stood 4 inches erect, and had no big balls to compensate. Being embarrassed about his new small genitals made him very hard.<br />
<br />
Gregg stirred uncomfortably, watching Lyle’s exploration, “What’s this feeling in my ass? What did you do to me?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well I did have a guy from the gay bar fuck your ass. It probably wants another pounding. That usually happens to me after a good fuck in my original body,” said Lyle.<br />
<br />
“So you’re saying you made my body gay?” Asked Gregg.<br />
<br />
“Well not exactly. I made your body crave penetration. We could lube up Calvin’s little penis here and satisfy your new needs?” Lyle offered.<br />
<br />
“I suppose if Calvin doesn’t wake up until after we fuck, he’ll never know I used his body for cock,” said Gregg, “I can’t believe I’m considering this, I don’t even like guys! But I just have this feeling like something would feel so good inside me.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a yes to me,” said Lyle, teasing his new himbo body’s nipples. <br />
<br />
Gregg led Lyle to his bedroom. Before long Gregg was on his back with his legs up, naked, with the most embarrassed expression on his stubbly face. Lyle lubed up the straight man’s ass pussy.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t hard for lyle to fully penetrate Gregg, but gregg still needed to get used to the pressure. After all, this was only his body’s second time being fucked. Lyle was patient and massaged Gregg’s hairy body, and sucked his manly tits until Gregg’s hole naturally loosened. Lyle was free to pump, as short as those pumps may have been with only a four inch erection, but he did so and he made the most out of little strokes. Gregg’s face was hot with pleasure. Soft moans were escaping his manly mouth. <br />
<br />
After a good long fuck, Gregg came out of his 4.5 inch erection, and his o-face made Lyle cum into his ass with Calvin’s little cock. The two made out for another ten minutes feeling the pulsating cock and rectum.<br />
<br />
“Okay before my wife and your boyfriend find out, we should get you back to your own body,” said Gregg.</p>
