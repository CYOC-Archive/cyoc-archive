<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Working in the circus wasn&#39;t as great as Adam expected. Well, he didn&#39;t expect to work at the circus in first place... but he had no choice but accept his current situation. Maybe the worst part was beign a moving mass of testosterone which means a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
First, it was the smell. It was with him everytime and everywhere he went. Sometimes he liked to work with the animals because they stunk worse than him, or at least they could hide his smell a little. At first, he tried to stay as clean as possible, however it was difficult to hide his musky aroma without deodorant or a good soap. So, at the end he gave up.<br />
<br />
Then, another problem very related to the previous one was sweating. Adam sweats a lot, and maybe those words aren&#39;t enough to describe how much he sweats. The circus has a few tents and cars, but those are for the performers and people more important than him. Adam was under the sun almost all day. So, sweating was normal. And if that wasn&#39;t a big enough problem, he didn&#39;t have too many clothes. He also didn&#39;t have a washing machine. So, he ended up wearing his dirty clothes more often than he wanted it. Sometimes, when the smell and dirtiness in his clothes are too much, he takes his shirt off and works shirtless (a few times even pantless). But he was so ashamed of his third problem that he didn&#39;t do that too often.<br />
<br />
And it&#39;s because his third problem was his body hair. Normally, this isn&#39;t a problem for a man, when a man grows up as usual. But Adam wasn&#39;t a normal man, he was a boy a few weeks ago. A boy with any hair except on his head. Now, he was as hairy as a bear or an ape. Sometimes, people makes jokes like that about him when he&#39;s working near the animals. He has been bullied because of his body hair since day one. So, it&#39;s obvious that he didn&#39;t feel comfortable with it. Plus, he didn&#39;t have access to any razor or shaving machine, so he had some difficulties trying to trim his hirsute beard with a knife. Maybe, only the bearded lady had a larger beard than him now.<br />
<br />
So, if we resume it. Adam has a lot of troubles dealing with his smell, sweat and body hair. But testosterone means something more than that and Adam didn&#39;t like to talk or think about it. It&#39;s pretty ironic how a small and confident boy can become a very shy and ashamed man when he got big. There are few people who can see at Adam&#39;s eyes without looking up and there are even less people who can have a chance fighting against him. He was big, pretty big. His muscles were so huge and thick that they looked like rocks. Well, when if you can see them, because there wasn&#39;t a piece of Adam&#39;s skin who wasn&#39;t covered in hair.<br />
<br />
To support that amount of muscles, Adams needed strong legs and he had a thick pair of those. His legs were so big, that they rub each other continuosly when he walked. But the real problem when he walked were his feet. His clown size feet. After describing his other problems, you can imagine how Adam&#39;s feet look. That&#39;s right, big, hairy, smelly and sweaty. If the circus needs a new freak, he could be the new sasquatch or bigfoot, and he knew it. He was totally disgusted of them and usually he tried to hide them from anyone&#39;s sight, but at the same he liked to touched them when they&#39;re warm or put his sausage fingers between his sausage toes. He felt pretty ashamed when he did things like that but he kept doing it anyway. He didn&#39;t want to admit it, or maybe he doesn&#39;t even know it, but he had a big foot fetish.<br />
<br />
Adam was the epitome of manliness, even if he didn&#39;t wish for it. However, he was so embarrassed and ashamed of himself so often that he can&#39;t be seen as an alpha male by the other circus&#39; staff. He was submissive, maybe a bottom if he would have sex. But he didn&#39;t want to see his own body, even less he wanted to be seen naked by someone else. But he has needs, basic needs for any man and he wasn&#39;t a exception. So, when it was very late or when he was sure that nobody was seeing him, he unzipped his old dirty jeans and released his meat. The true freak.<br />
<br />
People didn&#39;t need to watch it outside his pants to know that Adam was hung like a horse, or even more. It&#39;s so obvious that just seeing Adam could be described as obsecenity. He can&#39;t do anything about it or maybe just thank for having pants with pouches so big that didn&#39;t constrict him. When he was a boy, he didn&#39;t think too much about it, but now that he was an adult, a very endowed adult, he got a repulsive feeling towards bouncing. His balls bounced, his dick bounced, sometimes he even thinks that they&#39;re alive and they&#39;re making fun of him too.<br />
<br />
It would be a dream for thousands of men to get a body like Adam&#39;s, but for him it was a curse, literally. He avoid to see himself in any mirror or water surface and each night he went to sleep crying because his legs can fit in his small bed. He was constantly tormented by those who know that he was a bratty city boy and now he was almost a slave who has less than a penny in his pockets. He frequently thought about his future, what will happen to him. Will he stay there forever? He could try to escape but what will he do then? Looking for a job? He doesn&#39;t finish high school and all his former skill were lost when he got over 200 pounds of muscle. What kind of job do muscle men have? Bodybuilder is a job? Maybe a wrestler or a football player, but he doesn&#39;t have any experience with those sports. Then he looked down and noticed the fat salami swaying free between his legs. Ladies like big penises, right? He could become a stripper or a porn star. He needed experience for that?<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and slept wishing that tomorrow would be a better day.</p>
