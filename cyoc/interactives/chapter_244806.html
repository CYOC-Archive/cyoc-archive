<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan wracked her brain, trying to figure out why they got divorced, when suddenly it came to her.  How could she forget about Cindy, her hot 25-year old neighbor?<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
David had found out about her affair with Cindy, finding it both shocking and disgusting.  For one, his wife would never, <i>could</i> never cheat on him, yet she had.  But it wasn&#39;t with another man.  It was with a woman!  He had no idea she was such a pervert!  He thought that she was a fairly moral and ethical person, growing up in the church and all.  But no!  All this time, she was nothing but a sexual deviant!  While it was true that there may have been signs of this, like her leaving the church when she moved out of her parents&#39; house before going to college, and her casual interest in the alternative lifestyle, as far as decor and clothing choices went, she still presented herself in a respectable way, in the public eye.  She was, after all, a lawyer.  And a mother.  So finding out that she was having regular sex with Cindy behind his back, for months ... well ... it made him re-evaluate his marriage to her.  He obviously couldn&#39;t trust her, not after this.  And now knowing that she was actually a lesbian, or at the very least, bisexual, he felt that he didn&#39;t really <i>know</i> her either.  He tried to find something about her that he still loved, but realized that he was only loving the woman he <i>thought</i> she was, instead of the woman she <i>actually</i> was.  Shortly later, they got a divorce, which was hard on their daughter Jennifer, but what could be done?  Their marriage was obviously over.<br />
<br />
After her affair with Cindy was discovered by David, Susan felt guilty, being found out, feeling that she had betrayed the man she had devoted her life to, til death do them part, and all that (even though Cindy was an incredible fuck).  But then she grew angry and insulted by David&#39;s reaction to her loving other women.  She expected him to be mad about the affair, but not about who she chose to do it with.  She had no idea he was so intolerant that he couldn&#39;t accept his own wife of being sexually attracted to women.  Just look at Cindy!  She was a totally hot babe!  Those curves, those tits, that round perfect ass.  How could she <i>not</i> have sex with someone like her?  And she was totally into it too!  That day when Susan started to flirt with her, Cindy just let it happen.  She didn&#39;t even feel guilty that she was having sex with a married woman!  Now if only she were more alternative, or even Goth or punk.  That would make things so much hotter.  Right now, she looked more like a bimbo than anything else.  Though, Susan wasn&#39;t complaining too much about that, of course.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately after David moved out, Cindy moved in.  They weren&#39;t married, but the two women shared the master bedroom, having tons of hot sex there, almost every day.  Cindy could be a real slut sometimes.  This new living arrangement couldn&#39;t have been better for Susan (and Cindy, of course, now living in a larger house), but Jennifer didn&#39;t like it.  She didn&#39;t like that her mom and dad had split up, and she didn&#39;t like Cindy.  Frankly, it was weird to be living in a house with a girl who was only about seven years older than her, someone who could be her older sister, but was sleeping with her mom instead.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
David walked into the master bedroom, intending on grabbing a few of his boxes full of stuff that he had left in there, but stopped suddenly when he saw his wife&#39;s lover Cindy lying naked on the bed.  He still couldn&#39;t believe that his wife ... er, ex-wife ... was with this woman.  She was 18 years younger!  She was young enough to be Susan&#39;s daughter!<br />
<br />
Cindy sat up and smiled at David, not embarrassed at all to be found in the nude.  She then began to rub her breasts and finger herself, all the while still smiling.  David couldn&#39;t help but stare.  What was <i>wrong</i> with this girl?  Had she no decency?  And <i>this</i> was who Susan had decided to spend the rest of her life with?  This slut?  This ... incredibly hot ... slut?</p>
