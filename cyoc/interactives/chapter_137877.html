<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well until they can figure out how to reverse these changes, the station thinks it’s better that we keep you three locked up here for the night,” said the German Shepherd wearing a police officer’s cap and a cover that said K9 UNIT. “How the animal shelter here doesn’t really understand what is going on just that this cell has been commended for police business and they promised not to interfere, but it is best you three don’t go about chatting when any employees are around. Just keep quiet and we will make this all easy for you.”<br />
<br />
The German Shepherd just a few days ago was a new 22 year old recruit to the force, though he did eventually want to join the K9 Unit this was not what he had in mind. Though now this was his case so he wanted to ensure he saw it through. His partners stood on either side of the hallway leading to this cell room to make sure random civilians didn’t notice a German Shepard talking to another dog, cat, and litter box all silent on the other side of the bars. This was the first time this town had to deal with a transformation based case but they have heard of such situations starting to become an issue in the big cities, so with much hope they would be able to solve this case within a week, especially as the dog on the case did not wish to be a German Shepherd much longer. The station had to tell his family he was out of down on another case yet in reality he had to sleep in the police station overnight and survive on canned dog food that was worse than the chow he had in academy. <br />
<br />
“You three cooperate then we will go easy on you and put this whole mess behind us, until then good night,” said the German Shepherd as he walked off with the two other officers. Behind the bars in a large cage meant for keeping run away pets the other German Shepherd and cat looked down angrily at the box of kitty litter placed between the two.<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked as I gave a nervous look. <br />
<br />
“This was your fault don’t what me,” barked Keith as he bared his teeth. <br />
<br />
“If you hadn’t played around with those keys none of us would be in this situation,” meowed Sam with a grumpy face. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I didn’t know, and honestly you two got the better end of the stick, at least you both could move about and not worry about being used to as bathroom,” I muttered with my sandy inside shifting about. <br />
<br />
“You know since there is no other little box here, when I need to go again I will make sure to use you out of spite,” said Sam the cat as he walked to the corner of the room.<br />
<br />
“Same,” said Keith. “It was bad enough having to be a pile of shit for almost an hour, hope you like how that feels when I add more to your dumb face.”<br />
<br />
I gave out a sigh. Not a good position to be in, a sentient, mostly immobile litter box between two angry animals. I tried shaking my body a bit to try and inch away to the back of the room which took a lot of effort and made a bit of noise but when I got to the back wall I just stopped to take a rest. <br />
<br />
Sam was still in the corner not talking while Keith started pacing back and forth near the door of the pen. I looked out at my reflection that I was able to make out from the light fixture hanging above. Sam had gone in me three more times since we were placed under arrest and now I felt much heavier than before. All that this added was more material to make up the features of my face with I was able to control and make expressions with. Mostly I was just making worried and nervous faces, while trying to hide the fact that I was made up of waste now which was a very gross thought. I was thankful I could not smell or taste in this form.<br />
<br />
Honestly I was very helpless, though I could slightly move and talk, anytime Sam or Keith climb inside me I instantly became immobile and unable to talk though I could still see and feel everything going on. As well anytime one of the animal shelter employees came about I had to force myself to remain silent. Though since I moved around the cell a lot I wonder what they made of the constantly shifting litter box of if they noticed at all. So far I haven’t been changed with fresh litter yet which was good I guess because I wasn’t sure what would happen to me, is the litter inside my box body part of my former self? Would I be able to change back if seperated? These were things I did not want to find out, and I guess the police didn’t want to risk as well since they did state to the animal shelter folks not to “tamper” with the evidence under any circumstances. <br />
<br />
As night drifted Keith made his way back to me and plopped down next to my side. An hour later so did Sam. We chatted a bit, all three of us forgetting we were fighting and for a few moments I forgot I was a talking litter box, that was until Sam decided to use me again. But I was getting used to it by now. <br />
<br />
The other two eventually fell asleep but I was tossing and turning all night, I guess inanimate objects didn’t need to sleep since it was hard to force myself to drift into sleep. All I could do was just stare up the entire night with just my thoughts to myself. I do hope they were able to find what happened to that key since I did not want to spend the rest of my life in this form.</p>
