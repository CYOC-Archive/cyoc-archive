<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Amelia was holding a small but intricate mirror lined with golden trim and different red, blue, and green gems around it's rim.  It was a magical looking item that currently displayed upon it her Menu interface to her current character… an interesting choice made by her previous owner that seemed fairly appropriate.  Tapping on it's surface was not unlike using a touchscreen phone, and she looked through her relatively low stats for a few minutes, thinking over her situation.</p>

<p>The message from Cross-Tellurian Fault (the company that created The Kingdom) had noted that each currently active account should have four or five currently active characters upon the pantheon of selectable choices.  Why there was only a single character tied to this account was a question that Andy hadn't thought about until just this moment.  Perhaps they were still populating the accounts and more would appear later?</p>

<p>Andy, as Amelia, looked over her form a bit more.  Running her hands over her body she found her skin to be silky smooth, her hair flowing down her back and ending just above her waistline.  She stepped closer to her hardwood dresser and looked over the items laying across it… a brush, some intricate loops for hair ties, a set of expensive ear rings, and a make-up case.</p>

<p>Amelia looked down at herself, thinking over her situation.  Outside of The Kingdom, Andy was just entering college and had used a lot of his graduation money to snatch up this suit almost on a whim.  Now he was a girl, and it felt a little strange… the different skin, the world being shorter, the emptiness between his legs, and the weight hanging off of his chest.</p>

<p>Looking around the room, Andy thought about the situation from an Out of Character standpoint for a moment, wishing he could have been instead turned into his usual character.  At least that way he'd have been following his already established experiences… and be <i>male</i>.  As it was, he directed his female form around the room, closing windows that looked out across the landscape of the kingdom he'd just inherited.</p>

<p>Outside, it was pristine.  Below and all around was an ancient city made of stone with horse-drawn carriages moving occasionally up and down the streets.  Merchants manned their stands, selling all manner of goods while guards patrolled the cityscape itself.  She saw a small band of thieves running and jumping across rooftops in route to some caper or perhaps just enjoying themselves.  It was busy, active, and so much more amazing from a real and first person perspective.</p>

<p>In the distance were green and grassy hills with farmland all across them.  Two dragons that seemed to be of fire and ice were flying around each other far off in the distance.  Their were mountains far off with the formation of storm clouds just above.  A ring of smoke hovered around the topmost peak and gave a looming and ominous view to all those who took in its sights.</p>

<p>She closed the final window, though, and looked around the room.  Everything was expensive and ornate and very beautiful, all white with gold trim and a few lines of pink here and there.  The family crest hung on a flag to one side of the doorway with a space for a second flag on the other side.  She thought that would be where the joining family's flag would be, and considered that Amelia must be too young to be wed and was likely a virgin.</p>

<p><i>Virgin,</i> Andy thought as he took Amelia's form over to the door to push it and make sure it was closed, slowly lowering the wooden lock across the metal hinges of the door.  <i>I'm a girl,</i> she considered, taking all of that thought into herself.  She pulled out her mirror from the air (being always able to access her In-Game Menu was very important) and looked at herself for a moment longer, those alien blue eyes were now her own.</p>

<p>She unequipped the dress and it landed on the floor next to her in a heap. Stepping over to the mirror, she looked at herself again.  Reaching for the bra to 'get a peak', she pulled it down a bit.  As it pulled forward, it became automatically unequipped and was suddenly just hanging there from her right hand.  She stared at it for a moment before her gaze turned to the mirror and this young and topless woman before him.</p>

<p>She up with her left hand and squeezed her left breast lightly at first, thinking it was so strange for this to feel like it was her's now.  She began rubbing it lightly, closing her eyes, and taking in the feeling of such an action.  It felt good, and she took a deep breath, trying to think of any number of naked females he'd seen doing this same action (and more) on various spots on the Internet.</p>

<p>The thought of such an image made him hard, in the real world… but the result of such an event here in The Kingdom made Amelia wetter between her legs.  This very strange biological occurrence made Andy open her eyes, and drop her hand from her breast.  She looked down at herself, and couldn't believe how real that had felt.</p>

<p>Cautiously, Andy reached down and began to pull her panties downward.  Sure enough, then were just a moment later in her hand, unequipped.  The full impact of PHUK being an Adult Only game had never had this kind of impact before… but before it had been 'just' a game, not this real.  She reached down with her right hand, running it over her legs, and up to her crotch, seeing her lips were a little open as she'd been aroused.</p>

<p>It wasn't that she'd never seen such a sight before, but that her sight was her own.  Tentatively, she touched herself there, putting one finger partly inside herself.  She could feel that finger entering her just a little, and that sensation was very real… almost too real.  But thena knock came to the door, startling her.  It seemed much louder than it should have been and Amelia flinched, standing there nude in <i>her</i> room, wondering who it was at the door.</p>

<p>"Milady," was the voice of the maid at the door.  "Prince Calypso of Reynard Province is here to see you," she said, timidly.  "I informed him you did not wish to be seen before the wedding, but he is insisting.  What should I tell him?" she asked, somewhat softly on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>"Marriage?" Amelia asked herself, thinking to fall into character… but how far?  She thought about this for a moment while the maid waited.  Did she really want to get married?  That was somewhat unexpected.  Perhaps she should call it quits and wait out the error, but this was so new and interesting.  This was such an unusual experience, and it had already been enjoyable… in a way.</p>

<p>"Well," she began…</p></p>
