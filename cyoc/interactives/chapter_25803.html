<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"But mom won't want a rabbit for a son... you can't hide this from her."<br>
<br>
"Well maybe I can."<br>
 </p>
<p>"What is that supposed to mean?" Dan asked.</p>
<p>"Mom may not want a rabbit for a son, but what about for her daughter?"  
She then waved the stick again and Dan felt very strange.</p>
<p>He could tell that he was getting larger once again, but things were 
different.  He wasn't developing the arms that he had before, these new 
arms were more thin, and his hands seemed very dainty.  The fur receded 
from his skin, but when it receded, it did so completely.  His arms and 
legs were perfectly hairless.  He thought that all of his hair would be 
gone; some cruel trick by his sister to turn him into a freak, but then he 
noticed a few strands of yellow fall before his eyes.</p>
<p><i>Blonde hair?</i> he thought to himself.  But I'm not blonde.  He 
reached up to feel the hair, but felt a stirring inside of him.  He dropped 
his arm back to the ground to steady himself.  He almost felt like puking.  
The pressure began at the center of his chest and moved down into his crotch.  
The surface of his chest burned.  He grabbed at it, trying to pull it to 
avoid that pressured feeling.</p>
<p>He was amazed when he noticed that he was able to pull his own chest forward.  
No, that wasn't quite right, because now it seemed as though his chest was 
pushing his hand out even further, all on it's own.  He stared down at 
himself to see that it wasn't his whole chest that was moving forward, instead 
it was the areas just around his nipples.  His nipples... they ... they 
weren't that big before.  And that colored area around them, Dan never knew 
what it was called, but he knew that instead of being the size of a nickel, they 
were more like silver dollars.  He had seen these before in a magazine.  
He gulped as he realized that he was growing huge female breasts.</p>
<p>He sat back on his knees and put his hands on his chest.  <i>These 
things are so soft.  </i>He then felt a jolt of electricity, not all that 
bad, but shocking nonetheless.  It traveled from his chest, held up by his 
tiny fingers, all the way down to his stomach.  He felt like his insides 
were rearranging themselves.  His waist began to pull inward, but all of 
that mass seemed to be pushed into his ass and hips.  He then felt his 
penis tingle.  With all of that extra weight traveling downward, it would 
be natural for his member to get a piece of the action.  Dan, however, knew 
that his dick wasn't likely to become larger in this instance, and his fears 
were confirmed when he looked down.</p>
<p>He penis was getting smaller.  It seemed to only be about one inch long 
now.  He reached for it, and noticed that, along with his small fingers, he 
now had long, well manicured finger nails.  By the time he looked back at 
his penis, it was only about as long as one of his nails.  His scrotal 
sacks then began to deflate.  He felt as though his balls were being pulled 
up into his abdomen.  The feeling didn't last long though as it was 
replaced by a stranger feeling of his empty sacks dividing.  He could see 
an opening forming between them.  His fingers slipped off of his nearly 
nonexistent dick and slid accidentally down into this new opening.  It felt 
weird.  He knew that he wasn't supposed to have a hole there, but touching 
it made the area tingle a bit.  His penis didn't seem to disappear 
completely.   It now sat at the top of the two folds of skin that used 
to be his ball sacks.  It didn't have a hole in it anymore either, but Dan 
then noticed that a smaller hole was just below it, and above the larger hole 
than contained his fingers.  This would be how he would go to the bathroom 
now, he figured</p>
<p>His sister laughed out loud.  "Well, well, well...  it seems as 
though you are certainly enjoying yourself," she mocked.</p>
<p>"What did you..." Dan stopped when he heard his unnaturally high pitched 
voice.  "What... what did you do to me?" he managed. </p>
<p>"It's not done yet my dear.  Just wait a little bit longer."</p>
<p>Dan began to stand, but as he moved, he noticed that his legs had changed. 
They too were more slender than they had been before.  He stared down and 
saw that his tiny hands now had a matching pair of tiny feet.  He did a 
double take at first, but then realized that his toes were painted dark red.  
He began to reach down toward them, but stopped when he saw that his fingernails 
had taken on a similar color.  He stood up and stared at his hands.  
He then glanced down at his feet again, but couldn't see them.  While 
standing, his breasts blocked his view.  Dan began to become less amazed, 
and more angry with his sister.</p>
<p>He looked up at her, but then realized that he was actually looking up at 
her.  She was not a short girl, standing probably around five foot, ten 
inches, but if Dan was looking up at his sister like this, he could only assume 
that she either grew, or he was now around five foot, three or four.</p>
<p>She smiled down at him.  "Problem with the height?  Let me help you 
with that."</p>
<p>Dan felt the back of his feet lift into the air as if they were being pushed 
upward.  He then found himself looking face to face with his sister.  
He looked down to see what had happened, but was reminded about the size of his 
breasts yet again.  He shifted one leg to try and view his feet, but 
stumbled and fell.  On the ground he found it much easier to see the reason 
for the fall.  He was now wearing very high heeled pumps.  He 
immediately reached down to pull them off.</p>
<p>"Ah ah ah..." his sister said in a disapproving manner.  "That's part of 
your outfit sweetie.  You cannot remove those unless I say so."</p>
<p>He found this to be true.  As much as he pulled, the shoes wouldn't 
budge.  It was like they were stuck to his feet with glue, but it was 
strange because he could move his feet freely within them.  He then noticed 
something emerging from the sides of the jet black, glossy shoes.  This new 
weird material seemed to be ascending toward his ankle, and then went up his 
leg.  It kept crawling up his lower extremities, moving over his thighs, 
until it came together at his crotch.  It went a bit higher and formed a 
band just above his belly button.  The material was dark, shiny, and soft. 
He had seen it on his mother before.  It was pantyhose.</p>
<p>The material didn't stop there though.  It seemed to be forming a 
thicker cloth over itself, but it didn't cover up his legs.  This thicker 
black material started to ascend up his belly and stopped just below his 
armpits.  It formed cup-shaped ovals around the bottoms of his breasts.  
He wasn't sure, but it looked like the breasts were lifted a little to somehow 
enhance the crease between them.</p>
<p>He felt a tingle on his head and reached up to feel soft protrusions jutting 
out from a plastic headband that was covered in silk.  The protrusions were 
long and also covered in silk.  His noticed that his wrists now had white 
collars upon them, but he had no sleeves.  As his hand fell down from his 
new headpiece through his hair, he stopped for a second at his neck.  He 
seemed to have some sort of collar in place there also.  Something felt 
like a bow.  He raised himself onto the new shoes and spent a second 
getting his balance. He took a step forward.  It was hard to walk, but not 
impossible.  He felt the weird size of his hips as they swayed back and 
forth with each step.  He reached back to feel his shapely rear end, and 
felt a poof of fur attached to the outfit bust above his ass.</p>
<p>He was about to speak, but tasted a strange substance on his lips.  It 
was kind of like the taste of a girl he once kissed.  Wait.. not the girl, 
but it must be the lipstick.  He reached up and tried to wipe it off of his 
face.  There was no way that she would force him to look like this.</p>
<p>"I told you Danni, you can't remove the outfit unless I say so.  That 
includes the makeup too," she said with a giggle.  "And, by the way, I 
don't like you shortening your name Danielle.  It's such a pretty name, for 
a pretty girl.  You don't want to chop it up like that. Don't let me hear 
you call yourself Dan again, understand?"</p>
<p>"You bitch," was all that he could say.  He was still surprised at his 
voice.  It was far higher than his sister's. </p>
<p>"That's not nice," she shot back at him in an angered tone.  "Change 
your tone young lady."  She waved the wand again.  "Do you 
understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes Kat.  I sorry that I acted unladylike. I love my new outfit. It 
makes me feel so sexy and feminine," Danielle said in what could almost be 
described as a bubbly voice.</p>
<p>"That's better," she replied as she lowered the wand.</p>
<p>Dan could feel his grip on the situation regain itself.  <i>What the 
hell just happened?</i></p>
<p>"Before you say anything else Danielle, I just want you to know that I can 
make you keep that personality for as long as I like.  If you would prefer 
to be a bimbo, then go ahead and yell at me," Kat said, interrupting his 
thought.</p>
<p>Dan felt weak... in body and in spirit.  There was nothing  that he 
could do.  He had to play along.</p>
<p>He began to speak again, but in a softer voice, "What is it that you plan to 
do with me?"</p>
<p>"Oh my.  It is going to be such fun having an older sister.  You 
can buy me beer, and get me into all of the coolest clubs," she said with glee.</p>
<p>Danielle's thin eyebrow raised.  "How am I supposed to go out and get 
beer dressed like this?"</p>
<p>"Oh that's not a problem.  Those are only your work clothes," she 
replied.</p>
<p>"Work clothes?! What the fuck?"</p>
<p>"Now Danielle, watch that temper of yours." She waved the wand again.</p>
<p>"Sorry Kat.  It's just that I had such a hard day at the club.  You 
wouldn't believe what a girl has to do to get a good tip these days," Dan said, 
slipping back into Danielle mode.</p>
<p>"Oh, I believe it," Kat replied.  "But tell me truthfully.  You 
must run into <i>some</i> nice guys out there."</p>
<p>Danielle blushed, "I guess that there is this one guy.  He has such a 
great body.  He works at the bar. I wouldn't mind.. you know," she said, 
smiling at Kat who just smiled back.</p>
<p>"Girl you are uncontrollable," she said, as she waved the wand once again.</p>
<p>Dan felt sick.</p>
<p>"See how easy it is?" Kat asked him.  "Now, are you going to cooperate? 
or is would you rather spend the next twenty-four hours fantasizing about a 
man."</p>
<p>Finding his strength of will, once again, Dan spoke.</p>
<p> </p></p>
