<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Transformatix, the rival company of Transdem Labs, has been working tirelessly on attempting to replicate the Chronivac program. They have backwards engineered the program and emitter so far, they have only been able to replicate a few of the functions and very little of the exquisite detail their competitor has achieved... But what they have created is a prototype that they could mass produce and monitor the usage of. They, however, need some field testing done and cannot as of yet reverse the effects on test subjects. Due to the lack of parents willing to allow tests to be run on their sons and especially their daughters, as well as potential litigation issues... well they donated one of the prototypes to GoodWill knowing that eventually someone will point it at someone else and pull the trigger. <br />
<br />
The device they managed to create looks very much like a toy gun. The durable frame has a number of switches representing some of the major aspects of masculinity including muscle, voice, body hair, and facial hair. These toggles are color coded blue along the barrel of the gun and have corresponding images that clearly depict a flexing bicep, a throat with an Adam&#39;s apple, a torso with hair, and a beard.<br />
<br />
The two non-gender specific enhancements include height and mass which have been left separate. Mass won&#39;t necessarily be fat but will instead increase appetite and the body&#39;s set mass point. Unless the person is actively trying to change their weight, they will hover around the new mass point within a few pounds. Height is one of the biggest trouble spots Transformatix has been having. They can&#39;t seem to figure out how Trans Dem reopens closed growth plates and makes completely grown adults grow more... As such, the height feature only impacts males under 21 and females under 18. These options are color coded green with a stick figure next to arrows pointing up and down, and a stick figure with arrows pointing side to side.<br />
<br />
Under the hidden battery chamber is a setting set to keep the world unaware, again, not having to deal with a court case is ideal. The last toggle option on the barrel is target awareness identified by a person with a question mark over their head, and the final setting is the intensity of the change which is located on the grip of the handle (labeled 1-10), both are orange.<br />
<br />
Having all modification settings set to off and pulling the trigger on someone will display their overall masculinity through a series of 10 LEDs at the top of the barrel. (On average: Preteen 0, female teen 1-2, male teen 2-4, woman 2-3, man 4-7. Of course there may be some exceptions depending on genetics.)<br />
<br />
Transformatix has not figured out how to create mass from nothing without flash freezing the surrounding area, as such, the device accelerates the natural growth cycle. This means that the changes are not instant and take an amount of time depending on the target.<br />
<br />
The changes that take the longest are height taking around a month and muscle/weight gain which take several weeks to complete depending on the intensity and availability of nutrition. <br />
<br />
The deepening of the voice takes a few days, throughout which, amusement may ensue, and the hair growth begins and is noticeable within a few hours. The hair options effect density, growth rate, and hair thickness all at once, the scientists have yet to discern how to effect one aspect at a time.<br />
<br />
Targeting a male preteen with all options (except maybe target awareness) on at full intensity will launch them fully through puberty within the month timeframe (though they will be able to do little more than eat and sleep). Targeting a female preteen will launch her through a male puberty, targeting her again will insert a Y chromosome and turn her hermaphroditic. Targeting a male multiple times will insert an additional Y chromosome which is suspected to cause an increase in final height.<br />
<br />
Sexual maturation is not directly effected by the device. Instead, enhancing the secondary sex traits forces a response from the primary sex organs causing them to mature or become enhanced depending on the situation. Biochemistry in an organism is not perfectly exclusive, such that, enhancing one trait significantly may have an impact on other traits. (The testosterone needed to trigger a 10 year old have a thick coat of body hair may also cause weight gain, facial hair, and a premature deepening of their voice.)<br />
<br />
Please note, this device does not change the perception of the targets age to those that already knew them. Those who know the target prior to being hyper-masculated will not consider them any older. New friends, however, may not be able to tell the age of the person. <br />
<br />

**************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Mark, a 12 year old boy, had recently found a wad of birthday money from months ago that he had never spent. He felt downright rich and the money was now burning a hole in his pocket. So, after telling his parents he was going to the local GoodWill he ran out of the house and went the two blocks to the local store.<br />
<br />
Going through the aisles he looked at the toys and games people had just given away trying to decide what he wanted. Mark noticed a neat looking toy gun which he picked up and tested in the air a couple times. It was neat in that it had a bunch of switches with weird indicators but didn&#39;t seem to do anything cool like light up or make any sounds. Mark was quickly growing disinterested until he saw a brown leather cowboy like hat. <br />
<br />
Feeling inspired, he grabbed the hat (which was adult sized and way too big) and went to the full sized mirror making his arnryist face, he pulled the gun pretending he was a rough and tough gunslinger having a duel back in the wild west. He was not too impressed with how fierce he looked and he really wasn&#39;t intimidating at all. In the reflection he noticed that when he pulled the trigger, one of the lights on the top of the barrel came on. &quot;Strange, it didn&#39;t do that before...&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
After several minutes of growing increasingly frustrated, curious, and confused he managed to put together that the toy lights up when you point it at people. &quot;Which is pretty cool that a toy gun could save its battery by not activating on accident.&quot; he reasoned. Trying it out he also noticed that it lights up different amounts for different people but didn&#39;t figure out why. The toy had a small tag he could read later, maybe it had instructions, he had already decided to buy it, it had one really cool feature, it probably had more.<br />
<br />
Approaching the register he grabbed gobs of candy and kept the hat figuring that one day it would fit him and until then, it was still pretty cool. Between the hat, toy gun, candy and tax, he only got change back from the 25 dollars he walked in with but he was happy as he walked out and opening a bag of skittles.<br />
<br />
None of the patrons, employees, nor Mark realized how lucky they were that all the blue and green switches happened to be down and how close everyone in the store was to having the weight their body naturally stays at increased by 5-10lbs each of the 3-5 times he tested the toy on them. The increase mass switch had been stuck in between settings and was jostled into the off position by a king size snickers bar. <br />
<br />
Mark walked home happily munching on candy, appreciating his birthday money... from... some relative or another.</p>
