<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No, it was too risky. Horny as he was Brandon needed to stay put. It was hard though, hard as his dick. He was hornier than he ever remembered being in his twenties, but if he kept giving in a fucking guys, well, he didn&#39;t want to know where that would lead. Even trying to picture himself having sex with a woman was hard, the image just kept changing into that of sexy young hunks. Hunks with big dicks, underwear bulges pressed up against his face, the feeling of a cock in his.. no!<br />
<br />
He lay back on his bed naked, hands pressed against his face. His hands slid down his chest, through the dusting of black chest hair to his nipples. He squeezed them and felt a jolt pass through him. They were so sensitive, so much more sensitive than he was used to. He almost wondered if he could get off just playing with them. He looked down at himself and squinted. And darker. In fact since his shower it looked like he had developed a slight tan.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his phone and turned on the forward camera. His face had changed more. His face was still distinctly masculine but there was something about it, maybe it was the fuller lips or the slightly upturned nose. And fuck, with that skin tone and the black hair, even with the blue eyes, he looked Latino.<br />
<br />
He quickly tapped out a text on his phone to Jannes. &quot;I want you here first thing in the morning. Something is very wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a moment but finally a message came back. &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll see you at 8am. Don&#39;t eat anything, I&#39;ll need to take blood for testing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon set his phone aside, he wanted to cry and scream, he never cried and screamed. He did yell.. but that wasn&#39;t the same thing. He also wanted to fuck. Eating certainly didn&#39;t mean sleeping pills. He rolled over and tugged open his nightstand, grabbing a few pills he used when he couldn&#39;t get to sleep and popped them in his mouth. He squirmed and writhed for a while on the bed, but eventually he fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The dreams came again, back in college. Hanging with his frat brothers. Big muscular jocks. He was still one of them, muscular, hairy, but he wasn&#39;t the one everyone looked to anymore. His dreams turned to sex, kissing one of his old frat bros as he undid the fly on the other man&#39;s jeans. Once his frat brother&#39;s cock was free he grabbed it in hand, lowering his mouth to it, taking it in. He felt another pair of hands pulling his pants down, spreading his cheeks. Something warm and slick entered his hole as he sucked off the cock in his mouth. He felt another cock splitting his ass open, thrusting in.<br />
<br />
Brandon woke with a start. Gasping for air. He felt like he had a death grip on his crotch. Something felt wrong down there but he puled his hand back. It was sticky with his own cum. He wiped at his eyes with his clean hand, noticing light coming in through the window. He turned to look at the clock. He had an hour before Jannes was supposed to get here.<br />
<br />
He got out of bed and made his way over to the bathroom by the bit of sunlight streaming in. He couldn&#39;t get his mind off of something just feeling wrong. He gipped the sink and blinked a few times to clear his vision. He was still the same young man he saw in the phone camera before he went to bed. He hadn&#39;t lost any muscle, though he did look more sculpted, his nipples sticking out of his dusting of chest hair looked a little bigger. He didn&#39;t dare touch them, knowing how sensitive they likely were. At least he still looked masculine, not some twink or little fem-boy.<br />
<br />
He walked over to the toilet and reached down to grab his dick. As he did so his eyes went wide. That&#39;s what was wrong. He was used to something big and meaty waving around in front of him. His dick was almost completely missing. He stared down at the thing sticking out between his legs. Two inches long and an inch wide, all that remained of his dick was a penis shaped nub. His balls were even pulled up tight behind it so he couldn&#39;t feel them. He felt at his sack and as he did he could feel his balls were just.. gone.<br />
<br />
It was like some sort of horror movie. He could feel a slit in the skin forming under his fingers. Then one of his fingers slipped inside. It was warm and moist, and the feeling of his hand rubbing his nub as his finger entered him made him gasp. He knew exactly what he was feeling form. He had stuck his cock and fingers in enough pussies in his life to know when he felt one. And his nub might be tiny for a penis, but it was huge for a clit. But that&#39;s exactly what it was now.<br />
<br />
He was shaking, his hand was wet with his own pussy juices, he wanted to curl up into a ball, and all part of his mind could think was how easy this would make riding cocks. He was a freak.<br />
<br />
Jannes would be here soon. He&#39;d have a way to fix it. Brandon slipped into the shower and cleaned himself off, carefully avoiding touching his new genitals as much as possible, only enough to clean himself. He knew if he touched it he&#39;d have to finger himself to orgasm. He didn&#39;t know why he knew, but he was just as horny as ever and he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be able to stop himself.<br />
<br />
He got out of the shower and dried himself off, quickly getting dressed. Just in time, too as there was a knock on his front door. He peeked to make sure it was Jannes before letting him in. The doctor looked him up and down in surprise. &quot;Brandon? Well. I must say the changes are certainly extensive if not particularly awful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon wanted to swing at the doctor, but just led him inside. &quot;There&#39;s more than this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jannes set a bag down on the kitchen counter, already getting out his equipment to do a blood draw. &quot;I&#39;ve seen ethnicity changes before, as well as orientation changes. Some experience a few, others have drastic changes. You&#39;re a good looking young man. I&#39;d say it was a success.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I?&quot; Brandon asked harshly as he pulled down his shorts, exposing his new pussy to Jannes. &quot;What the fuck is this then?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the doctor had the good sense to look very shocked. He knelt down to get a better look. Brandon started to back away. &quot;I need to look, as your doctor. Sit, spread your legs a bit. and lean back.&quot; He motioned at a tall stool by the counter.<br />
<br />
Brandon did as told, leaning back against the counter, trying not to look at Jannes taking a closer look between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fascinating. This is a first for me. I&#39;ve seen gender changes but this seems to be some sort of intersex mutation. The clit is swollen, much like you see in cases where women take testosterone for transitioning into men.&quot; He stood up and grabbed a needle. &quot;Female genitals but I bet the rest of you still acts male. Testosterone is probably still your dominant hormone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I going to keep turning into a woman?&quot; Brandon asked. He winced as the needle went into his arm, blood pouring into vial after vial.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe, maybe not. Most cases of gender change I&#39;ve seen in this serum, genitals change last. Like I said, it&#39;s completely possible it gave you an intersex gender. You&#39;re not really.. male or female. Parts of you are one or the other.&quot; Jannes bandaged the place he stuck Brandon and started packing up the vials. &quot;I need to get these to my lab. I&#39;ll rush them. I should have the results in a few hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked Brandon up and down. &quot;The serum might be about done, but I still would warn you to avoid sex for a few days. Just because it might be done with you doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s inactive.&quot;  Brandon saw the doctor out, then went over to his couch to lay down. Was this a price he could live with to be cancer free? Being some.. what was he?</p>
