<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Andrew began her long walk toward the
little village. She was out of the
mountains proper, but there were still a
number of foothills in between her and her
destination, and the more she walked the
more tired she was of the whole thing. Now
she began to understand why women wore
brassieres; the bouncing and bumping of
her unrestrained breasts was beginning to
take its toll on her back, as well as
being obnoxiously distracting. She'd have
to try and get a bra in the village - or
had they even been invented yet in this
world? Much less painful, but more
annoying, was the fact that her clutching
her little pouch of money in her teeth was
causing her to salivate uncontrollably;
but there was <i>no</i> reason the people
of this world wouldn't have some kind of
shoulder-bag she could carry her things
in.</p>
<p>And on top of it all, she was hungry.
She hadn't eaten since lunch yesterday;
depending on how long she'd been out, that
was a good seven-plus hours ago. But as
inexperienced as she was in her new body,
there was no way she'd be able to catch
anything out here, so she'd just have to
hold out until she got to the village.
Besides, she didn't really like the idea
of eating raw meat, anyway. So she walked
on. As she walked, Andrew examined her
wings, trying to get a better idea of how
they were structured. As it turned out,
they were built a lot like human arms,
with shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints in
about the same places relative to her
wings' greater length. However, the bone
structure ended a little past the wrist,
with no fingers or anything, which
explained why she couldn't manipulate them
very much. She'd have to do things like
writing and other fine motor skills with
her talons now, but fortunately those were
proving to be a lot more useful for such
purposes than human feet. The whole thing
was going to be incredibly awkward, but
like it or not, this was what she was
stuck with for now. Shrugging, she
continued on, down one hill and up the
next.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon by the time Andrew
arrived at the village. Or rather, the
sun was almost in the twelve o'clock
position; Andrew had no idea how long the
solar day here was compared to Earth's.
Feeling incredibly grateful to have that
long walk over with, she marched right on
into town.</p>
<p>Nobody came rushing up to put her to
death; that was a good sign. In fact, the
whole place was pretty cheerfully serene.
She did, however, overhear a little girl
talking excitedly to her mother.
"<i>Maman!</i>" the girl whispered.
"There's a bird over there that's a lady,
an' she gots no clothes on!" Andrew
suppressed a smirk as she heard the mother
shush her child, and she could see the
woman out of the corner of her eye, trying
not to stare herself. <i>Guess I'm really
as unusual as I look,</i> she thought.
Still, at least nobody was trying to
arrest her for indecent exposure.</p>
<p>She continued down what passed for the
main thoroughfare, a well-worn dirt path
that led to a well, around which were
built the largest of the buildings in the
village. There was what looked to be a
church and a few other buildings with
pictorial signs indicating what they sold.
Andrew looked around until she spotted one
with the sign of a mug, then went in. Sure
enough, it was a pub. She walked in and
hopped up onto one of the stools at the
counter, too tired and hungry to care that
the barman was getting an eyeful of her
breasts.</p>
<p>The barman, for his part, took it in
stride and tactfully looked her directly
in the face. "We don't see many of you
folks down from the mountains," he said,
amiably. "Not since almost as long as I
can remember. What are you here for, if
you don't mind my askin'?"</p>
<p>Andrew groaned. "I'm hungry," she
said, letting her money pouch drop on the
counter. "I want to eat before I talk."
She hadn't intended to come off so gruff,
but she really was starving, and didn't
feel like making small talk when her
stomach was screaming for food. The barman
nodded. "Yes, Miss," he said. "That's four
simoleans," he continued, motioning to
some dead animal roasting on a spit in the
fireplace, "and two for an ale."</p>
<p>Andrew opened up her little bag and
counted out two copper pieces. She
hesitated before adding a third, but after
all, there wasn't likely to be an age
limit for alcohol around here, and it was
probably safer than the water. She walked
over to the fireplace, tore a leg off the
roasting carcass, and carefully
hop-carried it back to the counter,
keeping the meat itself off the dusty
wooden floor. With a leg of...something
(it was mutton, but she didn't recognize
the taste) and a cool ale, she set about
filling her stomach; all her other
problems could wait.</p></p>
