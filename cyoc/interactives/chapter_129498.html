<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen looked at the cheer squad through 4 pairs of eyes.  As she glanced over each member, a memory surfaced of how the girl had looked prior to being changed, and then another memory surfaced of Jen and the girl having sex and the girl transforming into their current shapes just after Jen reached climax.<br />
<br />
<i>In this version of reality... I&#39;m the one who caused all of the changes.</i><br />
<i>No-one even knows about the curse any more.</i><br />
<i>Maybe I can find a way to use this to my advantage.</i><br />
<i>Best to act like this is normal.</i><br />
<i>If I freak out or start to tell anyone about the curse, they&#39;ll think I&#39;ve gone crazy.</i><br />
<br />
The Jen that Amanda was holding onto spoke while she simultaneously rearranged her other 3 bodies in a line next to her speaking body, &quot;Homecoming is this week.  You all know that.  But I was asked to have the cheer squad really drum up support and interest.  So we need to think of some ways to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen switched to speak with a different body, it felt natural for some reason, &quot;There&#39;s going to be a pep rally on Wednesday.  We&#39;re going to lead a few cheers there, but the varsity team will be the main attention.  They&#39;re going to do a short demo game against junior varsity, 20 minutes max.  The marching band is also going to be there, so we need to make sure to not compete with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
All 4 of Trish&#39;s heads groaned and one spoke, &quot;The band doesn&#39;t like us.  Especially that drum major Shelly.  She constantly interrupts our cheers.  Why do we have to be nice to them when they aren&#39;t nice to us?&quot;<br />
<br />
A murmur of agreement passed through the rest of the squad.  It wasn&#39;t the first time that this sentiment had been expressed, and there had long been a rivalry between Shelly and Jen.  But neither of them could openly act on the rivalry without risking their positions in their respective organizations.<br />
<br />
2 of Jen sighed and a 3rd spoke, &quot;I know they&#39;re mean.  I&#39;d love to show them up, but we can&#39;t.  Especially not this week.  We just have to be the bigger adults, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Awkward silence hung in the air for a few seconds, all of the girls not wanting to agree, but none of them willing to disagree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, that&#39;s that.  We&#39;ll just be better than them.  And as part of that... We need to come up with some things to do outside of the rally.  You know how everyone tries to skip the rally.  So let&#39;s hear some ideas!&quot;  Jen had several ideas already thought of, but always liked to ask for suggestions from the squad before making a choice.  It usually resulted in a better choice, and the squad respected her for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A cheer during morning announcements?&quot;<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do another video to be shown during homeroom, like last year&quot;<br />
&quot;We could sell desserts during lunch&quot;<br />
&quot;Contest to come up with a new cheer!  Then we do the winning cheer during the game&quot;<br />
&quot;What about a new school mascot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen smiled a set of 4 identical smiles.  &quot;All good ideas!  I&#39;ll talk to the administration and see which ones they&#39;re fine with.&quot;  Jen turned and looked at the clock with one head.  She frowned and continued speaking with another head, &quot;Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have enough time to practice any of our drills.  Sorry girls, not sure where the time went.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
With the meeting over, the squad split up into the separate cliques. Mary, Julie, and Gwen headed into the locker room together.  Mary and Julie shared a kiss which Gwen mimicked with her 2 heads.  They shared a good-natured laugh as they disappeared around the corner.<br />
<br />
Beth, Nathalie and Evelyn moved to the side of the gym - Beth and Natalie were both far too big to fit into the dressing room, and Evelyn preferred to hang from a wall or ceiling so there&#39;s less risk of someone stepping on her sensitive tentacles.  Evelyn raced up the wall, her many tentacles moving in seemingly random ways, but each precisely placed so she never risked falling.  Natalie yawned loudly and stretched, both raising her arms into the air, and stretching her 300&#39; long tail across the gym floor.  Beth did her morning stretching exercises, causing her lower body to dip and raise like a roller-coaster as her hundreds of legs cycled progressively through the stretches.<br />
<br />
Trish helped Tracy to track down a misplaced arm then headed into the locker room.  As Trish passed Amanda and the Jens, one of her heads said, just loud enough to make sure they heard, &quot;I don&#39;t know why Jen just doesn&#39;t fuck Shelly already.&quot; Another head continued, &quot;Yeah, she&#39;d be a lot more fun if she wasn&#39;t such a stuck up princess.&quot; &quot;She&#39;d probably enjoy being changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Trish&#39;s comments caught Jen completely off guard and left her momentarily speechless.  Before she was able to formulate a response, Amanda squeezed one of her lower arms tightly, distracting her and giving her a not-so-subtle hint to just ignore it.<br />
<br />
Once the locker room door closed behind the two girls, Amanda spoke, &quot;I can&#39;t believe the nerve!  She knows you won&#39;t change someone who doesn&#39;t agree to it.  We all agreed to it.&quot; Amanda motioned to her rear pair of legs and to the 3 large girls further down the gym.  &quot;We love it.  But we wanted it.  We wanted <i>you</i>.  Don&#39;t listen to what she said.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda reached forward and hugged the Jen she was touching as hard as she could.  &quot;I love you.  Don&#39;t do something that would make me lose you.  Now get down here and kiss me good morning, I need to get to class!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Wait, is Amanda my girlfriend instead of my best friend?</i><br />
<i>Whoa!  I always loved her but...</i><br />
<i>Well, she is pretty hot.  Her butt looks amazing as a humantaur.</i><br />
<i>And her legs are so dreamy...</i><br />
<i>And she&#39;s always been so good to me...</i><br />
<i>I want to kiss her so badly.</i><br />
<br />
Amanda looked up at Jen and puckered her lips.  Jen instinctively bent down at her upper waist, pushing her entire upper torso forward and down.  She took a step backwards to line her head up with Amanda&#39;s, and splayed out her lower arms to help keep her balance.  Once her lips met Amanda&#39;s, she held Amanda&#39;s head by the neck and really worked into the kiss.  She had never kissed a girl before, let alone a girlfriend... But she liked it.  And in this version of reality, Amanda was her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
While she drew out the kiss, Jen moved her 3 other bodies a little so she could get a better look at Amanda&#39;s body.  Her supple ass stood out wonderfully at the back of her humantaur body.  As she leaned into the kiss, she shifted all 4 of her long legs.  Her front legs peeked out from a miniskirt, and her back legs were completely unobstructed with no clothing.  Her upper breasts bounced ever so slightly in the space between Amanda&#39;s body and Jen&#39;s lower torso.  Her lower breasts hung large and full under her lower back, completely naked for the entire world to admire.  Amanda was a truly sexy girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Finally she broke off the kiss.  &quot;Wow, you haven&#39;t kissed me like that since the first night when we... well, you remember.&quot;  Amanda blushed slightly and reached back with her right arm and patted her lower back.  She winked, then stepped to her right with her back legs, and to the left with her left legs, letting her turn in place.  She stopped when she was facing another Jen and raised her arms up.  &quot;You better not have spent all your energy on that one kiss!  You know the deal - 4 Jens means 4 kisses!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen happily embraced her girlfriend for the first time (on that body) and second time (as a person) that day.  They repeated the kiss 2 more times with Jen&#39;s final 2 bodies, then Amanda skipped out of the gym, her 4 legs moving in rhythm.<br />
<br />
Now that Jen had a grasp on the changed reality, she decided to...</p>
