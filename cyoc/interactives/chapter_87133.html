<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the weekend wore the new group of friends grew closer. The group enjoyed sharing their life stories with Katie and she in turn was fascinated by the stories they told. They laughed, played and enjoyed themselves the way any normal ten year old would. Finally Sunday morning came and the group sadly began to sy their goodbyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for a wonderful weekend Katie,&quot; Claudia exclaimed as she gave her new friend a big hug. &quot;We definitely have to do this again soon.&quot; The girls smiled and nodded in agreement. &quot;I didn&#39;t think I would enjoy being a kid again,&quot; Samantha stated. &quot;But this was the most fun I&#39;ve had in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled. &quot;Glad you guys enjoyed yourselves. By the way I got you a present.&quot; Katie quickly ran to her closet and retrieved four cotton robes for the girls to out on. Smiling the girls tried on their robes. &quot;Um Katie there a little big,&quot; Claudia stated as she began to flap the arms of the robe that completely covered her hands. The rest of the girls looked at the overly large robes that pooled around their feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;I figured this way you could grow back up without ripping through the clothes you had on. This way the clothes you have on could be saved for the next time.&quot; The girls nodded in response. &quot;Well I guess you thought of everything,&quot; Mika said. &quot;Mary are you sure you don&#39;t want to grow back up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise shook her head no and smiled. &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m happy like this. Katie and I worked something out once this is done she&#39;s going to alter reality so that I&#39;m her adopted sister. I&#39;ve got a place to stay and I get a sister out of the deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia looked sadly at her friend. &quot;I&#39;m really going to miss you Mary,&quot; she said  sadly. &quot;Don&#39;t be, we&#39;ll see eachother soon. I&#39;ll be in touch so we can plan our next weekend out.&quot; The girls hugged eachother as the clock struck ten. The girls shivered as they began to grow back up.<br />
<br />
As they re-entered their teens their bodies began to stretch and there breasts began to grow. The robes they wore slowly began to rise and unpool from the floor. The teens now gathered around the mirror to much the progression take place. &quot;Glad to have you back girls,&quot; Tricia stated as she grabbed her swelling breasts. The others were in a similar state as they began to examine their 18 year old assets. <br />
<br />
Re entering their twenties the girls examined their maturing bodies. As the group reached 25 they marveled at their beauty. &quot;Wow we look incredible.&quot; Samantha said in awe. As much as they enjoyed their beauty they knew the progression was far from finished. Now 30 the women began to take on more mature forms.<br />
<br />
Fine lines around the eyes began to form on all the women. As they traveled further into their thirties their hair and skin began to lose the luster of youth. As they hit forty the changes continued. Tricia began to put more weight on her hips and thieghs as she began to return to the obese woman she used to be. Samantha, Claudia and Mika began to lose the trim muscle they had acquired in the youth. Finally grays began to overtake their natural hair color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though were 45 we still look pretty good,&quot; Claudia said as she examined her features more closely. Trica and Samantha turned to Claudia with sour looks on their face. &quot;Just remember we still have twenty years to go.&quot; They said in unison.<br />
<br />
As the women hit fifty they began to resemble their old selfs. Tricia began to put more weight on her arms and stomach as her massive d cup breasts began to droop. Mika and Claudia began to thin out considerable losing muscle tone and taking bird like appearances. Samantha&#39;s hair went almost completely gray with only a little bit of brown strewn.in in long locks. Finally the progression ceased when the women reached their original age of 65.<br />
<br />
The women had progressed from young girls to old women in a matter of moments. They now appeared just as they had when Katie had first met them at the beach. Although now elderly Katie and Mary Elise could see a renewed sense of life in their eyes. The women now turned from the mirror and looked down at the young girls they had left behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much for such a wonderful weekend,&quot; Claudia said as she hugged the girls. &quot;I guess we better be going...take care of yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Mika cried. Puzzled the group now turned to the elderly Asian woman before them. &quot;What is it Mika,&quot;Tricia asked.<br />
<br />
Mika looked at the aged appearance and turned to Katie. &quot;Katie, Mary I want to join you.&quot; &quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; Samantha exclaimed. &quot;What about you husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about that bastard,&quot; Mika snapped. &quot;That man is too busy sleeping with his whore at the office. I don&#39;t have any children because he&#39;s infertile and I have no desire to return to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you hate him that much why have you stayed with him?&quot; Samantha asked.  Mika turned to her friend with solemn eyes. &quot;For years I&#39;ve stayed with him because I was too old to try and find another man. I&#39;ve dealt with his nonsense because I didn&#39;t think I could try the dating scene again. After spending the weekend reliving my youth I&#39;ve come to the decision I want to give my life a new start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going to go,&quot;Tricia asked. &quot;If your just a kid whose going to take care of you.&quot; Mika pause and thought about this unable to think of anyone she lowered her head and sighed sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can stay with me,&quot; Claudia sighed. Mika turned and stared at her friend in shock. &quot;Really?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Mika, you and Mary Elise have always been my closest friends. I willing to be your guardian. Since my husband died it&#39;s been a little too quiet in the house, it&#39;d be nice to have some company again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two women hugged as Mika now looked at Katie. &quot;Can you do this for me Katie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded and made a wish for Mika to be ten again. &quot;Wish granted and this time you&#39;ll retain your memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika smiled as she went to the mirror to watch her regression. Already in her fifties she marveled as the gray hair began to disappear for her gray locks. &quot;This is so exciting,&quot;the fifty year old stated. She continued to watch her body as the muscle she had lost began to return. As she reentered her forties most of the gray began to disappear as her natural ebony color began to return. Her b cup breasts, which had sagged in her sixties began to perk up.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel,&quot; Samantha asked. The 35 year old turned to Samantha with a smile on her face. &quot;This is incredible,&quot; she stated in a mature tone. &quot;I feel re energized and just watching this take place is incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well don&#39;t get to attached to that body of yours,&quot; Tricia said. &quot;In a minute or two your going to be back in tiny town.&quot;<br />
<br />
25 year do Mika grasped her firm b cup breasts and marveled at her beauty. She was a beautiful woman in the prime of her life. For a moment she considered asking Katie to stop the regression but the moment passed as she reentered college. Sighing the 22 year old turned to her friends and smiled. &quot;Guess it&#39;s going to be awhile before I enjoy this view again. She said.<br />
<br />
Now 20 Mika tried to take in as much of her body as possible. She looked down at her smooth feet, firm legs and curvy theighs. As she left college and reentered high school she grasped her breasts. While still b cups they had lost their fullness and were becoming quite perky. As she became 16 she looked at her cute face and noticed her be begning to shift on her. The hem had descended from her knees to mid calf and the sleeves had crept over her wrists.<br />
<br />
Mika smiled down at Mary Elise and Katie who seemed to be growing taller from her perspective. 14 year old Mika smiled down at her friends and hugged them. As Mika became 13 she shrank more with the sleeves of completely covering her hands. The young girl hugged what remained of her breasts as they slowly melted away. Now 12 she looked down at the robe that was beginning topool around her feet. Wiggling her small toes she laughed as she became 11 and found herself even in height with Katie. Her perspective shifted as she became 10 and now found herself looking up at her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind me joining you two,&quot; she squeaked. Mary Elise and Katie laughed and hugged their new friend. &quot;The more the merrier,&quot; they replied in unison. <br />
<br />
Mika said her goodbyes and left her number with her new friends. Fortunately for them all Claudia lived nearby so they would be able to see eachother later in the day. For now though the group left promising to get together soon.</p>
