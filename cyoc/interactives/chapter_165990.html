<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It hadn&#39;t taken the pair long before their trek down endless street ended, the geometric lines leading to a curious building appearing to be reminiscent of a chapel. As the gothic city around them had already proven to be, the structure was in ruins, though untouched by the magical lines coursing through the stone streets.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is... what sort of blasphemy is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erviel found his gaze drawn to Ilvir, the Paladin&#39;s palms dimming as he appeared to try and process the sight. The fury in his voice was clear as day, though it was to be expected granted his upbringings. After all, what was such an ancient structure doing smack-dab in the middle of some dark citadel? Truly a crime against all that was right for the world.<br />
<br />
If Erviel was being honest though, he really couldn&#39;t give a damn. Without comment he began walking towards the steps leading to the entrance of the church where a magnificent pair of wooden double doors stood, delivering a hefty punch and sending them flying off their hinges upon reaching the top; leaving Ilvir to cough and choke in the cloud of wooden dust as he followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here I was thinking the Paladin was scared of a little sacrilege. Not that you have a choice.&quot; Erviel&#39;s maw curled into a smirk that did not cower under the glare he received in return, not that he ever found Ilvir to be anywhere near a threat. <br />
<br />
He focused his gaze on the dark foreboding interior of the chapel as the dust cleared away, strutting inside with apathy. Much like the crumbling citadel and exterior of the building itself, the interior was far from tidy. Ancient and undoubtedly abandoned, the air stunk of mold; wooden pews splintered and rotted with age whilst the pedestal at the far front of the chamber where a priest would&#39;ve stood had been overtaken by mold. Rubble lay strewn about as well, the chapel ceiling having long collapsed and allowing a glimpse to the endless black sky overhead. <br />
<br />
Claws tugging at his hood, Erviel&#39;s lavender eyes drifted about curiously. Regardless of where it was currently situated, any church would have contained at least some form of evidence to the deity or figure worshipped. Yet here, there was no crest, statue, or monument even close to such a description. The few stained windows that hadn&#39;t been reduced to shards of worn glass underfoot depicted nothing more than what he would describe as artistic vomit; &quot;artistic&quot; being a polite term in regards to what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
It wouldn&#39;t be too farfetched to conclude that the church had simply been constructed without a deity or even a faith in mind, he had to admit. Though it certainly raised questions how it pertained to the rest of the citadel.<br />
<br />
At this point, it was clearly just some big red herring to piss him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back we go.&quot; He announced dryly, turning back to the entrance to where the Paladin stood, indifferent to his expression. &quot;This has been a complete waste of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait…&quot; Ilvir outstretched his hand to halt him, Erviel&#39;s scales tensing at the light from his palm. &quot;Do… do you hear that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sound of you pissing me off? Yes, I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No, not that! Just… listen for a moment…&quot;<br />
<br />
Erviel crossed his arms and sighed impatiently, straining his hearing. While he assumed the Paladin had lost his mind from the sight of heresy, the sound of what he could attribute to the flapping of wings made his eyes widen in a momentary weakness. In a blur, all he knew was the sound of shattering of glass, a flurry of harsh growls from above accompanied by a shout from Ilvir, the ground being snatched from beneath him, and then something pressing its weight atop his chest as his back impacted the floor of the chapel.<br />
<br />
Black blood shot from his maw at the onslaught he&#39;d endured to stain the front of his cloak, the hood across his head yanked back by his unseen attacker who then forced his lavender eyes upwards, hardened claws pressing into his lower jaw. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, looks like we&#39;ve scored ourselves quite the prize, ain&#39;t that right, boys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting on his chest with its flaccid dick inches from his face was a muscular gargoyle made of stone; geometric lines with a crimson-violet colored glow etched across its stomach, chest, limbs, and the base of its cock. Its eyes held the same glow, whilst he could glimpse a similarly colored glow within its maw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think you mean, &#39;prizes,&#39; boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Away, you demonic facsimiles!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ilvir&#39;s protest was immediately followed by a harsh grunt and thud, Erviel assuming he too had been pinned by one of the stone gargoyle&#39;s cohorts. The others he could see from the corner of his vision bore similar lines across their differently built bodies, though it was obvious they were all male and incredibly pent up. It wouldn&#39;t take a genius to know they were vastly outnumbered either.<br />
<br />
The large bat-like wings at the gargoyle leader&#39;s back that had been extended folded inwards as it leaned forward in a mesmerizing show of flexibility, maw inches from his own. The action and smug grin plastered across the gargoyle&#39;s face was more than enough to annoy him, as he spat mockingly in return.<br />
<br />
...Which only succeeded in making its toothy grin widen even further, as it wiped the fluid away with a claw and teasingly lapped it away with its stoney tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Feisty, eh?&quot; Its large claws traced along the side of Erviel&#39;s slender form, stone cock growing erect at the squeaking resulting from the friction. &quot;Mmm, you&#39;re a real delicacy, y&#39;know that~?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah~?&quot; The gargoyle leader smirked once more, claws finally reaching the crotch of its latest catch; eyes widening and grin faltering momentarily at the cockless slit he felt, though it returned just as quickly. &quot;Ahh, I see now… clever one, aren&#39;tcha~?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erviel&#39;s maw parted with a quiet gasp as its fingers teasingly massaged his clit, the squeaking of his latex scales seeming to spur its incentive to do so onwards. The talons on the gargoyle leader&#39;s feet dug into the stone floor of the chapel as it gave a lustful sigh, its free hand eagerly clasping around it&#39;s hardening stone dick.<br />
<br />
Ilvir meanwhile was forced to endure the entirety of the length of the gargoyle who&#39;d pinned him, the loincloth he&#39;d fashioned from Erviel&#39;s torn cloak ripped away as one of the more eager gargoyles began to lap at his sack and growing erection, the stony tongue wrapping around the base of his member threatening to send him into a frenzy alongside the claws teasing at his asshole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, been a while since we&#39;ve got a human down these parts…&quot; The gargoyle who&#39;d been ramming its cock into his mouth seemed to grow even more relentless at the realization, claws of one hand running through his hair while another ran across his face. &quot;So soft &#39;n smooth too… fuck~!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eyes half-lidded, the Paladin&#39;s moans of muffled pleasure grew choked as the stone demon blew its load into his mouth with a growl, the familiar taste of semen registering itself in his mind. As he swallowed the gargoyle&#39;s cum, Ilvir couldn&#39;t help but find some semblance of shock at the revelation that these <em>weren&#39;t</em> Corrupted creatures. Or how it had actually managed to secrete such fluid when it was clearly made of stone.<br />
<br />
With its dick popping free from his mouth, Ilvir moaned as the gargoyle who&#39;d been fingering his hole with its claws and deepthroating his own cock increased its pace dramatically, the one atop him interrupting his cry as it leaned forward to lock him into a deep, passionate kiss; stony tongue unusually soft as it gently invaded his own.<br />
<br />
Erviel&#39;s maw and eyes clenched tight as the stone demon atop him vigorously grasped at its cock, while the wetness as a result of the black goop oozing from his clit made the entry of its clawes smooth and seamless upon plunging inside him. His own claws dug into the gargoyle leader&#39;s stony thighs, maw parting with a moan at the torrent of white fluid spurting from it&#39;s towering member. He too, had come to the same realization as Ilvir; the taste positively invigorating and refreshing in comparison to the taste of Corruption, which leaked from him as he reached climax.<br />
<br />
Ilvir panted as he and the gargoyle broke away from their kiss, the one at his asshole and cock retreating with its thirst satisfied. The many other winged demons who&#39;d surrounded them roared as they also reached climax, the ground of the chapel tainted with the white fluid wrought on by the sinful events. Those who has resorted to fucking each other lay collapsed on top of themselves, stone bodies pressed sensually against one another. He couldn&#39;t deny a sense of unusual kinship at the sight, even more so as the one atop him rose to its feet and brought him into its barreled arms.<br />
<br />
The leader of the animate stone demons rose from Erviel to offer him its hand, which was accepted without an utterance of smugness. What little semen hadn&#39;t been swallowed by the cloaked figure had been absorbed by his scales, though his cloak was drenched in a mixture of sexual fluids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, you&#39;re a special one, y&#39;know that~?&quot; The leader grinned at the lavender-eyed figure, claws cupping its balls in the fading throes of arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought I was gonna have to smash you fuckers to dust.&quot; Erviel flashed a smile in return, gaze rising to meet the gargoyle&#39;s towering form. &quot;Glad I don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, a blunt one too. You&#39;re a real catch, kiddo. Especially for a Corrupted.&quot; It smirked, crimson-violet eyes seeming to glow brighter; though its smile faltered for a moment. &quot;Sorry about the rough introduction. Saw you &#39;n just couldn&#39;t resist a good ol&#39; dynamic flourish.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Could care less.&quot; Erviel shrugged in apathy, though the grin remained across his maw. &quot;Since we&#39;ve got all that spicy business out of the way though, you big, manly gargoyles mind helping me out with something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The kiddo has a request, do they?&quot; The gargoyle leader smiled, claws massaging its lower jaw. &quot;State it and we&#39;ll see how things go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like you boys know I&#39;m a Corrupted, so to sum it up nice and easy; there&#39;s a cult here in this city I&#39;m looking for who are <em>also</em> Corrupted.&quot; He explained, adjusting his cloak. &quot;Bastards have a little something I&#39;m after, which is why I&#39;m looking for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little something, eh? &#39;N what&#39;s that?&quot; One of the stone demon&#39;s inquired, the other gargoyles all nodding and acknowledging the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I dunno… little something as in, a <em>dragon</em>?&quot; Erviel&#39;s eyes flashed, the group of stone demons falling silent as if to process his words. &quot;Seeing the big picture now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, so then that makes you…&quot; The leader trailed off in realization, eyes appearing to dim. &quot;So, lemme get this straight; you want us big, manly gargoyles to help <em>you</em>, a Corrupted, find this little cult of <em>other</em> Corrupted, so you can save this dragon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, that&#39;s kinda why I&#39;m asking, yeah…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have yourself a deal then, kiddo! Those cultist smucks sorta waltzed into this place one day and things haven&#39;t been the same since. Real pain in the tail.&quot; The gargoyle leader&#39;s eyes glimmered as he thrashed his tail for emphasis, tapping the claws of its fingers against the side of its face excitedly. &quot;Buuut,&quot; It interjected, holding up a clawed finger as his gaze bore into Erviel. &quot;We don&#39;t do stuff like this for free… we&#39;ll need some… <em>compensation</em>, if you catch my drift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The lavender-eyed figure&#39;s head tilted, eyes narrowing. &quot;Go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stone gargoyle leader smirked as his gaze drifted to his stone underlings, the geometric lines across his stone body seeming to glow brighter alongside their own as his maw parted with his stated desire upon returning to Erviel. Ilvir, having been held in the arms of one of the stone demons, couldn&#39;t deny a tinge of apprehension.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me &#39;n the boys here, in exchange for helping you fight this cult &#39;n save this dragon...&quot;</p>
