<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle hesitated, kneeling in front of the door with his lockpick. &quot;Are you sure, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian nodded quickly and looked around. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s the right place&quot; he hissed, &quot;now hurry up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door unlocked with a &#39;click&#39;. <br />
<br />
Kyle made the &#39;okay&#39; sign and slipped inside, Christian hot on his heels. The living room itself looked like just any other, nothing to distinguish it. The couches sat before a big plasma screen, and maybe that was a bit luxurious for a college student, but nothing screamed &#39;mad scientist&#39; or &#39;evil mastermind&#39; so far. <br />
<br />
When Kyle stepped on the carpet, holes opened in the walls and long twisty metallic things surrounded him. It was an horror scene straight out of a sci-fi flick. So there was the &#39;mad scientist&#39; part. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot;  Kyle cursed, &quot;he&#39;s got another security sy-&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian closed his eyes as light blinded him. Whirring filled the air as the things retracted into the wall, giving back the room its apparent harmlessness. <br />
<br />
Christian stared at the pile of clothes that Kyle had been wearing just a second ago in shock. At the shape he could make out through the fabric. The perky pink head poking out from under the shirt and atop the pants. His friend&#39;s long jon (nine inches, uncut and curving left) was all that had been left of him!    <br />
<br />
The glass doors to the lab opened and let through a plain-looking man with a tablet. &quot;I swear, I cannot get anything done with so many interruptions. At least, you&#39;re just thieves instead of cops this time. An easy solution to that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hugo - it had to be him, the rumors described him pretty well - lifted a camera, aiming for Christian. <br />
<br />
In a panic, Christian shouted the first thing on his mind. &quot;Wait! I&#39;m willing to make a deal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo stared, his eyes hidden behind the glare of his glasses. He barely reacted at all, only lowering the camera slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please. My little brother. I haven&#39;t heard from him in weeks!&quot; Christian dropped down to his knees. &quot;All I know is that he was at a party, and rumor have been floating about on guys getting transformed into their own dicks, and then the dean... Sebastien Allen. Do... do you have him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo seemed to think for a second. Nonchalantly, he grabbed Kyle by the balls and brought him (Kyle swinging all the while) to the nearest table. There, he activated some sort of device that strapped his shaft to the transparent surface. Hugo&#39;s expression did not change as he scrolled through some list on his tablet. Then, his fingers stopped moving and he turned the tablet towards&#39; Christian.<br />
<br />
[Model #6 - Sebastien Allen, eight inches, cut, cooperativeness levels: high]<br />
<br />
&quot;I do.&quot; Hugo said, leaning back against the table and caressing Kyle&#39;s dickhead. &quot;So, what deal are we talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian struggled to push the words out. &quot;Me. For him. A- an exchange!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, one cock for another does not make a big difference to me. How big are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten inches. I&#39;m his big brother, after all,&quot; Christian joked nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why not. I haven&#39;t had a trade before. Alright. I will turn your brother human again in exchange for dicking you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what about Kyle?&quot; he asked, pointing to the long dick lying on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not trading two penises for one,&quot; Hugo said, frowning. &quot;Choose either your friend or your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle stiffened on the table, and Christian could already imagine the pleading, the begging. He hadn&#39;t even wanted to do this! Christian had dragged him into this thing. He should help. <br />
<br />
... But Sebastien had been this madman&#39;s prisoner for weeks now! He had a responsibility.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My brother,&quot; Christian replied, clipped, closing his eyes not to see his friend&#39;s reaction. <br />
<br />
Hugo leaned over the table and whispered, just loud enough to hear, &quot;Guess that means you stay a cock then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle twitched and drizzled pre. Hugo&#39;s rubbing started to make a wet slapping noise. It... it made the room heat up, Christian felt. Despite his horror, his shame, he felt the warmth pooling in his groin at the spectacle. <br />
<br />
Hugo must have known, for he glanced up knowingly, then declared &quot;Well, I suppose we have a deal. Let me just get your brother from the machines.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wet &#39;schlop&#39;, Hugo went and retrieved an eight inch cock from some automated fleshlight. For just a second, Christian&#39;s mouth felt dry. &#39;Damn, I want one,&#39; he thought, before shaking his head in dismay. What was he thinking about at a time like this? &#39;Well, in just a moment, I bet the penis in that machine will be me.&#39;<br />
<br />
His pants felt tighter. Shit. Of all the times. <br />
<br />
Hugo snickered. &quot;So noble of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a flash and Christian started to fall. His skin brushed against his shirt on his way down, and the initial impact made him wince throughout his whole shaft. But the reality settling him distracted him from the pain. It was done. He&#39;d been reduced to a simple dick. A tool for pleasure. But at least Sebastien would be... <br />
<br />
His naked brother glanced around his surroundings, moving stiffly. He did not explode with joy or burst in tears of relief. He just looked... lost. Had Sebastien not even noticed what was happening? <br />
<br />
&quot;I was close...&quot; Sebastien mumbled, looking down at his hard cock.<br />
<br />
Without any care for who was there to witness it - namely Hugo, his big brother in penis form, and a whole bunch of dicked guys -, Sebastien began jerking off. The movements were frantic, verging on rough. Regardless, Sebastien only looked extremely focused. Eventually, strings of cum erupted out of Sebastien&#39;s dick, but his little brother&#39;s face did not change at all. <br />
<br />
Distressed, he lifted his softening cock and pumped the drizzling cum out harder. Then, when he seemed to have run out, he whirled around towards Hugo. &quot;I... I barely felt it. Why did it feel so dull, Hugo?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo shrugged, typing information about Kyle on his tablet. &quot;Hmm? Oh, you mean orgasms? That&#39;s because, before, you were only a dick. So all your mind had to feel was dick feelings. But as a human, you have all those superfluous bodyparts that divert your focus away from cumming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then change me back!&quot; Sebastien shouted. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a human. I love being a dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;No, no, no, no, no!&#39; Christian thought in a panic as Hugo blinked. &#39;You promised!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if your brother sacrificed himself to make you human again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sebastien nodded. &quot;Yeah! I want to be my own cock again. Christian will understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;No, you fucking bastard! I won&#39;t understand!&#39; Christian angrily twitched, the motion just enough to rub his dickhead on his boxers and the friction send a jolt of pleasure through him. &#39;Damn, huh, I mean, I won&#39;t understand!&#39;<br />
<br />
Hugo grinned. &quot;Well, if that&#39;s what you want...&quot;<br />
<br />
For the third time, the camera flashed and a dick flopped down on the floor. <br />
<br />
Christian couldn&#39;t believe it! He&#39;d offered himself in exchange for his little brother&#39;s freedom, and said brother had instead chosen to be turned back into a cock! Was this a nightmare?<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Hugo as he casually picked up both brothers from the floor and placed them near Kyle. &quot;Give it a few days, and you&#39;ll think just like Model #6. I suppose that means I should start calling you two by your new names, Model #36 and Model #37.&quot;</p>
