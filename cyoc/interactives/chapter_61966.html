<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Panting, drenched in sweat, Brendan bit his lip and grunted as the snake rode on top of him, helping both of <br />
them along by pressing her cloaca into his groin, driving his dick deeper, and receiving her own pleasure with <br />
each stroke as he filled her. She grew tight, her thick blue coils suddenly squeezed him with unimaginable <br />
strength as she tensed into her second orgasm in such a short span. Her head raised into the air above him, <br />
she let out a terrific hiss of release, and then pitched forward, gasping for breath. Feeling her clamp down <br />
on him with her sweet warm snakeflesh, Brendan finally relented his juices, unable to hold on, and then <br />
finally, together, snake and human collapsed in post orgasmic stupor.<br />
<br />
Gently, lazily, Vipress loosened her death grip on her slave and coiled further around his body, her slit <br />
slipping off his shrinking penis with a slight juicy slurp. For a cold blooded reptile such as Vipress, the <br />
heat from Brendan's still excited body was the most comforting feeling in the world. She wrapped herself <br />
around him completely, covering most of his flesh, and her scaly cheek rested against his.<br />
<br />
&quot;God.&quot; Brendan finally whispered. &quot;That was so wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessss.&quot; Vipress hissed, nuzzling her slave's soft skin with a light snakey giggle. &quot;But ssssoooo <br />
ssssatisssfying, yessss my handsome sssslave?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendan only smiled. They enjoyed each other's company for a time, basking in the warm and delicious afterglow <br />
of their strange serpent/human coitus. Though still buzzed, Brendan's thoughts turned to the consequences. He <br />
had fucked an animal, hadn't he? And what of Rick? How would he explain all this?<br />
<br />
Vipress sensed his change of emotions and she slid her tail up and down his leg reassuringly. &quot;Remember how <br />
good I felt. If you ssstay loyal to me, you can have that whenever you'd like.&quot; She paused and smiled next to <br />
him, catching his eye. &quot;And if ssssomebody daresss to hurt my sssslave.... well...&quot; She opened her mouth and <br />
flashed her distressingly deadly fangs before folding them back to the top of her mouth. &quot;They'll regret doing <br />
ssssooo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendan brightened slyly. It had been the most satisfying fuck of his life, for sure. And there was something <br />
more. He was loving this whole thing. So fucked up, but so cool. &quot;Yes, mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
She uncoiled from him slowly, the sensual body heat waning, and laid next to him as Brendan drifted off to <br />
sleep, spent.<br />
<br />
Vipress took a moment to reflect and smiled at the fresh memory of seducing and dominating the young human. <br />
She was huge, powerful, and totally in charge of her own destiny. She could do what she wanted and strike down <br />
those who opposed her. It was a new and exciting prospect - the sheer sense of godlike power was overwhelming <br />
for her. Like Brendan had said, no person would oppose her. Who would dare cross a large venemous reptile with <br />
human intelligence and a snake's cunning? She relished the feeling of power.<br />
<br />
After a while, her mind turned back to the potion. The source of her strength. It would still wear off, she <br />
considered. Perhaps a direct dose would prolong her state, as seemed apparent, but it was impermenant. She <br />
would still risk shrinking back down to her original size and intelligence. It was only a matter of time.<br />
<br />
She stared at Brendan. She felt a pain of regret for how she'd scared him into submission. Was she really <br />
evil? Really a cold blooded killer? Emotionless?<br />
<br />
The flutter in her snakey heart told her otherwise. She smiled, closed her eyes, and ran the length of her <br />
considerable body beside Brendan's, curling the remaining length of tail around his leg in a loving embrace. <br />
She fell asleep.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
The next time Vipress opened her eyes the room was ablaze in warm colors. Her night vision was something <br />
staggering to experience with her grown mind.<br />
<br />
Again, she smiled. It was as if it was still day to her. She stretched out, kissed Brendan with her tongue, <br />
and nuzzled his cheek. The boy still slept, so Vipress decided to explore.<br />
<br />
It was childishly easy to turn the door knob with her powerful tail, and with natural stealth she crept out <br />
into the hall as silent as death. She slithered across the carpet and paused at the door to the other room. <br />
There were voices, vibrations from movement, and Vipress listened to her senses.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said we could tonight!&quot; A female voice pleaded. &quot;Please, Richard, it's been so long!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm too tired, Tabs. Maybe tomorrow.&quot; Rick groaned. A switch flicked off and Vipress saw the light emanating <br />
from under the door vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it me?&quot; Tabitha asked, clearly upset. &quot;A-Am I not attractive to you anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... tommorrow!&quot; Rick growled. Then there was an awkward silence.<br />
<br />
Vipress waited. She was marvelously patient at this. She waited until she knew both humans were in a deep <br />
sleep, then with the same stealth as before she entered the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
She crept along the floor. Hissed quietly. Human, male, middle aged, she felt negativity wafting off of him. <br />
Apparently unable to get an erection, as she scented no sexuality from him at all. But the female was another <br />
story. She was human as well, not quite middle aged, and clearly projecting a decency unlike her mate's. The <br />
female's scent was longing... available. Needing to be pleased. Frustrated. She reeked of horny and her <br />
pheromones screamed fuck-me-fuck-me-hard.<br />
<br />
Vipress grinned. Another card to hold in her little game. She approached the bed like a reptilian ghost.</p>
