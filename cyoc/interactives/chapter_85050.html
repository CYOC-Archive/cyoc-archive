<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janace smiled and had an idea, instead of asking Charlie and Sally shi had led Anubis to Talia and Midnight. &quot;Um... Talia, Midnight, I know you two just moved in, and considering your mom and dad have children, we were wondering if...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more grandkat, I was wondering when you&#39;d ask.&quot; Midnight smiled and beamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandkat?&quot; Shi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, seeing as you have no male nor female terminology, anymore. I came up with a word for you. You&#39;re my grandkat.&quot; Shi smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it.&quot; Shi hugged Midnight. &quot;So you two don&#39;t mind if me and Anubis move in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, Janace.&quot; Talia smiled. &quot;I am actually curious what you found in Antarctica.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace smiled. &quot;Well, I was there, and I happened to have brought some artifacts, evidence that man had lived on the continent long before it froze over.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;However I have no idea what it is.&quot; Shi ran back to hir daughter&#39;s house and to hir room. Shi grabbed hir bag and came back. Shi opened it and had an idea. &quot;Talia, you&#39;re many century older than all of us. Perhaps you can guess the age of these.&quot; Shi handed a trinket and as soon as Janace did, Talia dropped it. &quot;What is it?&quot; Shi asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tha... Janace, That belonged to my....&quot; Shi sniffled and turned. &quot;I&#39;m going to be honest. There is a reason in Greek and Egyptian myth there are two versions of the Sphinx.&quot; Shi sat down, the others did to. &quot;My sister, my twin sister was the Greek Sphinx.&quot; Shi said rubbing her eyes. &quot;Shi left and found a home in... Atlantis.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Janace picked up the item and looked. &quot;Atlantis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;Well, my sister was a priestess there. And it so happens the continental shift, when it broke up, hirs moved south. My sister still visited, but visited less and less until one day no trace.&quot; Shi rubbed hir ear.<br />
<br />
Janace looked as Midnight rubbed Talia&#39;s shoulders. &quot;What did... shi look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like me in many ways, only hir wings were golden in color.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;Oh god, I thought that was just some statue.&quot; Shi pulled out a picture of something in cased in ice.<br />
<br />
Talia looked and that is what caused a burst in the dam. Talia went strait into tears. &quot;My sister. That&#39;s why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight looked at Janace. &quot;Are you saying that Atlantis, is Antarctica?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If Talia&#39;s story intersects with mine, that&#39;s precisely what it is. And it means I&#39;m making a trip back to Antarctica.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because. I have a friend who works with cryogenics.&quot; Janace answered hir granddaughter. &quot;Meaning there is a possibility that hir sister can live again.&quot; Janace smiled. &quot;So this time, instead of a team going to an outbreak, one will be going to Antarctica.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight looked. &quot;When?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once I can get a team together. And once I can get my friend on the horn.&quot; Janace smiled looking at Midnight and Talia.<br />
<br />
Talia looks. &quot;But why? Why are you doing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, if it&#39;s one thing my mother believed in,&quot; Sally walked in, &quot;is family.&quot; Sally looked. &quot;And believe it or not, be we all related by blood or not, from Francine and my father, to Raul and Maria, to Sammy and Gloria, and to you and Midnight, we are a family. It was Jess&#39;s dream to have a family and land to grow that family. Well, it so happens that shi is living that precise dream. According to the US government, every acre that people are living on in this town, is owned by Jess still. She is just allowing people to stay here.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s true. You are family Talia, and we got the boys together with their dad, and for this excellent gift you&#39;ve given all of us, trough your blood and making us all kats, it is your turn.&quot; Snowy walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;How...?&quot; Janace asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all followed when Sally called us and told us you had your bag from your rescue.&quot; Snowy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then, like Snowy said, you gave us all a gift, and it is time to return the favor.&quot; Raul walked up and patted her shoulder. &quot;And I shall lead the exposition to find your sister.&quot; He looked. &quot;A family is strongest together. And I wager the entire planet would be full of kats had we not worked as a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Talia walked out side, for the first time every resident, young and old, kat and human, of the City of Janace, was all standing outside and heard Janace&#39;s story and Talia&#39;s. And as they looked there were several volunteers. Jake walked up and smiled. &quot;I am the Vice President, and you know, after seeing my brother, my father, and his family, I realized, especially when I was in D.C, that Family is all you have. Everyone else, is strangers. With due respect to the President, and my good friend. I think I shall resign and move my family here.&quot; Shi took hir phone and called the president. &quot;Sir, forgive me for calling at this hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
________________<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright, Jake. What&#39;s going on my friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These outbreaks, sir, have woken me up. as of now I am no longer the vice president. I am going to spend the rest of my life with the people that matter most to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about damn time you said that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, I wanted you as vice president so you would wake up to what is really important. That is why I had a man as back up planned as the Vice President.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you planned this all along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, you enjoy your family. You have a very very long life ahead of you. You can run again and you certainly will have my vote should you run for office.&quot;<br />
<br />
_________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; After that he hung up and looked. &quot;Grant it, it won&#39;t be that easy. I will have one final trip to D.C. for a conference to announce my resignation but that&#39;s not the issue. The issue is helping you, young lady, get your sister. I can and will pull a few strings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia was in tears again, hugging everyone shi could. Never has anyone treated hir like this. Most looked at hir as a goddess, never as family.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Timothy was in the lab looking at various DNA stuff that could turn him into a kat. But he didn&#39;t see one that fit him. So he looked over. &quot;Um... Maurice, can you come here, son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a possibility, well, there is one animal I&#39;ve been fasinated with my full life. Even when you were kids...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Komodo Dragon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. But I don&#39;t see the thing for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, perhaps that&#39;s because the Komodo dragon has acidic blood and no one, and I mean no one has the balls to approach one to extract enough DNA.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just saying, son. Perhaps one should go get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, the only place I could do that is the zoo. Oh no, I am not going to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are these the base ingredients?&quot; He asks pointing at the concoction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they are but you need the animal DNA for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, the nearest zoo is in Colorado Springs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Timothy smiled grabbing the mixture and walked out. Maurice looked rubbing his head. &quot;Dad, put it...&quot; Before shi could get him, hir dad was gone.<br />
<br />
Maurice looked over at the crowd and walked over tapping Raul&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I need five people to go with me, we may have a situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Maurice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad&#39;s recklessness is going to get us into deep shit with the Colorado National Guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he&#39;s going to go find a Kamodo dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Attempt to make a Kat Serum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Well, wish the outbreaks would&#39;ve been this easy to detect.&quot; He laughed and grabbed Anubis and Ronnie, along with Janace. &quot;Okay, the five of us are going to go to Colorado Springs. Just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Ronnie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One word, Ronnie. Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? He didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Well, me and Maurice will go, have all on standby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice and Ronnie left to catch their dad. Sadly he made it to the zoo before the two did. Ronnie and Maurice walked in and looked around the zoo, dart guns poised at the ready. They had asked security to put the zoo on lock down and get people out as fast as they could, which worked. Unfortunately their dad had already injected himself with his own &quot;serum&quot; which was chaos from the start. Already shi had turned a dozen people, which Maurice and Ronnie had darted. They came in full sight of their dad and saw hir. Shi was standing proud but it wasn&#39;t Timothy who was proud, it was the lust.<br />
<br />
Maurice had took aim. &quot;Dad, calm down, I don&#39;t want to have to shoot you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come to be my fuck toys, girls?&quot; Shi said, the lust talking.<br />
<br />
Ronnie walked up, &quot;Dad, it&#39;s us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know bloody who you two are, and you look very sexy. Come, I can fuck one while the other fucks me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice looked. &quot;Sorry dad.&quot; Shi took aim and shot hir own father in the heart. Shi fell and Maurice and Ronnie took hir to the truck, appoligized to the families that had loved ones changed and explained everything.<br />
<br />
Once done the people were just grateful none got hurt and a full on outbreak was diverted. After that short visit they took Timothy home.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Once home, Timothy woke up, rubbing hir head. &quot;Ouch. I guess I see your point now, Maurice, and why you guys do what you do.&quot; Shi looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, it&#39;s okay. We all mess up.&quot; Maurice looked and patted hir dad on the shoulder. Once they stepped out Maurice led hir dad towards home.<br />
<br />
On the way they had encountered Janace. &quot;Jan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Look, I&#39;m sorry for approaching you the way I did the other day.&quot; Shi said and walked inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s with him?&quot; Janace asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say dad had a change in heart.&quot; Maurice told hir. &quot;Though I don&#39;t think shi&#39;ll be coming out for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope shi&#39;ll be okay.&quot; Janace said heading back to the pyramid.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, Ronnie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, bro, I think dad needs hir daughters more than ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. I think you and I are done with outbreaks until we get dad on hir feet again and having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two went back in and lied by their dad who was just watching the news and the trouble shi caused. &quot;I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know dad. We know.&quot; Maurice and Ronnie hugged their father who hugged them back and right there all three fell asleep.</p>
