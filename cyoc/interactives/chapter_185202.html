<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The longer her tongue was caressing against Madeline&#39;s, the stickier their chests became as honey leaked out, the more Jennifer found herself embracing this entanglement. All her life, she had been in the shadow of someone else, or subservient to others, or following along with what other people wanted. Even her own students tended to run roughshod over her sometimes, manipulating her, exposing her weaknesses as a teacher. Only Jennifer had ever truly respected her, treated her as a superior... and now, as she was lost in a mutation Jennifer had caused, desperately desiring to serve the doctor, to bring her joy and pleasure... how could she possibly refuse? How could she say no to her first ever chance to rule, especially when her first subject was so willing to submit?<br />
<br />
Her hands tightened around what was left of the student&#39;s clothing, tearing it away in an act of surrendur - not to Madline, but to the feeling burgeoning within herself. The part of herself that had been viewing this change as nothing more than some catastrophe, some nightmare to wake up from. As Madeline moved a hand between the bee-woman&#39;s legs, locating and teasing the most sensitive part of her anatomy, Jennifer was forced to reassess her situation. There were downsides, certainly, but perhaps not as many as she had feared. Maybe there were good things coming from this change. There was even the possibility that, added together, the good outweighed the negative. The excitement, the comfort she felt in Madeline&#39;s arms, was perhaps worth the pain she&#39;d endured.<br />
<br />
Slowly, gently, Madline began to lower them down to the floor, twisting as she went to ensure that Jennifer would stay on top. The blonde wished to submit to her queen in every aspect, to serve and service her obidiently and to the best of her ability. The act of resigning herself to the rule of another seemed to excite the blonde like nothing else could, as she leaned up and placed her mouth on one of Jennifer&#39;s four mammaries, suckling way with great eagerness to draw out the honey within. The doctor let out soft moans at the feeling of effectively being milked, two of her hands kneading at Madeline&#39;s own engarged breasts as a reciprocation. The other two were bound up in the girl&#39;s hair, brushing at it, then stopping as she felt a pair of nubs growing. The honey she was consuming seemed to be driving the mutations to accelerate, based on the way antenna were now sprouting from her head, growing faster than they had in Jennifer&#39;s case.<br />
<br />
Of course, she wasn&#39;t content to show care to only a single honey-filled bounty. One by one, Madeline moved between each breast in turn, gulping down more and more honey and driving the heat up within Jennifer with every moment. Her hands moved away from Madeline&#39;s head as new growths demanded attention, an extra pair of breasts swelling up beneath Madeline&#39;s already-considerable rack. Jennifer&#39;s mutated hands worked as fast as they could, soon causing honey to squirt out from the student, splashing against both of them. Wherever it fell upon Madeline&#39;s skin, the mutations there accelerated, fuzz and exoskeleton growing rapidly. The arms wrapped around Jennfier&#39;s back began to mutate, their structure shifting and thinning to match those of the doctor&#39;s - and then, without warning, the fingers of two new hands dove into an entrance already soaking with a mixture of honey and simple, sexual wetness.<br />
<br />
The doctor cried in ecstacy, leaning back and kneeling as Madeline crawled to add her tongue to that which was probing within her teacher. Through tears of pained joy, Jennfier glanced down to see that Madeline&#39;s legs were already near-identical to her own, her back splitting for a set of wings to emerge. Genetically speaking, there was little difference between them now - they were both the same hybrid species, halfway between bee and human. She became aware in that moment that Madeline must have been in excructiating pain as her body was reformed, yet she had never once let up in pleasuring the doctor. Her dedication in the face of agony demanded a reward, one that was provided as Jennfier pulled Madeline around so that she could lay atop the newly-transformed blonde, Madeline&#39;s mouth still working at her slit as Jennifer was now able to plant kisses around the moistened pussy of her own servant.<br />
<br />
Compared to Madeline, she was a bit... clumsy. This wasn&#39;t something she had ever done before, and it took a few moments of licking away, mandibles clicking against the inside of Madeline&#39;s thighs, before she settled into a pleasant rythym. Both women began to buck their hips as all rational thoguht was lost beneath the animalistic desire, a queen and her servant totally immersed in the fulfillment of each other&#39;s carnal needs. Honey and other fluids splattered all over each other and the floor, until at last, almost at the same time, they were rocked by explosions within themselves. Pure bliss sending muscles into an extended spasm and producing screams of joy, only slowly tapering off as Jennfier crawled away to sit against a wall, Madeline not far behind. She had entirely mutated by now, a bee-woman just like Jennifer, and the doctor couldn&#39;t help but think she was the most beautiful creature she&#39;d ever laid eyes on.<br />
<br />
Their arms wrapped around each other haphzardly, both of them exhausted from their little bout of exercise and the long night. In the morning, they would have a huge mess to clean up and a host of problems to sort out... but for this moment, as Jennifer cradled her obedient servant, she felt content for the first time in a long, long while. This accident had completely upended her life, and in truth, she was now thankful for it... and at the back of her mind, she was already pondering who else might be willing to submit to her as their queen.</p>
