<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This is the most butt-clenching week I have ever felt my entire life. The previous elections were not this tense. The town still believed in the Campbell’s but some are beginning to be swayed by Alex Hill’s sweet words. The two candidates gave promising projects and rebutted each other’s platforms. They seem to be at a standstill. Everything will become clear during the pre-election trials and the elections itself.<br />
<br />
Tuesday is the calm before the storm. It would be true if Mr. Harrison did not suddenly announce that there would be a surprise two 10-item test in Biology tomorrow. Science is not my forte. Never has been. I could study, but as I tried to open my book that very evening, the mirror glinted at me. It called me to use its powers and so, I did. I uttered Mr. Harrison’s full name and stepped inside his eyes. In my mind, I always imagined him to be a family man. A father to two children with a loving wife. Not this trailer park lifestyle near the mountains. He lived alone and his only neighbors are woodland critters. So, this is what a loser feels like? Eh. I don’t see much of a difference. Wait, am I a loser? I did not stay long to find out. I looked for Mr. Harrison’s laptop and looked for the answer key to the exam. I snapped a picture with his phone, sent it to my and Ron’s email, and deleted all evidence that would point to my crime.<br />
<br />
We aced the test the following day without Mr. Harrison noticing anything wrong. Ron thanked me for sharing the answer and even treated me to some milkshakes uptown. <br />
<br />
Thursday is a holiday when the settlers first came into these very lands. They cut down trees as many natives it took to get here. This day, however, is not a day for rest. Most of the town congregated at the park reserve entrance where two baskets filled with bird seeds stood atop a podium. One basket is named Campbell and the other Hill. Inside those baskets are bird feed made by two of the candidates. If more birds congregate in one basket than the other, that means nature has chosen that candidate to win. If a bird not native to the state appeared and ate on one basket, it is an immediate win. It has no legal standing, however. But it helps the spiritualist senior citizens of the town to choose the candidate. Ron told me that Alex Hill bought bird seeds from abroad, and the packaging on the sack says they are extra premium. I know grandpa still uses the feed mix he always makes. His mix is so good that he always won and gained the support of the older population. This time, however, I could see the fear in his eyes. He is doubting himself and Ron’s live stream cemented that fact. Several small bird-of-prey swooped in and landed on Hill’s basket. Some dipped in grandpa’s but they hopped towards Hill’s. <br />
<br />
With the power bestowed by the mirror, I won’t let this happen. I uttered the name of the school pet, Henrietta Powell - a talking parrot that lives in the open-air sanctuary behind the school grounds. I am afraid that this would not work because I am using it on an animal. I was relieved when I saw her green feathered avian head in the mirror. Then fear set in once more - as I am afraid that I won’t be able to return to my body. Was it being reckless? Or was it actual love for my grandfather that pushed me inside? I do not know but it already happened.<br />
<br />
I found myself flying above tree-tops and cawing at a certain nothingness. My wings flapped and it carried me further in the air. The world below me looked large and globular like I am in a snowglobe world. I left the sanctuary for the skies outside. My bird brain wanted food because I am hungry. The invading human mind said there is food to the west and it demanded that I only eat on the left basket. I sped eastward in a place where a sea of people are watching my brethren eat scrumptious seeds laid for them. My vision set in for the basket on the left but smell lulled me to the right. It smelled like honeyed walnut and roasted almonds. My bird tongue is salivating and I would have fallen for it if my human mind reminded me of my goal.<br />
<br />
The onlookers pointed at me with a series of gasps. College students recognized me as Henrietta - the school pet. I could see Ms. Irene, a sanctuary caretaker, scratching her head as to why I am here. Henriette never left the sanctuary even though she is free to leave anytime. This would be the first time she left, and it would certainly be the most controversial since I began eating grandpa’s bird feed. The lack of smell in grandpa’s feed meant nothing to the taste it had. It tastes like nature’s sweet embrace, like dewdrops that melt in your mouth. As I continued to munch on those seeds, some of the birds joined me on the feast. Even though I am a bird, I did not understand what the other birds were saying but I had a gist of what they were. One bird called the others and said that the other basket has a more delicious feed. One bird agreed. Soon, grandpa’s basket is now covered with birds fighting to get a taste of his bird mix. My appearance alone should cement grandpa’s victory in this competition. It was a spit to Alex Hill’s face when grandpa’s basket finished faster than his. <br />
<br />
In the commotion of the birds flying away to their merry lives, I uttered my real name using Henrietta’s parrot voice and returned to my body. I have messages from Ron and my other friends congratulating me on my grandfather’s win in the competition. They said nature has bestowed its grace on the Campbell’s once more. Little do they know that it is I who have made that choice.<br />
<br />
Friday. The Election. The time everyone is waiting for. Polling booths are filled to the brim with people. Ron and I went together but not without meeting Boedy first. He said that we may have won yesterday but we’ll see who gets the last laugh. He laughed. The dunce did not realize that by laughing first, he was giving the last laugh to me. He sped away on his convertible without a lick of his stupidity.<br />
<br />
Mist Hollow is a small town so it did not take long for the votes to be counted. The controversial competition yesterday swayed most of the town in my grandfather’s favor. He won, much to the Hill’s annoyance. I saw Boedy on my way back. Ron and I laughed at him as he closed the hood of his convertible. We stopped at a convenience store on our way back and spent our savings on snacks, sodas, and some liquor. Grandma will be celebrating with grandpa at the Town Hall, which leaves me and Ron alone in the house with the mirror. Grandma gave me the heads up that I am allowed to host a party with my friends, as long as I keep the house clean just as she left it. I could, but I probably won’t. Ron and I are going to use the mirror, although I think he already has a person he wants to possess today. Probably his brother’s soccer rival to help him in tomorrow&#39;s match.</p>

As for me, what should I do next?</h3>
