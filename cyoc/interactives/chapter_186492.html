<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bajoo watched as his still warm semen began to seep into the bedsheet and covers, the animorph virus it carried working its way into Sam&#39;s body as the damp patches came into contact with the teen boy&#39;s skin.  For all intents and purposes Sam was now wrapped-up in a cocoon of infectious grizzly bear cum.  He let out a moan in his sleep as the rich animal scent from Bajoo started to overwhelm his nostrils, the sheet over his head trapping the bear&#39;s thick musk.  In one breath Sam would take in Bajoo&#39;s beastly scent and in the next his own boyish B.O. until the boy&#39;s muddled brain was unable to untangle the difference between the two -bear and human became one in the same.  <br />
<br />
Before Bajoo&#39;s arrival Sam had started his sleep dreaming that he was a futuristic soldier fighting in the popular first-person shooter he&#39;d been playing all evening.  However, that began to slowly change as his body marinated in his donor&#39;s virile bear cum.  The dream began in a ruined city in the throes of winter, which was the usual starting level for the game.  But little-by-little trees sprouted through the cracked pavement and the landscape shifted to a deep forest filled with trees.  It was summer in the forest and Sam grew hot in the dream lugging around his character&#39;s woven metasteel armor.  He decided to take it all off to let his body cool down.  However, as Sam removed his protective gauntlets he saw to his surprise that each of his arms was covered in thick brown fur.  He knew this wasn&#39;t in the game but Sam was curious and he continued to remove the armor, piece by piece.  As the last piece of protective armor dropped and dissolved on the forest floor, Sam looked over the pelt covering his body and realized that he was where he belonged, not in the city but somewhere else.  Somewhere where beasts like him were meant to live. <br />
<br />
And, as Sam&#39;s dream changed, so too did the sleeping teenager&#39;s body in the real world.  Sam had recently entered puberty and had just started to grow a few wispy body hairs under his arms and around his dick.  Chest hair was in the far future.  However, this was all about to change as Sam experienced a severe itch in the space between his nipples with light brown hairs suddenly pushing their way up through his skin.  Sam rolled onto his back and reaching up he scratched at the burgeoning patch of fur with fingernails that were already usually sharp.  Bajoo could see the boy stirring underneath the cum-soaked sheets and feared for a moment that Sam was awake but after relieving the itch from his new chest tuft the teen rolled back over and began to snore again.  <br />
<br />
Curious to see the transforming boy, Bajoo leaned over and gingerly peeled back the sheet over Sam&#39;s head.  He could immediately see that Sam&#39;s cheeks were slightly swollen and his nose had tipped up into the start of his new muzzle.  The grizzly also noticed other parts of Sam&#39;s head had started to change while it had been marinating in Bajoo&#39;s cum and musk; the teen&#39;s sideburns had grown out into full-on mutton chops, even spreading partway over his cheeks to form furry brown cheek ruffs.  Nor were his ears untouched.  They&#39;d grown a short coating of fur and were larger and rounder than any human&#39;s had a right to be.<br />
<br />
Wanting to see more and with Sam still fast asleep, Bajoo pulled back the covers all the way to reveal the rest of the teen&#39;s body.  It turned out the boy was sleeping naked!  Bajoo grinned.  Surely this was a sign that the youth was a wild beast at heart!  Bajoo could see that Sam was now sporting not only a light brown tuft of fur on his chest, but that he&#39;d grown swathes of dark brown grizzly bear fur down his forearms and across the tops of his hands.  His fingers were still furless (for now) but his fingernails had grown by at least an inch and resembled the start of what would become a mean set of bearclaws.    Sam&#39;s feet were also transitioning into something clearly inhuman.  Like his sister, Cindy, the boy was sporting inch-long toeclaws but beyond that his toes were swollen into something far more paw-like.  His feet as a whole were longer and wider than any boy his age and a healthy thatch of dark brown fur was busy spreading on top of each one.  <br />
Sam&#39;s legs were still furless for the time being, although his leg hair had thickened to something more appropriate on a forty year-old lumberjack than a young teenager.  Thinking back many years ago to his time in the forest, Bajoo remembered how young bears have disproportionately large paws until they grow into them as adults.  If that was any measure, then this cub would mature into a mighty fine grizzly bear as he got older.<br />
<br />
Finally, Bajoo&#39;s gaze strayed to the package between Sam&#39;s legs.  Bajoo had never seen a circumcised human penis before and he examined it with interest.  Sam&#39;s was small and pink and the head was strangely round.   He glanced over at his own package and grunted, comparing the thick musky sheath that protected his bearhood with the human&#39;s pitifully exposed member.  But as Bajoo was examining Sam&#39;s dick he noticed something odd happening.  The skin around the base of the teen&#39;s penis was starting to move, knitting itself together to form the early beginnings of a sheath.  But that was not all.  Sam was sporting only a few curly brown pubic hairs above his dick as was typical for a teen at the start of puberty.  However, soft little hairs, the very same light brown color as Sam&#39;s chest tuft, were now beginning to sprout from above his shaft.  They spread rapidly and overwhelmed the sparse curly human pubic hairs he&#39;d painstakingly grown, forming a healthy patch of pubic fur that ran from below his belly button down across his new semi-sheath.  Bajoo took note that it must have been a pleasurable feeling to grow fur down there.  Sam had reached down to scratch his new pubic fur with his clawed hand and was now smiling broadly in his sleep.  <br />
<br />
Bajoo was glad to see the boy was happy.  No doubt he&#39;d be a bit confused upon waking up tomorrow but that was why Bajoo was there.  He would guide this young bearman through the rest of his changes just as he would guide his sister and mother.  They would then be a happy animorph family together.  Bajoo drew in the scents from the room with his big snout once more.  Not only was the room still thick with the the odor of Bajoo&#39;s own musk and seed, but there was a new odor that was tickling the edge of Bajoo&#39;s olfactory nerves.  It was the scent of a grizzly cub on the threshold of adulthood and it was coming from the sleeping teen who was now producing his own unique bear musk.  <br />
<br />
Realizing that his work was done for the time being, Bajoo pulled the sheet and covers back over Sam&#39;s body and quietly made his way back out of the teen&#39;s bedroom.  Satisfied with what he&#39;d accomplished Bajoo then...</p>
