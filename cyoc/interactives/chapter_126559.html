<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike ignored her. &quot;I wish that we were both normal again,&quot; he said. Fifty dollars disappeared this time.<br />
<br />
The world seemed to go out of focus for a moment. Everything shifted strangely as if reality had been flipped 360 degrees around in every direction at once. Then, things came back into focus.<br />
<br />
Mike was sitting down in his little sister&#39;s room, surrounded by her pink walls. He tried to remember why he had crawled in here.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing in my room?&quot; Jennifer squeaked up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I guess I wanted to see you,&quot; he said. Then, he remembered. &quot;Oh, I wanted to use the Wishing Money.&quot; He opened his hand and showed her the remaining 46 crumpled dollars.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jennifer said. &quot;That&#39;s my money.&quot; She stepped up between his legs and grabbed all of the money out of his hand. &quot;Now, get out of my room. Mom and Dad said you are too big to be upstairs, and I don&#39;t want you breaking my stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I thought I might be able to wish myself smaller,&quot; he said. &quot;I always wondered what it might be like to be the size of a normal human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just, go back to your shed,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ll talk about making wishes together later if you stay out of my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out!&quot; she said and pointed at her door.<br />
<br />
He sighed. &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll crawl back outside.&quot; He crawled out of her door, and sort of dragged himself down the hallway and down the stairs. It was a tight fit, but he was used to moving around human buildings now. He rarely even knocked anything over. Still, he worried that he might not be able to fit in hallways anymore once he became an adult. Carefully, he unlocked the back door and slid it open. Then, he was back outside again. He stood up and stretched his giant body. When he looked back into Jennifer&#39;s window behind him, their eyes met, and she shut her curtains. &quot;Great,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess I won&#39;t be getting smaller anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked back to his shed and opened the big door. He had to stoop to get in, but at least he could stand up inside the shed, even if his head was getting closer and closer to the ceiling each year as he grew older. He sat on his giant chair and thought about how unfair life was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does she get the Wishing Money?&quot; he asked. &quot;I&#39;m the one who needs wishes. She&#39;s just an ordinary little girl. I&#39;m a freaking giant.&quot; He thought about how many times he had silently wished to be just like any other kid. If only he could be like them, he might even make a friend. It seemed as though his body was his worst enemy. It made him an outsider everywhere, and it just kept getting worse as he grew older and bigger. He knew that people feared him even if he would never try to hurt anyone. Just being big made him dangerous. He would do just about anything to be smaller, even just a little bit smaller.<br />
<br />
On top of it all, he hated how being a giant made things difficult for his family. He had to walk everywhere unless they rented a truck to carry him around. All of his clothes had to be tailored just for him, and his food cost a fortune. To pay for it all, they had made deals with businesses, which meant that all of his clothes were covered in oversized advertisements. He had gotten used to being a walking billboard, but it was hard to get used to always feeling like a burden.<br />
<br />
Of course, his family never complained about him. His parents had found him in the woods one day, abandoned on a large tarp. There was no sign of other giants around, and they never figured out where he had come from. They decided to take him in as their adopted son, and they loved him deeply. As he grew, an endless parade of government agents, social workers, and scientists examined him, but none of them could explain how or why he was so big. He became a minor celebrity, The Giant Baby, but even that attention faded away in time. Still, his parents were always supportive of him and tried their best to give him as normal a life as was possible. They treated him as a normal child, and, even when they had their own normal daughter, they never neglected him. Although Jennifer never really liked him, his sister tried to treat him as a normal big brother.<br />
<br />
But, life would never be normal at his size, not when even the tallest humans were less than half his size. In a fundamental way, he was utterly alone and always would be.<br />
<br />
He lay down on his giant bed and started to cry quietly, and he stayed there until his mom rang the dinner bell.</p>
