<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex was a 17 yr old who gave up on life, he wasn’t really popular in high school, most teens tend to push him to the side. He tried to communicate with others the he could, but most of them talk about sports or games he never even heard of, or that one James who hooked up with Jessica, and broke up with Sally. <br />
<br />
He didn’t really understood anything that came from their mouth, although some people talk to him not because of conversation, but to help them with their work when the lesson was “supposedly” tough and they need someone to give them the answers.<br />
<br />
Life sucked for Alex everyone looked the other way. He never really had any friends to begin with, he was a quiet kid that had good grades and doesn’t get into dating with anyone. Or so that was he make himself in public, but when he’s at home, he always rushes to his room to get to his computer turning it on and search the internet for his deepest crush....were anthropomorphic rabbit girls.<br />
<br />
His fascination with these furry beings ever since he ever laid eyes upon them grew. It was at a point where he had lucid dreams about them, him naked in a large bed with 2 rabbit girls surrounding him rubbing their soft naked fur bodies against his, stroking his chest before moving down to his erect member before he wakes up looking around before becoming depressed.<br />
<br />
One day however, he was searching the web when he found a website that read “Magic, Gimmicks, and Beyond” searching through the site he found that it was a shop, it seemed to be selling knit knacks of all sorts even a shrunken head though find those things creepy. <br />
<br />
Searching some more he spots a pendant that seemed to be on sale reading the description it was a wishing pendant said to have the power to actually grant wishes. It was a shot in the dark, but he just had to have it, if it truly does grant wishes then maybe then he can experience his fantasy, luckily it states the store is close by to where his house is.<br />
<br />
In no time he rode his bike to the place, once he got there. He stopped, looking at the store nothing seems out of place, but he could feel that something was wrong. Dropping his bike he entered the establishment, It was filled to the brim with all kinds of things that were listed on the site. <br />
<br />
He was caught off guard and jumped back he he heard a women’s voice deeper into the store saying “How May I help you?”. Looking at the source he sees a women in her 40’s wearing a purple dress behind the counter. <br />
<br />
“Hi, um I just wanted to check out your items in your shop, it looks really pretty.”<br />
<br />
Looking at the women her eyes pierced through Alex.<br />
<br />
“Oh no... I can see it in your heart, you aren’t just looking you want to buy something here, and I think I know what.” She then opens a drawer and grabs something before slowly opening her hands to show a golden pendant.<br />
<br />
“Is this what your looking for?”<br />
<br />
“H-how did you know?”<br />
<br />
“Ha!, kid I know what a customer wants the moment they enter my shop, you see this place is magical and shows up when a person has a strong desire. And your strong desire was to-“<br />
<br />
“Ok, I got it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh ok, well I can sell you this for $5.00.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, why do you need the money?”<br />
<br />
“Kid don’t ask. It’s a secret, well my secret.”<br />
<br />
“Ok not going to ask.” Paying the 5 dollar fee the lady tossed the pendant to Alex.<br />
<br />
“Keep that safe ya hear, if anything happens to that pendant. There is no way to undo anything, and I have to make one from scratch, which is gonna be a huge pain so keep that safe.”<br />
<br />
As he left the store he grabbed his bike, looking back at the place he surprisingly find that it was now an empty store. He soon pedaled it to his house, almost crashing because of a bump in the pavement. When he was finally home he ran to his room and locked the door. His parents were out, and his little sis was sleeping peacefully in the next room (Don’t worry, she was locked tight when Alex left.) that gave him time to look at the pendant closely. It was a circle encased with gold while silver lined the edges making a branch line that ran directly to the middle before coming to a spiral.<br />
<br />
He soon closed his eyes and wished, thinking of the rabbit girl he wanted before saying “I wish I was a rabbit girl.” The words exploded from his mouth, in the moment of excitement he said what came to mind. That is what he truly wanted, he didn’t like how everyone treated him so he gonna change himself to be what he wants.<br />
<br />
And just like that he felt sensations all over his body, he removed his clothes just so he doesn’t rip standing naked in his bedroom, he saw that white patches of hair started to grow. Gasping in amazement he quickly put the pendant on his desk and laid onto his bed the sensations were pleasurable, that he had to release his load as sperm covered the bed he was enjoying it. Little by little his member shrunk before sliding into a cleft, the white fur sprouting not long after.<br />
<br />
His body began to take on a more feminine frame his hips growing wider to fit his new cleft. His legs were fully covered in fur as his feet lengthened to rabbit feet before growing pink foot pads. He sprouted a little tail rabbit tail that wiggled under him before he turned over. Alex was moaning now the effects were taking place. The fur reached up to his chest before growing 2 DD sized breasts. His hands also changed though only having paw pads and now claws. His face changed as his ears stretched to the top of his head as a short muzzle lengthened from his face before fully covered. The transformation was complete. <br />
<br />
Hopping around Alex was very speedy, She couldn’t believe what had happened to her hopping back onto her bed she began to pleasure herself by groping her butt and breasts. <br />
<br />
She was in heaven although it needed something extra.</p>
