<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well,&quot; she said, raising up from the couch.  &quot;I feel kind of dirty, so I'm going to shower off.&quot;  She stood up, giving me another nice view of her shapely ass.  I didn't move from the couch, still too overcome from the feelings of the past few minutes.  She stopped walking, turned her head, and asked &quot;Are you coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sprang off the couch, nearly tripping as I did.  She laughed at me and said, &quot;Don't hurt yourself.&quot;  I smirked at her sarcastically and she said, &quot;Now that's no way to treat me right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
She laughed again, &quot;I'm just teasing.  You're so good.&quot;  She led me into her bathroom, which took us through her bedroom first.  Again, she had a nice setup considering it was so small.  Her bathroom was also very small.  She had a shower stall and a bathtub, which I found surprising for an apartment this size.<br />
<br />
She opened the door to the shower and turned the water on.  She was about to step in when I asked, &quot;Are we both going to fit in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you just fix it if you're so concerned?&quot; she said, batting her eyes.<br />
<br />
She turned around and the shower had doubled in size, thanks to my wish.  We spent our time letting the water run over us as we held each other closely.  We kissed a few times but neither of us made a move to initiate sex.<br />
<br />
Kelly handed me a bar of soap and commaned, &quot;Wash me.&quot;  I took great pleasure in running the soap all over her body, especially over her breasts and ass.  I let her return the favor to me.  She seemed to enjoy running her hands over my cock again.<br />
<br />
After we had washed each other, we let the shower continue to run.  The warmth of the water made it so that neither of us wanted to leave.  &quot;Did you enjoy yourself?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Joe.  I want to be honest with you.  You weren't my first time,&quot; she said.  I had assumed as much but didn't know of course.  &quot;I hope you're not disappointed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not,&quot; I said.  &quot;I can't make you apologize for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hugged me tightly.  &quot;Good,&quot; she said.  &quot;Because I think we have something here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two feelings passed over me.  The first was of absolute joy and celebration.  I had admired this girl, well, women is much more appropriate, for a long time.  Now it seemed she was willing to start a relationship with me.  And it was all thanks to this ring.<br />
<br />
The problem was that at the same time I still felt enormously guilty.  I had used the ring to take advantage of her without her knowing.  At first it was by accident, but then I did it again, very much intentionally.  And she was being honest with me.  How could I make her settle for anything less?<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we have something, too,&quot; I finally responded.  &quot;But I have to be honest with you.  And I really hope that you don't get mad.&quot;  I stopped and took a good long look at her naked body, just in case I never had the chance to see it again.  She looked so beautiful with the water cascading down her perfect figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Joe?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember earlier today, when you screamed on the sidewalk and then saw me?&quot; I asked.  She nodded.  &quot;Why do you think you screamed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know why,&quot; she said, playfully pushing me away, &quot;Because I had lost my mail key.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you think it's strange you screamed on a busy sidewalk over a lost key?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Kelly thought for a second and a wave of confusion swept across her face.  &quot;Yea, I do,&quot; she said.  &quot;Why, what are you trying to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
I confessed.  &quot;I didn't believe this ring was real.  So I looked across from where I was standing and wished for the clothes of the woman I was looking at to disappear.  It turns out that it was you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The look of confusion on her face was replaced by one of shock.  It seemed that the truth had set her free.  &quot;I remember now,&quot; she said.  &quot;I was naked.  On the street!  That's why I screamed!  You did that?&quot; she demanded.  I looked down at my feet and confirmed.  &quot;Oh my God,&quot; I heard her mutter.<br />
<br />
I fully expected her to slap me across the face.  In fact I braced myself for it to happen.  But it didn't.  I looked back up and she appeared to still be playing things back in her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, how did I end up with my clothes back on again?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wished them back because I felt guilty about what I had done,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you do it right away or did you get a good look first?&quot; her voice said sternly.<br />
<br />
Ashamed and convinced I had just ruined my life, I said, &quot;I let my dick think and I got a good look.&quot;  She didn't say anything for a minute so I confessed again.  &quot;I also made you topless for a brief minute in the diner because you were testing me.  That was stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing was said or done for a minute.  Finally she answered me.  &quot;Joe, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't mad.  But what I can't figure out is why no one else reacted like I was naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wished they wouldn't,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yea.  That makes sense,&quot; she said.  &quot;Joe I am very upset with you.  But I think I've seen that you're not a mean-natured person.  So I'm not going to get mad at you.&quot;  An immediate sense of relief washed over me.  &quot;But,&quot; she snapped me into focus once more, &quot;If you want there to be something between us, which I do, you'll have to promise not to do things like that to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could see that she meant what she had said.  &quot;I promise I'll never use this power to take advantage of you again,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; she said, &quot;you should wish never to take advantage of me.  That way I won't have to worry.&quot;  Seeing that I was about to protest, she said, &quot;Joe, it's not that I don't trust you.  It's just that from what I've seen, I don't think any person could resist that kind of temptation.  I know I couldn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt better about myself now.  Through her forgiveness, she had further demonstrated to me that she truly was the perfect woman.  I inhaled deeply and said, &quot;I wish that I would never use this ring to take advantage of you unless you otherwise consented.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, why did you say that?&quot; she demanded with anger in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm still not sure what this thing can do,&quot; I explained, &quot;If I didn't say that, then it might not let me do anything to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Showing a bit of disgust on her face she asked, &quot;What would be so bad about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you were the one that asked me to change your hair color,&quot; I reasoned.  &quot;What if you wanted to have some fun, or something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face softened, as did the tone of her voice.  &quot;Yea I guess you're right,&quot; she said.  &quot;And it would seem that I'd have to say OK first, so that won't be a problem.&quot;  She leaned back into me and kissed me on the lips.  &quot;Thanks for being honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stopped the shower and opened the door.  Dripping wet she stepped outside and grabbed two towels.  She tossed one in at me and we dried ourselves off.  As a dried myself off, she wrapped her towel around her waist and plugged in her hair dryer.  &quot;Can't have split ends,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or sopping wet hair, right?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; she giggled.<br />
<br />
I found it interesting the way she wore her towel.  So I called her on it.  &quot;Why did you wrap your towel around your waist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As opposed to where?&quot; she questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh--around, around your chest I guess,&quot; I stuttered.<br />
<br />
She turned to face me and asked, &quot;You have a problem with my breasts or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
I put my foot in my mouth.  &quot;No, I-I'm just dumb.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed histerically and I found myself laughing along with her.  Her breast shook when she laughed.  I couldn't help but be shallow about it.  She regained her composure and said, &quot;I know what you meant.  You would just expect me to normally do that.  Well I guess I don't have a problem with you looking at my breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
I finished drying off my hair and went to find my clothes while she dried her hair.  I walked back into her living room and couldn't find them anywhere.  I looked on the couch, under the couch, everywhere.  They were nowhere to be seen.  I heard the sound of the hair dryer stop as I walked back to the bathroom.  Kelly was drying off her legs at the time.  &quot;Hey, our clothes aren't out there,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Huh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it hit me.  &quot;Wait, I know.  I wished we were naked.  So our clothes just disappeared.  I'll have to wish them back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could,&quot; Kelly said slowly, like she had some kind of idea.  &quot;I've got an idea, though.&quot;</p>
