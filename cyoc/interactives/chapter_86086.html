<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Holding his plate of cookies he finds Jim in his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Here you go baby. I made you some cookies.<br />
<br />
In a deep voice, almost like James Earl Jones, Jim says Oh you know what I like.<br />
<br />
Jake pulls down the tight orange spandex and exposes a rather large cock spring to life. Jake drops his clothes on the floor and climbs up on Jim and lowers himself down onto Jim&#39;s massive cock. He had never thought he would be a bottom but it just seemed right to him with Jim.<br />
<br />
He placed the plate of cookies on his chest and as he rose and fell slowly on Jim&#39;s cock he fed him one after another cookie until the plate was empty. But Jim hadn&#39;t yet cum. When the plate was empty he started to rise and fall faster and faster until a shower of cum coated his insides.<br />
<br />
Being exhausted he laid down on Jim&#39;s chest and Jim wrapped his arms around him holding them together as his cock softened and exited Jake&#39;s worn hole.<br />
<br />
Jake liked big men and had planted that in the chornivac for Jim but he didn&#39;t want to just make him big he wanted to be part of the process. This was the start. He would get Jim to associate sex with food and as he did his ride would become much more exciting.<br />
<br />
Jake wanted to blow those spandex orange pants off of Jim but he would wait for that. It was just as exciting for him to know that soon he wouldn&#39;t be able to fit into those and Jake would make him wear them as they went out. He would jiggle his growing belly and his over stuffed ass in his spandex assortment.<br />
<br />
As the months went by Jim did grow. Looking more like the great pumpkin in his orange spandex than the slim boy he had started out. And still he wasn&#39;t that big. He had just gone up to a bit over 225 and the paunch was starting. This was when Jake graduated to rubber suits for Jim. They were much more stretchy and would hold his form more noticeably than the baggy shirts Jim had taken to wearing over his spandex.<br />
<br />
This went on for more months and grow Jim did. <br />
<br />
As he grew Jake noticed Jim salivating as the pizza would arrive or the table was set. But not only that Jim&#39;s cock would grow rigid whenever he saw food. Walking by a dunkin donuts sent him into spasms.<br />
<br />
As the rubber suit grew and Jake&#39;s stance when he was riding Jim grew wider Jake noticed something that he hadn&#39;t planned on. He made Jim a top, not a total top, but a top and he thought that as Jim got fatter his cock would be hidden in a layer of fat but it grew too. Longer and thicker. He grew furrier and had a carpet on his chest running down the treasure trail to his growing cock. That voice just kept booming as he would feed Jim in bed and those rubber suits would ride up his belly becoming a rubber bra for the man boobs he was sporting.<br />
<br />
Now was the time for Jake to have Jim graduate to the leather daddy he really wanted. He got Jim a leather vest. Now Jake wanted Jim&#39;s chest to be exposed so it looked like he had gotten one too small but if you looked at his back you noticed that it fit perfectly but the front panels weren&#39;t meant to meet exposing the hairy cleavage and the 80 inch belly poking straight out. The only thing straight on Jim now even his cock had a curve that hugged his growing belly. The leather chaps exposing his meaty back end and a leather thong that went up his ass separating the cheeks into two large orbs turned on many men not just Jake.<br />
<br />
Jim thought it was his idea but Jake had long ago put the idea that he would be Jim&#39;s cub when he became a bear leather daddy. So when Jim came home with the leather shorts and leather vest for Jake he knew the program was coming to it&#39;s conclusion.<br />
<br />
Jim would wrap his arm around Jake as they went into bars as though this was all his idea but there was a deep notion that he was straight and this was all wrong but it was buried so deep that it had to be a dream. That nagging little idea that many must have that told him he wasn&#39;t this way but as they walked in the contrast was so magnificent. The sheer size  difference would have been quite noticeable. But it was also the furriness of Jim that was in contrast to Jake&#39;s smooth body. The beard that hung like a bikers was in stark contrast to the smooth chin he insisted Jake maintain. Jim&#39;s beard also hid a multitude of chins.<br />
<br />
The boys flocked to this daddy bear but he was a one man daddy and Jake&#39;s ass showed the wear and tear Jim&#39;s now massive cock had on Jake.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac was lost and even if Jake had wanted to change anything back he wasn&#39;t able to because it had been stolen one day while Jim and Jake were at an all you can eat buffet.</p>
