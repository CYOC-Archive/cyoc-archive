<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tristan sighed. It was his birthday and at 18 it was pretty obvious his childhood had passed by. Having grown up on internet and electronics he felt that he had probably missed something. He had a few figurines and other things that could loosely be considered a toy, but his playthings were all virtual. Certain movies surroundings toys were cute, and he understood what toys were for... He just didn&#39;t feel the need to use them when he had games on game consoles or entertainment on tablets. Then as more time passed he felt less and less need to use his imagination as he was guided through so much curated content. Then with school he had to be creative, but rarely would he dwell in the insanity of the lands of imagination. Years have passed and now instead of being an unimaginative kid he was just an unimaginative adult now. He had his college prep done and everything seemed set up for his life. He was now snug in his bed perfectly made and... he was just tired... <br />
<br />
The Sun was out and shining to keep things warm, a slight breeze was blowing to keep things not too warm, and Sarah&#39;s backyard was as fun as ever. There was a small play structure with swings and a slide, a sandbox, a small inflatable pool that wasn&#39;t inflated, and so much grass to run through. Papa was away at work and Mama wanted some me time so Sarah was unleashed out holding a small doll house. Giddy the young 6 year old ran out to play with an entire universe in her mind. After tiring herself out a little bit running to the top of the slide and sliding down, Sarah started to catch her breath while playing with her toys. She had her Barbie she called Sana, the little dog toy she called Todo, and oh no! She forgot the Ken doll. Oh well she&#39;d just make do with IMAGINATION! <br />
<br />
As Tristan got into his dream state he noticed it was really bright in his dream, and now he was sitting right next to a barbie doll being held by a giant kid&#39;s hand. He looked to the girl the hand was connected to and was wondering if he had so little imagination that he was dreaming he was someone else&#39;s imaginary plaything. &quot;Huh...? Wha?&quot; was all Tristan was muttering in his dream-like state. <br />
<br />
Sarah spoke while shaking Sana around &quot;You were asleep Tristan, A little tired before we go to space!&quot; her voice getting steadier as she was finishing catching her breath. As the girl was so hyperactive that she may have willed someone else&#39;s consciousness into her play space she  took her Sana while imagining Tristan to scale next to the swing. &quot;Come on board the spaceship!&quot; <br />
Tristan said &quot;No.... There&#39;s no room any-&quot; then his eyes bulged as a cockpit formed around Sarah with enough space for herself, a now adult sized Sana, and room for a third person. <br />
&quot;Come on! Come on! To SPACE!!!&quot;<br />
Tristan tripped as he was backing away and said &quot;But what if we blow up?&quot; As he was looking more at the forming space craft it looked more like some futuristic plane instead of a spaceship. <br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go Tristan! It&#39;ll be fine and it&#39;s Space! SPACE!! We&#39;ll head to the moon to grab some cheese, and then go keep Pluto company!&quot;<br />
Tristan shook his head and said &quot;No, I am staying here on Earth.&quot; <br />
&quot;But Space and Pluto and He&#39;s Lonely!&quot; Sarah started to get upset and throwing a bit of a tantrum. <br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s mother looked out to the backyard to see her daughter crying alone on the swing set with her barbie in her hand. She sighed and went outside asking &quot;Sarah? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; <br />
Sarah pointed to thin air and said &quot;Tristan wont go to space with me!&quot;<br />
Tristan being there in spirit was really confused, but Sarah&#39;s mom said &quot;Well, you&#39;ve got Sana. Maybe you could find someone else in the wild grass forest?&quot; Sarah picked up on the idea and Tristan felt his imaginary body dissolve, things got dimmer and then he saw giant blades of grass.<br />
&quot;I think I hear someone over here!&quot; Sarah&#39;s voice came from behind a blade of grass which then got cut down. On the other side seemed to be Sana and Sarah who imagined herself in an explorer&#39;s outfit with a machete. Eye&#39;s locked Sarah said &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Sarah? Who are you?&quot; <br />
Tristan looked at himself and saw his body seemed to be smaller and pudgier... and was covered in &quot;clothes&quot; made of large grass blades. Sarah then took out a space ship out of her pocket an-<br />
<br />
Tristan woke up, that amount of insanity was just too... He noticed some things were wrong. There was sun shining, he was in a car... no not just that but was in a booster seat in a car... and wearing a dress. <br />
&quot;Up Trish?&quot; his mother asked. Trish nodded as his mother said &quot;We&#39;re coming up to our new house. It&#39;ll be real nice with a lot of space, and there&#39;ll be a lot of kids around your age.&quot;<br />
his father chuckled and said &quot;Yeah she&#39;ll care a lot about them. or she&#39;ll just stare at a tablet all day.&quot; The car slowed as they parked next to the sidewalk as the movers were still hard at work. Tristan&#39;s mind was spiraling thinking whether or not he was still dreaming or something, and while thinking Tristan walked with her mom to a house next to the house they were moving to and knocked. Her mother had reached out to some of the neighbors and noticed this one had a little girl as well a year or two older than Trish. The mothers were talking about something... then a voice came out loud. <br />
&quot;Found the girl from the Grass Forest!&quot; now both Tristan&#39;s girl form and that girl&#39;s form being equally real Tristan could feel Sarah&#39;s grasp as she pulled Tristan through the house to the backyard. Which worked out since the mothers were talking about letting the two kids play together as the movers were a little behind schedule. <br />
All Tristan knew what he could do was...</p>
