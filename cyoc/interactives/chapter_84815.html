<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they explored the room they noticed very little of interest. The old man had apparently not believed in hording all of his goods. Tiffany was starting to get bored of the library when all of a sudden Katie let loose a gasp of delight!<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiff! Look at what I just found!&quot; Katie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Katie had been searching behind a pile of dusty books sitting precariously in the corner of the room and now she pulled out a lamp, so dusty that it looked like a ball of dust shaped like a lamp. Now that she had extracted it from the corner she brought it to one of the tables sitting next to the comfy chairs in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t it look old? I wonder where he would have found something like this?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
Tiffany wasn&#39;t sure about that, she had seen a lot of good looking antiques that ended up being nothing but junk. Her bet was that this was the case with this lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie, I think it&#39;s just something he found at a garage sale. It looks pretty fake to me. Here, let me wipe away some of this dust. I bet we&#39;ll find a &quot;Made in China&quot; label underneath it all.&quot; Tiffany was explaining as she started to brush the dust away.<br />
<br />
Just then, the dust started to glow with an eerie light, and the room started to shake. The dull dust on the lamp started to glow in bright colors and light was started to pour out of the top of it. Katie was squealing with delight while Tiffany could do nothing but stare in astonishment. She certainly hadn&#39;t expected THAT reaction from the old man&#39;s trinkets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Tiff!!&quot; Katie was saying, &quot;It must be a magic lamp! I wonder if we&#39;ll have a genie and everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
It seemed at that moment that Katie was right, as the dust fell from the ceiling it all suddenly stopped. The rainbow colored particles stood suspended in midair, as if time had ceased to exist inside the room. Then, all of a sudden they started to swirl, faster and faster, around the room until all they could see were bright swashes of color surrounding them. And then suddenly everything stopped spinning and there was a small glowing light above the lamp, glowing with the colors that had been swirling around them. It pulsed a gentle light that soothed them and made them feel at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings my friends...&quot; said a voice in their minds, &quot;I want to thank you for releasing me, it has been many years since I was last back on Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie was hard-pressed to contain her excitement, she was basically dancing in place and Tiffany was feeling a little bit embarrassed even though the only person in the room with them seemed to be a glowing orb of light.<br />
<br />
Katie couldn&#39;t contain her questions any longer, &quot;Are you a genie!? Did we just get wishes by letting you out of that magic lamp!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany couldn&#39;t tell for certain, but she felt a faint feeling of resignation and amusement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, yes...I am a genie and YES you do get your wishes. two for each of you in fact.&quot; the genie stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, two wishes?! What about our 3 wishes?&quot; Katie was pouting loudly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the orb of light puffed up a bit bigger and glowed an eerie red. Tiff was wondering if it was really a good idea to be bartering (or bullying) a genie. She had decided that she was just going to let Katie deal with this though, she didn&#39;t really think she wanted to get involved with magic if she could help it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The reason you only get TWO wishes, and yes, you will only be receiving two wishes each, is because there are in fact two of you. I normally grant three wishes to a single person, but since there are two of you I am only entitled to grant you two wishes each. I think that is more than reasonable! If you want more than go find yourselves another genie!&quot;, as the genie said all of this he started to get a little bit smaller and the red light dimmed to a rosy pink. It was fairly obvious from his tone that he was more than a little annoyed. &quot;At any rate, what exactly would you like your first wish to be? The sooner we get this over with the sooner I can return home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany knew exactly what Katie was going to ask for, she fantasized over this sort of thing every day. As Katie thought about it, she calmed down slightly and smiled up at the genie, &quot;I want a boyfriend!&quot; Katie was saying, &quot;Someone who really understands me and will love me for who I am. I&#39;m tired of having boyfriends that are insensitive and rude...&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie looked (at least the glow got brighter) in Katie&#39;s direction, and Tiffany sensed a satisfied emotion from the genie, &quot;And now what would you like oh silent one?&quot; the genie was asking her, &quot;I haven&#39;t heard so much as a peep out of you yet. I have to say I rather like that, it&#39;s different for a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany was conflicted, on one hand she had always wondered what she would ask for if such an opportunity came up, but she was absolutely dumbfounded now that it was here. &quot;Well...&quot; she started, &quot;I guess it would be fairly similar, I&#39;d like to find my true love. Someone who will love me and cherish me as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
The orb of light that was the genie seemed to consider something, and then all of sudden it glowed a light blue. Tiffany couldn&#39;t be certain but she though she detected...laughter in the way the genie was acting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of your wishes...have been granted.&quot; the genie said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a bright light hit Tiffany in the middle of her chest, and she fell down to one knee gasping for air. The light remained surrounding her, filling her with an intense feeling of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Katie looked appalled, &quot;Tiff! What did you do that for!?&quot; Katie turned to yell at the genie, &quot;What does that have to do with either of our wishes!?&quot; Katie was shouting at the genie.<br />
<br />
There was no doubt now, the genie was most definitely laughing in his own way. &quot;I have indeed granted both of your wishes, and at the same time even! Maybe you should watch the show and you&#39;ll start to understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked back at Tiffany in concern, noting with surprise that all of Tiffany&#39;s clothing had disappeared. Suddenly she noticed something unusual, Tiffany had always been ridiculously skinny, probably a result of being so tall, but it seemed now that she looked slightly less so. Tiffany&#39;s long brown hair was looking messy and disheveled as she started to gasp and groan in what sounded like pain mixed with pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god Katie, it feels so stra...&quot; Tiffany started and then she caught her breath. Suddenly she felt as though she couldn&#39;t talk and now there was a pressure near her groin. She looked down and what she saw would have made her stop talking anyway. A small mound of flesh had just descended from her groin and her vagina was nowhere to be found, it was as if it had never existed in the first place. Suddenly Tiff thought back to the wish that Katie had made, she had wished for a BOYFRIEND! With a sudden flash of insight, Tiffany realized that she was going to become that boyfriend! Katie must be her true love if Tiffany had been born a boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, your friend is quite insightful Katie.&quot; the genie was saying, &quot;She&#39;s figured it out pretty quickly. Here&#39;s the thing about when two people find a genie&#39;s lamp, you may both get your wish...but it&#39;s usually tied up together somehow. In this case in order for you both to find your true love, someone needs to be a guy. You two would have been soul mates had one of you been born a guy, so Tiffany wins the prize!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie was looking completely overwhelmed, &quot;Tiff!! I didn&#39;t know! I&#39;m sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany was far too involved with her own issues to hear Katie at the moment, things were starting to speed up and she was feeling pleasure all over her body. The small sack of flesh that had descended had grown and now she felt two things drop into it, each one feeling like a hit to the gut, but she was so enraptured by the joy that she barely felt them. As her newly developed testes finished they moved slowly into position as another mound of flesh started to emerge from above. As it pushed out, Tiffany noticed that the pleasure erupting all over her body was now focusing into a specific region, all of her pleasure now coming from this new organ pushing it&#39;s way out of her body. As it became longer and thicker she found herself running her fingers over it. As if encouraged by her touch, her new penis grew out even longer, until she could easily wrap her hand around it and start to stroke. <br />
<br />
Katie was simultaneously repulsed and curious about Tiffany&#39;s changes, even though it was strange....this was her wish and Tiffany was about to become her new boyfriend. She was curious exactly how she...or he...would turn out. As Tiffany was playing with her new equipment, Katie was enjoying the view as well. Tiffany had grown out to a respectable size, about 6 inches or so completely erect and she looked as though she was enjoying herself. Katie found herself inching closer and closer until she was very close. <br />
<br />
Tiffany at that moment was completely engrossed in her new penis, it was bringing her pleasure beyond anything that she had ever felt before. As she stroked she felt a new sensation creeping around her new penis, but she was unable to open her eyes....she was so overcome by the pleasure that she couldn&#39;t do anything other than stroke. Katie however noticed what the new sensation was, and she was watching with interest. When Tiffany had been a full girl, she had kept herself shaved completely down there, but as Tiffany stroked her penis, that hair started to grow back. Hairs started to pop up, slowly at first, and then fast as Tiffany&#39;s progression into a boy started to work itself all over her body. The new testes were pumping testosterone to her in ways that she had never felt as a girl, and as she stroked she was feeling strong and powerful.<br />
<br />
The hairs started to wind their way around her new genitalia and then climb higher, showing signs of developing a happy trail. Meanwhile the hairs were also starting to form on her normally smooth legs, creating a rippling effect as they grew longer and faster. And as the hairs finished on her legs, looking strange for a second, the structure of her legs started to change as well. As Tiffany was grunting in a still very feminine voice, her legs became bigger and stronger. Katie noticed that her feet were also changing, her entire bottom half becoming stronger and more muscular, much more like the guy that she was becoming. Katie even thought she noticed the legs stretching a little bit, as if Tiffany was growing a few inches in height as well. Looking up, she could see that was the case, Tiffany had always been taller than her, but now she seemed to have gained a few more inches on her. As Tiffany&#39;s feet finished their structural change the hair on her legs continued down, finishing up on her feet. Looking at Tiffany&#39;s new legs, Katie started to feel herself craving the end of this change. She couldn&#39;t believe that she was finally going to have her perfect boyfriend!<br />
<br />
Tiffany had barely noticed any of this though, although she had felt the slight adjustment to her new legs as an interesting sort of inflating sensation. The hairs growing in had been felt as an odd tickling sensation. Suddenly she felt the pleasure building in a strange new way, and as it started to build her legs gave way beneath her. &quot;AUGH!!!&quot; Tiffany cried out. As she cried out from the feeling of her first male orgasm she hit Katie straight in the face with a small amount of her cum. Katie, who had been looking at Tiffany&#39;s new bottom half was taken by surprise, but quickly smiled as Tiffany looked down at her new bottom half for the first time panting heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god...&quot; Tiffany gasped as she got back, &quot;What the hell happened to my legs!&quot; as she was exclaiming this, her penis started to slowly deflate. As she got back up to her feet she started to feel the muscles and the hair on her new lower half. &quot;Geez, I feel so weird. I can&#39;t even believe that I have a penis! Your wish didn&#39;t turn out like I&#39;d expected Katie! You think he can change me back with the second wish? Let&#39;s make the new wish now ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie rather liked the way Tiffany was turning out though, and since the changes only seemed to happen while she was being pleasured, she decided to take it upon herself to finish the job. She leaned down to where Tiffany&#39;s new equipment was and started to glance up at Tiffany, it was strange for her to see her old friend normal past the waste and to have the male legs beneath her. Tiffany looked aghast and started to back up towards the wall and then promptly fell on her feet. She was unfamiliar with her new legs and couldn&#39;t keep her balance yet. &quot;Katie! What are you doing! Stop that!&quot; Tiffany was yelling.<br />
<br />
Katie looked into her friend&#39;s eyes as she leaned down to where her penis was, &quot;Sorry Tiffany, but I actually like the way you are turning out...and I think you&#39;ll enjoy it too once you see what I can do for you.&quot; With that said, Katie got a mischievous look in her eyes and she slowly started to give Tiffany her first blowjob. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh!! Ohhhh!!!&quot; Tiffany was exclaiming in her still female voice. She thought back to the pleasure she had felt when she was pleasuring herself, and that had been nothing...absolutely NOTHING compared to what she was feeling right now.<br />
<br />
As Katie continued to suck, Tiffany felt the surge of hormones and feeling return...wiping away any fears or doubts. She just let herself be swept up in the feelings. As this was going on, the changes started to continue, the hair that had stopped earlier as the faint thought of a happy trail started to curl upwards again, curling around her belly button. But the most drastic change was happening to her breasts. When Katie had started to suck, Tiffany&#39;s nice big breasts had started to deflate in size...just a little. As the seconds passed though, those breasts were shrinking at an alarming rate. <br />
<br />
Katie was enjoying herself immensely as she sucked on Tiffany&#39;s cock, and as she looked up...she knew she had been right. Tiffany&#39;s breasts had just finished shrinking away, leaving her completely flat...or at least for now. As she continued to keep Tiffany entertained, she noticed the flat chest starting to inflate again, but this time it was with muscle. As a small trail of hair started to wind its way up to the middle of her now flattened chest, her abs were tightening up and becoming more defined while her pectorals were stretching out with rock hard muscles. As the pectorals tightened up, Tiffany&#39;s shoulders started to widen as well, giving her a nice wide and strong stance. As the hair reached the middle of her chest, it started to fan out lightly. It was obvious that Tiffany was not going to be a hairy guy, but she was obviously going to have a little bit of fur on her chest.<br />
<br />
Tiffany felt all of this happening to her, but it was all far away as she stayed lost in the pleasure that Katie was bringing her. &quot;Oh god Katie, this feels amazing!&quot; she exclaimed. It was still strange to hear her normal voice coming out of her mostly male body, but a small voice in her head told her it wouldn&#39;t be long...and she was starting to look forward to it. As the testosterone coursed through her body she felt the intense heat spread into her arms. She couldn&#39;t help but flex them as she looked to see them broaden and inflate with muscle. As the arms expanded, she watched a moderate coating of hair cover the tops of her forearms and she felt the tickle and the hair filled in under her arms. But those small sensations were nothing to the feeling of raw energy she felt as she flexed her muscles and watched Katie sucking her dick. It all felt...so right.<br />
<br />
Katie noticed the way that Tiffany was looking at her arms and now she noticed that Tiffany&#39;s face was starting to go through some changes of its own. The long brown hair was growing backwards into her skull, regressing until nothing was left but a nice short, messy cut. Tiffany&#39;s neck started to thicken with muscle as her jawline reshaped itself from its previously soft dainty lines into a angular, chiseled jawline and her chin grew a light coating of stubble. Her eyebrows thickened and her nose grew just a bit, and all in all her facial structure was thickening and broadening in ways that reminded Katie of Tiffany as a girl. If Tiffany had a brother she imagined this would have been what he would have looked like. As the final touches finished on Tiffany&#39;s new face, she gasped out loud and started to grunt. <br />
<br />
Tiffany cried out, &quot;Katie!! I feeeeEEEEeeelllLL stttTTrrrAAnNgggEEE!!&quot; and now Tiffany&#39;s voice was changing, the changes to her neck were now showing a protruding adam&#39;s apple emerging, and Tiffany&#39;s voice was shifting downward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh!!! I think it&#39;s aLMOOOOst over!&quot; Tiffany was crying out in pleasure, her voice now more male than female....still cracking a little bit but definitely showing signs of deepening just past a tenor into a rich baritone.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Katie felt the rush as Tiffany exploded into her mouth, sending her...no HIS...salty seed into her mouth. She gulped it down, enjoying the taste of her new boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Tiffany was still gasping on the ground as Katie looked down, and now she saw him completely as he was to be. He was just perfect for her, he was lean and muscular and the light bit of hair on his body gave him the perfect look of maturity, while still looking young and eager. <br />
<br />
As Tiffany continued to gasp for breath, Katie cuddled up next to him and put her arms around him. As she ran her hands through the light coat of hair on his chest she gave him a mischievous look as he looked down at her, still looking out of sorts. &quot;So we definitely need to decide on a new name for you, I don&#39;t think Tiffany is going to cut it anymore.&quot; Katie smiled at him.</p>
