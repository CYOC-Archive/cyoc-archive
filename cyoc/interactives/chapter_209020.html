<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler whined as he stared at the computer screen and before he was able to stop himself, a very fox-like bark of frustration escaped him. Surprised by the noise, he pulled away from the laptop and stood up on the chair. Bushy fox tail raised and switching back and forth in alarm, he wondered to himself, &quot;Noise come from me?&quot; and scared that there was other things that he didn&#39;t know about that had been changed, he struggled to articulate aloud, but found it difficult, as most of what he said didn&#39;t make sense, or was mangled, and came off a mix of human speech and the sounds a fox would make.<br />
<br />
Disturbed by this sudden turn, it gradually came to him that he was again standing on fours. Forgetting his inability to properly articulate like a human, he tried to make himself either stand up on two legs or sit down in the seat like a human would. Finding he was unable to make himself do either, he grew agitated when the most he was able to do was to sit like an animal would on a piece of furniture. Gripping the seat tight with his still human hands, he curled his tail so that it wrapped around his paws and hands. Thinking, “Need fix. How?” he was distracted when he shifted about in place, wound up scooting forward, and in the process the palm of his hands ended up pressed against his female genitals.<br />
<br />
With a soft moan of pleasure of how good the touch felt, as well as the sense of his parts rubbing against the chair, he shifted in place. Sitting so that he was more on his thigh, vixen parts more exposed, he teased his clit with one finger a moment before he traced it up and down his slit. Liking the feel, thinking back to what he’d done on the bed, he glanced at the computer, and with a start understood what he was close to doing, as well as that there was something else he need to take care of.<br />
<br />
The answer he knew lay somehow in the what he saw, that much he could grasp. But with his limited human mind, he was unable to understand and figure out how. Launching himself forward so that his hands landed on the desk whilst his paws remained on the seat, oblivious to how much he looked like an animal standing the way he was, he twitched his tail back and forth as he tried to make sense of the programme that was running. A whine escaped him and in a tentative manner, he reached out and patted at the keyboard. Watching as the screen split and a second screen pulled up, Tyler cocked his head to the side and he tried to figure what happened. Finding out instead that the words on the display made no sense, he whimpered, thought, &quot;I no read?&quot; before he again sat back down in the chair, curled his tail around his hands and paws, and stared blankly at the screen.<br />
<br />
On the floor, the sex doll that was Jeff had at least a partial view of the laptop. Able to see that somehow his brother had pulled up his profile, he started to mentally scream, &quot;Don&#39;t you dare do anything to me, you twerp. I&#39;m not going to spend the rest of my life like this. And as soon as the timer runs out and I turn back, I&#39;ll make you pay for messing with stuff that isn&#39;t yours,&quot; as he watched his brother leap from the chair, pace about like a agitated animal, then jump back up onto the chair and place his hands in front of the laptop in way that made Jeff think of a cat or dog when it stood with their hind feet on a chair and their front paws on a counter or other surface.<br />
<br />
Tyler, in a vague, sluggish way, understood that he was losing himself to the fox. There was still enough of his mental faculties to grasp this, but other higher functions were slowly being stripped from him. Memories of his life as Tyler were growing fuzzy, whilst his education, what he&#39;d paid attention for, was almost washed away, with only most of what he learned in pre-school and kindergarten still present. Higher functions of an evolved being going dim, he was still able to grasp out what he was to do as he barked out, “No! Not fox! Am me! Want now,” and face-planting into the keyboard in much the same way an animal would use its muzzle or snout, he started to bat at and press keys when it didn&#39;t seem to do anything. Watching as the screen shifted, different displays appeared and disappeared, he had no idea what any of it meant, which made him even more frustrated and angry, causing the sounds he was making to sound more and more fox-like.<br />
<br />
Window and after window popped up, collapsed, and popped up as Tyler pressed random keys, somethings two or three at once. The Chronivac cycling through its programme, options began to turn on and off at random. The map function became active, and unaware that he had done so, he turned on an option to send Jeff to a new location more fitting for what he&#39;d become. Before it could be initiated, the window minimised to the background, and Tyler&#39;s keystrokes brought up his own profile. Somehow managing to bring up a display that asked if changes should be reverted, and hitting the key to accept, he didn&#39;t understand it when the programme told him, &quot;Permanency has been selected and initiated. No original copy of subject exists any longer,&quot; before that too vanished with a slap of the keyboard and his profile, complete with an image of what he&#39;d become, was brought up. Hitting, batting, pecking at, slapping, and pressing keys, struggling to undo what had happened to him, a sliver of him latched onto the notion that if he was able to get rid of the fox tail he&#39;d go back to normal, Tyler failed to ken what it was he was doing as commands were entered, another permanency option was activated, and his brother&#39;s profile was brought back up before he hit a series of keystrokes that initiated a change within both Tyler and Jeff.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t able to tell what exactly his brother was doing. The twerp had managed to move so far forward as he fiddled about, Jeff found he couldn&#39;t tell what Tyler was doing. Growing more and more incensed with every jab, slap, punch and hit of a key, he was caught off guard when a strange sensation washed over him. Thinking it must mean that the timer was up, he had one final thought, &quot;Now you&#39;re going to pay you little dip face,&quot; before the room around him disappeared and he was whisked away to another location.<br />
<br />
Unaware that he&#39;d sent Jeff away, Tyler began to whimper, whine and bark more and more. His changes to the parameters causing his mental state to shift to something closer to five percent human, ninety-five percent animal, he missed it as russet coloured fur stared to grow over his body and black hued fur began to appear over his paws, hands, and lower arms and legs. Oblivious to this, the only thing he found he could focus on was the sensation that rippled through his female privates, seemed to go through out his body, and left him feeling shivery, jittery, and in need. Lifting his tail up and presenting his swollen sex, the vixen&#39;s heat cycle kicking in, and Tyler uttered a female fox&#39;s scream to call for a mate. Failing to get anything in reply, he leapt down off the chair and started to pace back and forth, uttering every so often the same call as his body shifted fully to quadruped and his ears moved up to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
The need getting worse, Tyler soon returned to Jeff&#39;s bed. Missing completely that the sex doll was gone, Tyler leapt up onto the bed and began to sniff at the body excretions she&#39;d left earlier. Not finding anything interesting about them, she stepped away. Rubbing her face into the comforter and sheets, she lifted her back end up. Presenting herself, even as his nose and mouth merged, then started to push out, Tyler soon squatted down as his human teeth fell out and the teeth of carnivore grew in. Rubbing his swollen, aching female sex against the bed linens, he found some relief as he again began to masturbate like a female animal. Tail twitching back and forth furiously, he let forth with a couple more fox sounds, including the blood-curdling scream to let a male know what it was he needed, as he kneaded the comforter until he cummed a second time on the bed. Turning to sniff, finding it only relieved her a little, the vixen looked about the place, which the last shred of Tyler recognised and identified as a bedroom. Leaping down off the bed, she took a moment to clean herself, paying the most attention to needing sex before she stood, stepped across the room and jumped up next to the laptop.<br />
<br />
The machine of little interest to her, she didn’t pay attention as she stepped on the keyboard. The thing making a soft ding that didn’t even bother her, if there had been any large part of Tyler left, she’d recognised the permanency option for her and Jeff was pulled up and activated. Her interest more on what she perceived as a clear opening, she walked toward and put her front paws on it, not understanding what blocked her from the outside where she knew it was safer and that she’d be able to find a male to ease her longing.</p>
