<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was still an hour or so before she had to leave for college, so she rang Lucy. Mercifully, she picked up her phone quickly.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; was what Amy heard. Lucy sounded groggy.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Lucy, it's Amy. I need you to come to mine as soon as you can,&quot; she said, urgently. &quot;Forget college, I have a problem.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Can't it wait?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;No. It can't,&quot; Amy replied. &quot;Please?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Lucy said after a moment's silence. &quot;I'll be there in an hour or so.&quot;<br />
 <br />
An hour and a half later, there was a knock at the door. Amy answered it and thankfully, Lucy was there. Amy ushered her in and offered her a drink, which Lucy declined.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Let's just get this over with,&quot; she said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I wish I could,&quot; Amy said under her breath.<br />
 <br />
Lucy didn't seem to hear her, so Amy made them both a cup of coffee and sat down. She sipped her drink as she tried to figure out how to tell her best friend what had happened to her. She could try and find a way to talk into it or she could come straight out with the shocking truth.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Lucy asked, taking a gulp of coffee. &quot;What's up?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Amy tried to think of words to express what she was feeling, how frightened and confused she was, but she couldn't grasp any. Instead, she stood up and faced Lucy.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I have something to show you,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm confused as to how it happened, but I need to tell someone about it.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Amy had only put on a dressing gown for this, so she undid the belt, still holding it closed.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What the-&quot; Lucy started, before saying, &quot;Hey, no offense, but I'm not into lesbian stuff.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Please!&quot; Amy exclaimed.<br />
 <br />
Lucy just nodded, seeing the worry on her friends features. Amy pulled open her dressing gown. The cock that had been held hidden by the dressing gown flopped down and hung limply between her legs.<br />
 <br />
Lucy looked as if she were in shock. Her eyes were wide, her mouth hanging open. In any normal situation, she'd have looked hilarious, but not in this one.<br />
 <br />
The cock was about a foot and a half long and about 3 inches thick at it's hardest, Amy remembered. At the moment it was about half that and hanging limply.<br />
 <br />
&quot;That has to be fake,&quot; she said, disbelievingly.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I wish it were,&quot; Amy said sadly.<br />
 <br />
Lucy was staring and Amy blushed, and averted her gaze. She did notice, however, Lucy licking her lips unconsciously.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Look at the size of it!&quot; Lucy almost yelled, her face breaking into a slight smile.<br />
 <br />
She was obviously trying to hide her love of such a large cock, and Amy decided to let her think she hadn't noticed. She had other worries, after all.<br />
 <br />
Lucy stood up and made Amy sit down. She then squatted in front of her and rested her hands on Amy's knees to support herself as much as give comfort.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Amy, this is going to be fine,&quot; she said calmly. &quot;We'll figure it out and find someone or some way to make you how you were.&quot;<br />
 <br />
When Amy didn't respond Lucy gave her a little slap on the knee and asked what was wrong.<br />
 <br />
&quot;It'll take forever to sort out, if it's even possible,&quot; Amy said. &quot;And I can't control it.&quot;<br />
 <br />
This made Lucy cock her eyebrow and Amy told her what had happened a while earlier. As she spoke, understanding dawned on Lucy's face and Amy could all but hear the cogs turning and forming a solution.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I can help with that,&quot; Lucy said, unembarrassed.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What happened to not being interested in lesbian stuff?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Lucy said, a smile coming to her face, &quot;with a cock like that, I can make an exception. The bigger the better for me, after all.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Amy sighed in fake exasperation, though her heart was pounding a bruise on the inside of her ribcage. She had to admit, the idea of fucking Lucy with this massive cock was strangely exciting. She barely thought before nodding in agreement.<br />
 <br />
Even as she was nodding, her new appendage was growing hard and long at the thought of fucking her best friend. Before even thirty seconds were up, Amy's cock was so hard, it felt like it was going to burst open from the pressure.<br />
 <br />
A glint came to Lucy's already bright eyes as she admired the sheer length of her friend's unnatural, large horse-cock. She dropped off the couch and looked at it close up, marvelling at how it looked: the slight curve of the 18 inch shaft, the large veins puling with bl**d to keep it hard. Underneath the cock was a set of huge balls, dangling down and swinging slightly as Amy moved.<br />
 <br />
Lucy licked her lips again before leaning in and slowly, gently licking the head of Amy's cock, causing Amy to moan softly.<br />
 <br />
Lucy smiled when she tasted it. It tasted completely different to how she was used to a cock to taste. It was still fleshy tasting, but it was sweet, and the rhythmic pulse of bl**d under the skin was deliciously powerful. It mad her even wetter than she already was.<br />
 <br />
Amy moaned loudly when Lucy engulfed the head of her new cock deeply, pressing it to the back of her throat and licking the underside. She felt as if her cock was about to explode with cum, right down her friend's throat.<br />
 <br />
Lucy sucked hard, bobbing her head hard and fast, her hands, wrapped around the shaft, were stroking with an equal amount of enthusiasm. Amy moaned long and loud and, without warning, came hard. A huge torrent of cum filling Lucy's mouth. Lucy tried to swallow it all, but she couldn't swallow it as fast as Amy's cock could pump it into her mouth, which meant that a lot escaped her lips and dripped down her shin and onto her shirt.<br />
 <br />
She pulled Amy's cock from her mouth, swallowed the last of the cum in her mouth and wiped it on the back of her arm. She then looked down at her top and saw the mess there.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Sorry Lucy,&quot; Amy said, looking embarrassed. &quot;I didn't mean to cover your shirt I cum.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;It's fine,&quot; Lucy said, smiling as she wiped some of it onto her fingers then sucked it off of them and swallowed.<br />
 <br />
She eyed Amy's still-hard cock and took her clothes off. Seeing Lucy naked made Amy's cock twitch and all she wanted to do was jump on her and ram her cock into Lucy's tight pussy and ass, but she fought hard to control her desires.<br />
 <br />
Lucy stood and pushed Amy's dressing gown, which she'd kept on but open, from her shoulders. As it fell to the floor, Lucy took Amy's hand and pulled her to the bedroom. When they got there, Lucy pushed Amy onto the bed and climbed onto it next to her, not even shutting the door behind them.<br />
 <br />
Lucy leaned over and kissed Amy on the lips passionately, her hand slowly rubbing the cock that was now pointing almost straight up at the ceiling. Amy kissed back, moaning slightly, as their tongues found each other and started dancing together. The kiss was long and when it was broken, a thin string of saliva hung between their tongues.<br />
 <br />
Lucy stood on the bed, her feet planted either side of Amy's waist and she slowly lowered herself to a comfortable kneeling position where the cock could be standing proud, but not inside her. Slowly and carefully, she grabbed it and lined it up with her dripping opening before lowering herself further, the head of Amy's cock piercing her tight cunt.<br />
 <br />
Both of them moaned loudly, as if it was a competition to out-moan the other, but in reality, Amy was moaning at her friend's tight pussy and Lucy from being filled so much (even with only two inches of it inside her).<br />
 <br />
When she'd gotten used to the girth of Amy's cock, Lucy pushed down more, until it hit her cervix. As she did, she came from being penetrated so deeply with such a thick cock. She didn't stop there; she pushed even further and harder, and the head of Amy's cock pierced Lucy's tight cervix, penetrating her deeper than she'd ever been penetrated before. Lucy screamed with a mix of extreme pleasure and pain, while Amy moaned at such a tight grip on her cock.<br />
 <br />
Lucy started to move her hips slowly fucking her best friend and both moaned in tandem, a symphony of pleasure and pain that seemed to go perfectly with such an intimate act, and having nothing to so with the size of the cock or depth of penetration.<br />
 <br />
Amy couldn't help herself, she rolled over, putting Lucy underneath her with her legs up and she held them where they were as she started to fuck her friend hard and fast. Lucy started swearing incoherently as she was pounded deeply and hard by Amy's horse-cock, and Amy's balls slapped hard against her ass.<br />
 <br />
Both of them screamed as their orgasms peaked, Lucy squirting cum around Amy's cock, and Amy emptying her big balls directly into Lucy's womb. The amount of cum Amy expelled was so large that it squirted out of Lucy and onto the bed covers.<br />
 <br />
As they both came down from their first orgasms, they hugged and kissed, all inhibitions on the lesbian act gone before drifting off quickly into the post-orgasmic bliss of deep, contented sl**p.<br />
