<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thursday was to a great extent a fairly quiet day as many of the events that would happen that were of note for cast members would be that evening. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In the east, Teddy and Marci Green were getting ready to go, as all of their preparations for their respective vacations were ready. They would have about a week to enjoy plenty of time in Moon Lake and Marci looked forward to seeing her husband finally gain a fur coat of his his own. Both the FBI and the law firm at which Marci worked were happy to see the two take some time off. Both organizations felt that the Greens were great workers and had no complaints with the things they did, but had felt that the two of them seemed to be too dedicated to their work. The only question that some of Teddy&#39;s fellow agents had was that he was vacationing in Moon Lake, where he&#39;d just been on a case. Teddy explained that there was a lot to like about the town.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marci, honey, I&#39;m going to go let the neighbors know about our travel plans and to keep an eye on things,&quot; Ted called to her while Marci focused on packing her bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget the landlord too,&quot; Marci answered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot;  Ted answered.<br />
<br />
Originally they&#39;d planned to head out on Friday afternoon and settle into a motel and look around Moon Lake for a day or two, since Ted&#39;s previous visit was work related and he couldn&#39;t see much and Marci had never been there before. Her parents had grown up there, but had left Moon Lake to pursue a theatrical career, which they were still enjoying. However thanks to some sort of accident that couldn&#39;t be corrected, the airlines had advanced their tickets to Thursday, putting them both in hustle mode to get ready. They wouldn&#39;t lose vacation time and the airlines didn&#39;t make the same mistake with the return flight, but it would mean some hustle to get ready to go.<br />
<br />
As Marci packed her things, a phone rang coming from the nightstand on Teddy&#39;s side of the bed. She cautiously approached it and answered it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Green residence,&quot; Marci answered it, &quot;Marci Green speaking. Whom may I ask is calling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Samantha Twist... I&#39;m...&quot; a feminine voice answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You work in Moon Lake,&quot; Marci gave a smile, &quot;Teddy told me you could help with our present problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; came the slow answer, &quot;and your husband had mentioned that when he was last here... however, he mentioned that there was some issue on what kind of were he&#39;d be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marci blinked. There had been some talk on that every since they&#39;d gotten married and Teddy learned that she was a true werecat, which were only female and at least bisexual, if not complete lesbians. If she had sex with Teddy to change him, she&#39;d kill him. Male werecats were an option, but like true werecats, their strain of the were-virus was mono-gendered and had made it so that they were also at least bisexual, if not homosexual. Marci and Teddy both agreed not to take the risk that while Teddy would become a were that he might also become gay and lose the sexual interest he had in her as well. At the same time, Marci had also stated that she really didn&#39;t have any interest in the various wildcats that male werecats turned into.<br />
<br />
Their agreement had always been that Teddy would become a weretiger, werelion, or wereleopard/panther. It&#39;d be feline and would include the were-felines that had male members, and Marci had always voiced that she thought Teddy would look good as a white weretiger, as it would match her own white Turkish Angora based form that her own fursona was based on quite well. And since Teddy had come home, those talks did resume. In the end, Teddy had agreed to go with the weretiger option, though from what he&#39;d gotten as reading material from Moon Lake on that, there wasn&#39;t much of a guarantee that he would be a white weretiger, even if the weretiger that turns him was also a white weretiger. It was something of a role of the dice, but they had agreed to go that route.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose I can give you good news in that department,&quot; Marci spoke, &quot;Teddy and I have been talking since everything... and have agreed on the weretiger route. Hopefully, he&#39;ll be a white weretiger... with white fur, blue eyes in his fursona with brownish black stripes... but we&#39;ll accept him being a normal weretiger with largely orange fur with greenish gold eyes, black stripes, and a white underbelly and white patches above his eyes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; came Samantha&#39;s answer slowly, &quot;That&#39;ll be good, though, though I will warn you that the tigress we have available that is willing to transform your husband doesn&#39;t have the room to do it where she lives and isn&#39;t quite comfortable with hotels... and at present with some other issues going on... going into the woods might not be the safest issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... we can&#39;t go on vacation now?&quot; Marci asked nervously, &quot;because our flight to Seattle has already been altered...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;it&#39;s just that... well... Teddy might have to undergo his transformation into a were at my own home. Don&#39;t ask, it&#39;s too long a story. When you arrive, just chose the Furline Taxi service. It&#39;s owned in Moon Lake, but has offices in many places in Washington State for travel purposes to Moon Lake for those flying to Washington.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marci only blinked, &quot;Okay... I suppose we could do that. You won&#39;t mind us arriving TONIGHT, will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not, if that&#39;s when your flight&#39;s been moved to,&quot; Samantha answered with a sigh that Marci heard over the phone.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
As the phone call ended, Samantha nodded and hung up her own phone in her office in Moon Lake. She had Teddy&#39;s cellphone number thanks to their private conversation while Teddy was handling personal business in Moon Lake while he was also handling the hunt for Lionel Ulysses. She knew he was leaning toward being a weretiger, but wanted to make sure that Teddy Green was clear with regard to his specific choices.  So, when she made her way into City Hall, she started with the town&#39;s budget office to speak with the only weretigress she felt might be willing to transform Teddy. She&#39;d tried with some phone calls in her spare time, but found that many were hesitant to transform a FBI agent after the arrest and death of Lionel Ulysses. The fear was that it was nothing more than an elaborate sting to lure weres into the open, despite assurances that it wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for being so understanding,&quot; came a feminine voice from beside Samantha.<br />
<br />
She looked over to see the woman, Lila Carpenter in a pair of slacks and a golf/polo shirt with her hair done in a simple ponytail. She&#39;d been willing to transform Teddy Green, and for that Samantha was grateful, as it solved one problem, though her present living arrangements were such that other problems were created. She was staying with her brother and his family, which wouldn&#39;t really allow for Teddy to be transformed there. Samantha and Frances had a spare room they could offer, but it would probably mean that they&#39;d need to keep Ben out so that a new were&#39;s first transformation wasn&#39;t disturbing him and likely Kenya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be too thankful,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;they&#39;ve had their flight out arranged and will be coming out today and will be coming straight to my home for his transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I heard you give your address out... I wondered about that,&quot; Lila answered calmly, &quot;but... if it&#39;s to help a guy be with his wife, I don&#39;t mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;and now back to our own busy days... I&#39;ll see you at around four thirty to get things ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lila nodded and the two parted company. Meanwhile, Samantha watched as Lila left her office and quietly wondered how she would explain this to Frances.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was 5:30 PM when Teddy and Marci were able to board their plane to fly from Washington DC to Seattle. They sat calmly and quietly  with the knowledge that in a few hours... they could truly be together. And since they were flying west, it wouldn&#39;t be that late when they landed.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And that was all that Teddy Green and Lila Carpenter thought over as they went into the guest room at the Twist home later that evening. Teddy of how far he&#39;d come with Marci and how soon, he could finally show her just how much he loved her and Lila of being kind to a man who clearly needed to be with the woman he loved most, but at the moment, couldn&#39;t... but that would soon change.</p>
