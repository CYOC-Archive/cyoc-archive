<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mmm, thanks! I already drank breakfast, but I can totally go for more!&quot; Taylor said, sinking to his knees. Without question, he began sucking off the man who spoke, clearly thirsty for his second load of the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... You&#39;re our neighbors,&quot; I noticed. They too looked much different, but I knew I&#39;d seen them before, although they had more muscles the last time I&#39;d seen them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at the brains on this slut,&quot; the twink joked to his friend while he ran a hand through Taylor&#39;s hair. &quot;Now, come on, my buddy&#39;s waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had this weird feeling in my stomach. It was as if there was something wrong with sucking cock for breakfast. Or any meal, for that matter. I couldn&#39;t figure out what was so odd about it though. It seemed natural.<br />
<br />
I forced my reservations aside as I slid to my knees in front of the other twink. He smiled at me and suddenly I had no qualms about shoving his cock down my throat. I smiled back at him and kissed the tip of his cock before engulfing the entire thing in one go. Mmm, nothing like a nice, warm, thick sausage in the morning.<br />
<br />
It took very little time for me to push the guy over the edge and get my reward. Delicious cum flooded my mouth as I brought him down from his high. Soon after, Taylor and his man moaned loudly as clearly our other neighbor had cum. I felt an odd sense of pride in the fact that I had gotten my man off first. I didn&#39;t know why, but I knew I wanted to feel that pride again.<br />
<br />
Once Taylor had finished sucking his man off, he turned to me and we snowballed for a bit before swallowing down their loads happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for coming!&quot; I giggled with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. Let us know when you want lunch,&quot; the man stated. I nodded and closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? How are we even gonna get food out there? Sure, we&#39;d suck each other off, but then what? I can cum a lot, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be enough,&quot; Taylor pointed out. I looked at the ground. He was right, but I hated that he was. As much as I wanted to get out of here, there was too little we knew about the outside world. We needed more information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine. In that case, we need to do some research on what&#39;s going on outside,&quot; I explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we do that?&quot; Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; I began. There was only one person I knew of that had a device that could connect to the internet. I was fearful of what would happen if we went there, but it didn&#39;t seem like there was another option. &quot;I think we&#39;d have to get Jacob&#39;s phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor&#39;s smiled suddenly grew by a thousand watts. &quot;OMG, yes! Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
He had almost gotten out the door when I&#39;d grabbed his hand. &quot;Wait, we definitely need to shower first. I think we basically had to sweat off our muscles overnight, which means that we stink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor seemed disappointed at first, but then he looked at me like he had a naughty idea. &quot;Okay, but since we&#39;re probably not the only ones who changed overnight, everyone&#39;s gonna need a shower, which means that there probably isn&#39;t going to be a lot of space.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could tell where this was going. &quot;Yes, we can take a shower together,&quot; I conceded. As long as it meant that we could get out of here faster, I was okay with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot; Taylor yelled before grabbing a towel. &quot;BTW, we need to get rid of these clothes. They&#39;re all so boring. We need sexier things.&quot;<br />
<br />
I made a mental note of it and grabbed my towel before we left for the showers. It looked like most people shared our sentiment for clothes, since our towels draped on our shoulders made us almost overdressed for our environment. The most I had seen anybody else wear was a black jockstrap two sizes small. I made another mental note that if I was going to ever wear clothes again, that was the type of clothing I would want. Although, I&#39;d probably go for a more exciting color. Like pink!<br />
<br />
We greeted various people we knew along the way, though most people seemed preoccupied with obtaining breakfast. I was slightly disturbed by the number of people fucking in the halls, but I couldn&#39;t tell why it seemed weird. After all, it was normal for people to have urges and to need to share those urges.<br />
<br />
Taylor had been spot on when he said that a lot of people needed the shower. Almost all the stalls were occupied when we&#39;d arrived. Luckily, the two of us managed to find an empty one at the very end of the line. We figured it was likely because there were clearly at least 5 people in every stall, but I wasn&#39;t complaining. Taylor looked like he wanted to join one of the more lively stalls, but thankfully, he didn&#39;t ask. After all, if he had, I likely would&#39;ve taken it as an order and agreed.<br />
<br />
Instead, I had barely started the shower when Taylor slammed me against a wall and we began furiously making out. Our hands roamed all over each other&#39;s bodies and I was grateful for the various pinches and slaps he gave my ass. By the time I had begun lowering my kisses down his body, I was already feeling quite horned up and ready to blow. I made sure to pay extra attention to his perky nipples -- which tasted even better than they had yesterday -- before once again swallowing his cock whole. Blowing him off was starting to feel natural, but it made sense. After all, who else would I want to fuck more?<br />
<br />
I had clearly been improving my technique, as well, since it wasn&#39;t long before I had gotten my second meal of the day. I quickly stood back up, making out with him a little bit more before Taylor began lowering himself. He got straight to the point, forcing me to play with my own nipples as he swallowed my cock.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t spend much time with it, however, and to my disappointment, it wasn&#39;t long before he popped off my cock. My sadness was short-lived, however, as he spun me around with warning, causing me to almost slip and fall. I would&#39;ve yelled at him for it, but before I could, I was once again shoved against the wall as Taylor spread my ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor what are you-- OHHHH!&quot; I effeminately moaned. Without warning, the redhead began rimming me hard, sending shockwaves of pleasure throughout my body. It felt impossibly amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah Taylor! Eat my boypussy! Don&#39;t stop baby!&quot; I yelled, encouraging him. Soon, however, my shouts turned into garbled nonsense as I got close to the edge. Then, with a long, torturous lick, he sent me flying over the edge, cum spraying all over the shower stall. Taylor desperately tried to salvage what he could, but ultimately far too much went down the drain. I would&#39;ve felt bad, but like when I woke up, I felt that same sizzling in my brain as Taylor rose to his feet, making me slightly woozy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, I wanted that,&quot; Taylor grumbled as he looked at the drain. &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that your boypussy tastes amazing, I&#39;d be seriously pissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry,&quot; I mumbled, still feeling weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; he asked. I honestly wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel weird,&quot; I stated, unsure of what that meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, let&#39;s take you to Jacob. He might know what to do,&quot; Taylor reasoned.<br />
<br />
I nodded, though it felt like there was some issue with that line of logic. We slowly turned off the water and dried each other off. This time, Taylor was the one stopping me from entering the other showers to join the men having fun. For some reason, I kept forgetting that we had just taken a shower, and I wanted to go back. By the time we had gotten out of the bathroom, I was very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Taylor, let&#39;s go take a shower together!&quot; I offered. It seemed like a great idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hon, how many times do I have to tell you? We. Already. Took. A. Shower!&quot; he explained. Oh, did I forget? &quot;Maybe we can go back later, but we need to talk to Jacob now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh right, I remembered now that we agreed to go to him. Why did I forget that?<br />
<br />
We approached the door and Taylor opened it, clearly sure that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem. There, in the center of the room, Jacob had Chase on his hands and knees and he vigorously pumped in and out of Chase&#39;s asshole. Chase, for all his previous grumbling, was moaning away, begging &#39;Jakey&#39; to go deeper, faster, and harder. For what it was worth, Jacob seemed to be complying, giggling away as he did so.<br />
<br />
I noticed that just like us, Jacob and Chase seemed different, too. Both had slimmed down considerably, and although I was still probably the thinnest of the group, neither of them looked like they had touched a gym in years. If that wasn&#39;t enough, Jacob&#39;s hair had lightened to a platinum blonde, and Chase&#39;s hair had become a dirty blonde. And gone was Chase&#39;s Republican dad haircut; his hair was a shaggy mess and it looked like that was never going to change. Last, but definitely not least, the two had massive cakes on their backsides now. In other words, the two were probably even more twinky than us, and I couldn&#39;t help but feel jealous about that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob, we need your help!&quot; Taylor stated, bringing me back to reality. He seemed completely unfazed by the scene in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, it&#39;s Jakey, silly! Jacob was, like, smart and stuff,&quot; Jakey giggled, not stopping his fuck session. I glanced over at his cock and was entranced as it kept disappearing into Chase&#39;s hole. My mouth unconsciously began to water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, &#39;Jakey&#39;, we need your help!&quot; Taylor replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch, you&#39;ll get your turn -- Ohh, fuck, YES -- after me. Harder Jakey!&quot; Chase yelled. &quot;Wait until I&#39;m done with him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have time for that. We need help. Something&#39;s wrong with him,&quot; Taylor explained, motioning to me. Wait, something was wrong with me?<br />
<br />
&quot;I said: You&#39;ll -- FUCK -- get, mmm, your, UNGH, turn!&quot; Chase blurted out, struggling as Jakey slammed into him after every world. &quot;Unless, you two sluts wanna help out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever makes this go quicker,&quot; Taylor said worriedly. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s fuck.&quot;</p>
