<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The nearest fast-food place wasn’t that far from Radley’s house, so the trio didn’t have far to walk.  Radley brought the bottle with him in a backpack, alongside some homework.<br />
<br />
Radly was glad he didn’t have that much longer to be in school.  He felt half-tempted to wish away his homework, or make the concept of needing an education entirely unnecessary, but he couldn’t help worrying that a “lewd twist” on a wish like that could mean something nasty for kids.<br />
<br />
James, meanwhile, was searching the web for custom tailors that could create a few pairs of pants that actually fit his tail, and Haley was thinking of ways that Radely could use his wishes to benefit all of them, if not the whole world.<br />
<br />
The restaurant wasn’t busy when they arrived, so Radley went right up to the counter.  “I’d like the number five combo, with a chocolate shake instead of a drink.”<br />
<br />
“Same,” said Haley.<br />
<br />
The man behind the counter looked like he was barely restraining a sigh, anticipating the backlash from his customers from what he was about to say.  “Sorry, guys, the milkshake machine’s getting maintenance done.  We’ve got soda or juice for your combo.”<br />
<br />
Radley shrugged.  “Soda, then, I guess.”<br />
<br />
Radley felt a shaking from the bottle in his backpack, making a noise like a vibrating cell phone.<br />
<br />
“Uh, hang on, I have to take this.  Haley, would you mind paying?  I’ll pay you back.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, Radley,” Haley said, swishing her tail.<br />
<br />
Radley stepped into the bathroom, and opened the bottle.  Tini materialized in seconds, floating beside him.  <br />
<br />
“Hey there,” she said, waving to him.<br />
<br />
“Hi?”  Radley said.  “Was there something you wanted to tell me?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I just noticed you were offered something you didn’t really want, and thought, ‘hey, maybe I should remind my handsome new master that he has unlimited wishes to use as he pleases.’”<br />
<br />
“I know, but it seems kinda silly to use a wish on something so small…”<br />
<br />
“That’s where the whole ‘unlimited’ part comes in!” Tini said, gently punching his shoulder.  “Nothing too big or small.  Use as many or as little as you like!”<br />
<br />
Radley shrugged.  “I mean, I’m fine with it as it is, but I guess it couldn’t hurt for a small wish…  I wish Haley and I could get some milkshakes, here.”<br />
<br />
“You got it!”  Tini snapped her fingers.  “Now let’s go eat!”  she started floating out of the room.<br />
<br />
“Wait!”  Radley called, grabbing her hand.  “People will see you.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, they’ll see someone who was obviously just another transformation victim, who’s not worth worrying about.  Though I guess I could put on a disguise that screams ‘genie’ less, if you’re worried about someone trying to mug you for my bottle or something.”<br />
<br />
Radley let go of her.  “Oh, yeah, I didn’t think about that.  Uh, I guess how you are now is fine.”<br />
<br />
“Glad you approve.  Now let’s go!”<br />
<br />
They stepped out of the bathroom, and Radley saw the man behind the counter start shivering.  His body expanded, getting taller and wider, his skin turning to brown-painted plastic covering a metal interior.   Despite this, he continued to speak to the next customer in line, with the customer only seeming as surprised by the cashier’s changes as he would be of a sudden sneeze. The cashier’s clothing slowly tore apart while his chest swelled up, resembling a large pair of breasts, with taps in place of nipples.  Her hands and feet turned black, her feet completely shifting into hooves, while her fingers fused, leaving each hand with three thick digits.<br />
<br />
Her head stretched out into a cow’s snout, with a speaker at the back of her mouth.  Her eyes became little cameras, with large, cartoony eyes painted around them.  A pair of grey, plastic horns sprouted up from her head, while a thin tail, ending in a hard plastic “tuft of fur” grew out behind her.<br />
<br />
She finished ringing up the order.  “Your number is thirteen, sir,” she said, handing him his receipt, before letting out an electronic “moo” sound.<br />
<br />
Radley blinked, and rubbed his eyes.  “H-how is that related?”  He whispered.<br />
<br />
“Just sit back and watch.”<br />
<br />
The cow-woman-machine looked up at Radley as the customer took his seat to wait.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re the one who made order twelve.  Your meal is almost done.  I apologize about the lack of milkshakes earlier.  If you want, I can give you some free shakes right now to make up for it.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, sure…”  Radley said.<br />
<br />
The cow woman took out three large cups and placed two of them beneath the taps on her chest.  Then she opened the taps up and, with a loud, moo-like hum, milkshakes poured out, filling the cups to the brim, one chocolate, one vanilla.  When they were full, the third cup was placed under the chocolate tap, beginning the process again.<br />
<br />
Another employee came out from the back, with Radley and Haley’s meals, paying little attention to the milkshake machine as she finished the third cup.<br />
<br />
“Order twelve is ready!  Mooo!”<br />
<br />
She held out the tray for Radley.  Tini grabbed the third shake, and started sipping before Radley could shake off his surprise and take the tray.<br />
<br />
“Uh…  Are you sure this is safe… or well, that he- uh, she, will be okay?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, it meets your governments food safety standards,” Tini said, between sips. “She’s got the labels to prove it.  And trust me when I say that Corporate values her a lot more as an expensive, fancy, AI-Ice Cream machine than they would have as a human.”<br />
<br />
&#39;Well, this is it,&#39; thought Tini. Her first random transformation of a bystander with her new master rather than friend or a relative. A long term transformation for a short time situation. This was the make-it or break-it point. Radley would either want nothing to do with her, or accept she&#39;d done good. <br />
<br />
If he was one of those types who wouldn&#39;t care at all, he&#39;d have already turned every female he knew into his harem and wished for a private island then forgotten the rest of the world. <br />
<br />
While Tini was disappointed by the end of the game with Masters who decided they didn&#39;t want her help, she still felt honor bound to give them a consolation prize of a happy sex life as a going away gift. After all, most humans simply didn&#39;t have the resolve to turn down such chances. <br />
<br />
Radley got that look of uncertainty on his face looking at the cow woman android. Tini knew if you pushed a human too hard they&#39;d always push back. It was always a balancing act to figure out for each Master where the line lay for &#39;encouragement&#39; and what they&#39;d see as &#39;manipulation.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t really what I would happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you think would?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know. I thought the scale of the desire would scale to the change. Maybe I&#39;d have asked first.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, if you told every person you met about me so you could ask permission, sooner or later you&#39;d have wars fought over me: it&#39;s happened before. And you can definite say she&#39;s a lot happier like this, and she&#39;s making others happier too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley looked at the naked robot cow woman, who definitely had more spring in her step (figuratively and otherwise). Her name tag now on her with a magnet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess you&#39;re right about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley took the tray to where Haley and James were waiting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Radley said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like thing turned out okay for us after all,&quot; Haley said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Dotted lines ran horizontally across James&#39; screen. &quot;Hmm. You couldn&#39;t have milkshakes. Then the cashier transforms into a milkshake android ... you said that transformations aren&#39;t really random, but due to your wishes to Tini.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley nodded. &quot;Uh, yeah, I wished we could have milkshakes, and Tini&#39;s lewd twists went from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was better able to help us, so you definitely improved her life,&quot; Haley said, her tails swaying behind her as she dug into her food. <br />
<br />
James&#39; cameras zoomed in on the cow anthro robot, causally helping customers and providing milkshakes for them without missing a beat. It reminded James&#39; of a cartoon of a cat swordsman where the barkeep was a cow who provided milk. <br />
<br />
But more than that, he found himself admiring the calm and order she radiated, a sense of actually having happiness in your place rather than a stress filled ball of trying to win a rigged game. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could help her with the efficiency of this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley cringed, Haley looked at Tini expectant, James braced himself. <br />
<br />
Tini looked at them dimly for a moment. &quot;Huh? Oh! Right! Radley&#39;s my master, not either of you, no offense. It&#39;s his wish that I bring into reality with a pervy twist. Trust me, genies who can interpreted a way anyway they please, and &#39;grant&#39; anyone&#39;s wishes they please... well, they&#39;re more like natural disasters than tricksters. All it takes is one depressed loser wishing everyone had cancer.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone shuddered. <br />
<br />
&quot;So yeah, unless the boss says so, you two don&#39;t get any free wishes. So what you say Master? Do you wish the I answered their wishes too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley looked at his friends. He felt extremely uncomfortable. &quot;Uh, maybe later. I want to still get a feeling for how this works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what you think is best,&quot; Haley nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said James. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry guys, I trust you, I really do, I just don&#39;t think we should move so fast in one day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to fully understand the rules before giving us this power least it have landmines that Tini might be sharing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smart move,&quot; Tini said simply. &quot;I am half-imp after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Radley knew his decision was the most logical choice, but he also didn&#39;t like feeling like he&#39;d shortchanged his friends. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tini, can you grant James&#39; wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that official Master? Not hypothetical?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for you to grant James&#39; wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang... you really do trust me...&quot; Tini said, almost feel humble. She said sadly, &quot;be careful Master, there are people in his world who horrible abuse trust without flinching. As you&#39;ve command, so it shall be.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tini snapped her fingers. James looked himself over, he didn&#39;t any different.<br />
<br />
Tini pointed to a round machine port now in the cashier counter on the customer side, that was waist level. <br />
<br />
James put two and two together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t people find that offensive?&quot; Nudity and such &#39;displays&#39; weren&#39;t the same thing after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you&#39;re a MACHINE, no one is gonna mind. Just plus yourself in, and help things along, you&#39;ll also likely get some pay for briefly donating your processing power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley was honestly a bit curious. Radley looked away awkwardly.<br />
<br />
James stood up and walked to the counter, and pulled down on his speedo&#39;s front, none of the humans so much as glanced at him.  He thought, for a moment, if he really wanted to do this.  If he was ever going to “jack in” to anything he’d hoped it would be a girl that loved him, even if he knew with his… differences, even before he’d changed, that was extremely improbable.  A part of him had been annoyed at the addition Tini had made to his ideal self when granting his first wish, ensuring there was at least one messy instinct still rattling around in his head, and the one he felt least likely to ever fulfill.  He looked down at the plug again.  Well, even if this was less than ideal, maybe he could at least get something out of it.  Did it have to be in public, though?  Even if nobody cared that a machine was doing this, he didn’t like the feeling of beein watched.  But with a sigh, he took his &#39;member&#39; and inserted it into the plug, going in all the way. There was a clicking sound. <br />
<br />
A feeling of serenity and bliss filled James&#39; head, and loins. Beautiful pieces of a clock all performing their function, all needed for the clock to work correctly. <br />
<br />
The cow-anidroid stood at attention in a row, as did the other staff members. <br />
<br />
-Network established.-<br />
-No errors detected.-<br />
-Streamlining cognitive functions.-<br />
-Run executable.-<br />
-Upgrading units-<br />
<br />
More electronic moos came from the kitchen, as one by one, the staff was transformed into busty robotic cow anthros, each equipped for a different role.  One had a hatch that opened up to reveal a dish-washing machine, another had a open grill, another a frier.  Each moved with the perfect mix of friendliness and precision, no movement wasted as they took, prepared, and delivered orders.<br />
<br />
James meanwhile, felt near-orgasmic bliss, mixed with a sense of calm, on top of enjoying the increased efficiency in action.<br />
<br />
Radley blushed as he saw the “improved” staff going back and forth, and James pulled out.<br />
<br />
Tini waited to see how her master would react.  She’d considered making the human staff members more efficient through a neural interface, or something, but worried that something like those kinds of cybernetics that would come off less “sexy” and more “creepy,” compared to being full-on machines.  <br />
<br />
“So…” she asked Radley, as James came back to the table “What do you think?”<br />
<br />
“…I’m not gonna lie, they’re really sexy,” Radley said, “And I’m not even that into robo-furries.  Are they all gonna be okay though?  Is work all they’re gonna have?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, they were still human until a few minutes ago before they just happened to get transformations that fit their jobs perfectly, all their original contract deals still apply.  Hey, if you’re worried about them you can make a wish for them to be flesh and blood again, or wish for them to never have to work a day in their lives, as long as you don’t mind another twist.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll leave them this way, for now, then.”</p>
