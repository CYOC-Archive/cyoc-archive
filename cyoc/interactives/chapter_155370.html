<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle turned to Joseph.  &quot;You even kept quiet when he jumped your leg. Is that what your like? You don&#39;t say anything? You just go along with what someone like Jake says without thinking or acting on it? Stand up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph stood up uneasily.  He had just watched three of his friends get changed beyond recognition.   He didn&#39;t want to do or say or think anything that would piss Kyle off. <br />
<br />
Kyle looked at him scornfully. &quot;You&#39;re on the swim team aren&#39;t you?&quot; he said. Once again Joseph didn&#39;t move to speak or try to say anything.  &quot;Now your in your swim uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph now wore a swim cap, a pair of goggles and a speedo. He stood stock still and silent.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah. Kyle said, &quot;I guess it&#39;s safe to say that watersports are a given. Do you enjoy them?&quot; <br />
<br />
Joseph still didn&#39;t respond when questioned.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You do now.&quot; Kyle said.  He watched as Joseph began to piss.  First just into his speedo and then he directed the stream at his chest and face.   The amount of urine he produced was almost inhuman.  <br />
<br />
Once it finally dissipated, Joseph stood there shaking and shivering in fear.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well shit.&quot; Kyle said.  &quot;If you&#39;re not going to respond to my direct questions, your not going to get a chance to respond.  I&#39;m going to treat you to a whole lot of excitement and you let me know when you&#39;re sick and tired of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is our school the only school who&#39;s swim team wears thongs?&quot; Kyle said. The speedo Joseph was wearing morphed into a thong in the school&#39;s royal blue color.  &quot;How can you swim with you dick constantly erect? Does it act as a rudder?&quot; Joseph&#39;s dick jutted out painfully in the thong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you even on the swim team?&quot; Kyle asked.  <br />
<br />
Joseph pawed at the tight thong and he muttered &quot;yes...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! He can speak!&quot; Kyle said mirthfully. &quot;I thought for a second you were from the same litter as Benson.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joseph glowered at him.  &quot;I am on the swim team.&quot; He finally said with a shred of defiance.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, let&#39;s see those medals you&#39;ve won!&quot; Kyle said.  <br />
<br />
Instantly the four medals that Joseph had won during his high school career were around his neck.  One bronze from when he was a freshman, one silver for crawl from his junior year and two golds for relays this year. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Joey. Don&#39;t be silly.  These aren&#39;t medals you got for swimming.  These are laminated pieces of paper that Mr. Smith made for you.&quot; Kyle said smirking as the medals lost their weight and shine.  One says best housekeeper, another says greatest poolboy. The third says silver medal felcher and the other one just has a pawprint drawn on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What no.  I&#39;m on the swim team.&quot; Joey said with a confused face.  &quot;Joey, how could you be on the swim team.  You&#39;re 21 years old.&quot; Kyle said,  &quot;I guess you got confused because people always say you look sixteen.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joey gasped as he lost hight and muscle mass.  No uh wait I....&quot; he tried to make sense of what he was hearing.   <br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn&#39;t be on the swim team with all of those piercings either.&quot; Joey gasped as his body filled with metal. His nipples were pieces, his nose was pierced.  He could feel a piercing in his tongue. He could also see a large and heavy reverse Prince Albert on his cock.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It would be obscene for you to be on the swim team.  It&#39;s not true.&quot; Kyle said. <br />
<br />
Joey didn&#39;t know what to say.  He began to whimper and cry.  Everything he had worked for was gone.  He was an adult who looked like a child who looked like he had fallen front first in a tackle box.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be upset Joey.&quot; Kyle said with mock sympathy.  &quot;You look great with those piercings.  Look how much you&#39;ve stretched an abused your nipples.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joey cocked his head down and saw that his nipples jutted more than an inch away from his chest.  He touched one and it sent a jolt of excitement to him. <br />
<br />
Joey smiled dully.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;Remember how you used to get treated by people before you met the Smiths? Remember how bad it was.  They put those mean tattoos on you and they hurt you because you were small and a little slow witted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey looked sullen again and said &quot;Yesth&quot; as his tongue piercing  got in the way of his words.  <br />
<br />
The words &quot;Pain Pig&quot; scrawled across his back as well as an arrow pointing to his ass that said enter here.  On his neck was a tattoo pointing to his head that said &quot;Useless.&quot; Along with others that were obscene and cruel and sometimes misspelled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you were so happy to find Mr. Smith and Blake. They don&#39;t pick on you because your a 4&#39;8&quot; twink who loves kink.  They treat you well and let you clean the house and walk the dog and take care of the pool. &quot; Kyle elaborated.  &quot;They sometimes even let you take care of their other needs.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joey smiled thinking about the special tasks he did for Benson, Blake, and Mr. Smith. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on home and take Benson back.  You probably have a bunch of chores waiting for you at the house.  Landry to do, underwear to wash, a pool to clean.&quot; Kyle said sweetly.  <br />
<br />
Joey grabbed Benson&#39;s leash and both of them jingled on out of the classroom.  When Kyle turned to face Jake and Blake, he noticed that Blake had somehow gained a wrestling singlet. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were on the football team.&quot; Kyle said.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I am but if I wear this to wrestling practice, someone is bound to try and pin me or let em pin them.&quot; Blake said with a smile and a wink. Happy to be on to his second porn scenario of the day.  <br />
<br />
Kyle watched as he adjusted the bulge on his crotch to prominently display his semi. <br />
<br />
Mr.  Smith watched him leave. <br />
<br />
Kyle leaned in close to him and said, &quot;I can undo this at anytime or make it worse than you can imagine.  You&#39;re all mine now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then after thinking about it for a little bit, he said, &quot;Don&#39;t you have to go home to set up for tonight? It&#39;s Blake&#39;s eighteenth birthday!&quot;</p>
