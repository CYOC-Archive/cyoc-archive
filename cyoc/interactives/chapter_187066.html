<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl wiggled his toes inside his new socks with a grin. “You are just as comfortable as my Jeff-boxers are, Sam-sock and Dan-sock. Now, adding the finishing touch.” With that, Carl started the same process for them and his old socks as he had before for Jeff, the masturbation sock and his old underwear, the embroidering process.<br />
Sam´s cotton body lifted a bit away from Carl´s skin, only for the needle to start penetrating him. Like Jeff, Sam got his full first name, “Samuel” embroidered with a red thread along the sole of his sock-body. Afterwards, a white thread stitched “Owned by Carl Turner” into the small black ring between the red and blue ones. To Sam it felt like first his back was penetrated, then his forehead, both rather painful, so he screamed.<br />
Dan was in the same predicament as Sam after him. A red thread stitched his full name, “Daniel” on the sole of his sock-body, followed by the white “Owned by Carl Turner” between his colored rings. While Dan was embroidered, Sam could suddenly hear his pained screams, alongside Jeff and the old sock. But while Jeff was shocked into silence by both of his brothers screams he could hear so clearly, and the sock didn´t know what to say, Sam tried to get his brothers attention, calling to him. “Dan, can you hear me? Dan.”<br />
When the pain stopped, as Dan was finished with the embroidering, Sam was still calling for him. But it took another couple of seconds before he answered his brother´s calls: “Sam? How can I hear you?”<br />
“I don´t know. Are you okay? I heard you screaming” Sam asked, his own pain forgotten.<br />
Dan winced, he knew Sam was protective of him, not that he was much better. “I felt like I was repeatedly stabbed by something sharp. Felt like it was first stabbed in my back and then in my forehead.”<br />
Now Sam calmed a bit, knowing that feeling. “So, whatever happened to me, happened to you as well. Only I have no idea what that was.”<br />
“But I didn´t hear you screaming before, Sam” Dan said, sounding confused.<br />
That was when Jeff finally spoke for the first time, still unsure if they would hear him. “He did scream before you, Dan. I´m sorry, all of this is my fault.”<br />
Both twins reacted the same, calling out: Jeff? You can hear us? You need to help us. Carl just ...”<br />
Jeff interrupted them: “I know. And I can´t help you. I´m as trapped as you both are.”<br />
Sam asked angrily: “Why can´t you help us? You just left the house a few minutes ago. Come back and kick that asshole, then change us back.”<br />
But Dan had heard the last sentence of Jeff. “What do you mean, trapped like us?”<br />
Jeff sounded defeated as he answered. “Carl said it, right? He changed me into his boxer-shorts. But instead of changing me back, he made his old, former worn underwear into a replacement of me. And that replacement thinks it is the original Jeff now, that was only pranked by Carl. The Jeff you saw before has no idea that I even exist as a living boxers. And most likely won´t know about you either. That was why Carl sent him shopping coke.”<br />
Now both twins were shocked at Jeff´s fate, it was as bad as theirs. Jeff didn´t mention his extra function, hoping against hope that the twins didn´t have something similar. Finally, Sam muttered: “Sorry Jeff, I didn´t know what that ass did. But won´t your replacement notice if we are missing?”<br />
“It´s okay. How would you be able to know? You just saw “me” before coming over to my room. And I guess Carl will make replacements for you as well, most likely from the socks he had worn before, which you just replaced.” Jeff explained.<br />
While the trio of brothers talked, the needle worked on embroidering the twins’ full names, “Samuel Brown” and “Daniel Brown”, into Carl´s former worn socks with red thread. Just with switched sides. Not that it made a difference for the replacements. But it would for the twins later, Carl made sure of it.<br />
When the connection was made, both twins mentally shuddered. “What was that? What´s that cold feeling?” Dan asked confused. “Oh and Jeff, do you know what that stabbing pain from before was?”<br />
“If Carl did to you what he did to me, he has a needle embroidering your names into your sock-bodies, alongside a notice that you belong to him, something like “Owned by Carl Turner”. And that cold feeling, he has most likely connected you to your replacements, only as there is no human replacement right now, you feel a cold and lifeless object connected to you.” Jeff explained what he knew.<br />
Sam screamed in rage. “He has WHAT? I don´t belong to that ass!” At the same time Dan yelled: “He doesn´t own us, we aren´t his slaves.”<br />
Jeff sighed depressed. “If he keeps us as clothing, we aren´t even slaves, just objects and therefore, possessions. Maybe together we have a chance to get some control back, but I fear we can do nothing without help from the outside.”<br />
Carl grinned as he saw their chat on the computer. He had guessed that now, when there were more humans than Jeff and the human-minded sock able to talk, it could be interesting to read it. He patted his cock through his Jeff-boxers. “He got that right” Carl thought, “they can´t do anything but endure being my clothes, and for now I don´t plan on changing them back, if I ever do.”<br />
Then out loud he said: “I need to get the twins ready, Jeff could be back any minute now.”<br />
Carl had already thrown his old socks on Jeff´s bed. He got up, collected the twins’ clothes from the ground and made a pile just in front of the bed. The only mercy he showed the sockified twins was that they would feel pain when he walked on them.<br />
Now, he could start the changes for his old socks to become the replacements for the twins. Their memory was copied over, but had similar small adjustments like Jeff. They would remember their changes, but not into black tennis socks. Instead, they had become his white socks, nothing special. And of course, they simply shrunk into their clothes like Jeff had before. They wouldn´t remember him asking to suck his toes, and hadn´t done so while changing. No need for the replacements to be angrier at him, even if they were now easier to manipulate by his comments.<br />
Before Carl´s eyes, as well as the view of Jeff and the twins towards the bed, as Carl had put his twin-sock-clad feet up on Jeff´s bed-side table, Carl´s old socks shuddered. The opening on the top got smaller in relation of the whole sock, which in turn slowly grew bigger. The tip split into two endings for each sock, while around the ankle-part two masses of cloth broke away sidewards. Above these outwards extensions, the socks thinned out, forming a narrow, pipe-like connection between the lower part and the rounding upper quarter of the sock.<br />
As a watcher you could recognize a human shape already. The narrowed part resembled a neck, the part above formed a head. The opening by now was rather small, being the new mouth. Other facial features formed just above it, giving the socks noses. Ears and eyes, still in a dirty white color. The lower part of the sock shaped a torso and waist, the extensions becoming arms, with clearly recognizable hands and fingers forming out. The split lower ends formed into legs and feet.<br />
When the growing, human-shaped socks were about half the size of the twins, the cloth started to turn more flesh-colored. On the head was a part turning out more brown, as it separated into hair. Last details like fingernails, the navel or their cock and balls formed shortly before they reached their final size.<br />
With a final shudder running through the former sock’s bodies, the cloth became flesh, completing the replacement twins’ changes. Another second went by before they woke up simultaneous, nearly jumping up from Jeff´s bed. One look at a grinning Carl and a second sidewards towards their gasping twin, before they both looked down themselves, turning beet red.<br />
“Aaahhh... We are naked” they both exclaimed loudly. Then Sam, covering his hanging cock, noticed their clothes on the floor. He was quick to grab both sets, throwing Dan his pile, then quickly starts to put them on alongside his brother.<br />
Carl laughed at their hectic moves, getting an angry response from Dan: “Carl, you asshole. That wasn´t funny.”<br />
“Oh come on you two, watching your horrifies looks as you shrunk into socks was hilarious. And it did no harm to you.” Carl said between laughs.<br />
“It´s quite embarrassing for us, and we aren´t enjoying been stared at while naked, Carl.” Sam said with an angry huff. “That was the same prank as Jeff, right?”<br />
“Yeah, only you were socks and not underwear. No bad feelings, okay? I didn´t dare to put you two onto my feet. I only wanted you to think I could.” Carl explained still smiling at them, wiggling his sock-clad feet for them to see.<br />
“Gross. That would have been disgusting. Sam, I think we go back to our room. Not that Carl gets more ideas to frighten us.” Dan said, and Sam nodded to that. As Carl nodded as well, they felt dismissed, and quickly left the room.</p>
