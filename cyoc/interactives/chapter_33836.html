<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you have the money to get Catherine's ears pierced Karen?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that I only had enough money for food this weekend&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well how are we going to pay to get her ears pierced then?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
Dylan was relieved to hear that they didn't have the money to get his ears pierced. He figured that there would be no going back once his ears were pierced.<br />
<br />
&quot;I called Lisa a little bit ago and told her to meet us at the mall&quot; Karen said. &quot;I haven't told her about Catherine yet. I want to see her face when I tell her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want my ears pierced&quot; Dylan whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be silly squirt&quot; Megan said, &quot;all girls get their ears pierced.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not a girl&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you could have fooled me&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly look like a girl&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not&quot; Dylan whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me something&quot; Karen said. &quot;Do you have a penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you don't have a penis now&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don't thanks to you&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remind me what you do have&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a pussy&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It definitely sounds like you're a girl&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not&quot; Dylan pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Catherine&quot; Karen said, &quot;no one will believe that you were a guy. You're stuck as a girl now so you better get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Karen, there has to be a way to change me back&quot; Dylan pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this joke has gone far enough Karen&quot; Hannah said. &quot;I think that Dylan has learned his lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan is no more&quot; Karen said, &quot;I broke the medallion so Catherine is stuck as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that this isn't a joke anymore?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was never a joke&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we thought that it was&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never told you that it was a joke&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
Megan and Hannah just stared at Karen with shocked looks on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't look at me like that&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just upended your brother's life&quot; Megan said. &quot;How do you expect us to look at you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on&quot; Karen said, &quot;like you two didn't want to see Dylan changed into a girl. We've talked about it enough times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know we've talked about it but I never thought that it would actually happen&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a bit of a shock&quot; Megan said. &quot;It will take a little bit for us to get used to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Dylan asked. &quot;How am I going to get used to this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you'll get used to it&quot; Karen said. &quot;It will just take some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a good thing that it's summer&quot; Megan said. &quot;Dylan should have plenty of time to get used to his new life before school starts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you going to explain this to the school?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll think of something&quot; Karen said. She looks at the clock and said &quot;We need to get going. The bus will be at the bus stop in a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen had to practically drag Dylan out of the house since he did not want to go out in public like this. Unfortunately Karen was bigger than he was now and easily dragged him out. He decided to give up and walk to the bus stop since he knew Karen would get her way.<br />
<br />
When they arrived at the mall Karen led them straight to the jewelry store. As they approached the store Dylan saw another of Karen's friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you could meet us here Lisa&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to come and get a magic book anyways&quot; Lisa said. Lisa caught sight of Dylan and said &quot;Hello Dylan. Were you trying to fool me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen made me this way&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how did she do that?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found a medallion and Karen used it on me&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well welcome to your new life&quot; Lisa said, &quot;you're stuck like this now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping that Dylan would pick up that medallion&quot; Lisa said. &quot;This is payback for him stripping off my bikini last week. Have you given her a new name yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her name is Catherine&quot; Karen said. &quot;You still haven't said how you know that she's stuck like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I was able to sense when you broke the medallion&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Don't worry Catherine, you're not stuck as a six year old girl forever. You will grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get the medallion into the locker room?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you saw me in there&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You see, I used a spell to temporarily change my gender. I don't know how guys can stand being guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it really that rough on you?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It made me sick to be a guy, even for a short while&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I did it though to get the medallion in Catherine's hands.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How could you have known that Catherine would end up like this?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we had talked about changing her often enough&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I knew if you got your hands on it that this would be the end result. When I sensed the medallion's magic working, I mentally suggested that you go into her room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry that I stripped your bikini off of you Lisa&quot; Dylan said. &quot;Could you please change me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do that even if I wanted to&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The medallion was broken and that locked you into being a girl. You should have thought about what could happen if you made me mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I was sorry&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you're sorry now that you're a girl&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You weren't sorry when you were a boy. You were a pig before but now you can grow up differently. So Karen, I'm guessing that you're here to get her ears pierced.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we are but we don't have the money to pierce her ears&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want to borrow the money from me&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You don't need to borrow the money, I'm more than happy to pay for it. In fact, I'll pay for all her jewelry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's awfully generous of you&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's well worth it&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Now let's get your ears pierced Catherine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen, Hannah, Megan, and Lisa ushered Dylan inside the jewelry store. He recognized it as one that had pretty nice jewelry since he was going to get a ring for Cyndi for her birthday next month here. They let him pick out the studs he wanted his ears pierced with. He was surprised that getting his ears pierced didn't hurt as much as he thought, though it still hurt. As a reward for his good behavior getting his ears pierced he was able to pick out quite a few earrings,<br />
necklaces, rings, and bracelets. They went with Lisa to get her magic book and then they all got something to eat in the food court.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did your brother bring you?&quot; Hannah asked Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he did&quot; Lisa said. &quot;He's watching a movie with his girlfriend. If you want, I can see if he'll take you home so you don't have to take the bus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great&quot; Karen said. &quot;Why don't you see if you can stay over at my house. Hannah and Megan stayed last night and they're staying tonight as well. It could be a sleepover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sleepover sounds like fun&quot; Lisa said. &quot;We haven't had one in awhile now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the reason for that&quot; Karen said. &quot;Now that that has been remedied we can have sleepovers again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to shut me up in my room&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're good I won't shut you up in your room&quot; Karen said. &quot;You can even sleep downstairs with us if you want. I'll even let you join in our sleepover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This should be a fun night&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I have something we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it involve magic?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it does&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't wait to see what you have planned&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will turn your head&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I'm really looking forward to it&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll need to get a couple books from home and of course my overnight bag&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should also invite Anna and Rachael&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
Dylan rolled his eyes. 'Great' he thought, 'more of Karen's friends.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't roll your eyes Catherine&quot; Karen said. &quot;They're my friends and it would be rude not to invite them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen, I need to go to the bathroom&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take her since I need to go myself&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Lisa took Dylan's hand and led him to the ladies' restroom. Dylan had often wondered what the ladies' restroom was like. In truth it wasn't any different than the mens' except that it didn't have urinals of course. Lisa went into one stall and Dylan went into the one right next to it. Dylan was a little ashamed that Lisa had to remind him to wipe after he finished peeing. Lisa had to help him wash his hands after since he wasn't quite tall enough to reach his hands under the faucet. He was slowly starting to get used to being a girl. He looked at Lisa and truly felt sorry that he had picked on her. He was a jerk, there was no getting around that truth. Here Lisa was helping him and being kind to him. He now knew that he deserved her anger and what happened to him.<br />
<br />
As they were heading back to the table Dylan said &quot;Lisa, I just want to say that I'm really sorry about picking on you. I was a big jerk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you're sorry about that&quot; Lisa said in a kind voice. &quot;I know that you're sincere in your apology this time. How are your ears feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're sore&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help with that&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I'll teach you a spell to ease pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do magic&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you can&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I could sense that you'd be good at it for a long time. I didn't tell you before because I was afraid what you would do with the knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I probably would have made your life miserable&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might have at that&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I want you to promise that you will be responsible with the magic you might learn tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise that I'll be responsible&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
When they get back to their table they find Lisa's brother and his girlfriend sitting talking to Karen, Megan, and Hannah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bro, could you take Karen home?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure sis&quot; Dan said. &quot;Karen was telling me that she's having a sleepover tonight and that she has invited you. With Mom and Dad out of town I get to decide if you can or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you allow me to attend Karen's sleepover?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I'll allow it&quot; Dan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you bro&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No prob&quot; Dan said, &quot;just make sure that you don't frighten them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Dylan and Lisa had just sat back down to finish eating when Dan asked &quot;Who's this little cutie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my sister Catherine&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did you get a sister?&quot; Dan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesterday&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this Dylan then?&quot; Dan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was Dylan&quot; Karen said, &quot;now she's Catherine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when are you planning on changing back?&quot; Dan asked Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't change back&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Dan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I broke the medallion&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you that it was a bad idea sis&quot; Dan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't a bad idea&quot; Lisa said, &quot;I believe that she's learned her lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Dylan is stuck as a girl now&quot; Dan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he seems to be taking this rather well&quot; Dan said. He then turns to Dylan and said &quot;You may need some consoling to cope with this. I know of a good consoler that specializes in this sort of thing. I'll give you her number so you at least have it in case you want to contact her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Dan&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome&quot; Dan said. &quot;Are you girls ready to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we are&quot; Karen said.</p>
