<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate slowly opened the small cardboard box that moments ago had been handed to him by a FedEx employee. He had anxiously awaited its arrival and now here it was. His very own TransFun serum. He had been looking forward to trying one of these out ever since the company first appeared on the scene and now that he finally had his own place he wasn’t about to wait a minute longer. He pulled back the small piece of foam padding revealing the plastic vial with screw top sitting securely is a specially cut piece of packing foam. He reached in and pulled out the vial. Examining it closely, he made note of the special TransFun seal meaning it was an authentic vial as well as the printed label that read Wolf: Spaced Change. That was important for him. He’d fantasized about this for so long and he wanted to enjoy every stage of the transformation for as long as he could. He had taken a week off work with the expectation it would take a couple days for him to fully transform and then spend 24 hours as a wolf and then transform back. <br />
<br />
He waited until he was about to go to bed to take the serum. He unscrewed the top and stopped. He didn’t really want to transform completely into a wolf, but rather an anthropomorphic wolf-man form was what he wanted. He pulled out a shot glass from the cupboard and carefully poured half the contents of the vial into the shot glass. He screwed the top back on the rest of the vial and placed it securely back in the box. He then picked up the shot glassed, eyed the blue liquid and downed the liquid. It tasted slightly sweet and fruity to him as it went down in one quick gulp. He kept the small glass tipped back until he got every drop out of it that he could. He then set the shot glass down on the counter and walked back to the bedroom, looking over himself. No immediate difference to be seen. He stopped off in the bathroom to look at his reflexion. Clean shaven with short, neatly cut light brown hair. He then settled into bed and quickly drifted off to sleep, yet anxious to see how far his transformation will have progressed when he woke up in the morning.<br />
<br />
The following morning he awoke with a start and surprising clarity. He leapt out of bed where he usually laid in bed for a bit. He needed to check this out. He dashed to the bathroom and flipped on the lights. A scraggly, light beard had grown in overnight, looking like several days growth down his jawline and around the front of his neck. Although for him, several days growth was still a spotty, scraggly grouping, not a thick beard. He turned his head and noticed his ears seemed ever so slightly pointier. He inspected his arms and saw a light coating of hair where his arms hand the back of his hands had been previously bare. His nails likewise seemed a little longer and thicker too. His heart began to race as he realized this was really happening.  <br />
<br />
He flicked off the light and walked into the kitchen, trying to decide what to make for breakfast. He opened the fridge and started poking around, pulling out a carton of eggs and a package of bacon. Nate pulled out the Foreman grill, his preferred device for the cooking of bacon and set it on the counter. He plugged it in and waited for it to begin heating up. He opened the package and the smell of the smoked meat filled his nostrils with its intoxicating scent.  Nate had always been a fan of bacon, as most people these days, but somehow this smelled even better than usual. Nate smiled, figuring his senses were starting to enhance from the serum. He almost wanted to start devouring it right there raw, but thought better of it and proceeded to lay four strips of bacon on the hot grill and then close the lid. He then cracked four eggs into a mixing bowl and whisked them together. He pulled out a frying pan and started preheating it before pouring the eggs into the pan. All of it smelled even more amazing than before as it cooked. As he plated the cooked food and sat down to eat it, each bite tasted exquisite. I could get used to this, he thought. Then a second thought occurred to him. A few moments ago he had wanted to eat the bacon raw, something that had never occurred to him before. As he got more and more wolf-like, was he going to want raw meat to eat? Nate finished eating his breakfast and took his dishes into the kitchen. He went back to the bathroom and checked himself out in the mirror. There hadn’t been much change. He figured he could chance a quick run to the grocery store.  <br />
<br />
Upon arriving at the local grocery store down the street, Nate went straight to the meats department. He looked through the refrigerated case, almost salivating at the products of display. Pork, Beef, Chicken. He picked up a large, marbled rib roast, sniffing it, completely oblivious to the other shoppers and then dropping it into his cart. Same with a couple packages of chicken drumsticks and a couple packages of pork chops. He then wheeled the cart to the front of the store, selecting the self checkout. He scanned each item and then slid his credit card through paying for his purchases. It was only as he was waiting for the transaction to process that he noticed someone else looking at him, a young woman overseeing the self checkout stations.<br />
<br />
“What?” asked Nate.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing,” she replied.<br />
<br />
“No, really, what?” Nate was curious.<br />
<br />
“It’s just I never seen anyone with pointy ears before,” she replied. Nate quickly reached up and discovered his ears had grown and become pointier. He tried not to panic and just smiled at the woman. The machine spit out his receipt and he grabbed it, jamming it in a plastic bag. He dashed to the bathroom, which was thankfully empty and checked himself out in the mirror. He was shocked to see that both his ears came to rounded lupine points and the backs of them were decidedly fuzzy. The scraggly beard he had before was much thicker now and covering his chin and entire neck. He looked at his arms and noticed the hair cover on them had gotten decidedly thicker and if he wasn’t mistaken his nails were a bit longer and thicker as well. He opened his mouth and saw that his canines were noticeably longer and sharper now as well. <br />
<br />
“Great, now what am I going to do?” wondered Nate to himself.</p>
