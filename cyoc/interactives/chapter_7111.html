<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two weeks had passed and Jeff long since put his application for work out of his mind. After a long week of semester finals he came home to find a big envelope slid under the door to his apartment.<br />
<br />
NORTON RESEARCH FOUNDATION<br />
<br />
Congratulations,<br />
<br />
Your Resume' has been accepted as a paid volunteer for testing the<br />
new French Lincare Gene splicing evaluation. If you accept the test<br />
will be for the duration of three months. As in our enclosed agreement the N.R.F.  agrees to pay a sum of $3,600. per month. We<br />
do stipulate that you must complete the total test at which time the check will be given to you personally. <br />
<br />
Please sign the contract as attached and bring it with you to our local office. Please make arrangements to live at the research compound for the balance of the Summer months. All rooming and meals will be supplied as part of the testing.<br />
<br />
The French government thanks you for your interest in science and the Foundation is also pleased to have you aboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW, $10,800. no rent for all Summer, no eats to pay for, clear money, that's just what he wanted!&quot; thought Jeff.<br />
<br />
Telling off the landlady was the first thing he liked the next day. Then a ride across town with a friend who would keep his car for the Summer. Contract signed, luggage in hand he shook Joe's hand and told him he's call when to get picked up in September.<br />
<br />
A fast stroll up the long walk to the front door of the Foundation. The thick glass door swung open as he approached. A gawking look in saw several people sitting as if waiting to be called inside. A report to the main desk proved he was expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a seat and when your #1171 is called you can enter with the reporting nurse.&quot; said the security guard.<br />
<br />
Jeff plopped down and looked at his big stick on number.<br />
<br />
Soon Jeff was getting impatient after sitting for three hours. All the people who were there before him had been called to their appointments and he sat alone looking at the guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Takes quite a long time!&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you here for, someone special?&quot; asked the guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not special, just a paid volunteer for the French Splicing test!&quot; replied Jeff.<br />
<br />
The guard's eye went wide as a somber look came over his face. &quot;You are in that group?&quot; he asked as he picked up the phone and called a number.<br />
<br />
Less than a minute later a woman dressed as a nurse came running down the long marble hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Benson, I'm terribly sorry you sat so long out here, I was expecting you to enter from the personell entrance. Please come time has been wasted the Doctor is ready and we are running now late for the primary testing, come please!&quot; said the nurse.<br />
<br />
A wave from the guard sent Jeff down the hall to begin the testing.<br />
<br />
A turn down a dark lite hall Jeff saw it lined with steel jail like doors with small windows and slide locks. &quot;Keep some test animals in those cells?&quot; asked Jeff sort'a in jesting.<br />
<br />
A scowel from the nurse as she said nothing and scurried along.<br />
<br />
At last they stopped at one of the cells which was opened. Jeff looked inside to see a long bed, a Tv, washstand, toilet, chair and small table. He then turned to look at the nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your cell Mr. Benson! Please enter and the Doctor will be along shortly.&quot; she ordered him in a firm voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I live in here?&quot; asked Jeff as he stepped inside the small room.<br />
<br />
A BANG, and slam bolt went the door which scared Jeff a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Benson I shall explain since it's obvious you did not read the total contract. Upon your accepting the testing contract you were to reprot here and for the first two week reside in a cell alone. As the test begins you will experiance some discomfort. Therefore inside your cell you can yell, spit, and kick all you want without hurting any of the staff. Once the Gene Spliting is done a mutation my begin. If you mutate with personal acceptance you will find us more than greatful, however if you cause discord other things will happen.&quot; stated the nurse nolonger being nice.<br />
<br />
Inside the room was a paper telling Jeff to strip naked and be ready for the test to begin. &quot;You've got to be kidding!&quot; Jeff thought out loud.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the door bolt slid open and a tall thin faced Doctor walked inside the room. As Jeff looked him over the Doctor leaned over to view his subject. A pair of strong security men stood just outside the doorway but seemed very ready to barge in, if needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Benson, you are part of the Gene Splicing test. This experiment lasts for three months. As a test subject you might expect some discomfort for which the final outcome will without a doubt offer full payment. I will take from you a blood sample now and after thirty minutes we should have the first of many injections readied. You are the second part of our testing this wonder drug. A French Scientist invented the formula but nneded the final testing done outside his county. We here and now you will test this serum for potency and watch it's mutations, if any!&quot; explained the Doctor as he drew Jeff's blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Doc, what type of test is this anyway?&quot; asked Jeff as he rubbed his arm.<br />
<br />
The Doctor looked at him, &quot;You are to be tested for memory loss as one of the Gorilla Splicing experiments. In 45 days the basic test will be finished and the memory testing will begin. You with your advanced schooling will be perfect for this test as you have atained greater knowledge than the average person on the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One thousand questions more but first what does a gorilla have to do with splicing genes?&quot; asked Jeff now beginning to wonder.<br />
<br />
The guards walk in as the Doctor motions to them. &quot;Cuff Him!&quot; order's the Doctor. A short struggle ensues but shortly Jeff is clipped and trussed off the floor on a ceiling hook.<br />
<br />
&quot;The term Splicing is a term which does not explain the experiment too well! In fact, you are to be injected with mutatant blood cells which will over 45 days bring about major changes in physical form. As you and I watch your body will change more to look like one of a grown Gorilla. Once the change is complete we will test your learning and memory. If you complete the test and accept the body changes your memory should remain. yet if you fight the change we expect only an ignorant subhuman mind will be inside a grown zoo animal and Gorilla. Either way we have our test done and maybe get to sell a zoo or sideshow a rather smart Gorilla, it would be better to try and help then we will place you in a reformation testing where one might regain some or at least more of his humanity, understand now?&quot; asked the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Just then Alice Roiter walked into the cell with lab testing reports.<br />
&quot;Oh Jeff, you've got to be kidding!&quot;</p>
