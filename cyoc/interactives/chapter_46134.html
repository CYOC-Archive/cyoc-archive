<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two guys are in the back of a costume shop after closed hours.  Looking around for something worth stealing.   When they came across a locked cage.  &quot;Hey Theo look!  There should be something worth stealing in that big thing there.&quot;  Theo look at the cage and said &quot;Cool, nice one Mike.&quot;  Theo and wiped out his lock pick and started to pick the lock.  Mike chucks to himself, &quot;hehehe yeah.  They always kep the good stuff locked up.&quot;  &quot;Aye&quot; said Theo as he just got done picking the lock.  Mike leans his head into the cage and looks around.  &quot;Hey Theo do you see anything worth stealing?&quot;  Theo looks around inside, &quot;Just more costumes... only...&quot;  He reaches in and pulls out what looks like a dino outfit.  &quot;Huh, these are pretty well made...&quot;  Mike looks and sees a nice looking ninja outfit  &quot;Whoa hoa ho, what do we have here?  This is a really great outfit, and it has everything including girls underware.&quot;  Suddenly a cold chill ran down Mike's spine.  &quot;Hey Theo something doesn't feel right...&quot;  *RIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNG!*  At that time the alarm was trip.  Theo looks up at me and yells &quot;OH CRAP!   PEG IT!&quot;  With the costumes still in hand, we bolted out of the back door and gun it down the street.<br />
<br />
Having run all the way back to the hidout, we locked all the doors and closed the curtains.  Mike then turn to Theo and started to laugh.  &quot;HAHAHAHAHAHA PEG IT!&quot;   Looking back at Theo and seeing that he wasn't amused by the remark.  Mike's laughter started to die down, &quot;hehehe.  Sorry about that, I've never thought that having a British friend would be this fun.  Theo then turn and mumbel under his breath, &quot;Har-de-har-har... we were lucky to get away from there...  I heard the friggin' siren behind us.&quot;  Mike walked over to the curtains and looked outside.  &quot;Hey Mike do you see them?&quot;  &quot;No Theo I don't se... Oh what the?&quot;  About that time Mike saw that the cops appeared, but they turn the other way and pulled over a black guy.  &quot;Well I will be darn.  They are racist.&quot;  Theo looks up at Mike and raises his eyebrow.  Mike then turns and smiles and saids &quot;Welcome to America!&quot;  Theo looked comfused and just to end this conversation just shakes his head.<br />
<br />
Mike and Theo walks over to the costumes.  Mike looks over to Theo and saids &quot;Well what did you grab?&quot;  Theo holds his costume up &quot;Huh a lizard... dino maybe... you?&quot;  Mike then looks down in his hands and holds out his outfit.  &quot;Its a awesome ninja outfit, for a girl.&quot;  Theo smirks and mumbels under his breath, &quot;Just right for then...&quot;  Mike then frowns at Theo.  Mike then feels the same strange feeling he felt before, but stronger this time.  &quot;Hey do you feel something weird?&quot;  Theo thinks to himself, &quot;No... I feel ok...&quot;  About that time Theo gets a crazy idea, &quot;Seeing as we got'em... wanna try'em on?&quot;  Mike looks at his friend weirdly, &quot;You don't have a female ninja outf...&quot;  Suddenly Mike had that weird feeling stronger than ever comes over him.  Mike could hear this voice in the back of his head telling him to put it on.  Mike looks back down at the outfite in his hand, &quot;Well... this is a really awesome ninja outfit.  Why not.&quot;  Theo had a big grin going across his face, &quot;Kay... I'll be in the other room...&quot;  Theo walked out of the room and took his costume.  Theo took all of his clothes off and jumped into the costume.  It was nice and soft, but it was a verry loose fit.  Theo started to walk back in to see Mike putting up the last net stocking up his leg.  Mike had put everything on even the girls underware.  Mike says in a girly voice to Theo &quot;Almost done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theo looks oddly at Mike when he got done putting on his costume.  &quot;Are you okay Mike?&quot; said Theo.  Mike then snaped out of it and look at Theo, &quot;Oh my God... Did I just put on girls underware!?&quot;  Theo then try to hold back his laughter inside the costume, &quot;Looking... good...&quot;  Mike then smiles, &quot;You think so?  I think it makes my butt look big... WHAT THE HELL AM I SAYING!!!  Alright we try them on and got our kicks out of them.  Now lets take them off and make sure you don't ruin the costume.&quot;  Theo starts laughing, &quot;Awwww... is the little girly assasin embaresed?&quot;  Mike looks over to his friend, &quot;Yeah whatever.&quot;  Mike trys to take off the skirt, but it won't move.  &quot;Hey, its not coming off.&quot; Mike then starts to yank at it, everytime he yank the tighter it got around his waist.  Theo watches slightly amused, &quot;Are you okay Mike?&quot;  &quot;Dude man its not coming off!&quot; said Mike panicing as he could feel the skirt tighting tighter around his waist.  &quot;Quick go grab the scissors and cut me out of this costume!&quot;  Theo wanders off into the kitchen to go and dig out the scissors.  When Theo just found the scissors Mike started to yell.  &quot;Argh!!!&quot;  Theo then ran into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happen Mike!?&quot; yelled Theo as he look at his friend.  &quot;I can't get it off!  Its getting tighter around my chest too... speaking of my chest its starting to feel... heavy.&quot;  Theo looks back at Mike and thinks to himself.  Mike looks at Theo's face, his friend had this strange look on it.  &quot;Whats the matter?  Whats with that look on your face?&quot;  Theo looks at Mike's chest and stares in aw, &quot;Oh God...&quot;  &quot;What!&quot; said Mike as he felt something starting to pull on his chest.  Looking down thourgh his fish net top blose, he could see his chest expaning.  &quot;W...What!!!&quot;  yelled Mike as he stood there in disbelief.  Theo's got quite and droped the scissors on the floor as he watched Mike's chest expaning out more and more.  Mike then realized that his chest has grown to a C cup and still expanding.  Grabing his chest to try to force the two mounds back, he felt a wonderful sensation.  &quot;Oh wow, that feels good...&quot;  Sqeezing them tighter, he could feel his chest expanding still.  &quot;Whats going on?&quot;  said Mike.  Theo starts to get a nose bleed from watching Mike play around with his new growing breast.  &quot;T...those are... breasts...right?&quot;  Mike looked down and saw that his breast has finally stop growing.  &quot;M...My chest is HUGE!!!  They are a E cup at least!&quot;  Mike then started to feel a tingle coming from his head, as his hair started to grow.  &quot;Whats going on?&quot;  Theo then steps back not knowing what to do but just keeps on watching Mike turning into a girl ninja.  Mikes hair color turn from blond to brown, as it grew it fluffed out.  It grew all the way down to Mike's butt till it finally stop.  Mike then reached back and grabing a little bit of his hair in his hand.  &quot;My hair!?&quot;  Suddenly Mike felt his butt growing more and more pushing the skirt up higher and higher until you saw his underware.  His hips expaned outwards and his waist started to shrink.  Thoe's jaw droped as he saw his friend's body expanding and shrinking.  Mike looks at his butt, &quot;Oh my God!  My butt is as big as basketballs!&quot;  Then finally Mike's legs started to get skinny and rises higher and smoother.  Mike could feel the fish net socking riding up his legs bearly passing his knees.  <br />
<br />
Theo couldn't believe his eyes, his friend Mike just transformed into the most sexy ninja he has ever seen.  Mike blushing because what little manhood he had left disappeared along with the rest of his body.  Theo then takes off the head of his costume to get a better look at Mike.  Mike now talking with a female's voice, &quot;What the hell is going on!?&quot;  Mike was able to take off the costume, but his friend Theo was watching him doing it.  Mike blushed and stop what he was doing and yelled,  &quot;Theo hurry and take off the rest of the costume and help me figure out a way to transform back!&quot;  Theo studders a little bit, &quot;h...how am I suppost to do that?&quot;  Mike in a little bit of a painc, &quot;I don't know Theo just take off the costume and help me figure this out!&quot;  Theo then reaches for the the zipper of the of his costume.  <br />
<br />
Theo then hears a gurgling sound coming from his belly.  Mike then looking around to see where that sound was coming from, &quot;Hey whats that gurgling sound?&quot;  &quot;I think it's my stomach...&quot; said Theo as he started to place his hands on his bloated belly.  &quot;What the...&quot; said Theo as his belly started to expand.  His belly expaned and the zipper pop right off his costume and hit Mike in the face.  Mike screams, &quot;HURRY TAKE IT OFF!!!&quot;  Theo looks down to see where the zipper use to be, but nothing, not even a mark.  Theo then relized that his belly was getting bigger and rounder.  Theo screams in painc to Mike &quot;I...I can't... there's no seam!&quot;  Mike not knowing what to do grabs the belly of the costume.  Mike started to pull at the costume trying to rip it off Theo.   &quot;Lets see if we can rip it off!&quot; Mike yelled.  Mike pulled harder and harder, then he looked up and saw Theo's face in pain.  &quot;Ugh!  Dude... don't!  It hurts!&quot;  Theo could feel his posture starting to change as the costume becoming more real the soft fabric being replaced by tough scales.  Theo could feel his muscles started to growing on his arms and legs.  Mike let go of Theo's belly and watched as his friend's body keep changing.  Mikes mind started to change a little bit, &quot;Oh my, does it hurt?&quot; looking at Theo and seeing his legs started to spread apart.  &quot;N...no but...ugh...&quot;  Theo's arm twisted, and the muscles grew quite big on them, as they shrank slightly.  Sortly after his arms were done his tail started to inflate.  Theo's hips started to get wider and bigger as now he had the hind legs of lizard standing up.  Looking on ward Mike could see that Theo's costume has now became his skin.  Mike walking over to Theo's new body, he started to touch his belly.  &quot;Do you feel that?&quot;  said Mike as he started to hug Theo's big belly.  &quot;Y...yes&quot; said Theo, thinking to himself how his body had transformed into a dino and having the head of a human.<br />
<br />
Mike mind started to fade away when he was hugging Theo's new body.  &quot;Hmmm, you seem nice to hug.&quot; said Mike as he started to squeeze Theo's belly and having Mikes big breast pressing up against his body.  Theo's face started to turn bright red, &quot;Mike what're you doing?&quot;  &quot;I don't know. I just love hugging you, you are so big and squshy.&quot; said Mike as he squeezed him tighter.  Theo feeling weird out by the whole thing, &quot;Yeah well... please don't... it feels... kinda weird...&quot;  Mike couldn't resist it anymore and jumped on his belly and wraping his legs around Theo's chest.  Mike asks, &quot;What do you think of this?&quot; as Mike grab the back of Theo's head and sticking his big breast in Theo's face as he huged him.  Mike then snaped out of it and looking down at Theo's face in between Mike's chest.  &quot;What the!?&quot; Mike yelled as he jumped off of Theo's chest.  &quot;I don't know whats going on with my body and mind.  Whats happening to us?&quot;  said Mike looking in fear at Theo.  &quot;I...I don't know... maybe its these dang costumes...&quot;  before Theo could finish his sentence he started to lose control over his body.  Mike look at Theo as he tried to regain control over his own body.  &quot;Hey Theo whats the matter?&quot;  &quot;I...I don't know...I...I'm not... moving it... help me!&quot;  Theo's body was moving towards the head of the costume that he droped on the floor.  Mike ran over and snach the head before the costume could grab it, &quot;It seems like the costume wants to be finished.  As long as this mask isn't on your body then the transformation won't be complete.&quot;  Theo looking in terror as his body lunges for the mask in Mike's hands.  Mike jumps out of the way of the hands of the costume, but then the tail wraps around Mike's waist and holds on tight.  Mike sticks both arms up in the air with the mask in his hands, &quot;ha you can't get it now with your little arms.&quot; laughed Mike.  Then Theo's body grabs Mike's chest and gives him a titty twister.  &quot;Ouch!!!&quot; screams Mike as he throws the mask in the air.  &quot;Oh no...sorry...I'm not doing this...&quot; said Theo as his body reached for the mask again.  Mike is on the floor rubbing his chest, &quot;Ow ow ow...&quot;  Looking back at Theo as his costume starts to put the mask on his head.  &quot;Oh no&quot; yelled Theo as the mask started to fuse to his face.  Mike jumps on Theo's chest and starts to try to pull the mask off before it gets stuck to his body.  &quot;D...dang it!&quot; yells Mike as he trys to pull the mask off, then suddenly the costume grabs Mike's chest and squeezes his breast.   Mike blushes and lets out a girly scream as he falls to floor.  &quot;W...wa... Thats just playing dirty&quot; said Mike pissed off with Theo.  &quot;I'm so sorry its not me its the costume.&quot; Theo's face started to fill the mask.  His eyes, nose, mouth, and teeth transforming into the dino mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Theo are you alright, do you have control over it?&quot; Mike asks when he slowly walks over to his Theo's body.  Theo starts to move his arms and legs, &quot;Yeah I have control over my body.&quot;  Theo touches his face and realizes that its real.  Suddenly a strange voice echos through out the room.  &quot;You have taken what is not yours!  The sprits insides these costumes have now cursed your!&quot;  yelled the voice.  Mike and Theo looking around the room, &quot;We are sorry, we promise to return them&quot; yelled Theo.   &quot;Please change us back!  I wouldn't last three seconds out there as a big breasted ninja girl!&quot;  yelled Mike.  The voice then yells in anger, &quot;You have taken my most speical costumes where I imprision the most evil sprits!  For that you are now cursed to take the form of the evil sprits.&quot;  Mike and Theo then pleaded with the voice, &quot;Please we have learn our leasons, we will take back what we have stolen.&quot;  The voice laughed, &quot;It is not up to me, I no longer have control over the costumes.  Its is up to the sprits of the costumes to decide what happens...&quot;  The voice fades out in the distance.  Mike and Theo now relized that they will have to learn how to cope with their new bodies.</p>
