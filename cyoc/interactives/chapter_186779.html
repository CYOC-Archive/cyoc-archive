<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Tom woke up, he needed a minute to grasp what had happened. His vision was off, now only seeing yellow and blue. The room he was in looked huge, and when he looked at his arm and saw they were short fluffy and white, he knew the Chronivac had been a success. Still feeling a little groggy, he began trying to stand up, but he found it difficult with his center of balance so different. He had to let a bit of his instincts take over when he started stretching without ever trying. <br />
<br />
Once he was up, he climbed out of the cat bed, and found that he was right next to a window. Wanting to try out his cat body, Tom jumped up to the windowsill to look out at the street below. When he looked through the window, he noticed his own reflection, or rather Bella’s cat’s reflection. She was a small cat, one that he had only heard of but never seen. The features made it clear that she was a white Persian, with her fluffy fur and flattened nose. Tom couldn’t help but feel a little pride at being such a pretty cat.<br />
<br />
Unnoticed by Tom, Bella had snuck up behind him. She reached her hands under his arms and lifted him up. Tom, struck with at least a little surprise, let out a light mew that made Bella chuckle. “Who’s my pretty kitty?” she said in an adoring voice. Tom just stared at her, he was starting to understand why cats always seemed so annoyed. “Oh, how did this get here?” Bella asked. Tom could only assume she was asking him as she knelt down.<br />
<br />
Tom looked where she was reaching, only to find directly in front of the cat-bed that he was just laying on was a white dildo, that had to be at least 10 inches long. He could only wonder how he missed it. Thinking about it for a minute, tom realized that his current body was about that long without the tail. When the realization hit him, Tom wanted to laugh, but found it came out as more of a growl. The Chronivac must have just turned the cat into a dildo without bothering to change its location.<br />
<br />
Bella heard the odd sound coming from her cat and placed Tom back on the windowsill. “Did you put this here?” she asked with a semi-serious glare, to which all Tom could do was meow in reply. She rolled her eye and turned to leave, “How could you even carry this?” she asked as she began walking up stairs.<br />
<br />
Tom decided to follow her if only from afar. Once Bella had entered her room, he climbed the stairs to follow. She sat on her bed and pulled out a bottle from her nightstand. She started squirting its contents all over her newfound toy. She used her hand to spread what Tom could now tell was lube. Deciding that this might be something that interests him, and Bella clearly not caring if he watched, lead Tom to jump onto her dresser to get a better view.<br />
<br />
Bella began her masturbation session, thrusting the full length of the dildo all the way in. Maybe it was because he was now female, or maybe because he had the mind of a cat, but no matter how he looked at her Tom couldn’t feel any form of attraction to Bella. He didn’t even get an erotic vibe.<br />
<br />
Well, this is disappointing… was all Tom could think when he got bored enough to leave Bella’s room. As he proceeded to explore Bella’s apartment, he realized that it looked just like his, two stories and two bedrooms. Bella must be stacked if she can afford a place like this with no roommates. He wandered over to the large window in the living room, where he had been before. Looking around the sides, he found no possible way to force entry. Tom had hopped that Bella would at least have a slightly different apartment from him. At least some secret that he could exploit.<br />
<br />
He went to the front door, examining the locks, he found that it looked fully secure just like his. The only insecure part was the mail hole, but he could hardly think of a way to exploit that. Tom, now believing his plan to be a bust returned to the cat bed where he had started and tried to fall asleep while listening to his current owner jill off upstairs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in Tom’s apartment, the Chronivac was still sitting idle. Tom’s roommate Ethan had just gotten home and was planning to take it easy tonight. He went upstairs to ask Tom if he wanted to play a game, but when he knocked on the door nobody answered. What’s more, the door was cracked. He entered Tom’s room only to find Missy asleep on the desk. On the screen, was a timer counting down with about 10 minutes remaining. Thinking that the timer was some sort of update the Tom was installing, he decided not to mess with it. Instead, he decided to take a look at the little blinking box sitting atop the tower. It looked like some sort of router, but not a kind he had ever seen. He lifted the box, careful not to unplug any of the cables plugged into it. There was some sort of text, written on the label, but it was hard to make out. He spent a while trying to decipher what parts he could make out; nothing made any sense. The only word he could read was CHRONIVAC v4.0 in big letters, but the internet showed no results.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, he gave up. He was leaving Tom’s room when he saw the timer hit 0. Then, in the desk chair, out of thin air appeared none other than Tom. Tom looked dazed and groggy, like he had just been asleep. Tom’s daze was quickly broken when he noticed Ethan staring at him wide-eyed. “What the hell was that?” he asked.</p>
