<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully for Gloria and her friends the rest of their date went smoothly. Splitting up into a girls vs boys team the teens happily competed with one another, even giving pointers to their respective dates as they went. Gloria smiled as she watched Felicia and Adam casually flirt with one another (even suppressing a laugh when Felicia beat Adam in two out of three games.) Adam for his part took the loss well, instead focusing on trying to one up Mike. The two athletes found themselves trying to best one another’s scores throughout the night as their girlfriends cheered them on. As the game finished all three couples were laughing as they approached the car.<br />
<br />
“Wow Your a natural Felicia,” Adam said warmly. “Who knew you could bowl like that.” Felicia blushed as she shyly turned towards Adam. “I just listened to your pointers,” she said. “Follow through and throw straight.” Adam smiled as he now took Felicia’s hand in his. “Guess so, remind me to take my own advise next time.”<br />
<br />
As Samantha and Mike trailed behind they talked quietly of their odd date night. “Well this was definitely different,” Mike laughed as he looked up at his now taller girlfriend. Samantha smiled, gently kissing him on the cheek. “Yes it was and a lot of fun too. I did find it cute how yu tried to use a larger ball at first though.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not my fault I’m too young to use my usual ball,” he blushed. “But at least I was able to recover.” Samantha smiled hugging Mike tightly. “You did great hon thanks for doing this with me.”<br />
<br />
“So did you have fun,” Nate asked Gloria. Gloria smiled, leaning into her date. “You know what I actually did,” she said happily. “This trip to the bowling alley was kind of a great ice breaker and who knew you were that good of a bowler.” Nate smiled sheepishly as he rubbed his neck. “It’s nothing,” he said shyly. “I actually like bowling a lot and it happens to be one of the only sports I can beat Adam at.”<br />
<br />
As Madison Haskins now pulled up Gloria, Samantha and Mike let out a sigh of relief. The 45 year old woman seemed to be her original age still, meaning she was no longer getting any younger or older. “Hi kids,” she called happily. “Did you have fun?” The group responded with an enthusiastic yes as they piled into the car.<br />
<br />
The trip back to Gloria’s home was uneventful as the group now talked happily amongst themselves. As Madison pulled into the driveway the group disembarked. “Okay boys don’t take too long,” she called. “Don’t worry mom we’ll be quick,” Adam replied as he and Nate escorted Gloria and Felicia to the front door. As the trio now stood on the front porch Samantha opened the front door. “Well let you four have a moment,” she smirked. Grabbing Mike she now pulled the boy inside, leaving Felicia, Gloria, Nate and Adam alone.<br />
<br />
The group of teens felt their faces flush as they awkwardly glanced around. They all knew what was coming but none of them had the nerve to actually carry out the idea. “So,” Nate started. “I...um...had a really great time.”<br />
<br />
“Me too,” Gloria replied awkwardly. “We should do this again soon.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” Nate stated, shocked. Gloria giggled as she nodded in response, closing the distance between herself and Nate.<br />
<br />
“You know...um Felicia,” Adam stammered. “I...um...I..uh..I would like it if...um.” The boy trailed off as he felt his fAce begin to burn with embarrassment. Felicia sighed as she approached Adam. As she now gently kissed Adam, she could see Gloria doing the same with Nate. The kiss was quick and innocent but for the two girls it perfected what had truely been a wonderful first date.<br />
<br />
“You’ll call me right,” The girls asked in unison. Adam and Nate nodded quickly as they stumbled back towards the car. Watching them drive away Gloria and Felicia sighed before smiling at one another. “Guess this means we have boyfriends now,” Felicia said. Gloria giggled as she placed her arm around her friend, escorting her into the living room.<br />
<br />
As they entered they could see a teenage Mike and Samantha waiting anxiously for them. “So,” Samantha asked. “You guys dating now?” Gloria and Felicia nodded causing the young brunette teen to leap at them, embracing them in a tight hug. “Congratulations you two,” she said. “And hopefully me and Mike didn’t bother you two too much.”<br />
<br />
“Actually loved having you two with us,” Gloria said kindly. “Hope cousin Sammy and her boyfriend can join us again sometime.” Samantha nodded before turning to Mike, noticing an odd smirk plastered on his face.<br />
<br />
“What are you grinning about,” she asked. “You look like a kid whose about to pull off some epic prank.”<br />
<br />
Mike continued to grin goofily as he approached Samantha. “Sorry,” he grinned. “Was just thinking about something.”<br />
<br />
Samantha gave the teen an odd look as he now approached. Cocking her head she looked unsure of what the teenage version of her boyfriend was up too.<br />
<br />
“Sammy,” he started. “Since I met you you’ve brought nothing but fun and excitement into my life. I love your goofball charm, your sincerity, and your willingness to always help. You...you’ve made me into a better person than I could ever hope to be.”<br />
<br />
“You think I’m a goofball,” Samantha said, placing her hands on her waifish hips. “Look at you your acting really weird right now. What are you up to babe.”<br />
<br />
Mike sighed as he looked at her. He had been planning on doing this soon but after tonight something told him it was the right moment. Slowly lowering himself to one knee the teenage boy now looked up at his teenage girlfriend. Unwrapping a Ring pop he now held it out for her. “Samantha Wheeler will you marry me?”<br />
<br />
Samantha’s jaw dropped as she stared dumbfounded at her boyfriend. She had  this to happen, she just never expected to occur when the two of them were awkward 14 year old teenagers. Smirking she realized that this was probably the most beautiful and appropriate thing that could of ever happened to her.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she squealed.<br />
<br />
Mike smiled, placing the ring pop on his girlfriends finger. Taking a lick she grinned. “Strawberry my favorite,” <br />
<br />
“I’ve um been thinking about this for awhile now,” he said. “I got your folks permission and was just waiting for the right time. This seemed too perfect, although I wish I could afford a better engagement ring.”<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding I love it,” Samantha exclaimed holding it out. “I think it suits us perfectly”<br />
<br />
As the two teens now kissed Felicia and Gloria gaped at what they had just seen. “So um Sammy,” Mike asked. “You think you can grow us back up again. Pretty sure they have laws about 14 year olds getting married.”<br />
<br />
Samantha laughed, touching her necklace. In only moments the two awkward teens returned to their original ages. Mike smiled as he now once again looked down at his athletic, beautiful girlfriend. “Nice to be back to normal,” he smirked. “I don’t know,” Samantha mused. “You were so short and cute plus the squeaky voice.” The couple now laughed before turning towards Felicia and Gloria.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we tell Katie and your moms about the date before we break the news Okay.”<br />
<br />
Felicia and Gloria nodded as they now called to the others, their first date was about to become a celebration.</p>
