<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
I was awoken by ‘Mum’ knocking on the door asking if I was planning on having breakfast. I looked at the phone. It was 8.30 am. I replied that I would be there soon. I climbed out of bed, the key to Jenna’s room was on a thin ribbon. I put that over my head then went to the bathroom locking the bedroom door behind me. I needed to ‘stay’ in the Jenna character. After relieving myself and washing my hands I headed to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Eileen, sorry must think of her as ‘Mum’ was already showered and dressed and I could hear a saw going out in the shed, so assumed ‘Dad’ was already in his workshop. ‘Mum’ said “I want to start cleaning up the kitchen so hurry up and have your breakfast”<br />
I saw a pack of muesli along with a clean bowl and spoon on the bench so guessed ‘Mum’ may have got them out for me. I poured the muesli into the bowl added some milk then sat down at the kitchen table. “Have you heard any more from Sarah?”<br />
<br />
“We gave her a ring at 7. She had not had any further news. She and Hilda were planning to be back at the hospital at 9” I started munching my muesli. “Don’t forget you have to be at Millicent’s at 11.30.  By the sounds of it we wouldn’t be able to see Rod anyway so we may as well carry on as if everything is normal”<br />
<br />
She was referring to my interview for a job as a receptionist at a dental clinic. Getting the job might help keep this body out of jail. Also if I was going to be stuck as Jenna I would prefer to be employed and be financially independent.<br />
<br />
Mum said “I’ve given the silk shirt an iron, I’ll fetch it for you”<br />
<br />
I was still eating but managed to say “Thanks” <br />
<br />
She was back shortly after and hung the shirt on a cupboard knob where I could see it. I finished my muesli and said I would have a shower, as I put my dishes in the dishwasher. ‘Mum’ had already put away the muesli box and milk which I had left on the bench. “I can give you a lift to Millicent’s as I need to go grocery shopping” I knew Jenna did not have her own car. I was getting the impression that ‘Mum’ was reluctant to loan her car. “If you pass out Sarah’s suit I can give it a brush over before you put it on”<br />
<br />
“I can do that myself Mum”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Jenna, I guess I am being a bit bossy. It’s just I’m so anxious that you give the best impression”<br />
<br />
“I actually want the job myself Mum” and I meant it.<br />
<br />
I picked up the shirt and headed back to Jenna’s bedroom. I knew what clothes I was to wear to the interview. But needed to select undies. Also should I put the silk shirt and suit on now or wait until closer to the time of the interview. Also do I put on makeup or not, before or after getting dressed? I wished Sarah was there to advise me. Should I wear any jewellery? Stupid girl I thought, the telephone is right there. I gave Sarah a ring. <br />
<br />
She answered “Hello Jenna”<br />
<br />
“It’s me Sarah”<br />
<br />
“I’m with Hilda we have just arrived at the hospital. I’ll call you back once we know anything” She hung up. Obviously it was not a convenient time for her to talk.<br />
<br />
Oh well I thought I need a shower. I’ll take the phone with me into the bathroom. I decided I would choose some undies and see whether Jenna had some sort of bath robe. <br />
<br />
I opened the wardrobe and Jenna’s undies drawer. I could not see any plain ordinary panties. They were all shiny and lacy in a multitude of colors. I chose a matching bra and panty set that was almost the same color as Sarah’s shirt. I then looked through her hanging space and found a white satin robe that I could put on after the shower. <br />
<br />
Finally I took a Wednesday pill from the contraceptive pack and went into the bathroom, again locking the door behind me. I swallowed the pill with the aid of a glass of water. I was feeling a bit gloomy that in another 2 days a period would start. I realized it was extremely unlikely that I would be able to swap back before then. <br />
<br />
I took off the PJ’s and started the shower. There were bottles of shampoo and conditioner on a shelf in the shower so I decided I would wash my hair. There was also a razor. I inspected my underarms, bikini line and legs, feeling a few whiskers I decided a light shave would do no harm.<br />
<br />
Finally I was finished, turned off the water grabbed a towel from a rack and began drying myself. I noticed I now had a big bruise on my hip, figuring it must have happened when Jenna had thrown me to the ground. <br />
<br />
I put on the bra and panties removing the labels, then put the robe over the top. Out of curiosity I tried to wrap my hair in a towel as I had seen Sarah do on occasions but at that I failed dismally. I began looking through the bathroom cupboards for a hair dryer but could not find one. I tried to remember if I had seen one in the bedroom but did not think so. Where else would they keep a hair dryer? I might have to ask ‘Mum’<br />
<br />
I was about to do so when the phone began to ring. The name on the phone said it was a call from ‘Snotface’ I answered “Hello”<br />
<br />
It was Sarah “I’m finally alone. What’s up?”<br />
<br />
“How’s Jenna?”<br />
<br />
“Not good. We have to wait until the surgeon finishes his rounds to find out whether we can go in and see him. I think you had better start referring to him as Rod and yourself as Jenna. I have no idea where he put the medallion. And even if we had it I can’t see how we could swap you back”<br />
<br />
“Mmm. We need to let Zach know what has happened. It was his body originally. Better that he gets a call from you rather than Jenna. I’m happy to ring the council if you haven’t already”<br />
<br />
“I did this morning just after ringing Marlene. I can take as much time off as needed”<br />
<br />
“I have a few silly questions I need help with. Firstly I can’t find a hair dryer, do you know where Jenna keeps one?”<br />
<br />
“Dad has probably taken it down to the shed. He uses it to dry glue or something like that. Ask Mum and she will lend you hers”<br />
<br />
“Also I have this job interview. Should I dress first then put on makeup or the other way around?”<br />
<br />
“Makeup first. But don’t overdo it”<br />
<br />
“Should I wear any jewellery?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe some earrings. Which depends on how you do your hair. I think you should just brush back your hair in which case just wear some studs. If you are wearing the suit from yesterday I would suggest some gold studs. Choose a couple of pairs and ask Mum which ones would be best. She will be thrilled if you ask her advice”<br />
<br />
“Ok”<br />
<br />
“Don’t wear any other jewellery”<br />
<br />
“One last thing. When is my birthday and how old am I?”<br />
<br />
“Your birthday is April 23rd and you will be 25 this year” That was only 3 weeks away<br />
<br />
“Are there any other special family dates I should know about?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing in the next week. When I have a chance I will make a list. I need to go Hilda is coming”<br />
<br />
“Bye Sarah”<br />
<br />
“Bye Jenna” I will have to get used to being called that I told myself.<br />
<br />
I exited the bathroom and returned the pyjamas to under my pillow than went down to the kitchen to find Mum. “Hi Mum, the hair dryer is gone”<br />
<br />
“Oh your father must have taken it again” Come and I will get mine. I followed her into her bedroom I had never been in this room before. There was an en suite and a large walk in robe. A glimpse in the robe showed me where Sarah and Jenna had inherited their wardrobe needs from.<br />
<br />
Mum, fetched me a dryer from her bathroom and asked “How do you intend to do your hair?”<br />
<br />
“What do you suggest?”<br />
<br />
“I think leave it long, maybe use a clip to hold it back off your face…. Actually I think I have the perfect clip” She went back into the en suite and returned with a small bone hair clip and handed it to me. I had no idea how to use this clip.<br />
<br />
Thinking quickly I said. ”I’ll dry and brush my hair, maybe you could clip it up nicely when I’m finished”<br />
<br />
She beamed with pleasure. ‘Win’ I thought.<br />
<br />
I returned to the other bathroom and did exactly that, drying and brushing my hair. When I was almost finished Mum walked in carrying another hair dryer “Dad apologizes for not returning this yesterday” She placed it on the bench. I unplugged the dryer I had been using.<br />
<br />
“Have you got that clip?” She produced the clip and I stood still watching in the mirror as she used it to pull the hair from the sides of my head that had been obscuring my ears. When she had finished I thought my hair was very business woman like. Neat but simple. <br />
<br />
“Before you go Mum, could I get your advice on earrings and makeup. I really want this job?”<br />
<br />
“It’s taken nearly 25 years but you finally want my advice. Very gladly”. She couldn’t hide the smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“Stay here I told her” I went back to the bedroom, selected a couple of different gold stud style earrings and several different shades of Jenna’s lipstick. I returned to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
“Which of the earrings” She held the in turn to my ear then suggested a pair of about 6mm diameter. <br />
<br />
“These I think”<br />
<br />
“And which of these lipsticks?” She opened them and looked at the colors.<br />
<br />
“All a bit bright in my opinion. You should be understated at a job interview. I’ll get a color of mine I think would be better” She went back to her room, I took the opportunity to put on the selected earrings. She returned not only with a lipstick but with a whole makeup bag. “Are you happy to let me work on you?” she enquired.<br />
<br />
“Yes, thanks Mum. I know I tend to overdo it”<br />
<br />
She worked on me quickly powdering my face, highlighting my eyes and in no-time was applying lipstick to my lips. It looked like the shade I was wearing yesterday. I thought she had done a good job. It looked very natural but all signs of my freckles had been hidden.<br />
“Well go and get dressed now. Do you have a new pack of pantyhose?”<br />
<br />
I thought of the drawer full of new pantyhose in my room. ‘Yep I have pantyhose”<br />
<br />
I returned to Jenna’s room and got out the suit from the wardrobe. I had done a good job hanging it and I didn’t think it needed brushing. I selected a new pack of pantyhose, the same ‘Nude’ color as those I had worn yesterday. I got out of the bathrobe and pulled on the pantyhose. I then put on the silk shirt and pulled up the suit skirt, carefully tucking the shirt in. I had noticed that Jenna had a pair of closed in shoes which were of similar style to Sarah’s that I had worn yesterday but of the same dark grey color as the skirt. I decided to put those on, thinking that they matched well. If Mum objected I could always return to Sarah’s shoes. Lastly I put on the suit coat. I looked in the mirror. My reflection was that of a sophisticated young woman. I was ready to get this job.<br />
<br />
I grabbed Jenna&#39;s handbag and walked down to the kitchen &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look great Jenna. But that bag doesn&#39;t fit the look. I&#39;ll lend you my tote bag. Do you have your resume?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have 2 copies on the desk in the study&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get a portfolio you can place them in. Get the resume&quot;<br />
<br />
She went bag to her own room and came out with her own handbag, a large black bag and a leather portfolio. She took the resume from my hand and placed it in the portfolio which then went into the black bag. She took the handbag off my shoulder and also placed it in what I gathered was the &#39;Tote bag&#39;. She demonstrated  how I should carry the bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to go&quot;</p>
