<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: Sorry, came down with a cold over the weekend.) <br />
<br />
'This is like some twisted and warped layer of Hell.' Gillie thought. 'Everything just blurring <br />
together... I can't even keep track of the days anymore... like a floating sea of events that <br />
just happened to bump into each other... ' <br />
<br />
Gillie knew it was a rather defunct statement, but she really really felt like her sense of <br />
reality was falling apart. 'I just hope I don't end up in the mental ward... I've spend so long <br />
without going crazy... it would suck for this to be the thing that does me in.' <br />
<br />
Gillie managed to get through most of the day before the constant use of the word 'Madam' <br />
began to make her crack. It was when one of her officers brought in a midget who was <br />
apparently a -real- cat burglar (a human sized black cat that went on two legs), that she <br />
finally snapped and headed home. <br />
<br />
Who she found waiting for her at her front door didn't make things easier. <br />
<br />
&quot;GILL? Is that you?&quot; Madam Serenity said looking at the nine foot tall copper furred naked <br />
and BALD lion woman in front of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.... it's me Serenity... and... sigh, it's Gillie now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry... I've been here... I can give you some tips to help with the transition...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm hoping that reality will 'piggy pack' once I try out the whole 'hypnotist' scheme is tried <br />
out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can't believe you Gill! You'd wan to leave me ALL ALONE? Hypnosis, brain surgery, <br />
magic rocks, NONE of those can effect what I remember. On the bright side I means I'll <br />
never suffers from memory loss or senility, but Gill, how could you just abandon me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop whining like we're married.&quot; GIllie said looking down at the small old human. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO! We're not, we never were. But we have been friends longer than most people have <br />
been alive! And you've been the one thing that's helped me endure! I can't go insane, but it <br />
can destroy me! I went from being proud Patrick Aloysius F. X. O'Duffy who could bench <br />
press most of these animal people, to being a petite black woman in an age where people <br />
were still struggling with the idea of Africans people being people! Let alone women! You <br />
should consider yourself LUCKY!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;LUCKY-?!&quot; Gillie roared, literally. Madam Serenity didn't fidget. &quot;That's what you call this <br />
Hell?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lucky! Your family still knows you and loves you and still ACCEPTS YOU. You're still <br />
seen as a person! You still have the respect and authority to do your job! ... And since <br />
reality screwed with your life, that means you don't need to refit your house! And you <br />
didn't lose the strength of the body you had been building carefully and determinedly for <br />
years!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... look, I get that you go through the same a lot, and that you're screwed over, but if I <br />
have a chance to finally end it you want me to let it go for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean -let you- commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie tried to change the course of the discussion, &quot;So you came here just to tell me that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I also came here to talk to you in person on needing to speak with the mayor and <br />
getting access to Glendale's water main so we can use the curse within the water system to <br />
create one big right around Glendale and end in the curse in one fell sweep...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you think that would work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father Mike and Father Paul seem to think so, the ones who created the cure to be used <br />
during the battle with Kurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie wished things could go back to being much more simple. &quot;Fine. I have his number. I <br />
know for a fact for the tourist board will be overjoyed it won't have to spend money on <br />
cover ups and making up lies to keep the tourist from running away from Glendale <br />
screaming...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;GILLIE! WHOSE YOUR HUMAN? IS HE NICE?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Gillie knew that voice, and turned to see Gillian The Second, along with Mother Glen waving <br />
at them, from clear across the street. Gillie was so glade no one else seemed to be out <br />
right now. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity also turned in surprise at the scene. <br />
<br />
&quot;HER name is Madam Serenity, she's a PI who works in regard to the game.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! Sorry! I keep forgetting female human have manes too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hair... it's called hair dear.&quot; Madam Serenity corrected him, &quot;Like some Lupmans have. And <br />
it's humanS when plural.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I apologize,&quot; Gillian II bowed at once, &quot;It's not civilized to use such incorrect terms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity looked at Gillie. <br />
<br />
&quot;My grandparents.&quot; She whispered.<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity only nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not civilized to shout out a discussion across the street and ... did you find a house?&quot; <br />
Gillie had to ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;As a matter of fact we did... this one.&quot; Gillian gestured to the house right across the street <br />
from Gillie.<br />
<br />
Gillie groaned in agony. This was even worse than being turned into a lion woman. Madam <br />
Serenity also patted Gillie as high as her arm could reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this street is mostly owned by the pride anyway.&quot; Gillian II said. <br />
<br />
At the moment a mother and son came home from school, both lion people in a large <br />
van... a father came out to greet them, and in moment had became another leoman with a <br />
mane and a distraction for Gillie between his legs. And the house changed shape to match <br />
the inhabitants. <br />
<br />
'Is this the doom of the human race?' Gillie wondered. Not knowing the divorce rate and <br />
crime rate dropped with every transformation. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Azrael, Thanatos, whatever you wish to call him or what theology you assign him to, he <br />
was Death. And being equal to all things, he accepted the position of judge to the witches. <br />
Perhaps the only one who could be unbias and act as judge to the witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
And as said before, while Marie Cruz felt unsettled by him, she had no idea that the 'final <br />
enemy to be defeated' was to act as judge towards the witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finding someone who'd understand the situation of the witches, and act as an impartial <br />
jury on the other hand... would take some doing. Monica of course wouldn't go to the <br />
natives, after all, they were 'savages.' Though she and Mal'Akh of course wanted a jury fast <br />
and quick so the witches would hang faster... Rosa was about the only one who was <br />
interested in an actually fair jury.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddex asked, &quot;So what are we going to skip next? You completely skipped what Marie did <br />
with the witches they confronted each other for the final time. Which I think was suppose <br />
to be the entire climax of this little story of yours. In particular in the version of reality <br />
without Joella there to take the knife. No offense, but that felt very bad on your part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza shuddered, &quot;Yes... and I apologize for that... but since like I said, I'm the <br />
witches as they saw themselves... speaking about that is liking experiencing it for myself... <br />
and it wasn't pleasant... in particular when the witches saw Marie Cruz with the skull of <br />
their grandmother which threw them into a pure and absolute rage.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
1689 August 10th 7PM <br />
<br />
With Linus and the doctor tending to fallen, Marie waited outside the door for what felt like <br />
hours until she finally knocked on Kathrine's door... 'This feels like the time she spent a <br />
month locked in her room after I punched her...  I was barely able to save my own hide <br />
after that...' <br />
<br />
&quot;Kathrine? Are you okay? You in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am... I just... I couldn't stand those horrible screams anymore...&quot;<br />
<br />
'I've gotten used to them.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie?... Are you really a nun? Or are you an Inquisitor pretending to be one?&quot; <br />
<br />
That was a bolt in the gut. In particular since Marie had been thinking the same thing a <br />
short time before. <br />
<br />
&quot;I.... I don't know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know they're monsters.... but we're supposed to be kind to everyone aren't we? I... I'M A <br />
MURDERER!... I'M A MURDERER!!!!&quot; Kathrine howled. &quot;I am going to Hell!&quot; <br />
<br />
Linus looked at Marie and the door with a completely unreadable face.<br />
<br />
Marie made a decision. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do it.&quot; Marie said lowly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Linus asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gita. Goldwyn. Griselle. .... the witches... I'll defending them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Across time and space. Linus, everyone within ear shot, Kathrine included, and everyone <br />
listening to Marie-Eliza's story including Eliza-Marie, all shouted together, <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza let the echo settle for a time. Then she continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Part of Marie Cruz's defense would later at the trial that if the witch really were insane, <br />
that they could not be therefore held accountable for their actions. And that the actions <br />
they had committed as children, had been done in total ignorance and not maliciousness.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;SHE CHOSE TO BE THE DEFENSE FOR THOSE MONSTERS?/YOU HAVE TO BE MAKING THIS <br />
UP!&quot; Maddex was so besides himself his heads were actually speaking different lines out of <br />
sync, making his two daughters actually yelp in fright of him. <br />
<br />
Linus in 1689 said, &quot;YOU are clearly delusional!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can assure you I am quite sane Linus, and as an Inquisitor I am to observe due process... <br />
and in the name of due process I chose to defend them... they're mad dogs, but they still <br />
deserve a fair trial.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU ARE INSANE YOURSELF! ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was I could just shrug off everything I've done... but I can't, all of my choices have <br />
been my own. I have no excuses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus was seething with rage when he said, &quot;I will remember you said that, remember that I <br />
will.... &quot;<br />
<br />
Betty said sadly, &quot;Linus became the prosecution didn't he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the spot.&quot; Marie-Eliza said simply. &quot;Linus would argue the witches were too dangerous <br />
to allow to live as part of his argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he won of course.&quot; Lawrence said. <br />
<br />
&quot;... You'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the witches were execution so of course he won.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes the witches were executed and that was where they struck the curse on the five <br />
hunters. Weather Linus won during the trial or not however you'll have to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
1689 August 10th 7PM <br />
<br />
Joella listened, half of Free laying on a corner, how the big gargoyle was able to tell she <br />
was still alive was a mystery to Joella, but she didn't want to believe he was lying. <br />
<br />
Joella listened, Grandpa Joseph stayed in the background, doing this or that, anything to <br />
stay out of the way and away from the furry he had seen in three children before, and he <br />
dreaded was going to rise up and devour this child as well, and cursing himself for finding <br />
no solution in all this time to stop history from repeating itself.<br />
<br />
Joella listened, and worried about her mothers, remember how they absolutely hated it <br />
when she called them that, but honestly no other thing she called them felt right. <br />
<br />
Joella listened, and thought about Lark, and thought of Rosa, Samantha, and all the other <br />
children the witches had brought under their wings. Of how beautiful her mothers had <br />
made Glendale, of the protect they had given it. Of the happiness they had handed out to <br />
it's towns people.  Of the evil they had fought in the wandering demons and the paradise <br />
they had been trying to make for everyone to be free and enjoy.<br />
<br />
Joella listened. <br />
<br />
&quot;And your 'mothers' were forcing their will on others, robbing people of their freedom of <br />
will, attacking the very thing they said they wanted to give to everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Free chose to be what she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Others didn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents were angry, and the gang of monsters who wanted to kill me, kill my family, <br />
kill my friends, all because we were related to the witches. I didn't like seeing that <br />
happen... but angry people do harsh and rash things... I hope I wouldn't have done that if I <br />
had been in that place... but I don't want to think of the world without Lark, Rosa, Rouge, <br />
or any o the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grandpa Joseph said, &quot;Lark is the name of the girl upstairs sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vatican thought back to the gang of thugs that Linus had mentioned vanishing when they <br />
chose to go after the witches. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're very well spoken for a human your age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm told I'm very smart for my age.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then you must know what your 'mothers' have done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what my parents have done, they've done because they care about people.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshut.&quot; Maddex's head said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell that to Joella... &quot; Marie-Eliza said matter of fact.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Monica wanted to ask the town people assuming they had gotten their wits back, to be the <br />
ones to pass judgement via jury to the witches. Mal'Akh wanted that as well, the genetic <br />
condition within all Leomans that drove them to be 'civilized' in all things seemed ... off <br />
with her to Rosa's opinion. 'Likely due to Aimiliona... &quot; Sociopathery was an unknown <br />
among the leoman... all the same, Rosa made a point to keep a close eye on Mal'Akh in the <br />
foreseeable future. <br />
<br />
Rosa had pulled ran by age, and Mal'Akh by that logic had to follow along begrudgingly, <br />
and out numbered in this instance, Monica too had to come along with the two naked lion <br />
cubs. <br />
<br />
Monica had no desire to ask the savages for help, after all, they likely approved of what the <br />
witches were doing to try and tear down civilization. It wasn't like they had any civilization <br />
of their own. <br />
<br />
Monia had no way of knowing that the natives would have been almost as eager as the <br />
towns folk to see the witches hung... though given random acts of kindness by one of the <br />
witches earlier that day... it was a mixed bag all the same. <br />
<br />
Rosa led, but of course she had no idea where she was going... where could they hope to <br />
find any impartial jury of large enough numbers who understood magic who'd.... &quot;What is <br />
that?&quot;<br />
<br />
They were at the ring of the boxing trees (They never attacked people as far as they had <br />
seen, not having seen them attack the hunters) and saw the larging gapping hole in their <br />
defenses. <br />
<br />
But what really got their attention, wasn't the burning wood or half smoked deck of cards... <br />
<br />
It was a doll sized naked human female with solid color eyes and insect wings and tiny <br />
feelers growing out of her head... she was... sticking a cross in the ashes?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairy!&quot; Monica screamed in terror and tries to run but accidently trip and fell on her face <br />
instead. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Terror?&quot; Abbey blinked, the blond she wolf pup in her white and blue Alice style dress <br />
asked. &quot;But Fairies are nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is nice nowadays.&quot; Marie-Eliza said, &quot;But faries, like genies, werewolves, <br />
vampires, zombies, kitsune, and countless other creatures of myth had been -tamed- by <br />
modern story telling, becoming only morality tales of not fearing the unknown and not <br />
judging those who are different. ... But faries were originally the ghosts of women who <br />
died before they married. And thus were dangerous to lure men to the world of death... <br />
The Beldam from the book Caroline is actually a more precise depiction of how fairies were <br />
originally shown.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha then said after her twin, &quot;But Pucca and the others were more the modern <br />
version then.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Golgatha's second sight strikes again?&quot; Betty asked feeling tired of that excuse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Rosa asked, &quot;What do you want? What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The little fairy looked up, &quot;My name is Titanna, I, my family, and friends, are here to pay <br />
respects to those who died in the line of duty, knowing no one else shall, and their <br />
saplings will never know them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fairy placed a tiny cross in the pile of ashes. When Monica dared turn around, her eyes <br />
widened at the symbol.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're christian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We acknowledge there is a power greater than our own, yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
The three girls looked at each other, not expecting that answer. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Present Day Present Time <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think we are sis'?&quot; And there was Hope with her biting sarcasm.  The she wolf <br />
with milk chocolate colored fur looked at her sister, &quot;We marched straight into the mouth <br />
of Hell, fought against things born from the nightmares of a lunatic along with mutant <br />
crystal things that were our own pack mates, while you and Jensen, got to enjoy a <br />
foursome as one of you fetishes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee startled and blushed. She hadn't thought about how she, Luna, Sunny, had all <br />
enjoyed Jensen together when they had been that statue Kurse had turned her into, and <br />
then lured Jensen and Luna and Sunny into... effectively giving them Jensen in a round <br />
about way like the two had always wanted to steal her man (or that was how Kaylee always <br />
perceived it).  <br />
<br />
While Kaylee fetish for 'souled art' was well known, she wanted to tell herself that Luna and <br />
Sunny wouldn't make any rash decisions, but at the same time she felt some deep dark <br />
satisfaction that they be no more threat to Jensen's coupling with her. <br />
<br />
Though even thinking of the two was like trying to see a spilled milk during a snow storm. <br />
Kaylee was only about to 'see' it because she knew it was there to begin with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Hope, don't be so hard on her, that witch screwed with her as badly as she did us, she <br />
could barely stand when she got back.&quot; Isabelle said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. I wonder why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee reacted, &quot;HOPE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm joking! Don't take it so personally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course some of the leoman bedded up WOULD ask if they were quadruplets. And Millie, <br />
by virtue of being the only she wolf with her eyes not on the alpha female informed them, <br />
yes, they were quadruplets, but NOT identical, and no, they were not dyed.  Kaylee herself <br />
and her sisters let the questions and comments go, having learned to live with it. <br />
<br />
Then came the next natural unavoiable question of why they were named 'Hope, Grace, <br />
Kaylee, and Isablle.' <br />
<br />
There was still the joke that circulated on occasion that Isabelle should change her name <br />
to Charity, but Isabelle while amused at the idea positively refused. This one the tiny <br />
pebble that would not move, compared to the otherwise laid back attitude of the dark <br />
chocolate she-wolf who was famous for being a follower not a leader. <br />
<br />
Isabelle said, &quot;We're doing fine sis', all things considered. You didn't need to come down <br />
for a visit. You should be resting yourself you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't be much of a sister if I did that.&quot; 'Little' Red Riding Wolf replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and thank you for that.&quot; Said Grace, who wasn't a solid color like her sisters, but <br />
an almost bizarre mixture of white, gray, black, and brown. &quot;It's wonderful to know you <br />
care about us like an Alpha should.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't about me being an alpha. This is about us. I'd do this if I was alpha female or <br />
not.&quot;  <br />
<br />
While it wasn't written down, and certainly in modern times had become less of an issue, it <br />
had been a tradition for centuries that sisters to usually marry the same male. <br />
<br />
For the triplets it had perhaps more to do with their supreme sense of unity that they <br />
cherished and had only been broken once by giving birth to their daughters at not quite <br />
the same tie.  They wasn't to say they didn't each love Jensen, they very each did so. <br />
<br />
That was what made that Kaylee and her own sisters were married to three different <br />
lupmans rather odd according to Mr. P's traditionalism.  Kaylee had earned herself the <br />
position of Alpha Female. While Hope and Grace had fallen for Jensen's best friend and rival <br />
for Alpha hood Zackery. And finally Isabelle carrying little for such things had fallen for the <br />
prince of heart throbs Nick.... Which rather fit her 'let it happen as it happens' attitude <br />
given that Nicole made it very clear who had first call and first pick of Nicolas. <br />
<br />
Some had joked that Alexandra, Nicole's cousin, was an Omega in a Zeta's body, with her <br />
pure and absolute devotion to the pack and to the Alphas, whomever they might be. <br />
<br />
Kaylee carefully hugged each of her sisters, each of whom had found their own place in <br />
life. <br />
<br />
For a human being, such a strung together union would have been maddening, but for the <br />
Lupmans, it simple was. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's so sweet,&quot; Pearl said, &quot;I wish I could hug you right now dear, but I'd scared I'd <br />
opening up the stitches.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zackery just nodded. <br />
<br />
While all of the she-wolves were known to be loyal to their husband, Zack's mates were <br />
known on occasion to be positively fantastic devoted. <br />
<br />
If her sister and the triplets hadn't beaten her to it, most were sure Grace would have <br />
married Jensen, she was so defensive of him sometimes you'd think she was his mate. <br />
<br />
Zackery had apparently caught Grace on the rebound and had never let go. There had been <br />
of course the rumors that had it been a political scheme to get close to Jensen, but nothing <br />
ever proven. And Hope had come to Zack, not the other way around. Maybe she had been <br />
secretly pinning for Jensen too, her entire relationship with Zackery had started with her <br />
making a joke that Zack was jealous of Kaylee having Jensen! <br />
<br />
Some found it a wonder Hope had any friends, but she was honest, caring, truthful, and <br />
perhaps even was what balanced out some of Zackery's other more sublime and unpleasant <br />
traits.<br />
<br />
The way Pearl acted, you'd expect her to be just another dumb blond, she certainly acted <br />
like it. But this was a farce for a keen and almost dangerous intelligence and once a <br />
crushing low self esteem. <br />
<br />
It was shown how dangerous Pearl could be when Pearl had single handedly, on her own, <br />
via the power of petition, nearly gotten Jensen -voted- out of being Alpha Male and Zack <br />
instated in Jensen's place! This had earned her the title of being Zack's 'minion.' <br />
<br />
Jensen however, in the end, brought nothing negative onto Zackery for it. <br />
<br />
After all, Zack had been Jesen's best-friend. That friendship from Jennifer and Zylphia from <br />
the previous timeline hadn't gone away, and perhaps was now more real than it was in the <br />
old timeline rather than Zylphia being mere one of Jennifer's minions. <br />
<br />
Once upon a time the silver and gray June had begun to question Zackery's motives and <br />
attitudes.  When Pearl's attempt to bring the two back together (using the game) had nearly <br />
resulted in the two breaking up, she had drunk herself sick. <br />
<br />
Thankfully for Zelipe, Beatrice was there for her.  And thankfully for Amy, June had <br />
returned to Jensen of her own free will.  <br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The Monkey Prince statue of course now would have four sheaths, on anyone else the <br />
would absurd, even grotesque, but as a god, he carried it well. <br />
<br />
Sunny dreamed of her, Amy, and a felman with Amy's fur pattern, and dragon with Sunny's <br />
fur pattern in scales, all having green tea with the sun. <br />
<br />
Sydney/Uke Mochi watched as the flesh and blood lupmans went about, going this way and <br />
that, moving about, never in one spot for long, hurrying along from one spot to another. <br />
But always moving, always transient, never constant.<br />
<br />
One thought went through Sydney/Uke Mochi's mind, 'Am I really one of them?'  <br />
<br />
'Only if you chose to be.' The Monkey Prince/Kira replied. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The Valkyries, a female dragons only devision of the Army or Air-Force (depending on the <br />
Administration of the term) was forged during world war two... at the time they had been <br />
death in the skies... as airplanes improved in design their presence in the air took on a <br />
more supportive role. And in modern terms were mostly assigned to the middle east where <br />
the terror and chaos of facing -naked-women-soldiers, left Islamic fundamentalists often <br />
at a horrid psychological disadvantage. <br />
<br />
Dragons had never been known for large numbers, but natural selection had bred what <br />
remained of them into terrible killing machines indeed. After three hundred years of <br />
breeding and conditional enhancements, anything short of something that could pierce a <br />
tank was a waste. Making most armor a waste, and only carrying straps for equipment <br />
relying on their third lung for firepower. <br />
<br />
Dragons had stopped going around naked a thousand years ago, but this was in service of <br />
their country, and let it never be said any dragon was ashamed of their bodies even if these <br />
filth were unworthy to gaze upon it. <br />
<br />
They had even picked up a new nickname in the last seven years, 'The bane of Islam.' Of <br />
course for terrorists and insurgents this meant switching to mines, bazookas, and suicide <br />
bombers to deal with them. <br />
<br />
But unlike fantasy settings where the non-humans never adapted to the new styles of the <br />
humans, the Valkyries simply learned to adapt in turn, learning to ambush their opposite <br />
numbers, which in fact -added- to their psychological advantage. <br />
<br />
That was the history document being shown to Trevor's father Jacob Tyson right now on <br />
the news said. <br />
<br />
Trevor's Marie meanwhile asked her son again and again to go over every detail of his <br />
rescue of the pink felman girl from the thug who had used the game on her to apparently <br />
make her sing and dance the songs from a Disney cartoon. <br />
<br />
At least it didn't seem to be anything negative from what she could tell. <br />
<br />
&quot;It seems you've earned a friend.&quot; Marie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl friend!&quot; Nala teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabrina. You know a boy and a girl can be just friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They can?&quot; Nala blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sabrina they can... also... your teacher tells me you're signing your work as 'Nala' <br />
again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Nala!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you're not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't look a thing like her from the cartoon.&quot; Trevor retorted. <br />
<br />
Nala just stared at her mother and made a face at her younger brother.</p>
