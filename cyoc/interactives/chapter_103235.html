<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
What started out as a quiet Sunday morning for the Stovalls would soon turn into a nightmare. <br />
<br />
By the time Alyssa Cooper arrived in Moon Lake, it was just about noon. Having caught the red eye to Seattle last night, she was dropped off in Moon Lake by the taxi service. It had taken some time, as the driver had on idea where Moon Lake was, or that it even existed. She’d already dropped her belongings off at her hotel. Now the only thing on her mind was finding Martin Stovall, and convincing him that he needed a break from his usual “playground”. <br />
<br />
“It’s just as I remember it being.” Alyssa sighed, gazing around. The quiet town hadn’t changed much in the twenty some years since she was last in the area. Some new houses, and some updates to the technology, but otherwise Moon Lake was as it had been in the 90s. Thankfully everyone was wearing better clothing. <br />
<br />
Alyssa walked up and down the streets trying to remember where Martin’s house was. She’d gotten his address via a comprehensive internet search, but she wasn’t familiar with the residential area of town. Last time she was here, she and Martin spent all their time in the lake. <br />
<br />
Trying to follow the scents in the air, Alyssa walked to the lake, and then followed the fishy smells to a lone house with a large pool in the backyard. And a teenage mermaid in it. <br />
<br />
“Must be Martin’s daughter. Or this is someone else’s house.” Alyssa thought. <br />
<br />
The girl swimming in the pool was beautiful, as 99% of weres are. Long golden blonde hair, deep sea blue eyes, and a goldfish-like mermaid tail. Alyssa’s tail was a bit of an anomaly among merfolk. She wasn’t a weredolphin, yet had a very dolphin-like tail in her complete were form. Alyssa was always very proud of that fact, that she wasn’t some run of the mill mermaid with ugly gray or pink scales. <br />
<br />
She tried to keep herself hidden in the woods, but Alyssa still caught the eye of Julie. The first thought that popped into her head was that this was a normal. But the way Alyssa was watching, Julie saw more as mild interest. <br />
<br />
“Hello?” Julie called out to her, loud enough that a normal could hear, but not so loud that she’d hurt the woman’s ears. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt.”  Alyssa kicked herself for getting caught, but stepped out and into the Stovall’s backyard. Julie couldn’t help but admire the woman before her. She was obviously a were. Her breasts filled her blouse, and her tawny hair looked so silky and smooth. <br />
<br />
“Can I help you with something?” Julie asked, swimming to the edge of the pool. Alyssa remained a ways away, just in case this wasn’t the Stovall’s house. It was odd enough she just popped up out of nowhere, and was spying on a teenage girl in a pool. <br />
<br />
“I’m looking for Martin Stovall, and was told his house was in the area…”<br />
<br />
“Why do you need him?” Julie asked quickly. Though she confirmed the woman was indeed a were with a quick sniff of the air, Julie was now worried this was one of her father’s lovers. And that would effectively ruin the little progress her parents made in their relationship. <br />
<br />
“I’m an old friend from about twenty years ago. I used to live in Moon Lake, well sort of. I went to college here. Anyway, I was hoping to catch up with Martin.” Alyssa said. And everything she said was the truth. She had gone to college in Moon Lake, and she did want to catch up with Martin. But more than anything else, she WANTED him, and was determined to GET him. . <br />
<br />
“What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“Alyssa Cooper. And yours?”<br />
<br />
“Julie, I’m his daughter.” Julie said. She was still wary of this woman, but saw no reason to turn her away. Perhaps she was telling the truth. <br />
<br />
“Julie I could use some help in here!” Melissa Stovall called from the kitchen. Julie turned around, and then looked back at Alyssa. <br />
<br />
“I guess you should come in if you want to talk to my dad.” she said. Alyssa nodded, and let Julie exit the pool before walking towards the house. Julie’s tail split, reverting to her stage 2 form, and then back to her normal form. She grabbed her towel, and wrapped it around her waist as she climbed out of the pool. <br />
<br />
The two walked to the backdoor, where Julie told Alyssa to wait while she got her parents. Alyssa took the time to make sure she was presentable. <br />
<br />
“Mom?” <br />
<br />
“In here.” Melissa answered. She was busy going through some of the things they’d set away for the giveaway pile. <br />
<br />
“Do you want these anymore honey?” Melissa asked, holding up a pair of capris. <br />
<br />
“Those? No, I outgrew them a year ago. Listen Mom, where’s Dad?” <br />
<br />
“His office, why?” <br />
<br />
“Uh, there’s a woman out back here to see him.” Julie said sheepishly. That got Melissa’s undivided attention. She set the pants down, and looked her daughter square in the face. <br />
<br />
“Go get your father.” she said calmly. Julie nodded and rushed off to retrieve her dad before her mom got rid of Alyssa the hard way. After taking several deep breaths, Melissa went to the backdoor to find an attractive twenty something woman patiently waiting. <br />
<br />
“Figures, she’s a blonde.” Melissa thought. Martin may be a cheating bastard, but he did have a type. And blondes were something of a weak spot of his. Especially blonde mermaids apparently, Melissa caught the woman’s scent as she opened the door. <br />
<br />
“hello, you must be Melissa Stovall. My name is Alyssa Cooper, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you.” Alyssa said as politely as she could. From Melissa’s stern expression, Alyssa could tell Martin’s wife was the suspicious type. She wasn’t sure what was going through the slightly older woman’s head, but it wasn’t anything good. <br />
<br />
“I wish I could say the same, but I’m afraid I don’t know you.” Melissa said with her arms crossed over her chest. <br />
<br />
“Really? Martin never mentioned me? Shame on him.” <br />
<br />
“How exactly do you know my husband?”<br />
<br />
“I went to the college. I was a corporate law major. Anyway, Martin was just starting out in politics, and I happened to meet him through a mutual friend. And this friend mentioned to Martin that…”<br />
<br />
“Alyssa!?” Martin appeared behind his wife, his face almost white and his eyes as wide as they could be. Julie was watching from the safety of the staircase. <br />
<br />
“Marty!” Alyssa, not caring one bit about Mrs. Stovall, threw herself at Martin. He was glad he caught her before she fell, because that would have no doubt triggered an errection. Martin let go of Alyssa, her beasts suddenly not squished against his chest. He longed to have them pressed against his body again. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing here?” Martin demanded. <br />
<br />
“Duh, visiting.” Alyssa said. Behind her, Melissa was staring at Martin, her eyes ablaze with a mix of emotions. The most prevalent, anger.</p>
