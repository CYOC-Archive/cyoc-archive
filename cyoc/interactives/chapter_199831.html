<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyl-Kyl asked causally as they ignored class for their second round of goblin sex, &quot;Jen-Jen find it weird gobbo have humie taboo &#39;bout parents like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh, we still grow-up round humies, make sense some humie things infect gobbo. More gobbos there are, the more we not have&#39;ta worry &#39;bout what humies think right and wrong. We only second gen gobbos so far!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What if we take further? Get rid of humie taboos infecting gobbos? Now parents gobbos born from humies. Maybe we truth or dare them so their parents gobbos? Then we be third-gen gobbos!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Them smart gobbos now, not dumb humies, we also not make so they know they not always gobbos. Technically they always gobbos, but Kyl-Kyl know what gobbo mean.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If curse gobbo parents, why not gobbo grandparents? Why not make cure gobbo have parents gobbo parents-parents in past, then having parents-parents gobbo parents-parents-parents, in endless cycle until whole family history gobbos?&quot; Kyl-Kyl asks between diving his gobbo-hood deep into Jen-Jen over and over.<br />
<br />
&quot;But then gobbo go on forever! Until first humies, then all world be gobbos. We gobbos have Dyson Sphere by now, if gobbos not blow up world for fun, but then we no have humie test subjects!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl started on that last one. &quot;Yeah, no humie test subjects for gobbos bad. But maybe it not work out that way? Curse only 2 to 4 century old. Should only affect humies until when curse first made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Require experiment to know for sure curse not gobbo homies from before curse so gobbos still have test subjects. This am awkward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen-Jen of this world figure out gobbo in altered-reality because gobbo to human parents, leave notes to me Jen-Jen. Now have gobbo parents. And she figure it out also cause she not part of chain of curses... but now we see curse affect those connected to target too. We not know how far back curse can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Notes from Jen-Jen of this reality? But that Jen-Jen never exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In reality, I Jen-Jen that never exist. We remember Humie life, but humie lives never existed. We no remember gobbo lives, but gobbo lives always existed. Hm. Paradox in curse. When Jen-Jen curse humie Kyle, gobbo forget to include Kyl-Kyl remember being humie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Curse exist outside space-time, otherwise curse cause paradox by wishing things to always be that already were, make no sense to wish that. Kyl-Kyl wish to remember turning Jennifer humie into gobbo. Kyl-Kyl remember you curse Kyl-Kyl to gobbo as thanks. Kyl-Kyl think how it make no sense you wish that if Kyl-Kyl already gobbo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... make sense. So you figure out you before-never-humie. But we not include to remember our each other&#39;s parents before-never-humies... Jen-Jen not remember what before-never-humies parents&#39; look like, only sexy fucktoy gobbo parents. Only remember curse-wish.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyl-Kyl same. Curse-wishes constant even when universe change. Need more experiments.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two goblins also noticed the glassroom had changed slightly. The chalkboard was now a digital white board. At the corner was a circular logo of a naked female goblin grinning proudly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gobbo parents invent stuff too.&quot; Jen-Jen summoned her phone. <br />
<br />
The two goblins looking through the local news, Jen saw her parents, and Kyl&#39;s, had pooled their genius had formed their own tech company, coming up with inventions decades before they were &#39;supposed&#39; to be invented. It legitimately made Jen-Jen giddy. How much further WOULD THEY be able to progress things if they gobbo&#39;ed their grandparents as well? <br />
<br />
Kyl and Jen now second gen gobbos, meaning their parents set standard of what gobbo was, even if it retroactive to justify how humie Kyle describe Jen-Jen first. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen&#39;s family always wealthy, but with more money and power (and Kyl&#39;s family now equals to Jen-Jen&#39;s parents), laws on public nudity and public screwings more lax, city-guard, er, police look other way more for gobbos.  <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen felt a second wave of giddiness, how much more they could twist society norm for gobbos to do as they please if their grandparents were gobbos too? <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyl-Kyl think curse affect the dead retroactively? What if target need to be alive in now to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyl-Kyl not know. Gobbos need more experimenting!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen-Jen nodded eagerly. As much as she loved being a fucktoy for anyone who wanted her, the idea of experimentation and research carried with it a euphoria that was, to the cliche, better than sex!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes yes! Gobbos need way more experimenting with curse!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly hope the curse doesn&#39;t have ANY limits, that would be boring. And trust me, you won&#39;t like me when I&#39;m bored.&quot; <br />
<br />
A stone statue of a nine tailed fox that had been in the corner all this time, watching the goblins screw each other and using the curse became a mass of shadows, it grew and twisted, until it became a impossibly tall woman, using two of the desks (which Jen-Jen noted now had build in screens) as a chair. She was also covered in blood red fur, had the head and paws of a fox, and nine tails that waved and floated behind her like tendrils. <br />
<br />
Kyl and Jen stood in awe at her. Her figure was that of an impossible supermodel digitally touched up in reality, or some sex crazed teenager&#39;s fantasy. <br />
<br />
The naked fox woman crossed her legs, laying her hands on the desks beside her. &quot;Sorry for interrupting the story like this. I&#39;m very entertained right now, and that&#39;s good for you. But there&#39;s nothing more boring in a story than a main character who no limits. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now then: there are only six goblins in existence, the four older ones born from human parents... I&#39;ve seen this pattern before. I&#39;m guessing goblins didn&#39;t exist until today, or rather, they now always existed, or at least did the moment your parents were born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! What foxy mean before &#39;you seen this pattern before?&#39;&quot; Kyl-Kyl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH! Observant! That deserves a reward!&quot; The fox woman clapped. &quot;You two know your families aren&#39;t the only non-humans in Glendale yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Makes little sense they were all natural existences if they all happen to live in town with curse that can change reality,&quot; Jen-Jen nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick on the uptake. This is gonna be fun. Good for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I could ask what your origin story is, but I can guess. Wanting revenge for some high school cruelty, only to forget to immunize yourself to being cursed back yes? I thought so. Pretty standard. <br />
<br />
&quot;But still better than too many greedy idiots I&#39;ve seen try to use the curse to become &#39;immortal all-powerful king of the world, and the curse won&#39;t affect anything ever again&#39;. That&#39;s. So. BORING!&quot; She gritted her fangs leaning forward, her voice briefly taking on am echoing ominous tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry, let me entertain you while I ramble on,&quot; her tails brushed two of the chair-desks, they morphed into comfy leather vibrator chairs with built in vibrator for Jen-Jen. The two chairs moved on their own and came behind the goblin. The two goblins sat down, definitely enjoying the hospitality. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was always the kitsune you see before you, but you know that means nothing in Glendale. Ahem: <br />
<br />
&quot;After my best friend rejected this one jock she was turned into... ugh. You know what? Not gonna describe it, nobody deserves those kinda nightmares. She still had the curse though, and eventually, despite her condition, made clear to me what she wanted. I agreed to use the curse to restore her to normal if she used the curse to turn me into a nine-tailed kitsune like I&#39;d always wanted. I was a total fantasy geek, I wanted live, magic, power, respect, all of it! <br />
<br />
&quot;I honored our agreement of course. One&#39;s word is one&#39;s word. She&#39;s now my majordomo. All my servants understand her will is second only to mine. One of the conditions of my transformation was that the curse wouldn&#39;t further affect me by the way, so don&#39;t get any funny ideas. <br />
<br />
&quot;We also used the curse to turn our old bullies into sapient foxy-women love-dolls. They were eager to be given to various lonely otakus... you&#39;d be surprised how many otakus were more happy to have someone to talk with over using them for their &#39;intended&#39; purpose.&quot; The kitsune shrugged. &quot;But it was fun a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I realized I&#39;d been an idiot. Kitsune grow their tails once every hundred years. And I&#39;d wish to be a nine-tailed fox. My parents were now my adopted parents. Looking through my own things, I found an old parchment: eight hundred years ago I was named Ritsuko Tanaka by my human parents in Japan. <br />
<br />
&quot;I did some detective work and retraced my steps for my eight hundred year life. Turns out I&#39;d been &#39;dying&#39; and living a new human life for centuries, creating new identities for myself. This was now just my latest one. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t able to piece everything together but I was able to figure out how I&#39;d spent 300 years of my life. For 100 years I pretended to be a shrine statue, answering prayers, just as often ignoring them or playing pranks. Then for another 100 I moved to Korea and was as monstrous as I could be... they still make horror movies about me, now passed down as folklore. Then finally for a more recent 100 years, I reversed tactics, and did as many random acts of kindness as I could, with ironic twists of course, I am a trickster, but the twists did, ironically, never subvert what they truly wanted. <br />
<br />
&quot;And at last... I tried out the life I had now, living a kitsune but also as the newborn kit of a pair of silly humans. Today I use the name I Ruth Doe.&quot; <br />
 <br />
Jen-Jen pointed. &quot;Wait! Foxy from Doe family! You live in big house across street from gobbo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically adopted now.&quot; She leaned back on the desk like a couch. &quot;I cried, threw a tantrum, realizing my parents were no longer my parents because of my own short-sightedness. My best friend helped me get over it. I used my magic to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Humans were just my playthings. I had no equal. But not even a hundred years later, I realize I had a problem. I was bored! Bored! Bored! Bored! Bored! <br />
<br />
&quot;I was so powerful I understood that I didn&#39;t even NEED the curse anymore! I could turn this whole school and everyone in it into my personal bathhouse, including you. But... so what? Where was the challenge in my life now? I could make any game as hard or as easy I wanted with a flick of a tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;And In another one-hundred-and-sixty years I&#39;ll change again and become a celestial creature and an equal among the minor kamis. And I&#39;ll lose even more of my limits! I&#39;m thinking moving to one of Jupiter&#39;s moons and creating life from nothing and start a civilization of foxy people from microscopic life and guiding their evolution. But that&#39;s not here nor there.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a flash of blue flame, an iphone appeared in her hands, and she began to play a puzzle game on it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So the point of this long winded exposition, is that the curse is the only entertainment I have anymore. And you two have taken things in a direction I haven&#39;t seen before. I mean, I&#39;ve seen plenty of other creatures created by the curse that human don&#39;t realize were once just from fairy tales, but you two are actually changing society! The one got ambitious but not &#39;rule the world&#39; just wanted their little bubble of paradise. Just ask Greg, heh, excuse me, Drakor. Like the guy who cursed his girlfriend into a genie and moved to a tropical island somewhere and died of old age surrounded by luxury.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just think of me as your audience surrogate. I&#39;m not really interested in helping you, or stopping you, I just want to see where you&#39;re going to take this. Figure out the limits of the curse. Just hope there are limits. Because no limits bore me, and you won&#39;t like me when I&#39;m bored. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I will give you one freebie, it&#39;s the one I give for anyone who shows me something new with the curse: there is more than one chain of the curse. I&#39;ll let you figure out the rest, you&#39;re smart after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
The kitsune turned into a mass of shadows with a wave, brushing her tails against the vibrator chairs that turned back to normal (well, normal for desks now) and slipped under the door. <br />
<br />
Then the shadows slipped back under the door. &quot;OH! A butterfly!&quot; The shadows slipped through the window, and began coyly chasing a butterfly outside the window until both were out of sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;So check, gobbos being watched by effectively all-powerful foxy lady because foxy lady think we fun. Foxy lady have attention span of mayfly.&quot; Said Kyl-Kyl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Check. Also apparently Drakor the big red dragon man who own dragonness-harem-palace downtown once humie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Curse exist for centuries, make sense more than gobbos use to do wild stuff.&quot;</p>
