<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kenny, inebriated and knowing his mental and physical faculties were impeded, he followed the old road, staggering and stumbling as his feet walked the dangerously uneven and rain-water drenched roadway.<br />
<br />
When he could not see the so-called friends that let him step outside into the rain and dark of night, he thought only of seek safety in one of the old barns along the road. In one barn set a demon of doom and delight, his mind reaching past the moot of holy water encircling him and keeping him contained, held hostage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come fool come,&quot; Zepar beckoned the mentality he knew was a foolish human daring the stormy weather to walk the road so few drove or walked, because it was treacherous.<br />
<br />
Ken tried to enter two of the smaller barns but with not luck, they being locked up snugly tight against weather and any vagrant entering.<br />
<br />
The tallest and largest of the barns had at the base of it a door, unlocked, it swinging in the breeze, and offered some dry haven for Ken to gain his senses. Ken staggered to the barn service door but as he entered he felt a dire presence, something what turned his stomach in a knot.<br />
<br />
He entered into the lower level of the great barn, and once inside he saw at the far end the dull glow of a light. The light intrigued Ken, and he walked toward it. Opening a heavy oak Dutch door, the upper half opened and latched that way, Ken entering the next room found there a car museum!<br />
<br />
In the very dim reflected light Ken counted twenty-six very well preserved cars, as even drunk he had an appreciation for the old style workmanship that went into the vehicles.<br />
<br />
As he walked nearer to the light source, there in the shadows came a voice, that of a man, as he warned Ken to venture no further to where he should not go. <br />
<br />
Ken asked the natural question of &quot;Why Not?&quot;<br />
<br />
As then from the next room he heard a deep baritone voice beckon of Ken to come inside and see the best item held there in the museum.<br />
<br />
Ken ignored the man warning him, and feeling his drinks, Ken walked into the lighted room, seeing there the moat and a thing. Ken laughed at what he saw, a strange mockup of a manly torso and the body and legs of a land crab of huge size.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this, some circus side show, and I suppose you would dare me to think this thing is real!&quot; Ken said as he walked close to the moot edge and peered through blurry eyes at Zepar.<br />
<br />
Ken then sat down with his knees and feet dangling over the edge of the moat.     <br />
<br />
&quot;Young fool, your time of reckoning has come!&quot; Zepar said using his booming voice that would scare even the devils that did his servicing.<br />
<br />
Ken sat and looking up at then the alive living, breathing crab-man creature, he was speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not a circus freak, but you, being human could become a priceless freak, the rare delight of a circus owner to own..., ah I read in your mind you bear a wish to be in the circus..., as an animal there, a draft horse stallion, or a cute pony stallion to lure horny women to want as fondle, suckle, and adore you like no women do now, how quaint!&quot; Zepar said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, oh God no,&quot; Ken said as he tried to get to standing up and wishing then to leave that cursed place.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need help rising up to standing, let this poor demon be of some help,&quot; Zepar said as he reached his claw across the moat and touched Ken by the wrist.<br />
<br />
Instantly the touch started what Ken was wishing were his real self and his wrist became the fetlock joint and hand a hoof, as black hide swept to cover his body and pony fur was as a wave ensuing the changed skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I read the future and a certain Connemara pony stallion is due for some wild sexual experiences, and some women who like him, she know their bodies changed to being in part that of a pony mare!&quot; Zepar announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh yes thank you dear devil, I so much wish to be the very horniest of stallion ponies the world has ever seen!&quot; Ken announced, as his words rather surprised Zepar, and tended to please the old fellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shall get all of what you wish and more so if you do as I would direct you, because I want to rake this world with sex perversity and make them burn all burn!&quot; Zepar said.<br />
<br />
Ken, his body was in a mass of changing, his genitals changing to make his new species, delighted Ken the most.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; Ken said his last human utterance as he then began to whinny, snort, and snuffle. His head had changed, and with it his brain size became smaller, but his memories, knowledge of who he was and of what he had become was all there in his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Ken then turned as craned his head to see he was a lovely Dun golden color his self with a black mane and tail. Ken was impressed, and thrilled for finally gaining his greatest fantasy delight, even if it cost him, his immortal soul! <br />
<br />
&quot;Go come the light of day and meet there your friend now waiting at the end of the old road. Return with them lead them here to me and I shall grant you a century of youth and wild sex, the like and kind you never dreamed as possible.&quot; Zepar said as to have Ken lead his friend to some similar doomed their futures.<br />
<br />
Ken happily pranced away from Zepar and past the car museum to the still open service door there as the side of the great barn. The rain by then had ceased and the sweet smell of rain soaked grass urged Ken to try his delight at grazing.<br />
<br />
Ken found grazing as a equine became a fond delight, and the sun was up over the eastern hills when he had the remembered thought to go and meet his drinking buddies.</p>
