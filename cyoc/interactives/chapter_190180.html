<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Smiling down at the new cute young boy, Kathryn said;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then. You&#39;ll find your new seat right over there, MR. Callahan.&quot; Your classmates will be arriving any minute now....&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as she said this, the classroom door opened and a whirlwind of boyish activity flooded the classroom. Still dumbstruck, Trisha continued stand there, looking down at her uniform-clad small frame. <br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest you take your seat, MIKEY.&quot; Kathryn said sternly. &quot;Or else you might just regret it. I always choose at least one boy from every class I take over as my little golden trophy boy. A demonstration should be sufficient to move you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...DAMON!&quot; Kathryn yelled out. <br />
<br />
A random kid, known as the classclown always messing around and getting himself into trouble never able to sit still, looked up the beautiful young lady at the front of the room who yelled I out his name as he was throwing his stuff onto his hook at the rear of the room with the rest of his classmates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; He said. &quot;Do we got a substitute today!?&quot; He asked excitedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I am taking over from Ms. Atwood for the rest of this school year. Would you like to come up to the front of the classroom for a class demonstration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frowning while walking towards her, the boy named Damon said under his breath,&quot; how the heck does she know me already?&quot; <br />
<br />
Trisha meanwhile, was beginning to find her voice as her shock began to wear into fear. Trisha, now little Mike Callahan, looked up at Kathryn and started speaking for the first time in HIS new soft little 10 year old boy voice...<br />
<br />
&quot;How....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on, Mikey. Allow me to show something to you,&quot; interrupted Kathryn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now. Damon,&quot; she continued addressing the other boy. &quot;I have it on report that you are unable to sit still, you act out in class, and make rude jokes. Which, frankly, aren&#39;t all that funny. You&#39;ll learn to sit still. Or stand still, as the case will be, forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathryn pointed at his feet. His black shiny shoes turned a golden yellow. A yellow plinth appeared beneath his feet, like a golden-colored surfboard the same color as his shoes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. Cool! How&#39;d you do that!?&quot; Asked Damon gleefully at the cool magic trick. &quot;Are you some kind of magician, or what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that&quot;..... answered Kathryn, smirking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now class,&quot; she said in a louder, more commanding voice. &quot;I want you all to come up here and join your new classmate, whom I will introduce to you shortly, for a small demonstration of what disobeying your new teacher will mean for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As for you,&quot; she said, addressing Trisha, &quot;this goes for you also. You&#39;ve already received one demonstration of my powers. You&#39;ll now get to witness another. I suggest you take it seriously to heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys all shuffled forward towards the front of the classroom where the three individuals were already standing. They formed a semi-circle, so each could see the neat trick. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the golden hue climbed up over Damon&#39;s ankles, locking them in place. His gleefull smile began to turn into a frown, as he realized his feet were stuck to his new platform. <br />
<br />
Kathryn produced a small little trophy and presented it to the class. It was of a young boy sitting Indian-style on a golden plinth, looking up with expressive motionless eyes. All too expressive. Both sad and fearful. His plinth was attached to a small stand with a plaque on the bottom which read his name, as well as the year 1986.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my oldest trophy boy. He&#39;s been stuck like this for about 35 years. He was my ex-husband who cheated on me. Well, technically, the boy is our 12 year old son.  I switched their bodies, and turned my husdand-turned-son into this here trophy you now see. In case you&#39;re wondering, yes. He&#39;s still very much alive and very much aware in there. And yes, he&#39;s been stuck like that for 35 years, and will be forevermore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I choose at least one boy to join my collection every year,&quot; she continued. A large trophy case appeared of similar trophies, all boys. All on the exact same plinths which were all mounted to exactly the same stands. Each stand with each individuals&#39; names on them as well as the year of their transformations into little golden statues. Sone years with multiple statues. 42 in all. Each statue with vastly different expressions on their faces, and each of their body postures slightly different. Some were smiling. Some were defiant. Some angry. Most were scares. Each with their own individual stories that only Kathryn knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Damon, my dear boy, you&#39;re the lucky one that&#39;s been chosen to join your new....pals,&quot; she said, indicicating an open spot in her trophy case just for him. <br />
<br />
Slowly realizing this was no game, Damon found his knees were now locked in place. The hard golden substance had transformed him up to his mid-thighs.<br />
<br />
Being an early developer, Damon found his penis inside his pants straighten out and harden. He was developing his very fist hard-on! His penis slowly tented his pants. He felt like he needed to pee, but it was somehow....different! His blood rushed to his dick as it continue growing inside his pants. He felt as if he was almost on fire. <br />
<br />
Damon was now scared for two reasons:<br />
<br />
He was turning into a statue that would soon be shrinkified and sitting on a shelf in a glass trophy case forever, and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with his penis inside his own pants. This was all taking place right in front of his classmates! For the first time in his, he didn&#39;t have anything to say. <br />
<br />
The golden color extended up to his hips, locking them in place forever. He felt his penis harden a second time. This time, on a more permanant basis. He instinctively reached down to &quot;feel himself&quot; through his pants as he gripped himself. But all that he felt, was the cold hardness of his pants with a slight lump beneath them. His clothes were changing to gold as his body beneath them were. <br />
<br />
As soon as he gripped the bulge where his penis should be beneath what should have even fabric, his left hand became attached to it in a tight grip. His fingers joined the statue as they hardened into position. <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Damon squeaked out, as he brought his other hand to try and pry his left hand free. All he managed to do, was have his right hand join his left, gripping it and hardening into position. Now he was going to be forever stuck &quot;holding himself,&quot; to the amusement of all who would lay eyes on him. <br />
<br />
Legs, knees, hips, and hands all now permanently locked into place, Damon was now stuck in the pose he would keep forever. The gold continued rising inexorably up towards his belly and his elbows. All he could do now, was swivel his head around. He was completely vulnerable to one of his classmates who decided to start pegging him in the head with small objects. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please...OW! Stop that!....please, don&#39;t do this to me,&quot; he begged as something clipped his nose. He looked around, and saw another object come right for his eye. He tried blocking it with his hand, but it would not respond. It was stuck still holding himself. A rubber eraser hit him to the left of his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; he tried to huff. But his lungs inside his chest had frozen into place as his chest cavity solidified. He could no longer breathe, and therefore, would no longer make a sound. All he could do now, is mouth his words. <br />
<br />
Higher and higher, the gold climbed. Up towards his shoulders and neck. He made one last head movement before his head locked into place. He was now stuck looking slightly upward and slightly to the right, right at Kathryn. His mouth was working like a fish out of water, as his eyes were in full-on begging mode. <br />
 <br />
Kathryn produced a full body mirror on the backside of the door, and turned poor Damon towards it, so he could see his own progress. She stood behind him, and a bit to his right so he could see her wicked smile as well. <br />
<br />
Damon was terrified to see himself mostly as a golden statue. Unable to ever move again. His jaw dropped as his eyes widened. There was nothing he could do. He was completely helpless and at the mercy of the magic. The golden color reached his jawline, and his mouth was now left hanging open in a look of disbelief while he was holding himself. He looked ridiculous, like he was caught &quot;being naughty.&quot; And he would look like this forever!<br />
<br />
His cheeks solidified, as it rose up towards his eyeballs. He gave one final look directly at himself, before the color slowly faded towards gold. He would be screaming if he could, as his eyeballs joined the rest of his body and locked into place in a puppy dog begging sort of manner. <br />
<br />
The golden color continued traveling up his forehead and over his short, spikey hair. Damon was now nothing more than a golden statue with a terrified conscience. <br />
<br />
He began to shrink. From his perspective, he saw the door in front of him, as well as the class reflected from the mirror, begin to grow larger. Larger, and larger, everything grew. Damon saw himself, as a statue, grow smaller in the reflection. At the same time, the plinth his feet were stuck to began rising from the ground. His new trophy stand was growing beneath him. Exactly the same thing as the other trophy boys in the cabinet!<br />
<br />
Damon tried to yell out his protests, but being stuck as an immobile object made it impossible. Trophies were only meant to be looked at. His new trophy stand he was stuck with was finished growing. Finally, a golden-colored metal name plate appeared on his base with is name, and the year 2021.</p>
