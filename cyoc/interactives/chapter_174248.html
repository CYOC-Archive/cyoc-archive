<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There are two pairs of dads and sons: Eddie, age 10 and his father Sully, age 49 as well as Lewis, age 7 and his father Russell, age 35<br />
<br />
They have swapped in a crisscross fashion, fathers and sons swapping with each other, just not their own parents/children. <br />
<br />
Eddie, age ten, is now Big Ed. Eddie swapped bodies with Russell Boswell, a biker with long curly dirty blond hair tied up in a ponytail<br />
<br />
Russell Fletcher is now Little Russ or &quot;Rusty&quot;. He swapped bodies with Eddie. <br />
<br />
Eddie&#39;s father, Sully, is now Little Sully, age 7. He swapped bodies with Lewis<br />
<br />
Lewis, age 7, is now Big Lewis, aka Big Lou, resembling an older and very handsome (and taller version) of Luke Perry with hair like an older Brad Pitt, with a craggy face and beautiful eyes. He swapped bodies with Sully.<br />
<br />
In their cabin, Big Ed and Little Sully are exploring their new big and little bodies. <br />
<br />
&quot;My face has fur on it. This is so cool!&quot; Big Ed replied. His nametag read Big Ed on it. It already came with BIG already written on it. Meanwhile, his father had a nametag sticker that said LITTLE Sully. They were both getting used to being both a different age and having a different hair color, in their case a dirty, shaggy blond. Big Ed couldn&#39;t believe how...dangerous looking he was now. He looked in the mirror in his cabin in absolute wonder, cocking his head from side to side. His face was covered in a shade between blonde and brown, a tawny deep gold. Likewise, his long, tangled hair, windswept and tied up in a pony tail, hung past his shoulders. His body felt so different, so much stronger. Tattoos piled over muscles that were absolutely jacked to the max! He looked so buff and intimidating, with a wide chest that gleaned with ink over a perfect mesomorphed frame. He was tall! A whole 6 foot 1 inches! He had a deep voice and the pocket in his new jacket even came with a cigar! Mr. Boswell had told him that since he&#39;d taken his car rather than his Harley, he&#39;d been able to bring more than enough cigars to last him the entire summer! <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to tell my friends back home that I got to be inside a guy with this much muscle! They&#39;re gonna be so jealous! Not to mention the fact that I get to smoke and drink. This is gonna be the coolest summer ever!&quot; Big Ed shook his head enthusiastically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember you&#39;re going to have to get adult responsibilities as well,&quot; his now pint sized father told him. <br />
&quot;Oh, for sure. I&#39;m totally adult enough for that. I will take good care of you, Dad! I mean, s..uh...Son. Son. This is so confusing.&quot; Big Ed furrowed his eyebrows. <br />
<br />
Little Sully looked up at his new Daddy for the time being. He had been having second thoughts but seeing how happy this had made his son made it all worthwhile. The confidence boost would do him so much good, he thought. It would make his son want to be a true leader among men, someone who was capable of handling any problem. That was the real goal. To give his son a competitive edge in the world. <br />
<br />
What his son didn&#39;t even know was that these days, most colleges were hoping for boys to have had adult experiences. Most jobs, too. A lot of people, mainly men, were getting really good job experiences by going for temporary swaps that would allow them to enter the workforce at age 10 up. These swaps allowed them to master skills that would have taken them much longer to learn since they were adapting to new brains that had the knowledge stored in them. That varied, though. Some swappees experienced exponential increase in ability once they swapped, and even retained their new skills upon being swapped back, though some spent more time getting good work experience than others...<br />
<br />
Having this camp on a resume would be a really good move. It was becoming one of the most elite swap camps in the country, with alumni often getting into prestigious colleges and military academies. If he played his cards right, he could really make sure his son got onto a path where he could make a far better living than his father. And Little Sully now wanted that more than anything. For that, he was willing to sacrifice and be Little Sully, to be just a boy in the world who had to look up to grown ups to tell him what to do. To give over control. It was a lot for him to do, but he needed to do it.<br />
<br />
The only reason he could afford the time for the swap was because he had been let go from his job. Robotics took over the car industry and he had actually been in management over an entire team of people. When he got fired, they gave him a few options. They would give him an ample enough severance pay to last him for three whole months in exchange for signing a non disclosure agreement and not ever saying bad things about the company in public. He was to keep his disgruntled thoughts about being fired to himself. But they would give him enough to last him a year, a whole YEAR&#39;S worth of pay if he went to one of those father son body swap camps! <br />
<br />
The entire thing made him a little uneasy but they convinced him all it was for a good cause. The owner of the company owned several other companies as well, and he was well invested in body swap camps. The owner wanted to promote various branches that he owned. Not only did Little Sully agree to be a kid for the summer, he had to be in an advertisement. He and his son were supposed to give testimonials on camera at the end of their stay to support the camp. They would also serve as people who could recommend the camp to others. The company would use them as references to future swappees. <br />
<br />
Big Ed was really liking how his T-shirt hugged his new muscles, and his new rugged voice. It sounded nothing like him! He sounded like a real man now. A deep voiced man! It was such an amazing difference from his old pipsqueak voice. <br />
<br />
The two headed over to Orientation, where they were greeted on stage by the now pint sized version of Sid Ward, who was one of four children on stage that had swapped bodies to provide donor bodies for the boys without male relatives. The boy had dark brown hair slicked up like a greaser. The kid looked like he could actually be in movies. He had a wide grin and a smart voice coming out of him, directing the adults on stage one by one to introduce themselves, and then the kids. He was confident and seemed totally in charge, something somewhat out of place for Camp Tradeheart. <br />
<br />
Sid Ward&#39;s body sat in the audience, looking up at his old body. Sid&#39;s body, housing a boy called Timothy (now Big Tim) looked exactly like the actor John Wesley Shipp, the dad from Dawson&#39;s Creek, in his early 50s, craggy and handsome, with a sexy receding hairline. Sid was in Tim&#39;s body, and was now a smart allecky looking kid with a lot of wavy gelled up hair looking like he just walked out of a magazine. Tim&#39;s mother was a middle income single mother and her son had been doing well in Hollywood. He had been on several television series, doing a lot of singing and dancing and even comedy sketches. He had also done a few serious made for TV movies. He had distinguished himself as a serious actor, but now Big Tim was taking on an adult role for the first time, as it were. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so all of you new men out there, welcome to your new bodies! But we have a little bit of a surprise for you,&quot; the handsome young Hollywood star told them, housing the mind of a man that could be his grandfather. &quot;Now, your dads all know this but we actually have to separate you for some special adult training. As you well know from your counseling sessions, by law we have to separate you and you have to take a parenting course. What you also knew was that there would be a boot camp part of this camp. What we did NOT tell you is that they would be one and the same. For the next two weeks, you will train as army recruits and as parent recruits. You will exercise, you will lift weights, and you will practice with experienced counselors on how to behave like adults. You will be coached on this, on what to say and how to appear and how to carry yourselves. I promise you this will be worth it. Future jobs will look very favorably on all this. Future employment and future education for boys who go to Camp Tradeheart results in a stable income that is usually between 3 and 4 TIMES more than the income of your average father son swap camp. We guarantee results. We are not just giving you a vacation in a new body here. We are teaching you life skills that you will carry with you for the rest of your lives! Wow...this is a good voice, I have to say. Doesn&#39;t this body have a good set of pipes?&quot; Sid got some cheers from the audience. <br />
<br />
Another counselor approached the stage. He was the vice-manager of the camp, the second in command, and the man absolutely dwarfed his boss now. He was bald, but in his early 30s. He had a very stern look to him. He introduced himself as an ex-Marine Corps veteran. He was muscled to an obscene degree, his face had the most perfect permanent stubble, and he had to have been one of the most powerfully built men that anyone there had ever seen. He would later drop stats on his fellow campers. 6&#39;4&quot; and 285 lbs of pure man meat. His eyebrows looked permanently furrowed, as if he had an angry look but that was due to his prominent, very horizontal brow. His voice punched through the air, thick and pulsing with power. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Mark Badham. If you have any questions, my door is always open. I want to say something here. New men, you will act like men from here on as much as you can. Now that does not mean you can&#39;t have fun and fool around. But. I want you to take the next two weeks very, very seriously. We are going to give you a crash course on being adults. Then, after that period, we will reintroduce you back to live with your new sons. Then, you will spend a month together, learning to do things as a team. We will have arts and crafts, canoeing, obstacle courses. We even have events that are Big vs Little. We call that the Swap Olympics.&quot; Mr. Badham smiled. &quot;After that month is over, we will enter into a week where Big and Little will separate again, so the Big men can meet some nice womenfolk in the area and maybe go to a few adult venues in town. Boys, you&#39;ll be having lots of fun here. We have more than enough activities planned, including wildlife tours. You will also be camping in specially set up tents and we&#39;ll have ghost story nights. It&#39;s a lot of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now, we&#39;d like you to say your goodbyes. We are going to drive the new Big Men TONIGHT to the location on the other side of the lake. They&#39;re going to move into different cabins, and you will see them in two weeks! I will be spending the next two weeks with the Little boys and Mark here, is with the New Big Men.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, guys. Say your goodbyes. We&#39;re gonna have you pack up everything. For your clothing, do not worry. You are going to get special army uniforms. Straight from the army surplus store. You guys are gonna look RAD in these.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New boys, new Littles, new Sons, stay here. We are going to continue our night together. I have some things to talk to you about. Then we&#39;re going to go to the cafeteria and get some grub! The food here is really, really great, you guys. We don&#39;t spare expense on the food. You have high quality meals here, very nutritious and delicious,&quot; <br />
<br />
It was shocking and a little jarring to lose each other so soon after arrival, but with all the promises of what the camp had to offer, everyone was excited,&quot; Sid Ward told them, and looked way, way up at his vice-manager. &quot;I always get dizzy when I swap and I have to look up to this guy right here. He&#39;s like a mountain!&quot; he joked. <br />
<br />
Soon, the boys were packed, and had put their belongings, or rather their father&#39;s belongings, into the vehicles which would transport them to the camp across the lake, which was a military boot camp in structure and form. <br />
<br />
Upon arrival, Big Ed was excited. He didn&#39;t have his dad bossing him around anymore. He was all by himself! He was going to be on his own without his dad for two whole weeks! This was so cool! he thought. <br />
<br />
When they had unpacked, it was getting late. They would have dinner soon, in the mess hall. The food was better than army food, Mark Badham promised them. <br />
<br />
The food was good, and the setting of the mess hall was actually very cozy. The mountain summer air was cooler than expected, and soon the dishes were being finished off. Most of the boys had now huge appetites and they were amazed at how much food they could put away. Many took small portions because that&#39;s what they were used to, only to come up for seconds and thirds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, men. Let&#39;s start tonight off with some adult fun, huh?&quot; Mark told them from a platform at the end of the hall. He had his microphone in one hand and a large Dominican cigar in the other. &quot;Now a lot of you may think it&#39;s going to be really hard to be at this camp and you might be right. But it has it&#39;s benefits! You are all MEN now, and you all have the same rights as adult men now. That means...&quot; he made a motion with his fingers. A few of the counselors came out and started handing out cigars to each one of the men from balsa wood boxes. &quot;I am going to teach you now how to smoke cigars. If you don&#39;t want to, that&#39;s fine,&quot; he told the room of 42 adult men. &quot;If you want to be pussies, that&#39;s fine,&quot; he smirked. Big Ed thought he felt nervous at that point. Big Lewis, who had been convinced to go by &quot;Big Lou&quot; by the counselors, merely grinned the biggest grin. Big Ed was glad he hadn&#39;t taken his dad&#39;s body but he could appreciate his dad&#39;s good looks. Still, he was absolutely huge now. His tattoo covered biceps and gruff voice made him feel like a superhero! <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, this is great! My dad smokes these all the time! You&#39;ll love em&#39;. I know he does!&quot; Big Lou held the cigar in his hands. He was so excited! <br />
<br />
&quot;That smells...goooood.&quot; Big Ed said, after Mr. Badham told them to remove the wrappers. He held the cigar under his nose like Mr. Badham told them to. Clipped it with the provided clippers. Watched Mr. Badham carefully as he inhaled it too much and then choked. Several of the new Big Men laughed at him. Others were choking, but Mr. Badham told them to simply puff as they lit their cigars, to make sure they were merely puffing to get the things going. Before too long, they were all puffing. Men were hollering and shouting and laughing as they smoked stogies for the first time, an entire room of newly independent adult men who were doing something that had been forbidden to them until just now. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna grow a mustache!&quot; Big Lou said. He was feeling his new stubble, quite happily obsessed with it. He smoked and inhaled a long trail of smoke upwards. New Men were still experimenting and laughing as they talked when Mr. Badham interrupted: <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and...let&#39;s bring these boys some beer! Whaddya say, boys?&quot; <br />
<br />
The New Men all cheered as the keg was brought out. <br />
<br />
&quot;You get two cups only, boys. There&#39;s a sticker on your cups. You get a second sticker put under there for your second cup and then you can return them. Again, you get two cups only.&quot; <br />
<br />
Medium sized red plastic cups flowed with golden ambrosia. Most of the New Men laughed and said it tasted terrible. The other half automatically took to it. Big Ed loved the taste of it. His mouth was used to it, it seemed. He had a bit of a beer gut to prove it, even though his muscles elsewhere bulged pretty well. Big Lou didn&#39;t like the taste at all. But he drank two whole cups to be polite. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I feel great! I didn&#39;t think I liked beer at first, but I really do!&quot; Big Lou said, flexing his biceps and looking at himself in a nearby mirror. &quot;Your dad is pretty strong, even though my dad is way stronger. I mean..you are. You&#39;re stronger. My dad has like 19 inch biceps. What about your dad? I think these are like 13 inches. Not that bad, right? Grrr!&quot; <br />
<br />
Wow, my dad&#39;s body does look really great, Big Ed thought. Maybe I should have taken it. Maybe it could have made us closer. Oh well. I have this body and I love it. I can&#39;t wait to lift something heavy! <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, it&#39;s almost bedtime. You all are going to have new uniforms given to you now. Line up at the tables outside to receive your new uniforms. You will get three pairs of pants, shirts, boots and dog tags. You guys are Men now. How excited are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
A chorus of cheers came from the audience. <br />
<br />
Mr. Badham smiled with a grin that creeped out Big Ed. It seemed like he was planning something as he looked out onto all of them. When their eyes met, he felt like turning away. As if he didn&#39;t want Badham to know he was thinking about him. He suddenly felt funny about all this. But the beer felt so good he forgot about his feeling soon enough. He staggered to a bathroom after he got his new army clothes and whipped out his new cock. <br />
<br />
It was 9 inches long and thick as fuck. What was it...7 inches around at the base? He couldn&#39;t believe his luck. This biker was fucking packing the biggest dick imaginable! He started stroking it. Mr. Badham had told them that they would be having urges and that it was okay to stroke their new big dicks. He couldn&#39;t control himself. Soon he was thinking of all the beach movies he&#39;d innocently watched, somewhat interested in the women who seemingly floated along the beach as if they were in outer space, their big boobs and their cunts covered only with those skimpy beach uniforms...<br />
<br />
He came buckets. The first wave of orgasm hit and he was stunned by how much he wanted more. Then another. The burning sensation was like fireworks erupting from his dick. He couldn&#39;t remember ever feeling this good before. Endorphins flooded through his body. His engorged member came an additional three times, with some encouragement by stroking. <br />
<br />
&quot;GRRRRRRRR! URRRRRRRRRHHHHH! URRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  RRRRGGGGHHHHHHHH!&quot; Spurts of cum leapt out one after another. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what are you doing in there?&quot; asked another grown up voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, it felt so good,&quot; Big Ed said from his bathroom stall. &quot;You have to try this! Dude, it&#39;s incredible!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? It&#39;s that good?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. It&#39;s really that good. It&#39;s SO good! Oh, man. This is gonna rock!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Soon the other man, who he couldn&#39;t see, was moaning in another stall, then whimpering, then nearly crying. He made a lot more noise on his way to orgasm than Big Ed had. He heard in fascination as the man jacked off for the first time and came. <br />
<br />
He staggered back to his cabin and fell fast asleep, with Big Lou on the opposite side of the tent. The tent was very thick canvas and not flimsy at all. It stood on a wooden deck above the earth. It was heaven, he thought, as he drifted off to his dreams.</p>
