<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You don't know whether to groan in alarm or cheer at what you see before you. Clutched in one hand is the note with your wish, while in your other hand is a hand-held mirror. Peering into the reflective depths, taking in what you see before you, you think back to the day.<br />
<br />
It started with you being woken up and being addressed by the girl's name, Heather. From there, things just got weirder as you noticed first your body taking on a more feminine appearance, your sister and mother treating you like a girl, you finding out that you are on the swim team and not the basketball team and then your friend's transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that something to be expected,&quot; you think to yourself as you think of Jake, who now goes by the name Jamie.<br />
<br />
Boarding the bus, you immediately sat down next to your friend, but it takes a moment for you to realise that your friend is not the person they where last time you saw them, even though you addressed them by a girl's name.<br />
<br />
Shaking your head, thinking, &quot;This is getting a little to much for me,&quot; as you set the mirror down next to you and then look at the note, rereading your wish.<br />
<br />
After you arrived at school, you soon realised that it wasn't just your friend and your family that had changed, but all the people you interact with on a normal day to day schedule - as you find them not only treating you like, but also addressing you by a girl's name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I adjust to being called Heather,&quot; you ask yourself, as you think of the swim-meet.<br />
<br />
The day had passed, no matter how weird you thought it had been and then you found yourself, undressing in the girl's locker room, chatting away with Jamie about various subjects as if there was nothing out of place, only noticing out of the corner of your eye that Jamie's body also looked a lot more feminine then you remember and that, even though everyone treated her like a female, she had a tiny penis and testicles, much like you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And things only got weirder,&quot; you tell yourself as you pick up the mirror and go back to examining the area of your body you had been looking at a couple minutes earlier.<br />
<br />
After the swim-meet, you showered and prepared to change, giving only slight pause when Jamie started talking to you, noticing her body was even more feminine look then it was an hour ago and her penis and testicles had shrunk so much, they were now between her legs.<br />
<br />
And then, before you could fully grasp what was happening, Jamie looked around the deserted locker room and then leaning close to you, she pressed her lips against yours.<br />
<br />
Shocked, you didn't know really what to do and then, figuring you should go with it, you returned her kiss, liking the way her body was pressed up against yours. And then she was pushing away from you, looking at you with a curious look on her face. Moving closer, you brush a strand of hair off her face, as she tells you, &quot;I've wanted to do that for about three years now. Does that make me bad in some way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking you head, suddenly realising that you are attracted to her just as much as she is clearly attracted to you, you tell her, &quot;No. It doesn't make you bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess that's just one of the facts of life,&quot; you think as you look into the reflective surface, taking in your privates, which have also changed considerably since you and Jamie confessed your love no more then two hours ago.<br />
<br />
Touching the studs in your ears - you had them pierced shortly after your mother picked you up - you think on the fact that it looks like you have a really pronounced vulva growing, giving you the appearance of having what some of the girl's called a 'Camel's Toe'. Between your legs, the lips majour and minour had started to form and when you spread them apart, you could just make out the vaginal opening and what at one time was clearly your penis, now split in two.<br />
<br />
Sighing, thinking that your transformation to being a girl was almost over, you stood up from where you are lying on the carpet, retrieve your pants and boxers and begin putting them back on.<br />
<br />
Redressed from the waist down, you put the mirror back in the drawer you had taken it from and then, picking up the note, you ask yourself, &quot;Is this something I want? Is this something I can deal with? Can I learn to be a girl, like I wished for? One who is clearly a lesbian?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking about how you can slip so easily into doing things a girl would normally do, you think that given enough time, you would probably forget your life as a male entirely.<br />
<br />
Bothered by such a prospect, you look about your room, taking in that it to has changed and now resembled a room suitable for a fifteen year old girl. Reaching down, you touch you body, almost as to make sure it is real and then gently trace each and every curve - including those that are just forming. Looking back at the note, you stroll across the room and open the window.<br />
<br />
Peering out, you glance back down at the note and then, before you can change your mind, you fold it up and then toss it out the window. Watching the wind catch the piece of paper and carry it away, you think about your new life and then figure you want to call and talk to Jamie.<br />
<br />
Turning away from the window, you exit the room. Outside, the wind carries the note far and then, eventually, someone else finds it. But who?</p>
