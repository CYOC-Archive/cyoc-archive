<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Hannah smiled and bounded off. She
didn't know why, but she loved making
sudden departures like that. She probably
should've said goodbye to Keith, though.
She was impressed; out of all the people
to whom she played informal counselor,
Keith had made the fastest progress she'd
seen in the entire six months she'd been
here. There's always room for improvement,
though, and in his case Hannah felt that
he still saw the world as a sort of Vast
Male Conspiracy. Not to that extent, of
course, but still...She'd picked up a few
hints about Keith's past that gave her
some idea of what went on in his mind, but
for the most part he didn't want to talk
about it.</p>
<p>What she did know was that Cathy had
been painfully single all her life, and
she'd picked up hints that Cathy had spent
most of her career playing underling to
various men. That, Hannah supposed, would
leave one a little biased, but she hoped
that he'd eventually get past that notion
and see that life was really more of a
power balance between the sexes, depending
on the culture. That had been part of her
motive in trying to arrange a meeting
between the two panthermorphs. Mostly it
was for Jackie, who needed to come to
terms with her new identity;; Hannah
figured Keith could function as a clear
example of someone who had clearly done
so, and hey, it couldn't hurt if a
relationship formed between the two...but
it had also been partly for Keith, who
needed to learn from a male or once-male
that manhood wasn't the solution to every
problem.</p>
<p>Hannah smiled to herself. She was
excited about the prospecting of staying
on as a transgender counselor, but she
hoped that if it did work out they
wouldn't put her under too much scrutiny.
She understood that psychological
professionals frowned on using patient
interactions for treatment purposes, but
on the other hand, she felt that it was
pretty absurd to think one <i>could</i>
isolate one's patients from each other,
especially in an environment like this, so
wasn't it better to harness those
interactions for the mutual benefit of all
involved? Besides, who would expect an
electronics engineer turned doe morph to
know anything about psychological ethics,
anyway?</p>
<p>Hannah was distracted from her thoughts
by a noise off to her forward-right.
Walking over to investigate, she beheld a
handsome young buck, wandering aimlessly.
He wasn't the most powerful-looking stag
she'd seen, but he was attractive
nonetheless, rather lightly built but
still muscular. A six-pointer, too. Hannah
knew that it really didn't have anything
to do with anything, but she'd discovered
that she really did find a buck with a
full rack more attractive. At least, she
did when he wasn't swaying his hips in a
comical fashion.</p>
<p>"You're still walking like a woman,"
she laughed. "Tell me, did you decide to
experiment with being male, or did the
'random' button give you a surprise?"</p>
<p>The buck turned at the sound of her
voice. "H-how did you know?" he asked.
"Um, and it was the button."</p>
<p>"I told you," Hannah said. "Your walk
is giving it all away. You'll want to fix
that pronto, unless you want even the
people who haven't sex-changed to figure
out. And trust me, you don't."</p>
<p>"Everybody who hasn't sex-changed?" he
repeated. "Then...?"</p>
<p>Hannah nodded. "Yep. I got smote by the
Random Number God, too."</p>
<p>She waited for a response, but the buck
was occupied in staring at her. Hannah had
been checked out plenty of times in the
past six months, so it was nothing new.
But this was the only time she could think
of where the guy didn't seem to be leering
at her and her sizable breasts; despite
his minor yet visible arousal, the buck
seemed to be mostly just curious and
confused by his new feelings.</p>
<p>When she felt it had gone on long
enough, she gave a slight cough. He
immediately snapped to attention in the
classic
back-rigid-shoulders-squared-stare-straight-ahead pose, but instead of the usual
nothing-going-on-here look, he appeared to
be embarrassed. "I...I'm sorry," he
said.</p>
<p>"It happens," Hannah shrugged. "You're
new at this, I'll overlook it. But you'll
want to work on not doing that,
mister...?"</p>
<p>"Sally," the buck replied. "It won't
happen again; I'm really sorry."</p>
<p>"We'll call you Sam," Hannah said. "I
used to be Harry, but I go by Hannah now.
And it's fine, really. Everyone in our
position has some trouble getting used to
it at first."</p> <p>"'Sam?'"</p> <p>She
nodded. "I make it my prerogative to give
new names to the gender-changed guests.
And speaking of getting used to it, I run
a sort of support group for sex-changed
guests. We meet nightly on the big
freaking rock along the park fenceline.
We'd love to have you."</p> <p>Sam smiled
sheepishly. "Get used to it? I'm not sure
I-"</p> <p>Hannah cut him off. "Nobody's
saying you have to embrace it, but we can
help get through your stay with a minimum
of trouble, anyway." She smiled at him.
"Please?"</p>
<p>"Well," he began, "I...well...all
right."</p>
<p>"I'll see you there, Sam," Hannah
called as she bounded off, excited.
Finally, a buck who didn't appear to be
angling for random sex! That had been her
pet peeve during her whole stay. Thanks to
the stag's reputation for potency, it was
a form chosen pretty much solely by frat
boys and shabby forty-somethings
undergoing mid-life-crises, both groups
hoping to get laid. A lot. And so, as both
one of the few does in the park (few
ladies chose to be deer, precisely because
of the type of guys who <i>did</i>) and
one of the more 'stacked' girls in the
park (truly a mixed blessing,) Hannah got
propositioned fairly often. Sometimes
they'd even just assume she was looking
for a good time and start putting the
moves on her in front of God and
everybody. It was like one antler held
excess ego and the other excess lust. But
this new guy...well, not only was he
embarrassed to be staring at her rather
than embarrassed to get caught, he
actually apologized for it! Hannah smiled
to herself. She wasn't going to rush
things, but she thought that maybe she'd
finally found someone she could have a
relationship with.</p></p>
