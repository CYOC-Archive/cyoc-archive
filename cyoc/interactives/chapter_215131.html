<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wednesday morning, Allison found herself sitting in the chair that was usually reserved for guests. She wore a nice blouse, and a cute skirt which felt a little odd. She and Ava had been experimenting with her Adrian persona and she had gone to bed as a boy, with his girlfriend curled up next to him. This morning, she returned to being a girl, but the longer stay as a boy made her old familiar body feel somewhat alien. Allison wondered if the chronivac helped you adapt to whatever form it turned you into since Ava had said something similar about returning to being human for the night. Perhaps the longer she left someone in a certain form, the more natural that form was to them. She would have to experiment later. Now Ava was once again a cat, happily purring in Allison&#39;s lap. The both of them were waiting for their interview to start.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mornings with Mandy&quot; was a local talk show that was very popular. It had been going on for 20 years, with Mandy as the sexy and charismatic host. However, the sexy side of the show had deteriorated some as Mandy was approaching 50.  She had some work done to try and combat the ravages of time, but sooner or later her looks would fade.<br />
<br />
Mandy didn&#39;t realize it, but Allison had decided to solve that problem for her. Well, at least she would put it off for her. Mandy sat next to her, wearing an elegant red gown, that compliment her auburn hair nicely. That hair was once natural, but sitting this close, Allison could see hints of Mandy&#39;s grey roots.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t much of a chance to talk before the cameras started rolling, and airing the footage live. Mandy smiled at the camera and began speaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, and welcome to Mornings with Mandy. Today I have local Stream Queen Allison who has taken the internet by storm by showcasing her ability to transform anyone, anywhere.&quot; Mandy turned from the camera towards Allison. &quot;Now I assume that cat is Ava, the former goth girl form your recent show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison smiled back and gave her cat a loving pet. &quot;You would be correct. I recently returned her to human, but she couldn&#39;t wait to become a cat again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did mention it was a life long dream.&quot; Mandy commented. &quot;Now, with the success of your last episode, what do you plan to do next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Mandy, my regular show is done with my computer camera in my room. Pretty low tech. My next episode will be live streamed from the basketball stadium, and will be the first time ever that I will perform for a live audience. We will have a professional camera crew, so I hope you can really enjoy the changes taking place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The basketball stadium?&quot; Mandy asked. &quot;Not the football?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I considered it, but lighting is so much better in an indoors stage and I don&#39;t have to worry about wind or rain getting in the way of my show.&quot; While Allison said the weather was a part of her decision, she probably could control that with the chronivac, like she did when she made people accept the changes, or altered reality so she would be offered the stadium for her show free of charge as well as this interview.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who will you be changing?&quot; Mandy continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;That depends. Who bought a ticket?&quot; Allison smiled. &quot;I will only be changing people who are there in person this time around. Anyone in the audience is fair game, whether they volunteer or I want to pick a surprise participant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds exciting. So, not everyone you pick is necessarily planning to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The may not be planning on it, but there is a waver informing them its a possibility.&quot; Allison confirmed. &quot;We also have some surprise guests who will not be announced until we start streaming. Some of them will be there to perform while others are going to participate in the show.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see who they are. Now, back to the surprise changes you were talking about. Are you afraid people will decide not to buy tickets to avoid unwanted change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. According to the responses I&#39;ve gotten from subscribers, a large amount are coming from out of town, and out of state. I even have a few trying to make quick plans to arrive from out of country.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is simply amazing Allison. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen someone gain so much success in such a short time. Is there anything else you can tell us about Saturday&#39;s show?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison smiled only grew. &quot;We will also be announcing the results of my new sister&#39;s fundraiser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy nodded. &quot;Right, the more people donate, the longer she remains a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Each donation buys her another hour as a girl. However, until the show this Saturday she will remain female free of charge. We will announced how much girl time was bought during the stream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I bought a few hours myself. It goes to a great cause, and the world could always use another girl in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it will temporarily have one less Saturday night. Since I have a certain number of fans who felt cheated that Adrian made such a short appearance last time, I&#39;ve decided to do the entire stream as a boy. I know some people may worry about there being no eye candy, but I convinced Ava to co-host as a human as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait. Is there anyway we could get a preview of the show?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Allison pulled out her cell phone. She had managed to link the chronivac to it, and altered reality so she was the only one who could use it on her phone.<br />
<br />
Pulling up the app on her phone she quickly brought up Mandy&#39;s information. &quot;Now everybody, watch Mandy closely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Mandy asked slightly confused. <br />
<br />
Allison found the age setting and changed it from 48 to 14. Everyone watched as Mandy aged in reverse. The work she had done was erased and her natural beauty returned with her youth. She briefly returned to the young bombshell she was when she started, but continued regressing passed that, shrinking in height slightly as she approached her teeny bopper years.<br />
<br />
The audience cheered as Mandy looked at herself shocked. She was about to speak but Allison wasn&#39;t finished. Under occupation she changed &#39;Morning Show Host&#39; to &#39;High School Cheerleader&#39;.<br />
<br />
Now it was her dresses turn to shrink. The gown had reached her ankles, now receded revealing her legs. The single colored garment changed to have white mixed in while the words &quot;Rams&quot; appeared on her chest. That was Allison&#39;s school Mascot.<br />
<br />
Ribbons appeared from nowhere and tied her hair in a ponytail. Mandy was speechless. She was now showing more leg then she had been comfortable with in years, and she felt full of energy. <br />
<br />
Allison took charge of the show. &quot;If you want to see more of Mandy, tune in to my stream Saturday night where she will be interviewing some of the guests from my previous episode who are flying out to join us live.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy quickly looked at Allison who was typing on her phone. &quot;I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Finishing the changes she wanted to reality, Allison hit entered. &quot;Until then we really need to go. I can&#39;t miss all of school today, and Mandy needs to stop by the front office to get her new schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that they waved at the audience and the cameras cut off, ending the show 45 minutes early. The producers hadn&#39;t realized it was the last episode of Monrnings with Mandy when they invited Allison on but they were now desperately looking for a new host, and name for Thursdays episode. <br />
<br />
Allison hadn&#39;t included that in her update to reality. She believed in free will, mostly, and wanted them to chose themselves. The main change to make sure Mandy would be enrolled in her school and on the cheer team, as well as help her focus on the positive aspect of being young again.</p>
