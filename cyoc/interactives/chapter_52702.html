<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, the idea of transferring a soul into a body it hadn't been born into let alone had <br />
meant to be in the first place, had not been looked well upon by... well, -many- religions <br />
(many who loathed to admit they agreed with others). <br />
<br />
Ironically, it was he gargoyles themselves that were abhorrent to do this, since the new <br />
gargoyles kept their original memories, personalities, and loyalties: many 'natural' <br />
gargoyles consider these 'false gargoyles' to be 'impure' and a threat to the gargoyle <br />
consistency that the living stone creatures took so much pride in.  And saw the <br />
introductions of creatures who were not directly cloned from a previous gargoyle as <br />
horrendously unnatural.   So the ritual of transferring souls into a gargoyle body had been <br />
a -very- great taboo among gargoyles, being about as welcome as pedophiles were <br />
among humans. <br />
<br />
When the terrible purge of the Knight Templar had begun as a pretense to cease the <br />
Templar's assets, some had actually come to the stone creatures imploring membership...  <br />
They were now safely hidden among the statuary of the Vatican, centuries later, the secret <br />
line of defense of the heart of an entire faith. <br />
<br />
'Though personally,' Marie Cruz thought in the late sixteen hundreds, standing what <br />
would be reorganized one day into the Holy Office staring out at the silent ever watchful <br />
guardians, 'I wonder if they even still remember being humans after all this time...' <br />
<br />
Marie was relatively good at what she did, if you didn't count her glaring handicap of <br />
missing an eye. The blond inquesitor didn't mind, she had often been able to see things <br />
with that lost eye that others couldn't.<br />
<br />
And of course, there was the small fact she was a woman: and thus was both officially --<br />
unoffical--, below the radar, and considered totally -expendable.- <br />
<br />
The Inquisition had been established in name to root out people who were taking the <br />
message and creed of their theology and twisting it to mean what they wished it to mean, <br />
but in practice seemed to only be directed towards people with attractive holdings that <br />
the king then took into his own hands. <br />
<br />
She also could sense that the Inquisition in it's current incarnation was coming to it's <br />
close. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Inquisition and it's courts do not recognize, nor humor the superstitious belief in the <br />
existence of witchcraft or sorcerery!&quot; The Council of the Suprema had told her to her face <br />
on a Tuesday afternoon (since that was normally when they were closed and not in <br />
session), &quot;And we will not grant resources to such a ridiculous  fantastic quest!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz had seen that one coming. her other eye had shown her.  It was hard to <br />
convince the Council of the Suprema when the corpse of what had torn out her eye had <br />
turned to dust when the sunlight hit it. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz did have one advantage in that she wasn't married, which meant her own <br />
resources didn't belong to a husband instead of her. So if she was lucky she'd be able to <br />
catch a boat to the new world and to the small town of Glendale.  The Council of the <br />
Suprema couldn't accuse her of abandoning her post if she didn't officially exist. <br />
<br />
'If I'm to kill three witches set on turning a small town into a hole of insane creatures that <br />
will not even be called human... I'm going to need some friends.' <br />
<br />
She had five years. Five short years to find allies and to travel to a small town named <br />
Glendale in the new world. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Betty asked the obvious question, &quot;So this Marie Cruz was one of the five witch hunters <br />
who came to Glendale?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie the wolf sighed, wolves didn't have last name after all, they were supposed to be <br />
connected purely to their pack.  &quot;If you want to call her as such, yes. Though she'd have <br />
hated to be called such. She, like the Inquisition, knew the vast majority of witch hunters <br />
were superstitious paranoids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence asked the more obvious question,  &quot;If she knew what was going to happen in <br />
Glendale, why didn't she go there at once when the witches were still just little girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She had no idea where Glendale was. Second sight doesn't work like that. She just knew <br />
when the witches would start reeking havoc, and the name of the town and what land <br />
mass it would be on. Plus she knew she'd end up an insane cow-woman thing creature if <br />
she came alone. Gaal, Gamorrah, and Galgatha would become powerful and terrible <br />
indeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Came we get back to the little girls?&quot; Casandra asked. &quot;They were cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly said sounding interested, &quot;So this Marie Cruz, did she really hunt vampires?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie shrugged, &quot;I don't think I'll tell you. Since it's not the point. I'll apologized, that I <br />
skipped somewhat ahead. Let me backtrack back to the girls. Marie Cruz and her <br />
companions don't appear until the end of the three girls and their friend's story.&quot; <br />
<br />
'It would be so much easier if this was just Kaylee's dream... but in spite of what some <br />
pathetic, self-important, arrogant, god-complex, commanding, pig-headed, small, petty, <br />
blind, egotistical, deluded souls think, this is no illusion upon either Kaylee or Jensen's....' <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
Zack laying down, his titan like body a gashed and broken mess, turned his head at the <br />
pearl colored she wolf changing his bedpan,  &quot;Beautiful you should stop, get some rest.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pearl was dirty with blood, her fur was unkept, and she looked so tired. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's okay, I'm the only part of our circle that isn't hurt... it's my responsibility...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You called Isabelle Hope, Hope Grace, and Grace Isabelle...&quot; Zack pointed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's, it's nothing handsome, it was just a mistake.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was common knowledge among the pack that Grace, Hope, and Isabelle were except for <br />
their hair styles and fur color were exact replicas of Kaylee. Some joked they must have <br />
been quadruplets in a former life.   Then it was harshly pointed out by Kaylee that they <br />
were quadruplets, FRATERNAL quadruplets... and no, their different fur colors were NOT a <br />
dye job. <br />
<br />
Kaylee's parents suddenly remembered having four cubs instead of one, and three families <br />
in Glendale suddenly felt like they had forgotten something, -someone-, very very -very- <br />
important, but for they couldn't remember who for the lives of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;A mistake where you got your sister-wives mixed up. PLEASE Pearl,&quot; Zack implored, <br />
&quot;Don't make yourself sick. Zelipe doesn't need both his parents to worry about... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Julie and Roger is taking a nap too, don't worry about us. We'll be fine for a few hours...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just go already.&quot; June managed to say very harshly and almost imposing in spite of having <br />
a broken tail and a fractured hip and a several new lines of claw marks down her back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Pearl nodded and wandered off out of the medical wing, she only got as far as <br />
the giant statue in entry way before she laid beside it and fell asleep. No one saw or <br />
perceived the statue changing position so Pearl was lying more comfortably. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
An elderly woman in a wheelchair in a nursing home watched her soup operas not really <br />
paying attention to the plot, it just being noise to drown out the silence.  When few spoke <br />
to her, it was to talk about her great ancestors had helped found Glendale. Few ever <br />
listened. <br />
<br />
  Mrs. Glen heard the phone ring.  <br />
<br />
Daring to hope the old woman picked it up on her own (in spite of what some of the <br />
nurses thought. It was her family! To be precise her great granddaughter.  Having outlived <br />
her son and daughter in law had been something no woman should have to endure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Penny!&quot; mrs. Glen shouted, &quot;How's my favorite little lion girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I'm fine great-granny... it's just... well... &quot; Reality hadn't adjusted yet for Penny's <br />
injuries, and being away from the others, reality hadn't gotten to rewriting her memories <br />
yet, so she was still unsure of being called female and a lion as if nothing had changed. <br />
&quot;Well, do you remember... Kirk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wonderful man who got turned into a statue? What about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, er, that is... he's alive again, and she says, I mean he says that he wants us to be <br />
married as soon as --&quot; She stopped before saying she was in a wheelchair for a month. &quot;-<br />
-as soon as we're able.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH DEAR THAT'S WONDERFUL!&quot; Mrs. Glen nearly had a heart attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great-Granny! Be careful! You don't want to tax yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't be so down dear! I know how devastated you were when you lost Kirk! How did <br />
you save him? Who saved him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny said, &quot;Uh, kind of a long story, I'd ... er, rather tell you in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Sounds like there are some things you aren't sure of. I'll be sure to ask you about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Great-Granny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be over to your place--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I mean, great-granny I'm kinda at Kirk's parents home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I remember where that is, I'll be over soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But great-granny you shouldn't-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me worry about that dear, I'm so happy for you.&quot;  The old woman put the phone down, <br />
a lot more strength in her arms than a moment ago. <br />
<br />
She began to wheel out of her room, then slowly stepped out of the chair should should <br />
never have been able to walk out of again, and took a few steps. <br />
<br />
Fur as white as snow covered her entire body, her white hair becoming just fur leaving her <br />
bald as her round ears moved to the top of her head. Her eyes a brownish red. Her hands <br />
and feet became thick paws identical. Her face twisted into a muzzle as her teeth became <br />
dedicated for tearing apart meant. Look near identical to any other lioness. <br />
<br />
A plum tail snaked out of her dress even as it dissolved around her like the wheel chair <br />
behind her. Naked except for her fur. The lioness walked down the hall hunching over and <br />
waving at the other residents who waved back. <br />
<br />
Then her hips and shoulders rearranged, and she calmly got on all fours, her body suited <br />
for the task perfectly. Tribal tattoos appeared on her 'shoulders' and hind quarters. And <br />
she grew, becoming twice the size of any mundane lioness.  There was no grayness in her <br />
fur. And her body was built to last.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; She said calmly to two senior citizens playing cards who were in her way. <br />
They quickly but calmly got of the way for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good day Mother Glen.&quot; Said the nurse at the front counter nodding at the beast walk <br />
right past her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good day dearie.&quot; Replied Mother Glen. <br />
<br />
No one screamed or ran or called animal control as Mother Glen left the nursing home on <br />
her own.  She was after all the eldest of the Pride like Mr. P was the eldest of the Pack. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Julie pointed at the violet single wolf, &quot;Okay, Sasha, you, Terri and Sandi work with the <br />
pride with me and Jasmine. They're more mangled than our pack mates are.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla said to the other single wolf, &quot;Trinity, Sunny, Luna, you'll work with me on our pack <br />
mates. Be sure to help Akane, Umeko, and Eri with Chiyoye and Yamato when they ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you forgetting someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How we can we help Doctor?&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie and Darla turned as one and opened their muzzle happily (as did Fran in her sleep) <br />
and hugged the two tri-sheeva wolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;JOY! INGRID! You're -you- again!&quot; The triplet said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we are.&quot; Nodded Joy's three heads. &quot;And we're reporting for duty doctor!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We need your help more than ever!&quot; Julie said, &quot;Joy you'll work with me! Ingird, follow <br />
Darla's instructions!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Doctor!&quot; The two nurse wolves replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how was it having only one head?&quot; Terri just HAD to ask. Sandi elbowed Terri in <br />
response. <br />
<br />
Joy however said after a moment of contemplation, &quot;Crowded.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie was glade to see her two nurses. The time separated from Fran and Darla during her <br />
time at medical school had been pure and absolute torture.  The link between the triplets <br />
defied all medical science, and even spiritualists were left scratching their heads. But it <br />
was very real all the same, and being pulled apart was like having two thirds of her soul <br />
missing.  Many other twins were didn't like how the triplets encouraged certain <br />
stereotypes, but the triplets were proud of what they were. They were parts of a whole, <br />
they completed each other, and it was a greater comforting sense of unity that rivaled that <br />
of their unity with the pack. <br />
<br />
And she had been denied that at medical collage. She had starved it off for a short time by <br />
sheer will power, but her grade slowly nose dived as her psyche couldn't coup. The <br />
psychologists were of no help in the least.  She didn't WANT to be independent from her <br />
sisters as they suggested. She loved being part of them as they were a part of her. To feel <br />
the same, to think the same, to look the same, to be the same. <br />
<br />
Elise had been sent to the principle's office a decade before for punching out a boy who <br />
had called the triplets 'borg.'<br />
<br />
She had been close to calling it quits and taking a correspondence course, or suffer a <br />
complete nervous break down when the two tri-sheeva wolves had chosen out of random <br />
compassion to comfort her one night. <br />
<br />
They had been a piece of medical marvel to Julie (as all sheeva wolves were) but what had <br />
really kept her had been that they acted as good stop gaps for Fran and Darla. Not to say <br />
that she replaced her sisters, but for a while seeing the two near identical wolves with <br />
three of nearly everything had been a comforting placebo. <br />
<br />
Of course Julie had to later apologize for 'using' them, but the sisters had told her that <br />
they were glade to be of service... Julie didn't want to think about what her life might have <br />
been like if she had never met her two favorite nurses. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
With the gallery wolves at Big Bad Island being sent aid the teen wolves in the long <br />
overdue task of returning the herd to the estate, no one saw the three statues in the <br />
gallery become flesh and blood again. <br />
<br />
&quot;This should be good.&quot; Nelson said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes indeed.&quot; Leslie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope so.&quot; Helen added. <br />
<br />
The three walked down past Kira, who they waved at. <br />
<br />
The beheld the fountain. And without hesitation or a second thought they began to step <br />
into the center. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ar you sure about this?&quot; Helen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Dare and Transform protects us remember?&quot; Nelson said, &quot;There's nothing to worry <br />
about.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three stood back to back, their tails intertwining and their rear cheeks pushing against <br />
each other. Then they were marble like the fountain, their bodies fused with it. In the <br />
name of good taste, the open that the water come out of the wolves was their mouths that <br />
went into the bastion below. <br />
<br />
Tatuli turned and looked at the fountain and said, &quot;I always thought that the statues on <br />
that fountain looked really cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and stone statues.&quot; The reddish black Nneli said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You and glass statues.&quot; Tatuli retorted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sisters.&quot; Mbili said getting between them. &quot;Play nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moja and Tano ignored them and shouted loudly to the amethyst colored she-wolf and her <br />
wards. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!!!! Lions rule! Wolves drool!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NANE!&quot; The three all said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Got their attention didn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Shouted Giselle nearly on the other side of the front yard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids, noise.&quot; Amethyst said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; The gold furred twin answered meekly. <br />
<br />
&quot;We challenge ye to battle!&quot; Shouted Nane.<br />
<br />
&quot;What short of battle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You name it! We beat you at it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The seven other cubs there groaned. Her three sisters wondering how they shared <br />
identical genetic material. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I remember? And not the rest of my family?&quot; Kathy wondered of the lion boy who <br />
had turned her into a cat girl and the chaos storm caused by a mysterious thing called <br />
'Kurse'. &quot;Or I just remember for now? I hope I get to thank the kid before I forget then... <br />
He said his name was Trevor right? There can't be that many little boys who are leomen in <br />
Glendale right?... &quot;  Kathy began to write a letter. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Chester meanwhile.. had found the meat locker unguarded for once, and began to pig <br />
out...</p>
