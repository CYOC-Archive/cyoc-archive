<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up and noticed that you weren&#39;t in your house anymore, and you were naked. You began freaking out thinking that you&#39;ve been kidnapped and stripped of your clothes. However when you screamed all that cam out of your mouth was yapping and you sounded like a child imitating a large animal. You then looked at yourself and yapped again once you noticed that your had green scales, wings, claws, and a lizards&#39; tail. You looked around frantically and saw what appeared to be eggs all around you, and there was roughly 5 of them. You then noticed a large emerald green female dragon looming over you, and you noticed that she had breasts that were swollen up with milk, and you were like an infant to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings my little hatchling, welcome to life, or congratulations on being able to open your eyes properly.&quot; The dragon said<br />
<br />
You tried to yell,&quot;Who are you?!&quot; But all you did was let out a series of yaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, now you are impatient Zaxe, and your siblings still haven&#39;t hatched yet. Only 17 years and you are already exhibiting traits of your father. Very well, time to eat.&quot; The female dragon said acting like a mother.<br />
<br />
Before you could piece anything together the female dragon held your up to one of her breast teats. You looked at it and wondered what you should do in this situation. &quot;Oh don&#39;t fret my dear, you&#39;ve done this before just lick, suckle and eat.&quot; The dragon who you assumed is your mother said<br />
<br />
You looked at her puzzled then cautiously closed your mouth around her teat, and began suckling. You felt your mother&#39;s warm milk flow down your throat, and you suckled to your hearts content. &quot;Oh that felt good, drink as much as you like, but don&#39;t be jealous of your brothers and sisters when they come eventually.&quot; Your alleged mother said<br />
<br />
You still couldn&#39;t quite piece together what was happening, but you had minimal teath, and were really young. You still needed to confirm what was happening, and you did this in the only way you knew how. You looked to the female dragon and cocked your head sideways, and said the only word that you could seem to form,&quot;Mama?&quot;<br />
<br />
The female dragon looked at you and smiled, and you saw a tear come to her eye. &quot;Yes, Zaxe I am your mother, oh my your father will be thrilled that you said your first words so early. Zaxe I&#39; so...&quot; Your alleged mother said, and confirmed your situation, but she paused.<br />
<br />
You heard cracking sounds, and you saw three eggs hatch. One of the eggs contained two dragons that were both male and identical in their blue scales, and the other two eggs contained two separate female dragons one was pink, and the other purple. All of the dragons couldn&#39;t see, talk, or even think straight from what you saw. You then saw your mother begin licking each of them, and cleaning them of the yoke from their eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this is just precious, Zaxe these are your brothers and sisters.&quot; Your mother said, and you watched as she carefully handled them and held each of them to her breast and she breastfed each one, and you watched patiently.<br />
<br />
Moments later a male dragon roughly the size of your mother flew through to her, and you and you looked up to see him look down at all of you. &quot;Keca, I apologize for my delay, I was worried about what&#39;s been going on lately and I hesitated when I heard subtle cracking noises.&quot; The male dragon said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you&#39;re fine, three of the eggs hatched, and one of them has twin boys. However I&#39;m not sure about the other two, do you think that they&#39;ll be okay, Hirad?&quot; Your mother asked<br />
<br />
&quot;My sources say wait two and a half decades before discarding, so they have time. So how has our Zaxe been doing?&quot; The male dragon asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, our Zaxe? That has to be my name, but doesn&#39;t that make him my dad?&quot; You thought<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, Zaxe actually spoke, and he called me &quot;mama&quot; I know it&#39;s simple but it shows that he recognizes me as his mother, and he can speak.&quot; Your mother said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, he did? I&#39;d expect him to at least be 30 years old before he would be able to mutter a single phrase.&quot; Your dad said then looked down at you and put his muzzle next to you.<br />
<br />
You for some reason had the urge to playfully bat at your father&#39;s face, and you did by smacking his muzzle with your tiny claws, and laughing. Your dad then laughed and said,&quot;Wow, it seems Zaxe is a bit energetic today, and it&#39;s comforting to see that he has some fight in him, or at least he does for his age.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad the Zaxe spoke, and three of our eggs hatched. We have two twin boys, and two girls from separate eggs. I honestly was thinking of calling one of the girls Yaka, and one of the boys Cero.&quot; Your mom said<br />
<br />
&quot;Which girl though? I think we should call the other boy Buro too.&quot; Your dad asked<br />
<br />
&quot;The pink one, so what should we call the purple one?&quot; Your mom asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, how about Neca? That&#39;s a good name right?&quot; Your dad asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s perfect, but what will we do later with them, and their education?&quot; Your mom asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll educate the boys first, and you the girls. We will then switch duties of teaching every other year, so we can spend equal time with them. If we aren&#39;t sure we can always use Zaxe as the test subject, he is our eldest child.&quot; Your dad said<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I guess, in that case when he&#39;s 480 years old, you will teach him first. Because I already spend time with him, and a father really does need to bond with his sons.&quot; Your mom said<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but let me test something real quick.&quot; Your dad said then looked down towards you, and you were playing with your tail, and wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Zaxe,&quot; your dad started and you looked at him,&quot;Can you say dada? Da...da?&quot; Your dad said repeating the words slowly.<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure if you could say the words correctly with your undeveloped teeth, but you accomplished your father&#39;s task and said,&quot;d...da...da......dada.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He really can talk, heh that&#39;s sweet and...&quot; your dad began, and fell silent staring at you. You suddenly lost what control you had over your bladder, and you pissed onto the cave floor.<br />
<br />
Your dad then sighed and said,&quot;Well I guess now that you can talk, might as well get you cave trained. I guess I&#39;ll clean up the mess then.&quot; <br />
<br />
You gighled awkwardly feeling that your laughter would somehow make the situation better. You had just about forgotten about the old man too, but you still kept a thought in the backmof your head about him.<br />
<br />
(Basically think of dragon aging like this. Every month is a decade for dragons, and every 120 years is one year for a dragon...obviously.)</p>
