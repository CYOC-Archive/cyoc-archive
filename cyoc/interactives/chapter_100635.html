<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle kept looking at his body. he was a swamp creature worthy of a B horror movie or a comic book story. He couldn&#39;t live like that, he couldn&#39;t return home like that what would his parents say, what would his frineds think how would he live?<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me back, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would we?&quot; Sam teased him. Both girls were happy to see him humilliated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because this is just mean, please, I&#39;ll do anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Kyle kneed before the girls and tried to join his hands in a counterproductive attempt. &quot;I am begging you (ribbit), please change me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls looked at each other, giggling and apreciating Kyle downing himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you can make us a favour, we&#39;ll think about. You said you&#39;d do anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle agreed not knowing what they pretended. But whatever was goign trough their minds couldn&#39;t be worse than that. They put a shower towel in Becca&#39;s car, so Kyle&#39;s new slimy skinny wouldn&#39;t stain the seats, they got in the vehicle and drove trough the city. Kyle was terrified that someone looked trought the window and reckognized him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chill Kyle...you&#39;re such a  cute frogman, anyone will like you&quot; Samantha said in the passenger&#39;s seat. The girls drove to the city&#39;s lake, a making-out point for the high schoolers. Samantha told hteir plan to Kyle. Her boyfriend had betrayed her and was now dating Stacey, a blonde bimbo who was famous for being a whore. They were supposed to be at the lake making out in the car, and Kyle was going to be the swamp monster who would attack them and scare the shit out of them. Kyle thougth twice, he knew Smaantha&#39;s ex-boyfriend Chad, a quarterback, blonde, tall , nothing in his brain and full of muscles.<br />
He had no choice but to accept. It was all set up...Kyle entered the water and felt curiously comfortable. He swum the lake&#39;s water just to release some stress, the girls were wiating in the other side of the lake. After a while Kyle got bored and waited sitting on a rock. A fly passed near him, the buzzing got his attention and his eyes immediately locked the insect. His stomach told him to it, and he felt that primitive instinct to shoot his tongue and catch that fly. But he couldn&#39;t, he had to ressit...like a cat bobbing his head around looking at a piece of skill being twirled in fornt of him. He didn&#39;t want to but his tongue caugth that fly in mid-air and brougth it to Kyle&#39;s mouth where he crunched it and ate it. Wherever Sam and Becca were, they were laughing right now seeing him do that. Finnally the car came, Kyle jumped to the water and saw Brian&#39;s car parking between the trees one meter form the lake&#39;s water. Kyle swum to the shore and waited between the rocks annd leaves  form the trees that floated. He waited, and waited until they were deep involved in their love making. Kyle could hear Rebecca and Sam in his mind yelling for him to avance. Kyle did so, he positioned his frog legs and with one jump he got out of the car and landed on the car&#39;s bonnet. Brian and the bimbo screamed as they saw him. Kyle growled fro some reason. The girl was the first to open the door and hysterically ran to the woods, Brian didn&#39;t care much for her. He got out of the car equally scared but his ego made him stand there.<br />
&quot;What the hell are you, hun? Are you the swamp thing?&quot; <br />
Kyle growled again and stood up looking more menacing.<br />
&quot;Get down of there and fight me like a man!&quot; Brian said and stripped down his jacket. Kyle did not want to fight Brian as he knew he&#39;d loose. But Rebecca and Sam wanted him to scare Brian away, and what was happening was the other way around, Kyle was the one who wanted to flee that scene. Brian pulled one of his legsand Kyle fell on the car&#39;s bonnet and sled to the ground when he got up in a frog like postion Brian stopped and looked at him.<br />
&quot;Kyle? From high school?&quot;<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t certainly say yes. Instinctively he shot his tongue that hit Brian in the face like a punch, the jock stumbled back and Kyle took the chance to leap landing on his chest and taking him down. Brian fought back but Kyle managed to stop his arms under his big webbed hands, he almost forget he too had muscles now. Not knowing what to do, and seeing that Brian was now sure that it was Kyle he licked his face, leaving him full of drool and mucous liquid. Brian closed his eyes and babbled around. Kyle jumped out of him and waited to see what his opponent was going to do, luckily Brian cleaned his face and got up in hurry efore running through the woods searching for his bimbo.<br />
<br />
Kyle jumped back in the water and swum to the other side. Becca and Sam were there waiting for him with a camera phone, both girls were laughing.<br />
&quot;That was great! It went better than I thougth! We recorded it all, thank heavens there&#39;s zoom in.&quot;<br />
Kyle got inside the car and waited for the girls to stop laughing. It took them a couple of minutes, they got inside too and drove back to their home.Kyle leapt trough their yard quickly afraid that any of Sam&#39;s neighbours would see him. Inside the house, back in his room the girls were watching happily watching the video once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so I did what you wanted. Now transform me back, please&quot; Kyle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we don&#39;t?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you promised me. C&#39;mon, Brian even reckognized me, he knows what I&#39;ve become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your problem&quot; Becca answered. &quot;We&#39;re not guilty you make such a good frog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a frog!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apart from your assault on Brian, we also recorded this...&quot; Sam showed Kyle the phone. The video was playing a part where Kyle caugth a fly with his tongue. &quot;I disagree, I think you do want to be a frog. In fact I believe we only did you a favour turning you in what you always were inside you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I din&#39;t want to do it. I was hungry and it was stronger than me&quot; Kyle fought back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, dear Kyle. It was stronger than you, becaus eit came from inside you. Just admit it deep down you love your new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle had no words against them!<br />
<br />
&quot;A deal is a deal, I did my part now do yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam and Becca then...</p>
