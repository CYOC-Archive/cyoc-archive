<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria stared at the app as it opened. She was eager, more eager than she&#39;d ever been for anything in her life. As it loaded up, a large red “test” button popped up on the screen, with the following text below it: “For optimal operations, it is recommended that users test the app before any modifications of transformation(s) are performed.”<br />
<br />
Figuring that discretion was the better part of valor (particularly where her ultimate fantasy was concerned) Gloria tapped the button. More text appeared: “If operations are normal, you will feel another warmth internally as the nanites switch to active mode to receive instruction. Do not panic, this is normal and will subside momentarily.” A countdown timer appeared, counting down from five, and when it reached zero, as expected, she felt a full body warmth. More text appeared. “All systems functioning normally.”<br />
<br />
The screen blipped for a moment, then a silhouette of her body came onscreen. Bright green text highlighted several factors (complete with helpful arrows)<br />
<br />
STANDARD FORM:<br />
<br />
Sex: Female<br />
Age: 31<br />
Breast Size: 32CC<br />
Hair: Black<br />
Eyes: Ice Blue<br />
Height: 5 Feet, 7 Inches<br />
Weight: 135 Lbs.<br />
Muscle Density: Low-Moderate<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian-Hispanic mix<br />
<br />
Two tabs below said “confirm” and “modify”. While the allure of testing out something minor, like changing her eye color was definitely real, Gloria didn&#39;t want to dampen any of the sensations of her first time by feeling something small. Though she couldn&#39;t help but think what fun she might be able to have by altering her appearance. Instead, she tapped the “confirm” button, which took her to a new screen with more text:<br />
<br />
TRANSFORM TO:<br />
<br />
SPECIES: <br />
<br />
As she tapped the blank next to the species label, her phone&#39;s keypad came up. This gave Gloria some pause. What would be her first transformation? <br />
<br />
Scrolling through the categories of animal available to her, Gloria took in the enormous number of options. How could anyone decide?<br />
<br />
“Ugh,” Gloria sighed, “It’s like picking courses all over again.” Still, reminiscing about her school days did give her an idea or two. She had been a bit of an athlete when she was younger, and what better way to relive that than looking for one of her old school mascots? <br />
<br />
“College,” she thought for a moment. “No, not what I’m looking for; and junior high wasn’t an animal.” It looked like high school was going to be her best bet for inspiration.<br />
<br />
Sliding through the list, Gloria’s eyes eventually settled on Feline. Yes, this would do nicely. Tapping the menu, she read down the list until she saw just the feline she was looking for. Hovering her finger over the option, she allowed herself a slight grin at the thought of high school volleyball and days gone by. “Good old Panthers,” she said quietly, “Hard to think that was fifteen years ago.”<br />
<br />
Tapping panther brought up a second sub-tab, letting her pick from bipedal and quadrupedal forms. She quickly picked bipedal, and found herself getting somehow more aroused at the thought of such feline grace being in the palm of her hand. Her panties were soaking in anticipation.<br />
<br />
A quick bar of text informed her that she&#39;d picked a “standard transformation subroutine” and “no additional nanites required”.<br />
<br />
FUR COLOR/DENSITY:<br />
She saw that she could actually have given herself fanciful colors, like hot pink or lime green, but instead stuck with black. The density options ranged from none to ultra-thick, but she chose standard. A hairless panther seemed rather silly and unappealing to her, while the tropical climate made having an ultra-thick fur coat seem rather uncomfortable as well.<br />
<br />
EYE COLOR: <br />
Instead of simply letting her pick a basic color, this resulted in a color wheel pop-up, where she found a stunningly bright yellow with hints of green.<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMED HEIGHT: <br />
Gloria was amused that she could actually become smaller, but instead chose add on a few inches, bringing her height to 6’1”.<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMED WEIGHT: <br />
She put 185 Lbs. Gloria wanted a certain amount of muscle mass, but also wanted to be feminine. Besides, part of the allure of the feline form was in its elegance and agility, not sheer strength.<br />
<br />
BREAST SIZE (primary): <br />
She did, however, like the idea of her boobs getting larger, and so she decided 36D would do just nicely. While she wasn&#39;t averse to the idea of not having proper breasts, Gloria felt the need to declare her femininity on her first change.<br />
<br />
BREAST SIZE (complementary) : <br />
Ah yes, the teats. She could pick from none, to &#39;teats only&#39;, all the way up to 36D (as the new breasts couldn&#39;t be larger than her primary set). She picked none for the moment, as while she liked the idea of them, she didn&#39;t want to look too outlandishly oversexed on the first go.<br />
<br />
KEEP TORSO/HIP/LEG/ARM RATIO CONSISTENT WITH STANDARD MEASUREMENTS? <br />
She clicked yes, not wanting to be out of proportion overall. Being busty was one thing, but having hilariously short legs or arms, or abnormally wide or narrow hips would be moderately annoying, and possibly distracting if she tried to hook up with someone.<br />
<br />
PLEASURE-PAIN RATIO: <br />
This was a simple slider, with pleasure at the left, and pain at the right. It didn&#39;t even take a moment&#39;s consideration for her to slide it fully to the left. While Gloria didn&#39;t mind pain, she certainly wasn&#39;t going to let it happen on her first time.<br />
<br />
GENITAL SENSITIVITY: <br />
She wondered if this applied only during the change, or only after the transformation in her panther form, or some combination of the two. “Only one way to find out,” she said to herself quietly. It didn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what the popular options were, as the lowest setting was “dulled”, then “normal” all the way up to “ultra-heightened”. While Gloria was intrigued at just how explosive her orgasm might be with the setting at the highest level, she decided to just let it be normal for now.<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION ONSET CAUSED BY: <br />
This was another drop-down menu, featuring a wide array of options, from app-activation (presumably meaning using the phone to authorize it), to penetration, to stimulation, to beverage (specify) or light levels, or even “spoken word(s)” (self) and “spoken word(s)” (outside party). Just seeing all the different ways she could make herself transform kept her juices flowing. She couldn&#39;t help but rub the heel of her hand against the crotch of her jeans as her arousal surged along with her imagination. Even more intriguing was the “other” (please type keyword) implying that the program had the ability to figure out what you wanted, or could somehow facilitate it.<br />
<br />
DURATION IN TRANSFORMED SHAPE BEFORE REVERSION: <br />
She had the option of setting a number of minutes, or she could leave it at “until reversion triggered” or even “both”. She decided to give it a duration of fifteen minutes, as well as “until reversion triggered”. She wasn&#39;t sure what she might feel like doing after she&#39;d changed, but she figured she&#39;d play it safe. She could always alter things the second time around.<br />
<br />
REVERSION TO STANDARD SHAPE TRIGGERED BY: <br />
It was an identical menu to the “onset caused by” option she&#39;d encountered earlier, and she paused, then grinned. Selecting “orgasm/climax” seemed a good choice. She was already thinking about herself in her sexual feline form, and knew that she&#39;d likely explore her body. <br />
<br />
CONFIRM: ?<br />
<br />
Gloria tapped the confirm button, and it took her to a quick overview of what her current transformation was set at. She double checked her options and then tapped “next”.<br />
<br />
The screen was black, aside from the “Transformation Resort” header and the words “Transformation Onset in:” She tapped the button, bringing up a timer. She almost had set it for a ten second countdown, but then decided against it for a moment.<br />
<br />
She went to the dresser and retrieved her laptop off the top of it. It was silly, really, that she&#39;d bring it with her, but she&#39;d grown so accustomed to bringing it with her everywhere that she practically felt naked without it. It was essentially an extension of herself at this point, as far as her career and personal life went. She powered it on and checked the battery life, then once she&#39;d confirmed it had enough juice, she set it up beside her on the bed, turning on the built-in webcam and setting it to record. She angled the screen so she could get a nice view of herself without the distortion and oddities that came from viewing a flatscreen at an odd angle, then shimmied out of her pants and shirt and unhooked her bra. Her panties were visibly soaked, the crotch of the light blue satin considerably darker, and she slipped them off as well, making sure to get a good shot of her clean-shaven and slick mound.<br />
<br />
“Hey there, sexy,” she said breathily to the camera, “I&#39;ve got something to show you that you are really gonna like.” She reached over with her free hand and tapped “countdown start” after setting it for ten seconds. If anyone else saw the video it would seem she was talking to them, but the reality is that she was talking to herself. The transformation fantasy wasn&#39;t complete if she couldn&#39;t see herself changing; experiencing it was only half the total package. She was going to get more than a few souvenirs out of this incredible place. <br />
<br />
The last three seconds were the longest of her life, almost emphasized by the beeping phone. Beep..beep...beep...BEEEEEEEEP. At the zero mark, the phone let out a longer beep to let her know the transformation was going to start and...</p>
