<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I've always liked red cars, and Muscle Cars look really cool, so I should become a Red Muscle Car.&quot; thought Ryan. He turned to Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to become a Red Muscle Car.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; said Jeremy. &quot;And, I can drive you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's just one thing.&quot; said Jeremy. &quot;Where are you going to find a red muscle car to become?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan remembered that one of the people who lived on their street had recently bought a muscle car, that was, conveniently, red. Ryan and Jeremy came up with a plan. Ryan would wait until the neighbor was washing the car, then touch it, and run over into Ryan and Jeremy's Garage, where he would change into the car. Jeremy could drive him for 2 hours before he would change Ryan back.<br />
<br />
The twin brothers waited an hour until the neighbor began to wash the car. Ryan walked over to the neighbor's driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that sure is a nice car.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; said the Neighbor. &quot;It's funny, everyone says that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can't imagine why.&quot; said Ryan. He looked at his watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops.&quot; said Ryan. &quot;I've got to go.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Ryan ran off, he patted the car. He felt the familiar tingling feeling, and ran into his garage. Jeremy hit the door-opener button and turned the lights on so he'd be able to watch his twin brother transforming into his new ride.<br />
<br />
As the garage door closed, Ryan felt the tingling feeling get stronger. The transformation was about to begin.<br />
<br />
Ryan first felt his hair shriveling up and sucking into his head. His armpit hair, chest hair, leg hair and pubic hair did the same. Ryan quickly stripped naked and threw his clothes off to the side of the garage. Ryan got down on his hands and knees. Jeremy watched in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Ryan noticed that his shoulders were expanding, getting wider. His shoulders were also growing, gaining muscle. His torso also expanded, layers upon layers of muscle being added to Ryan. He was growing, fast. Soon he was twice as large as he was before. Then, Ryan's legs started to shrink into his body. His knees melted into his changing form. His legs were now only an inch in length. His feet remained unchanged. Next, Ryan's arms did the same, shrinking into his body until his arms were only an inch in length each, but still his hands remained unaltered.<br />
<br />
Ryan next felt his legs reforming, becoming one appendage, and he noticed his arms were doing the same. His feet and hands remained seperate. Ryan's neck shrunk into his body, until his head and torso were one. Ryan could no longer move his head, as the sides of his head stretched, attaching to his shoulders. Ryan's nose melted away, and it's former spot smoothed out. Jeremy watched, and felt himself getting an erection watching his twin brother transforming into a muscle car.<br />
<br />
Ryan felt an odd feeling in his ass. His buttocks suddenly grew, stretching outwards, taking the lower half of is body with it. His butt stretched out on both sides, and what was left of his butt cheeks changed into headlights. Ryan was lost in a state of sexual bliss. He felt adrenaline throughout his entire body. <br />
<br />
Ryan's hips stretched out and expanded, joining the lower part of his body, which was now more car than human. Ryan's chest flexed as his nipples darkened until they were grey. His nipples opened up, and grew wider and wider. Ryan's nipples suddenly burst out from his body, growing and growing, twisting around his chest, going in and out of his body. His belly button did the same, and Ryan's nipples and belly button became tubing. Ryan's pecs stretched towards the ground a bit, making room for soon-to-come seats.<br />
<br />
Ryan's back suddenly started stretching, contorting and twisting. Ryan's back stretched upwards, forming the cabin. Seats grew out of his shoulder blades, a steering wheel formed out of what had been his neck.<br />
<br />
Ryan was lost in sexual euphoria. He wasn't feeling any pain, and instead, he felt immense pleasure. It was like a continuous orgasm that wasn't ending. Ryan's face bulged out, his mouth widening to form a chrome grill. His eyes stretched apart to opposite sides of his head, forming headlights. The only part of his head that wasn't there was his ears, which had relocated and were stretching into side mirrors.<br />
<br />
Jeremy had a massive erection as he watched Ryan morph into a muscle car. However, Ryan still had hands and feet where his tires should have been. As Jeremy watched in awe, Ryan's feet flexed, then formed tread patterns. Ryan's feet rolled into the shape of tires. Ryan's hands formed fists, which expanded into tires, but did not change color. In fact, Ryan's whole muscle car body was still Ryan's skin tone. Ryan watched as Ryan's skin hardened and became chrome. Ryan's chrome then turned red.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was amazed at his brother's transformation, and was amazed that he had gotten a muscle car. Jeremy opened Ryan's door and sat down in the drivers' seat. Jeremy took a breath and realized that Ryan even smelled like a new car. Jeremy realized that he had no keys to turn Ryan on. Suddenly, Ryan roared to life, still having consciousness, and all five senses. Jeremy smiled and reached for the gear shift. It felt squishy. Jeremy looked down and realized that Ryan's erect penis was the gear shift, and it had not yet transformed. <br />
<br />
Jeremy watched as Ryan's manhood began to stiffen. It then grew larger and larger. Ryan's shaft straightened and turned to polished metal. The head of Ryan's penis expanded until it was a perfect sphere, then became metal. Ryan's testicles expanded, and formed the rest of the gear shift. Jeremy put Ryan into ignition, then pressed the button on the garage-door opener, revealing Jeremy's new car, Ryan, to the world.</p>
