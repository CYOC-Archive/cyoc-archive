<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I decided to play it by ear, as they say. I didn&#39;t need to say or do anything, Ian was my best friend, we&#39;d know each other since we were 4! We played on the same teams at school, hung out 3 to 4 times a week. I was even privy to his tales of the girls he&#39;d been dating, hearing about how they would moan when he bedded them, how he was so big. I used to love hearing about it, imagining it was me. Wait I mean no, not with Ian, I mean, well maybe... I was getting things so confused since my conversion last night.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we were planning on playing games, having some food, hanging and doing bro stuff. We&#39;d planned it since my parents announced they&#39;d be away.<br />
<br />
I finished making Chris his pancakes, adding in some bacon fat into them, needed to keep his energy levels up. I think my natural small-dick tendancies were making decisions for me, which I was kind of fine with. As I dished up I felt good about myself for the first time in a long time. No hiding what I was, no pretending, and the three loads I&#39;d taken today, two orally, one anally (my first time, with my little brother taking my cherry no less!) were so satisfying I didn&#39;t want to go back. Not only that but I was genuinely considering switching to the small-dick cum diet! I felt wonderful on it so far, and with my brother and Mr Jenkins on tap... I could even make sure George gets his cock... I daydreamed about his cock for a moment, remembering the taste of his cum. My mouth watering. Mmm yes George is gonna be a source for me, definitely.<br />
<br />
How things change in less than 24 hours!<br />
<br />
Chris was devouring his pancakes, a muffled thanks and a few mmm&#39;s through the mouthfuls. I stood at the window washing up and spotted Mr. Jenkins outside talking to Mrs. Forbes from accross the road. He spotted me and waved. I waved back smiling happily. Mrs Forbes waved back too. I carried on washing up, when I looked up again Mr. Jenkins was waving again? Was he waving me over?<br />
<br />
I had finished and was drying my hands up. I bounded out the side door and jogged over to him. &quot;Morning again Mr. Jenkins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning again little bitty one. I was just telling Janey here about you.&quot; I looked at the bespeckled lady in her 50s smiling expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, I hear you&#39;re a small-dick! Wonderful news, the road has been so quiet without one since the last moved away to the big city. I hear you kept our Nathaniel here happy.&quot; Nathaniel! That was his name, I just knew him as Mr. Jenkins!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, yes, thank you. I must say I.... well I loved it if I&#39;m honest, I wish I&#39;d had my conversion a long time ago. Missed out on so much.&quot; I looked down and Mr. Jenkins huge bulge again hungrily. Really, I thought, again?! Well I mean it did taste so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;You OK there little one, you need another load?&quot; Mr. Jenkins asked following my eye line and patting his mountainious crotch.<br />
<br />
I nodded guiltily.<br />
<br />
They both laughed. &quot;Well then have at it dicklet. Anyway Janey I was saying, they really need to speak to the housing association about...&quot;<br />
<br />
I knelt before my favourite neighbour for the second time this morning and began to unhook the support buttons holding his huge cock restrained. Thank god large-dick men didn&#39;t lose their virility with age like women tended to. Fishing out the python of a cock I began kissing the shaft down to the head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes&quot; Mrs Forbes continued, &quot;I mean the garden decorations are a little... well he is a respectful short-dick isn&#39;t he?&quot; She nodded down to me. Mr Jenkins stroked my cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;No training whatsover.&quot; He assured her with a kindly smile. &quot;I must compliment Ben and Debra when they get back for what a sterling young man.... ooh yes boy, get underthere with your tongue again... what a sterling young man they&#39;ve raised.&quot; I was truly worshipping, what was so far my favourite cock. At least to suck, Chris was my only anal large-dick provider, so he won there definitely.<br />
<br />
I hummed happily, partly enjoying myself, partly as I knew how to tame this monster now and get to that sweet old nectar. I heard him moan deeply, gruffly. He gripped my hair in one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I see that, very impressive young man. Oh my Brian is back for a visit this month, I&#39;ll send him over, he&#39;s a very good large-dick I&#39;m told. I mean I&#39;m his mother I&#39;m no doubt bias&quot; She laughed, unconsciously pimping me out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm dicklet that&#39;s it, deep and slow, I love that. Absolutely Janey, tell Brian it&#39;s recommended by his old pal Nate. He&#39;ll be very pleased when he... when he.... oh good boy.... that&#39;s it, swallow it all.... when he does.&quot; I swallowed every drop again, god it was like liquid heaven to me. I know women hate the smell and taste of it, and large-dicks, even the gay ones, are not exactly fans, but us small-dicks fucking love this stuff!<br />
<br />
&quot;I will anyway, must get back, my soap is on.&quot; Mrs Forbes waved at us, we waved back as I felt the pillar of flesh slowly pull out of my throat, Mr Jenkins, stood with his cock still partially down my throat, me kneeling and looking towards her with side eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as good little dicklet aren&#39;t you boy.&quot; Mr Jenkins said as his dick audibly slapped against his knees. I came under the praise, my dark jeans showing a rather small but growing wet patch. Mr Jenkins chuckled and turned back to his home. I got up and returned to mine. Looking at my phone on the way I saw Ian was due to be dropped off in less than an hour. I needed to shower and change. Again!<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The door rang and I rushed down to open it. I wasn&#39;t wearing the falsie and it was freeing! I opened the door and hugged Ian hello. He hugged back. I felt his bulge press against my lack of one. He didn&#39;t seem to notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in dude!&quot; I cheered, he entered and I shut the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dan, good to finally hang out, it&#39;s been too long!&quot; Ian replied. Ian&#39;s family was originally from Japan, they were very proud of him as he was what you&#39;d call a jock. He was taller than me at 6&#39;4&quot;, more muscular, he had raven black hair, almond-shaped eyes, a really warm and open smile. Everyone loved Ian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yea I got that new Tekken the other day&quot; I said taking his bag and coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, chill I just got here, you got any water?&quot; He looked round the place, probably checking my parents were really away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit yea, come through.&quot; We headed to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your little bro here?&quot; Ian asked still looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, Chris is upstairs I think why?&quot; I got him a water from the fridge, cracking the bottle top open before handing it to him<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sucks you got babysit the little shit is all!&quot; Ian laughed, it was good hearted banter, nothing to read into. Ian was rarely cryptic or mean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah he&#39;s OK, he&#39;s a good si... he&#39;s good.&quot; I caught myself, just.<br />
<br />
I was stood on the other side of the breakfast counter so I knew Ian couldn&#39;t see what... I lacked. But annoyingly I couldn&#39;t see what he was packing, which bothered me more than it should.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....&quot; Ian offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; I countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the plan dude?&quot; Ian clapped his hands at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I thought gaming, takeaway, hanging, usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you have the whole house to yourself! You don&#39;t wanna party?&quot; Ian grinned cheekily at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Party? Oh no, my folks would kill me, and Chris is great, as I said, but he would totally rat us out.&quot; I hoped Ian would get the clue I didn&#39;t want a party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... OK&quot; Ian said sitting down at the stool on the other side of the bar. &quot;Oh yea, I forgot!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Ian expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know...&quot; he produced his phone, turning it to face me. &quot;That you&#39;re bro and I exchanged numbers ages ago, when we were at that away game? He messaged me this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
My face drained of all colour. &quot;Wha...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, he messaged me this morning. Told me to bring my A game for you. I asked what he meant.&quot; Ian had positioned himself high up on the stool at the bar. High enough to look over at my non-existent crotch bulge. &quot;And I see from here, dude you been holding out on me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck I was busted!</p>
