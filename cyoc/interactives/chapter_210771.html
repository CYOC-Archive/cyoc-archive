<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Heather next regained consciousness it was dark and silent. She looked around blearily and tried to figure out exactly what time it was. Her alarm clock had disappeared with the rest of her teen belongings. She carefully rolled onto her hands and knees and looked out through the bars. The room was a bit lighter than it should be. She saw the source, a nightlight in the corner. It was dim enough to not disturb anyone sleeping, but bright enough that she could see the booklet still sitting in the middle of the floor, just out of reach.<br />
<br />
Heather examined the crib bars carefully. If she really was a baby then she would have never been able to get them open and escape, but she still had her teen mind and the mechanism was a simple one. Careful not to make any noise she lifted the bars up and let them back down slowly past the catch. She was free. Not trusting her ability to stand at the moment she slid to the floor and crawled to the booklet with only the slightest rustle from her diaper.<br />
<br />
The booklet was exactly like the ones that came with any modern electronics. A small bundle of folded papers held together with a couple of staples in the fold. She squinted at it. There was definitely writing but the light was too dim here to make it out. She crawled over to the nightlight and tried again there. The dim light was more than enough to make out the words printed on the outside of the booklet.<br />

Quick Start Guide<br />
<br />
Heather turned to the first page. It had a bunch of useless copyright information printed too small for her to read in this light. The next page was more informative, as was the next, and the next.<br />
<br />
Thank you for purchasing the BIG TOTS brand play system. Pleas be sure to read the warnings and instructions on our website available through the QR code on the back of this book before you begin play.<br />
<br />
Step 1<br />
Strip naked and apply one of the BIG TOTS brand diapers in the usual manner.<br />
<br />
Step 2<br />
Once applied you will have a few moments to select a totem. Please see the guide on our website for totem recommendations. If a totem is not selected then an appropriate one will be selected from the surrounding environment.<br />
<br />
Step 3<br />
After selecting your totem you must select a scenario. See our website for a full list of pre-built scenarios and instructions on how to make your own. If a scenario is not selected then one of the defaults will be chosen based on the user&#39;s temperament.<br />
<br />
Step 4<br />
Stand by while the chosen scenario is activated. We recommend sitting down during this process.<br />
<br />
Step 5<br />
Enjoy your playtime! When you are ready to end play, use the totem to close out the scenario.<br />
<br />
&quot;A totem.&quot; Heather whispered to herself. She looked over at the toy chest. Her panties. That must be the totem. She continued reading.<br />
<br />
FAQ<br />
Q: How do I choose a totem?<br />
A: Simply hold your chosen totem in your hand after applying the BIG TOTS diaper.<br />
<br />
Q: A friend/family member is behaving oddly during the scenario, is this normal?<br />
A: BIG TOTS cannot fully predict the effects of our system on non-users. If you are experiencing difficulties then please contact us on our website.<br />
<br />
Q: After ending the scenario some things did not return to normal, how do I fix this?<br />
A: Sometimes artifacts of scenarios will linger after completion. They should be unnoticeable to non-users and will fade with time. If an artifact hasn&#39;t faded after a week please contact us on our website.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I use the totem to end the scenario?<br />
A: Simply hold it in your hand and think &#39;end scenario.&#39;<br />
<br />
Q: Can I bring friends into a scenario?<br />
A: BIG TOTS recommends that you do not try to bring others into a scenario. The BIG TOTS brand play system was engineered for solo play. We are currently testing a multiplayer system, see our website for details.<br />

Heather flipped to the last page. It had a QR code on it. Presumably to access the website. She would do that later, when she had her phone back. For now she had a new mission: her panties. She crawled carefully over to the toy box and opened the lid. The toys in the bath might have passed for kids toys on some level, but half the ones in here were unmistakably made for adults. She saw dildos and vibrators in all shapes and sizes, leather collars and restraints, even a large wooden paddle. The other half of the toys were just normal baby toys: dollies, plastic keys, a speak-and-spell. Heather gaped at the oddly mixed contents for a few minutes before finding her prize. Her panties had slid down in between a pacifier-shaped gag and what was unmistakably a butt-plug. She held her breath and delicately plucked the white cotton out without touching the other contents of the box.<br />
<br />
She took several deep breaths to steady herself. This had better work. Closing her eyes, she clasped the panties in both hands and thought &#39;end scenario&#39; with all of her might. For a brief moment she panicked. It wasn&#39;t working. Then the room began spinning and Heather found herself caught up in a whirlwind. After several minutes of being buffeted by unseen wind and spun around like a top Heather found herself sitting in her room again. Her normal room. Everything was exactly as she had left it. She looked up at the desk that come back into being next to her and saw both her phone and laptop sitting right where they belonged. She grabbed her phone and checked the time. It was 2 AM. She sighed in relief and went to stand up. She was still wearing the diaper.<br />
<br />
Heather gaped down at herself. The footed pajamas had vanished in the whirlwind with the rest of the baby furniture, but the diaper was still wrapped around her hips. No wait, it wasn&#39;t the same diaper. She looked closer. It was the diaper she had first put on that morning, the one that had started the changes, not the giant one that made her crawl. She poked at it cautiously. It was dry. She sighed in relief. She looked over at the bed and saw the open box still sitting there next to the clothes she had bought.<br />
<br />
&#39;These diapers made all that happen.&#39; she thought.<br />
<br />
She looked at the booklet still in her hand. The QR code stared back at her. She unlocked her phone and opened the camera. When she scanned the code it opened her browser and pulled up a webpage. She sat down on her bed and began reading. The website was very informative. Though it was very vague on exactly how the system worked it was very straightforward on what could be done with it. Heather browsed through the scenario descriptions, making a note to look closer at a few of them. At the top of the list were the three default scenarios: Sexy Babe, Baby Days, and Best of Both Worlds.<br />
<br />
Baby Days was described as a true baby experience. Everyone would treat you as a baby until you ended the scenario. This included feeding, bathing, and diapering. The site recommended this scenario for beginners who just wanted to relax. Sexy Babe read like a badly written porno, it was clearly made for people who got off on wearing diapers and being babied. In that scenario people would treat you as an adult, but with diapers,  humiliation, and sex. Heather had to stop reading the description when it got to scat play. The third scenario was the one she assumed she had gotten, Best of Both Worlds. In this one you would be yourself, only diapered. If you wanted you could act like a baby and people would just roll with it, or you could act more normal and not much would be different aside from the diapers. It didn&#39;t mention anything about sex though. She scanned down the rest of the scenarios, then decided to come back to them later.<br />
<br />
She clicked through to the pages about totems. The site recommended that you use something difficult to lose track of, like a bracelet, as your totem. It ultimately didn&#39;t matter what you chose because the totem could not be damaged or destroyed and would always find its way back to you if lost. Non-users would only see the totem as a toy if they even noticed it at all and would have no real interest in keeping you from it. Heather looked down at the panties she had dropped on the floor. She would pick a better totem for next time.<br />
<br />
Wait. Next time?<br />
<br />
Heather was shocked at the thought. She was seriously considering trying this again now that she knew how to control it. She looked down at the diaper she still hadn&#39;t removed. The butterfly pattern shimmered. Yes, she would try it again. Though she would need to make a few changes. She clicked on the FAQ link and began reading. There were all sorts of odd questions about the various scenarios and how to manipulate them. She quickly found a question that she herself wanted to ask:<br />
<br />
Q: Why do I sometimes get sex-related stuff in non-sexual scenarios?<br />
A: The BIG TOTS system is designed to take the user&#39;s preferences and mix them into the scenario. If you are experiencing sexual content in otherwise non-sexual scenarios then you might be experiencing arousal and the system is adjusting to compensate. If you do not wish to experience any sexual content please select &#39;force non-sexual&#39; in the scenario builder in our app.<br />
<br />
Heather made a note of that and read on. She found another important question a few pages in.<br />
<br />
Q: I am using the Sexy Babe scenario but my girlfriend doesn&#39;t participate. Instead I get some random babysitter from a service and she goes off elsewhere until the scenario ends. How do I fix this?<br />
A: The BIG TOTS system cannot, and will not, force non-users to do anything against their will. If your SO is not participating in the scenario then it means she has no interest in sexual roleplay of this type. We recommend speaking with your SO outside of the scenario to determine what, if anything, they may be comfortable with doing.<br />
<br />
Heather put this new information with the rest. So people would only participate if they wanted to? She thought about Mel. Did this mean that Mel was into her? Or maybe just into caring for her like... that. And the scenario had added sexual themes because it thought that Heather wanted it. She shivered. She did want it, she knew that for sure now, she just wasn&#39;t sure if she was comfortable with her best friend providing it. Was Mel even her best friend anymore? Did this make her something more? Heather decided that she could worry about that later. For now she had a few more questions here that needed answers. She read on.<br />
<br />
Q: How many times can I use a BIG TOTS diaper?<br />
A: BIG TOTS diapers are one-use only, after a scenario ends they become inert padding and only function as a normal diaper.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I play a fantasy scenario like DnD?<br />
A: The basic BIG TOTS system can only work in the framework of standard reality with minor deviations. We are working to develop a more advanced system that can handle fantasy and sci-fi elements but it is still in early testing.<br />
<br />
Q: If me and my friend both put on a BIG TOTS diaper at the same time will we both enter the scenario?<br />
A: DO NOT ATTEMPT TANDEM USE. The basic BIG TOTS system is built for solo use only, attempting to start a tandem scenario will result in severe errors causing one or both users to be stuck in an incomplete scenario. Please contact our service team immediately if you or a loved one have attempted this. If you are interested in tandem play we are currently beta testing our new BIG TOTS double-trouble system, please contact our testing team if you are interested.<br />
<br />
There was a lot more to read, but Heather was growing tired again. She finally decided to download the scenario builder app and take a look at it. It took several minutes to install and when she opened it there were several pages of warnings about the various different settings and how some couldn&#39;t be used while others were active. She read through them carefully the opened the Best of Both Worlds scenario to take a look at it. The settings matched the description on the website and there were various options to adjust the intensity of various elements. Heather poked at them to see what they did but didn&#39;t change anything. She backed out and browsed through several other scenarios that caught her eye.<br />
<br />
Finally she could put off sleep no longer. She pushed the clothing and diaper box off the bed and crawled under the covers. She had completely forgotten the diaper she was wearing, she just wanted to sleep. In moments she was lost to the waking world.</p>
