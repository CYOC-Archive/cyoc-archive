<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the smoke dissipated a curtain came up in front of the boys hiding them from the audience. This curtain also had mirrors so that the boys could watch themselves. <br />
After he heard petunia honk his nose Alfie started to giggle looked at himself he watched as his face starting from his nose turned white as did the rest of his body. His blond hair began to turn an electric blue color to match his eyes as it began to grow more into and Afro. His red astronaut  space suit began to change as well. The top half separated from the bottom and turned light blue with a big yellow bow tie around his neck his now pants became as wide a hula hoop they kept their red color they gained white polka dots. Next his slippers grew to be about size 17 shoes. His feet grown to match that size. Looking back at his face where his eyebrows were gone but had been replaced by thick expressive black lines were in his eyebrows place. This made him giggle as his face stretched into a smile his face gain red make up around his mouth and lips. <br />
<br />
After Jack’s nose was honked he immediately felt his body tingle. Looking at himself in the mirror he watched as his blue space suit got looser he watched as colorful polka dots appeared all over it. Looking back up to his face he saw that his long brown hair came out of the pony tail it was in and turn a bright red his whole body had as white as snow and his face stretched into a smile. His feet also grew to size 17 just like Alfie. He started giggling and jumping all over the place. <br />
<br />
When Sam’s nose was honked his feet imediately grew to size 17 with the black slippers he was wearing extending and turning blue. His green jumpsuit got a lot wider in the middle of it the bottom half turning orange with polka dots and the top half looking more like a shirt with a light blue color. he looked at his face which had turned white like the other boys. He looked at his head. He watched as the hair on top of his head fell out revealing his Snow White scalp. However the hair on the side grew longer and curlier it also turned red like Jack’s. <br />
<br />
Harry’s nose was honked and surprisingly his skin stayed the same mostly. His skin got an orange hue to it except for the areas around his eyes and mouth those turn white. His lips were outlined in a black makeup. His bright yellow jumpsuit much like Alfie’s split up have into a shirt and pants. However his didn’t expand like Alfie’s. His shirt turned into a red checkered pattern with short sleeves. His pants turning bright blue with patch work on them. His hair his arms and legs becoming orange just like his face. His short blond spiked hair gained a green hue to it. The jell falling out as his hair grew longer falling just below his ears. A sailers hat then appeared on his head. His slippers became a pair of large black shoes with big toes. But his feet only seemed to grow to size 14 unlike the rest of the boys.  <br />
<br />
As the smoke dissipated and the curtain dropped the 4 new clown boys posed for the audience who laughed at and applauded  the magic trick the audience thinking that they just swapped the kids out for other kids already dressed up as clowns. Has the clowns portion of the show came to a close Petunia brought the 4 boys backstage again where Alfie reunited with the his parents. His parents who were in shock of what they just saw. Since they were actually able to see what happened. Petunia escorted the group back to the Party room. Alfie and the other clowns taking awhile since they kept tripping over their clown shoes. Arriving back at the room the 4 clown boys stood there with smiles on their faces. Alfie’s mom asking if they would be stuck like this forever? Petunia said oh no they won’t. Walking over she pulled the Clown nose off of Sam’s face. Everyone watched in amazement as his skin turned back to his normal color and the hair on top of his head came back still dyed blond as it was before the change. They couldn’t see it but his feet had returned to their normal size as well. His clown costume however did not change. This was because the jumpsuits from before were specifically made to change into clown costumes for kids at birthday parties. Oh yeah by the way, Petunia went over and grabbed a stack of clothes and handed each boy a pile of clothes. It’s was their clothes that had gotten ruined by the pies. We cleaned them! Petunia told the 4 boys to feel free to go change back to normal and get back into their normal clothes. After they did that she had one more thing for them. Before they leave Petunia summoned one more stack of clothes. They were two more astronaut space suits and slippers, the clown noses on top. This was a birthday present from the circus to Alfie, along with the other boys in case any of them wanted to become clowns again and wanted new costumes. All they had to do was put the clown nose on and squeeze it. She gave each of the boys a bag to take home. It included their clown costumes, the two sets of space suits including the slippers and their clown noses. She said thank you for coming and the group said good bye and made their way out to the car.  Arriving home Alfie’s parents told the boys that it was time for bed, Jack, Sam and Harry staying over for the night as well. The 4 boys were set up in the finished basement in sleeping bags. The 4 boys however couldn’t go to sleep they had been so excited from what had transpired that day. Sam had waited for Alfie’s parents to close the door to the basement. He jumped up and snuck over to his bag from the circus grabbed his clown nose. He hopped back into his sleeping bag and put it on. He felt his body tingle as he put it on. He pulled out his phone to look at himself he saw that his hair was already gone along with his skin which had already turned white. He felt like he kind of enjoyed being a clown so he had decided to just fall asleep like this to see everyone’s reactions in the morning. <br />
<br />
A couple hours later Alfie woke up needing to pee. When he woke up he saw that Sam was in his sleeping bag but he looked like a clown. Coming back down stairs from peeing he grabbed his clown nose and put it on felt his hair grow large he looked at his hands and knew that they were in white like the rest of him. He went over to Sam and woke him up. They both giggled at how they looked. They woke up the other boys. Jack and Harry looked at them and smiled. They both went over a put on their clown noses too. Jack’s hair turned bright red again while Harry turned Green and grew out once more. The 4 boys giggled telling jokes for the next couple hours they eventually fell back asleep. <br />
<br />
The next morning<br />
<br />
Alfie woke up still looking like a clown he woke up the others saying that their parents would be there soon to pick them up. Jack, Sam and Harry took off their clown noses and turned back to normal. After turning back Harry decided to put his clown costume on instead of his regular clothes. Harry walked out of the bathroom looking like his normal self only he was now where king the red checkered short sleeves shirt and tall blue pants and his big black shoes. This made him giggle. Jack and Sam decided to follow suit putting on their jumpsuits. They’re parents arriving at Alfie’s house. They were laughing at what there sims were wearing. They asked what happened. The boys explaining with excitement. However their parents just played it off as kids being kids. Saying buy to his friends Alfie went back down stairs to have some fun.</p>
