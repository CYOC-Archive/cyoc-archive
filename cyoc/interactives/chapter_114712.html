<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a couple hours after lunch and Sheriff Cooper was finishing up giving Darrell and Joan a tour of the police station. Showing Darrell where his deputies take the suspects for their mugshots and fingerprints. Both Joan and Darrell where surprised that fingerprints weren’t taken with ink anymore, but with a digital scanner attached to a computer.<br />
“Much more accurate and extremely detailed,” Douglas Cooper watching Darrell pressing his palms onto to device; “no more messy ink and it cuts down on paper.”<br />
“And I take it,” Joan looking at the computer; “you can compare those prints with the databases with other police departments.”<br />
“Got to love the internet,” Douglas chuckling; “it makes gathering evidence and a profile on a suspect that much more easy.”<br />
“So no more ink Uncle Yogi,” Darrell looking at the sheriff.<br />
<br />
“Well we do have the old ink rollers and papers,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “in case the power goes out and we are on the backup generator. Which by the way,” Sheriff Cooper sighing; “has only enough capacity to run half the lights and our radio communications for a day.”<br />
“You need a bigger gen-set then,” Joan commenting as she guides Darrel out of the room; “that way you can open and close the cell doors.”<br />
“The cell doors are manual,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “you need a key to open them up.”<br />
“What about key card access,” Joan asking; “mag-locks?”<br />
“Nope to both,” Sheriff Cooper chuckling; “this was built before those security features where available. The elder council building has those,” Sheriff Cooper continuing; “but their card reader system has been buggy since it was installed.”<br />
“It’s probably not wired right,” Joan answering; “or a faulty device.”<br />
“Pity you can’t look at it,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “your electrical engineering degree could come in handy.”<br />
“I can look at the plans,” Joan speaking; “see if the single line diagram was drawn right, but I can’t do much more.”<br />
“It’s something to think about,” Douglas thinking.<br />
“Here is something else to think about,” Joan smiling; “spaghetti and meatballs for dinner, or chicken Kiev.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Frederick Parker was standing in a dirt clearing surrounded by tall evergreens; a small depression in the ground lined with rocks letting him know it was a fire pit. The mobster from San Francisco hated camping. Roughing it in the outdoors, it was something he reviled with a passion. Yet after being kicked out of the town’s only motel; an act that he can thank a few of his men who decided to break into Benton Knight’s estate for. Three are dead and the fourth languishing in jail; Frederick would sooner let him rot for what the man did. Frederick did give his men specific instructions not to get into trouble while in town.<br />
<br />
Watching as the men he had pitched some tents they were able to procure; Frederick noticed it was just him and five others. With his assistant looking less than useless without his laptop in hand and fumbling about with the tie downs; Frederick shook his head, glad when the men he called up will be here around midnight.<br />
“Has anyone seen those two nerds with laptops,” Frederick swearing as he had to help his assistant out.<br />
“No boss,” one man comments; “it like they just vanished.”<br />
“Just like Chelnik,” Frederick muttered; “well if they show up, kick there asses before bringing them to me. And if Chelnik puts in and appearance,” Frederick looking at the several texts he sent to his bodyguard; “tell him I need to speak to him immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederick saw several nods form his remaining men as went to one of the rentals to grab a sleeping bag. Claiming the biggest tent for himself as he enters it; Frederick wonders where his men could be. Not knowing that Chelnik was killed by a werewolf hours earlier and that his two techno-nerds were abducted by Leon Talbot&#39;s family; Frederick was wishing he was back in San Francisco eating fresh crab from his favorite restaurant off of Fisherman’s Wharf.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“All right,” one man looking at the terrified men in the back of the van; “the ride is over, this is your stop.”<br />
Opening the door, the two terrified men were dragged out to a view most would find beautiful. Tall trees, a doe grazing in the distance and a clear blue sky.<br />
“Please don’t hurt us,” one of the men begging; seeing one of his captors brandishing a menacing looking hunting knife<br />
<br />
No words were spoken as the man wielding the blade started cutting; terrified screams could be heard yet no blood was spilled. Opening their eyes, the men that were working for Frederick Parker noticed they were completely naked; their clothes cut from their bodies. Unable to cover themselves as some of the men force them to stand up. The techies shiver as there is slight chill in the air.<br />
“We’re not going to kill you,” one man speaking; “we are just kicking you out of town. Your boss and the rest of his men will soon be next.”<br />
“Where are we,” one man asking.<br />
“You are in the ass end of nowhere,” one of the Talbots smirking; “but to show you we are not cruel, thirty miles northwest of here is a border crossing station. Barely manned at time, “ the Talbot chuckling; “but if you manage to make it there despite the thick brush and hilly terrain, then you are free and clear to head back home.”<br />
“Other than that,” the man with the knife removes their bindings; “there is no one else but the bears, wolves and other predators that call these woods home.”<br />
“Good luck,” another Talbot chuckling as he climbs into the van; closing the door and preventing the two naked men from getting back in.”<br />
<br />
They watch as the van drives off; chasing after it futilely as it disappears on the horizon; One man turns to the other.<br />
“So do you know which way North is?”<br />
“Not a clue, I was never in scouts,” the other man speaking; “but it could be worse.”<br />
“How can it be worse,” the first man shivering; his naked body exposed to the air.<br />
“They could of taken our shoes and left us bare foot,” the other looking at their cut up clothes left on the ground.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Leon Talbot smiled as he put his cell phone down; getting a call from his brother updating him that two of Talbots men are now having a naked stroll in the woods near the U.S/Canadian border. Sitting in the kitchen of his house sipping coffee, as he looks at his wife Regina.<br />
“Two down,” was all Leon said.<br />
“If Frederick leaves town,” Regina looking at Leon; “what then?”<br />
“Then we let the police take care of the rest of his men,” Leon answering; “if Eugene hadn’t of objected…”<br />
“Then you would be in handcuffs,” Regina speaking; “you made the right decision in changing the plans.”<br />
“Remember Regina,” Leon looking at his wife; “you wanted this. Frederick Parker is not going to roll over for you.”<br />
“When that paramedic told me how he struggled to save Peter’s life,” Regina looking at her husband; “I couldn’t just let the thought of nearly losing my son go. Since his son is in jail and beyond your reach; then Freddie the Shark will have to pay.”<br />
“I understand,” Leon placing a hand on his wife’s shoulder as he gets up; “but where is Jean?”<br />
<br />
“Jean is over at Nate’s place,” Regina speaking; “after Nate had to leave for work, Jean wanted to plan a little romantic moment with him. So I told her,” Regina getting up; “to head to It’ll Be Our Secret and pick up something fun.”<br />
“The naughty store,” Leon looking at Regina with a curious eye; “it’s been a while since you came back with a little something something from there.”<br />
“I’ve been occupied with family,” Regina seeing the desire in her husband’s eyes; “but I think might still have that little black negligee you love taking off me so much.”<br />
Oooooh,” Leon growls with lust; “I’ll lock up the house, you put the naughty nightie on and I’ll meet you in bed.”</p>
