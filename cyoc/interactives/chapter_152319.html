<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Alex was contemplating the sign he heard voices coming from the clearing back the way he came. He couldn&#39;t make out what they were saying but curiosity got the better of him and he decided to creep closer. He got back to where the wolves had been fucking but they were both gone, instead there were two guys sitting in the clearance, one firmly planted in the other&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
They looked like they could have been brothers. The one sitting on the ground was the bigger of the two, heavily muscled, the one sitting in his lap was still muscular but much more lean. Both had the same silver colored hair, not just on their heads, but ample body hair as well. In fact on their chests it was thick enough you could almost call it fur, and they had the nicely tanned skin of individuals who spent a good deal of time outside. Then Alex noticed other, not quite human things about them. Both of them had ears that came to slight points and yellow eyes, they also both had wolf tails. He couldn&#39;t see the larger guys cock, as it looked firmly planted up the ass of the leaner guy, but the leaner guy&#39;s rock hard cock was definitely not human. It looked like a wolf cock, and if Alex wasn&#39;t mistaken, it was coming from a silver-furred sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, Roc. Now we have to sit out here until your cock goes down.&quot; The leaner one was grumbling. As his lips parted, Alex noticed that he had rather noticeable fangs as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Raf.&quot; That came from the bigger of the two in a deep bass rumble. &quot;It should be down in a couple minutes.&quot; He did sound genuinely apologetic.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the leaner one, Raf&#39;s ears twitched and he sniffed at the air. &quot;That human you were taunting with your ass is back.&quot; Alex ducked low, hoping to hide himself a bit better behind the bush he was using to conceal himself. &quot;You can come on out, human, we won&#39;t hurt you. We couldn&#39;t even chase you down right now if we wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding to take a chance, Alex stood up and entered the clearing, and both pairs of yellow eyes fixed on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of scrawny.&quot; Roc said in a rumbling tone to Raf that was probably meant to be a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s rude. Forgive my big brother. He talks without thinking. He does a lot of things without thinking. It&#39;s not his strong suit. I&#39;m Raf, the big lug is Roc.&quot; Raf certainly seemed cheerful. &quot;Don&#39;t see many humans in this part of the woods, especially not without pants on, and especially not at night. Don&#39;t you know there&#39;s werewolves in these woods?&quot; He laughed at his own words.<br />
<br />
Alex looked around. &quot;Actually, I don&#39;t know how I got here and I&#39;m not even sure where here is.&quot; Though Alex was suddenly aware that he was very naked, and shifted the way he was standing to try to his his own cock, which was still hard from staring t the pair of former wolves. &quot;Werewolves? Like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like us.&quot; Roc said with a nod. &quot;I think you can get off me, now, Raf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raf nodded and stood up, stretching out. &quot;So, naked human out all alone in the woods with no idea how he got here? Lucky you ran into us.&quot; Raf put his hands on his hips as he looked Alex up and down. Behind him Roc was getting to his feet, at least a head taller than his brother. &quot;We can give you a place to crash tonight, then get you on your way to Dicktin Village tomorrow, that&#39;s the closest human settlement.&quot; Raf turns and waved Alex to follow. &quot;C&#39;mon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roc smiled at Alex. &quot;We don&#39;t bite. Unless you&#39;re into that.&quot; Once again, curiosity got the better of Alex and he found himself trailing after these two brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, where am I?&quot; Alex worked up the courage to ask as he caught up with the pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prickin Nole Forest.&quot; Roc said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But uh, beyond that. I&#39;ve never heard of that forest. Or Dicktin Village.&quot; Alex looked at his feet when Raf gave him another curious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to tell you beyond that. Why don&#39;t you tell us where you&#39;re from, maybe we know where it is. We&#39;ve traveled quite a bit.&quot; Raf&#39;s tail wagged a little as he fixed Alex with a smile. <br />
<br />
But Alex telling Raf the name of his hometown only got a vague shake of the head, nor did the name of his home country. &quot;I mean, are we even on Earth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth.. like the ground?&quot; Roc said, tilting his head to the side in a very canine way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth is the name of my world.&quot; Alex said, though it brought a laugh from Roc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your world is called Earth? Might as well call a world Dirt.&quot; He smiled a fangy smile to Alex as his joke.<br />
<br />
Raf was sniffing at the air, squint at Alex. &quot;Well, you&#39;re not lying. Humans have this funny smell to them when they&#39;re lying. So you came from another world. I&#39;ve heard of it happening but I&#39;ve never run into one before. This is beyond what we can help with, but I have a few ideas if you&#39;re set on trying to get back. We can talk about that later, though, we&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked around, he had been expecting some cabin in the woods, but Raf was pointing at a cave with a flap of hide covering the entrance. He slipped inside, followed by Roc. Finally, Alex followed after. He was genuinely surprised by the interior. A large firepit took up the center, and Roc was stirring the smoldering coals it held back to life. There were pillows and blankets strewn around for laying or sitting on. There was even a book case filled with books, and a whole corner dedicated to a pantry. It was cozily homey. There was also a smell, musky, like a wild animal den, but it wasn&#39;t an unpleasant smell, it was rich and earthy, and the scent of it had Alex&#39;s cock stirring.<br />
<br />
Alex took a seat and soon found a plate of sliced fruit and dried meat being placed in his hands by Raf who took a seat next to him. His stomach rumbled at the sight of the food and he started chowing down.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you two are werewolves?&quot; Alex asked between bites of food. &quot;And brothers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And well, no. We&#39;re werewolves, but we&#39;re brothers in so much that we&#39;re packmates. All the wolves in our pack are our brothers. So we&#39;re brothers. But Roc and I are also mates.&quot; Raf watched Alex eat, and Alex had the uneasy feeling he was being sized up as a possible meal, himself. But this close he could see differences in the faces of Raf and Roc.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sisters?&quot; Alex knew he had said something weird when the both looked at him.<br />
<br />
Roc was the one to speak up though. &quot;I don&#39;t know that word.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls? Females?&quot; Those words also got a shake of the head from the two werewolves. Alex blinked a few times, trying to figure out how to explain. &quot;They&#39;re.. well.. They don&#39;t have penises, instead they have breasts.&quot; Alex tried demonstrating breast by cupping his hands in front of his chest but that was met by a laugh from Roc.<br />
<br />
Raf seemed more curious. &quot;No, we don&#39;t have a race like that on this world. I think I&#39;d like to see this Earth of yours. It sounds strange. No penises? Very strange.&quot; Alex&#39;s brain was swirling with questions. Did he seriously end up on a world populated solely by males? There was logistics to that he just couldn&#39;t wrap his head around, but decided he didn&#39;t want to go down that rabbit hole at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Raf continued, &quot;You&#39;ll want to head to Dicktin Village, we have a friend there that might be able to get you to someone who can help you get back to your world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Elves are good with magic.&quot; Roc said as he took his own seat next to the fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess you could go to the Elves, too, but they don&#39;t usually like random humans walking into their part of the forest.&quot; Raf rubbed at his stubbly jaw. &quot;We&#39;ll only be able to walk you part way tomorrow. It&#39;s a full moon tomorrow night which means the pack is getting together, our Alpha will be pissed if we don&#39;t show up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roc grinned. &quot;Full moons are the best. All of our brothers get together and we spend the whole next three days hunting, fucking, and fighting. It&#39;s the greatest. Maybe we could bring Alex? I bet one of our brothers might now something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raf cast Roc a disparaging look. &quot;You know it&#39;s werewolves only. Nar will skin us if we show up with a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Nar can make that okay.&quot; Roc said, with almost childlike innocence. &quot;Make Alex a werewolf. Like he did you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raf smiled and shook his head. &quot;Oh my sweet, Roc, you always want to take in the strays.&quot; Alex new he was wearing a confused look, and Rad noticed. &quot;We can turn humans into werewolves. Well, the Alpha can, but it&#39;s only done in very special circumstances. &quot;I was turned into a werewolf as a reward for saving Roc from hunters and nursing him back to health. So as thanks Nar offered it to me, also because Roc was insisting I was his mate, so it was easier that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we&#39;re sending Alex off on his own, we could at least give him the touch. Look at him, he&#39;s scrawny and weak and he might get hurt without us to help him.&quot; Rock blurted out. Alex felt his cheeks coloring. Okay, so he was a little on the scrawny side, especially compared to the leanly muscled Raf, and the stacked bulk of Roc.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we could.&quot; Raf said, sounding a little reluctant. &quot;He&#39;d have to be okay with it.&quot; Alex knew he looked perplexed, but fortunately Raf didn&#39;t wait for him to ask. &quot;Only Alphas can make new werewolves, but Betas like me and Roc can give a lesser form of the blessing called the touch. Each Beta&#39;s touch is different and you can only bear one Beta&#39;s touch. Like if you wanted it from me, your senses would get sharper. You&#39;d be able to hear or even smell people sneaking up on you and see better in the dark. Roc&#39;s touch will make you stronger, and make it easier for you to grow your muscles. But either way you&#39;ll end up with a wolf mark. Something showing you&#39;ve been touched by a werewolf. Might be yellow eyes, or fangs. It&#39;s usually a little thing but those who know what they&#39;re looking for can pick it out. Werewolves can always tell when someone&#39;s been touched, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex finished his food and set the plate aside. &quot;Do I have to pick now? Can I think on it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. The magic only works at night with the moon out, and this close to the full moon, it&#39;ll be nice and potent.&quot; Raf grinned brightly. &quot;Or you can just say no. It&#39;ll make your journey easier, and might help you out in the future, but not everyone might be welcoming to someone with a wolf mark. &quot;So.. what&#39;ll it be? Me, Roc, or just stay yourself?&quot;</p>
