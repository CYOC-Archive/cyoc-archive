<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning woke up kind of stressed.  Solomon noticed this and grabbed Kai to the shower.  He kissed Kai all over making his way down to his cock.  He took it in his mouth and sucked, grabbing Kai&#39;s ass.  Kai leaned up against the wall, moaning, as he grabbed Solomon&#39;s hair.  As he exploded into Solomon&#39;s mouth with one final loud moan, he pulled Solomon up, holding his head and kissed him. As he got ready Kai was worried about the meet coming up at the school later in the week.  Despite the fact that he and Solomon were amazing swimmers and they now had Cal instead of Mitchell, made him worry that made this wasn&#39;t enough for a win.  <br />
<br />
He got dressed, wearing a pair of board shorts and a tight t shirt that had the frat&#39;s letters on them.  He sent a text to Ty saying he&#39;s meet him in front of the athletic center in 30 min.  Outside the Athletic center Kai and Solomon killed time tricking on their boards.  The coach had laid into them about about how their skating could lead to a serious injury.  They just rolled their eyes and ignored him.  True he wasn&#39;t as good as his little brother but he went more towards the jock type in high school.  As he jumped a railing on a set of stairs, he saw the big black behemoth approaching.<br />
Kai flipped his board and carried in under his arm and approached him &quot;Tyrone?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s me!  You my boy Jae&#39;s older bro?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
&quot;Yup!  Nice to meet you!&quot;  he and Ty fist bumped.  &quot;You are huge man!!  Little bro didn&#39;t do you justice!&quot; he said staring at his huge arms and chest.<br />
&quot;Well body-building is one of my passions, but I guess wrestling is gonna get me through college.&quot; He said.<br />
&quot;This is my bf Solomon...not only is he sexy as hell, but he&#39;s one hell of a swimmer.&quot; Kai said.<br />
Ty and Solomon fist bumped and then all three headed into the athletic center.  Ty found it a little weird that Kai would mention swimming but just brushed it off.  As they headed in Ty said &quot;You know I always wanted to learn to swim but never got the chance because I had other priorities.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t say...&quot; Kai grinned.<br />
<br />
As they gave Ty a tour of the athletic center, Kai pulled out his portable maker and got to work. They passed the weight room, which Ty didn&#39;t notice because he was sending a text to Luca saying how he missed him and was looking forward to seeing him after practice, and a second text saying that Jae&#39;s brother seemed ok but Jae definitely was hotter.<br />
&quot;And finally we are here!&quot; Kai said.<br />
Ty looked up from his phone to see an Olympic sized swimming pool and was more than a little confused.  &quot;Cute..I said I don&#39;t know how to swim and you bring me here.  I thought you were gonna show me the weight room and introduce me to the wrestling coach.&quot; <br />
&quot;I thought you said you wanted to swim.&quot;  Kai grinned.  &quot;What are you talking about?  Wrestling?  We got a meet coming up.&quot;<br />
&quot;What am I talkin about? What are you talking about?  Yo, man this situation is just too weird!  I don&#39;t know what game you&#39;re playin but I&#39;m out.&quot; Ty said starting to get angry.  He turned to leave, cell phone falling out of his pocket.  As he turned to pick it up he froze.  Either Jae and Park were getting taller or he was getting shorter...he were the bones in his body crunching as they got smaller.  He went from 6&#39;5 to 5&#39;11.  His feet went from a size 15 to a size 11.  His khakis dropped the floor with his underwear.  His calves and quads had shrunk becoming leaner, more befitting of a swimmer.  In his confusion over what was happening to him physically, all he could think about was Luca.  His biceps and pecs shrunk becoming leaner but were still a good size.  His weight settled at 170.  Then he watched in horror as his skin changed from black to white.  <br />
&quot;Why you doin this?!?&quot;  Ty yelled.<br />
&quot;Sorry bud, but we needed a swimmer and here you are...&quot; Kai responded calmly<br />
&quot;But Jae said you were cool!  Why me?  You got a whole campus of dudes.  He&#39;s gonna wonder where I am...so is my...&quot;  Ty yelled out as his skin color turned his face, thinning his lips, changing his eyes from brown to blue, his grew out until styled into a fauxhax as it first changed blond and then blue.  Ty felt new memories overwriting his current memories.  He grew up in London but his family moved to the US when he was 16.  He was accepted to the school on an academic scholarship.  He tried out for the swim team his freshman year and made the team.   He remembered growing up swimming  in Britain and continued stateside.  As for looks, he could have been Tom Daley&#39;s brother.  As the last of his identity vanished, a tear shed down his face.  He had no idea what just happened or what he had done.  He felt something slink up his legs, noticing it was a black speedo.  His khakis darkened and the material thicken to denim.  The jeans, which had holes in places that made in certain spots, climbed to his 30 in waist.  His sneakers shrank and changed into a black pair of Yeezy Boost 350s.  His shirt changed to a black t shirt with The Who&#39;s logo on it, hugging his body, leaving nothing to the imagination.  Where Ty wore baggy clothes and was pretty humble about his body, 20 year old Cole Hall was proud of his body and heritage.<br />
&quot;Sup mates?  Why we all standin around?  Why&#39;d you want me to meet you here?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you remember?  We met for practice to prep for the meet and now are leaving to get something to eat.&quot;  Kai said.<br />
&quot;Aint nothin to worry about mate, we are gonna blow em out the water.  I don&#39;t know why you always get so worked.  You know how amazin I am.&quot; he cockily grinned as he dropped his jeans, revealing a speedo that now had the union jack on it, which hugged  his cock and balls leaving nothing to the imagination.  Yes Cole was not only proud of his heritage, but as Kai learned, also a bit of an exhibitionist.  He smiled.</p>
