<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Catching the falling gem, you slowly opened your hand to see that your fate was… tails. With this choice of fate now made, you planned to stick by it. Sure you’ll help people if they&#39;re in trouble but now you won’t go looking for it. With this change of plans, you realized that you would be spending a lot of time in your new cave home with that in mind, you slowly looked over the title of every book still left from your trove for ones specifically about conjuring. Once all the books you found had been absorbed, you set to work.<br />
<br />
“Even with my new boulder blocked entrance, enough people could move it and steal my loot, so I&#39;ll have to create a storage room only I can enter for it.”<br />
<br />
Thinking of the basic idea you wanted, you slowly spread your new magical powers over the stone walls of the horde room, causing the walls to slowly reform into flat surfaces with runes you learned from the books all around. Next came the door, you conjured a full steel door with only a simple handle on both sides and a different set of runes on the inside face to make it to where no one but you with your magical aura could open it then put it in place.<br />
<br />
“Now that, that&#39;s over with, I need to think about what I’m going to do with my life.”<br />
<br />
Taking a seat on a quickly conjured chair, you set off on thinking what to do with your life now.<br />
<br />
‘I could write my own spell books in case I forget something, my money will run out at some point if something happens so a job to make some gems and pass the time would also be good, a family would also be nice but I have no idea if I can get a girl pregnant now so that’ll wait until later. Maybe becoming a mercenary/bodyguard will work, fighting is all I&#39;ll be good at now and I don&#39;t want to use anymore potions on myself unless I have to.’<br />
<br />
With a plan now set on your life, you decided to change your style to fit the occasion. Using your new magic, you reformed your armor to turn it from being indestructible and plain looking to indestructible and amazing. First was the color as you darkened the polished steel to an Obsidian black, next was the shape as you made the armor much more demonic looking with spikes and jagged edges, finally came the new helmet you made from some the useless scrap. Unlike a priest, your enchanting only went as far as making it indestructible while looking like the rest of your armor but unable produce the same purifying qualities as the rest.<br />
<br />
Now that you had the look, next you needed the business. Grabbing your satchel, you emptied its contents into your new vault and added a infinite space charm then simply filled it with gems until you felt you had enough. Now filled with gems, you set off to Tel’Adre square.<br />
<br />
Your sudden arrival and frightening appearance caused a bit of panic but, with the amount of guards watching you, the inhabitants quickly settled down. Not seeing it as a good place to set up shop, you delved further into the city into its furthest and darkest corners until you found exactly what you were looking for. The area was filled with shops and building that had closed down. Picking the largest of the buildings at 4 stories high, you barged your way through the doors and they gave way with little resistance.<br />
<br />
Instead of being empty though, the building was filled with people of all shapes and sizes though none of them looked friendly. Not wanting to look flustered, you kept calm and tried think of what to do.<br />
<br />
“Who’s in charge?”<br />
<br />
Or simply forget about that and probably make things worse.<br />
<br />
“That would be me big guy.”<br />
<br />
It was a female lizards person who spoke up and caused the rest to start whispering though the general sense of surprise was still there.<br />
<br />
“My name is Talek, what’s yours.”<br />
<br />
The sensual sound of her voice almost set you off but my resolve kept me in check.<br />
<br />
“M-My name is Jeff.”<br />
<br />
The stutter seemed to make her happy, and her being happy sent warning signals to your brain to control itself.<br />
<br />
“Well then, Jeff, what brings you here.”<br />
<br />
Feeling much more confident, you answered back.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve come to take this place as the spot of my new residence for becoming a mercenary/bodyguard for hire through either reason or force.”<br />
<br />
“And what, pray tell, could your reasoning be.”<br />
<br />
“In my satchel, I have loaded it purely with gems in hope of buying it from you.”<br />
<br />
“Tempting offer but if we wanted a sack of gems that big then we would just need to work a day or 2 so I&#39;ll say no. If you resort to force, we can always have a battle of leadership winner take all.”<br />
<br />
The gasps that went off around the room was almost deafening but you still managed to endure and answer the challenge the only way you could.<br />
<br />
“I accept. Pick a time and place, and I&#39;ll be there.”<br />
<br />
If possible, the lizard woman’s smile got brighter.<br />
<br />
“Right now, in the streets outside.”<br />
<br />
Letting her lead the way, you followed, with her gang right behind you. Once you finally reached the steps, you saw that Talek was already on the other side of the road. Taking a step forward, you were suddenly knocked back into the masses of the hand and squished the under your weight. Getting up, you checked and saw that everyone was alright if a little winded.<br />
<br />
Looking around for what his you, you found a strange ball shaped weight.<br />
<br />
“Do you like it, I use those specifically for battles of leadership to knock my opponents out of bounds. One more time, and not only do I get that bag, but I also get you.”<br />
<br />
Surprised from the thought behind her choice of venue, you realized she had the advantage in speed and range while you had toughness and strength at that was what she thought as you also had magic at your disposal if very little. Unsheathing your sword and readying your shield,  you decided to have a little fun with this fight. <br />
<br />
Stepping back into the fight, you blocked another weight and kicked it out of the ring so as to let her wear down her supplies. She was expecting this thought and simply dropped to all fours before scurrying towards you a fast as horse before flipping into the air and aimed a weight connected to her tail at your head while she spun. Blocking the attack with your shield you felt a blunt object hit the back of your knee a made you kneel before a strike to the head.<br />
<br />
‘Maybe I should have used magic to begin with.’<br />
<br />
With simple thought, a stone pillar erupted from the ground in the general direction of Talek and launched her out of bounds with a thump. Getting up, you readied your sword and shield again while she got back up and into the ring. Using a trick from her book, you charged at her and used the flat of your blade to swipe at her. She ducked under and away. Quickly following her with your body at the ready for an attack, you saw she had a look of rage and disgust mixed. <br />
<br />
‘Probably from the cheap shot but hey no-one said anything against magic.’<br />
<br />
Pulling an unknown cord from her jacket, a dozen weighted balls fell from under her coat before she pulled out 3 knives. One for each hand and one for her tail. She rushed again but without the balls slowing her down, she was even faster causing you to barely block her blades. Continuing to block, you went for a side chop with your sword but she simply jumped away. Seeing your chance, you created a new pillar to knock her back but she simply caught on to it.<br />
<br />
“You think because you have magic, you can do what you want? Well guess what, I&#39;ve killed hundreds of mages and you’ll end up like the rest of them after I rape you till you start begging for my cocks. When that happens, I’ll cum all over your stupid horny face then chop off your head to keep as a permanent trophy.”<br />
<br />
Throughout her spiel of rage, you slowly lengthened the pillar out wards until she was right over the edge. With her still distracted, I made the tip she was on break into pieces and dropped her out of the ring.<br />
<br />
“What, no, I won&#39;t let you turn me into a dumb whore.”<br />
<br />
She became muffled though a s black tendrils erupted from the ground and restrained her.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s happening?”<br />
<br />
It was one of the shocked gang members who answered.<br />
<br />
“A leadership challenge is a binding verbal oath that makes the recipients of the deal to follow through with the requirements. Since Talek lost, she has to transform into the perfect form for you then you make her yours for as long as you live. That’s what she did to the last boss before killing him.”<br />
<br />
Once done speaking, you turned back to the still struggling Talek who was now completely naked. Her entire body was the definition of smooth in a feminine shape same for 2 foot long cocks growing from her crotch. Once she was fully secured, a black tendril lodged itself into your chest as it took both knowledge of what you most desired in a sex partner and filled you with a small amount of lust. That  small amount though was enough as your codpiece became so uncomfortable, you have remove it or risk breaking your dick.<br />
<br />
Now fully erect at 4 feet long, you saw the sheer weight of it made your penis point downwards. The changes began for Talek. The first to happen was her skin started to flake and change to an olive like complexion and her snout pulled inwards on itself creating the general shape of a human woman. Next was the hair wick grew till it reached her ads as the color of fiery red. With a few more alterations, her face became beautiful with a button nose, almond shaped eyes, and pouty lips, next were her cocks. Slowly the 2 meat sticks shrunk inch after inch until only to small cliortis remained and combined into one. With the the shrinking and rearranging now done, her body began to inflate. First was her ass with blew up until both cheeks were the size of beach balls each and kept their round perkiness from before, next were the tits which grew and and grew until the were both the size of beach balls themselves though overinflated. Unlike the ass the tits each gained a slight sag making look much more squishable while also staying full and round. Next was the vagina the vagina puffed up quickly and started becoming wet with juices ready for me to insert my cock. The final change was he muscles, so as to not break during sex, her muscles gained a slight toned look with a slight 4 pack of abs though not very large or noticeable unless you looked real closely.<br />
<br />
Now fully transformed, the tendrils brought her wet snatch closer to your dick. Smelling the unending arousal from her, you quickly inserted into her without care and pumped as hard and as fast as you could without breaks. For over an hour you were pumping in and out with the tendrils disappearing at some point while Talek held on to you as she came one after another from your meaty pole. Your audience had already left so as to not be taken as forceful minions but you didn&#39;t care as Talek’s tight snatch felt like it was tightening after every orgasm she had. Finally you couldn&#39;t take it any longer and pushed all the way and even slightly past the cervix and dumped your load. The pure bliss you felt was nothing compared to what Talek  felt as she was now unconscious and hanging only by vagina and your 2 arms that kept her in place. When you finally finished emptying your balls, Talek’s womb was so filled it caused her gut to inflate. Pulling out of her, the cum you left in created an almost glue like effect as nothing left Talek’s womb.<br />
<br />
‘If she really turned into the girl I wanted then that means she should have gotten pregnant from this one time so I&#39;ll have to take her home.’<br />
<br />
With that thought, both you and Talek disappeared back to the cave</p>
