<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>After debating for a few moments, you realize that you were thirsty and wanted a drink. You walk into a bar with the old-time double swinging gates, creaking as you pushed through them, walking up to the bar counter. An equally large man introduced himself as Hank and that he was the bartender at the moment, then inquired what you would like to drink. Thinking for a second, you just go with a beer, thinking that would be the most satisfying. He smiles a toothy grin at you, which you notice to be slightly strange, as his teeth seemed sharper than normal. Not putting too much thought into it, you go back to paying attention to your own body.</Br>
<Br>You look your arms over, which were much more meaty and covered in thick, dark auburn hair, all the way down to your hands and fingers, which had seen their fair share of labor. Hank walks back over to where you were sitting, slides you the beer and gives you an inviting wink. You blush a bit, thankful though, being concealed under your thick inch long beard. Looking down into the neck of your shirt, you see that your chest had thickened in muscle and in the same dark hair on your face and arms. You smile wide, noticing something in the mirror behind the booze on the shelf. Thinking you might be seeing things, you run your tongue along your teeth and realize that they were sharp... just like Hank's.</Br>
<Br>Hank just stood in front of you, looking directly at you, then smiles again. "My... you are one fine specimen of a man!"</Br>
<Br>You chuckle. "Why thanks Hank, that is really sweet of you to say."</Br>
<Br>Hank blushes bright red, which you can see through his beard. "Well... it is true you know! So what is a nice bear like you doing in a gay single's bar? You must be with one lucky man!"</Br>
<Br>Not even realizing what he said, as if it were normal for you, you smile showing off your sharp teeth. "No, I am not with anyone for the moment. I think I would like to be though."</Br>
<Br>"Oh ho! That is good news... especially after what happened last night!"</Br>
<Br>Your eyebrow raised, curious to hear what happened to him. "What happened with you last night Hank?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... since you are a bearman like me, I know you will understand my situation. Last night I was at this wrestling place, they promised me that the guy I pinned would be mine to have, if I pinned him. They had me in a wrestling singlet that barely held in my manhood and in my bear form for that matter too. Needless to say, I pinned him and was going to take him back to my place for a romp, but he bit my shoulder, I scratched him not thinking about what that would do to him, then I lost him. I really would like to see him, apologize for the way I acted and ask for his forgiveness for cursing him."</Br>
<Br>While Hank was talking, everything that happened to you came back into your memory, realizing that this attractive man was the same bear who attacked you last night. After what happened and now hearing his side of the story, so to speak, you couldn't help but to want to know more.</Br>
<Br>"Hank, what do you mean by cursing him... not to mention why in the world would you need to go to that length in order to have somebody in the first place. You seem like a nice enough guy, being honest and sweet... not to mention conscientious and remorseful. Who wouldn't want a guy like you?"</Br>
<Br>You watched as his slight sulking turned into a bright smile, which you found that you grew fond of. "Thanks bud, those are real nice words. You know about the curse like I do, werebears that bite or scratch someone human, transmits the genes making the person into a werebear. I don't know about the second question really. The loneliness I have been feeling lately got the best of me and I just wanted be with someone... not to mention it feels better to have someone else get you off than doing it yourself... you know?"</Br>
<Br>"I completely understand you there bud. I also want to tell you something too."</Br>
<Br>"Oh... what would that be?" He asks giving you a very wry smile.</Br>
<Br>"Well... you don't have to really look to apologize to that guy you scratched last night. Hank... I am the guy you scratched."</Br>
<Br>His eyes widened, glossing over and teared up a bit. "Oh man, you don't know how this makes me feel. Can you forgive me for making you a monster like me, doomed to be part beast on top of being horny all the time?"</Br>
<Br>You reach a consoling hand over the counter, rubbing his cheek in a loving way and smile. "Hank... you are not a monster, frankly I rather like being this way instead of the smaller and less powerful man that I was before. I cannot tell you how this feels, though I am sure you know what I mean. If you could, forgive me for biting your shoulder last night, I was just scared."</Br>
<Br>"You don't need forgiveness because I blame myself for the way I acted with you. You had all the right in the world to be scared, I know I would have been had I been in your shoes."</Br>
<Br>Hank smiles at you and you return the gaze, realizing that your package had been straining against your pants all this time, not to mention forming a large wet-spot at the entire crotch of your jeans.</Br>
<Br>You feel your crotch, then grin at Hank, slightly embarrassed by your wet crotch. "I think I know what you mean by the constant being horny. Before, when I was normal, I could barely generate any precum and when I jacked off... I barely came. Now it would seem that all that is changed, cuz I am a little wet down below!"</Br>
<Br>Hank leaned over the bar to get a look at your crotch, his pushing against the bar, realizing he was just as wet... if not more. Sliding back down and looking right at you, he just nodded. "I know what you mean and I think you saw that I have same the problem."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I think you have a bigger problem than I do. It looked like your spot was bigger."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I generate pints of precum when I get aroused. Just out of curiosity, would you like to start where we left off last night?"</Br>
<Br>You think about it for a second, not really having to think about it in the first place because the answer was of course...</Br></p>
