<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allen stood in the middle of Nate’s living room. When his satyr friend had invited him over to watch a football game, this isn’t exactly how he had imagined his afternoon going. Here he was, standing on a pair of hooves, asking for Nate to use his little gadget to make his friends forget he was anything other than just another satyr.<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s give it a shot.” Allen finally nodded his head, “It’s just one night.”<br />
<br />
Nate smiled, “Baah, see you on the other side.”<br />
<br />
He dramatically tapped the apply button on his Chronivac. The device let out a pleasant beep, and then suddenly the three felt like their ears were filled with a faint ringinging.<br />
<br />
Allen had seen the Chronivac at work before. He had gotten to see Marcus’ species shift back and forth right before their eyes. He had even managed to catch the device write his clothing out of reality. This was something else entirely though. The room felt like it was spinning. Details were popping in and out of existence, and it felt hard to focus on any one thing.<br />
<br />
Allen finally noticed the smell of the room change. The enticing aroma of fried potatoes and bread had completely vanished from Nate’s apartment. In their place, a small cheese and cracker board sat on the coffee table in front of the sofa.<br />
<br />
It would pair well with the wine. The wine! There were six bottles sitting out now, now just the one from before. Satyrs loved to drink, but there was something else… None of them had proper labels. Allen bent down and picked one up curiously.<br />
<br />
“Zinfandel, Batch 82.” The bottle’s identify was hastily written on a strip of blue painter’s tape. The smooth even lettering of the marker pen was familiar to Allen. This was his handwriting.<br />
<br />
He’d brought wine and cheese from work. Err, what? He worked at a big office doing- Allen was a vineyard manager. Satyrs had a stereotype of working out in the country, and it was a trope he was more than willing to live up to. His brother Marcus was the city slicker.<br />
<br />
Marcus! Allen quickly looked up at his brother. The satyr was just sitting there obliviously. He hadn’t seen the room spin. He hadn’t noticed the wine appear. He was just sitting there idly as his face started to change and shift.<br />
<br />
His chiseled jaw was always one of his most striking features. The edges of it were smoothing out however. He was gaining a more rounded chin like… like… like his! Allen had always had more smoother features. He was watching in real time as Marcus gained some of his appearance. Allen felt his own face start to tingle as well. His brow seemed to push forward as he gained his brother’s prominent bushy eyebrows.<br />
<br />
His- His brother! Allen felt an odd familial bond growing as the two of them took on an identical appearance. They weren’t just brothers, they were twins! Allen had always been an only child, it felt odd to just be in the company of family.<br />
<br />
Only, no it didn’t. A second later the Chronivac wrote over that part of his history. The quiet afternoons as a kid slipped mentally through his fingers, and suddenly Allen could recall always having his twin right there by his side growing up.<br />
<br />
The kinship was like nothing else. Still, kids always try to set themselves apart from their siblings. Twins doubly so. There’s always the instinct to try and build an identity for yourself. Everyone knew Marcus was the book smart satyr, so Allen had instead thrown himself into track and field.<br />
<br />
Allen felt his body tingle. He looked down to see his copy of Marcus’ body shift in subtle ways. He stayed just as tall, and his wine gut was staying firmly in place, but new muscles were starting to form underneath. He wasn’t an athlete anymore, but he still had an impressive build underneath all that satyr indulgence. Baah! No wonder he had signed up to push barrels around!<br />
<br />
Despite being the track star and social butterfly, Marcus was the one who had introduced him to Nate. Allen usually wasn’t one for city-satyrs, but he had this cute smile and- Baah! The, the memories wouldn’t stop flooding in! Allen tried to focus on his human self. It was there still, but the details were hard to surface. It was like trying to dredge up specifics after a long dream.<br />
<br />
“Baah, got anything good for us A?” Marcus bleated eagerly. His brother was holding onto an empty wine glass.<br />
<br />
The nickname caught Allen off guard. He tried to break out of his hazy stupor. Somehow the taste of the wine in his hand surfaced to the top of his mind. “Baah? Oh, yeah! Hope you’re up for a fruity red.”<br />
<br />
Allen started to uncork the wine. It felt odd to feel his hands move so expertly around a bottle. His body immediately fell into the groove of the many wine tastings he helped out with on a daily basis. He had a trio of glasses poured in no time.<br />
<br />
“Baah, why thank you,” Marcus wagged. He took two of the glasses and offered one to Nate. The two satyrs had gotten comfortable on the small sofa again. This time however they had left space for Allen.<br />
<br />
“What, oh, thanks!” Nate looked up with a start. He took the wine glass reflexively from Marcus.<br />
<br />
His… hands were empty. He was easily able to take one of the glasses. He had the weirdest sensation that he was just playing with his phone. But it was sitting a good ways over on the coffee table. Was he messing with the Chornivac again?<br />
<br />
Nate glanced over his shoulder and into his bedroom. No, the reality altering device was sitting safely on his nightstand. He had given Owen a nice long charge after all of the changes in the last two days. He was still surprised at how thoroughly it had made him a satyr. He had tried changing back, but it just hadn’t stuck. He was a satyr through and through now.<br />
<br />
He hardly felt any desire to mess with the device anymore. Nate had been so eager to use with it when it first showed up, but somehow he didn’t feel like toying with it today. Right now all he wanted to do was relax and enjoy the life of a satyr. He hoped inviting some of his goaty friends over could help take his mind off things.<br />
<br />
“Baah, wow, you look kind of out of it,” Marcus bleated. He ruffled Nate’s hair playfully, “Work still giving you a hard time?”<br />
<br />
“Something like that,” Nate sipped the wine. “Oh hey, this is pretty good!”<br />
<br />
Allen plopped down on the sofa. He took a sip of it and- Oh hey! He was right! This batch turned out pretty well. “Baah, thanks! We gave this one a little bit more time in the barrels.”<br />
<br />
The sofa was getting a little full now. Marcus had spread out on the far end, Allen had slid over the other arm, and Nate was squeezed in the middle.<br />
<br />
Allen only just now realized how much physically larger he was. He had gained a few inches when he had taken on M’s build, and his hips were a bit wider too. Nate was pretty pinned down. Their waists brushed up against each other as he got comfortable on the sofa. Baah, it felt nice to let their fur intertwine like this.<br />
<br />
“Baah, speaking of hard times, it looks like A’s ready to cheer you up,” Marcus said with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
“What?” Allen went flush. He squirmed a bit on the sofa, and then realized what Marcus was teasing him about.<br />
<br />
Allen’s body had reacted pretty much <i>immediately</i> to all their closeness. He could feel a throbbing between his legs. As his spread his thighs, he got an up close and personal view of a glistening goat cock.<br />
<br />
“Baah! Sorry, I-“ Allen stammered. This… this was turning him on!?<br />
<br />
“Relax,” Nate said with the same tone of voice he had been using to coax Allen into his changes a moment before. “Nothing I haven’t seen before.”<br />
<br />
What did <i>that</I> mean!? Nate leaned over and ran his fingers along the inside of Allen’s thigh. Oh <i>baah!</i> That felt really nice…! Nate’s hand slid up a bit further and gently teased the base of Allen’s shaft.<br />
<br />
“Baah! W-what’s happening?” Allen sat up straight. Reality had seemed to stop spinning around them, but his mind was still reeling.<br />
<br />
“I <i>may</i> not have invited you over just to watch football,” Nate bleated playfully.<br />
<br />
“<i>Really now?</I>” Marcus bleated playfully. “Is someone up for a different sort of recreational activity?”<br />
<br />
His brother took a nice big swig of wine, the playfully set both his glass and Nate’s on the table. Without any additional preamble, he bent over and grabbed Nate by whatever the goat equivalent of ankles were. Their host let out a string of flustered bleats as Marcus lifted his legs up onto the sofa. Instead of being pinned between the two satyrs, Nate was now firmly laying across both of their laps.<br />
<br />
“W-Would you care to explain yourself M!?” Allen stuttered.<br />
<br />
“Baah, just because you get it up first doesn’t mean you always get to be on top,” Marcus beamed.<br />
<br />
Baah! By Pan’s scruff! Sex was happening! How was he going to break it to these two that he was straight? Allen knew satyrs had a stereotype, but this was ridiculous! The game was still in the first quarter!<br />
<br />
Oh man, Nate seemed to know his way around a sheath! Baah, not just any sheath. <i>His sheath.</i> Allen’s body clearly didn’t get the memo about his proclivities. Nate’s Chronivac had already changed so much about his life. Had it made him gay too!?<br />
<br />
“You don’t mind being the front end of the spit for once, right Allen?” Nate bleated eagerly. He leaned forward on the sofa and gave his cock a nice long lick.<br />
<br />
Baah! For once!? More memories came rushing back in. This was… this was their go to move. Satyrs had a reputation, and everyone had a thing for twins. They’d fooled around with Nate dozens of times in the past. Countless times!<br />
<br />
As if to demonstrate, Marcus slid off the sofa and grabbed a towel that was hidden underneath it. This wasn’t their first rodeo in this living room alone. A bit of prep up front can spare a big cleanup afterwards. Marcus discretely placed the towel underneath Nate’s prone body.<br />
<br />
“L-lube’s in the end table…!” Allen bleated. There was still a stutter in his voice, but it was more from Nate’s fondling at this point. He could feel his breath hitch as Nate leaned down and gave his manhood a nice long lick.<br />
<br />
“Baah, I know,” Marcus grinned. He grabbed the small plastic bottle and began to play with his own sheath. Allen could see the family resemblance once more. Marcus’ goat cock looked just like his.<br />
<br />
Marcus spread Nate’s legs and started teasing underneath the satyr’s tail. Nate let out an eager bleat as his own manhood pushed out up against the towel on the sofa.<br />
<br />
“Are- are we really doing this?” Allen bleated in astonishment at the scene that was unfolding in front of him.<br />
<br />
The two of course had no idea what Allen was going through. They thought he was just another one of the guys. Just another horny satyr passing time before the game got good. Both of them looked up at Allen.<br />
<br />
“Baah? You can be on top if you want A,” Marcus flashed him a sympathetic smile. “I just thought I’d mix things up.”<br />
<br />
Right! Baah, of course they’d misread things. What would satyr Allen do in this situation?“No no, this is fine…!” Allen slid off the sofa gently, “Just let me get into position. If I’m face fucking Nate, I’m going to do it right.”<br />
<br />
Baaaaah! Woah, did that come out of his mouth?<br />
<br />
“Now that’s my bro,” M beamed.<br />
<br />
Allen clopped around the sofa and in front of the arm rest. Nate was now fully splayed out as he arched between the two ends of the furniture. Allen couldn’t help but feel his tail wag at the sight of his soon-to-be-spit-roasted friend. This was apparently something he did on the regular? Baah, time to lean in.<br />
<br />
Literally.<br />
<br />
Nate made sure to give his cock some extra attention as Allen got into place. Just like opening the wine before, Allen was finding himself settling into a pleasant groove of muscle memory. The bewilderment of the scene was being replaced by a low-key jealousy of his twin calling dibs on his usual spot.<br />
<br />
A trio of panting bleats started to fill the house as they got to work. Nate did his best to keep stroking his shaft, but there was only so much you could do when you were getting plowed by Marcus. Eventually Allen settled for grabbing Nate by the horns and just sliding in and out of their friend’s eager mouth.<br />
<br />
Baah! So this is what satyrs got up to when there weren’t any humans around…! Allen could hardly blame Nate for leaping horns first into this lifestyle. Something about their three bodies moving as one made Allen forget all the panic he had beforehand. If nothing else, sex made for get stress release.<br />
<br />
Allen’s stress released all over Nate’s face. Baah! The towel coverage up front wasn’t as good as in the back. Allen watched as his cum ran down Nate’s red cheeks and into the glossy leather.<br />
<br />
The satyr looked up at him with a smile. “Baah, hair trigger.” He flashed him a wink and leaned into Marcus’ thrusting.<br />
<br />
Allen enjoyed floating in the sea of his endorphins as the two finished up. Baah, he was always first to rise and first to finish. Heh, although in this case it was hard to tell if it was just how out of shape his twin had gotten.<br />
<br />
Nate made a mess of the sofa first. Before Allen could contemplate teasing M any, he finally let lose his load. Nate was absolutely full of goat seed at this point. The two had really made a mess of him… and none of them seemed to care in the slightest. This was quite the lifestyle they led.<br />
<br />
Marcus finally pulled out of Nate. He clopped backwards and practically collapsed in the empty armchair. Ha! He was so out of breath. Marcus panted softly as Nate made a token effort of toweling himself off.<br />
<br />
“You doin’ alright there bro?” Allen grinned.<br />
<br />
Marcus tried glaring at Allen, but he was feeling just as good right now. “Baah, you make that look easy. Just gimme a minute.”<br />
<br />
“Baah, thanks you two,” Nate grinned. “I needed that.”<br />
<br />
Nate started toweling down the sofa halfheartedly. He’d probably need to fully wipe it down after they left. But it was clean enough to sit on for now.<br />
<br />
“I think I did too,” Allen flopped down on the sofa beside Nate.<br />
<br />
The satyr leaned over on his shoulder. Baah, this was almost stranger than the sudden gay sex. The closeness felt nice though. The two of them just sat there and enjoyed the relative silence of Marcus’ panting.<br />
<br />
Allen should say something. Earlier Nate had been fretting about the Chronivac and staying as a satyr. What had reality shifted to again? Generic work stress? <br />
<br />
“So what’s this whole work thing you’re going through?” Allen bleated.<br />
<br />
“Arg!” Nate’s ears perked, “We’re going through a reorg right now. It’s a huge mess.”<br />
<br />
Allen tried to keep up with the conversation. He knew he had experiences with reorgs in the past, but now suddenly the only experience he could think of was when his vineyard got some new owners and ran through a restructuring a while back.<br />
<br />
Marcus started snoring on the sofa towards the end of their conversation. Nate laughed, “Does he do this every time he tops, or am I just special?”<br />
<br />
Allen leaned forward and turned up the TV, “Every time.”<br />
<br />
He took a sip from his wine, but stopped himself from going too far. The knowledge that he was their driver today bubbled to the top of his mind. Baah, driving with hooves was going to be a trip!<br />
<br />
So… was he ready to go explore the rest of his satyr life? Or should he try and say something to Nate before his twin woke up?</p>
