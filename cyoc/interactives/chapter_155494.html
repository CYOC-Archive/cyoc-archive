<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Who is they?&quot; Samuel Hansen asked quickly while flashing a flip of one wrist to Gretel Buckner to head out and around the house, assuming that the person who&#39;d gone out was likely the one who&#39;d called the operator to get Samantha Twist&#39;s number and used a cellphone to do it.<br />
<br />
Gretel was quick to nod and walked away from the front door and toward the side of the house. This got the woman who&#39;d answered the door a bit surprised and she tried to call after Gretel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Where are you going?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re detectives with the Moon Lake Police,&quot; Detective Hansen spoke firmly and quickly, letting Gretel disappear around the front corner of the house, &quot;we have reason to believe that someone from this house called the city directory from this house to get Samantha Twist&#39;s phone number about ten minutes before the Twists received a threatening phone call from a pay phone in the park that isn&#39;t that far away from here. At the very least we&#39;d like to ask the man who likely just bolted out your back door a few questions. Now, WHO is he and WHO are THEY when it comes to being hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My boys couldn&#39;t call the directory... they&#39;re only five and barely know my husband&#39;s cellphone number for emergencies,&quot; the woman answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your husband?&quot; Detective Hansen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg Penn... why...&quot; the woman stammered, &quot;You don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay here,&quot; Detective Hansen said firmly and then joined Gretel in pursuit of whoever had fled out the back door. <br />
<br />
They at least now had a name, Greg Penn that they could attach to possible suspects in the threatening phone call over this planned reveal. And the fact that someone, likely Greg, himself, had rushed out the back just as Samuel and Gretel started talking with the woman presented at least enough to indicate that the man had something to hide. And as Samuel Hansen joined the pursuit, he was forced to get up to full speed and relying on his sense of smell to guide him, as Gretel had already gone ahead, which as a weredog was quite good. He quickly caught Gretel&#39;s scent as it went through the backyard and between a pair of houses behind the house that they&#39;d pulled up to. He was quick to chase after it and trying to stay alert for anything.<br />
<br />
He got that chance as he reached the next two houses as he heard the screeching of a car&#39;s breaks followed by a male voice yelling out &quot;hey!&quot;  As Detective Hansen came out from between those two houses, he was able to see Gretel make a flying tackle at a well built man, who looked like he&#39;d stumbled a bit as if to avoid being hit by a red family car that that had been coming around one of the circular roads that made up the center of Moon Lake&#39;s wagon wheel layout. Gretel&#39;s tackle brought the man to the ground and bought Samuel time to catch up. He pulled out his detective&#39;s badge that he kept pinned to his wallet and flashed it to the driver as he ran by the car and approached the scene where the wrestling match was now tacking place.<br />
<br />
The male was easily bigger than Gretel, and Samson got a bit of &quot;werelion&quot; scent from him. In this, he had a major strength advantage over Gretel, even in human form, and he was beginning to actually roll her over onto her back in order to prepare to either land blows or run away. Samuel put an end to that by drawing his gun and placing it to the back of the man&#39;s had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put your hands on your head,&quot; Samuel commanded<br />
<br />
The man paused and looked over his shoulder to see the gun barrel pointed at him and the fight seemed to fall out of him. He let go of Gretel and raised his arms to his head while looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg Penn?&quot; Samuel asked as he pulled out his cuffs with his free hand and then fastened one end around the man&#39;s wrist while holding his gun so that it would remain pointed at the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the man, Greg Penn, responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Greg, bring your other hand down so it is behind your back,&quot; Samuel instructed.<br />
<br />
Greg complied and once Samuel got the other cuff fixed and Greg Penn&#39;s arms were stuck behind his back, Samuel pulled Greg up to his feet and letting Gretel get up on her own. They then began to walk Greg Penn back toward the sidewalk on the route that he&#39;d taken. Gretel waved the car that had essentially helped the capture a wave of her hand and presented her own detective&#39;s badge in order to authorize the motorist to then continue on the route he&#39;d been driving on before the pursuit of a lone man came in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... care to explain why you decided to run when you heard us talking with your wife, Greg?&quot; Samuel Hansen asked as the reached the sidewalk and began walking back through the yards back to where the whole chase had started and with the wife appearing the backyard of the house where the chase began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just going out,&quot; Greg said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;At a bolting run when your wife was talking about dinner?&quot; Gretel asked.<br />
<br />
Greg didn&#39;t have an answer for that as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, Greg Penn,&quot; Samuel spoke, &quot;You are under arrest for making a criminal threat against Samantha Twist to Frances Twist and resisting arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and WILL be used against you in a court of law...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know my rights,&quot; Greg grumbled as they got closer to the Penn family home and as his wife came forward. Two sets of eyes from young children also looked out from behind the screen door above the back steps. &quot;I was just trying to make sure everyone keeps theirs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg...&quot; his wife came forward, &quot;they said you made a threat to the Town Chancellor... is that true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know he called the directory from this address and then got the Twists phone number,&quot; Samuel spoke, &quot;and based on what the Twists reported as the time of the call... the pay phone in the park is within walking distance from your house to make said call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the fact that he ran before we could even ask any questions would further confirm that suspicion,&quot; Gretel added, &quot;for if he&#39;d done nothing... there would be no need to run.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg said nothing and his wife held her hands over her mouth as Samuel and Gretel walked him back to their car. As they got to the back door to the car, which, like the standard police cars the Moon Lake PD owned had no internal latches or window openers, Greg looked back to his wife, who silently followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was only protecting the boys,&quot; Greg pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Threatening someone else protects no one,&quot; Gretel spoke as she opened the back door and Samuel then helped Greg into the back seat and buckled Greg in.<br />
<br />
Once Greg was buckled in, Samuel Hansen turned back to the wife and spoke, &quot;we will take your husband back to the station for processing and holding. If you have an attorney, please contact him or her and have the attorney contact us and we can handle all official questioning from there... though that should be within the next hour. If you don&#39;t and he requests a lawyer, our questioning will have to wait until we can get a lawyer assigned to your husband as far as questioning goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course...&quot; the wife said weakly as the two detectives  got into the front seat of their car and soon pulled away.</p>
