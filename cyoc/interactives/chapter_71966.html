<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a few months since Dan and his pups moved into their new apartment, on the whole it was rather <br />
basic but it was large enough to accommodate the four of them. It only had one bedroom and one kitchen but in <br />
this world all apartments were accommodating to people of Patrick’s size. They had to share the one bed, <br />
usually Dan would make himself the filling of his own ginger sandwich, laying in bed between Patrick and <br />
Marcus while Angus would sleep on the ground at their feet, too big for a bed designed to hold just one Angus-<br />
sized redhead.<br />
<br />
The bedding caused his pups to sweat throughout the night. Often Dan would wake up with his arm around one of <br />
his pups, the entire room filled with the heady smell of redhead sweat and cum.  The overcharged ginger sex <br />
drive and need to get off continued through their sleep, with timely wet dreams, whimpering and quietly <br />
uttering their need for their Master under their breath. The linen had to be laundered fairly often but one of <br />
Dan’s submissives would always volunteer for the role. The three took supreme pride in keeping a clean and <br />
made house for their Master.<br />
<br />
These sleeping arrangement worked out rather well for Dan and his pups. Every morning before the sun rose, the <br />
ginger’s balls would be full, their need for their Master’s attention would be at the maximum. Almost like a <br />
natural alarm clock, the mild whimpering and cravings would start at a low level and gradually over the period <br />
of minutes it would become louder, waking Dan up in what he could imagine to be the most pleasant way <br />
possible. Three impossibly beefy and loyal pups fawning for his attention. Without any need for vocalised <br />
orders, Dan would give his signal and his three pups would assume their morning ritual. At either side of Dan <br />
one of his gingers would suck passionately on his nipples, meanwhile the third at the bottom of the bed would <br />
take his Master’s cock into his mouth with fervour and content. This is what his pups lived for. Each role was <br />
equally important, their Master’s satisfaction is their number one priority, their very participation in such <br />
a ritual was a gift for which they were all thankful for. The one sucking his Master’s cock would drink his <br />
Master’s cum as a reward for his efforts.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, when Dan wanted to assert his Mastery upon his pups. He would wake up and order his pups to get <br />
ready for the day. He would instruct his pups to hold onto this feeling for the rest of the day, if they <br />
behaved themselves they may get release by the end of the day, Angus excluded of course. Dan much prefered <br />
that his pups got their satisfaction through giving their Master pleasure, their balls full to aching.   <br />
<br />
Seeing as Patrick, Angus and Marcus had all discontinued their studies and Dan could do his classes online, <br />
there seemed to be little point in staying in their tiny college town. Besides, Dan felt that it was better <br />
for his pups to make a clean break in a new city rather than have aspects of their old world reminding them, <br />
it would just make their transition easier.<br />
<br />
Overall things had gone quite well for Dan and his pups. Dan would go out for the day and he would always <br />
return to his cosy apartment, with everything impeccably clean and tidy and with a hearty meal ready to be <br />
served, his pups naked or in jockstraps waiting anxiously by the door for their Master to come home after what <br />
felt like an eternity away. It came somewhat of a surprise to Dan just how much his three gingers had to eat <br />
all the time in order to maintain and increase their mass. Between the three of them they split the full time <br />
job of cooking and food preparation. It would have perhaps been easier if they had all decided to eat out more <br />
often but Dan always found that they were at a state of unease when they left the house.<br />
<br />
Angus, Patrick and Marcus were all competent cooks, enjoying creating fusions of flavours and spices for their <br />
Master - but each of them having particular specialties. Angus, growing up in the countryside was a master of <br />
baking home-made breads, stews, soups and roast vegetables. Marcus was quite fond of cooking French cuisine - <br />
the high calories, robust flavours and discipline required appealing to his sensibilities. Patrick’s <br />
specialisations were foods of Thailand, Vietnam and Japan, he also was quite fond exploring the essences of <br />
flavours, often experimenting with different and unusual combinations- for better or for worse. Overall it <br />
could be said that Dan and his pups ate very well. <br />
…<br />
<br />
It had been a few months since that day on the tattoo studio for Patrick. He was pretty sure that there was <br />
something in his past before then, but his past before that date seemed to have an ethereal and fleeting <br />
quality to him, almost like the last few clasps of a dream just after waking up. Not that it seemed all that <br />
important to Patrick, for what it’s worth his life began the day he moved into the apartment with his <br />
brothers. Occasionally, Patrick would get a flash of a face or a memory of a smell from before then, he <br />
couldn’t help but feel slightly off put. These moments were to become increasingly infrequent as time would <br />
stretch on, until he would find that they never happened at all. <br />
<br />
Within his mind, Patrick’s brain was being overwritten, what he had before being replaced with something much <br />
more demanding and urgent. His Master’s expectations and orders were rebuilding Patrick from the inside out, <br />
he was becoming remade in the image of his Master’s desires. This was also happening simultaneously to Marcus <br />
and Angus. The process was a constant rush for Patrick, he savoured the idea of continuing to change for the <br />
benefit of his beloved Master, every day bringing him closer to the perfection he craved to be for his Master. <br />
It just felt so... right. The more Patrick felt this feeling, the more he gave himself over to it.<br />
<br />
All Patrick could possibly think about all day was serving his Master. He would be preoccupied with ways to <br />
make him smile, which seemed to Patrick like the most precious gift his Master could give to his pup. He <br />
craved to make his Master happy and to express his love and unending devotion through his service. <br />
Occasionally Patrick would find that he would be in the middle of an everyday thing like working out at the <br />
gym or buying groceries at the local farmers market and he would get a flash his Master’s amazing beauty in <br />
his mind. On a mild day this would cause his pup to weep tears that would drip down his into beard. One day <br />
after such an episode he returned to his Master, so ecstatic to see him describing the episode as being <br />
overcome with “exquisite sadness”.<br />
<br />
On bad days, Patrick would be so overcome that he would break down in the middle of whatever he was doing, <br />
having to call his Master and allowing the sound of his voice to give him enough composure to make his way <br />
home.<br />
<br />
Patrick tended to find that things that used to come to him so easily was becoming increasingly difficult for <br />
him. The confident, dominating Alpha which Dan had first collared disappearing piece by piece. Patrick thought <br />
he could remember being part of a debating club. He used to be able to cut people down with his sharp words. <br />
As the days past Patrick found that he was losing his words, becoming less and less reliant on them as he <br />
would pass through his days. Instead Patrick found that he communicated a lot more with grunts, noises, sounds <br />
and with his body language. Once upon a time Patrick had an admirable poker face, but these days he was easier <br />
to read than a billboard. When he was happy, Patrick’s face lit up, when he was sad or longing he would look <br />
like a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Communication took on a more basic quality to him.<br />
<br />
When Patrick had to leave the house it would be very rare for him to acknowledge other people. He had taken <br />
his Master’s order to not acknowledge other people or to speak to other people without his Master’s consent <br />
very much to heart. Sure, he knew when other people were present and the features of his environment, but to <br />
Patrick it seemed that they were on a different frequency to him, Patrick lived in his world in his subspace - <br />
everything else to him seeming like white noise, distracting.<br />
<br />
“Hey!  Patrick!”  Patrick paused...someone was calling his name.  “Patty!  Hey, big guy!  It’s me, Adrian.”  <br />
Patrick stood, searching his memory for this person...he felt annoyed, frustrated, and just wanted to continue <br />
with this errand for his Master.<br />
<br />
Patrick focused hard, quelling his growing social anxiety, “S-sorry, you’ve got me mixed up with someone <br />
else.”  Adrian stepped back...minus the stutter and social awkwardness, he sounded like Patrick.  <br />
Just...bigger.  Everything about Patrick had grown in the past few months since Dan ordered his pups to push <br />
themselves larger.  Patrick would probably be a world-level powerlifter as his new size if he still competed.<br />
<br />
“Now, if you’ll excuse me, my Master is waiting.”  Patrick strode past, barely acknowledging Adrian.  The last <br />
thing Adrian saw was Dan’s mark, clearly adorning Patrick’s massive rump as the red headed bull walked off.<br />
<br />
It had clicked with Adrian. This is what you get for befriending redheads at college, they all eventually <br />
leave you and forget about you when they find their Masters. It was a bitter pill for Adrian to swallow, he <br />
had always liked Patrick but had never had it expressed to him. Now mentally, he belonged to someone else - <br />
his mind, his body, even his noticeable odour changed. Patrick, if that was even his name was name any more, <br />
was gone.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Patrick lumbered his way to the nearby powerlifting gym around the corner from his apartment. He <br />
was to convene with Angus for another powerlifting lesson. Because Angus was still in chastity, he was still <br />
forbidden to wear clothes, but keeping with the gym’s rules Dan allowed him to wear shoes when doing training.</p>
