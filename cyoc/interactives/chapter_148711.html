<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No...I&#39;m not going back to bein&#39; little!<br />
Josh chucked the console in the garbage just as the garbage truck was a few houses down. He smiled. He was so excited. He was going to be the big brother from now on and Joe wasn&#39;t! He was gonna be bigger for keeps! He was so happy when he came back into the house. It was like walking on stilts! His new legs and body were so great. They were filled out with muscle and he felt powerful walking around. He loved the way his muscles moved. He loved how they shook when he moved, how they tensed all around him and hugged his frame. He felt big. He felt important. He liked the fact that the doorframe was only 2 inches above his head now! He could look down on everybody now! <br />
<br />
&quot;So, Joe. How are we going to get the console fixed? It&#39;s hella old. We&#39;d need to find a repair shop. Why don&#39;t you go look online and find a shop that can help us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! Okay, I can do that!&quot; Joe exclaimed and moved his tiny frame (he looked so TINY!) with his little limbs and ran to the computer in his room. Josh smiled. <br />
<br />
Guess who&#39;s gonna keep this body? he thought. He grinned. He checked himself out in the mirror, grinning and shaking his head. He was really muscular! A fit, tall basketball jock with the beginnings of an actual good amount of stubble coming in. I bet in a few years, I can grow a beard! he thought. <br />
<br />
He went outside and stood on the driveway as the dump truck was violently throwing away his and his brother&#39;s only chance at swapping back. The machine shook and returned the garbage bin to its place and Josh waved good-bye to it with a mischievous grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I think I&#39;ve found a place!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How are we gonna get there? I mean...you can&#39;t drive now!&quot; Josh exclaimed, proud of the fact he was tricking his brother. &quot;I mean, you&#39;d have to let me drive!&quot; Josh spread his hands in the air, helplessly. Wonder if he&#39;ll fall for it. <br />
<br />
&quot;No! Absolutely not! You can&#39;t, you could get hurt. Look, we&#39;ll call them and tell them we&#39;ll be in later. We can get an Uber.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit. I didn&#39;t think of that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t swear, Josh. And yes, we can just Uber it over there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I mean...I was trying to stall you. I wanted to wait to see the look on your face after you spent all day thinking we were gonna change back? Guess what? We&#39;re not!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea how this console did it, but we are going to figure out a way to change back!&quot; Joe exclaimed in his now tiny frame, wagging a finger not-so menacingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;No you&#39;re not, cause I threw it in the fucking garbage!&quot; Josh told him back, smugly, crossing his arms. &quot;So whattdya think of that, DUMMY?&quot; Josh came forward quickly and picked Joe off the ground. He screamed in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Put me down! AHHHHH! Put me down!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pipe down!&quot; his old voice told him, clutching him tightly to the side as he was taken into the back laundry room. Josh turned his new littler brother upside down and held him up by his ankles. &quot;You little SHIT. Ha! I can say bad words now. Shrimp. I&#39;m the big brother and I&#39;m going to be RULING you from now on. Like a king. I&#39;ll be your big brother and you better do what I say OR ELSE!&quot; He turned his brother over so he could stand upright. <br />
<br />
Maybe being a shitty big brother wasn&#39;t such a good idea, he suddenly thought, and coughed. His new BIG BROTHER lorded over him, crossing his giant arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH, man! I bet the ladies are gonna go crazy for me!&quot; Josh walked away and sauntered into the nearest bathroom and flicked on a light. He wandered in front of the mirror. He was so handsome now. Chiseled looks, auburn hair, beautiful and manly. He looked a little bit like Caspar Van Dien in Starship Troopers or gay porn models that resemble him. <br />
<br />
Whoa, how did I think of that? I don&#39;t know anything about that movie or that gay porn stuff. Josh thought. He started flexing and preening. He touched his face in the mirror, and pulled at the stubbly skin. He was beautifully tanned and muscled. His coppery-buttery hair shone like a model&#39;s. He grinned. His teeth were perfect, too. What a sexy grin I have! He was enamored with himself, he suddenly realized. Flexing and flexing, his long muscular arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I&#39;m gonna have fun bein you, bro! That game exploding was the best thing that ever happened to me! Look at me! I&#39;m totally an adult now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, you don&#39;t turn 18 for another two months.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares? I look like a superhero now! Geez, no wonder you&#39;re a jerk, I&quot;m like a giant compared with you! You&#39;re like...so short!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry if I was a bad big brother! I&#39;m sorry, okay? I&#39;ll be way nicer to you. I&#39;ll tuck you in at night.&quot; <br />
<br />
Josh looked at him like he was crazy, feeling quite condescended to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, really? Tuck me in? I don&#39;t need to be tucked in! I&#39;m enormous now! And it&#39;s great!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;UGH! We can&#39;t stay like this! I need my body back! Please help me go to the dump to find that console.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK no!&quot; Josh crossed his arms. &quot;I&#39;m not stupid! Even if we do switch back, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna look this fucking perfect! You&#39;re probably not gonna be this tall or muscular. I am gonna rule this place now! I&#39;m gonna go to...I&#39;m gonna...GO TO COLLEGE! AHAHAHAHAHHA! I get to move out and you have to stay here! Oh man, this is the greatest! I get to go be an adult and I&#39;m gonna have sex, and you won&#39;t!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you dare!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna back so many chicks. Maybe some really hot guys, too. Are you bisexual? Wow, this is really gonna be interesting being you. I mean for life. Cuz I&#39;m keeping this body. For keepsies. Bro, we good?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh WELL. Get over it! My body now. And I&#39;m taking MY car out for a drive!&quot; Josh lifted the keys off the wall and twirled them in the air &quot;Hahaha! Loser!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe watched helplessly as his looming giant of a brother opened the door to the garage, turned the door up, and got into the driver&#39;s seat of Joe&#39;s sweet ride, a white Jeep his family had bought him for his 17th birthday! <br />
<br />
Josh was sure he&#39;d seen it done a million times before and he was a good study. He had been watching Youtube videos on driving religiously for over a year now and he was way more interested in cars than his brother ever had been! This was his right! He should be the driver out of the two of them! <br />
<br />
He turned on the ignition, and with the reverse gear backed out slowly, turned onto their suburban street and he was on his way to wherever he wanted to go! HE had total freedom now and his brother didn&#39;t! <br />
<br />
Joe watched helplessly as Josh took off. He followed him after he had got to the driveway thinking he would stop and do the right thing, that he would think better of just taking his Jeep. He thought Josh would be scared to drive, what with just being a little 4 foot tall BOY and all...but he wasn&#39;t! He wasn&#39;t scared. He was a natural! And then when he realized his brother was not shy about using his new tall body to drive, he started to run after him down the street but he couldn&#39;t keep up and soon his brother was zooming on his way to...wherever he was going!</p>
