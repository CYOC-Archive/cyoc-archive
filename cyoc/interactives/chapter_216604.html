<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony managed to wake up before David arrived the next morning and waited expectantly for his second day of getting trained by the younger man. While he waited, he discovered he had grown a third pair of nipples during the night! It was exactly as weird as he&#39;d expected it would be. He now had two pair of nipples on his chest, and one pair way down on his belly. His wide, flat tongue had also lengthened to a certain extent during the night, and his nose had grown a little more, so now he could finally lick his nostrils if he wanted to. This was fascinating to him and he soon learned to enjoy the way it allowed him to detect more scents. Not to mention the way it let him smell the residue of last night&#39;s meal of turkey on his tongue. He couldn&#39;t wait to find out what he would be eating today!<br />
<br />
This time, when David entered the building, Tony was already out in the hallway to greet him, because Tony had smelled him ahead of time. David called him a good boy for being so ready to go, and Tony excitedly asked David what they would be doing that day aside from whatever they&#39;d done yesterday. David said it would be a surprise. Tony barely even noticed the little tip of his spine wiggling because it was now a perfectly normal reaction to him whenever he became excited. He did notice the little nub down there stop twitching when David reached in and grabbed the pooper scooper again like he&#39;d done the day before. Tony looked at the nearby bathroom door with some melancholy, realizing he was still perfectly capable of using it and that every day might be his last chance. He decided it was much too late for that, though. Any remaining dignity he&#39;d been holding onto in front of David had been forfeited yesterday morning. He could trust David to do the things for him that a human would do for himself.<br />
<br />
As the two men exited the front door of the temporary housing building, Tony stopped immediately at the bush he had marked the night before. He sniffed it proudly and then marked it again. He made sure to leave some fluid in his bladder so he could mark the tree on the training field again and hopefully find out who else might have marked the same tree after he had. He was really getting the hang of leaving his scent in places where he wanted it to go!<br />
<br />
No longer having anything to hide in front of David (or anyone else who might have seen him from inside the Illusia Kennels offices), Tony unceremoniously dropped to a squat and deposited his morning load in the way that would become his new normal. He immediately circled around, licks his nosed, and sniffed it furiously. He went so far as to allow himself a small moment of unspeakable pride at what had come out of him. It was like a diary of everything that had gone into him, and he was happy to smell that his health status was improving. David was as professional about the whole thing as he&#39;d been the day before, and started him on essentially the same exercise routine as he&#39;d been on before. He practiced some of the commands he&#39;d learned yesterday, and he had still retained most of them. It was the second day of their routine, and Tony was settling into it better than either Tony or David had expected.<br />
<br />
It was later, on the grass, with David petting him and calling him a good boy, that Tony noticed he could feel David&#39;s hand on his back through a thick layer of some kind of hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, quick! Take a picture of my back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay, sure thing I guess, Tony.&quot;<br />
<br />
David whipped out his smart phone, snapped a pic in the camera app, and then brought it around to show Tony, who looked fascinated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was this there yesterday?&quot; Tony asked frantically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not after I left you. Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah I&#39;m just surprised. It&#39;s so short but so, THICK in places back there. You can&#39;t even see my skin right through the middle! And I&#39;m still pretty hairy on either side of my back. Is that normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
David blinked. &quot;Um, yes? Dude, you&#39;re gonna be completely covered in the stuff before it&#39;s over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, yeah, you&#39;re right of course. But, um, why is it jet black? My hair has always been more of a dark brown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, German shepherds normally have very dark hair on their backs. Some people call it a saddle. There might be brown fur elsewhere, but some sheps are just straight black all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
David looked a little concerned and asked, &quot;Surely they did tell you what breed you were becoming, didn&#39;t they? You&#39;ve seen German shepherds before?&quot;<br />
<br />
David finally looked up from the phone and seemed to be gathering his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. What? Oh, yeah, yes, of course, it&#39;s just. Sorry. Sometimes it still surprises me that this is actually happening,&quot; Tony said, seeming to calm himself down just a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it,&quot; said David with a smile. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;ve planned a little field trip after lunch to possibly help you get acclimated. How does that sound, boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony did not have any idea where they were going but could not say no to lunch. He also wondered when the fur would spread to other places than his back and what color it would be once it got there.</p>
