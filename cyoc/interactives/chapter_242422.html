<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan was confused when she said that, but during the time he was confused Pauline managed to get on her bra and underwear and hit it out of the room. Nathan followed as they went into the room that had the naked Madison sleeping on the bed. He shifted around a bit to make sure that he wasn’t getting another erection due to his smoking, hot girlfriend‘s underwear choice, and the naked teenage Madison. Pauline silently bent over until she was next to Madison’s head.<br />
<br />
“Madison? Can you hear me?” Whispered Pauline. Madison groan but she was still asleep but it was a sign that she can hear them. “My goodness it seems you wet yourself. But it’s OK. Don’t you remember the age where it was OK that you wet yourself?” Nathan finally understand what Madison was trying to do, the rooms also allow regression and progression by mire thoughts and concentration however, for this room that part was turned off because he was rooming with the troublesome twos here.<br />
<br />
<i>‘As if that’s gonna work, I mean, I get she thinks that it’s still…What The Hell’</i> Thought Nathan, but then all of a sudden Madison started getting younger before his very eyes. <i>‘This can be right…oh yeah I was briefed on this.’</i> As he remembered talking to a representative of the resort with the principal when he came to visit. Apparently the whole feature of regression and progression by mire thought can be turned off, but can be turned back on if certain conditions such as say Madison or Pauline has progress into adulthood.<br />
<br />
<i>‘I guess I made a mistake on that part.’</i> Nathan thought as he refocus on Madison’s regression. When he refocus on her; Madison was in the early stages of childhood, briefly entered toddlerhood, and finally settling on a baby about a year old. Nathan felt very uncomfortable given the fact that this was once an 18-year-old girl he just recently had sex with. Pauline silently reached out with her arms to pick up the baby Madison however when she did, she let out of gasp.<br />
<br />
Nathan knew that her breast gained a bit of mass while her hips widen a bit and Pauline notice this as she brought Madison close to her and look down. She looked backed up at him and smiled.<br />
<br />
“I guess this means I’m now Madison’s mother. You know what that means, ‘daddy’.” Pauline teased causing Nathan to blush really hard at this. Mostly at the awkwardness that this was once an 18 year-old student that he had sex with and now she’s a baby in this room has decided to make him and Pauline the parents. <br />
<br />
“Don’t be upset, honey. After all, we had to deal with Madison throughout this trip. I think her being this age is the best way to manage that. Don’t you agree?” ask Pauline. Nathan nodded in respond before she continued. “Now please get dressed. I’ll go get Madison diaper and dress before we head to dinner.”<br />
<br />
With that she left for the bathroom, but now before grabbing a diaper, some supplies, and a onesie from Madison‘s bag, which is now turned into a small traveling bag. Nathan was speechless at first, but decided to fall through by heading back to the room that he and Pauline were in and getting dressed.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Madison felt odd as she began to stir from her slumber. At first, it start out as if someone picked her up with ease despite her being 18 years old. She didn’t mind it at first, but then when she felt something rubbing against her crotch, then she noticed something was odd. She wasn’t feeling the feelings that she would normally get if something was rubbing her crotch. With that she finally wake up.<br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed is at the light bulbs, match the light fixtures of the bathroom she saw earlier. Second thing she noticed was that she was laying on top of the counter, which shouldn’t be possible for a girl her size. Finally a gentle hand, with what smells like a baby wipe that was wiping her crotch.<br />
<br />
“Oh are we finally awake Ms. Fuller?” Ask a surprisingly familiar voice. Madison manage to turn her head to the source of the voice, which was surprisingly hard for her. She was met with a surprisingly familiar Asian woman who looked to be in her mid 30s. However, Madison recognized that face from anywhere, despite how mature looking it was.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Pauline?!?’</i> Madison thought and shocked and tried to ask, but all that came out was…“Pa” this older Pauline just giggled.<br />
<br />
“It’s cute that you were calling me a name as associated with men or do you remember who I am?” Ask Pauline, but not waiting for a response. She continued. “However I’m not surprised but impressed that you managed to keep your mental faculties, despite how old you are now. Then again you were very smart in my science class and a bit troublesome. Given that others in your position would have given in.”<br />
<br />
<i>‘What is she talking about?’</i> Thought Madison, and with some effort she turned her head to the other side to look into the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
<i>‘What the fuck!?!’</i> Madison screamed in her mind. Staring back at her in the mirror wasn’t in 18 year-old girls laying on the counter, but a one year-old baby girl being diaper. Madison was very confused, but it allowed Pauline to finish dressing her in a pink onesie. When she was done, Pauline lifted Madison by her armpits up so she was face-to-face with her.<br />
<br />
“I meant with the memories I have taken when we first got to your age, I was surprised that I would be friends with a person like you.” Pauline started.<br />
<br />
<i>‘What is she talking about? We are friends; best friends!’</i> Thought Madison but then she remembered this version of Pauline and a 35-year-old Mr. Cameron regressing before her very eyes until they were 18 years old like her. Madison brush off these thoughts because things weren’t her true memories.<br />
<br />
“I admit I did not expect you to start falling for and banging my boyfriend.” Pauline said.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Can you blame me he was handsome.’</i> Madison thought, even though she recalls having sex with an 18-year-old, Mr. Cameron no matter what her memory said before that, but then she remembers falling asleep.<br />
<br />
“But it’s OK. He made up for it by having sex from 18 years old to 35 years old, to compensate.” Pauline said with a smile.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Oh God he must of trick her somehow!?!’</i> Madison thought as she tried to rationalize what happened.<br />
<br />
“By the way, sorry for tricking you into becoming a baby, but I need you out the way since you’ve definitely have grown an interest in my boyfriend.” Pauline said.<br />
<br />
<i>‘He is mine not yours.!’</i> Madison thought. As Pauline reposition Madison to be cradle in her arms. Before Madison can start crying and protest, a pacifier was placed in her mouth, and she was forced by instinct to start sucking on it. Once they exit it back into the main room, they ran into a 35-year-old, Mr. Cameron dressed in normal attire.<br />
<br />
“Was she well behaved?” Mr. Cameron ask.<br />
<br />
“Yes but she seems to kept her mind at this age if her recognizing you is any indicator.” Pauline answered as she put Madison into Mr. Cameron‘s arms. “Now I’m going to go get dress. Please keep her company.” With that she picked up her suitcase, which seemed to have changed and headed into the bedroom they came out of and close the door then with a click locked it. Mr. Cameron smirk as he looked down at Madison.<br />
<br />
“Surprise you little troublemaker?” Ask Mr. Cameron, which confuse Madison shouldn’t he have mentally regressed when he was first turned into a teenager.<br />
<br />
“Yeah even the principal knows how much of a troublemaker you two were. So with the help at the resort manager, there was an extra precaution added to the teachers. They would not be mentally regress as they went down in age. Sorry you’re a little plan failed but I meant the acting I learned in high school really paid off.” Mr. Cameron said which caused Madison to feel down.<br />
<br />
“You are cute, but redheads are not my type. Asians on the other hand oh boy those are definitely my type, especially the late bloomers like your friend.” Mr. Cameron continued.<br />
<br />
<i>‘YOU CREEPY OLD MAN!’</i> Madison screamed in her mind. However, before she can try to vocal this, a door unlocked and Pauline stepped out wearing something that made Mr. Cameron jaw dropped. Pauline was wearing a split hem dress with a floral pattern and she was smiling at Mr. Cameron’s reaction. She then went around him to seem to set up a baby stroller.<br />
<br />
“Was she well behaved with you?” Pauline asked as she finally set up the stroller just as Mr. Cameron put Madison in a baby carrier then strapped her in.<br />
<br />
“Yes she was so off to dinner then?” Mr. Cameron ask as he handed the baby carrier to Pauline, who put it into the stroller. When that was done, Pauline went up to Mr. Cameron and kissed him on the lips in full view of baby Madison.<br />
<br />
“Yep and don’t worry we’re heading to one of the restaurants that don’t change ages.” Pauline said as they broke the kiss. She then pick up two what look like fob keys for their room and wrap them to their wrist. Finally she got behind the baby stroller and pushed it as Mr. Cameron open up the door.<br />
<br />
<i>“Pauline what is wrong with you?’</i> Madison thought in her head with tears going down her cheeks as they left their room and the door close behind it.<br />
<br />
<b>10 Minutes Later</b><br />
<br />
They reached the restaurant Plaza and entered the restaurant of their choosing. </p>
