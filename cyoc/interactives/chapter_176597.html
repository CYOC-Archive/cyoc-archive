<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick wanted to play with the dicking app himself some more, but he was enjoying having Sam stuck as his penis for a full year. He had always admired Sam’s big cock, especially the way the big thing used to flop around while Nick pounded him from behind. Now it was his big floppy cock, laying limp against his leg. He could feel Sam’s contentment after their last orgasm; he could hear him mulling over the idea of being Nick’s cock, how strangely good it felt to be reduced to his own sex organ. He was eager to show Sam off and see his friends reactions when they saw Sam reduced to nothing but his own cock; maybe they’d even have the balls to try the app themselves. <br />
<br />
He decided to head down the street and visit his friend Joe. He stood up, hearing Sam yelp out a “whoa!” in his mind as Sam’s cock body swayed with each step. Nick headed to his room and reached for a pair of briefs before deciding he and Sam would go commando. He stumbled into a white t-shirt and a pair of jeans. Sam felt weird but cozy as he was pressed between the hairy skin of Nick’s groin and the tight denim. Nick returned to the living room to grab his shoes and his phone. After tying his shoes he texted Joe to let him know he was coming by, and he noticed that the dicking app was still open. Nick saw that there were settings related to his dick, one of them reading “speech” with an empty box. He clicked the box and suddenly a muffled voice spoke out from his crotch.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, that was weird. I felt a click.” Sam said. Nick hastily unbuckled his jeans and pulled his fly down, letting Sam’s long body and big balls spill out.<br />
<br />
“Sam, did you just talk out loud?” Nick asked.<br />
“Well, yeah,” the cock said, twitching slightly but otherwise making no movement that would normally make speech. “Haven’t I been talking aloud this whole time?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“No, I’ve just been hearing your voice in my head.” Nick replied. He looked at the other options, pressing one that said “mute”.<br />
<br />
“That’s weird, it sounded to me like…” but Sam was cut off; Nick suddenly couldn’t hear anything, with his ears or otherwise. His cock lay flaccid and silent between his legs. He pinched his cock, wincing slightly, but still nothing. He unselected “mute” and suddenly Sam’s voice was back.<br />
<br />
“Ow! What was that for?” he said angrily. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, man,” Nick laughed. “You disappeared when I hit mute; I had to check.”<br />
<br />
“You muted me? So weird, I thought I was still talking.” He said.<br />
<br />
“Nice to know. I’m heading to Joe’s place to show him this app. And maybe also to show him my new toy,” said Nick, giving Sam’s shaft and balls a pleasant squeeze. He zipped Sam back up into his pants, grabbed his keys, and stepped out the door.<br />
<br />
His buddy Joe lived a few blocks away, in a rental. They had worked together at a kitchen job a few years ago. Nick still bought weed from Joe on the regular, and considered him a fun and chill guy to hang out with. Joe would probably get a kick out of the app.<br />
<br />
He arrived at Joes house and crossed the unkempt yard to the front door. He knocked, but a voice shouted that the door was open. Nick stepped inside and kicked off his shoes, heading for the living room at the other end of the house. Joe was there, kneeling in front of a coffee table and delicately rolling a joint. He looked up and gave Nick a toothy smile through his scraggly beard.<br />
<br />
“Nick, what’s up man? I rolled one up since you said you were coming over. Its been a minute man,” Joe said, returning to his work.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, man. I know its my day off…” and they shot the shit for a half hour while they lit the joint and passed it between them. Just when Jim was starting to get thoroughly baked, he asked where Sam was.<br />
<br />
Nick smiled, feeling Sam harden in his pants; his mind was hazy from the weed as well. “Oh, he’s been hanging around.”<br />
<br />
“He gonna drop by and kick it with us?” Joe asked. <br />
<br />
“I might be able to convince him to come out. But first, I gotta ask: have you heard anything about this ‘dicking’ phenomenon?” Nick asked.<br />
<br />
Joe thought about it for a moment. “My brother told me some stories about this college he visited where he said guys were volunteering to be turned into dicks or something, but I thought that was just some dumb frat joke he learned.”<br />
<br />
“No way, man. Its real! There’s an app for it and everything,” said Nick.<br />
<br />
Joe shook his head and laughed. “You’ve been smoking better shit than I have, my friend.”<br />
<br />
“No, man, its true. I’ve tried it a few times, and I even got Sam to try it for a while,” he smirked. Sam stirred some more and began listening in.<br />
<br />
“Show me this app, man. You’re fucking with me.” and Nick opened the dicking roulette app and showed it to him. Joe read the status on the screen, seeing that Sam and Nick’s stats.<br />
<br />
“This for real?” he asked, looking up from the phone. “I didn’t know Sam was hung. And it says…wait, where did you say Sam was again?”<br />
<br />
Nick grinned, “Right here,” he said, pointing to his crotch.<br />
<br />
“If this is some joke, man…”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m serious. In fact, I’ll let Sam show you himself.” He said, unbuckling his belt and unzipping himself. Sam ad already grown almost fully hard at the excitement of showing himself. Joe looked away for a second, but then tentatively started to turn his head back. He had never seen Sam’s cock, but being drinking buddies with Nick they had both seen each other’s junk plenty of times on a joke. Nick was a respectable seven inches, but Joe’s cock, like Sams, was an inch longer and thicker. This cock hanging from Nick’s crotch Joe didn’t recognize. The skin tone of the cock seemed slightly different than Nick’s skin, but that was normal too, right? And the balls; they were a lot bigger than Nick’s old set. Finally, the cock spoke to him.<br />
<br />
“What’s up, Joe? Wanna pass me that joint?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” shouted Joe, moving away from the erect, talking cock. “That you, Sam?”<br />
<br />
“Yup! I thought it kind of sucked at first, but now I kind of like being a cock.” He said.<br />
<br />
“Shit its real? But how?” asked Joe.<br />
<br />
“Download the app and you can try. I’ll show you.” In a minute Joe had downloaded the app on his own and had fired it up. After setting it up for a solo round, Joe sat there on the couch, his phone in his hand and his finger hovering over the touch screen start button that would apparently turn him into his own cock. If this wasn’t some elaborate joke.<br />
<br />
“I dunno, man. Its getting kind of, real,” Joe said.<br />
<br />
“C’mon man! I did it for a whole day once! It feels awesome. Trust me.” Nick promised.<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute,” Joe said. He lit the joint he finished rolling and took a long, deep drag, letting out a thick cloud of smoke before saying “Alright. Lets do this.” and hitting the button. <br />
<br />
The little wheel spun around in circles as a series of numbers and words scrolled across the screen. Nick and Joe watched intently as the numbers and words slowed down, gradually coming to a stop at the number ‘20’ and the word ‘minutes’. A little timer started counting down from fifteen seconds.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so I’m going to be my own dick for 20 minutes?” Joe asked uncertainly.<br />
<br />
“It seems so. You got lucky; Sam here is stuck as my cock for an entire year!” Nick laughed.<br />
“Wait, what?” but Joe was cut of by a sharp ring and a blinding flash. When his vision came to, he saw that it was as if he’d collapsed in a pile of blankets. He tried to move his arms or legs to free himself, but nothing moved; he couldn’t feel them. What he could feel, however, was a heavy, churning wait pulling from his lower body. He could feel his chest and abdomen pulse and shake with his heartbeat, and the fabric rubbing against his head and body felt stimulating to every inch of skin they touched. That’s when Joe realized, it was real! He had been turned into his own eight inch cock. <br />
He felt a rough hand dig through the pile of clothes and extract his shrunken self, holding Joe from his balls. Joe saw Nick’s smiling face, and watched his view shift as Nick held him in both hands and began too rub and stroke his body. It felt too good, the feeling of Nick’s strong hands rubbing his body. Joe felt himself grow harder and harder until he was fully hard, his balls churning in Nick’s hands. Nick brought Joe down to his crotch and held him next to Sam to compare. They were pretty much the same length; Sam’s balls were bigger but Joe’s shaft had a thicker girth. He mashed the two cocks together, hearing Joe and Sam moan at the sensation.<br />
<br />
“How does it feel, Joe,” asked Sam, looking over at Joe’s bulbous purple cockhead. <br />
<br />
“You guys were right. It feels amazing! Sam are you really stuck like this for a year?” Joe asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I’m making peace with it. My life will be on hold for me, and being Nick’s cock is a lot of fun. I think we’re gonna have fun together.” Sam said happily.<br />
<br />
“Yes, we are, Sammy,” growled Nick as he started stroking the cock’s together. <br />
<br />
“That feels so good,” said Joe. “Dude, you gotta make me come before I turn back. Please?” he begged. Nick looked at the screen, he had about 15 minutes to go. “Man, I wish my girlfriend was here. She’d have some kinky ideas,” Joe said, trying to grin before remembering he was a cock; he couldn’t grin.<br />
<br />
“I got kinky ideas too, buddy.” Said Nick. He kept stroking Sam with one hand and lifted Joe to his mouth with the other. He tenderly inserted Joe’s bulbous cock into his mouth, licking and massaging the big cock with hi tongue as he slid him in and out of his mouth. Joe was in ecstasy; he had his share of blow jobs but this was something else. With his body reduced to just a cock, the sensations felt magnified ten-fold against the sensitive skin of his shaft and glans. Joe shouted “deeper” and Nick obliged, gripping the dicked-man’s balls and pushing him deeper down his throat. Nick continued to throat-fuck himself with Joe, while jerking his dick, or Sam, as he had to remember. Soon, he heard joe mutter in the back of his mind, “Its coming, I hope you don’t mind swallowing!” Nick felt Joe’s balls clench in his hands as the dick throbbed and came down his throat. The thought of the dicked man coming down Nick’s throat put Sam over the edge, and they both groaned as they came forcefully all over the carpet. Nick was in such a daze that he didn’t even notice Joe’s phone beep like a kitchen timer, until a pair of hands resting around Nick’s head woke him from his stupor. Joe the man withdrew his spent cock from Nick’s mouth and collapsed on the couch naked, his hairy chest heaving heavily.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, that was amazing.” He said, grabbing his phone and checking the app.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” asked Nick, seating himself on the ground to rest. <br />
“What do you think I’m doing?” Joe asked incredulously, tapping the screen of his phone. “I’m going again. Awe, shit! Six hours! Might as well just take me over to your place, bro. This is gonna be an all-nighter.” And with a flash Joe was a thick and happy cock laying on the couch.</p>
