<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still buck-naked, I stood there, holding Steph and Michelle in my hand. They were no larger than geckos, but not nearly as slimy or even as strong. Nevertheless, as I quietly thought about what to do with them, they started wriggling as much as their diminished bodies would let them, desperately trying to free themselves from my fists. After a light squeeze and a few pained cries, they stopped struggling and looked up at me, fear evident in their beady little eyes. After a few moments of trembling silence, Steph began to plea with her trembling and comically miniscule voice. Michelle joined in as well, but they both their squeaks died off when they realized I wasn&#39;t listening. Eventually, they returned to shivering in fear, passing glances to each other every now and then but mostly looking up at me. They truly were pathetic now, both in body and will. An idea crossed my mind. He couldn&#39;t keep them small and diminished like this forever, but a smaller body and weaker will sounded like a perfect punishment for two high and mighty dragons.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you two did wasn&#39;t very nice,&quot; I said simply, &quot;but I know a good punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe! Please,&quot; Michelle cried out, &quot;don&#39;t hurt us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurt you? I&#39;m not a killer,&quot; I said with a small grin, &quot;unlike two snakes I know.&quot; I knew I got to them, since their wills were too weak not to look away in shame. Confident, I continued, &quot;as a matter of fact, you&#39;re going to love me after this.&quot; They snapped their flimsy heads back at me and let out two very confused noises. &quot;Of course, you&#39;ll never be true dragons again. I can&#39;t risk that.&quot; This did nothing to quell their confusion, unable to grasp anything other than being dragons to be something they would love him for. A quick chuckle, and I squeezed them again just as lightly. Steph and Michelle quickly swallowed their confusion continued to stare at me in fear.<br />
<br />
Calmly, quietly, in nudity, I dropped a simple question, &quot;are you two ladies familiar with kobolds?&quot; Their reaction was immediate. Somehow, both of their grey ashy faces grew even paler. Of course, both Steph and Michelle knew what Kobolds were; what kind of dragon wouldn&#39;t know about an entire species devoted to them?<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Steph cried out, &quot;Not that! I refuse to be brought so low!&quot; She kicked the inside of my hand as hard as her thin legs could in denial, her incredulity momentarily giving her energy. Michelle didn&#39;t share in the excitement, simply holding her bony claws over her stubby snout in a mild gloom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, right now is the lowest you&#39;ll ever be,&quot; I said, giving one final rattle, no stronger than a hand-shake. Even still, they called out in discomfort. &quot;Because I wish both of you would become my loyal and extremely frisky kobold lovers.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both dragonettes gasped at the wish, and once again began wiggling as hard as they could in my hand, trying to break free. Instead of shaking them this time, I gave them their own wish and dropped them. With another shriek, they both tumbled to the floor at my feet. Steph managed to land on all fours and bounded away in the opposite direction, but Michelle fell square on her back. Before Steph could get more than a few feet, the wish took hold and changes racked their forms. <br />
 <br />
Spindly and thin, Michelle&#39;s body began rapidly growing back from her doll-sized height. Michelle&#39;s pathetic soot looking scales started to return to their previous gleaming black shine, but stopped suddenly. Instead they seemed content to develop into a plain looking matte black. They also stopped short of their previous and elegant tear-drop shape, settling on a less ornate, but functional gardening spade-shaped scale. Instead of growing back her full head of hair, which they both lost when they were reduced, Michelle&#39;s little nub horns grew out until they were about three inches tall before they split off into a second pair of horns right behind, half as long. In turn, that pair split off again, which did the same until the last pair were just simple bony nubs. Following the same theme, they were not spectacularly white as before, but just a plain bone color.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Steph whined meekly at her own changes, sitting up as she felt the heat of change. She had been growing larger, like Steph, and was just below my knees at her current sitting height. The nubs on her head disappeared completely, Instead, her new, white scales-- which settled a plain, eggshell white-- bunched together until two ridges formed above her eyes and proceeded to cascade across the top of her scalp before ending in points facing behind her, which merely imitated luxurious dragon horns. As she continued to sit, she reached up to feel them with a trembling claw.  She was facing away, her sitting height seemed to stop just below my groin. Her tail pushed out again like before, its skinny form plumping up to a point where it perhaps looked just a bit too short and a bit too fatty, in proportions unfit for a dragon, but perfect for a kobold. Slowly, her claws transitioned to her tail area, which lost a digit leaving her with three claws and a thumb, to feel the base of her tail. Just like before, they trembled at the touch. Suddenly, she craned her head up to snarl at me with her still somewhat stubby, kobold snout. Her white teeth complementing her egg-white scales and her iris-less white eyes, which were teary. Her new, scaly eye-ridges were furrowed, showing her anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bastard!&quot; the kobold-like Steph shouted before she jumped up and twirled from her haunches and fell towards me. Legs stretched out, she was almost five feet, but that didn&#39;t stop her from trying to look menacing as she reared her four-digit claws at me and snarled again with her slightly rounded fang teeth. I prepared to push back when her legs failed her completely. As she fell to her knees, they plumped up.  As they grew into wide hips, chubby like her tail, she was suddenly face to face with my junk. Her snarls became confused and eventually silent as it seemed to catch her attention. Instead of getting back up, she started sniffing heavily for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steph, don&#39;t...&quot;  Michelle said in exasperation, transitioning from all fours to her knees. Like Steph, she had grown her own short, slightly chubby tail; her own four-digit claws;  plump, scaly hips, and all the other things that made a kobold a kobold. However, as she groaned a bit more as a small pair of wings, black as the rest of her scales, wrestled themselves back onto her back. They were clearly too small for any form of real flight, but perhaps they were feasible gliders on a good day. Either way, the effort on her back seemed to be more pleasurable tha she expected. She let her head hang down, not ashamed to let her purple, serpentine tongue hang out to reflect her pleasure. As she faced away from me, her shame was on fully display, which also served as a good, perhaps better indicator of her pleasure and arousal. Not black like the rest of her, but purplish like her tongue, it stood well against her scales. Eventually she realized she was being watched and she craned her head down, looking across her chest, past her lips making eye-contact with me. Unobstructed by breasts-- neither kobold woman had regrown any-- I could see her eyes, purple. Like Steph, they possessed no irises, but could I could still they were looking right at me. She stared, silent.  In the quiet intensity of her staring, the increasing arousal she became more and more evident as she made no effort to hide the increasing wetness of her hind-quarters.  Suddenly, and surprisingly, Michelle gave out another moan as small ridges, the scales a splotchy purple, popped out from her forehead in-between her horns. It continued down the middle of her back and through her wings before trailing off as they reached the tip of her tail. As those final changes died down, she seemed to smile as she dropped to her elbows and lifted her tail more than it had already, making it look like she was presenting herself. I gave a smile back, happy that the mental changes had changed Michelle so dramatically from her earlier, teasing attitude. Just then, a warm wetness against my member. I snapped down, and let my smile get bigger. Steph remained on her knees, leaning against my crotch. The white kobold had her pink, long, and serpentine tongue liberally tasting me, her clear white-eyes looking at me, questioning if she could go further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say the word, love.&quot; Steph hummed. It sounded somewhat garbled with her tongue preoccupied, but the message was clear. I smiled as I looked her over. She was unmistakably a kobold. Like Michelle had one final change, she herself had grown small stubby, pointed ears. Thinking about Michelle again, I looked back at her only to find that her arousal was too much for her, her claws reaching underneath to toy with her outer edges. She moaned quietly, maybe enjoying the combination of her claws and the cold air of the apartment.<br />
<br />
As I congratulated myself on a good wish, I started to wonder which of the two kobolds I should experiment with first. Steph already had her tongue on me, but Michelle&#39;s quiet moaning was hard to ignore. They were indeed very frisky, as I had wished for. I wondered on what, or who, I should do.</p>
