<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Aidan stopped his tantrum about being changed back a few minutes later, Mark finally could make his adjustments to Aidan. “Okay Aidan, you want this to end, so I will give you that. As you already have your dick in that place, let us adjust that. Aidan, your cock will grow into your new head, featuring the monkey features the rest of your body is already shaped after, instead of your human ones. Your balls will be sucked inside this new head and become the brain it will need to function. And your ass will vanish, turning into normal shoulder muscles.”<br />
Aidan looked horrified at that thought. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT´S NOT CHANGING ME BACK TO NORMAL. I …” any further comment Aidan wanted to scream was turned into a pleasured moaning as his cock started to grow.<br />
Before Mark´s eyes, Aidan´s cock-head swelled bigger and rounder. While the shaft itself thickened into a new neck, the head grew into just that, a real head. Out of the ball-shaped head grew two big round monkey-ears, a new set of eyes developed themselves above the still existent former piss-hole. Said hole formed into Aidan´s new heads mouth, with a wide nose forming above it. What was curios to any watcher but Mark, who wanted it that way, was that the head faced the wrong way on the body.<br />
With a load moan in pleasure, Aidan commented in a way as his balls were sucked in with a slurping noise, while the new head was framed in dark-brown monkey fur. It covered its back and sides, around the eyes, and thickened a bit around the neck. With a sucking sound Aidan´s ass closed itself before flattening back into Aidan´s back, no way to tell it used to be his ass.<br />
Now Aidan looked like a monkey, but with his human head still between his legs, facing backwards. The only feature on it not normal to a human was the monkey tail sprouting for his forehead.<br />
Mark laughed at Aidan´s situation. Aidan couldn´t stop his moaning for some time, still in a pleasured high from his cock growing into shape. His old cum, by now, had become his new knowledge inside his former balls, now new brain. It wasn´t as developed as his human mind, seeing as it was a monkey´s brain, but still was far more intelligent than a normal monkey would be. After all, Mark wanted a clever pet, not a dumb one.<br />
When Aidan finally collected himself enough to not moan the whole time, he was assaulted by his new senses. The new heads eyes send another view to Aidan, the nose was much more sensible than his human one, and his hearing on those ears was better as well. What wasn´t nice but disgusting to Aidan was the taste inside the new mouth, as he could taste the piss still lingering inside.<br />
Before Aidan could again raise protest, Mark decided to finish his little pet monkey. “Aidan, now that you are a monkey beside your old head, let´s finish this. As a monkey, you will need to be smaller than now, so your body will shrink to about half its size. Your limbs will turn around so they are of use for your new head, as right now the face the wrong way. And then, finally, your human head will sink back into your body. Your nose will be moved to the other side of your head and grew into your new monkey-cock, your brain will emerge beneath it and form into your new balls, and, as your tail is on your forehead right now, your mouth will become your new ass crack.”<br />
“NOOO MARK STOP THIS. I´M NOT Your pet or a monke…” Aidan screamed, but got quieter as he spoke. His mouth stopped working, hindering his speaking. Adding to that was his now vanished voice box, leaving him mute. <br />
His body was shrinking and rearranging itself. His nose moved and grew longer, as his nostrils merged into a single passage, forming his new cock. His ears were sucked away, as his mouth grew bigger, but vertical. It split his old face that way, and pushed his eyes apart, until it stopped beneath his tail. Said eyes, wide in panic, slowly closed and vanished from his newly grown ass checks, leaving the old head senseless beside the increased sensibility of his former nose.<br />
The last change Mark could watch were Aidan´s newly growing balls, bigger than his original ones, just underneath his new cock.<br />
Aidan felt his mind growing simpler as his brain stopped being that, and his mind and memories slowly liquefied inside their new home as cum. His new brain started to work fully now, but was much simpler, so Aidan was simpler and somewhat dumber than before. The monkey moaned, being extremely horny now.<br />
Mark had watched all this fascinated, and had one final point to make sure of now. Erasing the last of Aidan´s old mind was important, or he could theoretically return later. With an evil but excited grin, Mark said: “Now then, Aidan, at last you are my pet monkey. But to make sure you never turn back the way you were before, when I suck you off now, my little horny monkey, you will blast out all that memory filled cum. And with each memory leaving you, you will feel better, and will grow more loyal and loving to me, your master.” After saying that, Mark bend down and took the fully erect monkey cock inside his mouth while also massaging his balls slowly.<br />
The part of Aidan that still was there remembering screamed for Mark to stop this madness, but it grew quieter due the receiving pleasure. In merely seconds, the monkey started to shot his cum into Mark´s mouth, and with it, everything calmed inside Aidan´s mind. A growing fondness and loyalty and love came to be towards his master, erasing anything else that Aidan had against Mark before.<br />
Mark dutifully swallowed all the cum his monkey pet shot out, even smiling evilly around the cock. In some way, he could hear the human Aidan scream inside the cum, as more and more of it went down into his stomach.   <br />
After nearly two minutes of cumming, the monkey tipped over forwards and onto Mark´s head, as beside his now relieved balls it also was quite tired, soon falling asleep on his master.<br />
Mark slowly raised up again, carefully taking his pet into his arms, stroking its fur. “Now you are truly my pet, Aidan. I will even let you keep that name, a last remainder of who you used to be.” He turned to the laptop, opened the chronivac and edited a few things. Aidan Starns never existed, everything owned by him was now Mark´s. His monkey pet Aidan had been there for years, and it would be normal for every one that Aidan accompanied him everywhere, and him showing some affection to his pet as well. After all, he didn´t change Aidan only for fun, but also to satisfy his wish for him to be his. <br />
With all that finished, Mark closed the laptop, packed it, and left with it and the sleeping monkey in his arms. Aidan´s former, now his flat, would be some kind of secret retreat for him and his pet, completely free of charge.<br />
At the same time, what was left of Aidan´s human being was slowly but painfully eaten away by Mark´s stomach acid, leaving nothing behind of Aidan Starns. Really like he never existed. And the monkey wouldn´t remember his human life, ever being a monkey.</p>
