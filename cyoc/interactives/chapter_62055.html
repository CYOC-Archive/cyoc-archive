<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam paced his room in his parent’s house nervously.   He had dropped his friend Mathew off at a strange clothing store earlier and hadn’t heard from him since.  He was supposed to call for a ride home but it had been over an hour.  Mathew and Adam had been friends since elementary school, they were huge nerds but together they fought beasts in WoW on the weekends and together put up with wedgies, trips and taunts during the week at school.  Adam stared in his mirror with a hint of self-doubt for not the first time.  While Mathew was slightly chubby, Adam was meek, short and skinny.  His ghost like complexion and Mickey Mouse voice didn’t win him any points with the ladies he so desired either.  <br />
After another ten minutes of idly flipping through comic books to hide his worry for his one and only friend Adam picked up the phone and called Mathew.  The phone rang, and rang and just as Adam was about to give up hope he heard the familiar click of someone answering… “Hello?  Hello?  Mathew, are you there, are you alright?”  Adam grew worried as he heard nothing but unfamiliar voices whispering in the background, both sounded like teens but none he knew and one was slightly higher than the other.  “This isn’t funny, who’s there and where is Mathew?”  Adam felt an uncustomary flow of adrenaline giving him courage he never had before.  <br />
Silence.  Finally he heard both voices shout ‘Dude’ into the phone before hanging up.  Adam was shocked, then stumbled, feeling weary as if drugged.  He took a step forward and nearly fell, dropping his phone to the ground as a strange energy engulfed him and radiated from him to consume his room.  His eyes widened and nearly popped out of his skull as he watched most of his room light up with blue fire.  He covered his face but was helpless to do anymore as tired as he felt.  But he wasn’t burned, not even singed, the fire felt uplifting not hot.  As he watched the cool flames swallowed his comic book collection and as they burned they reformed into a brand new white and blue surf board.  He cried aloud at the loss of his priceless collection but the flames danced around, changing everything before he could save anything of his soon to be old life.  His clothes all became polos, board shorts and sandals in gigantic sizes that he never dreamed of filling.  His walls became the same, calming light blue as his book shelves lost all their books but gained surfing magazines and catalogs filled with surfing chicks in bikinis.  His brand new, top of the line gaming pc became an older model, fit for the occasional IM or email but he wouldn’t be wasting his life on their playing games anymore.  <br />
As the flames spread throughout the house Adam collapsed to the ground, groaning as the changes overcame him.  <br />
“What’s happening to me?”  He watched in fear as his small, white hand contorted and slowly bulged out, bigger and bigger.  The skin darkened, past a tan to a beautiful natural darkness that only comes from genes.  Small black hairs appeared one by one on his hand and spread out over his growing fingers, he opened and closed his gigantic fist both impressed and frightened out of his mind.  He screamed as he looked at his other hand and saw it was exactly the same, the veins suddenly doubling in size and snaking out across his arms which jerked and flailed on their own.  As they waved uncontrollably they grew in length and girth to massive proportions, the kind of arms that tear sleeves off shirts and pop out of wife beaters to awe and inspired without even flexing.  The biceps were tremendous mountains that popped out with force with the slightest effort.  The young nerd was speechless at the weapons he now wielded.  They just kept growing, darkening to the same brilliant brown as his hands and equally as hairy as the jet black hairs overtook them.  His shirt was in shatters but as he watched all of his clothes vanished into ash which soon disappeared as well leaving him thrashing on the ground naked, quickly becoming a Hawaiian-American surfer hunk.  His chest seized up, Adam taking deep breaths as his lungs grew to inhale larger breathes, he remembered being on swim and dive team through high school.  But wait, he was 16 he was still in high school?  His mind was a war zone between the college stud who had done it all and done everyone and high school nerd that was losing control.  His now hazel eyes glazed over as a deluge of new thought and memories washed away his once infamous IQ leaving him nearly stupid, the dumbest of the three surfers so far but also the biggest and best surfer out of everyone he knew.  His chest heaved and pulsed, each breath inflating his balloon like pecs more and more until they bounced with young, titanic muscle with each shudder of his body.  The dark, round nipples hanging there, begging Adam to touch himself, to accept the great life his friend had given him but he tried to resist even as the pleasure wiped out everything else.  Dark hairs sprouted around his nipples, in the center of his chest, from his pits and in a thick treasure trail covering his belly, for a split second Adam could still see his ribs before the muscle growth reached his mid region and a brick wall like 8 pack appeared with a blue sunburst tattoo around his naval.  He groaned, his voice rapidly descending to a deep but equally rich and accented rumble as his equipment became monstrous.  As if on cue his feet suddenly sprouted across the floor, in both directions, becoming a scary size 16 that was appropriate as his swelling legs brought him to a towering 6”4.  His dark tree trunks sprouted a mass of black hairs that traveled down to his larger feet.  By now, the old Adam was gone and the new, dumb but friendly surfer Adam was loving every second of this.  He stood up slowly, nearly hitting his head on the ceiling fan and as he walked through his changed room he watched in the mirror as his face underwent the final change.  It became as dark as the rest of him with mysterious eyes and the same killer smile as his friends.  His jaw became square and masculine but with some boyish qualities remaining.  Dark stubble grew along it creating a thick and permanent 5’ o clock shadow.  And lastly his hair fell to his shoulders in dark, thick locks that became slightly curly; a massive forest of dark hair that no comb could ever hope to tame.  With a last smile at the god in the mirror he bellowed “sweet dude!”</p>
