Ideas by Drakkenfyre, holyinsurgent, salvador145, peteroo6 and scriptboy<br />
<br />
The kids ran back to Ty and Peter’s house, banging on their front door. When Ty opened up, he found himself faced with an angry group of kids, who were all shouting and crying at the same time!<br />
<br />
“Alright now, one at a time! What happened?” Ty shouted. “What’s going on?” Peter asked, as he walked up to Ty when he heard the commotion. Ryan, Dustin and Prince quickly joined Ty in the living room, where they allowed the band of dressed up kids to get in.<br />
<br />
One kid came forward out of the whole group. He was about 5ft7” tall, he had chocolate brown skin, and he had short, straight black hair and brown eyes. Peter sensed that he was the oldest in the group; he was a Hispanic boy who had just turned thirteen years old. <br />
<br />
“They are a bunch of ladrones! These four big kids took our bag of candy away from us!” the brown boy shouted. He was clearly upset, and he wanted to get it back. “Well, we’ll see about that! I will go after them and turn them into mice!” Ty said angrily. <br />
<br />
“Wait a minute!” Peter began, “They didn’t steal the candy from us! We gave it to them! It’s not our candy, it belonged to these kids!” Ty looked at him with a confused look on his face. “What are you saying? We can’t help them?” he asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think we should get involved in this. It’s not our candy that was stolen!” Peter responded. The Hispanic boy walked up to Peter. “Are you Peter? My name is Salvador. I live right down the street and I was with the group when the candy was taken away by those high school jocks, I saw them and I know what they look like. I will get the candy back from them. All I want from you is your help!” he said to Peter.<br />
<br />
“My help? What do you mean?” Peter asked him. “I know who you are and I have heard about your magic! Give me some of your magical powers and I will use them to get the candy back from the jocks!” Salvador answered, giving Peter a very serious look.<br />
<br />
“What? You don’t know what you’re asking!” Peter replied. Just at that moment Prince came forward and tapped Peter on his shoulder. “The hour has come for you to rise up and to begin assembling your group of Transformation Wizards so that you will not have to face the Dark Wizards alone!” Prince said calmly. Peter turned to Prince with confusion all over his face.<br />
<br />
“But Master, what are you saying? I should pass my powers on to this kid? He is only thirteen years old! He wouldn’t know how to weld such power!” Peter responded. Prince stood right in front of him and placed his hands on Peter’s shoulders. “Things aren’t always how they seem before your eyes, my apprentice. This youngster will one day be your most loyal follower, and he will soon be calling you his ‘Master’. The time has come for you to teach others how to use these powers of transforming people and objects. We all need to be instructed at one point in our lives. We are all students, and we grow through our mistakes and our experiences, until we get called to become teachers. Then the cycle starts all over again, and our students will one day become teachers as well. Peter, this is your calling.”<br />
<br />
Peter bowed his head and closed his eyes. “I don’t know if I can do this, Master. I don’t think I’m ready to teach others how to use their powers yet…” he whispered. Prince grinned, as he placed his hand on Peter’s cheek, lifting it up so he was looking him straight in the eye. “Peter, Peter… Have you forgotten who you are and where you came from? I need you now, Peter. You can’t protect us from the Dark Wizards alone! Have you forgotten your powers? You are my most powerful transformation Wizard! I would not allow this to happen if you were not ready for it. It’s time for others to look up to you and to call you their ‘Master’. Salvador will be your loyal apprentice and you will coach him and guide him. I believe in you, Peter. You will succeed, for I have seen it in your future. It is your destiny!” Prince whispered, smiling as he looked down on his student.<br />
<br />
“Shall I give him some of my powers, Master?” Peter asked Prince. “Yes, you can restrict them so he can only use them when he is with you. You will coach him and he will obey you, for one day many wizards will turn against us, but Salvador will always be with you!” Prince replied.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for believing in me, Master. I will always do what you say and I will always be your loyal servant!” Peter replied, with a smile on his face while a tear rolled from his eye. “I know, Peter. I know. Here comes your first opportunity to be the ‘Master’. Hurry, the boy is waiting for you. Give him his powers and instruct him telepathically as he goes on his first mission. The children will receive their candy, but you will gain something far greater. You will gain a friendship that will last forever!” Prince whispered.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master!” Peter replied calmly, feeling more confident now. Peter turned around and walked up to Salvador, who was dressed in a long blue robe with small yellow starts printed on it. He wore a pointy hat, and he was obviously supposed to look like a wizard. <br />
<br />
“Alright, Salvador! Are you ready to get your candy back?” Peter asked the boy, as he looked him straight in the eyes. “Yes, I want to do this. Please help me with this, for I don’t know how to use magic and I want to learn!” the boy responded with a big smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Peter walked closer to Salvador and placed his right hand over the boy’s forehead. Then he closed his eyes and concentrated. About ten seconds later Salvador’s costumed changed, to where he was now wearing white boots, white long slacks and a white robe, which was held in place by a white belt. He suddenly wore a white headband over his brown forehead! Peter pulled his hand back and looked down at the youngster, who had just opened his brown eyes. He looked at his robe and suddenly understood what had happened. The thirteen year-old teenager was transformed into a mighty wizard with transformation powers!<br />
<br />
“You want to be a wizard, Salvador? Well guess what: Now you really are a wizard! You will only be able to use your powers when you are within a hundred feet of me or when we are in contact telepathically. This restriction will go away once you know how to use your powers!” Peter said, looking at his new apprentice.<br />
<br />
“Wow! This is awesome! I feel different; I can hear voices when I look at you! I’m just like you!” Salvador responded, feeling excited about being a wizard. Peter still communicated with the boy, but without opening his mouth. The brown boy had gained psychic powers, and he received Peter’s thoughts loud and clear. <br />
<br />
Salvador walked by his friends and then walked out the front door. “Alright Salvador! Go get us our candy back!” the kids said, cheering him on. The whole group stood out on the lawn in front of Dustin’s house and waited. Only Peter knew where Salvador was and what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Salvador first concentrated on where the four jocks had gone, and found out that they were walking down the street, maybe three blocks away from where he was. Using his new powers, he suddenly disappeared, and he appeared on the same street where the jocks were, without being noticed. “Make yourself invisible” Peter instructed, and Salvador responded by wishing for his body to turn invisible. “Run up to them and place yourself in front of them” Peter thought, and Salvador heard his instructions. While he was still invisible, he ran past the four high school kids, who were munching on their stolen candies.<br />
<br />
Trent, the football player, was holding the bag while the other three were occasionally taking candy out of it. “Dudes, are you guys feeling a bit heavy? I’m kinda full right now” David said. “I feel like I’ve gained about fifty pounds!” Brian said out loud. “Hey, all three of you guys look like you’ve grown a bit!” Jake said, who ate the least. “LOOK!” Trent shouted, as he pointed towards a figure that appeared in front of them.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Salvador appeared in front of the four jocks. “Give me the bag of candy! You stole it, and it belongs to me and my friends!” the boy shouted, as he pointed his finger straight at the bag that was in Trent’s hand. “Forget it!” Trent shouted, holding the bag even closer to his body. “Freeze him!” Peter instructed, and Salvador pointed his finger at Trent and shouted “FREEZE!”<br />
<br />
Immediately Trent found his body frozen! He could not move! “Trent, what’s wrong?” Brian said, wondering what had happened to the football player. “Make the bag of candy come to you!” Peter thought, and right away Salvador concentrated on the big brown bag. The bag loosened itself from Trent’s hands and it magically hovered over the street, flying towards Salvador.<br />
<br />
“Thank You, amigos! Hasta la vista, baby!” Salvador shouted, happy to have his candy back. “Don’t forget to unfreeze Trent!” Peter thought, as he instructed Salvador. The brown boy turned around and started to walk away, with the sixty-pound bag of candy hovering right next to him. “Trent??” Brian and Jake shouted, since they were more concerned about their friend than about their candy at that moment in time. Suddenly Trent was able to move again. “Guys, I don’t know about you, but I’m getting out of here! I’m going home! I don’t mess with guys who have that kind of power!” he said, trembling with fear. Trent turned around and walked straight home, leaving Jake, Brian and David.<br />
<br />
“The little creep stole our candy! It’s us three against the little twerp! Let’s get him!” Brian shouted. Then the three jocks began running after Salvador, who was already walking down the street where Dustin’s house was located. Salvador was about one block away from their house, when he heard the three jocks shouting things at him as they came running behind him.<br />
<br />
Salvador calmly turned around and stood in the middle of the street, with his legs spread apart and his hands on his hips. The bag of candy was still hovering besides him.<br />
<br />
“You little twerp! Give us that candy back! You thief!” Brian shouted at him. “It’s not your candy. It belongs to those kids, who are waiting on the lawn down the street. I’m returning the candy to them and you can’t stop me!” Salvador warned the jocks as they got closer to him.<br />
<br />
“I’m warning you! If you come closer, then I will turn you all into little ants!” Salvador said calmly, as the jocks slowed down. For a few seconds, they stood in front of them, not knowing what to do. Jake and David were afraid to get any closer to the boy, but Brian wanted the candy really bad, and he began to walk closer to Salvador. Jake and David walked behind Brian, and they figured the boy would be too scared to do anything to three jocks that were approaching him at the same time!<br />
<br />
But Salvador didn’t move. He understood how great his powers were, and he just stood there, showing a big smile on his face. “If you guys get any closer, then you are asking for it!” he warned once more. “I’m going to get my candy back!” Brian growled back at the teen. “Oh, I don’t think so!” Salvador teased.<br />
<br />
When Brian was within six feet from Salvador, the latter just smiled, as he wished for the big football jock to shrink. Within three seconds, Brian completely disappeared, leaving a pile of clothes and his shoes in the middle of the street. A little ant crawled out from under the pile! Jake and David gasped when they saw what happened to their buddy, but Salvador had frozen their bodies before they could turn around and run. <br />
<br />
“You’re next!” Salvador said calmly, pointing towards Jake. Jake disappeared, leaving another pile of clothes on the spot where the baseball player was standing. “And now it’s your turn!” Salvador said, as he looked at David, who was the last standing jock. Immediately David found himself shrinking down to a tenth of an inch, leaving a pile of clothing. His body had also changed into that of an ant. <br />
<br />
Finally, Salvador found himself standing on the street, looking out over three piles of clothing. Three little ants were crawling around in confusion, not understanding what had happened to them. <br />
<br />
“Now I will change you back, but you will not have your clothes on!” Salvador chuckled out loud. “I wish for the three jocks to change back to their original bodies, but without wearing their clothes!” Salvador wished out loud. Jake, Brian, and David appeared before him, completely naked! <br />
<br />
Salvador began to laugh out loud when the three jocks screamed at each other. “FORGET THE CANDY! I’m OUTTA HERE!!” Brian shouted, as he grabbed his clothes, and started to run down the street. Jake and David grabbed their belongings, and the three jocks ran towards their homes, while they were completely naked, and leaving Salvador laughing at them! “Ha ha ha ha! How funny! That was great!” Salvador thought to himself. “Good job, Salvador!” Peter thought, “Now come home with the loot!”<br />
<br />
All the kids who were patiently waiting on Dustin’s front lawn cheered when they saw Salvador walking down the street, with the bag hovering next to him. Dustin got several small paper bags out of the kitchen, and the kids divided up all the candy and poured the contents of the bag in the smaller bags. Salvador immediately walked up to Peter, who was standing next to Prince.<br />
<br />
“How did I do?” Salvador asked his teacher, who just grinned from ear to ear. “You were awesome! Great job, Salvador!” he said, as Prince clapped his hands three times. “You see, Peter? I knew you two could do this!” he responded.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, I need to go home. But I’ll call you when I get home from school. Maybe I’ll come over, okay?” Salvador said to his new teacher. “Sure, amigo! I shall see you tomorrow!” Peter replied. “Way to go, Salvador! You’re just like us now!” Ty said to him, as Ty put his arm on Salvador’s shoulder. “I am going to think of you as my little brother from now on!” he said with a smile, looking down at the chocolate brown colored kid who was standing next to him, while still wearing his white, transformation wizard’s robe. <br />
<br />
While he was still wearing his Superman costume, Peter walked home with the kids and came back after all the kids had gone back to their home. Prince walked along with Peter and the kids, as they walked down the different streets. “This was just a test. There will be greater challenges for you and Salvador. But you two will need to become like brothers. And I know that by then, nobody will be able to stop you!” Prince said to his apprentice.<br />
<br />
“Yes Master, I know…” Peter said, as he looked up at the full moon, which had illuminated the sky on what had become the most unforgettable Halloween night!</p>
