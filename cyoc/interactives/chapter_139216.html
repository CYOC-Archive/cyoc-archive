<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke woke up early that morning as he use to do on Mondays. Although his deep and long sleeping, his body felt numb like a rock. He took his time to stand up and when he made it, he felt so bad that he didn&#39;t go to the bathroom as he used to do and went directly to his wardrobe.<br />
<br />
On the hand, Tiff woke up late. She barely slept last night because she can&#39;t stop thinking about what happened to her brother and what advantage she could make of that.<br />
After turning off her third alarm, she quickly woke up and dressed. She expected to wake up earlier than her brother and go to see him but that wasn&#39;t possible now. She wondered if he saw himself and panicked or, even worse, if their parents saw him.<br />
She ran down the stairs but when she was near the kitchen she stopped running. There it was Luke taking his breakfast peacefully as if nothing had happened. He looked completely normal, no older, no black skin, just a regular skater preteen.<br />
She looked at him intrigued but she didn&#39;t make any question. Apparently, he didn&#39;t know what happened to him and she thought that it was better to her intentions that he don&#39;t know about it.<br />
She wickedly grinned and sat down to take her breakfast. She thought about the possibilities of this and glanced once again to her new guinea pig.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day wasn&#39;t different to any other one. He went to his school and she went to hers. In the evening, when they came back, Tiff ran directly to her bedroom, she quickly did her homework and began to prepare for that night. Meanwhile, Luke played video games until it was dinner time.<br />
Tiff offered to help again that night and Luke thought it was a little suspicious but he didn&#39;t care too much about it and finally he took his dinner. What he didn&#39;t know it&#39;s that Tiff had put things on his food again. A sleeping pill and some fruit puree that she hide inside his meal.<br />
After eating, he went to his bedroom and fell deeply asleep almost immediately. However, Tiff waited until their parents went to sleep to sneak into his bedroom again.<br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed was the snoring, loud just like last night. She didn&#39;t know why but she assumed it was related to Luke&#39;s changes.<br />
Then, when she was closer to him she realized that he hadn&#39;t changed at all. He wasn&#39;t black nor bigger nor anything. He was wearing just boxers, uncommon to him but that&#39;s all.<br />
She waited a while but nothing happened. Maybe she did something wrong or maybe last night was a dream, she thought. She&#39;s going to resign when she noticed that her brother was groaning while sleeping, but nothing else happened.<br />
She was so disappointed before she realized that something eas happening inside Luke&#39;s boxers. She quickly took them off leaving him completely naked.<br />
His dick, which had returned to normal after its huge size from last night, was getting rock hard. Tiff was a little embarrassed of seeing her brother&#39;s growing erection.<br />
When it reached its full size, the foreskin began to slowly pull back, exposing Luke&#39;s delicated pink mushroom head. Tiff blushed after seeing it but that wasn&#39;t all.<br />
It looked like his dick head was deflating, turning flat a balloon without air. It was followed by the rest of his dick until Luke has a odd flesh hanging where before was his penis.<br />
What the fuck?! Tiff thought before she noticed that Luke&#39;s balls where going through a similar process. In no time, Luke genitals had turned into disgusting pieces of flesh but that didn&#39;t end there.<br />
The hanging flesh was morphing into a familiar thing to Tiff, but it wasn&#39;t until it opened a slit between Luke&#39;s crotch when she realized that his brother had grown a clitoris. Except for that he looked always, a preteen skater boy, now with a pink and fleshy vagina.<br />
She doubt it for a second, but finally she decided to put two fingers inside her brother&#39;s slit. It was deep, she wondered, just a regular vagina. Luke moaned in plaesure but didn&#39;t wake up. He trembled occasionally.<br />
After taking some pictures and waiting for a while, Tiff realized that nothing else was going to happen, so she returned to her bedroom.<br />
In the morning, she met his brother at the kitchen and he didn&#39;t seem any different or even odd. She assumed that his dick regrow back before he awakes. She smiled and kept eating her breakfast.<br />
<br />
The next few days, Tiff repeated the process, offering to help with dinner to put the sleeping pill and the fruit puree on Luke&#39;s food. Then, at midnight, she sneaked into his bedroom at recorded what happened to him.<br />
The Tuesday, his body gained a lot of fat, doubling or tripling his size and weight.<br />
The Wednesday, Luke&#39;s body began to turn liquid so Tiff had to put him in the bathtub. Luke woke up next day really confused because of that.<br />
The Thursday, Luke&#39;s friend, Kyle, came to the house and stayed until dinner. Tiff wasn&#39;t going to see it but she thought it would be fun to put some fruit puree on Kyle&#39;s food too. In the night, she watched her brother turning into a golden retriever  and when she thought about Kyle&#39;s transformation, she remembered he used to be with his Rex, his dog, all the time. She smiled at the idea of both dogs sleeping together in the bed right now.<br />
<br />
Finally, it was Friday and Luke had invited some of his friends to his house. He was completely unknown of what his sister had done with him all the week.<br />
During dinner, Luke told his mother that he was going to sleep in Kyle&#39;s house that night. After hearing that, Tiff quickly tried to take off the puree from Luke&#39;s food but she was unsuccessful and he ate all his meal. A moment later, he and his friends left the house. Tiff was really worried of what could happen.</p>
