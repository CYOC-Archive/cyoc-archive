<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackie was feeling so divided about everything that just happened. Her friend group got into an argument about vampires again. It seemed to her that just as everything could go right, it immediately turned wrong again. Jackie had decided to drive home and talk with Ann, she offered Stephanie a ride home, but she declined saying that she&#39;ll come home with Travis a little after.<br />
<br />
Jackie took on her adult form and looked at herself in her rear-view mirror thinking to herself that while she may look like an adult half of the time, it seemed like she was the only adult amongst her friends. She now went inside to discuss her vexation about her friends to Ann, who listened intently to her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;.....so now, Connor is in the hospital with a hip replacement, his family is of course worried sick about him as they should be. But now, Gloria and the others are all divided about Duke&#39;s half-brother and his whole roll in this.&quot; Jackie explained as Ann sat down on their couch with a cup of tea in her hand and wearing a silk nightgown. It seemed she had been getting ready for bed when Jackie came home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what&#39;s your opinion on this whole debacle?&quot; Ann asked setting her tea down on their coffee table.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s honestly baffles me sometimes how they criticize me for shifting into my adult form, when it seems like they haven&#39;t grown up a whole lot. I don&#39;t want to take either side, but I can see both sides. Not all vampires are nice, just like not all people are nice. But people, and even vampires can change, they can become better people. It just doesn&#39;t really make sense to me that Duke&#39;s half-brother would suddenly send one of his men to attack Connor. Ugh, I just wish we had more to go off of. I couldn&#39;t believe Caleb either, he was talking about going to take out vampire toddlers, I know he&#39;s angry, but that&#39;s just....barbaric.&quot; Jackie sighed as Ann stood up and embraced her in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be alright, darling, you&#39;ll see, it&#39;ll work out in time.&quot; Ann said reassuringly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think so?&quot; Jackie asked as she kissed Ann on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we&#39;ve worked out things before too.&quot; Ann said as Jackie smiled at this and the two of them kissed each other gently on the lips.<br />
<br />
Both women were then suddenly surprised by a knock at their door. The two of them went to go answer it, and were surprised to see Travis&#39;s mother, Life, on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening ladies, I trust I&#39;m not interrupting anything.&quot; Life joked looking at Ann who blushed in embarrasment and grabbed her robe quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, relax ladies, with all the drama that&#39;s going on, I thought I&#39;d surprise you two with something incredible. You&#39;re both going to want to sit down for this.&quot; Life said as Ann and Jackie invited Life inside their house.<br />
<br />
Stephanie was now sitting in the passenger seat of Travis&#39;s car. It would be a while before Stephanie got another car after her accident. Travis could tell her mind was on their friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what I said back at the hospital was true. Connor isn&#39;t going to die for quite a long time. He&#39;ll have his surgery and he&#39;ll be better, just not as he once was.&quot; Travis said trying to reassure his girlfriend who seemed very melancholy about everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t want my friends to split up over this too. I love all my friends, Miles, Miranda, Chenoa, Amara, and Connor, and Spark too. I don&#39;t want my friends to separate and leave me alone again. If it means staying on Connor&#39;s side and being friends with them, I&#39;ll believe Connor and Spark.&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steph, I know the world can be pretty cruel. But my mom always says there&#39;s joy to look forward to in the most unlikely of places. I know you have that joy too whenever you come home to your moms. Maybe they can give you a little hope now.&quot; Travis suggested.<br />
<br />
Travis and Stephanie soon arrived at Stephanie&#39;s house and entered. They were both surprised to see Travis&#39;s mother standing there looking like she had just finished speaking with Stephanie&#39;s mothers as Ann looked like she was giggling while Jackie looked like she was holding back tears, but she looked happy about the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? What are you doing here?&quot; Travis asked as he closed the door behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as I was just telling Stephanie&#39;s wonderful mothers, when you told us how Ann and Jackie rescued you two from that car accident, your father and I decided to repay Stephanie&#39;s mothers for their great kindness. That is why I&#39;ve given your mothers the greatest gift of all: life.&quot; Life said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not following here.&quot; Stephanie said confused.<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie now stood up and walked over to Stephanie both trying to keep from giggling as they approached their daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie, Travis&#39;s mother has made it so that we can have a baby together, without any male help.&quot; Jackie explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Stephanie asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life came in and offered us the chance to have a baby together, after the two of us have gotten married of course, then it&#39;s just a matter of....nature taking its course and the baby is born.&quot; Ann said patting her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, mom, you&#39;re going to have the baby?&quot; Stephanie asked Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ann replied with a blush. &quot;I offered Jackie to be the mother, but she insisted I be the one to carry our child. She said I deserve it more than her.&quot; Ann said as she held Jackie&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you should Angel, I&#39;d do anything to make my future wife and child&#39;s mother happy.&quot; Jackie said as she gave Ann a few kisses on the cheek as Ann giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have one last surprise just for the two of you. If you have a full body mirror, look into it and you can have a glimpse into your future.&quot; Life said as Ann and Jackie got excited and went into their bedroom where they looked into their full body mirror where they saw a fully pregnant Ann with Jackie standing next to her. They noticed the reflections were doing the same movements as them. Ann and Jackie held their hands over Ann&#39;s stomach and were surprised they could feel Ann&#39;s pregnant belly, even though she wasn&#39;t the least pregnant yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Angel....&quot; Jackie said as she looked into Ann&#39;s eyes. &quot;Oh my darling, it&#39;s going to be so wonderful...&quot; Ann replied back as they gave each other a tender kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
The two of them made their way back into the living room to speak more with Life who was still in the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I understand Jackie, that your grades have been phenomenal as of late and you&#39;ll be graduating sooner than most of your classmates with flying colors.&quot; Life said as they were surprised to hear she knows this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m Life, it&#39;s my job to keep up with those I help create.&quot; Life said with a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was supposed to be a little surprise to you and Stephanie, but I found out not too long ago since I&#39;ve been keeping my grades up higher than most, I&#39;m actually graduating sooner than my peers. So it looks like our wedding will be in the future sooner than later.&quot; Jackie confessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get two legally married moms and a baby sibling? That&#39;s amazing!&quot; Stephanie said as she gave her mothers a hug and they hugged Stephanie back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Travis, do you think I could be alone for a while with my moms? I promise I&#39;ll call you later.&quot; Stephanie said as she gave her boyfriend a goodbye kiss.<br />
<br />
Life then motioned for her son and himself to give his girlfriend and mothers a little privacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Stephanie, do you want to talk about the hospital?&quot; Ann asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No....I&#39;d rather just sit here with my family and not think about the rest of the world right now.&quot; Stephanie said as the three of them sat down on the couch. Ann and Jackie gave each other a kiss, and Stephanie gave each of her mothers a kiss on the cheeks as well. They spent the rest of the night together as a happy family.</p>
