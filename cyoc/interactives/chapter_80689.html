<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Back for more?  I'm still cleaning up after your other pups, Sir.&quot;  Barry inspected Jack, &quot;he's a bit small compared to Patrick and the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked over Jack, walking around the hulking beast standing at attention.  Despite Jack's massive size, Dan could feel how the slightest <br />
movements he made affected his new pup.  He was the center of Jack's attention, Jack's world.  Dan stopped pacing at Jack's side, gently <br />
running his hand over Jack's forearm, watching his pup shudder, his hairs standing on end briefly, his cock hardening even more.  <br />
<br />
&quot;M-Master...&quot;  Jack whimpered out, this slight touch was pushing him deeper, his knees wobbling slightly.  This feeling, this NEED to submit to <br />
his Master was so intense.  Jack didn&quot;t have the capacity to think through these feelings...they just kept building, growing inside him, <br />
overwhelming him.<br />
<br />
Dan shushed Jack, continuing his inspection.  &quot;You are a bit smaller than your brothers, pup.&quot;  Dan's words hit Jack hard in the chest, his heart <br />
aching suddenly...the usual feelings of doubt and worthlessness growing inside him.  Why was such a perfect human wasting time with him?  <br />
He needed to be so much more for his Master--&quot;PUP.&quot;  Dan barked at Jack, snapping him back to attention, keeping his attention on the <br />
moment.  &quot;You will get bigger, you will be more.  Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack nodded quickly, eagerly, &quot;Y-Yes, Master!&quot;  He stumbled for words, struggling to piece together what he was about to say...Jack never felt <br />
this way.  He was usually so quick on his feet, so articulate, but his Master had such an overwhelming presence, it couldn&quot;t be helped.  &quot;I--I&quot;  <br />
Jack paused, whimpering, frustrated, &quot;I will spend everyday, Master, every moment pushing myself to be more for you.&quot;  Jack couldn&quot;t contain <br />
this feeling anymore...he fell to his hands and knees, ass high in the air, &quot;P-Please Master, tell me how I can be a better pup...I will do anything, <br />
everything I can.  You are my world,&quot; Jack whimpered as he worked himself deeper, this outpour of emotion only building momentum the <br />
longer he spent at his Master's feet, &quot;You are everything, Master...and I will make you proud! I-I love you, Master, T-Thank you for granting me <br />
this chance to be your pup.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked upon the sight of his pup on his hands and knees and he felt for the beast before him, he sympathised with him. His pup needed to <br />
be perfect for him and anything short than that will be unsatisfactory	. His pup needed to know that as long as he gave his very best, there <br />
would always be a part in his heart for Jack.<br />
<br />
Jack's eyes were getting rather teary, but he could see his Master. Never in his life had he ever known anyone more loving, more beautiful, <br />
anyone who treated him so nicely. As he sunk into his subspace further his entire world around him seemed to blur, the only thing which was <br />
in sharp focus was his Master and his needs to fulfill every one of his wishes and desires... it was his duty, it was his purpose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pup, raise yourself to kneeling again&quot; Dan ordered. For a moment there as his pup rose he got lost, slightly distracted by the patterns of <br />
golden-red hair which covered his pup's ball belly and chest - and continued to travel down surrounding the massive anaconda which came <br />
from your pup's groin and the pendulous heavy ballsack - each of those nuts must have been at least 80lbs each...and growing larger by <br />
minute.  Dan's original commands to make all redheads overproduce cum was staggering to watch in person.  Jack's balls were literally <br />
growing larger with cum, churning, swelling, inching bigger.  The sexual ache growing alongside them...<br />
<br />
Your pup rises to attention and you get a glimpse of his eyes - they are the deepest shade of blue in this light, but his best feature were his <br />
platinum blonde eyebrows, the thick shafts which framed his eyes perfectly.<br />
<br />
Your pup was truly beautiful, but he will never know. Other people might admire him, but in his own mind he will always be too small, and <br />
there was no upper limit to his growth, to how much he felt he needed to improve himself to make his Master proud. A pup can never be <br />
conceited.<br />
<br />
It's important to know that his pups were loved, even his three pups at home would need regular reassurance and affection otherwise they <br />
would start to sink into themselves...they were probably at home now, whimpering, aching with need for their Master.  Dan's last command had <br />
them sent off to his dorm where he knew they would dutifully wait till he returned...whenever that was.<br />
<br />
Even while standing up Dan came up to head hight while his pup kneeled. He grabbed his pups collar, the lock massive, hot and heavy in his <br />
hands and he pulled his pup forward toward himself, his pup jerked forward and but gave himself over to it - he liked to be handled a little <br />
roughtly - as evidenced by the layer of pre which was starting to cover his prince albert. He brought his own face against his pup's, feeling his <br />
silky crimson beard against his face, your pup was whimpering little utterences, letting out little squeeks, until the two of their lips combined. <br />
For your pup the sensation was extraordinary, such a sensual and incredible closeness, he felt himself grow harder, his now rigid cock <br />
straddling under Dan's legs, theatening to lift him up if his Master turned him on any more, he balls ached even more.<br />
<br />
His Master's saliva tasted sweet, one of the most rewarding things that he had ever tasted - not not nearly as much as his Master's cum - not <br />
even close. <br />
<br />
A small whimper interrupted Dan's makeout session...Barry was watching intently from his table, eyes teary with a mix of envy and longing.  &quot;I-<br />
I'm sorry...please continue...&quot;  Barry's face went red as he abruptly turned away, suddenly very interested in his tattoo equipment.<br />
<br />
Jack let out a sympathetic whimper...Barry was even smaller than Jack.  His chances of impressing a Master and earning his collar, brand, and <br />
love were even less.  Jack nosed his Master, so thankful for his collar, and soon the permanent mark that was his brand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought I would be here, Master.&quot;  Jack whimpered, sniffling, &quot;I-I never thought I was handsome enough, big enough, smart <br />
enough...I&quot;ve been overlooked by every Dom.  But you saw me, Master.&quot;  Jack struggled to look up to Dan's eyes, a split second of eye contact <br />
was all Jack could handle.  &quot;T-Thank you, Master...Thank you for claiming me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Dan pulled his pup close, hugging him lightly...&quot;There there, pup--&quot; it was all the invitation Jack needed to hug back, the full strength of a 10-<br />
foot, half-ton redhead squeezing back with every ounce of love he had, &quot;--oooffff!&quot;  Dan gasped for air, tapping Jack on the back to release.<br />
<br />
's-Sorry, Master!&quot;  Jack whimpered, head down, smiling.  His Master chuckled...he was so eager for more of these moments.  Just these tiny <br />
interactions with his Master were what he lived for.  <br />
<br />
&quot;At attention, pup.&quot;  Dan commanded, brushing globs of Jack's pre from his tanktop and shorts.  &quot;I have simple rules for you to follow if you&quot;re <br />
to be my pup.  Once I brand you, there is no going back.  You are my property...forever.&quot;  Dan looked into Jack's eyes to solidify the statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am your Master, pup, the only one you are able to love or serve.  You will only refer to me as your Master, nothing else.  Your service to me is <br />
your number one priority in life...it is your reason for living.  You will have a life outside your service to me, but its only out of necessity, <br />
pup...every moment away from me will tear at your heart and make you ever eager to return to my feet.  Just thinking of doing anything outside <br />
your service to me fills you with intense guilt, shame, depression.&quot;  Dan watched his words sink into his pup, Jack's eyes glazed over slightly, as <br />
if his mind were rewriting itself...the very reactions and emotions burning into his brain as Dan dictated them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pup!&quot; you barked out to Jack, and his attention comes back to you. You notice that his face has gone bright red - he's blushing. Your pup <br />
takes a moment to find the right words. You look at the movements of his mouth, it took him a few attempts before he was able to vocalise <br />
again.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-M-Master, all I ever want to be... is... is be by your side. I..I I will always be there for you, no m-m-m-atter what you do. I w-will always love <br />
you, M-Master&quot; your pup is struggling to find these words in what is the most intense feelings of submission he's ever had.<br />
<br />
You attempt to encourage your pup to finish his thought, but holding on to his hand - you notice how hot his paw is, and how big they really <br />
are. Your pup seems to blush even redder and the trickle of pre coming from your pup's monster cock (much to big for any practical purpose - <br />
just the way his Master likes it) started from a trickle to a stream.<br />
<br />
His pup reached forward and pulled his Master closer towards him, kissing the back of his Master's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;and...and... I will always be loyal to you... your w-word is my law. Y-your hope-s a-a-a-are my hopes and your am-b-bitionsions are my <br />
ambitions. I-I-I will never hurt you, I will never leave you.  You are the only one I can s-s-erve, the only one who matters. My o-only wish is to <br />
be able to make you h-happy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dan was touched by this outpour of his pup. It was then that Dan noticed something unique was happening, as your pup was pouring his heart <br />
out to his Master, he noticed that his pup's dimensions were edging out even larger - it wasn&quot;t just his balls - it was all of him and he wasn&quot;t <br />
evening noticing, he would never notice - in his own mind he would always be much smaller than his Master.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-P-Please Master. Brand me, I b-belong to you. I want the world to know. But Master... w-whether you brand me or not. I w-w-will always be <br />
your property. I will never w-wear another's collar or call another &quot;M-Master&quot;. I b-beg you, b-brand me Master. I'm not worthy now, I'm not <br />
even close - a-a-and&quot; his voice cracked upon saying it, his face was becoming puffy with tears. &quot; if you choose not to have me, I would fully <br />
understand.&quot;</p>
