<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;WHAT THE FUCK?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max was jolted from the most wonderful sleep he&#39;d ever had by the shocked cry of the cop standing in the doorway. He looked down and went white when he realized that Will was still in his arms, the boy startled from his own slumber by the sudden disturbance. The little cowboy cursed under his breath when he saw that it was Todd who was staring at them in stunned horror - he should&#39;ve figured that his partner would circle back to check on him at some point.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-this isn&#39;t w-what it looks like - &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hands in the air. NOW.&quot; Max&#39;s stammered plea was cut off by the shouted command of the furious policeman, who drew out his weapon and leveled it at the supposed kidfucker to punctuate his point. &quot;I don&#39;t know how the fuck you got in here but I&#39;ll see to it personally that Will gets a few moments alone with you in an interrogation room for what you did to his nephew. Draco, are you...Draco?&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;nephew&quot; had used Todd&#39;s focus on Max to slip away from the scene, the naked ten-year-old grabbing the Chronivac and furiously touch-tapping the screen as the cop finally turned his way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, I need you to put that down and come with meeeeeeeEEEEEE...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd shrank so fast that the last word sounded like it came from a deflated balloon, the pitch growing higher and higher as the cop was blown backwards through adulthood and adolescence. He disappeared into his uniform shirt, which seemed to hang in mid-air for a moment before settling like a smock on a much smaller and cuter version of Todd. The shirt, in fact, was all that kept his newly-boyish body from being fully on display - his slacks and underwear had slithered all the way down his smooth skinny legs and puddled around the boots that his tiny feet now swam in. Max gaped and Will grinned as a flabbergasted Todd slowly lowered his big blue eyes, eyes that grew wider and wider as studied himself in silent shock.<br />
<br />
His companions couldn&#39;t help but stare too, but for reasons of their own - while Will was a handsome kid, Todd was downright adorable. At eight, his utter cuteness emanated not only from his soft blonde hair and round rosy cheeks but also from his slight plumpness at not having yet shed all that stubborn baby fat. Max realized his cock was coming back to life despite the strangeness of the situation, and when he looked over at Will he saw that the kid was openly tugging on his stiffie with his free hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;As sweet as you look in your oversized uniform, Todd, I think I know a way to make you even sweeter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will tapped at the Chronivac again, grin widening as Todd&#39;s shirt and pants vanished. The eight-year-old squealed in shame as he clamped his hands over his widdle peepee, as the only remaining parts of his outfit - his hat, his boots and his belt - shrank to fit his new proportions. The gun that had fallen out of his hand turned plastic to match the toy belt that now clung slinkily to his chubby waist, a pair of small silver handcuffs dangling from one hip while the empty holster rubbed up against the other. In a matter of seconds Todd&#39;s duds had become a mockery of his former uniform, the scantily-dressed shrunken cop looking as though he had escaped from the same bizarre strip club where Will had gotten his sexy cowboy gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...what did...I...guhhhh...&quot; Todd&#39;s head spun and his rounded knees wobbled as the reality of his situation came crashing down at him all at once, the overwhelmed eight-year-old feeling ready to faint before Will stepped to him and gently embraced the boy. His newly-regressed companion turned tomato as Will&#39;s rock-hard little cock brushed against Todd&#39;s nub, the younger boy gasping as it quickly stiffened to its full two-and-a-half-inch majesty. As much as he needed answers about what happened to him, those answers became less and less important as Will slowly drew his palms down Todd&#39;s slender back and grasped his plump cheeks with both hands. The younger boy gasped at the sudden rush of delight he felt from being handled that way the bigger boy, which Will took as an opportunity to plant his lips on Todd&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Todd was awkward and clumsy at first but soon his passion guided him onto Will&#39;s wavelength - soon he and his similarly-regressed colleague were full-on making out, Todd following Will&#39;s lead and taking hold of his firm little ass as the ground their tiny stiff cocks together. Max, meanwhile, was agape as another fantasy came true before his eyes, absently stroking himself as the beautiful boys became lost in their own little world of pure pleasure. It was stimulating enough on its own just to watch, but maybe they wouldn&#39;t mind if he joined the fun...</p>
