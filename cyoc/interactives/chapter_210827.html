<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff loved waking up on snowy mornings, because even before he got out of bed, he knew something was different.  Something about the world outside his window was just quieter, and when he looked outside he loved knowing he was right.<br />
<br />
What happened this morning was similar.  When Jeff woke up, there was nothing specific telling him something was off, but he knew before he looked out his window that it wasn&#39;t just a normal day.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, there was a large crowd of women, all patiently standing around and waiting.  There must have been hundreds of them, filling up his lawn to capacity, and even spilling off the yard.  They were blocking the street entirely.<br />
<br />
Jeff was groggy and a bit confused as to why they were there, but he realized it right when one of the women pointed at him.  &quot;There he is!&quot; she shouted, and all the women turned towards him.  He was on the second floor, thank goodness, but it was still scary to see them all crowding up towards his house.  Was there going to be a stampede?  Were they going to climb up into his room and break his window?  <br />
<br />
Jeff figured it was time to take control of the situation before someone got hurt, especially if that someone was going to be himself.  He knew they were all there because they would get better job opportunities if they let Jeff eat their asses.  He just hadn&#39;t realized how many women would be so interested.  At first he wasn&#39;t sure what to do, but then he saw Allison DiCarlo.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe it.  Allison was a senior and the hottest girl in school.  Jeff would say he had a crush on her, but she was so far out of his league that it didn&#39;t count as a crush.  He was sure she had no idea who he was, but here she was, apparently showing up at his house early in the morning just so Jeff could give her a rimjob.  He didn&#39;t quite understand what she would get out of being here, but maybe having Jeff eat her ass would help her get into a better college the same way it would help older women get better jobs.  Whatever it was, Jeff wasn&#39;t about to complain.<br />
<br />
As Jeff opened the window, he realized he didn&#39;t want to piss off all the other women who showed up, so he started there.  &quot;Hey everyone,&quot; he said.  &quot;There&#39;s going to be plenty of time for me to meet all of you, but first, Allison, could you come up here for a minute?&quot;  He pointed at Allison so she would know he meant her, and she actually blushed.  Jeff couldn&#39;t believe it.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, a few moments later the doorbell rang.  Jeff heard his mother open the door and cheerfully tell Allison that Jeff was upstairs.  A few moments after that, Allison DiCarlo was in his bedroom.  And she wanted him.<br />
<br />
She was so hot.  &quot;Let&#39;s make out for a little bit first,&quot; Jeff said, and Allison smiled and obliged.  Jeff knew she would go along with his requests in hopes that he would eat her ass.  And sure enough, after a few minutes of the most glorious make-out session of his life, he was turned on enough that he knew what he wanted next.  But he wanted her to ask for it, so he pulled away and took a breath.  &quot;Is there anything else you want to do?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Allison looked almost bashful.  &quot;Could you... is there any chance you&#39;d be willing to lick my asshole for a bit?&quot; she asked timidly.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but grin.  &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
It was the best experience of his life.  Allison let him pull down her jeans, and he kissed and licked the back of her panties and then her two cheeks for a few minutes.  When he finally couldn&#39;t resist anymore, he dove right in and stuck his tongue into her asshole.  He had never actually done this before, and he wasn&#39;t sure if the reality would live up to his kinks.  As it turned out, it was everything he wanted: a mild, tangy taste, and all the fun of licking ass that he had hoped for.  For her part, Allison moaned as soon as his tongue touched her asshole, and she was into it the whole time.  She rubbed her fingers on her clit the whole time until she came.<br />
<br />
Eventually Jeff pulled back.  That was amazing, but he realized he had hundreds of women he could be doing this with as well.  &quot;That was great, Allison,&quot; he said, &quot;but you should get going.  Maybe we could do this again sometime?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled and said sure, and then she got dressed again and headed out.  Jeff couldn&#39;t believe it.  Maybe he could actually date Allison DiCarlo.  But not today: he had more wild oats to lick.  He went back to the window.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s how Jeff spent the rest of his day.  He didn&#39;t recognize many other women besides Allison, so he just pointed at the most attractive woman he could see and told her to come on up.  He tried all sorts of different things: 69, alternating between two girls at once, even going human centipede and eating someone&#39;s ass while someone else ate his.  All of it was great.  Everyone tasted a little different too, adding some fun to it.  He came mightily more times than he could remember, but he stayed turned on the entire time.  And best of all, every woman absolutely loved it.<br />
<br />
Around dinnertime, Jeff finally sent the rest of the women home for the day.  It was time for some actual food.  As he reflected on his day, he thought about what to do next.</p>
