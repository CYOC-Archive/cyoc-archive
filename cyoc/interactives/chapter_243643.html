<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">|| Another short side story, this one I tried to write it in 1st person. Hope y&#39;all enjoy!||<br />
<br />
I hope this is the right address. Nice place for people who used to genitals. I’ve drove past here and always wondered who owned this house. Kyle mentioned there was some obscure law about reversed people getting government support for schooling and work, I wonder if they also get financial aide of some kind. <br />
<br />
*Ding Dong* Ok. Here it goes. Hopefully they don’t try to turn me here and now. I’m doing this for my boyfriend. And if he’s not ready to transform yet then neither am I. <br />
<br />
“Hello, is that the lovely and pretty cock from the other day?” I could recognize Sue’s playful tone anywhere. I wonder if she’s just as playful in bed…. No control yourself Mary. You’re doing this for Kyle. <br />
<br />
“Y-yes, it’s me. T-the c-cock.” <br />
<br />
“Oh you can do better than that, why be ashamed of what you are? I wanna hear you say it.”<br />
<br />
“Y-YES IT’S ME THE COCK! M-May I come in?” How embarrassing. Shouting something so obscene out in public. They’re lucky there’s no one around otherwise I’d-<br />
<br />
 “Hello shlong, how are you?” Ryan’s sultry voice could be heard as he opened the door for me. “I’m ok, but don’t call me that.” I hurried inside, flustered as all hell. “You guys said you had info for me, so I’m here to get it.”<br />
<br />
“Well of course, but you know you shouldn’t be ashamed of what you are. Under this roof you’re safe to be yourself. Your name isn’t Mary here. You’re a penis and will be called as such” I struggled to contain my smile when he said that. Regardless of how I portray it outwards, talking about turning into a penis does get me excited in a way I’ve never been before.<br />
<br />
“Firstly fuck-rod, where’s the pussy? She may want to see this too.” Ryan said. “He’s at home, I’m going there after. Figured since you guys lived close to me, that I would stop here by myself then go to him after.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s cute. The dick wanted to figure out if what she’s feeling is really real. Is she really going to turn into a penis.” Damn, figured me out fast. “Ok, I admit I’m skeptical. But who wouldn’t be. People don’t normally turn into genitals out of nowhere.”<br />
<br />
“Who said it was out of nowhere?” Sue said as she came into the room. “In every account of reversal that has ever been recorded. Most of the time, it was wanted. Very rarely was there a case of someone unwilling to reverse.”<br />
<br />
“Like those two gym rats, who became pussies.” added Ryan. “Or the guy who changed at the pool. They say that lifeguard reversed only a week later.”<br />
<br />
“But,” Sue interrupted, “everyone who has been reversed has come to love their new lives as genitals. And we’re happy being people. It’s a win-win every time.”<br />
<br />
I wasn’t really buying it. “So you’re telling me, that if I do become a cock, I’ll be happy?” Ryan smiled wide. “Want to ask Wendy?” I stopped, confused as all hell. “Who is Wendy?”<br />
<br />
Ryan began to stand up. Losing his already lose fitting sweats to reveal the biggest penis I’d ever seen. ”This is Wendy. Or rather was. Unlike Sue’s pussy though, Wendy hasn’t completely lost herself to cockdom yet… go on, ask her your question.”<br />
<br />
“How dare you! I have boyfriend! This constitutes as sexual assault I’ll have you know!” I began to protest, until Sue got behind Ryan, and lifted her dress, revealing her pussy. Immediately I was in a trance. All I could do was stare. I had my own, and I’d never been lesbian… so why is it… that right now… all I want to do is… fuck her pussy…<br />
<br />
“If that doesn’t confirm you’re going to go full cock eventually, I don’t know what will.” Sue laughed. <br />
<br />
As I inched closer to the couple, specifically to get a better view of Sue’s pussy, they both covered up, smirking. They know what they did to me. They just showed me what will happen to me. Soon all I will want is to fuck pussy. Cum inside of them and get them pregnant with my seed. To feel my balls tighten as I unleash load upon load into my lover’s womb. I thought back to Kyle and began to feel my excitement growing. I was growing noticeably horny, and I had to cool down before I overheated and began to finger myself in front of these two.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna need some more evidence, surely you two have video proof?”, I managed to get out, asking not only out of curiosity but for my own… personal gain.<br />
<br />
“Well there is the research videos our friends provided us with…” Sue said. “Yeah the ones that helped them transform… man that was back in Professor Rodrick’s class. I wonder what happened to her?” Ryan said, causing the couple to briefly ponder. “Regardless though, I’m sure I know what you WANT to see. But we won’t show it to you unless you ask, and ask the right way.” No way, I’m not doing any sexual favors for them, I draw the line there.<br />
<br />
Before I could even begin to stand up to leave, Ryan’s dick was out again. This time I couldn’t take my eyes off it. I began to pant, my vision blurred, and there was one burning desire in my mind. “H-how d-did you transform, W-Wendy?” I stammered. “Ah ah ah. It’s not Wendy actually, it’s just cock.” Ryan said, smug ass grin on his face. I gulped. “How did you transform… cock…”. The cock flexed, now standing at full mast. I had to ask my other question now, who knows when I’ll get another opportunity. “A-a-and if I was to become… like you… a cock… would I… be happy?” The cock bobbed up and down. Almost in a nodding motion. <br />
<br />
After that, I felt the floodgates open. My pussy was a dripping mess. I had to get out of here now asap. <br />
<br />
“Alright babe I think we’ve had our fun. Give her the book.” Laughed Sue. “B-book?” I pondered. “Yes there’s a book our old friends <br />
Heather and Adam have been writing, we were actually given an early draft. We were gonna keep it for memorabilia, but we remembered they made the book to help reversing people. So we want to give it to you and Kyle. We just hope your owners one day do the same, and help another reversing person.”<br />
<br />
I was a little taken back, still aroused beyond comprehension. “Thank you, this is a big help. I appreciate you both for doing this for us.”. “Oh and one other thing before you go,” Ryan said, handing me a CD with the name “Wendy”, written on it with a blue sharpie, the picture of a cock cutely drawn beside the name, “Incase you need a little bit of… encouragement.”<br />
<br />
I left the house quickly with the book and CD. Hiding them in book bag for school. As I got out to my car and drove to Kyle’s, only one thing was on my mind: Getting these panties off as quick as possible.</p>
