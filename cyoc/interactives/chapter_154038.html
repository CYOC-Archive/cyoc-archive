<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yuriko sat in stunned silence as she gazed at Ann and Jackie. She had zero idea what to ask two people she had known her whole life. The idea that either one could even fathom merging the timelines and erasing so many people from existence just didn’t seem reasonable. The teen had no idea how to even begin talking with the two of them, thankfully Zack was able to break the ice.<br />
<br />
“So were you two at a costume party,” Zack asked Jackie and Ann as he pressed a gauze pad to his head. Jackie blushed slightly as she gazed the large man. “Sort of,” Ann said sheepishly. “Unfortunately my um, girlfriend hurt her foot when some kids tried egging her home.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry to hear that,” Zack stated. Jackie gave a polite smile as she now extended her hand. “Thanks,” she said. “I’m Jackie. This is Ann.”<br />
<br />
“Zack,” he said, a small smile on his face. “This is my...”<br />
<br />
“I’m his niece Allison,” Yuriko said quickly. “My um...uncle got hurt when he was putting up some decorations. He um...got hit in the head.” Jackie and Ann nodded as Zack narrowed his eyes at Yuriko. “So do you two live around here,” Yuriko asked.<br />
<br />
“Ann does,” Jackie stated. “I’m just in town for the evening.” Yuriko nodded as she saw a sad smile spread across Jackie’s face. “Oh okay,” Yuriko said quietly. “So, do you ever wish you lived here?” Jackie gave the teen an odd look before smiling. “Yeah a little,” she said. “But it’s only temporary, Ann and I plan on living together soon. I just have some...things I need to take care of first. Til then I’m happy with things the way they are. Yuriko could only nod as she gazed at the couple. Jackie was being sincere in her statement, despite the difficult state of her relationship with Ann she was willing to wait. Jackie would never jeopardize Ann’s safety.<br />
<br />
“Ann O’Toole.”<br />
<br />
Jackie and Ann gazed towards the front desk as the nurse began scanning the waiting room. “Guess it’s our turn,” Ann stated. “Nice to meet you. Hope your Halloween gets a bit better.” Yuriko thanked them, wishing the couple well as they made they way towards one of the rooms. “So what do you think,” Zack asked. Yuriko could only shrug as she watched Ann and Jackie disappear. “I don’t think they’re the ones I should be worried about,” she said. “Can’t really go into the details but Ann and Jackie would never try to harm anyone.”<br />
<br />
Zack nodded as Yuriko checked his wound. “Well the good news is your wound healed,” she said happily. “No thanks to you,” Zack frowned. The large man now sighed before giving Yuriko an impish smile. “Hey listen,” he said. “I may not know exactly what’s going on but I can tell you this those two are definitely not involved.”<br />
<br />
“How can you tell,” Yuriko asked. Zack chuckled before giving Yuriko a toothy grin. “Experience,” he said. “Just trust me. Now, how would you like to dish out some karma to those kids that hurt Ann?”<br />
<br />
“Sure but how can we do that,” Yuriko asked. Zack smirked, beckoning to his nose. “Caught a whiff of their scent. Pretty sure I can track them, that is if you can take us there?” Yuriko grinned as she and Zack now quietly made their way out of the hospital.<br />
<br />
***************************************<br />
<br />
Dylan and Evan laughed as they now dug through their bag of treats. The two 12 year olds had made an incredible haul trick or treating, and had some fun when people gave them treats they didn’t necessarily approve of. The two boys couldn’t help but laugh as they looked at the nearly empty egg crates by their sides. “Did you see that one lady that wiped out trying to chase us,” Dylan laughed.<br />
<br />
“Serves her right,” Evan chuckled. “I mean, who gives out crappy jellybeans for Halloween. Bet she’ll learn to get better candy from now on.” As the boys continued to laugh they didn’t notice a teenage girl and a large man slowly approach.<br />
<br />
“Hey you two,” Yuriko yelled. Dylan and Evan jumped before glaring at the teenage girl. “What,” Dylan hissed. Yuriko frowned as she approached the two boys. “You know it’s really not cool to hurt someone especially on Halloween.”<br />
<br />
“Got no idea what your talking about,” Evan said flippantly. “And even if I did all I would say is that next time a certain someone needs to hand out better candy.” Yuriko frowned as she looked at the arrogant preteens before a small smile spread across her face. “Had a feeling it was something stupid like that,” she grinned. “That’s why I brought my friend. He’s about to show you that you need to be careful who you trick.” The two 12 year olds gave Yuriko a curious look before turning towards the large man by her side. The guy in front of them was enormous but Dylan and Evan had a feeling they could outrun him if need be. That changed quickly though as Zack began to change.<br />
<br />
Zack smiled maliciously as he began to grow. As a man Zack stood 6’5” with a solid amount of muscle on his body. As he began to transform he grew. Zacks height shot up to 9 feet tall, his body swelling with muscle as dark fur began to sprout all over his body. The mans face began to push out, a large muzzle with razor sharp fangs snarled at the two boys. Dylan and Evan went pale as a 9 foot tall were wolf with bulging muscle growled at them. As the two boys now tried to turn and run Zack grasped them by the scruff of their shirts. Dangling the boys in front of him in two massive clawed hands.<br />
<br />
“You think inflicting pain on others is funny,” he growled. “You hurt others for fun. Inflict pain on people for no reason. You are turds, slime, the type of people this world could easily do without.” Dylan and Evan whimpered in fright, the color draining from their faces as their bladders emptied. “I should tear off your arms,” Zack growled, a fiendish smile spreading across his wolffish face. “Tear off your legs. Leave you as turds forced to roll through the streets but I am feeling merciful. Go home, remember my warning because if you don’t I will return. And next time I will not be so merciful.” Zack released the two boys who fell into a quivering pile before leaping to their feet and sprinting for home, a trail of urine staining the ground.<br />
<br />
Zack smirked as he looked down at Yuriko, the teen stifling a giggle. “Do you think they got the message,” he asked. Yuriko nodded, reaching up to try and scratch Zack behind the ear. “Pretty sure they did,” Yuriko said happily. “Hopefully that’s the last time they try egging anyone’s house. Too bad they don’t know your all bark and no bite.”<br />
<br />
Zack laughed heartily, the sound raspy and animalistic. “That’s only with good people,” he growled. “If you hurt people, bully people, I’m not so nice.”<br />
<br />
“Well you’ve always been nice to me,” Yuriko said happily. “And you are to this day the best show and tell any kindergarten kid ever had.”<br />
<br />
“Not many kindergarteners bring full grown and tamed wolves to show and tell,” Zack replied. “Now let’s head back and find Mia. Hopefully she’s had as much fun as we did.”</p>
