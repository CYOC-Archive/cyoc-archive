<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Mila could so much as raise her voice the two were already piling into the bathroom, pulled along by Siya’s excitement. Mila stammered a protest, but it was lost to Siya’s ramblings about her plans for the evening, which were so chaotic she spent a significant time probing her own ideas, all while gesturing and setting up the shower. Mila’s uncomfort hit boiling point, standing there as she tried to stammer out a request for a pause, before it all melted away.<br />
<br />
Siya’s jumper came off, discarded by the door, her nipples bleeding through a lacy bra. She was chubby, her softness giving her curvy hips all too often hidden underneath baggy clothes, her breasts always deceptively large. Mila watched on, the sister’s body raising a thousand questions of her own, chief among them ‘am I that hot?’<br />
<br />
Siya looked back, her once confident posture menting under her sister’s gaze.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I get excited, do you want to…”<br />
<br />
“It’s f-fine.” Mila smiled, locking the door and pulling off her hoodie. “We are sisters, so I guess it&#39;s normal, and I have had girlfriends. Nothing I haven’t seen before.”<br />
<br />
That was a lie. It wasn’t the first time Dan had been with a naked woman, but this wasn’t a naked woman, it was a naked Siya, and Siya was a cut above. She was a bronze statue to a fertility goddess, and now she wasn’t alone, and Dan had his hands all over the other.<br />
<br />
Siya looked away, her undressing slowed with nerves, but only allowing Mila more time to eye her up. Siya was more than just like a sister, always had been, Siya was the kind of person Dan had felt comfortable relaxing with, felt comfortable just being with, comfortable making mistakes around, and part of that still lingered. Mila knew her sister would never judge her, not about her attitude, her curiosity, and especially her body. <br />
<br />
She wondered if her nipples were going to be that dark, and without thinking she took off the oversized, manish top, looking at herself, looking DOWN at herself. The soft brown figure was much the same, slight rolls only accentuating her femenine figure, adding a layer of inviting plushness. Her breasts heaved with each breath, jiggled under the slightest provocation, and were peaked with a rich and deep brown, accentuating the tawny mass. They were new, very new, and fun even in concept, but they had nothing compared to what came next. <br />
<br />
Pulling their pants down, Mila at last laid eyes at the concentrated darkness around their vagina. Their. Vagina. It was hard to see, sitting at the bottom and hidden behind thick thighs, but she felt it, and the more she thought about it the more it responded. She wanted to touch it, wanted to explore the tingling folds, but more than that she wanted to play with something else.<br />
<br />
Siya was nude too, her nerves melting to just a slight blush that reddened her cheeks, her eyes more hungry that Mila’s in how they scanned over every inch. They shared a smile, as Siya slipped into the stream, inviting her sister in. a tentative Mila moved forward, stepping into the stream, at her sister’s side.<br />
<br />
For a moment the two just stood there, both equally aware that, despite what they were telling themselves, this wasn’t normal. Siya stood there, hands on a scrubber, moving towards her twin and pressing the soap-sodden mass against her, embarrassment now pushing her eyes anywhere but on her doppleganger, eyes glazing over. Mila was, by contrast, burdened by the reality of the moment, that she was Dan, that Dan was a girl, and that Dan was currently in a shower with his figurative - and now literal - sister. His heart thumping in his throat, his hands came to rest on her sister’s, the fidgeting fingers idling.<br />
<br />
“Wash my back?” Mila asked. Siya nodded. “Make sure you don’t overdo it. Very sensitive skin now, like yours, right?” Siya nodded again, something else in her expression. Regret? No. Something about Siya was telling Mila she was very into this, but just holding it all back. Conflict? Yes, but that was unhelpful. WHY was she conflicted? WHY was she conflicted NOW?<br />
<br />
Mila turned, Siya lingered, but as Mila turned to ask if she was okay she started rubbing the soap into Mila’s back. Mila moved under the water, the warmth highlighting every nook and curve, every aspect of her outspilling femininity, but even then Mila could still sense something about her sister. Without warning she turned again, wanting to say something, catching Siya’s hand withdrawing away. All at once, every question Mila had crumbled, and she let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Three years ago, when Mila was dating someone for the first time, she went to Dan to talk about an odd conflict, one he felt an echo of there. She had fidgeted on the edge of his bed, while he sat there, reassuring her nerves were fine, as she explained that she wanted to spend every moment hugging their partner, but every time they came near Siya just froze. <br />
<br />
“I can’t stop fantasising about it,” she had admitted, face glowing, “but the second they get near I just, I can’t not feel like a perv.” On that occasion Dan just told the partner to just hug her a few times, break the boundaries, but only after asking first. This, Mila thought, was going to require something a little bold.<br />
<br />
“Your turn?” Mila asked, beaming. Siya looked up, nodding, a smile sneaking back onto her face.<br />
<br />
Mila re-soaped the scrubber, but unlike her sister she didn’t hesitate. This was normal, Mila told herself, sisters around the world do this every day. She rested a hand on Siya, on her shoulder, the scrubber sliding up and down, vigorous but not too abrasive, letting the sisterly glow on her face flow into her actions. Siya first looked worried, her heart and breathing increasing, but as she settled something else emerged. As Mila began cleaning low Siya began relaxing, the smile returning to full bloom. <br />
<br />
Turning back around, a blushing but smiling Siya gestured with one arm, half raising it, but stool too shy to ask. Mila just raised it the rest of the way herself, scrubbing her pit, forcing herself on the other. With that clear Siya and Mila giggled, the sisters relaxing into one another, relaxing together at last, letting their instincts take over. Mila kissed her twin on the cheek, saying something benign, but only getting the first few sounds, before the words were stalled in her mouth, interrupted by Siya’s lips, by their first kiss.<br />
<br />
Dirty Shower<br />
Mila drifted out of the kiss, her world spinning. She battled vertigo and a thumping heart to comprehend the reality of what just happened, left staring at her sister. <br />
<br />
Siya had a delicate smile, her eyes alight, but there was - as always - something else. Mila looked on, through the saccharine nature of her sister, seeing her smile for the facade it was. Once again her sister was swimming in uncertainty, trying her best to project her confidence, but that never worked on her, not as Mila, and definitely not as Dan.<br />
<br />
Still, Siya’s hands held onto Mila, her grasp firm, dominant. As Mila returned to reality her body lit up, the new softness and smoothness of her new body, the new breasts, the new gap, all very unignorable. Mila was left stammering again, words of protest lost, though now not to her sister’s kiss or frantic motions. They were stood there, staring at each other, both knowing how very wrong this all was, both desperate for it to continue.<br />
<br />
Mila thought over the moment time and time again, the complicated mess of powers imbalances, relationships, and their long history together. In the past it was made so pure by the sheer lack of sexual intimacy, but that was back in the past, in Dan’s limited world without the Chronivac. Right now he was one half of two beautiful twins, standing in a shower, both longing for each other. Every protest he had was being outshone by a new force, begging for them to just get on with it and fuck.<br />
<br />
The tingling in Urmila’s loins was more of a throbbing, heat and wetness beyond the water flowing over them. She tried to stop it, tried to hesitate, but Siya pressed her lips on again, and all resistance faded. <br />
<br />
I don’t want to think about it, Mila thought, I don’t want to think about anything, I just want it to take it’s course.<br />
<br />
Siya was a greedy kisser, lips rubbing on Mila’s tongue pressed into her mouth, the sounds slipping out over the flow of water. Her hands slipped around Mila’s sides, grasping her sister, who could only hold her dainty hands aloft, her turn to not know where to put them. Mila felt their soft torsos smushed together, smooth and wet, the mental image only turned ny the feeling of them, of their bodies, drown skin smoothing…<br />
<br />
Tingle-tingle…<br />
<br />
Mila recoiled. The heat down below had given way to something, and it kind of felt like peeing, or that she had peed and was just noticing. For the first time she touched the softness of her folds, checking for something she felt must have gone wrong, only to shudder with a second wave of it. Siya, looking on, chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I thought I peed.” Mila said, her sister looking on, bemused. The moment of intensity passed, reality and the gravity of the situation slamming once again, and Dan, through Mila’s eyes, saw the reflection of their new self stood there, under the stream of water. She had hardened nipples, like her own, her fidgeting posture broadcasting the mutual heat. Mila knew this was wrong, so very long, but, as she reapproached, also way to late to change. Their passions were wild monsters, and this was now inevitable. <br />
<br />
Mila entered grabbing range and was pulled into Siya’s embrace, lost to kissing and writhing as their hands smoothed over their wet bodies, exploring each other and themselves, softness pressed together. Mila soon hit the cold tile behind there, a hungry Siyapressing her down, escaping the kiss to a loud moan as the older twin began biting and sucking the younger’s neck. Mila bit her own lip, trying to stymie her noises, only muffling them, as the more veteran Siya attacked the familiar frame. Her hands landed on her sister’s breasts, loosing another loud moan.<br />
<br />
Mila blinked, the sight unreal in how hot it was. Her breasts, HER breasts, shining like bronze, kissed and suckled by Siya herself. She was still hesitant, didn’t know where to put her hands, but she didn’t need to. The look in Siya’s eyes told her that she had planned for this, had fantasised about it for longer than Dan could’ve known, and she knew exactly where to go. <br />
<br />
The growing warmth in Mila’s loins, wet and hungry, was at last teased by Siya’s hand, her fingers brushing it, while Siya’s mouth still latched onto Mila’s breast. Mila responded with delicate ministrations, pulling her head up, but pushing her head against the impose to watch the show. She was rubbing on it, exploring Mila’s folds, the usual awkwardness in Siya’s eyes lost to pure lust. That image sat on the forefront of Mila’s mind, mixing with wave after wave of pleasure brought Mila back down, sliding against the tile, barely able to gasp.<br />
<br />
Siya slid into her sister, and for the first time they felt the strangeness an satisfaction of having someone actually inside you. They were hungry for it, their hips moving with the rhythm of the thrusting, eyes glazing, lost to the trance. The sexual pleasure was beyond words, tingling electrifying from cunt to fingertips, Mila controled by the new nature overtaking their body. They used their hands at last, grabbing their sister’s arm, breathing out impassioned nonsense as the thrusting slid in deeper and deeper. It was near, both of them could feel it, both of them were exploring for it, and as the tips of Siya’s fingers touched it at last Mila exploded with pleasure.<br />
<br />
That, a voice spoke in Mila’s mind, was the G-spot. <br />
<br />
She couldn’t last, the electric pleasure, hot and consuming, was too much, even for a veteran. She grasped the silky skin of her sister, letting her pussy spasm and hips buckle into an orgasm. The last thing they saw, glimpsed in a last effort, was  Siya’s eyes at her breast, staring up at her.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
She must have blacked out, but only for a moment, coming to with Siya smiling, stroking her hair. She muttered something, but it may as well be in hindi. Still, she could tell, both from the smile, and the way Siya’s hands explored Mila’s pussy, what was happening. She was proud of herself, proud of making Mila cum, and was so proud she was explaining the orgasm back to Mila. Even now, even in the hottest moment of their lives, Mila was ever the cutest and unabashed nerd.</p>
