<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ay ay ay Dónde empezar&quot; sighed Sofia, as Alice had come to realise her daughter had a tenancy to flip between English and Spanish, sometimes without her knowing, but that only made Alice more proud, knowing that her daughter knew not only one but TWO languages, and spoke both very well &quot;ok hon, do you think that you could explain the whole&quot; said Linda as she gestured her belly ballooning outward, Sofia chuckled sadly as she rested her hands either side of her belly, watching in fascination as a two week old sized foot bulged out above her naval before disappearing.<br />
<br />
&quot; when I lived in my home town, it was me mama and papa up until I was 17, when they told me I was going to be a big sister, and then two weeks ago, my Hermano Bebe was born&quot; said Sofia, suddenly realising Max and Linas confused looks &quot;oh sorry, my baby brother&quot; she smiled as she petted the side of her maternal swell &quot;Mama and Charlie had to stay in hospital for a while, something about a complication when he was born?, I&#39;m unsure, but the day we whent to go and pick mama and bebe Charlie, there was a woman who waved down papa, asking to talk&quot; she said with a shiver, remembering how the woman eyed her, almost like merchandice, unfortunately she had nor heard their conversation, being as she had her headphones in at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;After the woman left, papa continued towards the hospital yet...he seemed, afraid...Once we arrived mama and bebe Charlie were put into the car, mama and papa sat up front, while I was asked to hold the baby in the back, after that I remember....a horn, then the ca-&quot; stuttered Sophie as she began to sob, but she held her hand out as Alice whent to comfort her &quot;once me and Charlie were free from the wrek, I could hear voices asking had they found the children, saying to grab us dead or alive, that we were high value targets&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I took off running with my baby brother, I didn&#39;t know where too but I knew that we had to run, mama and papa they-...they didn&#39;t make it&quot; she said in a low sad voice before continuing &quot;ever since I turned 16, iv had a....condition, its how I got my job in babysitting, see I can....take newbors and young children into my womb&quot; said Sofia as she looked away blushing, and then Alice understood, she had inherited her mothers gift, being as she was born of a one night stand and not taken in like Alice&#39;s other broods it made sense that she would inherit her ability.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I didn&#39;t think and....put him inside me, so he would be safe, I just hoped that he wouldn&#39;t grow so quickly, especially not THIS BIG&quot; said Sofia as she lifted her large belly up and then letting it go, getting a wild flurry of kicks in responce &quot;but anyway I snuck into a clothing shop and stole, theis clothes.....and some money&quot; she said looking down ashamed &quot;and got a cab to come to LA, to find you, and now, well you know the rest&quot; she said as she waddled over to the sofa infront of the fireplace and gazed into the flames, cerressing her belly, awaiting her mothers decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know that poor girl had gone through so much&quot; said Lina as she looked over at Sofia &quot;yeah, but who was after her and her brother&quot; Asked Max &quot;if they wanted her that badly that they....were prepared to kill to get her, the question is, how far are they willing to go&quot; he said as he put his hand on Linas belly for reassurance, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to think  she&#39;s more than welcome to stay for as long as she likes...forever if she wants, but at the end of the day she&#39;s your daughter&quot; said Linda looking towards Alice.<br />
<br />
Alice drummed her fingers on her belly, looking at her daughter, she knew how scary it was to discover their unique ability, she had been lucky when she came to this hospital, where she met her lovers, she had people she could look to for help, but Sofia hadn&#39;t been as lucky, she saw their gift as a curse, instead of a gift, she needed guidance....and Alice was the only one who could give it to her &quot;ok, she&#39;s going to stay for as long as she likes, as her mother I will take responsibility for her&quot; said Alice only to be given a questioning look from Lina and Linda &quot;like hell you are, I haven&#39;t known Sofia long but if she&#39;s your daughter, then like it or not she&#39;s my daughter as well&quot; said Linda, Lina nodding in agreement, Max also nodding.<br />
<br />
Then before Alice could get up Linda leaned in to whisper in her ear &quot;let me go and tell her....I have another bit of news that will chear her up as well, well it won&#39;t be little for long&quot; giggled Linda as she walked over and sat down by Sofia, Alice was left wide eyed at what she had been told, shaking her head and chuckling she turned to Max and Lina &quot;Max, Honey can you please start on dinner, there are a few mouths that need feeding&quot; she giggled petting her belly &quot;sure thing love, any requests?&quot; Asked Max, suddenly all three women&#39;s heads spun to look at him &quot;spaghetti bolognese!&quot; They all called in unison getting a little laugh out of Sofia, Max thwn walked over to her and knelt down with his head on the back of the sofa &quot;and what about you missy, anything special?&quot; He asked, getting a silent few moments as Sofia thought, before her eyes widened and she practically started bouncing with excitement &quot;enchiladas enchiladas!&quot; She chanted with a wide smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Verry well, resteront el Max is open for service&quot; called Max as he did a mock bow and headed for the kitchen behind the divider &quot;thanks papa&quot; called Sofia before she gasped and covered her mouth, tears threatened to overflow her eyes as she then wrapped her arms around herself and began to cry &quot;oh honey&quot; cooed Linda as she opened her arms, which Sofia immediately let herself be embraced by, leaning into Linda&#39;s warmth as she cried.<br />
<br />
Max turned on the oven as he herd poor Sofias sobs from the living room, as well as Linda&#39;s voice giving her reassurance, just then two sets of lips kissed his cheeks, as well as two bellies pressed against him, turning he saw Alice and Lina gazing at him, with a mischievous look in their eyes, either they had done something or were in the process of planning something &quot;baby, you know you love us..&quot; started Alice, Max immediately knowing where this was going &quot;what do you need me to do&quot; he sighed with a smile &quot;we have a surprise planned for Sofia but-&quot; started Lind only to be cut off with a deep kiss from Max, who then turned and did the same to Alice who Moaned into his kiss, then he pulled away &quot;one that&#39;s for just now, two that was also a taster for later tonight if you want and three...yes il keep her distracted&quot; chuckled Max as he shooed his two pregnant girlfriends out of the kitchen &quot;we&#39;ll hold you to that&quot; Moaned Alice seductively as she swayed her ass slowly from side to side as she and Lina waddled down the hall, leaving poor Max red in the face.</p>
