<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not wanting to wait another minute, Jake rushed up the stairs and found himself in a short hallway with three doors. He opened the one closest to him, hoping to find Mr. Henderson&#39;s bedroom, but was disappointed to find a small library instead. He opened the next door and... nope, just a supply closet. He opened the third door at the end of the hall and- &quot;Yes!&quot; Jake punched the air in celebration. He stepped inside and took in his surroundings; there was an unmade queen-sized bed with an oak nightstand, next to it was a matching set of a redwood wardrobe and a dresser, an opened door revealing a master bathroom, and finally (and much to Jake&#39;s delight) stood a full-body mirror across from the foot of the bed.<br />
Tingling with excitement, Jake walked over to the mirror and, for the first time, took a good look at himself. Seeing his new body all at once like this made him realize just how put-together and serious his teacher looked. Jake ran a meaty hand through his curls, despite the fact that his head was full of white hairs, making Sullivan&#39;s chestnut brown hair look ashy and dull, his hair was surprisingly thick. He once again rubbed the salt-and pepper stubble, Jake could hardly grow peach fuzz in his own body, so getting to have a full chin of five o&#39;clock shadow was thrilling all on its own.<br />
It was finally the moment of truth. Jake was practically bursting at the seams as he slipped off the tweed jacket and threw it aside. Now he could see how his arms filled the blue dress shirt&#39;s sleeves. While Sullivan wasn&#39;t nearly as muscular as Jake&#39;s father, Adam, it was clear he had some bulk. Jake grabbed the bottom of the argyle sweater and pulled it over his head, throwing it on top of the discarded blazer. He turned to the side to get a better view of his new torso then looked down and tapped his belly a couple of times. Next he pulled out the tucked in shirt and unbuttoned it, revealing a tank top that clung lightly to his body and a furry chest. Jake looked in the mirror and grinned, seeing his middle age teacher slowly strip down while knowing that that was him in the mirror was a fantasy come true. He took a couple steps back, sat down on the bed, and took of his brown loafers. He held the shoes in his hands, admiring their size; Mr. Henderson was around 6&#39; tall, and his feet clearly reflected that. Jake pulled the socks off his feet and found that his toes had the same tufts of brown hairs as his knuckles did. He wiggled his manly toes, all the while grinning ear to ear. He stood back up and undid his pants, letting them drop to the floor and stepping out of them and closer to the mirror.<br />
&quot;A briefs man, I see,&quot; Jake said to himself, &quot;I&#39;m more of a boxers guy myself, but I guess not anymore,&quot; he chuckled as he stripped of the tank top. Standing there, in nothing but briefs, Jake felt incredible. He pet the hairs that covered his stomach and chest, which was firm if undefined; he cupped his paunch, loving the way it felt in his hands; he flexed his arms and was pleasantly surprised when the otherwise average biceps sprung into life. Sullivan Henderson had clearly been a fit man before his teaching job made him more sedentary. Jake turned his back to the mirror and gave his ass a squeeze, it was full and unexpectedly firm. Turning again to face the mirror he inspected his crotch; a more-than-average bulge stretching the briefs&#39; fabric. He slipped his thumbs under the waistband, &quot;Well old man, let&#39;s see what you got!&quot; he exclaimed as he pulled the underwear down in one swift move. And there he stood, Sullivan Henderson in all his glory, and all for Jake.<br />
Jake felt his blood rise as he fondled his new equipment. His member slowly swelled as he cupped his balls with one hand, letting the other explore his body. Surrounding the full-masted erection was a thick bush of pubes streaked with gray like all the other hair on his body. Falling back onto the bed, Jake allowed his hands to explore every nook and cranny of his skin; a tingling sensation filled him as he gingerly played with his abundant body hair. He grabbed the shaft of his dick and began pumping while he continued to fondle as much of his glorious new body as he could. Feeling the pressure build up inside of him, Jake arched his back, the bed creaking under his weight as cum exploded over his hairy torso. Almost unconsciously, Jake reached up to his lips and licked some of the ejaculate off. To him, it tasted like pure manhood.<br />
<br />
Basking in the afterglow of male pleasure, Jake said to himself, &quot;I could live like this forever,&quot; his voice husky and breathy, thick with an almost blissful tone.</p>
