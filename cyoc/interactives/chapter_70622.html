<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So it went for the first few weeks of college. Vince and Travis were much too preoccupied by the new way of life to think about sex. But <br />
each night, about the time they changed for bed, they would both feel something pulling at the back of their minds.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At first, it was a feeling like you wanted to snack on something. Vince invited Travis down to the 24-hour mart on campus to cure their <br />
munchies. But no amount of snacking made it go away, and the alone time only made the feelings stronger.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then, it became furtive glances in compromising positions. Vince found himself staring at Travis's crotch a lot. Travis saw quite a lot of <br />
Vince's butt.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By the third week, they had quick thoughts of sex whenever they first saw each other, but these died down almost immediately. Neither <br />
metioned anything and Vince blamed it on his recent dry spell.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The fourth week brought wet dreams of each other. Each would wake up to the alarm, look across the room at each other, then look <br />
down in shame only to see pre stains on their sheets.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The fifth week was full of daydreams about each other and uneasiness in the shared room. By the sixth week, Vince and Travis were <br />
masturbating to the thought of each other between classes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The seventh week was the last straw. There was a band playing at a campus club and both boys were going to see them. Taking turns <br />
in the bathroom, they couldn't help thinking about each other while they rubbed their bodies.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Vince was in the shower, rubbing his crotch and thinking about Travis, when said roommate realized he'd forgotten his watch on the <br />
sink. He decided that a quick grab for the watch would be okay, besides, there was a curtain on the shower.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Travis opened the door quietly, not that Vince heard it in his little fantasy. He walked over to the sink and picked up the watch. While he <br />
was putting it on, he heard the sound of soap squishing quickly as if...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, T-Travis,&quot; Vince moaned/whispered.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Travis couldn't believe his ears. Did Vince just moan his name while beating off in the shower? As if in answer, Vince moaned again, <br />
audibly this time. Yep, no mistaking it, he was beating off to the thought of Travis.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The moans of his roommate made him instantly hard, so throbbingly erect that his jeans hurt him. He had to take them off. Then the <br />
sight of his bulging boxers made him almost spill his load right there. He took his boxers off and sat on the toilet for relief.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell,&quot; Travis thought, &quot;We might as well fantasize about each other together.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two were now mutually masturbating. Travis easily worked into the same rythm as Vince so that his strokes matched the squelches <br />
he heard from the shower.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This paradise seemed to go on forever for Travis, but not long enough. Suddenly, the squishing got faster, faster, faster...stop. Before <br />
Travis realized what was going on, the water was turned off and Vince stepped out, licking cum from his hand.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The two secret lovers stared at each other in shock for a long moment, then reacted at the same time. Vince pulled the curtain around <br />
him, Travis tripped trying to pull his pants back up, and both started spouting excuses.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just—&quot;<br />
&quot;This isn't what—&quot;<br />
&quot;My watch—&quot;<br />
&quot;Playboy—&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought—&quot;<br />
&quot;I want you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Travis asked. Vince had dropped the curtain and stood naked before him, gazing longingly into his eyes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I don't know why, but ever since I met you I've wanted you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but there's just something about you that I've never felt for a guy before. I don't know what it is, but I know that I want you...Do <br />
you want me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Travis exploded.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He dropped his pants and ran across the small bathroom to embrace Vince. The two hugged long and hard, their cocks rubbing against <br />
each other. Travis was still very hard, not having been released, but Vince's was quickly getting erect again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, look, I let myself get off before you even got a chance,&quot; Vince said, smiling playfully. &quot;Well, take your shirt off and I'll help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis giggled as Vince got down on his knees in front of him. He sniffed Travis's crotch and sighed at the musky scent. Even though <br />
he had just showered, the lust and sex made Travis pump testosterone and adrenaline through his system, making him smell as horny <br />
as he was.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Vince had never sucked dick before, had never even thought of it; but somehow this was just right for him. He started with a long, slow <br />
lick up Travis's shaft. When he got to the head, he lightly suckled it and flicked his tongue at the slit. Travis moaned in soft approval <br />
before Vince went to town. He took as much of the organ into his mouth as he could. While he felt it was natural, his body wasn't <br />
accustomed to having a full cock down its throat.<br />
<br />
Travis&nbsp;was&nbsp;in&nbsp;heaven. He had wanted to do this since highschool, but had never met anyone like Vince. He didn't know why, but ever <br />
since he saw Vince he wanted to take him. At first, Vince hadn't seemed like the submissive type Travis wanted, but around him, Vince <br />
seemed to be soft and willing to do anything.</p>
