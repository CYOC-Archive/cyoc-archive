<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You, and your brothers looked around for a bit, and suddenly you saw something inhuman, and stood up. &quot;What&#39;s up Drac?&quot; Onio asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw something odd.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Like someone that shouldn&#39;t be here as in a human. Just chase and kill it and get back to the door if you really are hell bent on this witch woman.&quot; Xide said<br />
<br />
&quot;It didn&#39;t seem human, I think, but we can&#39;t just leave the door unguarded. Who knows what that will end up like.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Why yes indeed my fellow familiar, or should I say familiars considering the whole gang here.&quot; A voice said, and you felt an unusual weight on your back, as if someone was mounted on top of your back.<br />
<br />
All at once all heads turned to see an anthro female wolf dressed in a pitch black jumpsuit that matched her black fur. You could notice that she had multiple sets of breasts too pretty sizable ones too, that got smaller when going down her body. She was also equipped with twin daggers, and had a green leather suit over the jumpsuit with a hood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello boys, might I assume that you three are the newcomers for our mistress. I assume she told you about me, I patrol here regularly, and let&#39;s just say that I can attest to being a little bit naughty during my first experiences here.&quot; The wolf said disappearing into a black smoke.<br />
<br />
You felt your pop a boner when she said &quot;naughty&quot; and couldn&#39;t help to notice you had a sheath for your now massive cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that I can even a hydra isn&#39;t exactly immune to my subduction, or maybe it&#39;s just because you&#39;re still used to human hormones, and I just turn you on in general.&quot; The wolf said, and was standing in front of you with a smug smile, and looking at your dick.<br />
<br />
You then lied down almost stumbling over your cock as it fell back into your sheath. &quot;How do I respond to this?&quot; You thought to yourself, and then Xide spoke up. &quot;Who are you exactly?&quot; Xide asked<br />
<br />
&quot;He, names Shade, and you are?&quot; The wolf, Shade asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Draconioxide, I&#39;m Drac, to my left is Onio, and the one who asked you the question is Xide.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, when mistress talked about another familiar here I just had to meet them. Honestly I didn&#39;t expect a hydra, especially since she only used the singular form. But I think she&#39;s just being herself today, I honestly was expecting her to be a bit more joyous about getting a new familiar, did you do anything to her that could be described as rebellious.&quot; Shade asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet!&quot; Xide said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Xide remember I don&#39;t want to mistreat either of you, but talking like that isn&#39;t the best especially now.&quot; You said, and Xide turned his head<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways what my brother was trying to say is that we were wondering if there was a loophole to being a familiar. We were wondering if you could tell us if there is one.&quot; Onio said <br />
<br />
&quot;Loophole huh, well there is one, and mistress doesn&#39;t realize it as much as she thinks she does. We must do what she commands, but if she isn&#39;t specific we can have a long bit of freedom in what we do. For example if she told us to kill something and nothing else, then we could literally lay down and do nothing because she wasn&#39;t specifically referring to anything else. Also fun fact, if mistress dies from natural causes then we get a small dose of, complete immortality, we won&#39;t die no matter what, and we currently don&#39;t age at all.&quot; Shade said <br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, and what if she dies from an unnatural cause?&quot; Xide asked<br />
<br />
&quot;We will slowly die an excruciatingly painful death, or so I&#39;ve heard.&quot; Shade said <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey uh, just wondering what did you mean earlier by &#39;naughty&#39; Shade?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Drac, when I was summoned I was male like you are now. I was a bit too rebellious and wanted freedom, so mistress turned me female, and gave my body a few physical enhancements. She says my job is an assassin, and also as a subductress too with the body she gave me.&quot; Shade said <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I know this may sound a bit prideful, but why weren&#39;t you angry with her, and why are you acting so loyal to her now?&quot; Onio asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she accelerated my feminine hormone development, and soon enough I was an anthro sexy female wolf standing nude next to a witch, and said witch threatened to do something even worse to me. On top of that she transformed me so effortlessly and that alone scares me, and on top of that she can track us because we are her familiars.&quot; Shade said <br />
<br />
&quot;What did she threaten to do?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She threatened to put me into heat, which she did quite a few times. Then she said that she would find another familiar and make me his sex slave, but you are currently way too big for that. Finally I shut up when she...&quot; Shade began but fell silent <br />
<br />
&quot;She what?&quot; Xide asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She used magical energy to make me pregnant, and I actually am right now. I become pregnant 3 times over the span of a few years as punishment for insolence. If you are wondering how that works then consider that I don&#39;t appear pregnant now, but I just gave birth 3 months ago, and I am now pregnant again magically after that three months. Actually I am two weeks pregnant as of today, and this is my second pregnancy of the three.&quot; Shade said <br />
<br />
&quot;And this is why Xide should watch his mouth when talking about stuff to the witch, or mistress as you put it.&quot; Onio said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don&#39;t disagree with Xide, but I just think he should hold his tongue from time to time.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...I guess,&quot; Xide said <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I&#39;ll see if we could possibly visit you sometime, where exactly are your pups?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Asleep, I check on them frequently, and thanks to a little teleportation magic with that smoke I used with you earlier, I can. On top of that my clothes are built for stealth, and adapt to my environment like invisibility.&quot; Shade said,&quot;My pups and I live at the end of that right hall to the left on the end, and I suspect you may be living close too. Anyways have to go check again, bye you three.&quot; Shade said as she disappeared into a dark mist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that means that we&#39;re going to be in the same boat as Shade if we try to attempt something like rebel, or escape.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, just thinking about being pregnant with a clutch of eggs is horrific to me, but oddly interesting.&quot; Onio said <br />
<br />
&quot;Kinky bastard,&quot; Xide commented<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up Xide, we all felt our erection when Shade first appeared. Besides I really do find it interesting because we&#39;re a hydra, and not human like we were.&quot; Onio said <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait if you two just grew out of my shoulders and have no memories and different personalities, doesn&#39;t that mean I was the only one who was truly formerly human here considering am the only one with human memories, and experiences?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t remember a thing past waking up like a head, and Onio shouldn&#39;t have any knowledge about being human, or female especially.&quot; Xide said<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay shut up! I personally wouldn&#39;t mind if we were female, I mean it&#39;s something interesting to think about at least. Especially when considering giving birth, and to a clutch of eggs not like mammalian live birth.&quot; Onio said <br />
<br />
&quot;True, but let&#39;s not make it an option.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh certainly no, we could always ask Shade, she was male and maybe more open to talk about that sort of thing.&quot; Onio said <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but Onio know that if we do then you will be the one talking.&quot; Xide said<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree with Xide here Onio, I can&#39;t doubt that your right, but interested in a PREGNANT woman&#39;s body is your own fetish not mine.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Geez okay,&quot; Onio said<br />
<br />
Suddenly down the hall you saw the witch again, and she was holding something, ans giving you a smile, that was happy and almost seemed creepy. &quot;Greetings Draconioxide, I hope nothing much happened while I was away.&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing at all, except for meeting Shade, she seems nice.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good, I knew she would get along with you, anyways I have a gift for you like I promised. A spell that will change your gender, but it&#39;s optional, if you don&#39;t want it I could always alter something else if you want.&quot; The witch said </p>
