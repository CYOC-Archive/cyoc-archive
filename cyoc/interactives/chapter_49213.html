<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Farmland Security and the plans they had for the two friends were a for sure thing, and both Bob and Kevin knew they needed to put some plans of their own into the works. If what hey heard would happen to what all they owned, if they were allowed to return they would be paupers. As it was they were wealthy men, families grown and out of the house, they did as they pleased, of had until receiving of the draft notice letter.<br />
<br />
Quick legal action of transferring the four residences to the names of the elder children would keep the properties in the family. Their wealth of investments were more of a difficulty to have changed, the government limiting such transfer of funds without taxation or special registration of larger amount they would tax it and still leach it.<br />
<br />
Days were few and time short, they need only to pack an overnight satchel for this trip, as once they were registered at where they would sleep, the use of clothing would be unlikely.<br />
<br />
The day came, a Thursday and come the morning ferry boat they would leave their plush surroundings and take the short trip to Gaylord, Michigan and there walk one-way, joining many as equals to live and give to the Farmland. So that was their plan, but come the morning a cold front moved in from Canada, bring with it choppy water, high waves, gale force winds and not a ferry to deliver them to the mainland and their appointment with Uncle Sam.<br />
<br />
The weather and waves remained high until that Sunday afternoon, when the two friends boarded a ferry and took one bouncy ride to Mackinaw City, were there they could get a bus to take them to Gaylord and the government offices. This is what they expected, but upon walking off the ferry, the men from Farmland Security were there, they had a bus loaded with those thought as conscious objectors to what they government subsidiary department had as plans for them to serve and give service.<br />
<br />
Warned of not having come on the day as planned, weather, waves, and storms were not the problem of government, but the not presenting of selves to the Farmland Board was an illegal act. Handcuffs, ankle cuff and chains added to each their person was just the beginning of ill treatment to come. Hustled upon the special bus, toss into a seat, the driver given the OK, the bus moved on, stopping to retrieve a few more saddened people before the unloading at the rear doors to Farmland Security offices.<br />
<br />
Kevin was one of the first they took off the bus, dragging him roughly to stand with others in a line, they humiliated as two men used razor knives and cut, removing all clothing before the chained and naked people were led inside the building. Cries of insult as their clothing was turned into shredded rags were met with jabs of electric cattle prods. The women or men arguing with those doing the first of many more insults to come felt the first stuns of pain they would know while walking the earth in an animal form.<br />
<br />
The next group were walked in another door, they allowed their clothing and not as humiliated as were the first fifteen people and Kevin.<br />
<br />
A third and final group included Bob and seven others, as they like the first group were lined up and rip, cut, and deprived of their clothing. Told then to walk along and remain silent, the thought remembered of the sheep going silently before the shearers. Once inside the group was herded into a small, but warmly heated room. <br />
<br />
Long terrible minutes passed, until the door to the room opened at there stood a man looking like a doctor, he announcing that one at a time would go with him for a short physical to ensure of generally good health before the inoculations would begin. The taking of the only female in the group of eight people, had those men there begin talking, asking what sordid plans if any anyone of them heard of what deportment they all might find themselves living within.<br />
<br />
Bob remained silent, less by speaking he should lay ruin to what the letter informing him of induction said, telling Bob and Kevin as each would be of the Equine groups. <br />
<br />
Rumors ran wild when the doctor returned and asked for those men there who appeared as overweight, they along with the woman would be inducted into the Swine Division Program. That was bad news for four men each with sporting a fair size of a beer gut spare tire about their midsection. As they were herded off out the door, one man made a comment about being bored and could boar having some fun. His comment rebutted by one of the guards, as he remarked, that a swine herd had need of more sows than boars, and the boar for their herd was a lifetime carryover. <br />
<br />
That changed his tune, and the men taken with him knew they when finished changing, were to be sows and live a different and crude life giving birth, letting suck piglets, and as men, humiliated in silence every day they had to live as do pigs.<br />
<br />
Hours passed, and those there with Bob were sweating with worry, wondering what horrid changes awaited them.<br />
<br />
When the door swung open, a different man stood there looking like and dressed in surgical garb. He with his mask on, pointed to the two men other than Bob, and informing them they were the chosen two to enter the Equine Zoophytic society.  He added, telling the two men of their coming duties was as Zebra stallions, and doing as would stud animals, breed, making not zebras, but with horses to make Zorse mules.<br />
<br />
That left Bob alone and waiting, he had not long to wait as when the door opened, what stood there was two pretty women, each in silence eyed Bob, as if visually giving him a physical. They said only yes to everything they checked, fondling him into sporting an erection they noted, did nod about, and smiled, leading him out of that room, down the chilly hallway, and to a private room of his own.<br />
<br />
Staggering into that room still chained and hobbled, Bob stood gawking at the many photos pasted on the room walls, all of them pictures of horses, draft horses all!</p>
