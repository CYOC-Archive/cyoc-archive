<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan soon learned that the size of one's penis was a sign of dominance.<br />
<br />
Naturally the larger it was the more dominant one was. I guess it was <br />
the excessive testosterone produced by those cantaloupe sized balls <br />
that made them more dominant.<br />
<br />
Dan had not thought of himself as being submissive but when he met <br />
Adriane, his roommate, he learned that he wanted to do what ever he <br />
needed to to make Adriane happy and for the most part that was to be <br />
ridden like the little pussy boy Adriane needed.<br />
<br />
Adriane wrapped his arm around Dan like a big bear protecting his cub <br />
and walked him down to the registrar to get the classes worked out. <br />
Adriane picked Dan's classes. There was cooking, and homemaking, <br />
gardening and other domestic courses for Dan's Mr degree.<br />
<br />
Dan didn't question it at all.<br />
<br />
Adriane then took Dan back to the room and stripped him down to the <br />
bare bear Dan had become.<br />
<br />
Stand there boy. Adriane said. Adriane took out a razor and began to <br />
shave all of the body hair from Dan's head to toe.<br />
<br />
Dan was as smooth as when he was born.<br />
<br />
A tear began to form in his eye because he really liked the fur but he <br />
loved Adriane more.<br />
<br />
Now give us a spin. Adriane ordered.<br />
<br />
Dan stood there and began to slowly turn around and when he was facing <br />
the window he noticed that all the men from the wing that faced his <br />
room were looking at this now bare bear. But he wasn't the only one <br />
that was shaved. It seemed that most every room had a chubby boy <br />
spinning just like himself. Belly sticking out and small one foot <br />
penis' just like his.<br />
<br />
Wave hi to your brothers Dan. Everything Adriane said was a command. <br />
It was just that tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
Dan began to give the royal wave to the others as he was watching the <br />
expression on their faces. Just as he noticed their look he realized <br />
that he was standing there stunned just like a deer in the headlights.<br />
<br />
Adriane came up behind Dan and nudge him to the big bed and stripped <br />
his own clothes off.<br />
<br />
Adriane pushed his mammoth hard dick up Dan's back end with no preparation and you could tell by the agony on Dan's face that he was <br />
in severe pain but he kept taking it deeper and deeper. Two full feet <br />
of dick up into his intestines and as it met it's depth it began to <br />
expand in cercumference to the size of a two liter soda bottle.<br />
<br />
For an hour and a half Adriane pumped Dan's ass before he orgasmed up <br />
Dan's hole bloating him like he had been drinking several cases of <br />
beer.<br />
<br />
He was dizzy from the lack of blood to his brain and passed out from <br />
the intense first fuck.<br />
<br />
This would happen several times a day, Dan and Adriane. And at times <br />
when he was passed out from his session with Adriane he would find <br />
himself awake with a stranger pumping his ass. Adriane would leave the <br />
door wide open at times when he was finished fucking his boy leaving <br />
him available for anyone that wanted him.<br />
<br />
The following day Adriane went through Dan's clothes and started <br />
sorting through his clothing. Most all of his clothes were thrown out <br />
except his jock straps, wife beaters and pants were made into daisy <br />
dukes to show off Dan's ass and legs.<br />
<br />
We need to go get you some new clothes. Adriane took Dan to a leather <br />
shop and had him measured for a harness. The one Adriane chose was <br />
locked around Dan's neck with two straps down his front like <br />
suspenders that hitched under his pecs that were harnessed to his neck <br />
strap lifting his perky man boobs. The straps went down and met in a v <br />
at his penis ring where his dick and balls were fed through some metal <br />
rings. A strap went  between his legs and two straps went to around <br />
his hips to a device that spread his ass hole with metal hooks much <br />
like forceps and then back up his back to his neck strap. This device <br />
held open his ass so that there was easier access to Dan's ass hole <br />
and there were also loops that Adriane could lock in a nice size dildo <br />
up Dan's ass keeping him from removing it.<br />
<br />
Adriane also got Dan a pair of leather shorts that in no way met at <br />
the sides. He got extra leather straps to tie the shorts together. He <br />
also got Dan a pair of low rise boots. Not the big work boots that <br />
Adriane and the other men wore he had boy boots in pink. And then <br />
there were several overalls with extra long straps to support the <br />
belly sort of like a belly bra and legs cut extremely short to give <br />
that daisy duke look even in the overalls.<br />
<br />
Dan was in heaven and soon forgot about the chronovac. Even becoming <br />
dumber as he took his house keeping-domestic courses. And by Christmas <br />
Dan and Adriane were expecting their first of many children. Adriane <br />
wanted a big family, he was after all Italian and it was a sin not to <br />
breed excessively. His brothers each had a couple dozen children <br />
easily and he wasn't going to be outdone by them.<br />
<br />
The chronovac became unused and Adriane sold it off to a friend of his <br />
Carlos, who made good use of it.</p>
