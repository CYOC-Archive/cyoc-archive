<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Thief&#39;s Playplace: An antique store with the most ironic name ever. Inside were oddities thousands of years old. This was where Kasi decided to pull of your first (and last) heist.<br />
<br />
Kasi Dirosa was a 16 year old girl with the most masculine figure possible. Most people mistook her for a guy before taking a second look. She had virtually no curves, short bone straight hair, and an atrocious fashion sense. She had been hit on by many girls and at one point considered actually having the sex change. She fell into a depression because of it, and was starting a life of crime today.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s really the shop owner&#39;s fault for naming the store what he did.<br />
<br />
She walked into the store to get a lay of the store. The checkout was to her left, and about 5 aisles of antiques. All she would have to do is pick something and make it out without being spotted. Of course, she had to do this. She didn&#39;t have much of a choice. Her life was terrible, so if she made this money, she would be able to make it better. She looked to see that there waisle:  cameras, and the clerk was looking away to tend to business. Kasi stalked the aisles, which luckily, were marked from cheapest to most expensive. The last aisle was blocked off with a sign that said: &quot;Ask clerk to enter Restricted Aisle&quot;. For a store that was so lax on security, it seemed odd that this one aisle would be so secured.<br />
<br />
Kasi turned to go back to another aisle when she saw something in the restricted aisle: a gold necklace with a large red and blue gem. The tag read $10k, a huge payday if she could make off with it. She grabbed a nearby umbrella with a hook handle and attempted to snag it through a gap in the gate blocking the aisle. After a few attempts and almost dropping it on the floor, kasi got the amulet in a nice hook and pulled it out. It was quite hefty, at least 5 lbs. She slipped the necklace into her shirr and made towards the door.<br />
<br />
As she left the store, she could not help but wonder if she forgot to check something, if there was some sort of security measure she forgot to protect against. She didn&#39;t have anyone on her tail yet, so she believed she was in the clear. It was a long walk home anyway, especially with an extra 5 lbs on her neck.<br />
<br />
Walking across town was always a good experience. She lived in a town full of some of the most unbelievably gorgeous men and women. A 16 year old girl would have the mature body of a 20 year old. Their town was voted #4 in the world of most beautiful natural bodies. And then there was Kasi. She wasn&#39;t exactly bad looking. In fact, if she was a guy, she would be one of the more attractive ones. But compared to the other girls, she was just average. Of course, despite this, Kasi always wished she had a little something extra for her.<br />
<br />
As she was crossing Fitch Avenue, she nearly ran into some girl&#39;s cleavage. The girl&#39;s breasts were bigger than Kasi&#39;s head. She tried to apologize to the girl, but the broad pushed her aside, called her a perv, and ran along. Kasi swore under her breath. &quot;Of course, she can be a bitch because she&#39;s got breasts bigger than her brains. I bet If I had half the breasts of her, I could brapidlyter girl than she ever was.&quot;<br />
<br />
What happened next was a bit too shocking. Her previously flat as paper chest started filling out quite rapidly, stretching out her blue baggy jacket. She didn&#39;t even notice her newly blossoming bosoms until she felt the large gem start to press up against them. Kasi looked down to have her vision obscured by her now b-cup breasts. She nearly fainted as they swelled up in front of her. They started to fill out and stretch her jacket as she hit a small c cup, but they continued to grow. Bigger and bigger they grew, hitting D in no time. Eventually, they started to slow down and stop at a large D cup.<br />
<br />
Kasi could literally not believe her eyes. She thought it was a dream. She thought she was hallucinating. Her new breasts filled out the jacket, and gave her that feminine flair she was looking for. She unzipped her jacket to expose her new body. Her newly giant tits stretched out a now tight t shirt and bra, which now gave her some deep cleavage. She pulled the gem out of her cleavage and inspected it. The gem was different, the swirls if red and blue had shifted, and a touch of green had appeared. It was slightly hot to the touch.<br />
<br />
Kasi removed the necklace in a delayed shock. It had causes her to grow breasts, specifically, breasts half the size of the girl she ran into. &quot;This is fucking insane!&quot; She practically yelled to everyone. Some people looked at the tomboy with big breasts. Kasi could see a couple of guys stating, and a couple of guys getting an erection. She slipped the necklace back around her neck, stuffed the gem down her cleavage, zipped her jacket up, and took off in a mad dash home.<br />
<br />
Which was not a good idea, given her new assets.</p>
