<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly Rei paused as his nose began to twitch, and he picked up the smell of something nearby. Rei has no idea what this was, but it carried the vaguely faint scent of a human creature. &quot;Hmm...&quot; Rei paused and thought to himself,&quot;Was there a survivor? No, I made sure there was none left!&quot;<br />
<br />
However even as Rei denied this possibility he couldn’t rule out the possibility of a random fool wandering through the woods alone for a different reason. Plus the existence of a human still meant a threat to Lyra’s probable clutch of eggs, and Rei couldn’t risk something even so small as a lone human exposing their new home. So Rei looked off in the direction of the scent and growled to himself,&quot;Fine, it’ll be dead soon enough anyways.&quot; He then roared with pride and ran off towards the scent in the distance.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for Rei to locate his prey, but when he located the source of the scent he was awestruck. From the shadows of the trees behind some bushes Rei spotted a lone peasant child, a boy wearing rags and nothing more. &quot;How the hell...? Why is he out here alone?&quot; Rei thought to himself, but then he heard some growls that came from all around both him and the boy.<br />
<br />
Rei then looked behind him, and he saw two normal looking wolves creep towards the boy. The wolves certainly acknowledged Rei’s existence as they eyed him, but they didn’t attack him. &quot;At least these animals know who’s superior here.&quot; Rei thought to himself, but then his attention was drawn back to the boy as wolves emerged from the bushes all around him.<br />
<br />
The boy looked panicked and like he was going to run, but the wolves completely surrounded him on all sides. &quot;Hmph, stupid kid...he probably deserves...&quot; Rei thought, but then the boy cried out,&quot;Help! S...somebody please!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rei paused as a sudden flash of humanity overwhelmed his senses. &quot;I used to fight dragons to prevent this! Why am I just letting it happen?!&quot; Rei thought,&quot;But I have to protect Lyra! If this boy...&quot; Suddenly one of the wolves lunges at the boy and the boy ducked down then cowered as his life was surely about to end.<br />
<br />
It was then a burning rage within Rei sparked into a blazing inferno, and he couldn’t stand to watch this boy suffer any more than what he was. Rei let out the largest and most powerful roar that he had ever produced this far, and he rushed in and swept his claws and tail across the scene around the boy.<br />
<br />
Two of the wolves were ripped apart immediately by Rei’s claws, and two more wolves flew back into the trees just behind him and the boy. The boy stared up at Rei and was petrified of Rei’s appearance, but Instead of killing him on sight Rei snarled,&quot;Boy! Stay down and close your eyes! NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy clinched at Rei’s outburst, but the boy obeyed Rei’s command unquestionably nonetheless. More wolves began to emerge from the surrounding and they began circling the two creatures showing off their sharp canine teeth. However before any wolf got an opportunity to attack Rei let out an enormous roar and with that a stream of searing flames. The wolves all whimpered and some tried to run, but Rei turned his head and scorched the land everywhere around him and the boy, and he left nothing except for charred and burning remains of wolves. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the area within Rei’s range was nothing but dry dirt, and an occasional bolder. Without a second thought after what he had just done, Rei grabbed the boy and took to the air with the boy in his arms. &quot;Oh no! Too high! Too HIGH!!&quot; The boy screamed but then Rei growled,&quot;Calm down, I got you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy then kept quiet as Rei flew through the sky, and then he carried the boy to an area near his cave and he gave the boy a serious sneer and growled,&quot;Okay first off, why the hell are you out here alone!? What made you think that was a bright idea?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy, who looked roughly around 5 years old only responded to this by crying his eyes out. Rei realized quickly that his tone may have upset the boy, especially considering his own massive size in comparison. &quot;Boy, hey boy, are you alright?&quot; Rei asked, but the boy kept crying, and Rei sighed as he had to resort to pity in order to get at least something out of this child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look boy...I’m...sorry for yelling just....for god’s sake please just calm down and tell me what is wrong.&quot; Rei sighed and he facepalmed in embarrassment and thought,&quot;Why have I stooped to this level?&quot; However despite Rei’s own lack of confidence with his actions the boy settled down after this and gave Rei a puzzled look and asked,&quot;Y...you’re.....g...good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei paused when he heard this then he looked down at the boy wondering how he should reply. &quot;Well....I don’t kill kids like you if that’s what you were wondering. But honestly kid why are you out here alone? Where are your parents at, and what do I need to do to get you back to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy paused when Rei asked about his parents, and then his eyes began tearing up again. &quot;Th....they’re.......d...d...&quot; the boy stammered and Rei realized what the boy was about to say and his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to say anything else there boy,&quot; Rei exclaimed,&quot;Were you from an orphanage? Maybe I could take you back?&quot; The boy suddenly hugged Rei’s leg, and Rei paused blushing slightly by this. &quot;Please don’t!! It’s bad!!! Really bad!!!&quot; The boy cried and he began to cry into Rei’s leg.<br />
<br />
Rei paused and thought,&quot;Holy shit! How bad were they to this kid!? I just ate a couple of humans, and even I feel bad right now.&quot; Rei allowed the boy to cry, and suddenly he got an idea that made him smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boy, what if you were to live with me and my mate?&quot; Rei asked and suddenly the boy’s face lit up and he asked,&quot;R...Really?&quot; Rei then held up a claw and said,&quot;Whoa now, don’t think of me as you Dad or anything right now. Before anything can happen I need to ask you some questions. This isn’t a test, so just answer them honestly, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy paused and he nodded,&quot;Uh..okay then...Mr...dragon.&quot; Rei paused then nodded and said,&quot;Okay, so you are aware of what I am, of what our kind does and of what I plan to do. I am a dragon, I kill humans, devour humans and protect myself from them. Can you do the same?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy just looked up at Rei with unsure eyes and he replied,&quot;Uh...d...do I need to?&quot; Rei looked down at the boy and sighed,&quot;Unfortunately....yes, but I promise that I won’t force you to do it. However you will find you must fight for yourself to survive, and I will teach you how to. In other words they will attack you on sight, and you will have to kill in order to live.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy in response gave Rei a slight nod, but still looked unsure. Rei sighed at this then said,&quot;I guess that’s good enough for now, but I will show you just how cruel humans are, and you will learn how to fight. If you accept this then reach out to me, but know you will not be human, you will be raised as one of us. You will hoard treasures from others, kill humans time and time again, and find you will find the woman of your dreams and make her yours the same way I will show you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy nodded to you again and said,&quot;A...anything just please don’t take me back.&quot; The boy then extended his arm, and Rei saw this and smiled. &quot;Good, now hold still...this will hurt for you as it did for me.&quot; Rei exclaimed then the boy closed his eyes and looked away expecting the worse.<br />
<br />
Rei then smiled at this and he opened his mouth, and as quickly as he could he bit the boy and he cried out with pain, but then paused when he saw green scales crawling up his arm. The boy’s body shrank as the scales spread across his body, his fingers forming tiny black tipped claws. <br />
<br />
The boy let out a number of screams and cries while this happened and he was obviously freaking out. &quot;Don’t worry, I’m here for you, just let it happen.&quot; Rei said to the boy and he looked up at Rei then nodded. The scales covered the boy’s torso, and new white scales covered his chest and underbelly. The boy’s head pushed out and formed a muzzle, and his hair fell out of his head. Two tiny black horns then grew out of the back of his head, and the boy’s eyes turned bright yellow.<br />
<br />
Right after that the boy shrank down into his clothes and he began flailing around frantically. As two tiny claws tore through his shirt the boy was now a full weredragon. &quot;Hmm...this isn’t permanent,&quot; Rei thought to himself and then the new weredragon tried to stand up but he couldn’t.<br />
<br />
Rei caught the small dragon before he hit the ground and Rei asked,&quot;Are you okay?&quot; The new weredragon then looked up at Rei and nodded,&quot;I c...cannot w...wawk fow thome weathon.&quot; Rei paused a bit surprised by how the kid spoke to him, and this made Rei ask,&quot;Can you open your mouth? I want to see something.&quot;<br />
<br />
The weredragon opened his mouth and there wasn’t any teeth inside, and this struck Rei as a predicament. The boy would have to revert back to eating like most infants do, and it wasn’t much of a wonder why he couldn’t walk.<br />
<br />
However there was still one big issue on Rei’s mind,&quot;How do I make this permanent? He’s way too young for intercorse, and if he changes back then. That makes things difficult for me and him if he likes being a dragon. Oh what do I do?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The weredragon then ran up on all fours with his tail wagging,&quot;I can wawk wike thith though! Wook!&quot; Rei watcher the boy and smiled,&quot;Heh, good job then kid...I think I’ll call you Kin from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kin paused then smiled and giggled,&quot;Okay! That thoudth gweat!&quot; Rei still watcher him, and took a bit of pride that he was going to raise this hatchling. Rei smiled as he watched Kin run around for a bit, but then suddenly it hit him. There were two ways that the transformation was permanent, and he needed to...</p>
