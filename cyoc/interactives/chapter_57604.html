<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing the televisions showed was the animal planet which happened to be <br />
showing a documentary on big cat: which was about as interesting to the lupmans and <br />
leomans the way humans were interested in depictions of how monkeys acted. <br />
<br />
Naturally some of the leomans were uncomfortable with the program but kept their <br />
opinions to themselves since the majority seemed to find the program mostly enjoyable. <br />
<br />
The light brown Sergeant Bernie Hive was quite happy when the documentary ended and <br />
the challenge was changed an episode of The Underdog Show (the changes in reality had <br />
the cartoon wolf mobster character now went around in the fur strangely enough but not <br />
erased from existence). However this received too many groans from the lupmans who <br />
demanded a challenge change and the nurses complied. <br />
<br />
Three seconds of South Park and the channel changed again. <br />
<br />
The Japanese wolves had never been Otakus, in spite of their Alpha taste in <br />
entertainment... so they really, REALLY wished the leomans would stop asking them inane <br />
questions about the Japanese cartoons being shown on the international channel that the <br />
lupmans had no more clue than the leoman as to the plot (due to the heavy story-line <br />
oriented style of most anime series it really felt like coming to a starting to read a story in <br />
the middle!). <br />
<br />
The cooking channel held everyone's attention, except for those with broken jaws who <br />
found this fate to be rather aggravating. <br />
<br />
Finally came the history channel, which result in the many former gallery wolves presence <br />
in loud voices, &quot;THAT'S NOT HOW THAT HAPPENED!&quot; <br />
<br />
Joy and Ingrid look at the conscious heads of the other, both thinking 'This is gonna be a <br />
long night...' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
1689 August <br />
<br />
Joella walked quite with the cracked and damage gargoyle, looking at the beauty of <br />
Glendale as it had become... truly alive with so many colors... and it could all be gone if her <br />
mothers died before they could finalize it all. <br />
<br />
All that power was HERE, but Joella was no witch, and her mothers were in position to use <br />
all the power around them, 'It must be horrible for them.'<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you've been with the one eyed hunter a long time?&quot; Joella asked.<br />
<br />
Vatican said, &quot;I have been with her since she was taken in by her god father... he extracted <br />
a promise from me that I protect her always, and so I have done so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why aren't you with her right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was with her constantly, it would be unhealthy for her mind, and that would harm her, <br />
thus defeating the purpose of my vow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... So you've been a gargoyle a long time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as I can remember I believe... I am not a taboo gargoyle like Free. Though I have <br />
heard taboo gargoyles do eventually forget their other existence so I can not be certain <br />
without checking the church's records.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Taboo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind ... how long have you been with your guardians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All my life, as long as I can remember.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And how long is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, fair enough... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry my mothers had to hurt you, if you had just left us alone none of this would have <br />
had to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vatican decided it was very wish NOT to try and debate with a child still in the single digit <br />
range about concepts like good, evil, free will, and nurture vs nature. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry, but I made a promise to stay by Marie Cruz's side, and I shall do so, as a <br />
gargoyle must.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.... I understand... promises are very important... it doesn't matter who you give them <br />
to... a promise is a promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that a rule?&quot; Maddex's heads scoffed. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza, &quot;Joella justified the witches utopia that the witches would change the base <br />
nature of people so they COULD live in a utopia... Perhaps people do need to improve <br />
culture improves, or maybe it is culture that improves the people... but that is not <br />
something I will debate on.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Father Draco Fire merely sat in a corner writing down the vents of the trial. <br />
<br />
The faries blinked. <br />
<br />
Kathrine stared. <br />
<br />
Linus look scandalized.  &quot;OBJECTION!!! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CROSS EXAMINE MYSELF?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Azrael said, &quot;You may have Sister Kathrine direct the cross examine ones for you... the <br />
witness shall take the stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus did so... then lifted up his arms and let his sleeves fall down, revealing his arms <br />
ended at his wrists. He had been carrying the book when needed through the inside of his <br />
elbows. <br />
<br />
&quot;And how am I supposed to be sworn in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Azrael said without missing a beat, &quot;You will place your arm on the bible and swear in <br />
that manner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus slowly and reluctantly did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Linus Sure... &quot; Marie Cruz began, &quot;Your were tutored by a mage for years yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus said carefully, &quot;I was, though I do not practice magic itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are fully versed in magic and it's practical appreciation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am aware of it's fundamentals and what can and what not work if that is your question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you viable source for testimony on magic yes or no please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, by your previous statement, magic DOES have rules and limits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And to say it has limits is somewhat unfair, a man's body and mind has limits, but <br />
two men will not naturally accomplish the same things. But yes, while it follows a different <br />
path from the sciences, it does follow the base law of chaos and effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what makes it different from science then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is again a rather unfair question. A fish, a bird, and a wolf all have brains, bones, and <br />
eyes, but they are very different and wouldn't be considered the same normally if one <br />
asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they are all animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they are. But science, magic, and alchemy, are all means by which man is able to effect <br />
his environment, but that does not make them the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Azrael asked, &quot;Does the defense have a point to these questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am getting there your honor.&quot; She looked back at Linus, &quot;So magic like science does <br />
follow rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Different- but rules all the same yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what limits magic has are related to what resources, tools, and knowledge one has?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. So why is mana, or perhaps the source of mana, often called the infinite chaos <br />
if it follows rules?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It involves limiting the possibilities of the chaos until they become only one path the chaos <br />
can follow. But chaos is by it's nature resistant to this thus why precaution must be taken <br />
when learning how to control it. Thus why mediums and familiars are used when wielding <br />
magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So magic can not be used directly without a tool?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be used raw. Some of the most powerful mages in history were even able to create <br />
MENTAL MEDIUMS in their minds' eye to filter the chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But all the same there must be a medium of some sort? What side effects are most <br />
common?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes simply nothing happens. But if forced, the user risks losing touch with reality, <br />
and damaging their sense of logic as the chaos runs unchecked through their mind. Being <br />
unable to comprehend others do not think the same as yourself for example can occur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From the last journal entry read... would you say that occurred or likely occurred when the <br />
witches attempted to make everyone on Earth an immortal child?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's clear that their spell failed or backfires, what happen when a spell fails or backfires?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes the mana is wasted. Other times if used on a much grander scale, fate itself <br />
will try to backlash on everything the spell attempted to do. Other times it can backlash <br />
fully on the user.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And would you say that occurred here? in Glendale, with the witches' first attempt to <br />
remake the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot;</p>
