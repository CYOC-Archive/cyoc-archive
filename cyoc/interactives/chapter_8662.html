<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Boys, you ever seen a steer after it's been gelded?&quot; Even though Jeff felt utterly humiliated, he dreaded what might be about to happen next.  <br />
<br />
Then, with another wave of the Madames' hands, Jeff watched as his testicles disintegrated... leaving only his 6' penis behind. The crowd roared again. <br />
<br />
Then Stephen noted how much this skinny city boy remained way to puny, clean, prim and proper to adequetly fill his new role. Take his skinny build for instance, this boy will have years of hard labor ahead of him, so I think his body needs to be altered a bit...<br />
<br />
With a wave from the Madame, Jeff's 150 pound frame of piled on 25 pounds of tight muscle. <br />
<br />
Jeff watched as he began his modest bulking, with the first bit of excitement he had felt since his ordeal with the Madame and her son had begun. However his excitement as well as his good fortune was to be short lived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh that's better&quot; cited Stephan... &quot;but still too pretty and desireable.  Look at what perfect teeth he has.&quot; as he grabbed Jeff's jaw and forcefully opened his lips for all the crowd to see. The crowd booed.  With another wave from the Madame, Jeff felt his teeth move and rearrange as two of his front teeth fell from his mouth and on to the stage. When Stephan again grabbed Jeffs jaw to display his new crooked stained and gaping smile, the crowd cheered again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we're getting there,&quot; Stephen told the crowd &quot;but this boy still needs some work. This kid smells like he just walked out of a fancy Paris department store, what are you doing wearing that fancy cologne to a show like this anyway? How about we provide you with a new collection of scents?&quot;  Madame then stepped forward to sprinkle Jeff with four new scents which would follow Jeff with him now wherever he went. The first is &quot;Old Sweat, to provide the working man the strong body odor he required to keep the bugs away while toiling away on the farm.&quot; The second is &quot;Ripe Ass, for those days when you have that not so clean feeling.&quot;  The third is &quot;Scent of Dried Urine, for those busy days when you just can't break away from the pasture. And to top it all off how about a little cronic halitosis to go along with that new set of nasty choppers.&quot;  As the last vestages of Drakkar faded away into obscurity, Jeff began to notice his new smell... what was it... it was a combination of all four! Oh God! as Jeff looked down he noticed that he was now absoluetly filthy, a ring of sweat drenched dirt hung around his lower chest and both his finger and toe nails were caked with with grimy brown substance, Jeff could only imagine. &quot;The thing about your new cologne collection my boy, Stephan started, &quot;is that it will never need to be applied... you will forever smell in some way or another of a boy who is in the very least hygenicly challenged.&quot; Even after you try and shower and come clean... you will continue to reek... I hope you enjoiy your new colletion of body scents&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd was loving the show. They were cheering now as they never had before. Jeff was still hoping for a way out of the trap he had become entangled in, but he already knew he was a changed man. Or at least part man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now on to his clothing.&quot; Stephan told the crowd. As the Madame waved her magic hand once more, Jeff's pile of Abercrombie and Fitch clothes which still remained on the stage began to transform. When the change completed Jeff could only stare at the new pile in horror.<br />
Stephan then ordered him to put them on. Reluctantly but no longer in control, Jeff complied, first picking up a pair of worn hanes white briefs both stained by urine and feces, putting both his legs into them he pulled them up concealing his new gelded crotch, then Jeff picked up an old torn and sweat soaked flannel shirt which reeked of his new body odor. His new dirty socks came next right before his frayed and stained body hugging jean overalls. His outfit was then complted after slipping into his new pair of old muddy work boots. Jeff could only stand there glumly on the stage modelling his new form and wardrobe to a cheering crowd, as both The Madam, and Stephan grinned with satisfaction. &quot;Smile for the crowd you dirty oaf&quot; Stephen directed him, and Jeff was helpless to part his lips and display his new crooked toothless grin.    <br />
<br />
&quot;Now this unbeliever, still has to be taught a firm lesson as we prepare him for his new job as a farm hand,&quot; began the Madame... &quot;This pretty city boy came to my show well educated, self rightous and self indignant, yet he has behaved so ignorantly towards the powers I have shown to him, so let us fill him with the true ignorance he has rudely shown to us, knowing only what he will need to know get him through his daily life in the future, and erasing the needless knowlege he has already gained during his short life.&quot; A final wave passed over Jeff in those last fateful moments as he lost the well educated part of himself he had nurtured for 16 years and new more basic thoughts flooded into his brain.<br />
<br />
Stephan again addressed the crowd, &quot;Now this boy will alway remember who he used to be however with his new persona in place he will always be helpless to toil the days away as the new simpler boy we have created here before you. Isn't that right Jeffery?&quot; <br />
<br />
Deep inside Jeff was screaming in horror, Jeffery just gave a blank stare as he said &quot;A-yuh.&quot;</p>
