<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James plucked Jacob off of his feet as soon as he and Rick entered the dining room, kicking and laughing at the still-exhilarating feeling of being lifted and carried so easily. In this case, however, his flight was cut disappointingly short, as James immediately deposited his poofy bottom in a highchair...and then relieved him of his tiny Squirtle t-shirt. Jacob squeaked and instinctively wrapped his pudgy arms around his newly-shirtless little self, blushing as he peeked down to look at the chubby little toddler tummy he was trying to cover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t I haf my shiwt?&quot; He asked, struck by how much it sounded like he was pouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the rule, kiddo,&quot; James smiled as he repeated the process for Rick, who if anything seemed amused by the compulsory undressing. &quot;You guys are more than welcome to feed yourselves but there&#39;s no point in making a mess of your clothes while you&#39;re at it. Now dig in - there&#39;s ice cream waiting for little boys who clear their plate.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he plopped a little bowl of mac and cheese in front of each of the boys before sitting down to his own dinner - a freshly-grilled steak and a hearty potato. Though Jacob eyed the grown-up food covetously, he had to admit that his own meal looked pretty good - this was clearly homemade and it smelled amazing. Rick, for his part, had already dug in - and though his lips were already smeared orange from his clumsy forkwork, the little sounds of contentment he produced made it clear that the mac and cheese was every bit as delicious as it smelled. Jacob tentatively took the tiny, thick-handled plastic fork that had been provided to him, using every bit of his two-year-old dexterity to guide a bite to his lips...and just about keeled over with joy when the food hit his tongue. His taste buds felt as though they had been supercharged, every one of them lighting up when coated by the wonderfully savory sauce and perfectly cooked pasta. Reservations gone, he greedily dug into his meal, quickly making a mess of his lips and cheeks and occasionally dropping a cheesy elbow onto his soft round baby belly. But that was okay - it was great, even. It was what was expected of a pair of toddlers who wore nothing but their Pampers as they devoured their dinners.<br />
<br />
Soon there was nothing left in Rick and Jacob&#39;s bowls but a memory of orange, bowls that were quickly replaced by new dishes containing spoons and baby-sized portions of vanilla ice cream. If the mac and cheese was heaven then this was cloud nine, every spoonful of outrageous sweetness actually making Jacob shiver a little in pure pleasure. The dessert was soon similarly demolished, a layer of stickiness added to the cheeks and chin and chest and tummy already marked by the remnants of his dinner. The blissed-out little baby looked over to Rick to see him sucking his stubby fingers clean, which Jacob giggled at before immediately imitating. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; James grinned as he set the plates aside. &quot;It&#39;s bathtime for you messy little monkeys. Think you can do me the favor of doing your business before you get in the tub?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob looked puzzled until he turned to Rick, who responded to James&#39; request merely by giggling and closing his eyes. A moment later he let out a sigh of contentment that was punctuated by a now-familiar hiss, Jacob&#39;s eyes widening as he watched Rick flood his diaper for the second time today. James didn&#39;t want to waste two pairs of Pampers, Jacob realized, to say nothing of the benefit of getting us in the tub <i>after</i> we&#39;d done what he referred to as our business. That thought was a dim and distant one, however, as Jacob was entranced by the sight of Rick not only wetting himself but also taking great pleasure in doing so. Finally his eyes fluttered open, the toddler squishing about in his drenched diaper and beaming up at James when he was praised for being a good baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the holdup, kiddo?&quot; James chuckled as he turned to Jacob. &quot;With you I usually don&#39;t even have to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Um...&quot; Jacob blushed and played with his pudgy hands. Though he had done his business with gleeful abandon earlier in the day, the pressure to perform in this moment made him self-conscious. He hadn&#39;t been able to pee with someone watching as an adult, either. &quot;I don&#39; hafta go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; A sly grin came to James&#39; lips. &quot;So nothing will happen if I do...THIS?&quot;<br />
<br />
James punctuated the final word by sneaking his hands beneath Jacob&#39;s armpits and tickling them mercilessly, the baby squealing and squirming as the man&#39;s fingertips danced over his baby-smooth skin. He laughed his head off as Jacob teased his tummy and his thighs and the soles of his impossibly small feet, loving how helpless he was being made to feel. The toddler also loved what resulted from the tickling, loved the wet warmth that soaked into the front of his diaper and hugged his weenie so wonderfully. James mercifully let up once he saw the first yellow dot, instead stroking Jacob&#39;s soft hair as he allowed the baby to savor the feeling of the soak tickling its way between its legs and spreading over his chubby little bottom. A dreamy smile crept across Jacob&#39;s lips as he squirmed in the lovely squelch he had created for himself, a dreamy smile that turned into a naughty grin that he shared with Rick as he similarly enjoyed his saturated diaper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get used to those,&quot; James snickered as plucked the babies out of their highchairs and into his arms. Jacob and Rick giggled and played footsie with one another as they were carried to the bathroom, where their bare feet were set on a soft and fuzzy bathmat. With James temporarily distracted by getting the bath going, Jacob and Rick were left to their own devices for a moment - which Rick immediately capitalized on by grabbing the waistband of Jacob&#39;s diaper and pulling it up as high as he could, giving him a quasi-wedgie that squished the wettest parts of the soaked garment up against the areas that felt the most nice being squished. Jacob gasped in surprise and let out a little moan before his playful side took over, returning the favor for Rick and grinning in satisfaction when his baby boyfriend reacted the same way to the sudden stimulation. They stood like that for a moment - eyes locked, cheeks flushed, daring little smiles on their faces - before the moment was broken by James reaching over and pulling at the tabs of their diapers. They fell to the floor with a simultaneous squish as Jacob instinctively squeaked and covered himself, his blush only deepening when his modesty drew laughter from both James and Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, are you shy all of a sudden?&quot; James chuckled as he took Jacob by the underarms and plucked him off his feet, drawing another squeal out of the baby as the act swept his pudgy hands away and put his stubby little weenie out there for all to see. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get you into something more decent, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob started to protest but the words just melted away when his bottom hit the porcelain, when he started soaking in the warm, bubbly water that James had filled the tub with. Rick was put in a few seconds later, and after that came a bucketful of bath toys - squirters, pourers, and all manner of dinosaurs and action figures. In a day that had provided no shortage of unbelievable moments, this might&#39;ve been the most fantastic yet - it took him a moment to accept that he really was a naked little baby sitting in a tub with his similarly nude and similarly toddlerized friend, that there were toys and bubbles and that he was about to be bathed like the helpless little two-year-old he was. The biggest, brightest grin he&#39;d worn all day split his cheeks as he grabbed a plastic brontosaurus and started playing, the sounds of laughter and splashing filling the room as two happy little baby boys had their bath.</p>
