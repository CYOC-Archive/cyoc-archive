<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
You stood calmly for a few moments as you could feel your colony climbing up onto you. As you glanced back you noticed that the drones that first spoke to you after your transformation were moving toward the back of your abdomen. You could also see Hank beginning to move to a point behind you. Seeing him as a giant drone brought the dream you had seen several times. Sitting in a large underground chamber, your abdomen swollen larger then it is now, and ants half your present size carrying eggs out of the chamber. And while it was a sign that you were succumbing to an ant's instincts you could the hidden opening in your exoskeleton become wet again.<br />
<br />
The human part of your mind had some dissatisfaction at what was about to happen, but you also knew that you weren't going to be free if you didn't do it. Hank was trusting and extremely willing by the fact that he became your drone, but you seriously doubted that the rest of humanity would, and the interactions with Doctor Benjamin had proved that to you. You needed to lay eggs and start a colony of your own. It was the only way that you could think of where your freedom would be protected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your pheromones are arousing,&quot; Hank said to you as you then felt his antennae rub against the back of your abdomen.<br />
<br />
You became &quot;wetter&quot; at the touch. Your instincts desperately wanted to mate, but felt you needed to be in the air first. You also began to smell something arousing through your own antennae, and realized that Hank was not only aroused himself, but was also producing pheromones. You began to slowly beat your wings in response. You also moved to grip the bag that held Hanks equipment with one of your clawed feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're okay with acting like an ant?&quot; you asked Hank.<br />
<br />
&quot;To understand them better... yes,&quot; Hank replied.<br />
<br />
You looked back to see Hank's wings begin to beat as well. You could tell that &quot;it&quot; was coming. You wouldn't be able to hold it back much longer. And so you turned to comment to the normal sized ants that had transformed you and then Hank on your command.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm getting ready to take off,&quot; you said to them, &quot;please make sure you're not in a place where my wings will blow you off easily... and grip me firmly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my Queen!&quot; came the answer from the individual workers.<br />
<br />
You then turned to the drones, who were again drinking your aroused sexual fluids. Being that they were able to fit their heads into the opening and drink off of the much more sensitive &quot;flesh&quot; that was under your exoskeleton was doing more then enough to keep you aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys might want to move to a different part of me,&quot; you said to them, &quot;Hank's abdomen is going to join mine there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're sorry, my Queen, but you smell so good!&quot; one of the drones spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; you answered, &quot;and believe me, I'm beginning to wish you were all as big as Hank is and I could enjoy ALL of you... but you are not and I am too big for you to impregnate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, my Queen,&quot; a different drone answered, though you detected a bit of reluctant acceptance in his voice.<br />
<br />
You knew the colony loved you and you had accepted that you were beginning to love them back, and that was evident in all of that. The drones loved you especially, but there was no realistic way they could do that beyond show their devotion. You hoped laying a lot of eggs would make it up to them, and began to buzz your wings at full speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go!&quot; you announced as you felt your wings begin to lift you into the air, their pull coming from your thorax.<br />
<br />
The flight was somewhat chaotic as you found that the hinge in your thorax that allowed you to breathe deeply, despite your size, impeded your flight. Your wings buzzed furiously and provided plenty of lift, but because the wings moved with the expansion and contraction of your thorax, your control was somewhat limited. It made dodging tree branches somewhat difficult, but you managed. After a few more seconds, your flight became even more difficult, but was well welcomed. You felt Hank catch up to you and &quot;land&quot; on you. His six legs wrapped around your abdomen and gripped you tightly. You could still hear his wings buzzing behind him and you now found yourself trying to dodge branches while carrying a large passenger on your back that had his own wings and was trying to fly on his own at the same time.<br />
<br />
But the chaos was not a major concern, as instinctively, you knew what would come next, and then you felt it. Hank's abdomen curled down and made contact with your own and right at the spot where you were releasing the pheromones that betrayed your arousal. As you abdomen met his, you felt something enter your abdomen from Hank. It didn't feel like any sexual organ that a human would have, or any other vertebrate would have for that matter. Instinctively, you seemed to know the joining between you and Hank was like the links forged between ant queens and drones since ants first appeared, but something in the back of your mind also told you that Hank would always be there for you. You guessed that had to do with Hank had said about Divine Fire Ant drones not only surviving the mating process but surviving long enough to mate multiple times with the same queen.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the exact science behind it, it did feel good to you, and almost immediately you felt Hank tense up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh... my...&quot; Hank began, but could continue as you suddenly felt a strong pulse within your abdomen.<br />
<br />
At first you were nervous, as though something was wrong, but then you realized that what you felt was the movement of semen into your abdomen. Hank was beginning to fill you with what you would need to start your own colony... at least a colony that would be your daughters, not just a group of ants that had adopted you as their new queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Hank,&quot; you managed to say to him despite the rapturous feelings you had at mating and the daydream of having a large number of eggs and daughters to care for them and to care for you, &quot;I love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, my Queen,&quot; Hank replied.<br />
<br />
The mating, which was different from anything you experienced as a human, kept you preoccupied as the two of you continued. The result was that flying rapidly became impossible, and the longer you and Hank mated the lower and lower the both of you came the to ground and the slower your flight became. Eventually, you landed in a fairly thick patch of rainforest. You felt a couple of more pulses from Hank before the connection between the two of you ended and he slid off your abdomen, and instinctively you knew that for the moment he had done his job. Now, you needed at least a primitive nest before you began laying eggs.<br />
<br />

Future Chapters<br />
<br />
You and Hank begin constructing a nest near where the two of you landed<br />
<br />
Through your link with the colony, you see what the ants left behind to spy on Dr. Benjamin see<br />
<br />
Part of the colony is sent off to find food, and test to see what Divine Fire Ant venom does to invertebrates (among invertebrates, it actually enlarges them to the point where they are on the same scale as you are, but lack the mechanisms to breathe and die as a result)<br />
<br />
An unknown drone that is half your size appears as you and Hank begin to construct a nest and urges you to follow her</p>
