<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as their bliss from experiencing momma’s milk ended, both boys noticed that their diapers were starting to feel warm. They didn’t react to it as their warm diapers felt great to them, but then they felt wet around their crotch area. <br />
<br />
They then realized that they were wetting their diapers. Both had expressions of shock on their face as their mouths dropped and eyes widened. They then looked at each other and noticed that they looked a little bit younger too. <br />
<br />
Stacy smiled as both of her boys were wetting their diapers in front of her after a breastfeeding session and also seeing her breastmilk magic work to her advantage. Both boys regressed physically by anywhere between 6-8 months, which placed Jim around 18 months and Mike closer to 2 years old.<br />
Stacy was very happy to see them at the age that she wanted to start raising them. <br />
<br />
“Well boys, looks like y’all have some diapers to change.” She stated. Jim and Mike blushed and were at a loss of words. They hoped to still have their speech when they talked, but they were embarrassed as they didn’t want to start babbling. <br />
<br />
“Well, this is a first.” Said Jim, surprised at his ability to still speak. Mike picked up on this and talked as well, “Now you know how I’ve felt the past two days.”<br />
<br />
“Alright boys, let’s get you both changed and dressed up.” Stacy said as she picked them back up on her hip. She took them to the nursery to change each of them. As they walked down the hall, both Jim and Mike felt very comfortable being close to Stacy. They really were starting to see her as mom. <br />
<br />
Once they got to the nursery, Stacy set Jim down first to change him and placed Mike back in his crib, one that will be shared now by both boys. Once Jim was settled, he had his diaper opened, feeling the cool air touch his crotch area on his skin. His tiny penile stiffened after having the cool air in the house reach that part that was covered by his diaper. It felt really good and Stacy saw that, not giving a reaction to it as she was concerned with cleaning him up. <br />
<br />
After wiping him down, she moved to sprinkling baby powder on his skin in his sensitive area. Once Jim felt the powder, he immediately shivered, starting to feel some pleasure. Stacy noticed and reached in the drawer on the changing table, pulling out something to keep him at ease for what she was about to do next. <br />
<br />
Jim noticed her moving her hand towards him with something in it. He didn’t catch what it was in time until she placed her hand over his mouth and felt something enter it. His mouth started sucking whatever it was and he quickly put two and two together after tasting latex rubber. He was sucking a pacifier!<br />
<br />
He was horrified at first, almost tempted to spit it out, but once Stacy started to rub the baby powder around his crotch and around his tiny genitals and shaft, his outrage changed to pleasure and he started sucking harder on his pacifier, moaning through it softly as he sucked. His sucking sounds could be heard as he was rapidly sucking his pacifier while she finished rubbing powder into him. <br />
<br />
Once she finished, she taped up his clean diaper and picked him up to place in the crib, picking up Mike quickly afterwards before he got a good look at Jim with a pacifier in his mouth. Jim watched as Mike was taken to the changing table. <br />
<br />
Once Mike was settled down, she undid his diaper and proceeded to clean Mike as well. He caved in quicker than Jim and started moaning with pleasure as she wiped his crotch of all the urine mess. Once she was finished, she smirked at Mike and teased him, “enjoying this too much huh Mike?” She smiled down at him also and proceeded to get another pacifier out of the drawer. She bought a few earlier for Mike in case he needed them for naps. <br />
<br />
She found one and put it in Mike’s mouth. He started to suck immediately also. He wasn’t as horrified, but didn’t like the latex nipple in his mouth. His opinion quickly changed as he felt the baby powder sprinkled onto his genitals and picked up his sucking motions as he felt Stacy’s hands massage his sensitive parts too. Mike’s eyes started closing halfway and his pacifier bobbed up and down his lips. He was enjoying this, despite being embarrassed internally. <br />
<br />
Once Stacy was done, she taped Mike’s clean diaper on him and picked him up to place right next to Jim. She then took a step back and looked at both of her pacified boys in their crib. Both Mike and Jim didn’t look her in the eye and looked around at their surroundings. Neither of them took the pacifier out of their mouths as they felt comfort having something to suck on. In a way, they fully started embracing their new lives as babies. <br />
<br />
Stacy was smiling as she couldn’t believe how cute both Jim and Mike were in the crib wearing nothing but a diaper and sucking their pacifiers. “Well, how does it feel now to be momma’s new babies? You both are in your proper ages for babyhood!” She exclaimed. Both Jim and Mike bashfully looked at her and didn’t respond, not wanting the latex nipples to leave their mouths just yet. They were embarrassed at their first diaper change together, but they knew that it wouldn’t be their first either. <br />
<br />
Stacy giggled, “It’s ok boys, I know that you two were adults not that long ago and this is new for you, but think of the fun we will have together! Mommy will feed you milk, take you out in your new stroller, drive you around to fun areas in the neighborhood to play around. You both don’t have to worry about a thing! You both will grow up as brothers and do more fun things together!”<br />
<br />
Jim and Mike cringed at the thought of being forced to be ‘brothers’ even though they were not related. They looked at each other and realized that they were gonna grow up together again. They had some weird thoughts in their head about being in the same crib and eventually the same bed, considering that they were adults not too long ago. <br />
<br />
Stacy went to pick them back up and bounced them lightly on her hips, “Don’t worry about a thing boys, besides, mommy is gonna have her new baby soon and they will need their big brothers to help them figure out the baby life! I know you two are gonna be great for my baby!” She stated excitedly, causing Jim and Mike to both smile behind their pacifiers a little bit. Stacy was glad that they were relaxing into their new roles. <br />
<br />
“C’mon, let’s get you two into some clothes and we will go pick out some more baby clothes and toys for you two. Sounds fun?” Stacy asked. Both Mine and Jim nodded their heads yes, the rings around their pacifiers moving back and forth after they did so. Stacy giggled and brought them to the changing table to put clothes on them. <br />
<br />
A little while afterwards, Stacy walked them both out to her car.</p>
