<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jill wanted to try and respond on her phone, but rapidly cringed as a wave of pain hit her making her clinch her teeth and her fists. It was a fierce pain that came from her most sensitive places, which only marked the reason why she was in the hospital. She was in labor. They&#39;d kept her there as part of some fear that there was something about Teddy that had worn off on her, that she would give birth to a Baby Fur or that once the baby was born, she would turn into a Baby Fur after her exposure to them back east and that their magic was only delayed in taking affect because it wouldn&#39;t touch and hurt the life of an unborn infant or something like that.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d been in labor for hours now and she knew her time was getting close as her contractions were now getting much closer together. Feeling them distracted her from her worries about her brother, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean she liked having contractions. She was ready to have the baby and get it over with, and hopefully quickly. She gave a bit of a grunt after her latest contraction hit her and had also dropped her cellphone. The noise of her grunt and the clacking sound of plastic hitting the floor was enough to bring her husband, Tom out of his chair where he had been dozing slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jill... are you okay?&quot; Tom said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... just... a contraction...&quot; Jill said slowly as her hands moved to rest on her womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;How far apart are they now?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few minutes,&quot; Jill answered, &quot;I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill looked down at her womb for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure things will be fine,&quot; Tom assured her, &quot;all the ultrasounds show that the baby is normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill gave a weak smile, but it really wasn&#39;t the baby that she was worried about. It was herself and Teddy.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
While neither Teddy nor his friends could hear the surprised calls of a group of Baby Furs driving around in their little plastic car, they did see a few signs that there was some other response. Mari saw what looked like road blocks being set up, though they also looked they were being designed to protect Fee-necks&#39;s city hall and some of the residential areas from something, though she really didn&#39;t register what at the moment. She&#39;d promised to take Teddy to see his sister and help him be a good un-cal, and she&#39;d do that. She was one of the scientists and doctors from the base near Cee-air-uh Vi-est-tah and was thus fairly important. If she needed to, she figured she could explain any differences they had with the local authorities, though so far, no one had seemed to actually come forward to stop them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where would your sister be?&quot; Mari asked to Teddy who was in the backseat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... when the soldiers came to take me to your Fort How-Whu-Ha near Cee-air-uh Vi-est-tah they also had my sister admitted to the main hostipal in Fee-necks,&quot; Teddy answered, his mind still nervous about that demon girl they&#39;d seen earlier. He was glad his friends understood, but a real part of him wouldn&#39;t be at ease until he was sure that Jill was safe and sound and that her baby was in no danger. &quot;So... best to try there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Mari answered and noticed a sign that posted the directions to the hospital.<br />
<br />
While Baby Furs often wrote in a way that mixed pictures with words and the words often spelled how they sounded, that didn&#39;t mean that Baby Furs couldn&#39;t read at all. Mari read the sign and turned to get onto the exit, which hadn&#39;t been blocked and drove along, and since she never approached the roadblocks, she didn&#39;t know what they were for. They simply continued on their way. There were no more road blocks and they made their way toward the hospital. Once there, Teddy wanted to rush ahead and get to his sister as fast as he could. It was Jamie who got a hold of him before he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;The demon girl was bad and should be stopped,&quot; Jamie spoke, &quot;but the not-friends will still fear us as well. We should go in in a way shows we think and are in control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mari agreed, &quot;show that we&#39;re in control and can promise to pinkie swear not to try and change anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Teddy said weakly, but agreed that his friends were right there.<br />
<br />
They carefully and quietly made their way in and approached a long front desk. The attendant was a bit distracted by some paperwork at first and didn&#39;t notice them until Teddy spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m here to see Jill,&quot; Teddy spoke, using his sister&#39;s first name only.<br />
<br />
The attendant looked down over the counter to see the three Baby Furs who waived back. She gave a startled gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Mari the deer,&quot; Mari spoke, &quot;the head scientist at Fort How-Whu-Ha, my fiend would like to see his sister. We promise we won&#39;t touch anything we&#39;re not supposed to giggle, laugh, or try to turn anyone. We promise...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You promise?&quot; the attendant asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pinkie swear!&quot; the three Baby Furs declared together as they held up their hands with their pinkie fingers extended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; the attendant asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, you can&#39;t break a pinkie swear,&quot; Teddy explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re here to see Jill?&quot; the attendant asked, &quot;Jill who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister, she isn&#39;t a Baby Fur because she had a baby in her tummy,&quot; Teddy spoke, &quot;I agreed to let her come here so she wouldn&#39;t be afraid and to show I am a good un-cal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... but her last name is...?&quot; the attendant asked, while pressing a button for security.<br />
<br />
Teddy gave her Jill&#39;s married name. The attendant was heard by them to hum before she responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, she&#39;s presently being moved to the delivery room,&quot; the attendant spoke as two uniformed security men came from around a side door, &quot;our security will escort you...&quot;<br />
<br />
The three Baby Furs nodded and followed the security men into the hospital. They went through various halls and up an elevator, which would normally be a fun adventure for the three Baby Furs, but with Teddy&#39;s desire to be with his sister, they retained a rather steady focus. They eventually came to the hospital&#39;s delivery rooms as Jill&#39;s bed was being rolled to it so she could be transferred to it with Tom and the doctors following closely. When Jill gave a pained cry, Teddy responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jilly!&quot; Teddy gave a cry and moved forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teddy?!&quot; Jill gasped in surprise as the security men moved to block Teddy and Tom came around the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jilly are you okay? No one hurt you?&quot; Teddy asked as he tried to get around the security man&#39;s leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teddy... what are you doing here?&quot; Tom spoke as he glanced between his wife and her transformed brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being a good un-cal,&quot; Teddy spoke, &quot;show my sister I love her and her family with all my heart. Keep you safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
A part of Jill wanted to cry as she thought over things, though her present contractions were enough to keep her from saying anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... but what about curing you turning you back?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure Baby Furs can go back to being not furs,&quot; Mari spoke up, &quot;I tried some tests to find out things... and... well... all I figured out is that it would be better to be friends than not friends. If you don&#39;t want to be Baby Furs... we can be as quiet and as calm as we can... but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t love...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mari the deer, I am the head sy-ant-tist at Fort How-Whu-Ha,&quot; Mari answered, &quot;I was assigned to try and reverse Teddy&#39;s transformation... but I think it wouldn&#39;t work. This is our guard, Jamie the rabbit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie waived politely. Tom only looked back to Jill.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get her in for delivery,&quot; the doctor spoke as he looked over to Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please let me be there for my sister,&quot; Teddy said weakly to Tom as he finally got around the security men, &quot;I promise I&#39;ll be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... but best to stay quiet and out of the way,&quot; Tom said to Teddy and offered the Baby Fur his hand.<br />
<br />
And so they moved into the delivery room.</p>
