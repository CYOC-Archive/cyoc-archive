<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The air was cool, and I could feel a slight breeze brushing against my skin as I waited in front of the back door of the residence Ty had mentioned. It was already 10:15 PM, and a hint of worry began to creep in. Ty hadn’t responded to my messages for several minutes. My phone remained silent—no vibrations, no sign of life from her. I tried to reassure myself, thinking that maybe she was just busy ensuring no one noticed her as she came to let me in, but the wait was growing nervously long.<br />
<br />
I looked around, trying to stay calm, but my mind was already imagining the worst scenarios. What if someone had caught her on the way? What if she had changed her mind at the last minute? I lost myself in these thoughts, each passing minute stretching into an eternity.<br />
<br />
Then, finally, the door creaked open. Ty&#39;s face appeared in the darkness, and I felt a weight lift from my chest. Her shy and conspiratorial smile was there, and without saying a word, I stepped forward to kiss her. Her lips were soft, reassuring, and I let all my worries evaporate. We didn’t need to speak. Our actions were enough.<br />
<br />
She gestured with her hand and turned to guide me through the corridors of the residence. I followed her, careful not to make any noise. The hallways were dimly lit, illuminated only by a few scattered nightlights. The walls were a faded off-white, slightly yellowed by time, adorned with old photographs of past groups of students. The parquet floor creaked occasionally, each sound echoing louder than usual in the nighttime silence.<br />
<br />
We walked down a narrow corridor, then turned into another, wider one, where a series of closed doors lined up—probably the rooms of the other residents. I could hear the distant sound of a faucet running somewhere, but other than that, everything was quiet, almost oppressively so in this atmosphere of forced discretion.<br />
<br />
After what felt like an eternity, we arrived at the door of her room. Ty pulled out a small key from her pocket and carefully unlocked the door. We stepped inside, and I was surprised by the room’s size. It was a small dorm room, simple and functional, with bunk beds against the far wall. The bottom bed was covered with a soft blanket in pastel colors, while the top bunk appeared empty, perhaps waiting for the roommate who had not yet arrived. There was a small desk on the side, cluttered with books and open notebooks, a chair, and a wardrobe against the opposite wall. Nothing particularly remarkable, but the atmosphere was cozy, imbued with Ty&#39;s personality.<br />
<br />
As soon as the door was closed, we found ourselves in each other&#39;s arms. The wait, the anticipation, all of it had built a tension between us, and no words were exchanged before our lips met again in a passionate kiss. The outside world ceased to exist; there was only Ty and me, in this room hidden from prying eyes.<br />
<br />
I felt the warmth of her body against mine, her hands exploring my back, while mine caressed her hips. Our breaths grew quicker, more ragged as we drew closer, our bodies fitting together perfectly. The tension that had built up over the days was finally being released, sweeping us away in a wave of irresistible desire.<br />
<br />
Ty pulled me toward the bottom bunk, and we fell onto the blanket, our hands already working to free ourselves from our clothes. The movements were quick, almost desperate, as if we had been waiting for this moment for an eternity. My fingers slipped under her blouse, and I felt her skin shiver under my touch. She arched slightly, offering more of herself to me, and I took it as an invitation to go further.<br />
<br />
We continued undressing, piece by piece, until our bodies were bare, exposed to one another. I could see the spark of desire in her eyes, which only fueled my own inner fire.<br />
<br />
I positioned myself above her, gazing into her eyes to make sure she was ready. She nodded, her lips parted in a sigh of impatience. Slowly, I entered her, savoring every second of this shared moment. As soon as we connected, an unusual shiver ran through my body, like an electric shock.<br />
<br />
I paused, surprised by this sudden sensation, but Ty smiled and pulled me closer. I mentally brushed aside the growing unease, telling myself it was probably nothing—just the excitement of the moment. After all, a little shiver wasn’t going to stop me.<br />
<br />
I began to move within her, and Ty responded immediately, our movements naturally synchronized. Yet, as we continued, an unusual sensation settled in. My member, usually throbbing in moments like these, felt something different. The heat and pleasure were still there, but a strange hypersensitivity started to set in. It also seemed to be… shrinking, in a way that was hard to explain, as if it was losing volume. But oddly enough, the sensation of fullness persisted. Everything was confusing in my mind.<br />
<br />
Ty, completely absorbed in her own sensations, didn’t seem to notice at first. However, after a few minutes, she opened her eyes and murmured, her breath short, &quot;Tom… I feel like I’m not feeling you as much anymore…&quot;<br />
<br />
I remained silent, searching for what to say. My body felt stranger and stranger, but I pushed those thoughts aside, focusing on the pleasure we were sharing. &quot;Don’t worry, it must be… I don’t know, the fear of getting caught,&quot; I murmured, trying to convince myself as much as her.<br />
<br />
She nodded, seeming to accept the explanation, and intensified her movements, trying to recapture the initial sensations. But the more we continued, the more I felt my member diminishing, as if it was merging back into me. It was impossible, I thought, this isn’t real.<br />
<br />
As my member gradually disappeared, I instinctively moved closer to Ty, seeking to maintain the sensations, my pelvis pressing against hers to remain connected. When I no longer felt myself inside her, I began rubbing what was left of my sex against her clitoris. Overwhelmed by the sensations, I didn’t realize what I was doing; I was just trying to continue that intense pleasure.<br />
<br />
Ty then whispered to me, a mix of surprise and pleasure in her voice, &quot;Tom… I don’t feel you inside me anymore, but… I like what you’re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her whisper should have unsettled me, but instead, I let myself be completely carried away by a wave of new and powerful sensations. It was no longer the pleasure I knew as a man; it was different, deeper, more intense. At the same moment, Ty and I reached a peak of pleasure together, our bodies in perfect harmony despite the transformation that had just occurred.</p>
