<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soren sat at the table outside the office, the twenty-four year-old feeling odd being in the camp uniform again. He had worked at the camp for a few summers back in college, but it had been a while since then. Though he came here because Alex had reached out. He had retired after last summer, deciding working at the camp after 30 just wasn&#39;t in him. He wanted a younger critter with a love of the camp to take over after him and had tapped the bear. It was also the first time Soren was at the camp without Jack, but Jack&#39;s new job didn&#39;t let his get away for the summer like Soren&#39;s job at the high school.<br />
<br />
That was alright though, as soon as he went home Jack would be there waiting for him. They were married now afterall. It was still new, and Soren still found himself occasionally touching the ring on his finger with a smile. He sighed and looked at the clipboard in front of him. Alex had always made it looks so easy, but now that Soren was privy to the secrets of the camp he could understand why. &quot;Be gentle with me, old friend, it&#39;s my first time.&quot; There was a rustling in the leaves that made Soren relax, almost like the camp was trying to calm him.<br />
<br />
He was also waiting on some counselors to show. The camp didn&#39;t always have human guests, and other times it helped to have some counselors who weren&#39;t going through an identity crisis around. Those already settled in this world to help things move smoothly. Four of those names stood out on the list.<br />
<br />
Almost as if thinking of them summoned them, a car loaded with four older teenagers pulled into the parking lot. The group piling out of the car and heading into the camp, still joking. All had just graduated high school and were off to college the next year. Soren smiled as he saw them coming down the path.<br />
<br />
Jared was back to his old size. Not that Soren could really recall old human Jared, but he knew the tiger was about the same. Six four and a solid wall of muscle. He was almost as big as Soren. Almost. The bear had put on some muscle himself in the last few years.<br />
<br />
Walking at the buff tiger&#39;s side was a lean, athletic raccoon. The pair actually reminded him of Jack and himself. Jared had his arm around Ricky&#39;s shoulder as the two strode along. Rick, Soren corrected himself. He dropped the y as he got older, preferring just Rick now.<br />
<br />
Martin was the last of the original trio of boys Soren laid eyes on. He was lean like Rick, but taller. He carried a basketball under one arm as he chatted with the others. Both him and the fourth of the group were heavy into playing basketball through high school and if Soren remembered right were both playing for the college now. His other hand was entwined with that of the fourth member of the group.<br />
<br />
That would be Josh, almost Jared&#39;s height if you didn&#39;t count the antlers, which Josh always did. He had also put on a descent amount of muscle over the years, but not in comparison to the heavily muscled tiger. It was hard to remember that Josh had been such a little dick that one weekend all those years ago. He had let that go and joined in with the others with ease and now the four were almost inseparable. Soren was even surprised their relationships held on through the turmoil of high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach!&quot; Jared called as he spotted Soren. The bear grinned. He had also kept up with the four during his new job last year, teaching gym at their high school. &quot;What&#39;re you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Soren tapped his name tag that read head counselor. &quot;Alex decided to pass on the torch, I&#39;m taking over this year.&quot; All four were grinning. He knew they liked Alex, but Soren was closer to them so they no doubt were suddenly excited for the weekend. &quot;You guys are in 17 and 18.&quot; They would go to sleep tonight, maybe wondering why the camp seemed so empty only to wake up to a camp in full swing in the morning with no recollection that it had only been a few in place the night before. The camp never wanted too many people knowing clearly what was going on.<br />
<br />
Jared grabbed Soren in a bear hug before heading off to the cabins, the other three settled for hand shakes and slaps on the shoulder or back. Honestly, he was relieved to have those four around, even if he knew they were going to be a little preoccupied with each other once in a while. He and Jack were the same way and they still got their work done.<br />
<br />
Soren would have to go over to meet the human side of the camp soon. This is what made him truly nervous. It had been so long since he was human and he wasn&#39;t even sure what he&#39;d look like. Luckily it would only be for a few hours.</p>
