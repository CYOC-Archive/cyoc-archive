<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carson shook his head, feeling a little dazed. He hoped that Hendricks wouldn&#39;t care about the different soap. That flowery scent might be off-putting to some of the guys. Carson walked out of the locker room and back towards the field. He could see that the team was doing the end-of-practice stretches. That surprised Carson. How long had he actually been in the locker room? He ran up to the other assistants standing by Coach Morris.<br />
<br />
Noticing Carson&#39;s return, Morris asked, &quot;Did you get that soap thing taken care of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Coach,&quot; Carson replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does the new soap at least smell better than the shit the college gives us?&quot; asked Kasey, one of the other assistants without taking his eyes off of the team.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a little flowery though,&quot; answered Carson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything that makes the team not smell like a fucking landfill is a win in my book,&quot; Kasey replied.<br />
<br />
Carson chuckled while Hendricks blew his whistle one final time. The team huddled up around him on one knee. The coaches and assistants gathered a little closer to hear him as well. Carson glanced up and noticed that Coach Morris was still looking at him. In fact, it was more like Morris was staring at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Coach?&quot; Carson asked. Morris didn&#39;t respond. He just continued to stare. Normally that would weird Carson out. But Carson felt...comfortable? Or he felt proud? In any case, Morris&#39;s staring was making Carson feel good. &quot;Coach Morris? What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older, slightly overweight man blinked and bit his lip a little. He placed a hand on Carson&#39;s back and said, &quot;Richards, you and I...uh...need to talk...in...private.&quot; Instead of concern, Carson felt a tingle of pleasure radiate from Morris&#39;s hand to his slowly rising cock. Carson nodded, and the two quietly walked away from the team towards the indoor football field building separate from the gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally,&quot; Coach Hendricks announced to the team, &quot;we finally got some body wash for the showers.&quot; Murmurings of satisfaction and some cheers rippled through the group, save for one man who grew visibly worried. &quot;I don&#39;t want to see any of your sweaty and smelly asses leaving the parking lot without so much as a hose down. Get cleaned up, go home, and get some rest.&quot; Hendricks turned and walked away, signaling the end of the practice.<br />
<br />
Matt groaned and stared at the ground as he walked back to the locker room. Not only had he been struggling to keep these new gay feelings in check for all of practice, he had struggled with balancing out his ability to avoid tackles with his new desire to grab and be grabbed by all of these manly, beefy men around him. He had to take a breather and let the second-string quarterback, David, take the lead a few times. He had felt like his cock was going to explode each time he got tackled. It humiliated and thrilled him with pleasure every time he found himself beneath one, two, or even three men at a time. The desire to get on all fours and take their dicks was difficult to ignore.<br />
<br />
How could he be this horny all the time? There are gay male athletes who are definitely able to block it all out. Why couldn&#39;t he be like them? It didn&#39;t quite hit him that he had started thinking about himself as a gay man until he entered the locker room. And now he was going to have to shower with all of these hot, sweaty, muscular men around him? On one hand, he was horrified that he&#39;d have to be naked while being completely aroused and turned on by them. On the other hand, he was a little bit excited to see all of them naked. Sure, he had been naked around them and had seen them naked dozens of times before now. But he was straight back then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I am gay,&quot; Matt thought to himself as he nervously stripped out of his gear. He started thinking about anything. He started thinking about the girls he had had sex with. Sure enough, he felt his dick start to soften, just in time for his jockstrap to come off. Yep, he was definitely gay now if girls&#39; bodies were a turn-off for him. He took a deep breath and quickly walked to the showers. Unfortunately, he was not the first one there. He struggled to turn his eyes away before he could even think about staring and ogling and managed to find a shower head in a corner. He turned the water on and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, this new soap is the shit,&quot; Kyle said. Startled, Matt opened his eyes and realized his linebacker bud was right next to him. He tried very hard to focus only on what Kyle said. Soap. The new soap. It is good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Matt weakly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, man,&quot; Kyle enthused, rubbing the soap on his beefy pecs. &quot;He feels good on these puppies.&quot; He stopped rubbing and bounced his pecs teasingly at Matt. Matt clenched his jaw but made a show of rolling his eyes. He reached for some of the soap, too. He held up the little bit in the palm of his hand. He thought he could smell flowers.<br />
<br />
&quot;It definitely smells better than the last soap they gave us,&quot; Matt tried to make conversation, rubbing it on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Kyle snorted. &quot;That stuff smelled like actual shit.&quot; He moved his hands lower. He failed to notice Matt struggling with immense difficulty to look away from Kyle&#39;s hands. Matt pulled his eyes away and continued massaging the soap into his chest. His own hands moved down. He quickly rubbed the soap over his semi-hard cock, trying his best not to moan or think about anything sexy. He then rubbed his legs and started to rub his ass.<br />
<br />
The feeling of his own hands on his ass sent Matt back to full hardness within seconds. He couldn&#39;t help himself as he began to knead the cheeks, grabbing more soap as he did so. His strong hands felt really nice. His fingers could just easily slip in and...nope nope nope. Matt quickly withdrew his hands. He was not about to finger himself in front of his team. His face flushed red, and he hoped that nobody had seen what he almost did. He began breathing deeply and quickly while his heart raced. To distract himself, he rubbed more soap along his arms and around his abs and back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Kyle said a little softly. Matt&#39;s heart froze. Kyle had seen it. Oh fuck. He was going to make a scene or something. Matt nervously looked at Kyle. To his surprise, Kyle was staring at Matt&#39;s hands. Matt wanted to say something about it but realized that Kyle&#39;s face looked different. No, not different. But it looked nice. Like it was really nice to look at. It was almost sexy even. No, not almost. It <i>was</i> sexy. Kyle&#39;s face was very sexy. Everything about it was sexy. His eyes, his ears, his nose, his lips. His LIPS! God, Matt wanted to kiss those lips. He subconsciously rubbed his soapy hands over his face and lips, barely realizing he did so. Matt blinked and didn&#39;t want to look away from Kyle&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Kyle whispered. That seemed to snap them both out of whatever reverie the two of them were in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-?&quot; Matt mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, um, can you get my back?&quot; Kyle stumbled over his words, clearly nervous. His eyes looked up and down Matt&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Matt asked dumbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My back,&quot; Kyle repeated. &quot;Can you wash my back? I can&#39;t reach it.&quot; Without waiting for an answer, Kyle turned his back, and his ass, towards Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah.&quot; Matt reached for more soap and hesitated. He stared at this huge muscular back in front of him. His dick was throbbing now, but Matt was finding it difficult to care about that. He then started rubbing Kyle&#39;s large back with both hands. At first, he was solely focused on getting the soap appropriately covered. But then, he began to subconsciously massage Kyle&#39;s back muscles. His hands went up and down the broad back. He felt a strange thrill of being able to touch these firm, hard, virile muscles. As he rubbed, the more Matt wanted to start kissing Kyle&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that, uh, is that good?&quot; Matt nervously asked, not taking his hands off of Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kyle said, sounding like he was short on breath. The big man turned around to face Matt directly. There was Kyle&#39;s really sexy face again. The desire and pull to kiss those lips came back stronger than before. God, Kyle was so hot! They stood, staring at one another in silence. They let the water cascade down between them. When did the two of them start sharing a shower head? Kyle&#39;s lips were so close now. Matt kept alternating from staring at Kyle&#39;s gorgeous lips to Kyle&#39;s stunning brown eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn...around,&quot; Kyle said softly. Matt barely registered what was said. &quot;I&#39;ll do you...r back.&quot; When Matt didn&#39;t move, Kyle slowly placed his hands on Matt&#39;s shoulders and turned Matt around. His hands felt amazing. Matt&#39;s body was on fire. Kyle&#39;s large and meaty hands rubbed and massaged and caressed Matt&#39;s back. Was he using soap at all? Matt just simply stared at the wall, absorbing all of these feelings.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s hands suddenly stopped moving. Matt almost moaned in disappointment. Kyle&#39;s breath grew more audible and ragged. Suddenly, Kyle&#39;s face was right next to Matt&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt,&quot; he hissed. Pleasurable chills went up and down Matt&#39;s spine. &quot;Your ass is so sexy.&quot; Matt&#39;s heart leapt for joy and arousal. His dick throbbed insistently. He turned his head to look right into Kyle&#39;s eyes, which were wide and dilated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then fuck me, Kyle,&quot; he hissed back. &quot;Fuck me right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lust shined brightly out of Kyle&#39;s eyes. The next second later, Kyle&#39;s gorgeous, sexy lips were planted right on Matt&#39;s. Matt stuck his tongue into Kyle&#39;s mouth, wrestling with the other&#39;s tongue. Kyle grabbed Matt&#39;s chest from behind and pulled him close. Matt&#39;s broad back was against Kyle&#39;s beefy chest. Matt could feel Kyle&#39;s incredibly hard dick pushing against his ass cheek. Matt finally allowed himself to moan, which Kyle reciprocated.<br />
<br />
Matt broke the kiss and said to Kyle, &quot;Get your dick inside me. I want it. I need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to be inside you, too,&quot; Kyle mumbled. He leaned back a little, lined up his dick with Matt&#39;s asshole, and began to push inside. Remembering how the dildo felt, Matt braced his legs and began easing himself onto Kyle&#39;s dick. It felt a little larger than the dildo, but it felt at least a thousand times better. He felt Kyle&#39;s dick continue to push inside when finally the base of Kyle&#39;s crotch was against Matt&#39;s ass. Kyle groaned and slowly eased back out. He stopped just short of pulling out entirely before pushing back in.<br />
<br />
Matt placed his hands against the wall as Kyle began to pick up speed and develop a rhythm. He began pumping in and out of Matt with increasing vigor. Suddenly, he reached forward, grabbed Matt&#39;s dick, and began pumping it in time with his fucking. Matt began to moan louder and louder. Kyle&#39;s grunts grew gruffer and gruffer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Matt moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kyle grunted. &quot;You&#39;re so fucking sexy. Fuckin&#39; hot. Your ass, your dick, your face, your back. All of you is fucking hot.&quot; He kissed Matt&#39;s back, licking up the water on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it to me. So hot. Fuck yeah. Fuck me,&quot; Matt continued to moan. His body was on fire and could feel himself getting close. &quot;I&#39;m close. I&#39;m going to cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah. Me too. Do it. Do it in my hand. Bet your cum is as sexy as you. Fuck! I want to kiss and lick and suck you all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. I&#39;m cumming!&quot; Matt yelled out. His dick erupted in Kyle&#39;s hand. His ass clenched around Kyle&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; Kyle yelled out with him, unleashing inside Matt&#39;s ass. Matt leaned back against Kyle as they continued to orgasm against each other. Kyle nibbled, licked, and kissed Matt&#39;s neck and shoulder.<br />
<br />
They pressed their faces together as their breathing calmed. Matt could feel Kyle&#39;s heartbeat against his back. The two of them looked at each other. The desire to kiss Kyle was still pretty strong. Matt didn&#39;t resist. Neither did Kyle. The two of them kissed for a few seconds. Kyle looked down and chuckled. Matt looked down and saw Kyle&#39;s hand covered in Matt&#39;s cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, just as hot,&quot; Kyle mumbled. He kissed Matt on the cheek before slowly pulling out, using a little more soap to wash his hand in the process. Matt groaned a little and turned around to face Kyle. Every part of this man was beautiful and sexy to him. He wrapped his arms around Kyle&#39;s waist and kissed him again. Kyle returned it and held Matt&#39;s sides.<br />
<br />
As if coming out of a fog, Kyle&#39;s eyes refocused and he said...</p>
