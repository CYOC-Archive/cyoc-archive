<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/><i>Hey! I finally worked up the nerve to ask for feedback. Any comments can be posted here: /index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=6050</i></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Time to wake up, dear sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm...&quot; Ty stirred at the sweet voice, the scents of fox and sex once more filling her nostrils. However, this time the odour renewed her: reminding her of the happiness she&#39;d known since she submitted herself to Mistress Luma, her fears and trials distant and fading.<br />
<br />
She was safe and warm in Rhea&#39;s arms. One Kitsune tail enwrapped her legs, while the herm&#39;s penis still rested partly inside her, half-swollen knot just kissing her labia. Ty snuggled into her, nuzzling into her elder sister&#39;s shoulder as boob shifted against boob, grinding her tender folds against that knot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha-hmmm... Good morning, little sister,&quot; greeted Rhea, kissing her and nuzzling back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm... good morning, Rhea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better. Thank you...&quot; Ty paused to look into the threetails&#39; gentle golden eyes. &quot;Thank you so much. For talking, for laying with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my pleasure, dear,&quot; Rhea assured her, moving a hand to stroke her hair. &quot;I&#39;m glad I was able to help.&quot; They fell silent, cuddling. Rhea groomed Ty&#39;s head a bit, making the submissive vixen giggle and flick her ears. But after a few minutes Rhea pulled back a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we do have to get up, I fear. Like everyone, we have to earn our keep -- and you have much to do today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; Ty held on to her. She did look forward to what Mistress Luma would do to her, but she was not quite ready for this time with Rhea to end. &quot;How much time before Mistress wants me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say a little less than an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then...&quot; She put her hand down to Rhea&#39;s shaft, hard with morning wood. &quot;Please... fuck me again? I want... to be reminded of when Mistress claimed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhea laughed. &quot;I imagine Mistress will do that soon enough herself. But -- of course, my dear.&quot; Rhea rolled her over onto her belly, and moved smoothly stop her.<br />
<br />
They had a short and intense session. As Ty recalled from the orgy, Rhea could be quite the forceful lover, despite her motherly demeanour. She used her tails to hold Ty down and give herself leverage, freeing her hands to grope possessively over the submissive vixen&#39;s soft flesh. The bed creaked a bit as Rhea drove herself into Ty, who squirmed and moaned and yipped as once more the swollen bulbs popped in and out of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always remember who we belong to, slave,&quot; Rhea growled into her ear a second before thrusting home one last time. Ty&#39;s answer of &quot;Yes!&quot; melted into animal delight as the knot tied and they came together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like someone is having fun in there,&quot; said the bright voice of Vala outside the door. &quot;About time you girls woke up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be... out shortly,&quot; Rhea assured her, catching her breath. She murmured a spell, and to Ty&#39;s disappointment she felt Rhea&#39;s knot quickly deflate, allowing the elder concubine to pull free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, dearheart,&quot; she murmured, licking Ty&#39;s ears. &quot;But we don&#39;t want to keep Mistress waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Ty agreed.<br />
<br />
Rhea got off her and Ty followed, still not feeling satisfied. But as it turned out they did have some afterplay, for Rhea led her into the suite&#39;s bathroom and gave her a quick rinse in the shower, her touch as loving as it was deft. It was not quite enough for the amorous Ty, who honestly could have spent all day being fucked, but it was better than nothing.<br />
<br />
After, Rhea brought Ty in front of her own mirror to brush her down and help her into a robe -- as she reminded the junior Kitsune, they were not to show their intimate flesh to just anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we shall be leaving the upper hall to get your piercings done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Piercings?&quot; echoed Ty with a little trepidation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.&quot; Rhea touched the golden barbell in one of her own nipples. &quot;The foundation of your jewellery. And, perhaps, for magical enhancement. Alessia&#39;s nipple piercings, for instance, help with her milk production.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty shivered, wondering if that would be gifted to her. What would it be like to feel milk sucked out of her heavy breasts through her sensitive nipples? It sounded hot, but at the same time, getting <i>pierced</i> in that tender area...<br />
<br />
&quot;Will... will it hurt?&quot; she asked, looking down at her breasts as she cupped them. Rhea petted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only for a second, dearheart. With magic the healing is almost instantaneous. Afterwards you will bathe, and the bath will complete the process; it will be as if you&#39;ve always been pierced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded. She wondered what piercings she would receive; if she would have a say in it; if Rhea perhaps knew. She decided not to ask -- being a slave girl was still new to her. Mistress would know best how to enhance her beauty.<br />
<br />
<i>My beauty...</i> Once again she ran her hands over herself, her full breasts and smooth stomach. She imagined gold and gems adorning her white fur, and her tail began to wag against Rhea as the elder concubine brushed down her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It... really is amazing to be a vixen,&quot; she murmured, tracing gingerly around her labia and up the curve of her hips. Rhea laughed, and moved around with a softer brush to set Ty&#39;s front fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing like being female,&quot; Rhea agreed. &quot;But...&quot; She touched her sheath, drawing Ty&#39;s eyes down. &quot;What if you could be both?&quot;<br />
<br />
The junior Kitsune pondered it as best she could while the soft brush teased her. &quot;I... don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you truly not remember what it was like, being male?&quot; Rhea lifted up a light robe of sea green cotton trimmed in dark blue.<br />
<br />
Ty shook her head. &quot;No. I can&#39;t remember having a... cock, only taking them.&quot; She smiled shyly at Rhea, and lifted her arms. &quot;Yours, and Mistress&#39;. I think... mmm...&quot; She snugged the robe around herself as Rhea slid it onto her shoulders. &quot;I think I like it better this way. Having a dick of my own would only distract me from what&#39;s important.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was answered by a musical chuckle. Rhea&#39;s breasts pressed into Ty&#39;s back as the older vixen reached around to tie a silk cord around her waist. &quot;I find it an exquisite addition, even when I&#39;m being dominated. To be massaged from the inside, and empty my slave seed on the air while Mistress fills me with real potency... ah.&quot; She sighed happily, and Ty could feel the tip of the discussed organ poking at the base of her tail. &quot;Still, we all have our own preferences.&quot;<br />
<br />
She finished cinching the cord, and took a moment to join her little sister in admiring Ty&#39;s reflection. &quot;Lovely, dear. Now come.&quot; Taking her hand, she guided Ty out into the hallway. A familiar orange vixen awaited them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Vala,&quot; said Ty, blushing a little as she remembered yesterday&#39;s encounters with the vivacious concubine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey cutie!&quot; Vala greeted, tail wagging. She dipped her head to Rhea. &quot;Morning, big sis! I saved you a bit of breakfast. Ham omelette sandwiches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, thank you Vala,&quot; replied Rhea, petting her head as she joined them in walking down the hallway. &quot;We&#39;ll eat them on the way down.&quot; Ty giggled as Vala purred. It still felt surreal to be so soft and sexy, part of a harem of pampered vixens, but now in a good way.<br />
<br />
They paused briefly outside Rhea&#39;s room, as the senior concubine ducked in to get her own robe. She came out again, her body covered in black linen; a length of pale yellow silk around her waist, tied in a bow above her tail.<br />
<br />
The sound of flute music wafted out of the dining room as they approached. Ty was once again taken by surprise to find it was Steph playing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you could play the flute now too,&quot; she commented, smiling at the almost-naked tiefling. Steph lowered the instrument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. I have proficiency in Fiddle too.&quot; She stuck her tongue out. &quot;And good morning to you too, Miss Tyana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty giggled. &quot;Morning Steph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Bonjour,</i>&quot; greeted Marie, emerging from the kitchen, carrying napkins wrapped around what looked like burritos -- the &quot;sandwiches&quot; Vala had mentioned. She offered one each to Ty and Rhea. She was dressed in a full maid outfit now, barely sexualised, and she curtseyed, ears down in submission, as Rhea thanked her. &quot;<i>Je t&#39;en prie, ma soeur.* La Maîtresse</i> asked me to oversee the cleaning of the lower hall today, so I am accompanying you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
(*&quot;You&#39;re welcome, my sister&quot; -- familiar and slightly formal.)<br />
<br />
&quot;So Vala told me you were getting pierced today...&quot; Steph looked from Ty to Rhea. &quot;Will I get piercings too?&quot; She touched the lobe of a pointed ear. &quot;The piercings I had from Earth disappeared when I entered the Five Lands, and...&quot; Her gaze drifted down to the gold studs around Rhea&#39;s nipples, and the thin golden hoops hanging from Vala&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Rhea laughed. &quot;I imagine Mistress Luma will adorn you prettily in time, dear. And if she tarries, you can always request it. I think gold would look lovely on your red breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Together the four walked out into the common room, where the other two vixens were lounging. Sardonica was reading a book, while Alessia daydreamed on a divan, hand on her belly. Both looked up, bidding Ty and Rhea a good morning. Vala joined Sardonica on her cushions, kissing her and stroking at her labia in promise of some morning lovemaking, while Steph took up a place in the corner. They all wished Ty good luck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t wait to see how you look!&quot; added Vala, tail wagging furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Ty, blushing as the two vixens went back to kissing. The sound of the flute covered the soft sounds as the doors opened, the harem guards greeted them, and the doors closed again behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, Marie?&quot; Ty asked in between delicate nibbles on her breakfast burrito. Despite her best efforts, she found crumbs getting on her robe as they walked back the way Ty and Mistress had come the evening before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, <i>ma soeur?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I&#39;m not... being rude, but... it&#39;s kind of odd that you&#39;re a maid, when we&#39;re supposed to be the top... slaves.&quot; <i>Man, that sounded awkward.</i> It was going to take time to get used to the idea that there was a hierarchy among them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I am not offended,&quot; Marie assured her with a shy smile. &quot;It happened that Mistress felt my pride needed special treatment, and sent me to the bandit Master to become <i>la soubrette Française</i>; she did not specify a race. When I returned a Kitsune, she was so taken with me that she made me a concubine. But, I still have my talents as a <i>domestique</i> -- since I am also a concubine, that makes me head of the cleaning staff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Ty made a note to ask for her full story later as they cut through the throne room. It was empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the piercing parlor,&quot; answered Rhea. Amused, she asked, &quot;You did not think she spent all her time here? The Pleasure Palace is both grand brothel and noble estate; she has much to do in overseeing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Ty was secretly disappointed, since she wanted to see the Mistress&#39; glorious body again as soon as possible. And it really had not occurred to her that one so divine would have to work as well; but it made sense. Mistress undoubtedly enjoyed overseeing the Palace.<br />
<br />
They reached the teleporter chambers just as Ty and Rhea were finishing their breakfast. Ty apologised for getting crumbs on her robe and in her fur, but Rhea laughed it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;The robe is just for modesty, not appearance; and remember you have a long bath ahead of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie held the door open for them, Ty noting that it was a different room than the one that Ancalion had brought her and Steph through yesterday. She heaved a sigh as she glanced at the stained glass fox before heading into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, little sister?&quot; inquired Rhea, putting a hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no... just remembering... It was just yesterday afternoon when I came through here, free.&quot; She touched her collar, feeling over the magical gems. The warmth of belonging rushed through her. &quot;It seems... so long ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lifetime ago,&quot; said Marie, following them and closing the door. &quot;<i>Vraiment.</i>* Once we accept the collar, it <i>is</i> the start of a new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
(*Truly)<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, and the three stepped into the slowly spinning star. When the white light cleared, they were in another room, somewhat plainer, with light grey walls.<br />
<br />
&quot;The third floor of the lower hall,&quot; commented Rhea as they stepped out of the teleporter. &quot;Used for general facilities, and amenities for the lesser slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded. &quot;My task is on the lower floors, so I bid you <i>adieu.</i>&quot; She nuzzled into Ty&#39;s cheek fluff, giving her a quick kiss. &quot;<i>Bon courage,</i> sister. I too look forward to your adornments -- I am a little jealous; my <i>rôle</i> does not allow for much ornament.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you could ask Mistress to change your role?&quot; asked Ty. Marie shook her head with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Je suis une femme de chambre</i>* -- a maid is what I am, what I was made to be; I wish for nothing else.&quot;<br />
<br />
(*I am a chambermaid.)<br />
<br />
Ty felt herself getting wet, remembering vaguely that Mistress had said the vixen had once been a spoiled boy. What a change. &quot;You <i>have</i> to tell me your full story one day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In due time,&quot; laughed Rhea. &quot;Mistress awaits. Have a good day, Marie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Merci, ma soeur.</i>&quot; She curtsied. &quot;You as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
They parted ways, Marie going down the hallway in one direction while Rhea led Ty in the other. The new vixen&#39;s heart sped up a little as she sighted the end of the corridor -- another pair of double doors gilded with Luma&#39;s lamp-in-heart, flanked by more stained-glass windows. Rhea put her hand back on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
A female Orc guard lounged in the corner by the door, halberd propped against the wall as she read a book. Looking up, she straightened and bowed to the concubines as they approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good day, revered sisters,&quot; she greeted. &quot;Heard the news?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t had time, little sister,&quot; responded Rhea, curious. &quot;Is it important? We have an appointment to keep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Nah,&quot; the Orc shook her head. &quot;Just some intruders got caught.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhea shook her head. &quot;Some people never learn... there are easier ways to become a slave. I&#39;ll ask Mistress about it while the new concubine here has her piercings done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; The Orc smiled at Ty, who couldn&#39;t help but think of Steph&#39;s old form. &quot;Good luck, revered sister, and congratulations for being chosen for the harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-thank you...&quot; Even though she had accepted it, it still seemed strange to be <i>congratulated</i> for being made a slave. But, as she fingered her collar, it made sense to her. What greater fortune could there be, than serving Mistress Luma&#39;s pleasure so directly? The rush of warmth from the collar, and the heady memories of Luma&#39;s sex, momentarily drove her fear of the upcoming opration from her.<br />
<br />
The Orc opened the doors for them, and they stepped through into a spacious indoor garden and swimming pool. A few lesser whores lounged in the water, or on benches, brass and bronze medalions gleaming at their throats. <i>Faux</i> sunlight from large enchanted crystals set in the ceiling reflected off the rippling water.<br />
<br />
But Ty did not have long to admire the wonder, or to study the few other slaves relaxing around them. Rhea kept them going at a fast pace, even as she returned a few greetings from the other women. The walls were lined with what looked like shop fronts, adding to the illusion of being outdoors; and it was towards one in particular that Rhea steered her charge. Another pair of double doors, red and gold; flanked by frosted windows, and over them a gilt-lettered sign declaring it &quot;Piercing Parlor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s nerves came back in force, but Rhea squeezed her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be fine, dearheart,&quot; the elder concubine reassured her. &quot;Think of how beautiful you&#39;ll look. How pleased the Mistress will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, drawing a deep breath. If her sisters had done it, so could she. And Mistreess... She gently rubbed a hardening nipple through her robe, imagining Mistress&#39; approval. She could do <i>anything</i> for her. And, as she neared the Parlor, she could sense the Mistress&#39; presence, flaring in lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock, dearheart,&quot; Rhea instructed as they stopped at the doors. &quot;Let them know we&#39;re here.&quot;</p>
