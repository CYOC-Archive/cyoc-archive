<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Cameron decided to just flush the rest of the beer down the toilet. He glanced down at his beginner beer belly. It was pretty firm and it didn&#39;t sag over the waistband of his shorts. He couldn&#39;t walk around with a beer belly, he was way too young! Cameron would just have to exercise hard to get rid of it.<br />
        A week later, he found himself standing in front of his mirror, inspecting his body. It seemed like all the exercise he had done over the past week had been in vain. His belly had not gotten smaller, in fact, it had gotten much bigger. It hung over the waistband of his shorts and it jiggled with Cameron&#39;s every movement. <br />
        But his belly was not the only thing that was different. Cameron noticed that he had grown quite a lot of body hair. The hairs around his navel had grown into a proper happy trail leading to his groin. The hair didn&#39;t stop there though. They continued upwards and spread in a thick patch in the centre of Cameron&#39;s chest. Speaking of his chest, it had also changed. It used to be pretty flat with almost no muscle, but now his chest had swelled up into muscular pecs albeit with a thick layer of fat that made his pecs look more like man breasts. Cameron lifted his arms. He noticed that there was a thick smattering of hair in each of his puts accompanied by a strong BO. Cameron reckoned that his BO was now stronger than those of the two jocks who had forced him to drink that beer. He groaned in despair and was shocked at his deeper, manlier voice. What was he going to do? He had become a fat, hairy and smelly ex jock in his twenties. <br />
        Cameron knew that he had to do something to reverse the changes. Suddenly, an idea struck him. He would go to Simon&#39;s house and demand that he change him back. After all, Simon lived only a few houses away from Cameron. <br />
        He quickly went to his wardrobe to find something decent to wear, feeling his flabby body wobble with every step. All his clothes had been changed too. All Cameron owned now were tank tops, shorts and boxers. He had no choice but to wear those items. Cameron soon found out that he was too fat for his boxers, so he decided to go commando instead. He had a hard time putting on his shorts due to the size of his considerable thighs and butt. Eventually, he got them on. Next, he put on his tank top. It was also too small and rode up on his hairy belly, exposing the bottom of his fat, rounded stomach. There was also a thatch of chest hair sticking out at the top of his singlet. He also saw tufts of thick black hair spilling out from the sides of his arms. Cameron knew that from this moment on, he would never be able to hide his hairy pits. Now that he was somewhat dressed, Cameron lumbered out of his house. <br />
        Even though Simon&#39;s house was only about a hundred metres away, Cameron was exhausted before he was even halfway there. He was so shocked at his lack of fitness. He had never been a very athletic guy but he had still been moderately fit before all this had happened. And now, look at him, panting and grunting from waddling a few metres! Cameron truly had the body of a jock who had let himself go. <br />
        Finally, Cameron reached the front door of Simon&#39;s house. He rang the doorbell. A minute later, Simon opened the door with a sated and stupid grin on his face. Simon must have just jerked off before answering the door. He was wearing nothing but a jockstrap that was way too small for his cock. Cameron could see his dick and some pubic hair spilling out from the jockstrap. Simon&#39;s hairy, muscular body was on display. Cameron could feel himself getting aroused at this for some weird reason. <br />
        &quot;Wassup Cameron, I&#39;ve been waiting for you to come,&quot; said Simon. <br />
       &quot;You have to change me back! Please!&quot; Cameron cried out. <br />
        &quot;Sorry bro, no can do. I can&#39;t reverse the changes.&quot; Simon said as he scratched his armpit lazily, his impressive thatch of pit hair out on display. &quot;But why don&#39;t you come in, I have something to show you.&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
        Cameron hesitated, should he go in or not?</h3>
