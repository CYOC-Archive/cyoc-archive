<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leaving the Skulk ceremony after having a wonderful time and meeting so many potential new friends, William and Martha Anderson hopped in their car, with their oldest son Nate and his boyfriend Alex Ramsey in the back seat for the trip home.<br />
Meanwhile, Melissa Stovall followed in her vehicle, with her daughter Julie and boyfriend Eric Anderson sitting in the back seat, chatting away as if they hadn&#39;t seen each other in decades and needed to catch up on absolutely everything.<br />
Julie was explaining all the ins and outs of being a were-mer and Eric was asking questions just about at the end of every sentence.<br />
<i>He&#39;s certainly inquisitive,</i> thought Mrs. Stovall. The occasional glimpse she got at the back of the Anderson&#39;s car revealed Nate and Alex chatting away too, although their conversation didn&#39;t appear as animated as the one in her auto.<br />
Soon they arrived at their destination, with Melissa pulling into the driveway behind William because Alex&#39;s car was still parked at the curb.<br />
As everyone got out, Martha couldn&#39;t help noticing that Eric held the door opened for Julie, and the young couple held hands on the way to the front door. She wasn&#39;t sure what the proper etiquette was for two guys dating concerning doors, but Mrs. Anderson did note that Alex and Nate walked side by side until the front door forced them to enter single file.<br />
In the living room, Eric and Nate excused themselves to run upstairs to their bedrooms to pack their overnight bags for their extended weekend with their respective partners; leaving their parents with Melissa and Julie Stovall along with Alex downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this has certainly been a day of revelations and surprises,&quot; observed William Anderson, trying to make conversation.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; agreed Alex. &quot;Me and Nate checking out Moon Lake College and perspective careers...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Melissa. &quot;I went to university back in California. How does MLC look?&quot;<br />
&quot;Quite promising,&quot; revealed Alex. &quot;I&#39;m gonna be a chef with probably a minor in business, and if Nate sticks with the career counselor&#39;s suggestions, he&#39;ll be a teacher while hoping to develop a second career as a writer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Julie, interested. &quot;Considering how many of them I read, I&#39;ve always thought about writing my own fantasy novels, but I&#39;m also too interested in doing something scientific to help protect the oceans to make that a full time job. Never really thought of it as a sideline before now...&quot; she added, her voice trailing off, lost in thought.<br />
&quot;Well, Nate will probably be turning his knowledge, obsession, and first hand experience with werewolves into some kind of prose venture before long, if he sticks to the plans he&#39;s been telling me about,&quot; said Alex. &quot;But it will be a long time before he ever gets published, let alone has a chance to become a household name, hence the teaching career as his major.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. Good idea,&quot; conceded Julie. &quot;Science first, words second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s interesting hearing the two of you talk,&quot; commented Martha, who was leaning against her husband while holding hands with him. &quot;We just moved to Moon Lake a couple of months ago and except for Nate, originally freaked out at the concept of weres. Now not only are all of us proud members of were society, but our sons have found true love amongst their fellows, and you two are chatting away as if you&#39;ve always been close in-laws instead of recently met friends.&quot;<br />
&quot;Moon Lake IS a rather special place,&quot; agreed Melissa Stovall. &quot;I&#39;ve heard many theories as to why, but I think it always comes down to the people. After all, this is where I first met Martin, and eventually realized my love and future were here,&quot; she added, before hugging her daughter.<br />
&quot;While we&#39;re alone, I&#39;ll be honest with you and admit that in the past I&#39;ve turned a couple of other young gay teenagers into werewolves at their request,&quot; revealed Alex, &quot;but Nate&#39;s special. Love might of snuck up on me when I wasn&#39;t looking, but now that it&#39;s here, I can&#39;t picture myself with anyone else but your son. When the time comes, I&#39;m still not sure who will take whose name, but Nate&#39;s the one I want to spend the rest of my life with, with your blessing of course Mister and Mrs. Anderson.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait until after you&#39;ve graduated high school, and you have our blessings, provided you two go on and get your college degrees afterward to start your careers,&quot; said Mrs. Anderson.<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s William and Martha, Alex. Remember?&quot; asked Mister Anderson, holding out his hand, which Alex shook.<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you two hyphenate?&quot; suggested Julie.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; asked Alex, looking at her.<br />
&quot;You become Alex Ramsey-Anderson, and he becomes Nate Anderson-Ramsey,&quot; she explained.<br />
&quot;You know, that might work,&quot; realized Alex, as a smile played across his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for me and Eric,&quot; began Julie, turning to face his parents, &quot;words cannot begin to describe how I feel about your son, William, Martha,&quot; she added, knowing they were already happy with her as a potential future member of their family. &quot;I love and care about Eric deeply, and I know he feels the same way about me,&quot; said Julie, fingering the single pearl necklace around her neck, secured in the knowledge of what it meant, even if the others around her didn&#39;t.*<br />
&quot;Today was <b>very</b> special for me and Eric**, and I can&#39;t help feeling the rest of our lives will be too, but rest assured we will keep <i>every</i> promise you asked us to make, as well as every promise we ever make to each other too,&quot; swore Julie.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all we can ever ask and hope for,&quot; said Martha, as she bent down and hugged her future daughter-in-law.<br />
The group shared a little more idle chit-chat before Nate and Eric came back downstairs, the older son slightly ahead of his younger brother. Eric was still in his evening clothes, while Nate had changed into more casual attire: jeans and a t-shirt with sneakers and a light jacket. Before departing, Nate would reveal that he was just about packed for the weekend that morning, while Eric still had to grab his things since he never suspected how today would turn out when he left that morning.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re ready to go,&quot; said Nate, as each Anderson child returned to be by the side of their respective beaus.<br />
&quot;My babies. They grow up so fast,&quot; said Martha, trying to keep from crying.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; agreed Melissa Stovall, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand.<br />
&quot;Okay you two. Behave, keep in touch, and we&#39;ll expect you back by curfew Sunday night because Monday&#39;s a school day,&quot; said William.<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; said Nate and Eric, practically in unison.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll keep Nate in line,&quot; said Alex.<br />
William simply nodded his head as Melissa Stovall said, &quot;I doubt these two have anything elaborate planned, but I&#39;ll keep in touch. By the way, we should plan on a family dinner soon, especially since Martin hasn&#39;t heard about recent developments yet,&quot; she suggested, while looking at Eric and Julie holding hands again.<br />
&quot;Good idea. Next week maybe? Before the Harper-Jenkins wedding?&quot; suggested William in return.<br />
&quot;Sure. He should be back from checking on his mother by Monday. Sometime mid-week?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha insisted on hugging the four teenagers before they all left.<br />
After standing on the front porch to make sure everyone departed safely, William and Martha went back inside their house.<br />
As he locked the front door, William turned to his wife and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. They&#39;re all happy, in love, and in good hands.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not worried. These are tears of joy,&quot; replied Martha, doing her best to wipe her eyes.<br />
&quot;Good. Now that we&#39;re alone, why don&#39;t I take you upstairs and show you how sexy I think you are in that tight blue dress?&quot; suggested William, as he hugged Martha while starting to nuzzle her neck.<br />
&quot;Why wait? Take me right here, right now,&quot; replied Martha, kissing her husband as she started transforming into her werecat fursona, making the dress even tighter as she began purring.<br />
&quot;With pleasure my love,&quot; said William, even as he felt his werefox fur begin to spread across his entire body as the couple rapidly began to undress each other.<br />
<br />

*While Martha Anderson made the necklace for Eric under the belief it would be a &quot;promise ring&quot;, were-mermen give their beloved were-mermaids single pearl necklaces as their idea of engagement rings.<br />
**Eric and Julie consummated their relationship by giving each other their virginity, while Eric joined were-mer society in the process.—tmw.</p>
