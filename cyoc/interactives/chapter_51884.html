<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In her dreamscape as she rested in Glendale's police station, the others too tired to bother her, Amy found herself before the mirror image of herself... Ami. The soul she'd been reincarnated from.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've done well Amy,&quot; Ami spoke politely, &quot;The destiny we had to face has come and gone. Good has prevailed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it really, Ami?&quot; Amy asked back, &quot;I mean the pack had effects on each other that the curse had no expectation of. Made Jensen and Kaylee and through them the rest of the pack more benign. Does that mean that maybe Glass could have made Kurse more benign?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What made the pack become more and more benign was the fact that they were all good people at heart,&quot; Ami spoke, &quot;they all had their faults... but ultimately they were good people. But Kurse... Kurse was different. She lost all concepts of love the instant she believed that anyone without magic was merely a machine to serve her ambitions and created the infamous &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; scenario between them and society... and then began to attack society because &quot;society&quot; was the enemy... it was the same with the people who ruled Japan during the war. They saw any &quot;other&quot; as subhuman and worthy of conquest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;but couldn't the witches have had good intentions to begin with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions,&quot; Ami retorted, &quot;was driving children mad under the pretext of &quot;liberating&quot; them from laws the right thing to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy firmly shook her head, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The world needs order, Amy,&quot; Ami explained, &quot;and the world needs chaos. They are two sides that mutually improve the world. The witches in their actions embraced chaos and decided to do away with order... and that is why Big Bad Island became so dark under their influence... if there was any hint of goodness in them... much of what the Pack and the Pride encountered there would not have happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still sense so much pain, Ami, so much suffering,&quot; Amy told Ami, &quot;it's so wrong... and there has to have been something we could have done to prevent it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but we have passed that point,&quot; Ami responded, &quot;and as for the suffering you feel, there isn't much I or you can do for them... the twin souls within members of our pack are not supposed to exist, and neither are the four souls within Fox and Elise of the Pride... as they are all creations of Kurse's magics, but the beings they resided in were real... were supposed to exist. If they didn't revert back to the physical forms they had before Kurse decided making them younger and twins was a good idea... they would have ALL died as the souls weren't real. By merging them back together those souls may survive alongside the original soul...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So there's actually three souls in some of our pack mates?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only in those who renamed one of their twin selves,&quot; Ami answered, &quot;and even there... that is hard to define. Robyn's soul is Robyn... but it is made up of Roxy and Brylee... who as I said should not exist at all... but I could not let anyone die. I have experienced it, and it is not pleasant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is their anyway to fix the problem?&quot; Amy asked, &quot;Let Robyn's soul regain control of Robyn and let Roxy and Brylee exist on their own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger would need to impregnate Robyn with twins before that would happen,&quot; Ami answered, &quot;though that is a likely outcome... given Kaylee's past pregnancies... I would say it is common for Big Bad Wolves to have twins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Zelipe is not our twin, he is our half brother,&quot; Amy pointed out, &quot;and Alice, Abbey, and Samantha are not twins or triplets... they are identical because of their mothers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but but remember that we as Randy were married to Zelda,&quot; Ami spoke, &quot;and we were reborn to a larger family then we had before. So, June and Pearl shared us as we were reborn. We became June's daughter and Zelda became Pearl's son. Alice, Abbey, and Samantha were reborn much the same way. Kaylee is the only one who when she and Jensen remade their parents is the only one who did not need to share her &quot;children&quot; with others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it is natural for us to bear twins?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami nodded, &quot;and that might be the only way to let the Gem wolves' internal twins to live... the other obvious way would be to physically merge their souls... but we are not strong enough for that... and since it was created by Kurse... ONLY one of Kurse's creations could do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Glass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She might be able,&quot; Ami commented, &quot;I do sense Kurse's power within her, and yet neither do I sense Kurse's evil... perhaps she is the one who will become the benign force to cure the evils that Kurse has done to our pack or the Hardy's pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we be able to do something?&quot; Amy asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help,&quot; Ami answered, &quot;but our destiny, Amy, was to stop Kurse, which is what we did... fixing the Pyrrhic nature of our victory to set things right and set the balance between order and chaos is Glass's destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will we be staying here, Beta females?&quot; Betty asked as she approached Julie and Darla, who sat near the rocks where the Pack had first arrived on the island for the battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some portion of the pack will stay here until the humans leave,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;and then EVERYONE will return home. No exceptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty was quiet for a moment. Bethy and Tebby NEVER wanted to leave the island... at least not permanently, and her having to remind them that Darla and Julie were the Pack's betas and outside of a command from Jensen or Kaylee, they were to be obeyed, didn't set well within her. They accepted it, but it seemed to be a grudging acceptance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lawrence will also need to go home soon to have his arm put back into place,&quot; Julie added, &quot;he can not keep running around and dancing as you all have been. Or he will have to have that arm amputated because the bones, nerves and muscle died and atrophied to the point where the limb is useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we be free to do what we want?&quot; Betty asked, sounding more like a whining child then a person who should be a middle aged adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are consequences for everything,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;the laws we have are not to oppress and restrain people. They are there to protect people and allow society to function as a whole in a good and productive matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the situation with Lawrence has NOTHING to do with laws or being oppressed,&quot; Julie finished, &quot;I put that arm back into place, and told him NOT to use it for a few weeks. Kurse made him use it, and as you can see, it's no longer in place and needs to be put BACK in place. The situation with Lawrence has only what is best for Lawrence in mind. Do you want to see him lose an arm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Betty admitted after a few moments, &quot;but then why are you both still here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is our responsibility as betas,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;we would both be happier with or mate, our sister, and sister-wife. But we must. Abbey is here, looking after Glass. You refuse to go home. Sarah, Ulysses, and Mary are here to talk with the people that Kurse abducted... and Elise and Fox are somewhere... though they SHOULD be looking after Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if you weren't betas or didn't have to be here, you wouldn't?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a dark evil place where Kurse tried to steal our mate and sister wife from us,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;and do not DARE say they were happier that way... they were happier as they were. Anything in their minds now is a legacy of Kurse wanting us to be miserable. And hopefully Amy or someone can fix that to restore them to the way they were BEFORE Kurse decided she was our God. This island is a picture of Kurse's evil and all she did. Stealing pack mates... robbing the humanity of people who did not want to lose it... and then making them all behave in ways to amuse Kurse... do you understand how GUILTY Samantha presently feels for what Kurse made her do? I don't think you do, as you seem to think that what Kurse did here was &quot;pretty&quot;... likely another touch of her magic. Kurse is not someone to be defended... if she was... there would have been so much EVIL that went through what she did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty didn't argue any further. Even Tebby and Bethy sensed the sadness and anger at Kurse for what the witch had done to Jensen and Kaylee and the human yacht passengers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to check on the others,&quot; Betty spoke, &quot;we're all getting sleepy... it's been a LONG day and night.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Abbey sat among the rocks looking down at Glass, who still remained asleep. She had no clue why the other glass wolf slept on. She didn't sleep in the outside world... although she did go into the mirrorverse commonly with her sisters to sleep at night. She glanced up to see Betty talking with her mother and Aunt about something, and then over her shoulder to see Sarah, Ulysses, and Mary trying to make some progress with the passengers from the yacht. She then looked down to Glass again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we here?&quot; Trevor asked nervously, looking out the window of Serenity's car, &quot;Shouldn't we be finding away to find the people outside of Glendale that were cursed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy said that most of those transformations are reversing,&quot; Serenity told the lion boy, &quot;those that aren't are those who were already cursed in some way before... and how would I find them? I do not know the names of ALL the victims... even within Glendale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Jensen?&quot; Trevor asked, &quot;he seemed to know we were at the Hardys... he knew that Samantha had been sent back to their manor... certainly he can find these other victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He'd still need to know WHO he is looking for,&quot; Serenity commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Kathy?&quot; Trevor suggested, &quot;she might have been cursed again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a reason you don't want to see your folks?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked down, &quot;well... suppose all I end up doing is roaring... or whatever a lion cub does until he's able to roar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt that'll happen,&quot; Serenity commented, &quot;You've admitted to being friends with Mary and Judas... you aren't roaring now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid they won't remember me... won't like me,&quot; Trevor spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're your family, Trevor, go on,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;after what that second stringer did to you, you deserve this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor sighed and then got up and out of the car. Serenity went with him, to act as a guardian who had found and rescued him, in case they needed an explanation.<br />
<br />
Trevor slowly made his way up the sidewalk toward the front door to his home, in a small middle class neighborhood, not that far away from what had once been the Perkins home. He was nervous as he did so. He wondered what his parents would say... what he would say.<br />
<br />
Once he got to the door, he knocked once and waited quietly. After a few moments a woman in her mid to late forties came to the door. She looked down at Trevor for a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't be...&quot; the woman gasped, &quot;... it can't be... he...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; the woman demanded, &quot;we thought you were killed! The newspapers all said it was suicide...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry mom,&quot; Trevor said weakly, &quot;it was some guy. He came after me... I could barely get away and hide... he threatened to kill me if I ever showed up again and he saw me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My God,&quot; his mother gasped and hugged him, ignoring the fact that Trevor was eight and a lion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob!&quot; his mother, Marie, then called after a few moments, &quot;Our cub is home! And ALIVE! OUR CUB IS ALIVE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's alive?&quot; came a male voice from deeper inside the home, and soon a man about the same age as the woman, and once he saw Trevor he rapidly approached, &quot;he IS alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor found himself being hugged by both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd about given up all hope that the news report was wrong,&quot; Jacob told him, &quot;it's been so long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so happy to have you back Trevor,&quot; his mother said, &quot;You need not EVER mention the evil man who made you hide from us... Your sister will be excited to see you when she gets home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We love you, son, you know,&quot; Jacob told him<br />
<br />
That made Trevor feel extremely happy. They still loved him and had bought the story. They seemed to recognize him as having always been a lion cub... but then that was part of the transform the Hardys had gave the pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Trevor answered.<br />
<br />
And with that he felt something strange start to occur. He got the sensation that he was rising into the air. At first he thought he was being lifted up by some unknown force, but when his mother's eyes shifted from an emerald green to bright honey color, he began to see it... he had the pride's &quot;true love&quot; powers... and he was transforming his parents... but hadn't they been referring to romantic love?<br />
<br />
His mother's hug grew stronger as he felt her arm muscles enlarge and become covered in a gray and brown coat of fur, that resembled his own in many ways. He watched the hair on her head vanish and her ears move to the top of her head, and finished with her feline muzzle pushing out and teeth enlarging into fangs. He felt his own fur rubbing against his mother's and soon saw that both his parents were as naked as he was. And his father was standing erect in the now larger doorway with his dark brown mane and tawny gold fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, who is your friend here, Trevor?&quot; Jacob asked after a moment, noticing Serenity for the first time.</p>
