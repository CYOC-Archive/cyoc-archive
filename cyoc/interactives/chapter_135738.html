<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of two annoying frat boys from DeVry filled the air drawing all pairs of eyes towards the pair of men stumbling drunkly over the sand. Step by step they approached the volleyball court and one of them began laughing upon spotting Cameron and Bryce.<br />
<br />
“Hey it’s shit shit shi-urp!” The large black haired man with muscles as large as a bodybuilder laughed. His name was Xander. His buddy caught him and began leading him towards the two guys, taking a big swing of beer as he went.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing on our beach?” The smaller guy named Frank asked while waving his beer bottle around. Some of it poured onto the sand and Frank blinked and looked at it like the concept of spilled beer was alien to him.<br />
<br />
“We’re playing volleyball,” Bryce replied while narrowing his eyes, “Though I doubt a couple of morons from DeVry could beat us.”<br />
<br />
“I could beat you with a stick,” Frank growled aggressively before laughing hysterically, “We’ll beat you, I bet you don’t even know how to play Basketball...”<br />
<br />
Frank then proceeded to lead Xander to the other side of the court and put his beer down. Both men from DeVry stumbled about drunkly and Cameron readied the ball. A few seconds passed before Cameron tossed the ball up and spiked it. Xander bumped it, Frank set it, and Xander spiked it. It sailed towards the ground but Bryce dove and bumped it, Cameron set it, and then  Bryce scrambled to his feet and spiked it over the net. Xander managed to bump it but it proceeded to sail into the net. Xander and Frank groaned unaware that their bodies had started to change.<br />
<br />
Frank’s body actually got taller. He grew bigger and bigger until he matched his buddy in height. Meanwhile Xander’s body hair began to grow thicker. They shook their heads and Xander kicked the ball to Cameron who picked it up and whirled it in his hand. He proceeded to spike it and Frank dove for it but misjudged thanks to his new height. It bounced off his arm and hit the sand out of bounds. He and Xander both shuddered. Xander’s body hair began to increase even more, thick lumberjack hair sprouting from his chest, face, and belly. Frank on the other hand had his shoulders broaden to even more masculine levels than before.<br />
<br />
Frank stood up and when Cameron next served the ball he bumped it perfectly, Xander set it perfectly, and he spiked it perfectly. However the wind seemed to catch it because suddenly it sailed out of the court and landed out of bounds.<br />
<br />
“What?!” Frank demanded as his muscles began to be redistributed. He no longer looked like he skipped leg day. His entire body looked like he worked out constantly but now it was proper instead of just lifting weights in the gym and going drinking afterwards. Xander on the other hand began to grow hair where hair shouldn’t grow. On his palms, feet, and certain areas of his face. Black hair began to drown out his skin until you couldn’t tell what his skin rob was.<br />
<br />
A similar event to last time occurred when Cameron delivered his next spike. Xander went to bump it but found himself tripping over nothing and having the ball smash into the ground right in front of his face. He began to pant from the heat, his tongue lolling from his mouth much larger than before. Hot drool dripping off it and down onto the carpet of hair coating his body. Frank meanwhile had unnecessary fat vanish from his belly as it became more toned and natural. Less emphasis was put on the look of his muscles and more on their actual function.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately luck seemed to be against Frank as his new muscle distribution did nothing to help him stop the ball. The ball pounded sand next to him and his hair was suddenly shrinking down into a buzz cut. Meanwhile Xander’s nose turned black and shiny as he tried to keep his tongue in his mouth.<br />
<br />
The amount Xander could help was now severely limited and only became more limited when his face began to feel weird after another blow to the sand by the volleyball. His face pushed outwards into a muzzle, jowels fell over his teeth and the heat being absorbed by his coat of hair was ridiculous. Meanwhile Frank began to groan as alcohol drained from his body system and decomposed in his bloodstream leaving him completely sober.<br />
<br />
Being sober didn’t help with the fact Lady Luck seemed to be against them. Frank hit the ball perfectly over the net but it seemed to slow down and Bryce was able to bump it back over the net. The bump should have landed the ball out of bounds but instead it hit their court as if a better hit had been the force behind it. Frank cringed as his skin darkened a little gaining a heavy tan. Xander meanwhile felt his teeth rearrange into sharp biting canines and continued to pant in the heat.<br />
<br />
Xander’s ears perked up when he hit the ball out of bounds. Sharp triangles that improved his hearing tenfold. When Frank was hit in the face with the ball and it bounced out of bounds he felt his toes shrink as pads formed below his feet. He stood on his tiptoes as his heel expanded into another section of limb and claws popped up between the digits. Then when he and Frank bashed the ball into the net his hands went through a similar process. Finally when his foes hit the ball so expertly that it Bounced off both Xander and Frank his spine slipped him downwards until he couldn’t walk on two feet. He painted, holding the body of a dog.<br />
<br />
Through this Franks skin darkened until he was a six foot six broad shouldered black man who looked like he was in the military. Cameron and Bryce just couldn’t lose. They hit the ball sloppily and made mistakes often but nothing they did ever resulted in anything other than a point. One of these sloppy hits bashed the sand right next to Xander and his coat of fur suddenly shifted colour until he was a German Shepard dog. Meanwhile Frank’s swim shorts began to transform. The shorts gained underwear below them, a tank top appeared on his upper body and tucked itself into the shorts which lengthened and tucked themselves into boots. Socks appeared on Frank’s feet and he got up prepared for the next hit. It came and Frank basically had to play against two people while Xander jumped back and forth and barked, his mind being replaced by new instincts and training. The ball of course hit the sand and Frank had a jacket pulled around his body. He began to sweat from the heat and move slower. Each point the guys scored made it harder for Frank to play as each point landed more equipment on his back. A fifty pound bag, an armoured vest, a heavy helmet. His last name, deployment details, and blood type were sewn into the jacket as a gun was sling off him and suddenly Xander had a pack on. The guys continued to score goals against him and the heat made Frank want to waver. A leash attached itself to his hand and Xander and the ball was hit for a final time before suddenly the beach was gone. Frank walked through course rocky sand with Xander ahead of him sniffing at the dirt. The heat and sweat remained and before long Xander sat down.<br />
<br />
“Good Boy,” Frank smiles before pulling a flag from his back and marking the spot where the bomb sat. He was now saving lives and fighting for his country overseas by detecting bombs instead of getting drunk every day at a fraternity. Plus once his tour was over he planned to marry his girlfriend and start a family. He had his life a lot more together than he had earlier that morning.</p>
