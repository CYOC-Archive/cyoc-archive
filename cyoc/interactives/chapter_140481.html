<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenna hadn&#39;t seen hir mother in quite a long time and there was a good reason for that. Mike and Laura had been employees in the same company when they first met and married, but Laura&#39;s ambition far surpassed Mike&#39;s. In a bit of a reversal of stereotypes, it was the workaholic mother who abandoned her family to further her career and left her ex-husband to raise the kids. Mike had never fully recovered from that, until Jenna had given him a mighty lion&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Jenna still felt some hurt over hir mother&#39;s desertion. But shi knew that hir mother will eventually return. The Father of the Pride package would inevitably draw her back and make her part of Mike&#39;s pride. Jenna felt some resentment towards hir mother, but surprisingly, shi also felt possessive of Mike. Shi had been helping him as much as he was raising hir. Shi was the one who loved him truly. Shi was his mate and bearing his cubs. Shi would be a better mother than Laura ever would be. Jenna didn&#39;t want to share Mike with Laura.<br />
<br />
But maybe there was another way. Shi still had the Chronivac after all. Shi pulled up the Father of the Pride package and set it to target Laura too, as well as give her the hermaphrodite option. That would keep her busy for quite some time, enough time for Jenna to work on hir own pride.<br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
Laura had advanced very far since she left Mike. Without the tediousness of raising a family to hold her back, she had risen nearly all the way to the top. But it was the &#39;nearly&#39; part that grated at her. She had risen as high as junior executive when her upwards climb had come to a halt. True, she had her own office, a substantial paycheck, and a secretary, but not the respect she felt she was due. It was obvious to her that &#39;junior executive&#39; meant that she was just high enough for the more senior executives to know of her, but not enough to actually acknowledge her.<br />
<br />
She knew exactly what the problem was. Everyone higher in the company than her was a man. It didn&#39;t matter if they were young or old, they were all male. Laura had risen higher than any other woman in the history of the company, but there was a glass ceiling that she couldn&#39;t break through.<br />
<br />
Laura paced her office in frustration before stopping to look in her mirror. She was in rather good shape. She had on a professional grey business suit, the skirt part of it only because she wanted it, not because of the pressure of the executive boy&#39;s club. She worked hard to keep her body fit. The only benefit of having a son was that it gave her breasts and hips enough extra mass to make her more noticeable. Her face wasn&#39;t lined yet and her makeup made her look a few years younger. Her cinnamon-colored hair was tied up in a professional bun. In total, Laura was a perfect example of a businesswoman who made professional look good. &quot;And yet the only thing those fools will notice are these,&quot; she muttered to herself, putting one hand on her chest and another on her hip. &quot;The only way they&#39;d take me seriously is if I had a dick between my legs,&quot; she griped.<br />
<br />
Just then, Laura felt a brief spell of dizziness which was quickly replaced by a surge of energy. She felt like every muscle in her body was bulging with strength. Laura looked looked in the mirror and saw that muscles were literally bulging with strength. Her expensive suit was quickly becoming too snug as her body was putting on more muscle than she ever had in her life. She also noticed she was growing taller and her breasts were becoming even bigger than when she was pregnant.<br />
<br />
Laura felt a bit of pain in her fingernails, which made her look down at them. The nail polish on them were cracking, revealing darkening and sharpening claws. Her hands were growing bigger as well as pads appeared on her palms. Her shoes bulged and buckled as her feet suddenly got too big for them. With one &#39;pop&#39; and another, her shoes burst open to reveal a pair of feline paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those...cost...200...dollarrrs...&quot; groaned Laura, her voice deepening into a growl as her face started to push out into a muzzle, her nose becoming a black triangle as her teeth started to get sharper. Her ears grew furry and round as they started moving up her head. Her hair bun was becoming too full as her hair gained much more volume. With a &#39;snap&#39;, the hair tie broke as her long hair cascaded down to her lower back.<br />
<br />
Laura&#39;s suit was quickly losing the battle to her changing body. Her suit was ripping everywhere, revealing growing muscles and sandy fur. Her back was ripping enough that her new tail was able to grow out. Just when Laura thought things couldn&#39;t get worse, she felt a completely alien surge in her groin. At the same time, her skirt started to tent out. There was a pressure and pleasure she had never felt before growing stronger as the tenting became more obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; she said before using her new claws to tear open her skirt. She had a brief image of badly stretched panties before they snapped and a big dick popped out, a pair of balls dropping down to hang underneath them. Laura jumped in surprise before reaching down to feel hir new sack. Behind it, shi rediscovered hir pussy, which was now getting very wet. Shi slid hir hand up to grasp hir new cock before moaning with pleasure. What had started as simple feeling soon turned into active stroking. Laura reached up with hir other hand to cup one of hir much larger breasts, which had long since burst out of hir bra. Pinching hir nipple while pumping hir cock brought hir to a level of pleasure shi didn&#39;t knew existed. Before long, Laura had to bite back a roar as hir cock shot its first load.<br />
<br />
Laura looked in the mirror to see what shi had become. Instead of an attractive businesswoman, shi was now a tall, buff hermaphroditic lioness. Shi had to be at least two feet taller than before and shi had muscles to make any man jealous. But shi wasn&#39;t just bulk. Her breasts had grown all the way to E-cups and hir wide hips and muscular butt were still very sexy. Shi was covered in sandy-brown fur except for hir cinnamon-colored hair which hung down to hir ass, a tuft at the end of hir tail, and a treasure trail leading to hir altered groin. Hir dick was still hard and needy, standing a proud 9 inches at least. Hir new ballsack held a pair of orbs that were the size of lemons and the pussy behind them was soaking wet and wanting attention.<br />
<br />
Laura grinned at hir reflection, liking hir new body. &quot;Well, I said I needed a dick,&quot; shi said, patting hir new rod, &quot;Didn&#39;t expect what came with it.&quot; Shi probably should have questioned why shi had transformed like that. People didn&#39;t change species, let alone genders, for no reason besides a complaint towards no one in particular. However, Laura was too turned-on to put any thought into it.<br />
<br />
But Laura wasn&#39;t sated yet. Shi need more than to pleasure hirself. Shi needed to mate. A new instinct was telling hir to find other people, start building a pride. Laura could think of a few people: hir secretary, hir pathetic ex-husband, even some of those chauvinistic snobs who looked down at hir for too long. Laura grinned. Shi was going to enjoy showing those executives how much bigger shi was in every way, before making them into hir bitches.</p>
