<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally sees a middle aged woman with a spray tan and a bobbed beach bottle blonde haircut came into the bathroom. She took one look at Sally, sitting on the floor heavily pregnant, gave a slight &quot;harumph&quot; before retreating into one of the stalls, completely ignoring Sally&#39;s distress.<br />
<br />
Sally recognized the type, a &quot;Karen&quot; if ever there was one, and one that had just earned Sally&#39;s ire for ignoring her inability to get up off the floor.<br />
<br />
From inside the stall, Sally heard &quot;Karen&quot; dialing her cellphone and begin to chat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen? Don&#39;t bother coming here. The staff is completely incompetent. They tried saying that they don&#39;t have enough employees to cover this shift, but I pointed out the manager could be doing something instead of sitting on their lazy ass. Then some grease-stained boy with acne comes up claiming he&#39;s the manager and he&#39;s busy cooking, and says that if I want my food any faster, why don&#39;t I grab a spatula and help out a little. The nerve of some people!&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon hearing that, Sally decided that perhaps it was time to test the remote again. She&#39;d changed clothes and reality... what else could it do? With that thought, Sally decided that she&#39;d press the button labeled TG. The change at first wasn&#39;t obvious until she heard &quot;Karen&quot; speak again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, babe, I don&#39;t have time to argue with you right now. I&#39;ve got to grab and go for my next meeting,&quot; said a notably masculine voice.<br />
<br />
Sally pressed the clothes button as she heard &quot;Ken&quot; fumble with his formerly feminine clothes. The changes must have been effective for the next few moments Ken came out of the bathroom dressed in a respectable business casual attire. Ken was a rugged looking middle aged man with a bit of thickness to his build. He wasn&#39;t overweight, but he certainly wasn&#39;t lean and athletic. His blonde hair had streaks of gray in it, especially near his temples which he wore with pride. He crossed to the bathroom, and Sally contemplated that while his attitude perhaps was less bitchy, but nevertheless still had a high opinion of himself and a low opinion of everyone else, especially given how he didn&#39;t even spare a look at her. Well, Sally figured she could help deflate that ego a bit, and so she pressed the (-) button on the age and watched as Ken&#39;s gray hairs became blonde again, his thickness waned as a rather fit and sexy younger man came into existence, with a decidedly cocky grin as he looked at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He&#39;ll still have to go further back, Sally figured. And soon the young adult began to lose his build further as his muscles deflated, his build changed from lean to thin and then to gawky as he became a teenager once again. His angular facial features softened and rounded, making his face appear more boyish and less manly. His height also took a bit of a toll as he reentered puberty. Sally stopped when the gawky teenager&#39;s face had not only broken out in acne, his large hands and feet looked out of place on his smaller body, his blonde hair was a tad long and shaggy, and braces had appeared on his once gleaming white smile. Ken&#39;s look of horror in the mirror the fraction of a second between when she&#39;d lifted her finger from the (-) button and pressed the clothes button, told Sally that she had in fact accomplished what she&#39;d aimed to do to &quot;Karen&quot;, now Kenny, as the badge on his uniform now identified him as. Kenny was now a fourteen year old whose first job was working here, and he was on bathroom cleaning duty.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry m&#39;am, but I didn&#39;t see you in here,&quot; apologized Kenny who lowered his head and avoided her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine, I could use a bit of help, given my condition anyway,&quot; said Sally, wondering if she should give &quot;Kenny&quot; the opportunity to get a proper family experience that wouldn&#39;t leave him a little shit at the end of it.<br />
<br />
It was then that one of the women from behind the counter came in--the one which looked to be about Sally&#39;s age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kenny, are you--my god, are you all right miss?&quot; asked the young woman as she immediately came to Sally&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just slipped and fell on my rear is all, nothing hurt but my pride,&quot; said Sally as though she were trying to laugh off her situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kenny, help me get this lady up, now!&quot; insisted the woman, and Kenny immediately was on the other side of Sally, placing his hands underneath her arm in a mirror way to which the woman was and shortly thereafter Sally was once again on her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you... Trish for helping me,&quot; said Sally as she noticed the woman&#39;s name tag. Given her reaction and immediate sense of authority, Sally figured she&#39;d make the perfect mother for Kenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all a problem, I&#39;m just surprised that our newbie here wasn&#39;t already helping you up,&quot; said Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was just about to, I&#39;m sure. He hadn&#39;t noticed me and was startled just before you came in,&quot; said Sally as she aimed the Chronivac at Kenny and hit the (-) button. Immediately Kenny&#39;s thin frame began to compress on itself as he shrunk out of his uniform. He left the gawky teenager phase for that of a prepubescent boy. His braces disappearing and his blonde hair appearing a bit messier as he continued to shrink and grow smaller, his clothes changing with him as Sally had kept the clothes and reality switches flipped on as she&#39;d changed him. It was amazing him to see his uniform shift into pricey normal looking clothes and then as he left the double digits of life to more durable play wear of jean overalls over top a simple tee-shirt. His sneakers and socks simply shrinking along with his feet. His hair now took on a bowl cut and his clothes appeared less durable and simply just a bit more worn as he began approaching preschool age. It was at this age Sally noticed that Kenny no longer looked bright-eyed, but instead more shy as he grabbed a hold of Trish&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kenny, there&#39;s no need to hide,&quot; said Trish as the now toddler Kenny clung to the back of Trish&#39;s pant leg. The connection to Kenny was still maintained despite Trish&#39;s leg making it more difficult to point the remote at him. It&#39;s like once the connection to Kenny had been made, it didn&#39;t matter where or what got in the way, the change would continue and only continue on what had been locked on at the beginning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need to use the changing station, perhaps?&quot; asked Sally as she noticed Kenny&#39;s overalls seemed to puff out around his bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;He could use a change,&quot; agreed Trish as she pulled Kenny&#39;s hands off her clothes and hoisted the young toddler up--as she did, his clothes except for his tee shirt a diaper, and socks disappearing as he grew younger to just a year old--his eyes wide and curious. That would likely be enough, but Sally decided to give Trish as much of a head start in her new life as she could. Soon, a newborn Kenny was being laid down on the changing station and then a moment later, Trish&#39;s belly expanded until it looked nine months large, nearly causing Trish to fall over, until Sally steadied her with her arm. The falter nearly sent them both to the floor, but Sally helped them both to maintain their balance, especially important as she kept her finger on the (-) button as Trish&#39;s belly shrank--and it was only as her belly shrank until it hardly looked pregnant at all did Sally lift her finger up off the button.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry that you slipped ma&#39;am,&quot; said Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all, it was an accident,&quot; assured Sally.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re fine, please excuse me, I came in here on my break to settle an... issue I&#39;ve been having,&quot; said Trish.<br />
<br />
&quot;By all means,&quot; said Sally, stepping out of the way as Trish entered one of the stalls.  Sally heard the rustle of clothes and heard a woman&#39;s sigh as the sound of splashing water came from the stall. Sally waited for Trish to come out. After she heard the flushing of the toilet, she heard Trish shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD! I&#39;M PREGNANT&quot;, shouted Trish as she ran out of the stall holding out a pregnancy stick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was this planned?&quot;, asked Sally, knowing that Kenny must have regressed to almost the point of conception. Kenny would have a second chance from the very beginning--and hopefully wouldn&#39;t grow up to be so much of a jerk as he had been when he was older.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes Mike and I having been trying for months&quot;, smiled Trish happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well congratulations on the new baby,&quot; grinned Sally.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to tell Mike right now,&quot; said Trish as she rushed out the door.</p>
