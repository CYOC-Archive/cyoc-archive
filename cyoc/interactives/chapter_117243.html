<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan hated his life.  He hated everything about his life since he was born.  His job as an accountant sucks, he was single, and most of his friends are assholes.  The reason why is because of one thing…  He’s a man and he truly hates men.  They were slobs and jerks that thing that they are the dominant species.  Always treating women as trophy wives and having huge egos.<br />
<br />
He even hated himself for being a man as well.  Sure he was just an average build and does his best to stay fit.  But nothing compared to his roommate, Carlos, who is a body building jock and has a huge ego and matching muscles to boot.  It disgusted him and he was more buff than him, and he is disgusted by himself because of who he is.  So much so, it that there was a time that he always wish that he was a woman.<br />
<br />
That’s right, during his days growing up; Ethan believed that he didn’t belong in a male dominant world.  That females have more freedom than males as they are well independent, mature, and responsible than their opposite counterparts.  Hell, there was a time that he believes that he wished the world would be all female, as the male side would drive the human race to extinction.  If there were some way to help make his dreams a reality, then and only then that he would have a much happier life.<br />
<br />
As he was walking, he felt something on his shoe and was a little curious at what he stepped on.  “Christ, what now?” he asked in annoyance, “If I accidentally stepped on dog turd, then I’ll be really upset.”  Lifting his foot up, he soon discovered that there was a strange looking ring on the ground and looks to be shining.  He starred at it and asked himself.  “Huh…  That’s a nice looking ring?  I wonder who would lost something like that?”  Thinking about it, he picked it up with his fingers and placed it in his palm.  “Oh well, might as well call the police and see if they can keep it until the owner returns.  Whoever lost it would be worried.”<br />
<br />
He continued to walk, as he wanted to give this to the authorities.  But looking at this ring, something compelled him to wear it.  It might sound a little corny, but there’s something special about it that is telling him to wear it.  After a bit of thought, he shrugged it off and said, “What the hell?  Might as well wear this ring for a little bit.  I’m sure that this person won’t worry too much if I have it on for a while.”<br />
<br />
Slowly, he started to slide the ring into in middle finger as he thought it would be title.  But that wasn’t the case as it fit comfortably on him.  He found it strange, as he never thought that it would fit perfectly.  “Hmm…  Guess the term, ‘One size fits all’ seems to be out of the question.  So he then decided to head back to his apartment, feeling a little better with the ring on his finger.<br />
<br />
After fifteen minutes of walking, he made it to the apartment complex as he took the elevator to two-bed apartment.  Entering through the door, he looked around and sighed at the sight of it.  Normally, a two-bedroom dorm would have a living room, small kitchen, a bathroom, and two bedrooms for two people.  But for his roommate, he turned most of the living room into his own small gym.  On the floor were heavy weights and exercising equipment while posters were posted up showing buffed up men he wanted to be.  On the table were powder and pill like containers to help him gain muscles.  And the kitchen was recently used to make his protein shakes, yet he never cleaned much of it.  Long story short, it had become a hoarder room for a body builder.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked at all of this and sighed in defeat.  “Seriously…” he said, “Again…?  I swear, Carlos is a pig even if it meant working out.  Every time I come back, I had to clean up all of his messes.  It’s really driving me to the point that I can’t take it anymore.  Awe well, might as well get started before he returns.  I’m certain that he’ll mess it up again.”<br />
<br />
He soon approached the work out area to begin the clean up.  Looking down, he noticed a model magazine and picked it up.  Opening it up, he was disgusted in seeing all these muscle bound male models posing and flexing in their swimming trunks and Speedos.  The sight of them completely annoyed Ethan as he said, “God…  Look at this!  Does Carlos always think about half naked men and nothing more.  Damn it…  I just wish this magazine has hot women in these pages then just all that man meat.”<br />
<br />
As he said that, he didn’t know that the ring that he has on his finger was starting to glow, excepting the wish.  As Ethan looked to the magazine and skimming through the pages, he noticed something off.  He didn’t know it as first, but it looked like all the male models were getting thinner and their muscles deflating, each page he turns.  He blinked and said to himself, “What the…”  He turned back the magazine and wondered if it’s his own imagination.  Turns out, he was wrong, as the models kept on getting skinnier, but also other changes as well.<br />
<br />
He saw their chests expanding with fat and going round, their hips increasing and hourglasses forming, their rears expanding and bubbly, and their muscles decreasing but toning.  He even finds it really strange that their faces molded from males like to female and their hair, no matter what color or styles growing down and rearranging.  But what was surprising the most is that he could see their packages on their crotches shrinking away until they are completely smooth over and all of their swim wear shifted and mysterious clothes wrapped around their chests and hung tightly around them.  Soon enough, he was shocked to see that all the male models turned into female models on each page, complete with breasts ranging from C-DD cups, curvy hourglasses, shapely asses, beautiful faces, and long hair that were styles up for the camera.  He could even see their attire turned into sexy looking two-piece bathing suits with revealing looks and posing very sexily.<br />
<br />
Ethan saw all of this and was amazed by the looks of it.  “Whoa!!  Did all those men turned into women right before my eyes?  That seems impossible!  How do they change like that in a matter of moments?!  It doesn’t make any sense!”  He got curious and wondered how a magazine filled with muscle bound men turned into voluptuous sexy women.  Looking down his hand, he noticed that ring on his finger was getting curious.  Giving that he obtained the ring, he wondered if that was the cause of it.  To that, he needs to test it out to see if his theory is correct.<br />
<br />
He soon started to look around the living area and wondered what else to change.  After much skimming through, he spotted the one thing that he hated the most.  Over the sofa is a poster of a super buff body builder flexing in his super tight trunks.  That picture always disturbs him, but his roommate seems to like it.  Looking down to the ring and back to the poster, he starts to wonder if he can used the ring on the poster.  Outreaching his hand to it, he closed his eyes and said, “I wish the body builder on the poster turns into a super hot and sexy woman with a raunchy swimsuit, posing very seductively.”  As he made that next wish, his ring started to glow and the changes started.<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, he looked to see if the poster starts to change.  After a few good seconds, he could see the body builder on the poster was moving on his own as his body begins to thin and loose a lot of muscle mass.  During the changes, he could see most of the muscle transferring to his chest and rear as they grew in mass and weight.  His hips grew out and curved in the middle while his eight back disappeared on his stomach but toned and flat.  His muscles were thinning incredibly, but turned into feminine muscles that were hard with a womanly touch.  The body builder’s buzz cut hair grew out and down to his mid back while his face molded into what looked like that of a pretty young woman.  To top off the body transformation, his big crotch shrunk away until it vanished, leaving nothing but a smooth over privates.  His, or her, tight trunks shrunk and turned into a thin string bikini bottom as the top half covered his chest and revealed to be small pieces of fabric covering just her nipples.  He watched in awe as the changes were finished and all he sees is a beautiful and sexy woman posing very sexually and pouting her lips to Ethan.<br />
<br />
He looked on and couldn’t believe that he turned the body builder on the poster into a hot woman.  “Wow!” he said in pure excitement, “It actually worked!  The ring turned that buffed up, steroid infused, douche bag into a sexy woman!  This ring is magical!!”  He looked to the ring and realized what he can do.  “Hmm…  If this ring is magical, then I can change all those pig like men into hot and beautiful women, maybe make the whole world run by women with no men in sight.  That would be a lovely sight.”  Looking to the ring, he asked himself, “Now then, should I use this ring on?”</p>
