<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Ben Twist received the phone call, he couldn&#39;t picture why Anna O&#39;Sullivan said she wanted to talk to him, let alone it would be nice if he could come over now.<br />
After leaving a note for his moms, walking out the front door, Ben saw Cassie walking inside the Anderson house with her new boyfriend Eric, so figured it might have something to do with that. Which, when he got to the O&#39;Sullivan residence, turned out to be the correct answer.<br />
&quot;So,&quot; began Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan, after serving sodas, &quot;I&#39;ve heard Eric and Cassie&#39;s sides of the story, but if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to hear yours too. What made you think Eric Anderson and my daughter would be a good match?&quot;<br />
There was no anger in her voice or question. Just curiosity.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; began Ben, &quot;when Nate approached Austin with Eric&#39;s request to become a werewolf, being their friend and next door neighbor, Austin contacted me for my thoughts on the situation. Eric losing his father because of that damn rogue werevixen certainly was no secret, and Austin wanted to make sure Eric was making the right decision for the right reasons.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s understandable,&quot; agreed Anna, &quot;but how did that lead to Cassie?&quot;<br />
&quot;When my mom Frances finally told Austin that it was okay for Eric to become a werewolf, since she was seeing him professionally for grief counseling, the only thing Austin knew was that Eric wanted to be with a female, because he doesn&#39;t share his older brother Nate&#39;s preferences,&quot; continued Ben. &quot;Anyway, Austin&#39;s always believes that a person&#39;s first time should—&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait a second,&quot; said Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan, interrupting him. &quot;Eric Anderson was both a normal AND a virgin?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. Didn&#39;t you know?&quot; asked Ben in return.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; admitted Anna, &quot;but that certainly raises my opinion of him. Go on.&quot;<br />
&quot;As you know, the ceremony differs between inducting a normal and welcoming a naturally born were. With the first, you need someone willing to turn the normal while with the second, it&#39;s just a question of having someone with you to help ease the transition of your first transformation,&quot; said Ben, going over basic were lore. &quot;Anyway, Austin believes that a person&#39;s first time should be special, but Eric didn&#39;t have any preferences other than gender, so Austin left it to me and I picked Cassie.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked her mother.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard a lot of this already,&quot; replied Ben. &quot;They&#39;re both smart 14 year old Freshmen, and have been through the traumatic experience of losing their fathers, which caused them to decide to dedicate their lives to helping others. But what you probably didn&#39;t know is that Julie Stovall had her eyes on Eric ever since his family moved to Moon Lake, and while I didn&#39;t foresee events happening the way they did with her winding up in the hospital and everything, I knew she wouldn&#39;t be happy if Eric became something other than a weremerman. So when Austin left it to me to pick, I chose someone that would at least be Eric&#39;s friend, if not more.&quot;<br />
Then he paused, raising his right hand to scratch the back of his head to express his nervous tic, before Ben asked, &quot;Did you happen to hear two werewolves howling in joy last night?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. It woke me up and—&quot; then Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan stopped at the realization of what the howling signified. &quot;You mean...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. For my first effort, my matchmaking skills are better than I thought. Cassie and Eric have truly fallen in love and bonded. That howl was the proclamation of their union after Cassie let Eric <i>claim</i> her as his she-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew the two of them were growing crazy for each other, but...&quot; then Anna paused, recalling her own past. &quot;It wasn&#39;t that long after I turned her father George that we did the same thing,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;Did you know that Cassie called Austin earlier today and asked for her name to be removed from the welcoming list? I did the same thing after George <i>claimed</i> me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? I knew A relationship would be good for both of them, but this far surpasses anything I ever expected,&quot; admitted Ben.<br />
Then, before Ben could say another word, Anna O&#39;Sullivan moved closer and gave him a long, passionate kiss.<br />
&quot;Err, Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan,&quot; began Ben when their lips parted, while scratching behind his head again.<br />
&quot;Sshhh,&quot; said Anna gently, as she unbuttoned his shirt just enough to slip her hand inside and play with his chest hair. &quot;I&#39;m not looking for any kind of relationship or long term commitment, but seeing Eric and Cassie together has started to rekindle something within me that I thought was lost forever when my husband died. I know you&#39;ve had sex with Cassie...&quot;<br />
&quot;But that was just recreational, and as active weres, she is legal in Moon Lake&#39;s private laws,&quot; said the 16 year old high school junior.<br />
&quot;All I&#39;m offering is some recreational time with me,&quot; said Anna, as she snuggled closer to him on the couch. &quot;I haven&#39;t felt this way in years. Not only has my libido suddenly become VERY active again after a long absence, if I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d swear I&#39;m going into heat too! I&#39;ve stayed on the werewolf birth control pill all this time. Just consider it either a favor to me or a thank you for getting Cassie and Eric together. What do you say? I&#39;m developing a serious need here, but want to be with someone I know and trust. Please?&quot; she asked, before kissing him again.<br />
<br />
Ben looked at her. Technically, Anna O&#39;Sullivan was pushing 60, by human standards. But for weres, the clock seriously slowed down once they turned 21, so Cassie&#39;s mother didn&#39;t appear more than 22 or 23 at most, and was still VERY beautiful <i>and</i> sexy. Although, considering everything she&#39;d been through following the untimely death of her husband and trying to raise their daughter alone, she did act far older at times.<br />
He knew Anna never went to a pack meeting since George&#39;s death unless it was absolutely necessary, and even then she only stayed long enough for official business, so Ben had absolutely no idea when the last time she did anything... recreational was.<br />
The werewolf within him could smell the pheromones rising in the she-wolf. He felt his own lupine urges wanting to take over and show her a howling good time.<br />
That was the last straw as Ben grabbed her hand and said, &quot;Where&#39;s your bedroom?&quot;<br />
&quot;Upstairs,&quot; Anna O&#39;Sullivan said with a smile, rising from the couch, &quot;and Cassie isn&#39;t due home till her 10 pm curfew.&quot; The living room wall clock revealed it wasn&#39;t even 5 yet, giving them plenty of time.<br />
&quot;Good. Mine isn&#39;t until 11, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll understand why I don&#39;t want to be here when she gets home.&quot;<br />
&quot;She&#39;s having supper with Eric and his family, at his mom&#39;s invitation,&quot; said Anna, as she led the way upstairs. &quot;Don&#39;t know what they&#39;re planning to do afterwards, but as long as she&#39;s happy and stays on her pill...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Anna O&#39;Sullivan led Ben Twist into the master bedroom at the end of the upstairs hallway. Quickly closing the door, the two kissed and wasted no time undressing as the heat of the moment overtook each other.<br />
Within moments both were nude, with Anna laying on her back across the king size bed and her legs wide open.<br />
Ben smiled as he guided the head of his hard cock toward the now very wet entrance to Anna&#39;s cunt.<br />
&quot;Now!&quot; was all she said, urging Ben into her without any foreplay.<br />
As he sank deep inside, Anna wrapped her legs around him, and told Ben to &quot;Fuck me!&quot;<br />
The teenager wasted no time complying with the request, pushing until he &quot;bottomed out&quot; as his balls hit the outer boundary of her body. <br />
Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan moaned as Ben started moving faster, harder, and deeper with every stroke.<br />
<br />
As he continued pistoning his cock in and out of her, red fur began spreading out across Anna&#39;s body, as a sex starved she-wolf soon took the place of the sex-starved human woman that initiated this, even as Ben felt his own body change.<br />
Soon Ben&#39;s lupine red rocket was within the female beneath him well past its top knot, even as Ben continued onward at Anna&#39;s urging.<br />
It wasn&#39;t much longer before both wolves howled in pleasure at the mutual orgasms they experienced together.<br />
Spent, Ben laid on top of Anna, feeling the hard nipples of her breasts poking against his chest, even as they cuddled and kissed.<br />
When Anna O&#39;Sullivan finally caught her breath, a big smile appeared on her muzzle as the she-wolf asked, &quot;How soon before you can fuck me again?&quot;<br />
The twitch of Ben Twist&#39;s still hard lupine cock deep within her proved that it wouldn&#39;t be very long at all.</p>
