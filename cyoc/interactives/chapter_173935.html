<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully you saw that yep, there was still plenty of daylight for you to apply your craft. Assuming you could find people who&#39;d sit still long enough, you were good, but you didn&#39;t have super speed! <br />
<br />
What WOULD happen to reality if you offered to make someone a toon and they accepted? What would they remember agreeing to then? That needed some exploring maybe. <br />
<br />
Adria meanwhile took one of your arms like it was a teddy bear and leans on your slightly, it only now occurred to you that you&#39;d actually made her taller than you! <br />
<br />
Setting foot on the cozy city street, Adria whispered in your ear, <br />
<br />
&quot;Confession time. I kinda sorta maybe didn&#39;t completely believe you before. It was like, such a stupid lie I figured there was no way it WASN&#39;T true! And it was too big a chance since it&#39;s true, and if it turned out it was just a gag, we could have a good laugh about it sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure what part startled you the most, you replied, &quot;So you ...remember what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
She struck a thinking pose while still holding onto you. &quot;Well, it&#39;s kinda hard to explain. I remember clear as crystal you painting that old dragon and her treasure hoard, and it sliding off the page... but... the memory that she was anything other than the only other toon in the world feels like some old dream I had once. I think it&#39;s my brain trying to get the two ideas to make friends so they don&#39;t nukes each other and blow up my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Given she was a living breathing cartoon character, you honestly wondered if that was an actual metaphor! <br />
<br />
She then hopped in front of you. You were dimly aware that the people around you seemed not at all confused or alarmed at a living naked cartoon wolf walking down the street. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! If you made me a cartoon wolf because that&#39;s your style...just a imagine!&quot; Images appeared in her eyes like a TV screen. &quot;You could turn people into literal works of art, or fairies, or robot, or mannequins! The only limit is your imagination!&quot; Her grin got wider and wider. &quot;You like, totally have access to God&#39;s debug mode!&quot; <br />
<br />
You swear you heard a church hymn at that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heck! You made her treasure hoard right? That means you can solve like every resource shortage in existence!!! ... Not that people will need much once everyone is a cartoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wondered at the paradox of a cartoon without an audience, (and Adria winked at the computer screen), but first you asked, <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a toon, can you do impossible things already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adria rolled her eyes, but stopped with a screech. &quot;... I keep forgetting you actually don&#39;t remember anything. It&#39;s sort of like rubber. I can stretch things out, including myself, but it&#39;ll always snap back into place by next scene.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Next scene?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh! After a while I mean! So I can survive eating a dynamite turkey, but if anything I make is gonna last, it&#39;ll have to be with stuff that&#39;s already there. That&#39;s like I can&#39;t make a veggie dish out of thin air and expect it to be useful for anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hearing how ambitious Adria was getting, you said out loud, &quot;I&#39;m curious if I can modify something I&#39;ve already done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adria guessed what you meant and said, &quot;Ha, how could you improve on perfection sweetie?&quot; She said the last part close in a sultry voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the apartment is a mess, and you like doing chores, maybe I can try to paint you in a nice maid outfit,&quot; you couldn&#39;t help but grin back, her reckless cheer was a little contagious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hot-stuff there&#39;s a whole world out here, you can &#39;find&#39; a good domestic servant easy peasy!&quot; Adria said quickly waving her paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were the toon and I was the artist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well! Yeah! But that doesn&#39;t mean I can give some feedback! I mean, knocking on the forth wall is what I do.&quot; She said, knocking on the glass of your computer screen... which you failed to notice utterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I do wonder if there are limits... can I paint tomorrow&#39;s winning lotto numbers? Can I paint the cure for cancer? Or would it be just a container with the words &#39;cancer cure&#39; on it?... I want to test something.&quot; You set up the canvas, near a waist high wall around the apartment building, and painted a brown leather book with the golden title &#39;Big Book Of All The Answer.&#39; The book did indeed slide off the page.  Adria looked eagerly as you opened it... It could only be opened in the middle, like a book from a cartoon show.<br />
<br />
All you found on the pages were the words &#39;Nice try.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, so much for that,&quot; Adria sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can only create things I know and understand? I know how a cartoon works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I know one of you pathetic humans would fold like a house of cards if you had perfection like mine,&quot; she said holding up her impossibly huge bosom supported by her comically thin waist. &quot;So it&#39;s a good thing I wasn&#39;t painted &#39;real&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hadn&#39;t thought about that, but she had a point. <br />
<br />
&quot;But cartoons aren&#39;t supposed to be real to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m here, so that disproves that thank you very much,&quot; Adria stuck her paws on her hips and pointed her nose up.  <br />
<br />
You sighed. &quot;... I wonder if there&#39;s a way to fix you, this is gonna be fun and all, but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fix me how? I want to have puppies some day, well,&quot; she looked down at her smooth body devoid of the finer sexual details in spite of being overwhelmingly female in shape. &quot;You know what I mean.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No no! I mean maybe reverse it make you human again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Adria got pale. &quot;No no no! Let&#39;s NOT do that! I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m still whoever I was before, just with improvements. That the old dragon didn&#39;t just go along with whatever you said means we&#39;re not just zombies or something right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe you just WANTED to believe her more than anything, and just have a thin excuse to explore this power as much as possible, but you nodded. &quot;Alright, I guess that makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ALRIGHT THEN!&quot; In a swirl of motion, Adria was wearing a white toga with a ring of flowers over her head. &quot;Let me be your muse oh artist! Let me inspire you to greatness as the progenitor of toon kind!&quot; <br />
<br />
You looked at a jogger going in one direction, a family driving in a car in another, another person briskly rushing on the sidewalk, followed by a blond skateboarder. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be easy finding people sitting still long enough for me to do a painting of...&quot;<br />
<br />
Adria shook a paw at the heavens. &quot;Curse you our fast paced modern society that supports the vast infrastructure we blindingly take for granted!&quot; <br />
<br />
You thought for a minute. &quot;People behind store counters aren&#39;t likely to move around. And maybe people window shopping...people working out at the gym would be tricky but maybe possible... ugh! What happens if I&#39;m not able to finish a sketch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then they&#39;re only half-upgraded, duh. Not THAT big a deal,&quot; Adria shrugged.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Still wish there was a way I could just offer free sketches or transformations without the changes in reality messing things up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll figure something out cutie,&quot; she said patting you on the shoulder. She then pointed, &quot;And opportunity knocks.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
A parked car, an expired parking meter, a traffic cop looking ready to take out their ticket book. Adria was right, but you had to act fast! <br />
<br />
Setting up the easel and canvas, and framing the police office just right, you took out some black and orange paint and quickly got to work.<br />
<br />
You stated with the long ropy black tail with a couple strokes, having to skip the sketch phase again. His boots were covered by bright orange digigrated paws, that shifted to shapely black legs, with brownish gray highlights to keep it from being a black void in existence. His blue paints vanished as you finished with some oversized hips the tail was connected to. You took some paint that was roughly the same color as the car and &#39;painted away&#39; his waist to something that couldn&#39;t, or hadn&#39;t been able to exist in reality. <br />
<br />
And of course, next came the bosom, two perfectly orange round globes with no nipples as they were held up in spite of what gravity said. Her long black arms were next and her orange paws with a thumb as she wrote the ticket. You took some blue and painted a collar around her neck followed by a police bag banging down from the collar. <br />
<br />
Finally the head, pointy orange ears and orange muzzle with a large black nose and face, red eyes calmly and focused on her work. You finished with the hat, not doing much other than painting it over.<br />
<br />
Having finished with the ticket, the busty toon cop hid the book and her pen inside her cleavage, that you could guess the rest of equipment was. Her job done, she continued along, an obvious sway in her hips and steps as she walked out of frame, her new self moving out of the picture with her.<br />
<br />
Adria waved at her, and the mostly naked police dog woman waved back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... not bad with Tonya,&quot; Adria remarked. &quot;Buuuuuut, maybe slightly boring, I mean, she&#39;s still just a cop, just a perfect toon gal cop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s wrong with that?&quot; You ask. He guessed her knowing one of the only other toons in existence made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, where&#39;s the gimmick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t expect every single one ...I mean, I&#39;d say her form is pretty gimmicky as is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help! My boyfriend is after me!&quot; A pale skinned blond blue-eyed woman carrying a bag of clothes with the tags still on them shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP THIEF!&quot; Another woman in a clerk&#39;s clothing outfit shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAMMIT!&quot; The shop lifter hissed and dropped her stolen good and ran harder. <br />
<br />
Tonya pull her night stick out from between her boobs and threw it, instantly catching thief between the legs who tripped and fell, in a leap she was on top of her getting her hands behind her back. &quot;Bad idea stealing on my beat!&quot;<br />
<br />
While in awe of Tonya&#39;s effectiveness as she pulled her radio out to call in the criminal, you began to paint, framing the thief.<br />
<br />
You painted the same color of the street around her, while painting her legs a solid green color, adding a yellow to the underside, being sure to add in the scale detail as you went. Her legs became one limb, morph into her tube like hip...<br />
<br />
Halfway through however, you remembered your dragon land lord... did you really want a toon criminal on the loose? How could you fix this with just images? Not having time to come up with something better, you painted in more parts of her body, including some of the tail you&#39;ve already done, making the snake flat and utterly devoid of detail, you added in the tiny arms... yellow eyes, muzzle, fangs, flicking tongue, and to give it a sense of innocence, a red bow on top of the snake like a greeting card teddy bear might have, never mind how it was held there. And you pulled away the canvas. <br />
<br />
But then... Tonya was kneeling BESIDES HER, with a paw on her shoulder as the snake girl sniffed. The bag now having a couple stuffed toys in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ssssorry!&quot; The snake girl hiccuped. &quot;The ssign ssaid &#39;free&#39;! Sso I thought the sstore was giving toys away for free!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That was &#39;buy one, get one free,&#39;&quot; said the clerk patiently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t ssend me to jail! I don&#39;t wanna missss my favorite ssshow!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay dear, nobody&#39;s gonna send you to jail...just give back the toys and we can forget about this, as long as you don&#39;t do it again.&quot; Tonya said in a gentle tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promisssse!&quot; The snakeling made a girl-scout pledge pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh, so much for an early antagonist,&quot; Adria said, &quot;Who am I kidding, our draconic landlord likely IS gonna be our antagonist, you made Sara cute for a snake!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just realized giving a criminal superpowers like yours was a Bad Idea,&quot; you explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, making it all an innocent understand? Works, but don&#39;t let that one get away!&quot; She pointed at the clerk with short but fluffy brown hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; you said. And quickly began to paint, first digigrated brown paws, followed by shapely legs, and unlike the others, you instead gave her MORE of a belly, using green like her apron to give the impression, along with her gigantic dark brown breasts just barely contained within. The rest of her clothes beside her green clerk apron vanished.<br />
<br />
 Her large ringed tail lifted up behind her with each stroke. You added more with light brown cubby arms and light brown &#39;hands&#39; that were kinda like paws with padding and tiny claws. You covered her face with a light brown muzzled, with a dark brown noise. You repainted her hair to be done in a bun held in place with two sticks, and two round ears on either side, her eyes painted exceptionally large and her mouth as a little triangle, and added some leaf earrings for fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sooo, now I remember Momji now too... and here I was thinking you were painting a raccoon... but I remember she&#39;s a tanuki now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Her name tag had not in frame when you painted her, and you could guess she hadn&#39;t been Japanese before. You also noticed that her body didn&#39;t move as much when she spoke compared to the other toons in typical animal lip flap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I did three new toons in under a few minutes, I know you&#39;re satisfied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adria grinned. &quot;Alllmost for the minute... but I see one other who&#39;s in need of a real upgrade!&quot;<br />
<br />
She pointed... at a homeless man with a &#39;will work for good&#39; sign. His clothes were dirty, his face covered in wrinkles before their time, his beard a shaggy mess.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t going anywhere for a while...<br />
<br />
You set up the canvas and began to paint. First, the shoes were covered by black cloven hooves. You think for a minute then give the shapely legs that covered up his dusty brown paints a blue color. But instead of just cartoon furry flesh, you begin to paint light violet cloth over his torso with white trim around a skirt. The giant violet sphere making combined with the extremely low cut showing off more of her breasts than it did. Then was the puffy shoulder, and very large bow underneath her little blue leaf shaped  tail. Her arms became blue and slim, with little black armored fingers, now holding a painted in feather duster, the sign being painted away all together.<br />
<br />
The head being last, painted in was a delicate muzzle, large green eyes, and tiny barely visible horns, flaked by the huge ears like furry trumpets. <br />
<br />
As soon as you pulled the painting away, the deer skipped over to you, her breasts bouncing with every step! <br />
<br />
&quot;Master Jeff! Mistress Adria! I wish to say, thank you for letting me attend your walk!&quot; She said happily and obediently.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome June,&quot; the wolf grinned at the deer. &quot;You can head home now, we won&#39;t be needing more from you for now, you can fix up the apartment while we&#39;re gone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I accept this challenge with pride mistress! Master!&quot; She bowed to you and skipped back inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Okay, I was thinking that with every stroke I admit, but out of the moment, how can I afford a maid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;June LIVES to be a domestic servant. It&#39;s what she&#39;s wanted her whole life. She does all the choirs with a smile and she doesn&#39;t have to pay her part of the rent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
