<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, boy, we&#39;ve got to go to our first period classes. Mine is English. Do you remember what your first period class is, Chad?&quot; Karl asked after parking the car, and helping Chad unfasten his seat belt and open his door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir, Master Karl, sir.&quot; He said happily with his tongue hanging out.<br />
<br />
Karl sighed, and pulled out his tablet. He made a number of adjusts. Chad stared blankly, and closed his mouth, and blinked.<br />
<br />
Karl asked &quot;What is your first period class, Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad said, &quot;I&#39;ve got study hall. But usually, I just lift weights in the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re kidding?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No s-sir, uh Ma-ster Karl?&quot; Chad seemed uncertain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well go to the gym, and workout like you normally do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad just nodded. Got out of the car, and started to walk toward the gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heel boy,&quot; Karl said.<br />
<br />
Chad trotted back to Karl and assumed the heel position.  Karl laughed. Chad looked ridiculous. <br />
<br />
&quot;You forgot your bag.&quot; Karl handed Chad his pack. Adding, &quot;Now scoot. Go to the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Chad walked toward the gym, Karl shook his head. This was a mistake. He should have made Chad human on Saturday so he could debug Chad&#39;s programming before he interacted with others. Well, he had to get to class. He would just have to make the best of it.<br />
<br />
Chad headed to his locker to change for his morning workout. It felt kind of surreal as he did something as normal as taking off his clothing at his locker.  It felt weird for some reason. He held up his jockstrap. It seemed alien to him for some reason. He used to think it was his best friend. Now Karl was his best friend? No, he was Karl&#39;s best friend. Karl was his master. What happened during the last six weeks?<br />
<br />
He heard a snuffling sound. Then someone said, &quot;I smell a skanky bitch who needs to remember its place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, they didn&#39;t speak the words in English. They barked them. Chad&#39;s mind translated them to English.<br />
<br />
&quot;On all fours bitch. Now sniff my ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad swallowed hard and dropped to his hands and knees. He crawled toward the voice. It was Cesar.  What was he doing here?<br />
<br />
Chad sniffed the alpha dog&#39;s butt. Then his nose moved lower to Cesar&#39;s musky balls. Chad missed his balls. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to mount you like I did at Master Brad&#39;s place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad lowered his head in submission. Brad had been afraid that his usual alpha training dogs Brutus and Max were too big to mount Karl&#39;s tiny pug regularly.  Chad had been a bloodied mess after their first introduction, and had lost several days training while he recuperated in the kennel infirmary. <br />
<br />
The next morning, Brad decided to use one of the smaller dogs that he was training to dominate Chad. He chose Cesar.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s Swiss cheese mind was racing. Why was Cesar here at his school? It couldn&#39;t belong to another student.  Dogs weren&#39;t allowed in school, except for Coach Sinclair&#39;s hound. Cesar was no hound. Wait, last week, Chad remembered that Coach Sanchez was getting a dog, Chad told him about his brother Brad&#39;s kennels. He even gave him a brochure. Cesar had to belong to Coach Sanchez. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lick it, pussy,&quot; Cesar ordered.<br />
<br />
Karl was his master not Cesar.  Chad was human now. He shouldn&#39;t be on all fours sniffing dog butt. He stayed on all fours in a state of confusion.  Why was he afraid of a little dog? Sure when he was a 13 lb pug, Cesar could intimidate him, but now he outweighed the brute by several times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grr, you stupid, bitch? Start licking or I may just mount you raw,&quot; Cesar threatened. <br />
<br />
Chad was about to reply when Karl got caught in class using his tablet. He managed to close it, as the teacher took it away. But as he briefly fought to keep his tablet, he had hit the reset button.  Chad&#39;s dog and human memories would merge, and his body would revert to pug dog form.<br />
<br />
Chad yipped in surprise as he shrank from man to pug while staring at Cesar&#39;s ass. The smell of dominion intensified. Chad&#39;s confusion increased tenfold as his separate sometimes conflicting memories of canine and human abruptly merged. <br />
<br />
Cesar noticed the change, and seemed to think that the change was part of Chad obeying his commands. &quot;Good, now you are a more manageable size, lick!&quot; He ordered. <br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s training kicked in, while his mind jumped all over the place. His first meeting with Cesar. The day after he was bloodied by the two mastiffs at Brad&#39;s kennel mounting him, his father, Karl and Dylan came to see him in the infirmary.<br />
<br />
Chad mindlessly licked Master Cesar&#39;s balls like the good cockhound that Master Brad had trained him to be.<br />
<br />
Brad lied and said Chad had gotten into a dogfight and would spend the week in the infirmary, so he might as well be nutted because it would take thebsame time to heal anyway. Karl recorded the operation.  Dylan had arrived first, and helped Brad cleanup the mess that the little pug was. Then Karl arrived and started recording video. He got Dylan and Brad to role-play that his pug really was their transformed brother Chad.  Then explained why their brother needed his nuts removed, and why he needed obedience training to become the best dog his owner Karl could expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, bro no more chasing girls for you. You&#39;re going to be a grade A cock hound,&quot; Brad said.<br />
<br />
Dylan laughed. &quot;Did you see the way he winced when you said that, Brad? It&#39;s almost as if he understood what you said. Karl, instead of a TikTok, I think you should make a mockumentary. Our bro will totally feel humiliated when we play this at his roast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to edit that out. Try to stay in character,&quot; Karl said as he stopped filming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan, it only understands the tone of your voice. Just say something in malevolent way and pug Chad will cringe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Brad, you wanna take it from the top.  And action,&quot; Karl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, Chad , Chad,&quot; Brad scolded.<br />
<br />
Chad looked confused. Was this all a game.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more girl chasing for you, bro. Today you&#39;re getting nutted. Dad&#39;s going to cut your tiny balls off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan pitched in with viciously glee, &quot;But Chad, you can still chase bitches, just you&#39;ll be shooting blanks. But that&#39;s okay because you&#39;re new, true purpose in life is to serve Karl. When Brad&#39;s through with you, Chad, you will be Karl&#39;s best friend with benefits. Won&#39;t that be great?&quot;  He rubbed Chad&#39;s tiny pug head.<br />
<br />
Chad snapped at his hand but Dylan was too fast.<br />
<br />
Dylan continued, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t even think of biting, or maybe you won&#39;t get these prosthetic balls after all.&quot; Dylan held up the silicone balls destined to replace the testicles in the pug&#39;s scrotum.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t be needing those for a month or so,&quot; Brad said, &quot;Besides those are too big anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I thought we were nutting- I mean neutering Chad today,&quot; Karl asked while still filming. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are, but there&#39;s no reason to install those big prosthetics right away. Having an empty ball sac with lower Chad&#39;s self esteem, and make it more trainable...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s mental revelry abruptly ended when Cesar knotted inside him. His mind focused back on his surroundings.  He was a frigging pug dog with silicone balls, and he was trained to be Cesar&#39;s bitch, and Karl&#39;s obedient pet. He cringed. Cesar exploded. Hot semen filled Chad. He sniffled stifling a sob.<br />
<br />
Karl asked his teacher for his tablet back after the class ended.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can have it back at the end of the school day, Karl. Be back here before 3:30 pm.&quot;</p>
