<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Leah peruses, a sudden grumbling brings her attention to her stomach. She half wonders if she’s hungry before a startling cramp pushes a rather vocal fart out. Her face reddens deeper, thankful that she’s already been keeping her distance from other patrons enough that no one heard. She had already been feeling a heavy weight in her stomach for a while, but assumed it had more to do with stress in a new environment. When it got worse, she thought it was just cause of her accident making her feel more anxious, but now feels incredibly stupid: she needs to poop, and has for a while. Now, the feeling was overwhelming to the point of bursting. She could say the coffee she had that morning in preparation for the park probably contributed, but honestly she should’ve gone to the bathroom way sooner. The distinct feeling of needing to take dump didn’t feel any different, so…did she just ignore it? Between getting caught up in the fun of the park, and the horror of her accident, she realized to her dismay that she completely tuned it out until now. With an added level of embarrassment, she only realized after she farted, like some potty training tot. <br />
With burning cheeks, she started to make her way to the gift shop bathroom, realizing the toddler section she was in to avoid people also put her the furthest away from her salvation; she’d have to cross the whole store. It wasn’t a particularly big one, but with how desperate she felt it might as well be a mile-long trench. <br />
Of course the very next step brought with it another gut-wrenching cramp, forcing her forward to push out a little toot trifecta. She picked up her pace, realizing that slow and steady would not win her this race, and that clenching back would not help her avoid making a mess. As such, she had no defense against the next cramp that forced a true fart her ass, lengthy and loud (and very, very wet). She ignored the faces turning in her direction in her periphery, tunnel vision tuning out the sheer humiliation she felt. She was about halfway across when the first shart came, causing her to gasp and stop in place. It wasn’t loud, but she could feel something slip out. There was no way it wasn’t visible. Her pause would come to doom her, as she once again felt herself forced forward as mush started to plop out. She started to power walk forward, trying not to look like she was currently filling her pants Will walking crouched forward. Tears of humiliation built in her eyes as she felt every gross squelch exit her behind, leaving no doubt a visible bulge; the jacket might’ve covered it from view, but no doubt the sound and the smell will give her away. The pressure was getting so extreme, she realized she really only had moments before her continence failed her. It was when a log started to finally push out that she had enough of a pause to make a break for it.<br />
Finally, she crashed herself through the private bathroom door, thanking every god she could think of that it was empty. She shut the door, locked it, then immediately squatted down to push. The moment she had privacy was her body ready to let go. Loud, echoing farts filled the room along with her grunts as she pushed the log out, keenly aware that the toilet stood but a few feet away. She wanted to remove her pants and sit upon it, but every time her body let up, another cramp forced her back to grunting and squatting like an infant. The fact that she only has herself to blame for letting it get this bad made it so much worse; can she really say that Rita or Tina are wrong to treat her like an accident prone baby when she so readily ignores her own need to go to keep having fun? <br />
Eventually she feels the cramps let up enough to allow her to finally remove her pants and plant her ass on the toilet, but finds that she only has a little left. Most of her bowel movement currently occupied her very ruined pants. She feels her tears start to really flow, her emotions overwhelming her into a whimpering, blubbering mess. How many people just saw her shit herself immediately after pissing herself? <br />
She hears a light knock on the door, bringing an immediate sense of panic.<br />
“Leah? Can I come in?” To Leah’s relief it’s Rita, whispering through the door. Sniffling, she tries to stand before remembering the heavily soiled pants at her feet. She very reluctantly raises the pants back up, cringing as the mess made contact; she already pooped her pants, no sense in also being pantless. She awkwardly shuffles over to the door to unlock it, allowing Rita in before immediately closing it again. In Rita’s hand is a bag labeled with the gift shop’s logo, a toddler-sized outfit peeking out and cluing Leah in on what it might be. Rita takes one look at the teen, and upon seeing her sagging pants a loom of understanding crosses her face.<br />
“Oh, Leah.” She says with a pitying look.<br />
“I wanna go home.” Leah spits out, too worn out to even try and hide her distress. Rita just gives a sympathetic nod before lowering her bag to the floor and opening the changing station. It occurs to Leah that the private bathroom is usually meant for mother’s who need to change their young. At the very least then, she doesn’t have to feel guilty for taking it up; she can’t really deny the fact that she earned diapers. She lets out a defeated sigh before subjecting herself to her fate, allowing Rita to take the lead in cleaning her up. She tunes out for most of it, finding some solace in that Rita seemed to know what she was doing. Soon she found herself once again in the fluffy embrace of a diaper, and her ruined clothes now tied up in a bag. Now I’m just her short and a diaper, Rita silently presented her with her replacement: an incredibly infantile looking princess onesie dress. Noticing Leah’s look of horror, the woman smiled apologetically. <br />
“Sorry, it’s the only thing your size that’d cover the diaper. That, and…I figured you didn’t want to go back out there dressed as a teenager-“<br />
“It’s fine.” Leah interjected. The only saving grace that could get her out of this bathroom is the fact that she could play herself off as a toddler incredibly well, and avoid the horrid walk of shame as a teen. Regardless of her thoughts on the outfit, it would at least get her out of the park with a minimum amount of embarrassment. Putting it on herself proved to be a slight difficulty, so once again she was forced to have Rita take charge, slipping the dress over her and snapping the bottom over her bulky diaper. She even put a little tiara in her hair, much to Leah’s dismay. <br />
“Are you ready?” Rita asked softly. In all honesty, Leah wasn’t, the sheer dread of what she’ll face outside the door from a couple strangers paralyzing her. What they aren’t fooled? What if she walks out, and she’s not just the girl who shit herself, but also the girl who dresses like a baby? She glances at the pacifier that came attached to the outfit, something she tried to ignore. Before she could stop herself, she shoves it into her mouth. Rita raises a brow, but doesn’t say anything. There was only one other thing she could think of, and she was too far into this to really resist asking.<br />
“Could…could you cawwy me?” She asked, stumbling with her words through her pacifier. Rita smiles widely, and picked her up, cradling Leah in her arms. With that, Rita opened the door, and Leah shut her eyes tight. It’s so much easier to endure stares if you can’t see them. She leans tighter into Rita’s embrace, sucking her pacifier so hard she’s afraid she’ll bruise her mouth. <br />
For what it’s worth, she felt…safe in her arms, like the harshness of the world was far away. She leaned into the feeling, anything to distract her from thinking about all the judgmental stares she was getting. Soon, however, it wasn’t an act. She felt herself relax just a touch, enough that she stopped panicking. She was drifting off to sleep when she felt a growing warmth in her diaper. In her current mental state, she felt…weirdly fine about it. It almost felt…nice? To just not worry, and let her body take control? <br />
“Alright, we’re here.”<br />
Leah’s eyes snapped open, and realized they were in the parking lot right next to Rita’s car.<br />
“Did you enjoy your nap?” Rita asked, getting a scoff from the teen.<br />
“I didn’t actuwy fall asleep. I was jus twying to pway my pawt.” It only just occurred to Leah that she was still sucking on the pacifier, almost passively now, and that her words sounded far more babyish talking around it.<br />
“Huh, we’ll you certainly had me and everyone else fooled.” The aunt responded, “Ready to go home?”<br />
Leah gave a nod, glad Rita didn’t comment on the pacifier. She thought about removing it, but…honestly, it was making her feel a little better. She was a toddler to everyone else, so it wasn’t weird, and Rita wasn’t judging her for it. Really, the only person stopping her was herself, and…she had a long day. Might as well take what she can, right? That’s what she tells herself as she enters the car and straps her seatbelt.<br />
“So, despite everything that happened, how was the park.”<br />
Leah thought over it as Rita started the car, suckling noises filling the space.<br />
“It was fun,” She said finally, “Until it wasn’t.”<br />
Rita chuckled at that.<br />
“Well, I’m glad you at least had some fun. How about next time we do something a bit more…appropriate. Now that I know what to expect, I can prepare, and we can avoid anymore future incidents. What do you think?”<br />
Theresa number of implications there that doesn’t make Leah happy, but she can’t help but agree. Sucking on her pacifier, she contemplated.<br />
“Well…”</p>
