<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trying to ignore the strange, though not at all unpleasant sensations, she went into the classroom and went to the back of the room to sit down. Since it was a math class, her least favorite class, she always sat in the back of the room so that she could doze off or just scribble in her notebook without being noticed. her boyfriend, John, normally did her homework for her which was the only reason she was passing the class. He was great at math, really loved it which was amazing to her since he was one of the star players on the football team. Why he liked something as boring as math was beyond her.<br />
<br />
Today though, due to the the feelings emanating from her clit, she doubted that she would be able to get any sleep. Try as she might, she was unable to get comfortable or alleviate the sensation, her every move only made it worse. In desperation, she tried crossing her legs, which proved to be a huge mistake. The pressure sent a shiver down her spine that caused her to sit bolt upright. It felt so good, but at the same time, she knew that it should have been impossible for her to be feeling what she was.<br />
<br />
Before she could give the matter more thought or leave for the bathroom to try and see what was going on with her, the bell rang and she realized that all of the other students were already in the room. Kyle, little jerk of a nerd that he was, was sitting in the front row, looking back to leer knowingly at her. Then the teacher, Mr. Geller, cleared his throat and Kyle snapped to attention, ready to suck up to him and answer every question Mr. Geller asked.<br />
<br />
Mr. Geller began to drone on about the subject of the day's lesson, a review of trigonometry for an upcoming test. Jennifer started to tune it out until she discovered something so amazing it drove all thought of the sensations she was experiencing out of her mind. She remembered all this stuff, even though she was certain that she had never paid any attention at all for the whole semester. More than that, it was if not interesting to her, then enjoyable to recognize what Mr. Geller was talking about.<br />
<br />
For the first time ever, she found herself taking notes in class, working out the practice problems the class was given and amazing herself by actually getting the correct answers.<br />
<br />
Shocking herself even more, when Mr. Geller was going over the formulas they would need to know for the test and asked for volunteers to write some of them on the board and explain them to the class, Jennifer raised her hand to write the law of cosines out.<br />
<br />
Of herself, Mr. Geller and Kyle it was hard to tell who was more shocked, especially since he was the only other student with his hand raised.<br />
<br />
As though in a dream, Mr. Geller motioned for her to come forward, and smirking at Kyle, she wrote out both variations the formula that they had gone over in class without once hesitating.<br />
<br />
The look of shock on Kyle's face made her day, driving all thought of the curse nonsense from her mind, for that was what it was, nonsense. If it had been real she was sure that she would have met at least one victim of the curse because there was no way something like that could stay hidden, its very nature meant that there would be proof of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you memorized something,&quot; Kyle sneered, trying to recover, &quot;really impressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Geller frowned at this seeming role reversal, wondering why one of his best students was so suddenly being disruptive while his very worst student was actually answering questions. Still, he had a feeling that Kyle was right, &quot;Kyle, another outburst like that and I am going to have to send you to the principal's office, but Jennifer, do you mind explaining to the class what you just wrote out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling sadistically she nodded, &quot;Sure, no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she said 'problem', her voice cracked, causing her smile to falter for a minute as Kyle snickered, but then she recovered, &quot;It's what you use when you know the lengths of all three sides of a triangle, or if you need to figure out the third side and you already know the other two and their enclosing angles.&quot;<br />
<br />
She spoke slowly and carefully, but her voice cracked twice more during the explanation. Kyle laughed each time, but his laughs were weaker each. Then, she sketched out a series of triangles and demonstrated how to use the formula.<br />
<br />
By the time she was done, Kyle looked like he had been sucking lemons and Mr. Geller was simply thunderstruck.<br />
<br />
Kyle began to frantically scribble something in his notebook, cut Jennifer hardly noticed, because Mr. Geller chose that moment to finally find his voice again, &quot;Jennifer, I'm amazed. What did it take to finally get you serious about my class? Because I want to include in in all of my math classes from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed at his joke and shrugged, &quot;I don't know, everything just sort of clicked for me today and I realized that I can do all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she went back to her seat, Kyle thrust out his hand and pressed the piece of paper he had been furiously writing on into her hand.<br />
<br />
To his immense frustration, she simply slipped it into her pocket and spent the rest of the class listening to Mr. Geller, answering questions and taking notes. The look on Kyle's face made her decide that she had a new favorite class, if she could make him miserable just by paying attention she knew she was going to have a good time, especially after the way the creep had called her with that stupid curse nonsense and nearly scaring her witless until she came to her senses.<br />
<br />
Her breaking voice made it all click for her, she was coming down with something and when Kyle mentioned the curse she blamed what she whatever it was she was coming down with on whatever he had said would happen to her.<br />
<br />
When the bell rang, she left the class, adjusting the way her top fell across her shoulders and loosening the straps of her backpack as she went. Her next class was a study hall, so she could get away with being late. She wanted to find out what was on Kyle's note, but not give him the satisfaction of seeing her reading it so she went to the bathroom and went into one of the stalls to sit down while she read.<br />
<br />
The note was ridiculous,<br />
<br />
'You think you're so smart, but you have no idea, do you? I bet your boyfriend gave you a ride to school today and you gave him a kiss. Or maybe, flirt that you are, you let some random jock feel you up? If you've already forgotten my transform for you, just find a mirror, because you're starting to look a little scruffy.'<br />
<br />
Laughing, she crumpled the note and threw it in the toilet, but as she did so, she noticed that her arms looked a bit more hairy than she remembered them being. Her laughter died when she remembered the rest of the details of Kyle's transformation for her, that if she were to touch a guy she would turn into a hermaphrodite.<br />
<br />
She rushed out of the stall and went straight to a mirror.<br />
<br />
What she saw made her sick to her stomach.<br />
<br />
It was hardly noticeable, but once she saw it there was no ignoring it, there was a fine down of hair across her upper lip, chin and cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she gasped, her voice cracking again, &quot;This is impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she realized that what she was thinking was indeed impossible. Kyle had her so wound up that she was seeing what must have been a simple hormone imbalance as a sign of the curse. All she needed to do was drink more milk or something.<br />
<br />
Laughing at her own foolishness, she left the bathroom and made her way to study hall. John was going to be there, usually he did her math homework for her during that time, but today she was going to surprise him by doing the work herself.<br />
<br />
With thoughts of her boyfriend, the pleasurable feeling, which she had nearly forgotten during math class returned full force. She could actually feel her clit rubbing against her panties with every move she made and the temptation to masturbate to get some fun and relief was strong.</p>
