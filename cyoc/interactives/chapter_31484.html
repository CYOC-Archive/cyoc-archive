<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>The urge to expand the kingdom of the werewolves, your kingdom, remains at the forefront of your thoughts. You were consumed by it, thinking about it constantly. You wanted desperately to have packmates, but you wanted the perfect people, not any average, run of the mill, Joe schmo. Quieting your thoughts, thinking of who you could give this to, you stand right where you were in the master bedroom, as unmoving as a statue. You remind yourself that the college was the best place to find participants and that was where your focus went. Thinking only of expanding the pack through the college campus, the perfect people to start things was with the football team. The question of how do you go about it came to your mind then, questioning whether you would give it to the captain of the team and you two gang up on the others or if you would just give it to the whole team all at once. Still standing where you were, the answer came to you in an epiphany. It would work the best to just take the whole team on at once, not leaving it to another as they might botch things, or worse... hunt you down and force you to go into hiding while sealing Howlings Hall once again. That was something that could not happen and it was not a risk that you were willing to take.</br>
<br>Now that you knew it was to be the football team, the big part was getting them to Howlings Hall. Suddenly, it was as if someone turned on a bright light in your thoughts, and a smile formed on your lips. You remember that it was Halloween tonight and everyone would be throwing a party because of it. Even though it was short notice, you knew that no one would be able to pass up the chance to spend Halloween in the creepiest place around. Since you were friends with the quarterback, befriending him when you helped him pass a certain class to keep the scholarship he had, you knew that he would do anything for you. Dialing Brent on your cell phone and hitting send, the phone rings twice and the line picks up. Brent had a nice baritone voice, one which made all the girls around him swoon with every word he spoke.</br>
<br>"Hey Drew, what's up bud?"</br>
<br>"Oh not too much, just found out that I am in charge of a Halloween party at Howlings Hill and I was curious if you and the team would like to be my first guests."</br>
<br>"Well... that is definitely an intriguing offer! You know what, for you I'll do anything! A party at that creepy house would be intense! By the way, do we need to tell others or are things all set for you and what's up with your voice? You sound a little hoarse and deeper... finally hit puberty did you?"</br>
<br>"That is good to hear Brent and I am glad you can get the whole team over here." You chuckle while thinking about his puberty comment. "Yeah, I think puberty finally hit me! Hell... it hit me in a big way!"</br>
<br>"Well... good to hear bud! When do you want us to come over?"</br>
<br>"It doesn't matter really, but it would be best if you could get here as early as possible. I am considering you all to be the honorary guests at the party, so it is very important for you to arrive before everyone else does and then we can talk about your entrance into the party when things are full throttle."</br>
<br>"Thanks, we will be there within the hour!"</br>
<br>You hang up, then walk over to the closet and grab something that would fit your new body better. You grab a dark red plaid shirt, a pair of jeans and throw slip into your slippers. Leaving the room, you head down to the main room where the pedestal and book was. Thinking that there could be something in the book to help with decoration, you flip through it, reading things as quickly as possible. As you thought, regardless of how the house looked, it was still imbued with power to create anything you needed, whether it be more rooms in the house or the simplest of things required for day-to-day living. Closing your eyes, you envision the house being creepier than it was now and decorated perfectly for a Halloween party. Upon opening your eyes you see that things were darker, candles lit all around the room, illuminating the room slightly. Along with the area being darker, eerie music played at a whisper, barely being audible. A low, thick and ominous fog hovered just above the floor, covering it completely and it added a sense of impending doom.</br>
<br>Before you knew it, time flew by quickly and the hour passed. Thinking that Brent might have went somewhere else, forgot or got tied up in something else, a loud and ominous howl traveled throughout the house. A smile spread across your lips, knowing that they arrived and soon it would be all of you howling in delight, celebrating the expansion of the clan as well as the freedom that came in being a werewolf. The howl came again, somewhat close to the last one and you looked for the main door, as it changed when the house did. Walking to the front of the stairs, you open the large double doors, which were thankfully the correct ones leading to the outside world as well as allowing the football team entrance. Brent stood at the head of the team, being the leader that he was, and smiled as he saw you.</br>
<br>"Damn Drew, you weren't kidding about puberty hitting you! You look like a new man and much older."</br>
<br>"Yeah I know, I look like I am thirty-five and thanks... I guess."</br>
<br>Brent pats you on the back as he walked into the main room. "Don't mention it bud! Wow, this place is creepier than we thought! This party is going to be awesome! So... when does everyone else arrive?"</br>
<br>"Oh... not for another couple of hours. Figured it would be better to start things when it was dark outside, you know to add to the creepiness of this place."</br>
<br>"Yeah I bet! So how did you land this place for tonight's festivities?"</br>
<br>"Well, you know that was easy. Apparently this place has been in my family for hundreds of years and I just found out about it today. Some uncle of mine had the deed to the place, which I got in the mail yesterday, especially since I was his sole beneficiary."</br>
<br>"Wow bro, super cool! Can we come in now or do you want your guests of honor to stand outside all night?"</br>
<br>"Yeah, yeah sure! Come on in and make yourselves at home!"</br>
<br>As you finish your statement, you direct with your arms for everyone else to enter. As the football team entered the room you could hear them mumble under their breath between each other, commenting on how creepy the place was on the inside compared to the outside, or the rumors they heard about the place and what went on there on occasion. As the guys walked by, you smiled evilly inward, watching each muscled body walk across the threshold as they were for the very last time. You were very happy with yourself for picking them, knowing that they would make fine additions to your family. Everyone walked around the main floor slowly, checking everything out and enjoying the eeriness the house emanated. They made themselves comfortable quickly, lounging around and talking in small groups while sitting on the old, but comfortable furniture. Brent walks over to you with a huge smile on his face, impressed with the place.</br>
<br>"This place is even better than I had imagined it! I just can't get over how creepy it is here and to think people actually lived here!"</br>
<br>"Yeah I know, it amazes me sometimes too. So are you and the guys thirsty at all?"</br>
<br>Hearing that they were being talked about, things quieted down and you ask again. Everyone nods their heads and return to their individual conversations. You then look at Brent, silently inquiring once more if he was as well.</br>
<br>"I guess you pretty much read everyone's minds huh? I too would like something as my throat feels a bit dry."</br>
<br>You nod and walk away from him, walking to another room on that level, which was devoid of refreshments, but they didn't know that. Thinking about something for everyone to drink, a huge glass bowl appeared on a cart that materialized at the same time. The bowl was ornately decorated in a scene where men were transforming into werewolves. The bowl was filled with a thick, white drink that smelled like pina colada. Knowing that this was the perfect drink to turn everyone, you unzip your fly and pull out your massive cock, that was already oozing a huge amount of pre, coating your huge mushroom cockhead. You jack your cock slowly at first to build the load and speed up until you were jacking furiously, unloading a gallon of cum into the drink. Smiling, you dunk your cock in the drink and use it as a stirring stick, just to be sure every last bit could be and was added. Cleaning yourself off, you stick your cock back in it's temporary confines, zipping up and then you walked out pushing the cart and exlir into the main room where everyone was still. Seeing the bowl, everyone got up and rushed to it, waiting for their chance at something to drink. Before you could serve them any of it, you bend down and grab the Styrofoam cups under the top tray. You pour the first glass, filling it to the top and and it to Brent.</br>
<br>"Thank you man, that was nice of you and you know you didn't have to pour that for me ya' know?"</br>
<br>"Yeah I know, but I wanted you to be the first to have a drink After all, you are the bigger guest of honor than everyone else. You are my friend and that is what friends do for one another."</br>
<br>Brent just nods, raising the cup to you and takes a sip, just to see if he liked how it tasted. After the first sip, his eyebrow raised, trying to figure out what was in it.</br>
<br>"Well... I know that there is pina colada mix in this, especially with the hint of coconut, yet there is something else I can't quite put my finger on. It's sweet while at the same time slightly bitter... oh well I am gonna drink it anyway cause it really is delicious!"</br>
<br>Relieved that your plan was going to work after all, not being botched right that moment. As Brent finished his glass, everyone else took cups and filled them as full as Brent's was, drinking slowly at first and finished before they sat back down again. Time passed by slightly as everyone was talking, no one even noticing the differences in their appearance. Everyone looked tighter in their once loose fitting clothes, so much tighter that the seams and buttons were straining to remain attached. Everyone also became covered in hair where they were smooth moments ago. You look toward Brent who was still standing next to you, just looking over the room and all his buddies, not noticing that they were all changing, as if things had always been the way they were then, and see that things were slightly further along in the change than the rest. One reason was because he had the first cup and finished before everyone else. Another reason was because you took the assurance of a bigger change in him, scooping up the drink along with the added cum that sank to one particular spot.</br>
<br>Where his face had once been cleanly shaved moments ago, he already sported a thick, one inch brown beard. His eyes had yellowed, his ears grew pointed already, his crotch was tenting and increasing in size, his fingernails lengthened slightly into claws and when he smiled, you saw that both sets of k-9s lengthened into fangs. Still watching him, his muscles increased twice as much as everyone else, pushing the fabric past it's limits, shredding at the seams and all of his clothes laid in a clump on the floor beneath his still shooed feet. Annoyed with his clothes not withstanding his size, Brent steps out of them and stands closer to you in just his gray boxers. You watched as hair sprouted over his body in all the right places, making him look like the man he was inside. As you continue watching his changes, you notice his cock had tented and was poking out of the boxer hole. He was a good even inches cut with a girth of six inches around, complete with an equally sized mushroom cockhead and it was increasing. Brent began panting, feeling heat sweep across him, signifying his changes were happening quickly. Out of nowhere, talons burst from his hands and feet as they formed into paws, much thicker and meatier than his human hands and feet. You chuckle seeing his wolf feet and claws sticking out of the shredded shoes. More muscle slipped onto his body where large mounds of muscle had already been. The hair on his body grew thicker, more coarse, changing into fur. His face pushed out forming a wolven muzzle with fangs, tongue and snout to match, while his ears moved to the top of his head. Brent twitched slightly as his balls ballooned to the size of baseballs, while his cock reached a filling nine inches in length, nine inches in girth and a cockhead just as big and juicy to match. As his transformation slowed, his tail jutted from below his butt and his cock leaked enough precum to form a large puddle on the floor beneath him. Once he finished, Brent threw his head back in a heat of wolven glory, howling long and hard. As Brent howled, his teammates finished their changes and joined in as a symphony of howls, signifying their unity as not just a team anymore, but a pack.</br>
<br>You smile wide, unable to help feeling as pleased as you were with how things turned out. All around you stood massive werewolves, with massive and throbbing cocks sticking out freely and proud. They are all part of your pack now and you were their Alpha. Smiling again, you undo your clothes and step out of the pile, proudly exhibiting all of your manliness. Your breathing becomes ragged as you force a growl from deep within your belly. Claws, fur and fangs form and you are soon among your brothers in your clan's wolven glory. Now in your wolf form, all of your packmates draw close to you, kneeling as they reached their desired distance, all showing their allegiance to their alpha. You look at Brent who was closest to you and motion for him to rise. As he did as you commanded, he looked directly at your, his gaze was unwavering. When he was on his feet, you smile a fiendish wolven smile and he returns it. When you both look into each others' very being, each of you knew what the other desired. Brent looks down at your dripping cock, licks his chops and looks back at you, waiting for authority from his alpha. You stand there motionless, as unwavering as a statue, wanting to know how long he would wait, testing his will toward you... his alpha. Brent, still unmoving, waits for your response and direction. You...</br></p>
