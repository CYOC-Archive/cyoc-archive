<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“... You will transform into a super stud of some kind!” Kylie announced.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jennifer responded. “That doesn’t sound as bad as I thought it would be.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, just wait, Justin,” Kylie said ominously before hanging up.<br />
<br />
This causes Jennifer’s overconfidence to shift into anxiety. At first, the type of man wasn’t that bad, but then three things triggered her mind to go into nervousness. First, there was “just wait.” What did Kylie mean by that? Would her mind be altered as well? Second, there was her being called Justin. Was that going to be her new name? If so, would there be some way that everyone around her would forget there ever was a Jennifer in the first place? Finally, this was about Kylie hanging up on her. It was so sudden that she couldn’t even bring up another question to spit out. That made things more intimidating than they already were. After trying to brush those thoughts outside, Jennifer started to feel intense pressure throughout her entire body.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe this had to happen on a school morning,” Jennifer muttered to herself while nervously taking off her shoes, bra, and skirt.<br />
<br />
Once she was completely naked, the changes began to take effect. Jennifer looked at her breasts, and she was shocked to see them slowly deflating. They went from a C-cup to B. That wasn’t all: her butt and thighs lost most of their fat, resulting in toned legs. On top of that, her legs helped her height grow from 5’2” to 5’9,” and her hair had shortened to a bob haircut. By then, her boobs were now an A-cup.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit,” Jennifer said, “this is bad! If I go to school like this, how are the boys going to–”<br />
<br />
Jennifer covered her mouth and realized that the changes weren’t over, far from it. The piece of evidence that supported this was when her nipples began shrinking with her breasts. Eventually, they lost their remaining fat, and it left Jennifer exactly as flat-chested as when she was eleven. If that wasn’t enough, her hips painfully started to narrow, and then her clit began to bulge.<br />
<br />
Jennifer bent her head down and found out that her clitoris had already grown an inch. Not only that, but she noticed that her pubic hair had thickened on both above and on her sagging labia. It was only a matter of time before it turned into Jennifer’s scrotum, and by that point, her clit was now thrice the size it was before. Whereas her bladder shifted around to become her prostate gland, her vagina sealed itself along with her cervix, which had also moved up inside her. When her fallopian tubes and uterus disappeared, her ovaries plummeted to fill up both of her testicles while converting themselves into testes. After that, Jennifer’s clit tripled in size again as more and more foreskin wrapped around it before letting a head burst out at the end, concluding his nine-inch cock’s development.<br />
<br />
“What in the world?” Jennifer commented. “First, I had to turn into a skinny skank, and now this?”<br />
<br />
Little did Jennifer know that testosterone was starting to pump throughout his new body. The first instance was when his neck rearranged itself by thickening to make sure that his Adam’s apple was accommodated to that.<br />
<br />
“Did Kylie plan on the changes being like this?” Jennifer questioned himself, but he realized that his voice was a lot deeper than it ever was. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me!”<br />
<br />
As Jennifer continued to watch in horror, his face started to twist and turn. His hair receded even further than it already had, making it form into a side-part comb over. The opposite happened on his lips and chin when a five-o’clock shadow sprouted around them. Speaking of Jennifer’s lips, they had thinned while his chin projected itself with his nose and forehead. Jennifer’s eyes and eyelashes shrank down, with the former getting into a more ovular form, all the while his eyebrows thickened.<br />
<br />
Jennifer glanced at his biceps. Both of them received muscle as his arms and legs redistributed themselves, consequently also giving them more muscle. Once his nails completely shrank down, Jennifer’s hands and feet became increasingly meaty. His shoulders broadened while his hips did the antithesis. Hair had additionally spread all over Jennifer’s stretched legs and arms, making his height go a few extra inches until he was exactly six feet tall.<br />
<br />
His hips, by now, were now able to be considered skinny, and they ended up terminating his once lingering hourglass figure. It was now time for the muscle to kick in his torso, so Jennifer’s chest began growing broad pectorals instead of tits. His nipples had darkened during that process. A trail of hair sprouted below Jennifer’s belly button, and it connected to his pubic hair. Now what kind of stud would go a day without a set of abs? A series of pops erupted from Jennifer’s stomach, and although somewhat painful, they helped him gain a six-pack stomach. That seemingly concluded the changes. Jennifer waited for a whole minute to make sure they stopped. Not a single one came for him. He let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thank God,” Justin said. “I thought I was going to lose my original identity, but I got to admit that I look kind of hot now.”<br />
<br />
Justin’s ease rapidly subsided when he looked at the clock.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” Justin yelled. “I’m going to be late! I better find some clothes quickly before the bus leaves.”<br />
<br />
Justin rushed toward his closet to find some male clothes that suited him. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find a single one.<br />
<br />
“Great, just great,” Justin grumbled. “I have no choice but to go in my regular ones.”<br />
<br />
Justin got his original clothes, and he took one of the other panties to replace his intended one and got his pair of tennis shoes. There was no need for a bra, of course.<br />
<br />
“This is so embarrassing,” Justin complained, “But right now, it’s either show up like this or be late for school.”<br />
<br />
Justin ran as fast as he could to make it to the bus, and luckily for him, he made it just in time.<br />
<br />
“Phew,” Justin sighed. “Hopefully, nobody will go see me like this.”<br />
<br />
Thus Justin stepped inside the bus and made it to his seat. Immediately afterward, the bus leaves the bus stop with the driver taking it to school.</p>
