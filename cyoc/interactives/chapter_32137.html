<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning sunlight began to rise up as the neighborhood was welcomed to enjoy a new day.  But in one of the houses, things are going to change for better of worse.  Inside the room, Tammy the cat, who used to have been a human and male, was sleeping peacefully in her basket bed in the living room.  When the sun peeked through the windows and Tammy, she slowly stirred and opens her cat-like eyes.  When she knew it was morning already, she up of bed and stretched her front and back legs, flexing her claws and swinging her tail left to right.  She then looked around the living room to familiarize herself with her surroundings.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Tammy felt her stomach rumbling, meaning that she needs to eat some breakfast.  She knew she hadn’t eaten anything since getting into trouble for spilling the milk and drinking from it.  So she got out of bed and approached the dish next to it to get some food.  But when she approached the dish, there was no food what so ever in it.  She mewed in sadness when she saw the empty dish and didn’t want to starve to death.  So she decided to find her masters and tell them she wants some food.  And she knows where they would be every morning.<br />
<br />
Tammy left her resting area and went up the stairs with all four of her paws to get to her masters.  When she reached the second floor, she headed to the door that leads into the master’s bedroom.  Lucky for Tammy, the door was opened slightly, so she squeezed her way in and entered the bedroom.  She looked up at the huge bed, knowing the two could be up there.  So she positioned herself, and used her cat like reflexes the jump up to the bed.  When she succeeded, she walked on the sheets and climbed on a couple of hills, which were actually human beings underneath the sheets.  When she was up the middle of the bed, she finally saw her masters.<br />
<br />
Sleeping on the bed were both Crystal and Travis, both sleeping peacefully on the bed after a long night of sex.  They were both sleeping peacefully in their bed, dreaming sweet yet desirable dreams.  But what none of them, even the cat, was that they were different.  Crystal was use to be a cute little five-year-old girl, Travis was once a woman named Tracey, and Tammy was a male human being called Tom.  But that all changed when Crystal used the EX-Treme Reality program, thinking it was a cool game.  But this game could actually change reality around the person who uses it.  Crystal started to change the gender of what use to be her parents.  Then she turned Tammy into a real life cat.  Then when she made herself older, she forgot about the program and became the new wife for Travis.  And the strangest part was that not only their bodies changed, their minds altered as well, making them adjust to their realities.  So everything around them would be the same even after they transformed.<br />
<br />
Back to the subject, Tammy stood up with her paws still on top of her masters and mewed them to wake up.  After a couple of tries, Travis started to stir and opened her eyes to see the cat on top of them.  Knowing what she wants, he looked at his wife that was still sleeping and woke her up.  “Crystal, honey, wake up…” he said to her as his wife started to stir as well.  When she opened her eyes, she saw her tired husband and said, “What?”  “It’s time to get up Crys.” her husband said, “Tammy needs her breakfast.”  Crystal lifted her head up and noticed Tammy still on the bed and on top of her.  “Oh yeah that.” She said as she lifted her hand up and gestured her to go away.  “Tammy, dear, I’ll get your breakfast ready.  Just be a good cat and wait downstairs please.  I’ll be up in five minutes.”<br />
<br />
Tammy understood her master’s request and was about to leave.  But when she turned her head, she spotted something glowing on the desk.  So she jumped off the bed and landed on her feet.  But then she jumped up on the chair and then on the desk to see the bright computer screen glowing in front of her face.  As she got a closer look at the screen, her paws were hitting the keys on the keyboard.  Crystal slowly got up and looked at Tammy staring at the computer screen very close.  “Tammy!” she screamed out, “Don’t touch that computer!  Get off of there right now before you damage it!”  Tammy obeyed that order and ran on the keys and left the computer, but not before her hind paw it on the mouse clicker.  She then jumped off the desk and exited through the door.<br />
<br />
When Tammy left the bedroom, Crystal plummet down back to the bed and sighed.  Travis then looked at her wife and said, “Now you know why Tammy’s a disaster waiting to happen.”  Crystal look at her husband and said, “Oh, Tammy’s just a little curious that’s all.  She doesn’t really mean to do much harm.”  “Yeah, well if your cat gave your computer a virus, don’t blame me when it crashes.” Travis retorted back as he turned his head away.<br />
<br />
The two were silent for the next minute until Travis looked back at her wife and asked, “So…  Are you going to feed the cat now.”  Crystal thought about it and came up with an idea.  So she looked at him with a devilish smirk and said, “I will.  But before I do, can I have one more round?”  Travis looked at her with a confused look and said, “Are you serious?  We already get it on last night.  Do you really want to go at it again so early in the morning?”  “Of course silly.” answered Crystal, “It will make me feel wide awake.  So, do you want to do it?”  Travis thought of it for a moment and decided to make out anyways.  After all, the last thing he wants is an angry wife in need of some sex.  So to answer her question, by giving her a passionate kiss.  Crystal then deepened the kiss and within seconds, they went into a second round of hot sex in the morning.<br />
<br />
While the two were making out so early, they didn’t know the program on the computer was acting up.  When Tammy was watching the screen out of curiosity, she constantly pressed the keys with her paws, creating an error on the game.  It then started to randomly select anyone in or out of the house and deciding what to change whoever it picks into.  Who did it pick and what is it changing the subject into?</p>
