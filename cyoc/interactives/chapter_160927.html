<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the hundredth time, Danielle cursed her parents moving to Oak Falls. It was nowhere; old growth forests, hills, streams, and a little cluster of stores where the interstate passed through.<br />
<br />
They had moved abruptly, chasing the dictates of her mother&#39;s job as the had several times before. <br />
<br />
Danielle was 19, and an awkward only child. She kept her hair dyed black and buzzed to an inch length. Born with a aggressive personality and a slow metabolism, she tried to overcome her short stature (barely five feet tall) and tendency towards plumpness with weight lifting. Years of weights and an inability to resist ice cream had her at 160 pounds, noticeable biceps, and thick powerfully muscled legs. She still had a bit of a belly and F cup tits that drew the eyes of every guy she met. In high school she had often been called a shortstack, and it fit.<br />
<br />
She was an unsettled teen, years of moving and being an only child had stunted her social skills. Her eyes were a light gray, and many found her gaze unsettling. Meeting her gaze was a challenge as the humorless but brilliant mind behind it was readily apparent.<br />
<br />
The only bright spot to moving to nowhere was being able to volunteer at the big cat sanctuary. She was desperate to prove herself and convert her summer internship into a full-time job, rather than attending MIT in the fall. Danielle was fascinated by the great cats of the world, her childhood plushies were all felines of one kind or another. She loved their grace and power, not to mention their beauty.<br />
<br />
The Sanctuary was heaven for her. 1500 acres of forest divided up into separate habitats for over 100 animals. They were also one of the foremost research centers for feline genetics and medicine.<br />
<br />
Danielle had been amazed as the Gay Pride outbreak started at her school. One of her few friends, Leah, was one of the cheer leaders that were the first infected. Danielle&#39;s was over for sleepover at Leah&#39;s house the night Leah became Leon, a seven foot tall feline Adonis. Danielle wasn&#39;t infected that night and was politely supportive as her friend turned into Danielle&#39;s idea of her perfect lover. She had been so turned on that she used maxi pads to keep her juices from soaking through her underwear.<br />
<br />
Quickly overcoming her hesitation, the next day she propositioned Leon, bluntly explaining her attraction and deep sexual need to get fucked by her transformed friend. Unfortunately Leon was just as gay as the rest of the pride, and while sexually insatiable, just couldn&#39;t get interested in making love to a girl.<br />
<br />
As more of the school changed, and she saw more naked lion studs strutting the halls, her lust built. She begged Leon, and finally after a few weeks she convinced him to try. <br />
<br />
It never would have worked without the permanent erection that came with Gay Pride. Danielle and Leon shared a bottle of rum generously provided by Leon&#39;s older brother (formerly older sister). When they were both nicely drunk, she had Leon lay down on his bed. She told him to just close his eyes and not think about who was riding him. <br />
<br />
Danielle had been practicing with a fat foot long dildo, and probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to take his girth otherwise. She was so wet, so ready, she lowered herself down on his length. His cock bottomed with inches left, her petite build just wasn&#39;t meant to take so much meat.<br />
<br />
Leaning forward, she ran her fingers through the thick fur of his chest. She could smell him, a primal masculine scent. Her fingers found his nipples and began playfully rubbing them. Her hips rolled as she began riding up and down on his shaft. She did all the work, keeping silent to not disturb whatever fantasy might be playing out in her lover&#39;s head. She didn&#39;t care who Leon was imagining was riding him cowgirl.<br />
<br />
The anticipation had her ready to go off from the beginning. She kept grinding on Leon&#39;s cock as orgasms rolled through her body. The lion under her seemed no closer as she came for the third time. Feeling bold, she lifted her legs and spun 180 on his shaft. Reaching down she found his weighty sack and began fondling his balls as she kept rhythm.<br />
<br />
Danielle squeezed down hard on the cock inside her as she came again, and she felt Leon tensing under her. The lemon sized balls in her hands pulled up tight. <br />
<br />
With a low roar Leon climaxed. The pressure was astonishing, cum spurted out around the tight seal of her sex around his shaft. <br />
<br />
Spent, she flopped over onto his chest, relishing the softness of his fur against her skin. Her friend rested one massive paw on her back.<br />
<br />
They laid together in silence, Leon&#39;s still hard shaft inside his petite lover.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t talk much as they parted. As she walked home Danielle reflected. Sex for her was never going to be the same again, Leon had ruined it for her. She would have to join the Pride. As she walked, she could feel lion jizz still oozing from her cunt. Leon might not have been that into it, but he still had stuffed her thoroughly.<br />
<br />
The following week, Leon acquired a vial of infectious cum for her, with a promise that she spend the upcoming holiday weekend with him while she changed.<br />
<br />
That was not to be, as Danielle&#39;s family abruptly uprooted her again before they could act on it.</p>
