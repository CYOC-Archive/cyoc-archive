<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry&#39;s pacing around the living room told Joan her husband was worried; he only paced when he felt powerless to act, but knew he should. The lack of an electrical outlet or a phone meant the family couldn&#39;t ring for road assistance as planned. But the larder and pantry full of fresh food told him that whomever owned this cabin wasn&#39;t too far away. Probably even back in the morning. Not wanting to get stuck there in an awkward position, she could tell a part of Henry just wanted to go. But the night was dark, almost moonless, and no sources of light were found in the cabin.<br />
<br />
Henry was anxious, but Joan, Joan felt excited, flush, giddy. This was the most exciting thing that had happened in years to her family. The cabin was a magical looking place, the rooms wonderfully decorated, especially the master bedroom. Just thinking about the paintings gave her the fuzzies. It was cozy. Even without the heating on it was warm; and Joan had her family here, her husband. He needed to relax. Joan stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey! Kids. There&#39;s nothing else to do here tonight. We&#39;ll have to just sleep for the night, going out there now would be foolish, so lets not think about it. Come on, we&#39;re wrecked. Jess, James, go upstairs and get some shut-eye. Henry, come on. We&#39;re going to bed.&quot; She reached her hand out as an offering to him.<br />
<br />
Her children moved without protest, but Henry began voicing a feeble complaint. Joan shut him down. &quot;I&#39;ll write a two notes, and pin them to the front and back door to the house. If anyone comes back they&#39;ll be forewarned and should hopefully be understanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not seeing any other choice Henry nodded and grasped his wife&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
James ascended the stairs, trudging, putting one weary foot in front of the other. Exhausted he made it to the bedroom door. He barely had time to register the layout of the room when Jess blew past him in a whirl or auburn hair. Even though she was short and skinny compared to his larger, more muscular frame, he was still knocked off balance and had to catch himself on the frame of the door.<br />
<br />
With a sour look he saw his sister buzz to a pink lacy bed and sit on the covers, turning to face him. He turned to regard the other, free, blue bed. He rolled his eyes and entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, I was hardly going to take the pink bed...&quot; He grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well... you never know, you could have taken it just to spite me!&quot; she retorted, unconvincingly. James was far to weary to entertain this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess... forget it. I&#39;m going having a shower, hopefully the water is warm.&quot; He trudged past his sister, her head swivelling to track him across the room and into the bathroom. The door shut with a *thoom* and a loud *click* told her the latch was bolted. <br />
<br />
Eyes still on the door her hand slid under the covers, to come in contact with the large phallus under the bed. It was still warm to the touch. This place was strange.<br />
<br />
She threw off her hoodie, while kicking off her jeans too. Underneath she was clad only in a thin tee and a pair of panties. No bra adorned her chest under the tee. She hadn&#39;t bothered since she had just expected to be sitting in a car all day, under a big hoodie. Not that her AA cups really needed a bra day-to-day.<br />
<br />
Her socks stayed on as Jess lifted the covers and hopped into the bed. Shifting around she scooted down and dropped to horizontal. Beside her, down the length of her side and her leg, she could feel the dildo. It felt like it was pulsing, but obviously it was just her own pulse.<br />
<br />
An eye still on the door, Jess&#39;s hand slid down to her panties. She could feel the heat and moisture from several inches away. It had been like that for the last hour. She had genuinely been worried that it would have shown through her jeans. Now finally alone she needed to fix her horniness, and fast; her brother wasn&#39;t known for super long showers. Pre-gaming she began alternating clenching her legs together and rubbing herself over her sodden panties. <br />
<br />
The squeak of a tap and the hiss of water told her when she was good to go.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time she hooked two thumbs on the waist of her panties and pulled them down past her knees. The feel of air against her exposed swollen vulva made her wince. Her long skinny fingers quickly ran past her light coating of red pubes and ran over and through her folds.<br />
<br />
For someone so skinny and with such small breasts, Jess had developed a substantial, meaty vagina. she felt dispoportionate with it, and it was one of the reasons she was so shy with boys. It demanded a terrible libido though. Ever since her flower had bloomed, and she discovered self-pleasure, Jess had been regularly partaking. At home she had her own collection of dildos, cleverly hidden in a box under a loose floorboard. This one though. This one seemed different. And she was excited to try it out.<br />
<br />
Grabbing it she hiked her knees up, bringing the long object around and aligning it with her needy hole. A few swipes of the tip across her meaty angry folds brought a tear of agony to her eye. She needed a quick fuck.<br />
<br />
Not waiting she lined up the tapered tip and began slowly pushing in. The feeling of the shaft growing in thickness at her entrance as the tip pushed deeper and deeper was exactly what she was looking for. Pulling it back almost fully out she pushed again, this time making a little squeak.<br />
<br />
A few more thrusts and she found a rhythm. As she squelched away, and the rumbling, bubbling feeling began to rise within her core she grunted in annoyance. It felt like she was lying on something, like her lower back and bum were on something. Too horny and into it to care, Jess ignored the feeling and ploughed away.<br />
<br />
A few more pumps brought her to an eye watering, toe curling orgasm as she cramped up and let out a long squeak through gritted teeth. Her stomach muscles began convulsing and her legs twitching, dildo still buried in her. Pulse after pulse blew through her as her energy ebbed and ebbed. <br />
<br />
Completely drained, Jess flopped back onto the pillow, cheeks and face burning a red to batch her hair. Mentally and physically shattered, she turned under the covers and closed her eyes on a long day, not bothering to remove the warm implement of joy, just turning to get away from whatever she was lying on.<br />
<br />
On her side as she drifted off she briefly wondered what whispy object was tickling the back of her calf; but almost completely in dreamland already she waved it off and drifted off. The first of the Millers to fall to sleep in the cabin, long tail with a bushy red-haired tip lazily flopping under the covers.</p>
