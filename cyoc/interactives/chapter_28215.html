<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a short pause.  &quot;Oh realllly?  And here I thought you would be too afraid to let <br />
anyone change your beautiful body.&quot;  Jennifer heard 'Kyle' (whoever he was) chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last time you were ever nice to me was at your ninth birthday party.  So for your <br />
transformation, you're going to become nine years old again.  Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard the phone click, as the boy on the other end hung up.  The whole incident <br />
weirded her out.  &quot;Nine years old?  That's impossible...&quot;<br />
<br />
But even as she said it, she felt very strange.  She felt hot, even feverish, and there was a <br />
painful wrenching sensation inside her body.  She felt like throwing up, so she rushed into <br />
the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Closing the door behind her, she rushed to the sink, her hands gripping the sides of it as <br />
she looked into the mirror.  She was sweating and her hair was already damp.<br />
<br />
Another sharp pain, and when she could see clearly again, a 15-year old Jennifer was <br />
staring back at her.  &quot;Oh my god, this can't be...ahhh....&quot;<br />
<br />
The pain caused her to fall to her knees, as her body shrank and contracted.  And then, <br />
blissfully, she passed out.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Some time later, she regained conciousness.  She was laying on the cold porcelain tiles of <br />
the bathroom floor.  She struggled to get up, and reached for the sink....which was much <br />
higher off the floor than before.  Managing to stand, she realized she could barely see <br />
herself in the mirror!<br />
<br />
She turned the shower, closing the door, which had a mirror attached to it, and could only <br />
stand in shock at her own reflection.  A cute girl of 9, with shoulder length, pale blonde <br />
hair (it had darkened several shades as she grew older) and green eyes looked back at her.   <br />
Her pink bra looked ridiculous, hanging loosely on her now flast chest, and her skirt <br />
slipped off her slender thighs to fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
Her view trailed down and she looked at the area between her legs.  Completely <br />
hairless....she had been totally robbed of her young womanhood.<br />
<br />
Tears came to her eyes, but she shook it off.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people thought Jennifer was your typical, attractive teenaged girl.  A little flightly, <br />
very superficial.  And very spoiled.<br />
<br />
And they'd be right, to a point.<br />
<br />
But what most people didn't know is what happened a few weeks after her ninth birthday.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
&quot;Now just stay in the car, Jenny, I'm going to run into the office real quick to get a few <br />
things.&quot;  Jennifer's mom smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Mom, it's late, can't we just go home and have dinner?&quot;  Jenny looked over at her <br />
mother.  The school play had run late, and she felt tired and hungry.  <br />
<br />
Marilyn Smith smiled at her daughter.  She looked so cute in the dress they'd made her <br />
wear for the play.  She kissed Jenny on the top of her head.  &quot;I won't be more than ten <br />
minutes, dear, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
But a few minutes later, Jenny heard the screams, and looked out the window to see a man <br />
attack her mother.  The man ripped open Marilyn's blouse, intent on raping her.<br />
<br />
Jenny couldn't do anything but scream.  Her mother struggled, and suddendly there was a <br />
gunshot, and she fell to the ground, blood pooling around her.<br />
<br />
And then the man looked right at her.  He started walking towards the car.<br />
<br />
In desperation, Jenny locked the doors, but then the man held up something.  Her <br />
mother's keys.  He opened the door and....<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he rape her?  Did he rape my daughter?&quot;  Brian Smith was a tall man, who worked out <br />
regularly.  As if being physically imposing wasn't enough, he was powerful in other ways, <br />
having recently been appointed to the post of Assistant District Attorney.  <br />
<br />
Dr. Lindsey Harker knew she was dealing with a man who could do something very rash, <br />
so she spoke in a calm, even voice.  &quot;No Mr. Smith.  He did remove her clothing, but that's <br />
when the security guard stopped the assailant.  Shots were fired, and both men are <br />
currently in critical condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And....Marilyn?&quot; It was as if all the power had been drained out of Brian's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, she died almost instantly, shot through the heart.  But you can't lose yourself in <br />
grief, Mr. Smith.  Your daughter has suffered severe emotional trauma.  Right now, she's in <br />
a fugue, she's barely responsive, or even aware of her surroundings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian nodded.  &quot;You're right...Jennifer is the most important thing right now.  What's the <br />
security guard's name?  He saved my little girl's life...and got shot in the chest for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...Mark Riley.  I'm fairly sure he'll pull through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Money is no object, Dr. Harker.  You understand?  I...I need to be alone for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
It was several months before Jennifer could go back to school.  And she had changed.  <br />
Gone was the sensitive, quiet and caring girl from before.  She'd been replaced.  Jennifer <br />
had no memory of her ordeal....on the surface.<br />
<br />
But deep inside, there was another Jennifer.  One who did remember.  Another self, <br />
created to deal with the trauma.  Completely missed by the psychologists.  And right now, <br />
she was in charge.<br />
<br />
Calmly, she picked up her clothing and headed to the laundry room, where Martha had <br />
gathered some of her old clothes, to give to charity.  Rummaging through the boxes, <br />
Jennifer found some clothing that fit reasonably well.  She put her old clothes into the <br />
wash.<br />
<br />
She remembered who Kyle Perkins was.  A year younger than her, he was a very bright <br />
young man, if somewhat socially inept.  He lived in the neighborhood, which is why he'd <br />
been invited to her birthday party.  She remembered liking him, back then.<br />
<br />
But the other her, she treated him poorly.  Typical.  Jenny didn't care much for Jennifer.  <br />
Oh she served her purpose, allowing the two of them to function socially.  But at the <br />
moment, Jenny didn't have much use for her.  This was her time.<br />
<br />
She found a pair of old sneakers and slipped them on, then made her way into her father's <br />
room.  She found the lockbox that he kept his gun in.  Her father.<br />
<br />
He was a decent man, but he hadn't been enough.  If he'd been stronger, his daughter <br />
wouldn't have ended up like this.  The combination was easy to figure out, Marilyn's <br />
birthday.  She missed her mother.  Perhaps now it was time to avenge her.<br />
<br />
She loaded the gun.  Colt, .45 caliber.  A large weapon for her now.  She experimented <br />
with a two handed grip.  It would take two fingers to pull the trigger.  Long-range <br />
accuracy would be for shit, but she didn't need much range.<br />
<br />
She placed the gun, with spare ammo, in her schoolbag.  She slung it over one <br />
shoulder...it was also a bit large for her, but it would do.<br />
<br />
Deep inside, she could hear Jennifer crying to get out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry girl, you've had 8 years to grow up.  And look how you turned out.  This is your <br />
fault.  And, as usual, I'm going to clean up your mess.  But this time, I'm not going to let <br />
you back out.  It's my turn now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her other self grew quiet.  There was no arguing about which one of them was stronger.  <br />
Jenny noted a wad of bills in the lockbox as well.  She took it.  Who knows how long she <br />
would be stuck in this body, she was going to have to take care of herself for now.  <br />
<br />
She felt no qualms about stealing from her father; he owed her a lot more than this.  Also <br />
in the lockbox were two addresses on a piece of paper.<br />
<br />
-Mark A. Riley, 922 Madison St.<br />
<br />
-Victor Hughes, 731 Carson Drive, Apartment D<br />
<br />
Uncle Mark, she knew quite well.  He'd saved her life, and took a bullet in the process.  He <br />
was a good man, and he might be able to help her.<br />
<br />
As for Victor, he'd killed her mother..and more.  It was time she did what her father was <br />
too weak to do.  Time to kill him.<br />
<br />
But first...</p>
