<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her eyes kept going back to the Previous Alterations button.  She clicked on it and saw two entries.  Both <br />
entries appeared to be a date and time entry.  Her name was under the Subject entry followed by duration.  The <br />
first entry must have been her disappearing act as its duration was roughly the 5 minutes she was invisible.  <br />
Duration for the second entry kept increasing with each second she stared at the screen.<br />
<br />
She clicked on the first entry and it immediately asked if the 'alteration' should be repeated or edited.  She <br />
could also cancel to return back to the main log page.  She took a few seconds and decided she wanted to <br />
review the settings that made her disappear.<br />
<br />
She was a little slower this time since she didn't have a boyfriend returning home to speed up her decisions.  <br />
She was intrigued when the program asked whether she wanted just parts of her body to become invisible.  When <br />
she selected in parts, she was presented with a very detailed outline of her body.  Her digital body appeared <br />
as she appeared, wearing the same clothing.  The only thing was that her arms were spread out as were her <br />
legs.  She could use a mouse and essentially outline those parts she wanted to have invisible.  She circled <br />
her head and both arms as this was a game.  With a little more reflection, she selected her whole body, just <br />
as she had before.<br />
<br />
The next question asked her about the degree of opacity she wanted to have.  She could go from just barely <br />
faded to completely transparent.  A slider allowed her to select the degree and she could see the body on the <br />
screen fade away and reappear as she slide it from one end to the other.  Again, she went for complete <br />
invisibility.  She wasn't interested in being a ghost.<br />
<br />
She paused when asked if the alteration should impact things touching her body.  Previously she had hit the <br />
default which was yes.  'There's no one to find me,' she concluded.  She selected no.  The screen immediately <br />
switched to an outline of her clothing rotating on the screen.  She gasped her legs and torso were present but <br />
no arms or head.  She decided to slip off her pumps and the screen immediately updated.  'Crazy!'<br />
<br />
Then the wizard asked how quickly the transformation should take place.  The previous change was instantaneous <br />
but she could slow it down to years she discovered.  Since the change was going to be 30 minutes, it was <br />
recommended that this be the longest time to undergo the alteration.  Megan decided she would 'fade-away' over <br />
a minute of time.  She wasn't sure what to expect.  Fortunately, she was alone so it really didn't matter.  <br />
She didn't have to instantly disappear.  The program noted the duration of the alteration began when the <br />
transformation started.<br />
<br />
She set the alteration rate and was then prompted by the duration for the transformation.  She shuttered when <br />
it offered her permanent invisibility.  She had seen enough horror movies and comedies of invisible people.  <br />
She wasn't ready to disappear, either  She just wanted to experiment.  She decided 30 minutes would be a <br />
sufficient if for some reason she didn't end this change earlier.<br />
<br />
Megan was amazed when yet another question popped up.  'How long to delay alteration?'  She looked around, <br />
wondering if she was ready to disappear.  She looked out the window toward the windows of other apartment <br />
complexes.  A few lights were visible and once and awhile someone walked by the opening.  She decided to give <br />
herself a minute to shut the blinds before she disappeared.  As with the rate, she could have it start as soon <br />
as she wanted or years in the future.  <br />
<br />
She clicked next and the program asked her if she wanted to save the wizard's configuration for the future.  <br />
Megan liked how user friendly the program was and confirmed she wanted to save it.  She entitled it 'Invis1' <br />
and saved it.  She was then prompted whether to begin the alteration or return to the main menu.  &quot;Finally,&quot; <br />
she said.  She was amazed how detailed the wizard was.  She had little hesitation to click the Begin button.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the emitter flashed blue and engulfed her briefly.  When she recovered from the flash, she realized <br />
nothing had happened.  The screen showed a countdown of 50 seconds to transformation initialization.  She had <br />
not expected the flash and realized she had enough time to get to the drapes.  She walked over to the drapes <br />
and began pulling the string, drawing the window closed.  Her laptop beeped which startled her.<br />
<br />
A tingling sensation began flow through her toes, her fingers, her arms, her legs, and her torso.  For a <br />
moment, her head was swimming as her entire body at once flooded her mind with a mixture of utter pleasure and <br />
the numbing of loss of blood flow.  She didn't feel like she was going to stumble but it took some effort to <br />
walk back to the computer.  <br />
When she reached it, transformation initiated, 42 seconds till completed. She quickly looked at her arm.  Sure <br />
enough, she could see it was somewhat translucent.  She could see the table underneath it.  She held up both <br />
arms and marveled as they steadily became fainter.  It was odd that there was no distortion or refraction of <br />
items underneath her arms.  <br />
<br />
She got up and ran to her bedroom, turning on the lights to look at herself in the full length mirror.  She <br />
could see the reflection of the room through her head and arms.  She saw her jeans were floating above the <br />
floor and a depression was left in the carpet where she stood.  &quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood before the mirror and the only thing visible was the room behind her and her clothing which was <br />
showing a little animation as she breathed and adjusted her balance.  She pulled her shirt forward to confirm <br />
that there wasn't anything inside but her bra and panties.  &quot;It really worked,&quot; she told herself.  She had <br />
made herself invisible again.  <br />
<br />
All the sensations that had flooded her mind had waned and she felt quite normal despite lacking any <br />
observable flesh.  She wiggled her toes and ran her left hand over her right arm.  Her body was not visible <br />
although the clothing provided the only real evidence of her existence.</p>
