<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yeah, my friend here got inflated by one of the shower heads, and now he&#39;s all...&quot; at a loss for words, Tony instead pushes his hand into an unwilling but helpless Chris, to display his point. The new boy watches with interest as Chris gently gyrates. He shuts his eyes tight and blushes, awaiting the sensations to cease. Even after they do, he feels a different set of hands explore his turgid form, lingering a little too long over the rosy remnant of a nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re telling me this thing is a person!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not a thing, he&#39;s my friend, and he needs help! I just don&#39;t know how to get all of the water out to deflate him.&quot; Tony explains. He felt bad doing so, but was hoping to appeal to the sympathies of this new, younger, and hopefully ignorant boy. It was quick thinking on his part, and he figures that if the boy was dumb enough to be reduced to a living water balloon while trying to help someone, someone on *Pleasure Island*, well maybe he kind of deserved a lesson. <br />
<br />
The boy looks back up to Chris in wonderment, and slight disgust. <br />
<br />
&quot;H-have you tried poking him? With something sharp, like a tack or pin?&quot; he offers shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but what if he just bursts instead of deflating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you could try to pump it out of him, or finding a hose and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His mouth is sealed shut.&quot; Tony interrupts, a little bit of blood rushing to his face as he recalls the moment just before the boy arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...any other, uh. &#39;Openings&#39;?&quot; The boy seems so much smaller when he talks. He&#39;s already a bit short, a bit skinny, but his slight voice and manner of speaking lead Tony to question his age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Other openings? Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uh, you know? Maybe his nose,&quot; the boy reaches up on his tip toes and tries to tap a finger towards Chris&#39;s distended and now flaring nostrils. He accidentally pokes a finger into one, momentarily distorting it further, and pulls backs in an instant. &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; he mumbles. &quot;His ears, his belly button?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think his belly button is actually a hole, and the shower head entered through his mouth, so it probably filled his stomach up. His ears wouldn&#39;t help, and I don&#39;t think his nose would either. They&#39;re too small, anyways.&quot; Tony could think of two other options, but he really didn&#39;t want to discuss them, let alone venture there. He knows Chris wouldn&#39;t appreciate it, and really, Tony isn&#39;t sure if he was that desperate. Yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. His belly filled up, huh?&quot; The boy gives an experimental jab, Chris gives a shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t poke him like that, he&#39;s got it bad enough as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I have an idea. Earlier, right before you walked in, I was able to force, my, uh, finger into Chris.&quot; The boy looked at Tony strangely. &quot;His mouth.&quot; Tony quickly adds. He nods in understanding. &quot;I think that if we can get something into his mouth, it might work. But it won&#39;t be easy. If you wouldn&#39;t mind staying here with him, I&#39;ll go out and look for some sort of hose or tube or pipe or something. Then, one of us will get a...uh, a sort of sucking motion going, to start the flow, you know?&quot; The boy nods again, Tony continues, &quot;So we get the water started off, and the stronger of us will be able to pry the mouth open and shove the tube in. Everything will shoot out of Chris here,&quot; Tony gives his big friend another amicable but misguided pat, sending him into another fit of wobbles, sloshes, and squeals, &quot;because he&#39;s under immense pressure, and then voila! He deflates.&quot; Tony finishes proudly. He sees no flaw in his plan, and neither does the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so how do we start sucking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no offense, but I think I might be able to push a little bit harder than you. So I was hoping that while I went to go find something to put into Chris, you might get a head start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but how-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since it&#39;s his *mouth* we&#39;ll be working on, maybe you could, uh. Suck it. With your mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy eyes nearly pop from his head. He looses the little color he had, then quickly flushes beet red. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh. I- I&#39;ve never, um. Kissed anyone before.&quot; he stammers, averting eye contact with Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t look at it like a kiss. You&#39;ll be helping someone out. Plus, I doubt this will actually count as that; you didn&#39;t even know Chris was alive until I showed you he was just a little bloated. Besides, I&#39;ve known him since we were in diapers. If I were to do it, it might actually be a bit weird for the both of us. But you two have never met, so nothing&#39;s weird at all!&quot; Tony shoves the smaller boy forward, causing him to crash into the giant, plush face before him. Chris, formerly a nice pastel peach, is now nothing but a big, fat ball of rosy pink. His nipples, crotch, anus, and lips are indistinguishable from his blush. Just as Tony nods and turns to leave, the boy kneels down with pursed lips, aimed for his own. Chris peeps for Tony, but his friend is out of ear shot. The boy looks up to his eyes with shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I have to do this.&quot; he bows his blonde little head and meets Chris&#39;s lips. It&#39;s a struggle to force them into a part; the boy pushes his hands into the crease he creates, and dives further and further until he realizes how deep he is. His face is covered by hot, soft lip and saliva. His hands are in up to his wrists. He pulls them out. The open space falls back with a slap as Chris&#39;s heavy lips meet together. They boy&#39;s face is still stuck, however, and just as he believes to be running out of oxygen, he finds an opening. Unfortunately, it&#39;s filled with water under very high pressure. The boy&#39;s pale lips part and his once tiny and delicate face begins to bulge outwards. Chris feels the shift in himself, he feels the growing bladder still squished in between his lips. Any screams the boy had were silenced by the rush of water into his own body. His head and neck and shoulders merge into one. They&#39;re fat and heavy but malleable, and succumb to the pressure of Chris&#39;s closed mouth. They flatten out into a thick pancake as more water pours past them and into the child&#39;s stomach and crotch. The two quickly merge and hit the concrete floors with a splash. The resounding displacement shakes both the now pudgy, balloonish, sagging boy (still half-emerged inside a warm, watery prison), and the now rapidly deflating Chris.</p>
