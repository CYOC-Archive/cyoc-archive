<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty raised his arms over his head as debris rained down around him, splashing in the two-foot deep pool of cum that filled the bathroom. He waded through the thick liquid towards Julie. She was plastered to the wall and absolutely coated with Keith’s spunk, her features all but hidden behind the thick layer of dripping white. “Julie! Are you all right??” Ty gasped. He hadn’t had a chance to test whether his powers could reverse injury, and he hoped this wouldn’t be his first time trying. To his relief, the girl slumped to the ground with a wet slurp as she peeled off the wall, and nodded weakly. Satisfied with the response, Ty quickly turned his attention back to Keith. He looked about fifteen feet tall by now and towered above them, flexing his titanic arms and kissing his biceps. “YES, GOD YES,” he boomed. “SO HUGE, SO FUCKING SEXY...”<br />
Ty tried to think quickly, formulating a wish to turn Keith back to normal, but Keith took a step forward, his giant foot flinging Ty against a wall. The slender teen was knocked out cold.<br />
“JUST LOOK AT ME,” Keith continued, completely ignorant of the two below. The bathroom walls crumbled before him as he casually walked forward, complete attention focused on himself. “I’M SOOO BIG NOW. FUCKING HUGE. FUCKING BUFF!!!” He struck a pose to punctuate his showboating, and muscles all over his body swelled obscenely.<br />
Students and faculty came flooding out of their classrooms, some stopping to gawk as some ran for the hills. “FUCK RIGHT,” Keith laughed. “COME LOOK AT THE MUSCLE FREAK. YEAH. FUCKING SEX GOD.” He kept up his posing routine, every flex raising his arousal, and his arousal in turn causing him to grow even further. Keith was rapidly approaching a width equal to his height, twenty feet at least of mountainous teen beef. With a particularly lewd hip thrust, he sent his cock bursting through the wall of the classroom Ty had left minutes earlier, pinning Mrs. Richardson to the blackboard with his mammoth cocktip.<br />
Dustin managed to push her way through the growing crowd of onlookers, annoyed as more than one pair of hands groped at her tits and ass as she passed by. “Damn it Ty, what did you do...” she whispered to herself, then stopped short with a girlish squeak as she spotted the muscle titan that was filling the sky above the school. Keith was so massive that from ground level, Dustin couldn’t even see his face behind his blimplike pecs. His lats were spread triumphantly, wide enough to park a several trucks on, and his thighs wrestled for space underneath him even in the odd squatting position he had taken. Dustin squinted up at the bloated shape, wondering why it was simply bobbing in place. The she spotted it as her eyes lingered on his ludicrously shredded abs, what should have been an enormous cock jutting into the sky was missing from the picture—Keith was fucking the hole he’d punched in the wall of the classroom. Dustin awkwardly made her way back into the building, only stopping to gawk at how many of the onlookers had disposed of their pants and were now masterbating freely at the sight of what used to be their football captain.<br />
Dustin burst through the door of the now-abandoned classroom, and saw exactly what she expected. Keith’s overgrown cock was spanning the entire length of the room, and was furiously grinding itself against the opposite wall. Poking out from underneath the swollen tip was a pair of arms and legs, Mrs. Richardson’s body almost hidden almost completely from sight behind it. She was pinned five feet from the ground, her body being shoved up and down the blackboard. She shouted out in time with each thrust, it looked like there was enough pre gushing from Keith’s manhood lubricating her body to keep her from getting hurt. Acting quickly, Dustin jumped forward to free her, careful to dodge the chairs and debris the roughly bucking penis knocked her way. “Where the hell is Ty?!” Dustin groaned aloud as she climbed Mrs. Richardson’s upturned desk to reach her.<br />
Dustin could see the teacher’s face now, mouth agape in a look of perpetual surprise. Her blouse had been pushed up over her bust by the constant pressure of Keith’s cock, his bulging tip lifting her exposed tits lewdly with each thrust. Dustin thought for a split second how much Keith would have enjoyed this sight if he even knew the hottest teacher in school was stuck under the very tip of his erection. “Mrs. Richardson! I’m gonna get you out of here!” Dustin shouted. She didn’t respond, her wide eyes fixed on the bus-sized phallus in front of her. Dustin reached out to catch her hand, but couldn’t reach her as she bounced wildly. There was only one way to pull her loose, it seemed.<br />
Dustin leapt from the desk and smacked against the side of Keith’s dick. It was as hot as summer pavement, but surprisingly soft and easy to grip. She felt woozy being so close to it, Keith’s musk filling her nostrils and almost lulling her into a trance. Keith seemed to take notice as well. Dustin could hear him groan and grunt in his superhumanly deep voice as she crawled her way towards his cocktip, and his thrusting became faster and rougher. She spluttered as a wave of precum splashed over her face. “Oh god! I can feel it under my bra! Goddamn it Ty!” She choked as she finally crested the throbbing head of Keith’s fuck pillar.<br />
“Mrs. Richardson!” Dustin gasped. “Give me your hand!” The young woman had slipped out of sight, her hands gripping tightly to the sensitive cocktip. Dustin grabbed her and immediately she slipped out of her grasp, slicked by the torrent of precum. Dustin grabbed once more and pulled. Mrs. Richardson’s head crowned from the cleavage of Keith’s piss slit. “Don’t... let go!” Dustin said as she tugged. “We have to... get out of here before...”<br />
The moment had come. Even through the walls of the classroom, Keith’s voice boomed like thunder, shaking the building. The giant phallus bulged grotesquely as it’s owner roared in triumph. “YES!!! FUCK YES, I’M THE BIGGEST FUCKING THAT’S EVER LIVED!!! SO HUGE!!! SO PUMPED!!! I’M A FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOD!!!”<br />
Dustin had just enough time to see Mrs. Richardson’s cheeks balloon outwards before being eclipsed by white. Dustin had pulled her into the perfect position for Keith to force untold gallons of cum pumping down the teacher’s throat.<br />
Dustin twisted in the flood for several moments before she could break the surface and gasp for air. The classroom was completely painted in the pearly muck, and the front wall had been completely blown away. Mrs. Richardson laid on her back a few meters away. She was whole, but bloated nearly beyond recognition, her breasts and belly jutting lewdly towards the sky. She was gushing cum from her mouth and nose.<br />
Weak from her ordeal, Dustin could only collapse with a splash on the wet ground. There was a comically cock-shaped hole in the ceiling where Keith had lifted straight up, and she could see the maniacal giant himself blotting out the sun through it perfectly. If Keith had looked monstrously out of proportion before, he was an utter freak of nature now. Packed with what was likely literal tons of muscle, his body was thicker than it was tall. His shoulders bulged from atop titanic globes of pec meat, and he raised his arms to show off bicep peaks that filled the entire space from ear to wrist. Every fiber of his brawn pressed against the other, there was barely any space around the ball of muscle he’d become for him to flex any more, and yet he couldn’t stop. Only slightly softened, his cock, seventy feet long if it was an inch, was still drooling cum onto the roof of the school below. “I’M SOOO HUGE.” he moaned. His voice was so deep and booming, the ground vibrated. “SO SEXY. SO MUSCULAR. FUCKING STUD. FUCKING PERFECT. BIGGER. MORE PERFECT MUSCLE. MORE PERFECT COCK. MORE FUCKING PERFECT ME!!!!”<br />
Dustin could hear approaching sirens, as well as what sounded like a crowd of voices chanting. The school was worshipping the egomaniac. Just as she struggled to think of what to do next, the classroom door fell off its hinges with a splash. Ty stood in the doorway, holding his head. “Ty! Thank god!” Dustin whimpered.<br />
“My head hurts...” Ty said in a dazed voice. “Where am I? What the hell’s going on around here?”</p>
