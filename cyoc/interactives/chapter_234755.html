<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach was in agony, time and time again his family abused the power and took control of his body without his approval. He was tired, after all the times Molly embarrassed him, walking buck nacked around the house and in the backyard for all the neighbours to see, for all the times his mom took over to punish him for the littlest things like not taking out the trash. And now, his mom did the worst thing ever, he outed him as gay and is hooking up with his crush. Zack wanted to stop, to go home and forget about all the embarrassment he felt tonight, but he was stuck, hopeless in his own head, while his mom was groping Blake&#39;s firm musscles, and kissing his soft lips. He was lost... until he felt the tingling, his own power finally awakening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo!&quot; Zack starded screaming as Blake was reaching a hand for his speedo eclosing his tight bonner. &quot;Not like this!&quot; said Zack wile kicking Blake&#39;s hand away.<br />
Blake was shocked, he was really enjoying this moment and thought Zack was happy too. &quot;Is everything ok, if I&#39;m moving to fast I&#39;m really sorry, I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a long time&quot; said Blake with a concerned look. <br />
Zack was surprised to find that he was in control. He remembered the tingling in his head while his mother was using his body to kiss Blake, and the next thing he knew he was pushing Blake away while screaming. He had to get away and think.&quot;I&#39;m really sorry I need to go&quot; said Zack while getting up, washed by a wave of dizziness due to all the alcohol his mother consumed in his body. He rushed into the house, to pick his clothes and call his dad for a ride back home. He found his backpack, and called his dad while putting his clothes on, luckly he answered. &quot;Hi mom, how&#39;s the party?&quot; said Jeffrey&#39;s voice on the phone. Zack thought that thus was perfect, like things couldn&#39;t get much worse. &quot;Molly, why are you possesing dad, you should be asleep?&quot; <br />
&quot;Dad? Zach is that you, was mom finally able to get out? Also, dad said I can posses him while you 2 are at a party, so I don&#39;tfeel left out&quot; said Molly while munching on some popcorn. <br />
 &quot;Not sure what happened, I think I awakened my power and mom is sleeping in my head. I don&#39;t know how to talk to her. Please, can you get out of dad so he can come and drive me home?&quot; cried Zack, worried that he didn&#39;t know what happened to his mom.<br />
&quot;Sorry bro, but I&#39;m not done playing with dad, and he said I am not allowed to drive in his body or he&#39;ll never let me posses him again.&quot; said Molly ending the call while reaching a hand in Jeffrey&#39;s underwear. <br />
<br />
Zach was angry, and scared, and dizzy from the high emotions of the past hour and the drinks. He called a taxi, which he paid with some money he had hidden away in his backpack. <br />
<br />
30 minutes later Zack was home, and entering the house. He saw his dad in the kitchen. &quot;Hi Zack, Molly told me you are back in your body. Where&#39;s mom?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not swure dad&quot; said Zack while sluring his words. &quot;Are you drunk? What happened at the party?&quot; asked Jeffrey concerned while handing Zack a glass of water.<br />
&quot;Mom had a bit to mucwh to drinks&quot; said Zack. &quot;My powwer awakened and I took back control and came home&quot; confessed Zack while avoiding the actual details regarding his crush on Blake. It was enough that his mom found out, he was not ready to tell his dad. <br />
&quot;Have you tried letting Maddie speak?&quot; asked Jeffrey. <br />
&quot;Im sorry. Not sure how to dwo that&quot; answered Zack  <br />
&quot;We&#39;ll figure it out in the morning, go sleep for now it&#39;svery late.&quot; said Jeffrey concerned. He didn&#39;t know much more than Zack about the family power, he never experienced being in control of someone else, so he couldn&#39;t guide Zack on this matter. <br />
&quot;Ok dad, good night&quot;<br />
&quot;Good night son&quot; said Jeffery.<br />
<br />
As Zack made his way into his room, he noticed a lot of missed texts from Blake. He was worried that he pushed Zack to much in one night. If only he knew that Zack wasn&#39;t even in control, that his mom was actually the one that kissed Blake. <br />
He wasn&#39;t sure what to answer, and was to drunk to think. He washed his face, and took off his clothes going to sleep in the nude. He never did that but he couldn&#39;t stand wearing the speedo for a minute longer and he was too tired and drunk to find a clean pair of underwear.</p>
