<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was not long later that Clare was cleaning the silverwear in the dining room, a room that was apart from the rest of the house and not used except on special occasions. She was cleaning away trying not to think of anything but the task at hand when she heard a noise from behind her. Matt stood there with a smile on as he looked at her. Clare's heart raced... had he remembered something? &quot;Your looking very tired today Clare.&quot; he said as he walked forward, closing the door behind him, &quot;why don't you put down that dish and come over here.&quot; Clare's heart sank. Not only had he not remembered but he was being deliberately flirtasious with her, whilst going out with her sister. This was all becoming too much to bear. She tried to turn away and carry on, ignoring him, but found she couldn't. He was a guest of the house and she was obliged to serve him, she reasoned. She walked over, avoiding direct eye contact. Matt walked forward and reached around her. &quot;Olivia's gone up to her room to change for our outing, she'll be at least an hour. What do you say you and I pass the time?&quot; he said putting one hand on her rear. Clare tried to move away but found she couldn't. How far did her obdeience stretch? She feared the worst.<br />
<br />
Matt leaned in closer and their lips locked. He was more agressive, pushy, not the gentle Matt she once knew. This was different, she hated it, but was powerless to stop it. His hands found there way up and down her back, one settling on her ass as the other stroked her. He pulled her tight against his body, pushing her chest against his. She let out a squeak as he massaged her rear, only exciting him more. His hand found the zip and he slowly loosened it, his mouth still ravaging hers. If Clare could have cried she would have but the powers that governed her allowed no such thing. The dress fell slowly down and Matt wriggled and rithed to allow it more room, whilst occasionally pausing to help Clare remove an arm. The Dress soon hit the floor and she was left standing in her pink underwhere whilst Matt's hands continued to rove up and down her body.<br />
<br />
One hand moved up from her ass to her back whilst the hand that was previously there was brought round the front to 'play' with the new toys. Clare was mortified. Matt was never like this. He'd neer done this to her, he had always respected her body and women in general. The hand cupped one breast and Clare let out a gasp. &quot;so you are enjoying it!&quot; Matt exclaimed as he brought the other hand around now to join in. Clare was backed against the wall with Matt now making circles with her breasts. A swift hand action followed and Clare's bra joined the dress on the floor. Matt now took full advantage of the exposed veiw and continued to play and enjoy his new toys. Clare could only stand and take it. It was humiliating, violating, but she could do nothing. Her pulse quicked, her heart pouning and strangely, Clare realized she was starting to enjoy it. Her family were only a short way away, they could walk in any moment, she was exposed, humiliated, and now loving every second her old boyfreind spent tormenting her body with lust. Her hands roamed up and down his body with the same motion his had shown. She felt the mounting pressure in his groin, and the wetness in hers. It drove her crazy.<br />
<br />
Matt soon obliged and brought a hand down to the now sodden panties. Touching through the fabric drove Clare mad and she quickly helped discard the final garment and barrier. Matt now exposed himself to match, and not long after, Clare's arms were wrapped around Matt's neck, his hands on her ass, her back against the wall, and they were feeling the full force of the passion. Clare gasped as she rode him, Matt gasped as he fucked her hard. The feeling was building and the pants and gasps were getting louder and louder until eventually they both Climaxed together.<br />
<br />
Clare slid down the wall as Matt stood from his moment. He began to redress himself and turned away. &quot;Wait!&quot; Clare said as she sat there, now only wearing her headress and the evidence of there act still clearly visible on her, &quot;what now?&quot; Matt turned and stared with a smile &quot;I guess you go back to work, I've got a date with my girlfreind.&quot; The word were like a nife through Clare and she sat and stared, visibly shaking from what he had just said. This was no longer just embarassing, it was torture.</p>
