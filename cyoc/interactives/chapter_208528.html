<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the kid was enjoying his time in his older body, a thought popped into Bob&#39;s mind. <br />
&quot;&#120331;&#120368; &#120336; &#120358;&#120375;&#120358;&#120367; &#120367;&#120358;&#120358;&#120357; &#120373;&#120368; &#120360;&#120358;&#120373; &#120355;&#120354;&#120356;&#120364; &#120373;&#120368; &#120373;&#120361;&#120354;&#120373; &#120355;&#120368;&#120357;&#120378;?&quot; he asked himself. While he&#39;s still in his mid-20s, the years of drug abuse took a heavy toll on his appearance. His hair is ashen and receding. Although strong, an outside perspective made Bob more aware of how thin he looked. Prison food wastes your body more than he imagined. And even if that body remained healthy, what life is left for that husk? His family is dead, and his foster and friends abandoned him. And how can he bounce back with a shitty record and 17 measly bucks? That body is steps away from being one homeless bum on the street. Although it sickens him to do this, he&#39;d rather stay as this kid than go back to that decaying husk.<br />
<br />
While the kid is distracted, Bob sneaked away until he found Officer Jim on a smoking break. &quot;&#120334;&#120371;&#120358;&#120354;&#120373;,&quot; Bob thought as another sick idea came to mind. He approached the officer who gave him a look he hasn&#39;t seen before. Gone were the disdainful eyes. The officer broke a sweet smile and immediately snuffed his cigarette. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heya there, Luke. I&#39;m &#39;fraid your ma&#39;s still talking inside.&quot; Officer Jim said. Bob couldn&#39;t remember the last time he cried, but he mustered his all for this act. &quot;Why the long face, kiddo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th- that mister...&quot; Bob pointed to the parking lot where his old body is inspecting himself in a police car&#39;s mirror. &quot;He- he touched me. I said no, but he... he...&quot; Bob fakely choked his voice. When he realized he looked ridiculous, he jumped at Officer Jim and buried his fake cries in his leg. Bob prayed to the heavens and back that Jim would buy it. That cunt never believed him one bit while he was inside the prison. <br />
<br />
Jim picked up the walkie-talkie on his hip, &quot;Officer Jim, requesting back up.&quot; But before the backup came, Jim was already approaching the kid with a handcuff in hand. In one swift second, Bob&#39;s body was on the floor with Jim&#39;s knees keeping him in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t act like an idiot you sick fuck. I expected you&#39;d return to prison one day, but I didn&#39;t expect it to be this soon.&quot; Other officers arrived and as they did, Jim said, &quot;You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law&quot;<br />
<br />
The kid looked at Bob and pleaded with him for help. He screamed about how Bob is a criminal, and that he was just a kid. That their bodies have been swapped. He screamed for his mom amid the laughter of the other officers. In their eyes, Bob has lost it. His time in prison knocked all sense from his mind. Amid it all, the real Bob acted without a care in the world. He wasn&#39;t happy that he just placed an innocent person in prison, but that&#39;s what it&#39;d take to tie that loose end. He can&#39;t have the kid prattling in public about swapping bodies. The best place for him to rave that truthful nonsense is behind bars. If fate would permit it, they&#39;d transfer him to a psychiatric ward. <br />
<br />
As the events neared its close, Officer Jim crouched in front of Bob and gave him a deep hug. &quot;Are you alright, Luke? Are you hurt anywhere?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Bob smiled. &quot;No. Can I go back to my ma&#39;?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; The building doors rushed open to reveal a distraught woman who immediately rushed for a hug towards Bob. Officer Jim stepped back and let the two talk to each other, while he returned to the building but not before ordering the other officers to guard them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, Luke. I repeatedly told you to never leave my side. See what happened!? And now you gave problems to these officers? Are you proud of what you&#39;ve done?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I- I-&quot; Bob was taken aback. He did not expect his mother to be this much of a bitch. It was as if it was his fault that he got touched by a predator, even though he knew all of this is a farce of his design, but still. &quot;Get in the car so I can deal with this mess you&#39;ve made.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a silent car ride back home. Bob could see how pissed his new mother is, but deep inside, he knew there were other things she got pissed about. It was by chance that she somehow talked about it in the middle of the ride. She spoke about her new boyfriend whom she thought would take care of her and her son, Luke. Then he got his ass in prison, and she came in asking if he had some money stashed somewhere so he could fulfill his duty as a stepfather. It&#39;s funny how she thought that a man who would land his ass in prison would keep his damn word. Of course, she got chewed out and got called for being a gold digger. And amid it all, Bob was amused about how her mom already forgot Bob&#39;s encounter with a predator. <br />
&quot;&#120350;&#120361;&#120354;&#120373; &#120354; &#120372;&#120358;&#120365;&#120359;-&#120356;&#120358;&#120367;&#120373;&#120358;&#120371;&#120358;&#120357; &#120355;&#120362;&#120373;&#120356;&#120361;,&quot; he thought. <br />
But even as a bitch, her mother&#39;s got some good looks. Bob would have mused her appearance if he wasn&#39;t so distracted by the endless rumbling of his stomach. Holy fuck. This kid&#39;s last meal could&#39;ve been yesterday. <br />
<br />
After half an hour, the car stopped in front of a trailer. He knew the place since this is where his third (or was it the fourth?) foster family lived. Those sons of bitches only got him for the money that he comes with. Didn&#39;t stay long. And by the looks of it, their trash heap of a home has already been bulldozed off from the face of the Earth. The two left the car and entered one of the many trailers in the field. However, theirs is a lot cleaner than the rest. His mother popped cold nuggets in the microwave and turned the television on. She called someone on the phone, and by the end of it, she was saying her goodbyes to Bob.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how to take care of yourself,&quot; Her mom dug for a cheap lipstick in her purse and immediately applied a thick layer on her lips. &quot;Don&#39;t try to call me because I won&#39;t answer.&quot; and with that, she&#39;s gone for the night. Bob knew the types. Gone in a flash and won&#39;t return for a few days. They were like his childhood - but the difference is that his mother ain&#39;t a whore. She worked an honest job at a 9-to-5 diner. As for him, Bob knew the whole charade as if it happened yesterday. He popped the nuggets out of the microwave and lulled himself to sleep with the television in the background.<br />
<br />
And just like Bob thought, his mother wasn&#39;t back the morning after. He grabbed his phone with a broken screen. It&#39;s 9 AM on a cloudy Sunday morning. The background picture is that of a baseball field, probably Luke&#39;s interest. And lucky for him, phones nowadays can be unlocked with your face. Inside the phone, Luke kept a complete schedule of his days, and Bob even got a glimpse at the kid&#39;s early exposure to pornography based on the search history. Luke goes to school from 10-4 every weekday. And that school is a place Bob is quite familiar with. Despite transferring from one foster family to another, he studied only in one school - until it was cut short by his frequent trips to juvie and prison. <br />
<br />
But today is Sunday, and his schedule is left blank. As such, Bob made use of the time to finally discover this new body. He went to the bathroom which was filled with her mother&#39;s cheap boutiques and hamper of unwashed clothes. Luke&#39;s got a sweet innocent face. His skin is unblemished, his eyes brown and full, but his hair is thick and unkempt. The boy&#39;s frame is thin, a figure Bob is well reminded of. As for his member... he didn&#39;t expect much which left him a greater surprise. It&#39;s small by adult standards, but for his age, the boy is packing. Bob is sure that it ain&#39;t his meals that caused this. His bitch of a mother must have fucked a horse for him to have this length. Nonetheless, this package is useless until a few more years. Not like he&#39;s going to use it. <br />
<br />
And Bob&#39;s already naked, so he might as well proceed with taking a bath. </p>
<hr/><h3>
After the bath, what did Bob do next?</h3>
