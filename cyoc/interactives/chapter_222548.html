<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay, me first!” Isabella said, trying her best not to waste time. She grabbed her change card, then her action card. She turned over the change card first, finding it to be blank, “Oh right.” She said, chuckling nervously to herself. She turned over the action card, ‘Combine Two Change Cards’… weird.<br />
She grabbed another change card, quickly turning it over, “it said Combine Two Cards, and I picked up ‘Bovine Horns’ and ‘Big Nose’… and they’re… they’re changing!” She announced. Harry and Isabella watched as the two cards fused together, becoming one brand-new card, “the card says ‘Bull Ring’?” She announced.<br />
As she said it, she felt a cold sting in her nose, feeling a minor weight increase as the ring formed, becoming a lot larger than a traditional septum piercing.<br />
“We’ll check it out after!” Harry chimed in, grabbing his own Action and Change cards, trying to get as quickly to Milo’s turn as they could.<br />
Isabella looked over to Milo, who had given up trying to ‘play’ with Judy, now casually masturbating alone. His massive shaft looked so difficult to work with. She looked over a Judy,<br />
“Are you okay?” She asked,<br />
“Yeah… I’m fine. Just not used to him being so aggressive. Not a huge fan…” she said, forcing a smile.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I got ‘No Action Applies’ and ‘Totally Tongue’!” He finished, Isabella and Judy watched as his tongue swelled, getting longer and a little thicker,<br />
“C’mon, it’s your turn now!” Harry said, concerned for her and Milo. He looked to be at the end of his masturbation session, they needed to get through this quick.<br />
As Judy selected his cards, beginning to read them and announce it to the table, Milo kept his eyes firmly on Harry. He couldn’t help it. With his uncontrollable horniness, unable to hide the fact that all he wanted to do right was orgasm, his body yearned for it to be inside of Harry. He couldn’t stop the thoughts. The more he pushed them back, the more came back. More and more and more, until he could do nothing but stare at his former best friend, now cock-wielding sex-goddess…<br />
His brain was fried…<br />
<br />
“My cards say: ‘Quintuple Card’… so that means it’s the card times by four? Right?” She looked to Isabella, the teacher,<br />
“Uhm… yeah. Yeah that’s right!” Isabella said, “what’s your change?” She asked, apprehensively,<br />
“It’s… ‘Extreme Genital Shrinking’…” she said.<br />
As she said this, she winced. She looked down, forgetting her lack of visibility due to her expanded chest, “it can’t seriously— OH!” She yelped, feeling it reduce once again. She placed her hand over her dress, trying to feel her vagina, but she couldn’t. She reached under, rubbing her panties, once again she had a surge of confusing pleasure. She couldn’t help but reach into her panties, all the way underneath her dress, and feel for her pussy.<br />
“AH!” She screamed. Everyone’s attention was on her, “no no no no NO!” She shouted with horror,<br />
“What’s wrong?” Isabella asked, concerned. Judy had gotten up, standing tall, feeling around for her genitals,<br />
“It’s gone!” She cried, “like… it’s totally gone!!!” She yelped,<br />
“It’s okay!” Isabella said, standing herself up, her body jiggling as she moved so rapidly.<br />
<br />
Milo, returning to his turn, was beginning to regain his focus. Yet, he continued to jack himself off. Harry had stood up as well, going over to help both Judy and Isabella. Milo, still sitting on the floor, could see under Harry’s skirt. He saw not only Harry’s cock bulge, but a part of his clit. He was so overwhelmingly turned on, he started thrusting harder.<br />
Before he could do anything else however, his cards slid from the pile, appearing in front of his eyes, floating with some mysterious magical force. He didn’t bother reading his cards, merely glancing at them as they appeared in front of him.<br />
As he continued to masturbate, his arms moving up and down and up and down, Judy looked over at him.<br />
In her frustrated, confused, and upset state, she began to stomp at him,<br />
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?” She shouted, Izzy and Harry wanting to intervene, knowing this was just the card, not a lack of empathy, “YOU’RE JUST SITTING THERE, JACKING OFF, LIKE NOTHING IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. FUN FACT; I JUST LOST MY PUSSY!? HAPPY!” She yelled angrily. But as she did, she could see that his cock wasn’t just hard… it was swelling, “m-more…” she said, looking as his already massive, thick, veiny cock was becoming bigger and bigger. His hand to use his whole arm to rub it right, and as he came to his climax, he began to realise what was going on. His awareness returning; his horniness subsiding. Right as he reached his climax.<br />
<br />
He came, then and there, and hard. He felt his load explode right into… Harry.<br />
“AGH!” Harry yelped as a burst of warm white semen hit him square in the chest. Then the second load hit, it shot him right in the face, “BLEH!” He yelped, quickly ducking down and covering his eyes,<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING!?” Judy yelled as Milo let out a third, and final, huge load right into the ceiling. He wasn’t aiming for anything else. The cum splatted everywhere, rebounding from the ceiling onto everything. Onto Judy, onto Izzy, even more onto Harry. Everyone had at least a small string of semen on them in some place… and Harry. He looked traumatised.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Milo continued to apologise, profusely. Not only to his girlfriend, but to Isabella, and especially to Harry.<br />
Usually, in this type of scenario, Harry would be relaxed, Milo would be relaxed, they’d laugh it off and tease each other about it in the future. But not today.<br />
Harry knew it was because of a card, but the fact he’d him him… twice. He felt, so uncomfortable. He couldn’t help but shake.<br />
<br />
“Harry please… I really… you know I didn’t…”<br />
“I know, I know.” Harry said, “just give me a few minutes to clean up…” he said, walking off to Judy and Milo’s guest bathroom,<br />
“No no!” Judy said, she grabbed Harry’s shoulder, “use our bathroom, the main one. You need to wash off, okay,”<br />
“Y-yeah…” Harry said. He walked in the other direction, practically dripping with cum, still in his nicely done hair, all in his dress, his cleavage. He just felt so disgusting, and though he didn’t necessarily blame Milo, he felt so much anger towards him. Why? He’d been looking at him funny, ever since he got that damn card… it had to just be the card. It doesn’t matter, all Harry needs is to get cleaned up, get changed, and get back to the game.<br />
<br />
“Me and Izzy are going to clean ourselves up,” Judy said, she still looked somewhat angry,<br />
“Babe… you know I didn’t do that!”<br />
“I KNOW!” Judy said, unable to control herself, “look… we just need… like five to ten minutes,” Judy said as calmly as she could. But she couldn’t stop herself from stomping a little as she went to the bathroom.<br />
Izzy held back, looking at Milo,<br />
“I don’t blame you. No one does,” she said, taking a pause, “but we all need our space after all that, okay?” She said,<br />
“Yeah… I know. I just… I hated that. All of it,”<br />
“I know. I can tell,” she said, “give me a call in a minute, I’ll come sit with you, we can just talk. Okay?”<br />
“Yeah. Okay.” Milo said. She smiled at him as she followed Judy into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Milo sat by himself, quietly. He’d managed to stuff the now comically oversized member back into his shorts, hoping it would remain at bay.<br />
He thought more, about when Judy had gotten the ‘Bimbo IQ’ card as well as the ‘Uncontrollably Horny’ card, she hadn’t acted anything like him, if anything she was just overtly turned on… nothing to the level he’d been at. He had a thought, maybe it was a double card, even a triple card. Had he missed something, it didn’t make sense. He had a high libido normally, but nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
As he turned over all the action cards, he found a card he hadn’t read before… possibly his own card. Maybe he hadn’t read it in the midst of everything that went on.<br />
<br />
“What?” He said to himself,<br />
“Uhm… what’s going on?” A voice said from behind.<br />
Milo assumed it to be Isabella, although her voice sounded a little different from what he knew. He slowly turned around, and was instead greeted by an unfamiliar face…<br />
<br />
“Where am I…” she said, backing away, slowly. He could see her immediately looking for some kind of exit,<br />
“Hi, uhm, I’m Milo. I’m not like here to hurt you or anything,” he said awkwardly,<br />
“How did I get here…” the woman asked,<br />
“I think I brought you here with magic or something,”<br />
“What?” She asked, looking even more nervous,<br />
“IZZY!” Milo called out, unsure of what else he could do,<br />
“One second!” Izzy called out,<br />
“NO I MEAN NOW IZZY PLEASE!” He yelled again,<br />
“Izzy…” the woman said, “l-like Isabella?”<br />
“Y-yeah,” he said.<br />
Just then, Isabella appeared, she opened the bathroom door, revealing herself, “what’s wroo-” she paused, looking right at the woman, who seemed to have suddenly appeared, “Betty?” She said, shocked,<br />
“Isabella!?” Betty yelled, “w-what the hell happened to you!?” She cried,<br />
“Oh, oh right!”<br />
“I thought you were sick!” <br />
“I’m not!” Isabella said, trying to calm her friend down, “we’re… this is…” she stuttered, unsure of how to put it, “this is Milo, he’s okay. He’s a friend,” she explained.<br />
Then, Judy showed herself, ducking as she stepped out from the bathroom. Her hair still a little wet from washing it,<br />
“What the hell…” Judy said, looking at this completely unknown woman. Betty was in awe of Judy’s body, unsure whether or not her curves were natural, silicone, or if she’d somehow fallen asleep and started dreaming of this giant plastic goddess. “Who is this?” Judy asked, seeming a little accusatory of Milo,<br />
“It was a card!” Milo said, “look!” He said, holding up the card that had been in his hand the whole time. Isabella took it from his hand and showed it Judy as they read it together, ‘New Player Added’.<br />
“Shit.” Isabella said, looking back up at Betty, “alright, we need to explain some things to you, because this is gonna make absolutely no sense, okay?”<br />
“Y’know…” Betty started, once again glancing between the three extremely attractive people in front of her, “I’m just gonna go if it’s okay?”<br />
“I’m… not sure you can,” Isabella said,<br />
“Isabella, look, I know you. It’s okay, this whole thing, I’m sure you can explain it to me another time,” Betty started, slowly walking towards the door, still keeping her distance from the three, “but I just need to get out of here, you guys can get back to your game!” She said with a very forced, very nervous chuckle,<br />
“Wait!” Isabella said, Betty barely hesitated, “I don’t think you can leave! Like it’s not a good idea!” She said very worried,<br />
“No it’s really fine!” Betty said. She turned, finding the front door to the apartment.<br />
<br />
But just as she was opening the door, she looked to her left, catching the eye of someone else. A young woman with wet hair, she had a towel wrapped around her, clearly just gotten out of the shower,<br />
“Betty?” The woman asked. Betty could recognise her, but… she looked a lot younger,<br />
“Y-you’re Isabella’s mother… but younger!?” She asked,<br />
“Huh? Oh… yeah no I’m not her mother,” she replied, “look I’m Harry,”<br />
“W-what…” Betty said, so utterly in disbelief of what was going on right now. She looked back, seeing the three looking at her nervously, then back at ‘Harry’. She shook her head, “nope.” She said as she opened the front door and walked out.<br />
The door shut behind her.<br />
<br />
“What just happened…” Harry said, looking at the rest of the group, still struggling a little to look at Milo, “why was Betty here?” He asked,<br />
“It was a card,” Isabella said, “Milo’s card. It said ‘New Player Added’,” she explained, showing her boyfriend the card,<br />
“Shit…” Harry said, “someone needs to grab her, we don’t know what will happen if she just walks out of the game!”<br />
“That’s what I said,” Isabella said, looking back at Milo and Judy, both keeping their distance from one-another, “I’ll get her,” Isabella said, “someone needs to help if I get stuck or something,”<br />
“Just shout,” Harry said, “I’ll be there,”<br />
<br />
Isabella went to the door and opened it quickly, hearing the faint footsteps down the stairwell,<br />
“Betty!” She called out, making her way slowly down the stairwell, careful not to trip and fall. She could already feel a punishment beginning, something around her stomach. She continued down the stairwell, but places her hand on her stomach, feeling some kind of pressure. It was definitely swelling, and not in a fat way, nor a juice way. It was swelling with air. She could feel it spreading too, now into her breasts. It didn’t make her feel any heavier, if anything it made her feel lighter; but that wasn’t necessarily a good thing.<br />
She made her way further, feeling her breasts beginning to inflate, as well as her rear. She could hear Betty, getting closer and closer, until she finally found her… or what she assumed was Betty.<br />
<br />
“I-Izzy…” a child, no younger than seven years old said. She had bright orange hair, a white t-shirt and blue shorts, just like Betty had been wearing all day, now shrunken down to fit her,<br />
“It’s me,” Izzy said. As soon as she said this, she felt her top burst right open, revealing her balloon-like cleavage, “can we go upstairs? It’ll fix this,”<br />
“Really?” Betty asked, still actively getting younger and younger,<br />
“Yeah,” Izzy said, “I don’t really want to be a balloon by the end of this, so can we go now?”<br />
Without answering, Betty held up her hands to be picked up. Isabella leaned down, unable to really see what she was doing and picked up Betty. She then quickly made her way up the stairs, still growing bigger and bigger.<br />
By the time she got to the fourth floor, she could feel herself growing far too big to move. Betty, who’d been weighing her down at this point, had gotten so small, somewhere around three-to-two years old, was no longer doing so.<br />
Isabella kept tight hold of her once adult, now infant friend, and felt herself rising off the ground.<br />
<br />
Isabella began to float, like a balloon filled with helium. She continued to inflate as she floated higher and higher, hitting each wall, ceiling, floor as she approached the fifth floor.<br />
As she aimlessly floated around, she spotted the door to Milo and Judy’s apartment, catching the glance of Judy, who immediately looked shocked by what she was seeing,<br />
“Grab… baby…” Isabella was able to say, with air immediately exiting her mouth and opened it. She passed Betty over to Harry, who took her back into the apartment. Milo quickly ran out and grabbed as much of Isabella as he could. Judy followed, helping him get a better grip.<br />
The two looked at each other with determination, they struggled as they pulled hard, bringing Isabella as close to the door as they could.<br />
<br />
As soon as Isabella made contact with the door-frame, her mouth forced itself open and began to blow out an intense amount of air, pushing both Milo and Judy to the ground.<br />
Milo rose to his feet quickly, holding out his hand to help Judy up. With hesitation, then that same determination, she grabbed it and got back to her feet.<br />
Izzy was now half the size she was, deflating rapidly.<br />
Harry was watching Betty as she began to progress back to her usual twenty-four year old age, now around eleven.<br />
<br />
By the time Isabella was just big enough to fit through the door, Milo and Judy prepared to grab her.<br />
But instead, Isabella’s air supply slowed, and came to a halt. She looked pretty shaken.<br />
“Izzy?” Both Judy and Milo said in unison,<br />
“Y-yeah…” Izzy said. She looked down, seeing her belly was still somewhat bloated. She stepped into the apartment, and felt a little air travel up her body, and exit out of her mouth. It wasn’t quite a belch, more like a big exhalation.<br />
<br />
Before long, she was somewhat back to normal. Still, of course, in her sexy-fat state. Her clothes were almost completely torn however,<br />
“Betty,” Isabella said, making her way over to the now seventeen year old version of her friend, still growing a little more,<br />
“Hi,” Betty said awkwardly, “that was…”<br />
“Intense,” Isabella said with a smirk,<br />
“Yep. It’s weird going back to being a kid. Or even a baby,” she said, a little more casually than anyone would’ve expected, “but going through puberty again, this time a little faster… that was the weirdest part,”<br />
“Yeah there’s a lot of growing…” Harry said,<br />
“Clearly…” Betty said, looking him up and down again, “I can’t believe you got, what? Transformed into a girl?”<br />
“Kinda,” Harry said, “let’s explain it, as a group,” Harry said, looking around to the others, all of which were very open to explaining it all to her.<br />
<br />
The group sat, for almost twenty minutes, explaining the game. They explained how the game worked, what the game could do, what’d happened to them, and what could possibly happen to her. They all decided not to mention how the last game had ended, choosing to discuss it another time.<br />
They all felt sorry, as they’d all consented to be a part of the game in the first place, whereas she hadn’t.<br />
By the end of the explanation, and after a few questions, such as what the winner is rewarded, she seemed fairly okay with playing the game to the end. As long as the Wish was used to benefit everyone, not for selfish gain.<br />
<br />
However, the group was unsure of who was to play next, as Betty was a new player.</p>
