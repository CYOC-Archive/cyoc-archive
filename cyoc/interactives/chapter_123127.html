<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha arrived home just before the rain started to fall. Having to stay at the elementary school to help facilitate the changeover; Martha was surprised to find out that the new school being built by Benton Knight will soon be ready despite the numerous delays during its construction. Built to replace the current school; a building that is over one hundred years old for the faculty section, Moon Lake’s Elementary school was expanded upon throughout the years to meet an ever growing population. No thought was ever made, surprisingly to replace the building with something more modern and energy efficient.<br />
<br />
As it stood, the current elementary school was barely able to remain standing. Requiring major rework to its structural core. After last year’s major storm flooding the basement and causing a severe roof leak; it was discovered the footing were undermined thanks to the loose soil the school was sitting on. Repeated rainfalls, slowly washing away the soil, the concrete chipping and peeling off exposing the rusting rebar in certain sections.<br />
<br />
As such, Martha had no clue that Eric was attacked by a teacher none the less. Forgetting her phone at home after leaving for work to teach class and then to head over to the new school; Martha never received the messages that were left to her by both William and Principal Andrews. Getting out of her car, Martha looked up at the sky and knew it was going to pour any moment; not wasting anytime she grabbed her purse and school bag, hightailing it inside.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the front door, Martha sees William placing a couple of candles about.<br />
“Just in case the power goes out,” William noticing Martha getting in; “we don’t want to be stumbling about in the dark.”<br />
“Ever since we became were-foxes,” Martha putting her belongs down; “we never had that problem.”<br />
“Old habits then,” William placing the last candle; “speaking of old habits, you forgot your cell phone. I noticed it on the kitchen table when I got back from picking Eric up from school today.”<br />
“I know,” Martha sighing; “I realized after I got to the elementary school today. Were there any messages for me?”<br />
“Yes,” William pausing; “from both me and Principal Andrews. We even called the school to get a hold of you.”<br />
“About what,” Martha rushing to the kitchen to retrieve her phone; checking the messages, sitting down as she reads the first text asking her to get over to the high school right away. Eric was assaulted.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Eric was upstairs in his room, staring at his reflection in the mirror. Looking at his bandaged nose, Eric sighs as he turns around to pick up his school bag. Opening it up he sees the subjects he missed today; Science, history as well as some of the college courses he signed up for. With that being a majority of his school work, Eric set about to starting his homework when he noticed something that made him growl.<br />
<br />
“Is this the math that fat piggy had planned,” Eric looking at the math problems; “I bet he was hoping to stump me with this.”<br />
Putting down the math homework, Eric notices a note attached to it.<br />
‘Eric, this was the school work Jeff Wilson had planned before he assaulted you. You don’t need to complete it right away, as the substitute teacher that I had to call up is still preparing for the class. But it will be due on Friday; I know you’ll do well.’<br />
<br />
“Well that is one thing not worry about,” Eric putting the note from Principal Andrews down;  “and since I don’t have math tomorrow, all the better.”<br />
Putting the math work aside, Eric was about to dig into his science when her heard a shrill scream followed by vicious snarl. Eric didn’t need to be in his fursona to hear that is mother just got home and now knows what happened to him.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Nate steps into the door after being dropped off by Jean; nearly tripping over his mother’s purse and school bag, Nate was thankful that the cane he help prevent him falling to the ground. Already needing it to help him remain balanced as his inner ear heals from the savage beating he received last Monday; Nate was not keen to add an additional injury that could prolong his recovery.<br />
<br />
Just as he was putting his school bag down, Nate was basted with a shrill scream and a vicious snarl. Seeing his mother storming out of the kitchen in her were-vixen fursona and storming upstairs; Nate stares at his father who is shaking his head.<br />
“Guess mom now knows what happened to Eric,” Nate kicking off his shoes.<br />
“That is on way of looking at it,” William answering; “Put your school bag away and help me in the kitchen getting supper ready.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“Eric! Eric!”<br />
Turning his head as the door to his room is opened, Eric sees a red blur rushing in and smothering him; nearly crushing him as he tries to resist. Quickly picking up his mother’s scent, Eric relaxes a bit but still struggles to break free from his mother’s surprisingly strong grip.<br />
“Let me go,” Eric mumbling as he tries to break free.<br />
“What happened Eric,” Martha slowly letting Eric go; “in your own words.”<br />
“I was punched by fat piggy,” Eric looking up at his mother; “he blamed me for the principal removing him from class before it started. Claiming that it was my doing that the school discovered that his teaching credentials were falsified.”<br />
“Was it,” Martha looking at Eric; seeing the bandage over his nose. “Was it your fault?”<br />
“No,” Eric shrugging his shoulders; “I may have told Frieda and Spencer about fat piggy. And Frieda may have told her father about the man; but I never hired the private investigator that dug up dirt on the man. That was Frieda’s father that did that.”<br />
“And where is the teacher that decked you,” Martha examining the bandage nose.<br />
“In jail as far as I know,” Eric answering; “I was so mad after the teacher hit me, I exploded into my fursona at school. If it wasn’t for Frieda and Spencer; I might have mauled the were-pig teacher.”<br />
“Your father told me that,” Martha responding; pausing as she thought about what to say next.<br />
<br />
“My nose will be fine,” Eric wanting to go back to his homework; “the doctor who reset it said it will be fully healed as I sleep. A testament of a were’s fast healing. So really I’m fine.”<br />
“Then go downstairs and help your father and brother with supper,” Martha sighing; “I got a ton of work to do and getting pulled to the new school didn’t help me in getting any of it done.”<br />
<br />
Eric just grumbles as he closes his text books; getting up and following his mother as she heads downstairs to collect her bags. A flash of light hits his peripheral vision and seconds later a loud rumble from the sky above is heard. Rapid tapping could be heard moments later as the dark sky rumbles some more.<br />
“Looks like the rain came,” Nate is heard speaking; “you think the power will go out?”<br />
“If it does,” William answering; “I got the candles placed about so we won’t be totally blind.”<br />
“I can see fine in the dark,” Eric answering as he enters the kitchen.<br />
“If the power goes out while you are doing your homework,” William responding; “you’re going to need the candles as it will be next to impossible to read in the dark.”</p>
