<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting dressed took a little time for me, and I had to struggle through a series of dizzy spells as I retrieved the clothing I had worn to see Terri the night before. Night had stood up for a moment and waited patiently by the door to the bedroom while Terri moved to put on clean clothes. Part of me was a little embarrassed at having to wear the same outfit again, as while I was no slob, I did believe that one shouldn't wear the exact same clothes two days in a row... But then, today would be an exception above all other days... and probably tomorrow as well. I tried to get up and follow Night and Terri as they moved to leave the room when Terri then moved back toward me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You rest here, John,&quot; Terri said to me, &quot;You're still recovering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am starting to feel a bit better,&quot; I protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but you won't be anywhere near one hundred percent until late this afternoon and evening,&quot; Terri answered, &quot;when your wolf is ready to come out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if Devon does come snooping around to try and protect his harem, you'll need to save your strength,&quot; Night added, &quot;Terri and I will have all we can do to help you get away... but you'll need to do a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it would come to that?&quot; I wondered as I lay back against the pillows of the bed I was in.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could, given the hair brained scheme you and Terri have cooked up,&quot; Night spoke, &quot;If he doesn't buy your lie... or if he finds out you were lying later, he will make sure you know who is the Alpha of Fangton's pack of werewolves. It's partially why I've wanted to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to say something, but as I looked up to Terri, I could see some worry on her face. She'd been rather optimistic at first, as if she figured this Devon would listen to reason. But now she seemed extremely nervous. This meant that there had to be more to Devon's actions as Fangton's Alpha Male then transforming, having sex, and possibly chasing deer or something like that. There had to be a distinctly darker side to him, that Night and Terri had previously seen. It was enough to get Terri to want to leave and now made Terri nervous when she realized that his accepting me was unlikely. And while I really wanted to hurt this guy for being with Terri, I knew I wouldn't last long against him. I'd only just been bitten.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won't be going too far,&quot; Terri promised, &quot;just to get to a phone to call him. You just rest and relax. Night and I will be back in a little bit. You just focus on recuperating.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then departed and headed out. As they did so, I tried to doze of and go back to sleep. It would allow me to relax and let enough time go by and hopefully await the night's full moon. However, sleeping was soon out when I heard a lot lot yelling come from elsewhere in the house. It sounded sorta like it was Terri, but I wasn't sure whether it was Terri or Night... but whoever was yelling sounded upset and frustrated at something. I couldn't make out what was said, but it was loud enough to keep me from sleeping. I rolled around, trying to ignore the loud argument that was echoing over the phone and through the house, but I couldn't get comfortable. Despite how under the weather I felt, I was fairly excited about the coming night. The changes it would bring for me. And that contributed to the fact that the argument wasn't about to let me get to sleep.<br />
<br />
In the course of trying to get comfortable, at one point my eyes fell on a bedside clock and I could see exactly what time it was. In doing so, my eyes opened wide when I realized the time. It was seven fifty-five! I was due to be at work in five minutes! I wasn't quite sure on what Terri's work schedule was a werewolf, but mine kept me fairly busy. It paid reasonably well and had a decent benefits package, but my boss had always been fairly strict and required an upfront call if someone was sick or was taking time off. I then began checking my pants pockets for my cellphone, paying little attention to the fact that argument outside had ceased. Eventually I got my phone out and dialed my boss's number. It rang twice before I heard someone answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; a male voice growled sounding nearly completely enraged over something.<br />
<br />
I had never known my boss's name. The paychecks I received went straight to a bank account that I had and I was low enough on the chain of command that I didn't see my boss while at work, except at maybe the occasional holiday party... but that had been from a relatively long way off, and he always seemed to be close to an incredibly hot woman that looked pretty stern herself, so I stayed away from them. I did know however to try and be as meek as possible when the boss was in a &quot;bad&quot; mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is John Will, sir,&quot; I said carefully, falling into a bit of a coughing fit after a moment, &quot;I know this... -cough--cough- sounds sudden, sir... -cough--cough- but I haven't been feeling well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calling in sick on me, eh?&quot; the man growled, sounding angry, &quot;Why? Don't you like your job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I managed, coughing again, &quot;but I'm really... -cough--cough- sick, sir. Believe me when I say that I don't like this any more then you probably do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just make sure you're in EARLY tomorrow,&quot; the voice gave a sigh, though it didn't entirely sound reassuring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, sir,&quot; I managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; the man answered, &quot;Now if you'll excuse me, I have more important things to attend to.&quot;</p>
