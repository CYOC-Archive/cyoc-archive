<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max clambered into the car in his excitement about his first day of school and his new friend &quot; and his name is Eric and he&#39;s really fun and he&#39;s a cat but that&#39;s ok can he come over tomorrow he can&#39;t today his sister has ballet but he doesn&#39;t want to go what&#39;s for dinner?&quot; &quot; Slow down there don&#39;t forget to breathe&quot; his mom looked at her son in the rear view mirror, his eyes wide with excitement. &quot; I&#39;ll call his parents and see if he can come over but not tomorrow you have a doctor&#39;s appointment. &quot;The doctor?&quot; Max whined &quot; why do I have to go to the doctor I&#39;m not sick&quot; &quot; it&#39;s for your checkup and shots sweety you don&#39;t complain about going to the dentist&quot; Max sat grumpily in the back of the car for the ride home.  <br />
        As soon as they got home Max stripped down and flopped on the couch&quot; I don&#39;t think so mister march that fluffy butt into the kitchen and start that homework I know you have some and I know you have something for me&quot; Max sighed and slowly walked to the kitchen his tail between his legs his ears hanging low&quot; do I have to&quot; &quot; yes you do get it done now so you can play later besides if you don&#39;t you have to wear clothes&quot; .<br />
     Max dragged out his backpack and gave his mom the paperwork before starting on his homework, it wasn&#39;t as bad as he thought and he was soon finished&quot; see it wasn&#39;t that bad now you can go play &quot; can I play with Sam or Darren?&quot; Not tonight sweetie it&#39;s late &quot; Max went to his bedroom&quot; ok mom&quot; <br />
        Max played with some toys in his room driving his car around making noises and crashing them into his balls&quot; crash smash the attack of the giant ball sack&quot; he giggled at the word ball sack . He kept playing until his mom came upstairs&quot;. Max dinners ready  get washed up and come down&quot;. Max got up and washed his paws before going downstairs.<br />
        He sat down at the table and his mom joined him&#39;&#39; what did you learn in school today &quot;  Max looked at her &quot; we learned about everyone in the class and math and music and stuff&quot; &quot; making plenty of friends &quot; Max nodded&quot; I met Eric and a lot few other boys I don&#39;t remember their names but we peed together in the bathroom &quot; &quot; she laughed boys will be boys I guess just remember that you can only have your penis out when you go pee you have to wear clothes at school &quot; &quot; yes mom &quot;. After dinner Max helped clean up before bath time<br />
        Under his mom&#39;s supervision he washed himself in the bathtub making sure he cleaned his sheath and balls, his mom pointing out where he needed to focus &quot; now very gently pull it out and gently scrub your penis&quot;. Max pulled his penis out and washed it &quot; I know mom &quot; can&#39;t be too careful honey you were at school all day&quot;. After bath time she let him brush his teeth by himself knowing that he could handle it.<br />
     Max rinsed his mouth out and stuck his tongue out giggling, Jeff flopped around limply drool splattering around the bathroom. Max closed his mouth and went into his bedroom and climbed under the blankets. He wiggled around enjoying the feeling of the soft fabric rubbing against his penis, he reached down and played with himself squeezing his soft penis pretending it was Andrews. He kept squeezing and rubbing his penis as his tongue slipped from his mouth dangling down on the pillow. Max fell asleep still holding his penis dreams of cum filling his head.<br />
     Max woke up the next morning his pillow case soggy with his drool, his paw loosely wrapped around his penis, he got out of bed and quickly walked into the bathroom to pee again, he accidentally got some on the floor and he knelt down and licked it up, surprised by the taste. He stood up and went downstairs for breakfast, finishing quickly so he could brush his teeth.<br />
       Max stood on the stool toothbrush in paw with his mouth wide open, he thoroughly brushed his teeth and tongue leaving a slobbery mess in the sink. Putting his toothbrush away he cleaned up his mess and got dressed and went downstairs and ran out to the front door of the car.<br />
          After a boring day at school except for some playground fun Max meet his mom in the pickup lane climbing into the car and buckling up &quot; have a good day at school&quot; Max snacked on some carrots his mom had bought for him before the doctor &quot; yeah I played with my new friend Eric&quot; &quot; that&#39;s good, I talked to his dad today do you want to go over to his house tomorrow afternoon school&quot; &quot; can i ?!&quot; &quot; Sure thing&quot;<br />
              The waiting room was full and Max and his mom had to wait almost a half hour before being brought back to the exam room. Max undressed and put on the gown before he sat down on the table nervously looking around the room. <br />
     There was a knock on the door and the doctor came in. He was an older lion streaks of silver on his fur but he was smiling&quot; hello Max I&#39;m Dr Hold and I&#39;ll be doing your checkup and shots today &quot;. He washed his paws and put on some gloves before turning to face him. He got out his stethoscope and checked Max&#39;s breathing before making some notes on a tablet. &quot; Go ahead and lie down, I&#39;m going to check on your abdomen, I&#39;m doing ok, gently press down making sure everything is where it&#39;s supposed to be&quot; . Max lied down and the doctor gently examined him, he checked his ears, eyes and nose before asking Max to stand up. &quot; Ok sport only one more thing to do, I&#39;m going to examine your genitals making sure everything is nice and healthy&quot; Max lifted the gown allowing the doctor to gently examine his sheath&quot; your doing a good job with proper hygiene do you wash yourself&quot; Max nodded &quot; yeap all by myself&quot;. <br />
        The doctor held Max&#39;s testicles in his paws and told the boy to cough &quot; I&#39;m checking for hernias now but everything looks good&quot;. Max was panting lightly, his heart racing from feeling the doctor touch him down there.&quot; Ok time for your shot and then you can get dressed&quot;. He pulled a syringe from his bag and checked the amount of liquid in it before sanitizing Max&#39;s arm. &quot; 1,2,3 he jabbed Max and pushed down on the syringe &quot; all done and not even a peep. I have grown ups who aren&#39;t as brave &quot; . He finished up and talked to Max&#39;s mom as Max got dressed.</p>
