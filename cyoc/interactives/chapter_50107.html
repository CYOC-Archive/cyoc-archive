<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will was shocked at seeing Maxine enter the kitchen,  she was much larger Maxine to him now. “Maxine…hey girl…look at how big you are…” Will said, but his voice betrayed his nervousness, making Maxine take a slightly more aggressive pose and a low growl. Normally him and Maxine were inseparable but she couldn’t recognize whom he was underneath…at least not at first. A knot formed in Will’s stomach, he was growing very afraid, he never had been even when Maxine was at her meanest. “Easy girl…it’s me, old buddy Willy.” He said pleading for her to understand him. The large German shepherd only growled louder, inching closer to Will, which only made him more nervous, he held his knees close together as they began to quake. Strangely, Will was finding himself more turned on than he’d been all day, chalking it up to just the excitement and fear of the moment messing with his head. <br />
<br />
For the life of him, he couldn’t figure out why he was so afraid of Maxine, she was the world’s biggest pushover. Yet, he stood there like a frightened child, begging the dog to heel, his face red with utter fear on the verge of tears. Will felt a small amount of moisture escape his nether-lips, his hand moved slowly to cover his crotch. Not sure of what exactly was fueling his fear or excitement, Will slowly began to back up, which again he knew was not the right move but his fright was guiding his actions. “Grrrr……” The growl was deeper than before and Will froze once again for fear of being eaten by his one time friend. “WOOF!” The dog barked loudly, causing Will to jump, he let out a girlish squeal as the dog lurched onto her hind legs, bearing down on Will’s small frame. Maxine came down on Will hard, pushing him backward as he jumped. Will felt a scratch from Maxine’s claw across his belly, hurting more because of his more sensitive skin.<br />
<br />
Later, Will realized that his feet must’ve been smaller than Eva’s, because the force of the German shepherd had pushed him easily out of the sandals. Falling to the floor, Will caught himself on his elbows to cushion the fall, landing with a thud, on his back. “Fuck!” The dog growled, thinking that his scream was meant as some kind of challenge. Will just calmly and lowered his head back slightly, almost lying completely straight. Maxine seemed to acknowledge his intent and began to sniff at the discarded footwear. The excitement of just a moment ago seemed to fade, but he still didn’t move for two reasons; one, he feared that Maxine would definitely not approve. Second, he had noticed a growing urge to go to the bathroom, which he had almost lost his control when Maxine jumped him, but he was still safe thankfully.<br />
<br />
Five minutes past with little incident, Will could only hear the sounds of Maxine chewing the sandals to pieces. Will was starting to shake with the need to use the bathroom and his anxiety wasn’t helping in the least, it was becoming nearly unbearable. Looking up slowly, he figured Maxine had plenty of time to calm down. “I’ve never seen her be so protective against anyone, let alone me.” He said lowly sitting up cautiously, bending his knees as he did. He also fixed the flimsy lace robe that had flared wide open from the fall. Maxine paid little attention to him, more interested in her new toys. The sandals were shredded already. “Five minutes, really?” He sighed, the dog’s attention once more drawn to him, the grip of fear again flooding his thoughts. <br />
<br />
Maxine sensed this taking the opportunity to stand. Creeping menacingly over to him, Maxine’s stood in front of Will, her muzzle pushed between his legs, trying to push them apart. Will was trying his best to keep them together. Her hot breath warmed the skin of Will’s under-thighs, Will feared that if he let his legs spread that he wouldn’t be able to hold back the screaming pressure from his bladder. “No…Maxine…” Will pleaded softly, not wanting to anger the dog. But he hadn't noticed Maxine snaking her way behind his clenched knees that blocked his view, until the fur from her coat tickled the back of Will’s calves. His eyes widened at a sudden odd sensation from between her legs. “Oooh…” Will found his soft voice cooing, Maxine had lapped at his panty covered pussy lips more than a few times. Because Will was not prepared for the intensely delightful feeling from Maxine’s warm tongue, his momentary relaxed state caused him to let some of the pressure in his bladder slip, though quickly recovering a good quantity managed to seep out.<br />
<br />
The warm flow of urine soaked Will’s panties thoroughly, forming a generous puddle on the tile of the kitchen floor beneath his rear. His face burned with shame, he was acting like a little girl! Afraid of a big bad doggie and peeing his panties! It was the final straw, and finally Will’s personality was able to assert itself, just as Maxine was about to again inspect his moistened sex. “MAXI!! Enough!!” The German Shepherd’s ear’s perked backward as the young woman yelled at her. In a way she also recognized the way Will called her by his personal name for her, and he was the only one that used Maxi. The dog moved a few feet away and sat obediently waiting for when she was no longer in trouble.<br />
<br />
Springing to his feet Will realized he was back in control and though he was still somewhat afraid of Maxine, he knew things were as they should be. Looking to the clock above the double stove it was ten till. “Shit, Jake will be here soon…” He felt disgusting in his soiled panties, leaving the robe in the kitchen so it wouldn’t get any of urine that was still trickling down his rear on it. Will needed to find the bathroom and get these panties off and also relieve himself. Looking back, he was about to tell Maxine to stay put, but she was already behind him a few paces behind like she was trained to do. “Good girl.” He sighed, knowing she really was just that, he didn’t blame her.  <br />
<br />
Closing the door as he walked into the bathroom, Will chuckled slightly hearing Maxine whine like always. “Crazy mutt…ooh…laughing later.” He said stripping off the wet panties, he shrugged, tossing them into the trash can, and making sure to put it somewhere in the middle of everything of the garbage. “Last thing I need is for Debbie to find those.” In a flash he was at the toilet, lifted the seat, sat and relaxed. “Finally…wonder why I was so scared of Maxi…one of a thousand question to ask that damn store owner.” He said, twisting uncomfortably in the seat, his bottom was still wet with urine. Finishing with a quick wipe, Will looked over to the shower and saw that it had one of those shower heads you could pick up and position anywhere. “Perfect…”<br />
<br />
Flushing the toilet, Will then stepped into the large tub/shower, observing that it had jets in the tub for personal water massage. A smoky glass door separated the bather from all others, Will didn’t bother to close it since he’d only be a moment. Pulling the showerhead down and turning the water on full blast, he felt it heating up under his dainty fingers, realizing for the first time just how long his nails had really become. “Hmm…I always used to keep mine so trimmed. I can’t wait to be myself again…sheesh.” <br />
<br />
Pulling the shower pin, the showerhead came to life, and Will went about the task of rinsing off the nasty feeling from his crotch, legs, thighs and butt. It didn’t take too much time and Will only had an extra five minutes from Jake’s trip home since his work was two blocks away, more if traffic was bad enough. He lingered a few moments around the lips of his vagina, the feeling from Maxine’s tongue had peaked his interest. Setting the showerhead to pulse, and aiming it directly at his tender sex. He figured he’d have a quick round of fun, after all he’d been good all day long…<br />
<br />
If it were not for the sound of the heated water hissing from the shower, Will would’ve heard the subtle commotion outside the bathroom. Will had forgotten that the maid came every other day to make sure things were tidied up. Will should’ve remembered, it had been the same maid for nearly five years, even from Jake’s old house. The forty-something housemaid was originally from Sweden and spoke almost no English even after years of being in the country. Jake spoke the language fluently and apparently she was good at her job. She was beautiful for her age or any age for that matter, and tall as a skyscraper, her name was Inga Bentzer. Her hair was almost as blonde as Will’s was now and at twice his age, she was still smoking, though she dressed mostly very demure, with a gray and white maid’s uniform. <br />
<br />
“&Auml;sch min! Vem er hem s&aring; tidigt? Motto , vem er d&auml;r inne?” Inga inquired playfully to Maxine who stood outside the bathroom door. Maxine whined slightly, her tail wagging. She had asked who was in there, obviously not really expecting an answer back. She decided to leave whomever it was alone, last thing they wanted to happen was for her to walk in on Mr. Jacob. With a smirk she inwardly admitted that she wouldn’t mind seeing him in the buff again. It was rare for Mr. Jacob or Ms. Deborah to be home so early, Inga simply reasoned it was Eva’s month to be there. She just shook her head, not really caring one way or the other. <br />
<br />
Walking down the hall with her cleaning items in hand, Inga entered the kitchen where she spotted a puddle of urine several feet from the stove. She looked sternly at Maxine who just quirked her head at the seasoned maid, she shook her finger at the dog. “D&aring;lig hund! v&auml;nta vad er den h&auml;r?” She yelled until the robe on the counter caught her attention, along with the chewed up shoes not far from the puddle. “Motto bara &auml;ta sk&ouml;n av fr&auml;mlingen…” Understanding that Maxine had a habit of chewing on the shoes of those she didn’t know, oddly telling her of an intruder. A serious look crossed Inga’s face as she turned back toward the bathroom to find out who exactly was in there.<br />
<br />
Inga held her broom tightly in her hands, slowly inching toward the door, she turned the knob slowly. Cautiously opening the door, her face stricken with shock at the sight before her. A strange young woman was using the showerhead to rinse her body down. However, she seemed to hold the showerhead to her groin and was closing her eyes lost in pleasure. The girl was beautiful that was for certain, from head to toe, she reminded Inga of herself when she had been youthful, say for the short stature. But she didn’t recognize her even slightly, she grew closer to the distracted child. Standing five feet from before yelling out in an intimidating tone in her home language. “Hej , vem er du? Vad vill du g&ouml;ra vilja? Er du den en vem kasta vatten inne om k&ouml;k?!”<br />
<br />
<br />
In an instant Will was snapped from his blissful adventure by the harsh sounding Swedish being yelled at him, he yelped slightly. His eyes popping open and into focus he saw Inga, his face glowed as bright as the sun, he dropped the showerhead, backing against the cool tiles of the wall behind him. How long had she been watching him play with himself? But that seemed the least of his problems as she continued to ask her first question repeatedly. It took Will a moment to figure out what she was asking him. “Oh…umm…my name is Wendy…Wendy…” His soft voice nervously repeated for her, but it didn’t seem to effect her demeanor. <br />
<br />
Inga pulled Will out of the shower very harshly with one arm, turning off the water as she did. Will was bewildered by her strength, she picked him up like he was a rag doll. Holding firmly around the soft flesh of Will’s frail arm, she pulled Will’s wet bottom out of the bathroom without even grabbing him a towel. Will struggled to pull free of Inga’s firm grasp, but it was no use, she just gripped tighter. “Please! I’m just a friend of the family…Jake will tell you! I promise.” The fear from Maxine was nothing like this, this woman could call the cops and lock him up, he had no I.D. nothing, not even a decent set of clothes.<br />
<br />
Inga’s eyes widened, and her face wrenched with an unprecedented rage that confused and scared Will simultaneously. “Er du Mr. Tillman's husmor? &Auml;r han lura p&aring; fattig Deborah? Du n&aring;got sortera av litten Amerikanen kalla flicka? Auktoriserat inte din moder inte krukmakare t&aring;g du?” An obvious look of disgust blanketed her face as she studied Will up and down. She positioned Will in front of the puddle of urine on the floor. Inga pulled Will harshly back to his spot as he tried to grab the robe on the counter. “Icke g&ouml;r det flytta igen whore!” Will could understand the last word and shook his head from side to side but she wouldn’t hear it, holding up her hand for him to remain silent. He felt surprisingly self-conscious in front of Inga over his nudity, his arms covered what they could but failed by far to be adequate. Still he did his best, his right arm crossed over his chest covering both mounds of bare flesh. Then covering his groin with his left hand, he kind of felt like she knew he wasn’t really a girl from her deep skeptic gaze.<br />
<br />
 With one gesture to the ground, Will knew that she wanted an explanation for the mess on the floor. Will’s eyes softened to almost tearing up, but Inga was not a softy and knew when she was being played for a fool. Also the hidden fact that she looked down upon adultery in even the slightest fashion and here before her, who Inga assumed was a harlot of Jacob’s since she’d not been informed of any visitors. Will shook his head trying to point to the dog. “I was being attacked by Maxine…and it’s hard to explain…I mean…shit…” Once again his cheeks brightened to a rosy-red at the fact that he had pissed himself and now had to explain it to her what transpired without the use of words. <br />
<br />
 Inga was tapping her foot impatiently waiting for the young girl to try and explain it to her. She knew that Maxine had a dog door and hadn’t had an accident since she was a pup. Will sighed to himself and began to reenact what led to the afternoons event while trying to maintain some monochrome of modesty in front of the older, yet attractive maid. “Okay…umm…” He pointed to Maxine and pretended to growl. “Grrr…” Will then pantomimed his walking in and freezing from the growl, followed by being pushed over and out of his sandals. Inga studied him, seeming to follow where the young girl was going with all of this. Will didn’t bother showing the dog had chewed the sandals, that was self-evident.<br />
<br />
 Thinking for a moment, Will didn’t want to actually say or act out that he’d been licked down there which had caused his involuntary release of the bladder, but he had to explain it somehow. “Okay, so I had to go really really badly.” He said, pointing to his crotch, Inga gave him a stern look. “No no, it’s not what you think!” Will said trying to figure a way for her to understand. Then he remembered how kids acted when they had to go, so he mimicked the action, mockingly holding his groin and hopped around like he had to pee. Inga nodded, pointing to the puddle like, ‘yeah, that much I know’. She ushered him to hurry his explanation along. “Okay, then Maxine…” He pointed to the dog. “WOOF!” He said loudly, Maxine stood on her paws from the sound. Will pretended like he startled himself and nodded as he completed his tale, leaving out the dog tongue, seeing it as unnecessary.<br />
 <br />
It was at that moment that the door swung open and there stood Jake with his briefcase in hand, he stared at the naked form that he knew was his trapped best friend. Jake couldn’t take his eyes off Will’s body, Will’s hands shot up to hide his nudity from his friend as he had earlier from Inga. “Now that’s the way to greet a pal after a long day of work.” He chuckled and looked to Inga, knowing she didn’t understand him. He knew something was up since Will didn’t speak for the first few moments he was there and certainly the two of them together meant nothing great for him. “Okay, so, someone tell me what the hell’s going on.” He looked down. “Is that piss on my floor?” He looked to Will who simply nodded sheepishly, reddening at the question, obviously the guilty one in the act.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will wasn’t speechless because of Inga, even though he knew she’d be yelling once he uttered the slightest syllable without her permission. He was awestruck at the way Jake looked, he was definitely taller, his chest was broader and more powerful looking. His face was that of a male model. ‘Must’ve used the vial!’ Will recognized it immediately, shrugging it off, at least it had worked properly for someone. “Listen, get me out of this, or I’ll kick your ass, I can’t believe you used the bottle! She thinks I’m a whore…I didn’t…” Will was interrupted by Inga pinching his fanny, Will moved his hands to rub it. “OW!” He squealed in a cute and very girly way, he placed his hands on his hips, staring at Inga with a childish unhappy look.<br />
<br />
Laughing a little at Will’s predicament, Jake placed his things on the kitchen/breakfast table, taking off his jacket afterward. “Well, dressed like that, who wouldn’t?” Jake said playfully, watching him stand there not even bothering to cover himself up, that gave him a thought. Just as Inga got into Jake’s face, drawing his attention back away from Will’s ample rack. “Du flytta och den kanna bara f&aring; pl&aring;gsam f&ouml;r du , barnen.” She nodded to Jake expecting him to translate. “She says you move and she’ll make this worse for you. Trust me man, I’ll handle this.” Jake shrugged as Inga pulled him by his arm into the den, which was a good fifteen feet away from the kitchen. It had large wooden double doors that could provide privacy. Will could only stand and watch as the two went out of sight, he could still hear them but it was all in Swedish. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, I know like three words…” Will shivered, feeling the still damp hair playing on his breasts, the A/C making him even more cold with his body wet from belly down. “She took the damn robe!” He said thinking he’d be able to snag it now that she was gone to get some kind of warmth, but she was clever in a twisted way. Maxine slowly strolled over to Will, Will’s hands rubbed through her thick fur, the nails giving Maxi the best scratching session of her life. They waited patiently together, he didn’t know why, he was a grown man after all, but still, Inga was more than double his existing strength, he’d be no match. It wasn’t a risk he was willing to take. “Who knows what other twisted ideas are swirling in that brain.”</p>
