<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">--Japan, a few days after Cindy&#39;s and Andy&#39;s transformations.--<br />
<br />
Natsumi, an 18-year-old Japanese girl, a few days ago returned to Japan after finishing her exchange in the United States. She cherished the time she lived with the host family who hosted her, she really felt part of the family while living with them. But she supposed that an event she considered insignificant on the day she came to Japan would change her life forever.<br />
<br />
That day, when she said goodbye to her host family, Mary, the mother of the family, became very emotional and got sick. She was already a little old, and everyone worried that it might be more serious. so everyone took her to the hospital and Natumi went with them.<br />
<br />
After confirming that Mary was fine, Josh, her husband, took Natsumi to the airport. Only as she passed the lobby she was suddenly hit by a pasty white liquid, it wasn&#39;t much and she had to run so she wouldn&#39;t miss her flight and didn&#39;t even look to see where it came from. In the car on the way to the airport, she wiped as much as she could of the liquid she believed to be milk that some child splashed into her.<br />
<br />
Now, a few days after returning home, she goes to a big event related to her favorite hobby: Tokyo Game Show. She loved a good game, especially in fighting games, and enjoyed seeing the faces of people who were surprised by her ability.<br />
<br />
The event this year had many people, including many were tourists from many other countries.<br />
<br />
Everything was going well at the event, until Natsumi started to feel sick and sat hoping to get better, she refused anyone who told her to seek help and just accepted a bottle of water someone offered her.<br />
<br />
Before long her chest started to hurt and she realized that for some reason her bra was too tight, she went to try to fix it, but kept getting tighter and tighter until she couldn&#39;t stand the pressure and her bra snapped. She couldn&#39;t believe her breasts had grown so fast and so fast, until each one reached the size of a watermelon. For a moment her shirt did not tear, but it was too tight on her.<br />
<br />
Then her neck changed, getting much thicker and longer, it made her shirt finally give way and tear. When she looked at her bust, she was startled to see her nipples disappeared, she then felt her breasts, but the texture was very different and there was something inside. Despite the bizarre situation, she recognized the texture by some men she had been with and said out loud &quot;No way, I have testicles inside my breasts.&quot; She was so shocked by what was happening to her that she forgot she was in a crowded place that watched her transformation in horror.<br />
<br />
In a moment her neck started to get hard, forcing her to look up, she became desperate and began to touch her neck, which conveyed sensations she had never had before. Then she felt something was going up her neck and she finally understanding what happened said &quot;But what the hell happened, I turned into a huge penis.&quot; Then she came, her fucking mouth coming out and hitting several people around her who, when they realized what had happened, was too late to escape. As soon as her orgasm ended, Natsumi passed out where she was.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
--A few weeks later in the mutant city-<br />
<br />
Carl came home very tired, he immediately sat in a chair and looked very tired and discouraged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, what&#39;s the matter? You don&#39;t look well.&quot; Abby asked<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem is this report I received today.&quot; Carl said and put a document on the table,<br />
<br />
Abby read its contents and he was mentioning a girl who changed in Japan. &quot;And what&#39;s the matter with this?&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem is that the infection had to be controlled and there was no way out of the country, so it&#39;s strange that it has been so far infected. Worse, according to her statement, we learned that she had been in the United States until shortly before she was transformed into an exchange, that she was in a hospital helping an acquaintance before she left, and that they had spilled milk on her as she left the hospital.&quot; he said &quot;As the time went by and what was the hospital in question I found out she was present when I turned and was one of the people hit by my cum, which means I infected her.&quot; he completed<br />
<br />
Reading the rest of the document, Abby understood Carl&#39;s concern, as Natsumi had turned into tourists from many countries, and now they had reports of mutations occurring worldwide.</p>
