<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door handle jiggled down, and the door flung open as Steve’s body crashed through it, landing on his side just inches inside of the entryway to his apartment.<br />
<br />
“I did it…” Steve panted as his muscles relaxed, the pain receded, and he felt his cervix firming back up.  “I’m not going into labor…”<br />
<br />
That mantra had served him well but, still, Steve knew exactly how close he’d come.  Closing his eyes, he took a well-deserved rest that even the app couldn’t deny him.  That thought… man… Steve laughed at how stupid it was.  Of course, the app could deny it to him.  The app could deny him a great many things but, for whatever reason, it simply chose not to for moment.<br />
<br />
Laying on the floor, Steve just drifted in darkness as his heart pounded and thing in his belly twisted and turned inside of him.  He wasn’t sure how long it had been, but he eventually felt the return of what little strength this breeding slave’s body had.  Opening his eyes, he rolled back to his hands and knees, picked up his phone, and then crawled into his computer room.<br />
<br />
His wireless charger was sitting on the side of his desk, and plopping the phone on top of it was simple enough – even from his position on the floor.  Once that was done, Steve found himself confronted with another challenge. <br />
<br />
Something told him that he’d be able to use his computer to discover more about his current condition.  Maybe he could look up the app on the boogle?  It stood to reason that someone else had found this app and posted about it.  He didn’t know he would read it, but still.<br />
<br />
Or maybe the app had downloaded itself to the computer and had an interface that was more readable for…  Steve sighed; he didn’t want to admit it but there was no point in dancing around the subject.  Maybe the app had an interface for someone with his body’s limited slave intellect.  He didn’t know why he needed to get onto the computer, he just knew that he had to.  But how to get into his chair when he couldn’t stand?<br />
<br />
At first he tried backing into it, as though his butt would just naturally scoot into the seat and all he’s have to do was lean back.  The feeling of the top of his tail pressing into the bottom of the chair made it quickly apparent how pointless that was.  He wasn’t sure if his old body was even tall enough to do that, and his new one certainly wasn’t.<br />
<br />
The other obvious option was to use his desk to try to pull himself up.  The desk itself was made out of sturdy wood, so he had no doubt that it would be able to support his weight.  The real question was whether he had the strength to do it.<br />
<br />
Placing his right arm on the desk, he managed to get his elbow on top of it, followed by the same thing with his left arm.  Pulling down, he was able to bring his body into a position where he was using his arms to hold his body upright while he sat with his shins below him.<br />
<br />
Looking down at his breasts he got another idea.  This wasn’t going to be the most pleasant thing but… he heaved up with arms and legs, lifting his first row of breasts above the desk, before pushing himself forward.  His lower two pairs of breasts squished painfully against the wooded side, and he could feel small trails of milk begin to run into his fur.  But his top pair of breasts, the one that he’d gotten above desk, landed on top of it.<br />
<br />
He could feel the wood cutting into the bottom of the breasts, but despite the discomfort, they managed to hold his body up.  Another heave and he got his middle pair of now dripping breasts on top of the desk, splattering small droplets of milk along the edge.  One last heave and… his belly painfully impacted against the bottom of the desk, and he came crashing back onto his middle pair of breasts.<br />
<br />
This was as high as he could go, but was it enough?  He moved his tail towards the chair and felt it into the seat in a way that told him that the seat was slightly lower than his skunky butt.  Pulling the chair towards him, he pushed his butt up and back, feeling it touch the edge of the seat.<br />
<br />
With one last heave he pushed himself up and off the desk, threading his tail underneath the seat’s backrest as the remainder of his body came to rest in the seat itself.<br />
<br />
He’d always driven his car with his seat in a slightly reclined position, and it wasn’t until he found himself sitting upright in his desk chair that he realized just how uncomfortable that position was in his new body.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of jiggly, fluid-filled objects hanging off the front of his body and, when he was sitting upright, gravity had a way of painfully reminding him of their existence.  Unlatching the backrest, Steve leaned back until his upper body was at a near 45 degree angle and he had managed to lift his legs on top of his desk.  It wasn’t a dignified position – in fact it was a position distinctly designed to ease the burden of giving birth – but it was the position he now found himself in.<br />
<br />
Steve wasn’t going to pretend that this was comfortable.  His breasts ached, his back hurt, his cunt was sore, his body was exhausted, and the pressure in his womb was as unrelenting as the squirming creature that filled it.  But for everything he’d been through today, leaning back in the chair like this was as close to comfortable as this painfully pregnant body was going to get.</p>
