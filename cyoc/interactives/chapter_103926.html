<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trailer rattled and groaned with each bump it hit in the road and the shrill whistle of air whisking through the openings was incessant. Sarah flicked her ears nervously every time it the trailer bounced or wobbled, wondering how horses tolerated this. Just twenty minutes into the trailer ride and she was already anxious for it to be over.<br />
<br />
She tried to munch on the hay in the trough in front of her, but the sense of being enclosed in this giant metal box made her feel extremely uneasy and food was the last thing on her mind. The fact that it was hay instead of a nice salad didn’t help much either. Sarah knew she’d probably have to get used to it before long, but her human side still protested to giving in and eating hay or grass, no matter how good it smelled. <br />
<br />
After what felt like an eternity, Sarah felt the distinctive rumble grind over the trailer as it crossed a cattle guard and then started jarring over a dirt road. Within a few minutes, the trailer jolted to a stop, catching her a bit off guard, and the diesel pickup’s engine was shut off. They were finally here.<br />
<br />
“Nice to see you again!”<br />
<br />
“Same here. It’s been too long.”<br />
<br />
Sarah flicked her ears and shifted uncomfortably on her hooves. She could hear Michelle talking to a new person outside she guessed must be Tracie, but was a bit unnerved that her friend hadn’t let her out of this god forsaken trailer yet. Tracie’s muffled voice rattled over the trailer’s shell again. <br />
<br />
“So what have you got for me again?”<br />
<br />
“It’s one of my friend’s horses. A bay Hanoverian. About three years old by the looks of her. She’s never been shod, and goes by the name of Sahara.”<br />
<br />
Sarah nickered and twitched her tail at the name. It was one she’d come up with before Michelle drove her over here. She knew it didn’t really fit her, or her new equine body, but it was the closest thing she could think of to Sarah that still sounded like the name for a horse. <br />
<br />
“Sahara, huh?” Tracie mused. “Interesting name. How’s the girl’s temperament?”<br />
<br />
Michelle hesitated for a second. “Her temperament? Um, fine, I think. Actually, I haven’t had her long enough to know. I kept her away from my horses when my friend brought her over here earlier today, just in case, but from what my friend tells me, she’s pretty well behaved. It’s like I told you over the phone, though, my friend just kind of put in charge of her while she went off to look for a new job and I really don’t have the time to take on another horse right now. It’s not too much trouble for you, is it?”<br />
<br />
“No. It’s no big deal. We’ve already got eleven, so I don’t think one more’s going to hurt us too much for a bit. Is she saddle broken?”<br />
<br />
“No,” was the prompt response from Michelle. Even from inside the trailer, Sarah could tell that caught Tracie’s attention.<br />
<br />
“I mean, my friend’s just never had the time to, you know, actually ride her yet. Too busy with work. She’s mostly kept Sar, um, Sahara out in the pasture most of the day.”<br />
<br />
“She must be a spoiled horse, then,” Tracie scoffed.<br />
<br />
“You could probably say that,” Michelle added. “Anyway, let me get her out for you. Um, would you mind getting the back door? I’ll push her out.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Tracie said dryly.<br />
<br />
A split second later, Sarah’s ears flicked forward when the door on the side of the trailer clicked and winced her right eye as brilliant white light streamed in. Behind her, she was aware of the rear doors being opened up. She watched as Michelle stepped up next to her. <br />
<br />
“Okay, Sahara. Ready to see your temporary home?” Michelle said as she unclipped the lead rope. Before pushing Sarah back, she leaned in close and whispered, “Remember to act like a horse as much as possible here.”<br />
<br />
Sarah only gave a short nicker in response and started backing out. It was much more disorienting than going in, but, eventually, she managed to get her rear legs off the trailer and then her front legs. As soon as she was out, she could see a squat woman with graying hair and thin glasses smiling back at her and giving her an assessing sort of look. It was a bit unsettling, and caused Sarah to flick her tail a few times. It only got worse when Tracie, who smelt strongly of horse and old woman, stepped over and ran her hand over her rump before patting it a few times.<br />
<br />
For a second, Sarah started wishing she’d made Michelle suck it up and take care of her as a pet at her house for a few days until they found the horse that did this to her. As awkward as having her friend treat her as a pet would have been, Sarah knew this was way worse.<br />
<br />
“Boy, she’s a pretty one isn’t she?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Michelle affirmed a bit insincerely, trying to ignore the way Tracie had just run her hand over her friend. “She is that. So, where do I take her?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah,” Tracie exclaimed, taking her hand off of Sarah. Jerking her thumb behind her, she said, “Just lead her over to the south paddock. That’s where I keep the other mares. Hopefully they’ll get along with her.”<br />
<br />
“Let me know if they don’t,” Michelle said. “I’ll come and get her if I have to. Even if I’m at school.”<br />
<br />
Tracie smirked and Sarah couldn’t help herself from brushing the end of her muzzle against Michelle’s cheek. It was the closest thing she could come to a hug without saying anything.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t realize taking care of this horse was so important to you.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it is for a good friend,” Michelle said.<br />
<br />
A few steps later, and Tracie unlocked the paddock fence and opened it up enough for Michelle to guide Sarah through. Her equine heart thumped hard as soon as she stepped off the dirt pathway and onto the grass of the paddock. She really was in a horse enclosure, as a horse, now. She could see the other occupants all staring back at her and the human that led her in. More than that, though, Sarah caught wind of their scents and the scent of her new home.<br />
<br />
She was only dimly aware of Michelle taking the halter off and patting her on the neck before she leaned in and whispered. “Good luck. I’ll do my best to find the horse that put you in this position.”<br />
<br />
And with that, Michelle choked back tears and left Sarah in the paddock.</p>
