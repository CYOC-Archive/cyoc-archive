<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even though Michael had gone to bed early the night before, he had overslept this morning and didn’t see a group of urgent messages from Diya on his phone when he should have. At around 10 in the morning, he stirred from his sleep and slowly got himself up to check on it. When he turned it on, it immediately woke him up from his still groggy state with the series of messages from Diya beaming at him.<br />
<br />
“Michael! Urgent! Text me back now!<br />
“Michael! U R N DANGER! GET OUT NOW!”<br />
“MICHAEL?! Y DONT U ANSWER?!”<br />
<br />
Feeling a sense of panic, Michael picked up his phone and called Diya to speak to her. <br />
<br />
“Diya?” Michael asked, with alarm in his tone. “What’s up with the messages? Is everything alright?”<br />
<br />
“Michael!” Diya screamed from the other end of the phone. “You have to get out of there now! I’ve been listening in to the bug lines this morning and the wizard, Sofya’s father, is out to go find Daniel. When he finds out that he doesn&#39;t have the ring, he’s going to come to your house to try to take it! Get out of there now before he comes finding you!”<br />
<br />
“Diya, I can’t leave. My parents….”<br />
<br />
“Michael! It’s urgent! You have to get out of there now! He may already be on his way!”<br />
<br />
“Diya, I’m grounded….”<br />
<br />
“Michael! I’m serious! Get out of there now! Find some sort of way out of there! You can&#39;t stay behind! You have to go!”<br />
<br />
Feeling a sense of panic wash over him, Michael agreed with her reluctantly and hung up the phone. He opened up his computer to check out the bug line and could see noise spikes on the audio feed from the living room. When he put on his headphones and turned to the channel to listen to it, he could hear…<br />
<br />
“Let’s get the cum out of that beautiful dick of yours” he could hear Sofya say to Fido. “You know you want to.”<br />
<br />
“No!” Michael screamed loudly, as he slammed his computer shut, took off his headphones and ran out of his bedroom. <br />
<br />
Michael didn’t take any time to put on new clothes or shower. He bolted out of his room and made his way downstairs to see his parents sitting in the living room. <br />
<br />
“Michael?” his mother called to him, nervously. “You’re up late this morning.”<br />
<br />
“Where do you think you’re off to?” his father asked. “You’re still grounded for the week.”<br />
<br />
“Dad!” Michael yelled, as he continued to make his way to the door. “I have to get out of here! Freddy is in danger!”<br />
<br />
“No!”<br />
<br />
“Honey” his mother added, trying to reassure him. “I’m sure that if Freddy is in danger, you could call the police and have them take care of it.”<br />
<br />
“But mom!” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“Michael!” his father barked at him. “You’re not to leave this house! That&#39;s an order!”<br />
<br />
“But I have to!”<br />
<br />
“Honey” his mother called to him again, softly.<br />
<br />
A struggle ensued, as Michael tried to open the front door, while his father grabbed him from behind to try to pull him away. His mother was screaming and hitting her husband, as they all writhed in an aggressive tussle. Despite his father’s overwhelming strength, Michael managed to pry himself free from his grasp long enough to open the door and run outside as fast as he could; notably with no shoes and socks on.<br />
<br />
“Michael!” his father’s voice boomed from inside the house. “Get back in here right now!”<br />
<br />
Michael stopped and turned to his father briefly, looking at him with a tear rolling down his cheek. After a brief pause, he flipped him the middle finger and then ran off into the street to head to Sofya’s house. <br />
<br />
“Michael!&quot; his father&#39;s voice continued to boom across the block. &quot;You’re grounded for two weeks now! And you can forget me having that father son time with that fag boyfriend of yours!”<br />
<br />
Michael’s mother slapped her husband aggressively. He rubbed his cheek, as she stared at him with anger strewn across her face. <br />
<br />
“Honey” he calmly said to her. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to say that. I just….”<br />
<br />
“Save it, Ralph” she replied sternly. “And you wonder why you need to see a therapist tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“But honey, aren’t you going to go after him? Shouldn’t we be going after him? He’s grounded. He’s….”<br />
<br />
Before he could say another word, Michael’s mother stormed off into the kitchen. His father could only stare at the now vacant street before him. Though he was seething on the inside, it was hopeless to try to go after him now. After all, he had no idea where he’d be running off to and finding him would be an impossible task. Instead, he quietly closed the door and sat back down on the couch in the living room. He would have a long talk with his son when he got back. That is, if he’d remember to do it. <br />
<br />
Sprinting down the street with pain from his bare feet stemming from the gravely sidewalk below, Michael ran as fast as he could to Sofya’s house. He couldn’t believe that Freddy had allowed himself to succumb to Sofya’s advances yet again. He thought, and hoped, that Freddy would resist her temptations long enough to get conclusive evidence on tape to send the wizard to prison forever. Unfortunately, that wasn’t meant to be and he damned Freddy for it. He damned him for his lack of impulse control. He wondered whether Freddy still loved him.<br />
<br />
Feelings of anger were pushed aside for the moment, as Michael made way to Sofya’s house and proceeded to the front door. Hoping that she had forgotten to lock her doors again, Michael was able to swing them open with ease. He looked in the entry way to see Sofya on the floor of the living room, with an exhausted Fido standing in place. Michael could see that Sofya had dog cum all over her face, as she looked up at him with a sense of surprise.<br />
<br />
“Michael” she called to him sternly. “What the fuck are you doing here? God damn it, you can’t just barge into people’s places like this.”<br />
<br />
“Sofya” Michael replied, as he started to sob. “What did you do to Fido?”<br />
<br />
Sofya looked to Fido, as the dog’s face was completely paralyzed. If he could move his facial features right now, Fido would be growling at her aggressively. <br />
<br />
“Oh him?” she replied mischievously, as she got up to face Michael. “I was just playing with the dog, that’s all. No need to be alarmed.”<br />
<br />
“You masturbated the dog and have his load all over your face” he replied in disgust. <br />
<br />
“It’s not a big deal, Michael. The dog’s junk was maintained and I had never tried dog cum before. I figured I would jack him off. Give him some pleasure, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
Sofya licked her face, but gave a sore facial expression as a result. <br />
<br />
“Not the best tasting thing I’ve ever had” she continued. “But it was still a fun experience.”<br />
<br />
After a moments silence, while Michael glared at her, a thought came into Sofya’s head. <br />
<br />
“Wait a second, why am I even entertaining this?”<br />
<br />
She composed herself, before she spoke again.<br />
<br />
“But enough about that. Why did you barge into my house yet again, Michael? That’s trespassing and I have it on good authority to call the police right now.”<br />
<br />
“Because I knew you were doing something with the dog” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“Huh? How did you even know that? Are you spying on me?”<br />
<br />
“Uh….”<br />
<br />
Before Michael could respond, he and Sofya could hear a soft moaning. The two of them turned to see Fido mutating and shifting into a more human stance. Fur receded into his skin quickly, as the body before them morphed back into a naked Freddy, on his hands and knees, moaning in embarrassment. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God” Sofya said, as she put her hand to her mouth. “What the hell? Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“Oh God” Michael said quietly under his breath. <br />
<br />
After a few more moans were released, Freddy got up from his hands and knees position and stood up on two legs once again. He rubbed his head briefly, as the paralysis spray began to wear off. <br />
<br />
“Man” he said, as he shook his head softly. “That paralysis spray sure did a number on me.”<br />
<br />
Noticing his nude appearance, Freddy looked to Michael and Sofya, as he quickly covered his genitals. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” Freddy exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“Freddy?” Sofya asked. “Why are you naked in my house? And where’s Fido?”<br />
<br />
“Sofya” he replied. “Let me explain.”<br />
<br />
“He’s the dog, Sofya” Michael interjected. <br />
<br />
Sofya looked to Michael, with a confused look on her face. <br />
<br />
“Freddy is Fido” he continued. <br />
<br />
“But how?” she asked. <br />
<br />
“It’s a long story, which we don’t have time to tell you. Sofya, we’re all in great danger. Your father is a wizard who is trying to steal these rings that belong to an Italian Museum in Rome. We need to stop him before he is able to steal the rest of them.”<br />
<br />
“Aha!” Sofya exclaimed, as she pointed at Michael accusingly. “I was right. You did have one of those rings!”<br />
<br />
“Yes Sofya” Freddy replied to her meekly. “But your father stole the ones he has. They aren’t his. He’s a thief and makes his living stealing magical antiques and selling them on the black market.”<br />
<br />
“He’s trying to get his hands on the ring we were given” Michael added. “We were chosen by an old man in a magic shop to help end your father’s life of crime. That’s why the curse of the ring effects Freddy. He stupidly read the inscription aloud and starts turning into a dog whenever he gets turned on.”<br />
<br />
“So then he is bi” Sofya said, with a bit of a smirk on her face. <br />
<br />
Unsure of how to respond, Freddy looked down at the floor, as he blushed uncontrollably. <br />
<br />
“And that explains why you ran off of me when we made out” she continued, as she turned to look at him accusingly. “It was because you were turning into a dog, wasn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded, as Michael looked to him angrily. <br />
<br />
&quot;That explains that weird hairy feeling I was getting from your body before you got off of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two boys nodded.<br />
<br />
“And that explains why Fido suddenly appeared in the bushes next to my house” she added, as she turned to look at a seething Michael.<br />
<br />
“Yes Sofya” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“And it explains why you guys have been absent from school and why Fido, I mean Freddy, bit Daniel’s arm yesterday. And why he was barking so loudly in defense of you as a dog, Michael, and how he know what I was saying about you during our conversation in my house. It’s because Fido is Freddy.”<br />
<br />
The two boys nodded again, as Michael continued to seethe while Freddy looked down at the floor feeling an extreme sense of humiliation. <br />
<br />
“But if that’s true&quot; she continued &quot;then how are you, Michael, aware of the fact that I was um….”<br />
<br />
Sofya turned to Freddy and then looked back at Michael nervously.<br />
<br />
“How did you know I was jacking him off just now?”<br />
<br />
“Because” Michael replied “I’ve been listening in to your house since I came over yesterday. I bugged your house and have recorded the conversations your father has been having with you about his desire to take the ring I possess.”<br />
<br />
Michael went over to the painting in the living room and pulled the bug off from behind it. He showed it to Sofya, as she looked at it curiously.<br />
<br />
“These bugs” he continued “are the most sophisticated in the world. They can record just about anything with crystal clear quality. We have confessions from your father on tape. I have other rooms in your house bugged as well.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God” Sofya said quietly, unsure of how to feel in the moment. <br />
<br />
“Sofya” Freddy said to her, as she turned to look at him. “We don’t have a lot of time. We’re all in big danger. Your father is probably going to come back here soon and….”<br />
<br />
“That’s quite enough” a voice called to them sternly. <br />
<br />
The three teenagers turned to the still open front door to see…….</p>
