<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>After lunch, Danielle decided to hit
the bathroom before her next class. She
wasn't especially pleased when Kat
followed her, but her now-twin sister just
stood in front of the mirror, apparently
touching up her makeup or something -
Danielle didn't know. At least they were
the only ones in there - that meant nobody
to tease them.</p>
<p>When she'd finished her business,
Danielle exited the stall to see Kat
standing there, a wicked grin on her face.
She gasped and looked for an exit, but Kat
was positioned directly between her and
the door. There was nobody here and
nowhere to run.</p>
<p>"I'm not losing this easily, Danny,"
Kat smirked. She opened her hand to reveal
a small stone, like a rainbow-colored
pearl. "If you'd been <i>born</i> a girl,
if you'd had the same witch training Mom
gave me, you'd know what this is. It's a
caster battery, infused with magical
energy. I don't have to be eighteen to tap
into existing energy - I already
<i>know</i> how!"</p>
<p>Danielle began to tremble.
"But...but...what are...?"</p>
<p>Kat's sneer intensified. "I can't make
Mom lift her spell on me, but I'm damn
well not gonna let you go unpunished for
tattling. We'll see how you like being a
full rabbit until Mom changes me back!"
She gestured at Danielle, who felt a surge
of magical energy.</p>
<p>Danielle expected panic to set in as
the world began tomgrow around her, but
all she felt was a growing knot in her
stomach. She wondered how much worse
everything could get when suddenly Kat let
out a yelp. Danielle looked at her sister
and gasped - Kat was shrinking too!</p>
<p>"<i>No!</i>" she shrieked. "Mom used a
mirror-magic spell!? I should've been able
to tell! No, no, <i>no!</i> I don't
<i>want</i> to be a rabbit!!!"</p>
<p>Much to her horror, Danielle felt a
prickling sensation all over her skin. She
clutched herself, Kat mirroring her
actions, as snow-white fur spread across
her whole body, making a sharp contrast
with her firey red hair. Pink pads formed
on the insides of her hands as her
fingernails turned into short claws. She
could feel her legs changing, her feet
becoming slightly more animalistic,
altering her stance. Danielle cringed,
sure that it was only moments before she
was forced down on all fours...</p>
<p>...and it stopped. All of a sudden, it
was gone. She didn't know or care why; she
was just grateful it was over, for the
moment. Danielle turned to the mirror to
see what had happened.</p>
<p>Her first shock was the sheer change in
size. She had gone from around 4'6" to no
more than three feet tall, a mere
two-thirds of the size she had been.
She could barely see herself in the
mirror, and most of what she saw only
confirmed what she already knew: she'd
gone from being a mostly-human girl with
bunny ears and a tail to being an
anthropomorphic rabbit-girl.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, though, underneath the
fur, her facial structure was basically
unchanged - she hadn't developed a muzzle
or anything like that. And although she'd
shrunk, she was still proportioned like a
budding thirteen-year-old girl, just
smaller - which would've been a bigger
comfort if A. she was supposed to be a
girl at all, and B. it didn't imply that
this two-thirds size thing was a feature
of her new form rather than just a loss in
growth.</p>
<p>Kat, now identically transformed, was
sputtering angrily and incoherently as
Danielle turned to face her.
"Stupid...dammit...why can't...should
work! Argh! Why can't I-"</p>
<p>She was cut short as Danielle
sucker-punched her. Kat didn't fall over,
but she was knocked off-balance, and the
stone went flying as she tried to keep
from falling. She recovered and launched
herself at Danielle, who tried to dodge
but only got half out of the way. Kat
struck her in the shoulder and dragged her
brother-turned-sister to the floor with
her.</p>
<p>"I have had <i>ENOUGH!</i>" Danielle
barked, as the two struggled. "I don't
care <i>what</i> you do to me, I'm
<i>NOT</i> just going to sit and take
this!" She tried to claw at Kat, but her
sister grabbed her ear and yanked.
Danielle was unused to having such a
prominent grab-point, and shrieked more
out of surprise than pain. She was about
to retaliate when a shout of
"<i><b>GIRLS!!!</b></i>" interrupted them.
Both of them knew what that tone in that
voice meant, and they froze in
mid-attack.</p>
<p>There, standing by the bathroom door,
was their mother. The room around them
took on a faintly jittery appearance, like
the pause on a cheap VCR - Kat knew this
meant their mother had frozen time around
them, to avoid interlopers.</p>
<p>"Get off of each other this
<i>instant!</i>" she snapped. "I don't
care who did what, you <i>both</i> know
better than this!" She turned to Kat. "And
you, Catherine Louise...I wish I could say
I'm surprised, but I'm really not. One
taste of power and you go completely ape.
I guess there's just too much of your aunt
in you."</p>
<p>Danielle looked confused. "We have an
aunt?" Her mother sighed, sadly. "I'll
explain another time, dear. For now...dear
God, what happened here?"</p>
<p>"Kat had a battery stone or something,
and she used it to do this!" Danielle
said, choking up as she recalled her
terror. "She was going to turn me into a
full rabbit!"</p>
<p>Her mother slapped a palm to her
forehead. "Kat...<i>tell</i> me you
didn't use some cheap, street-vendor
piece of..."</p>
<p>"I don't see what the big deal is!" Kat
snapped. "You took away my power, so I
used an enchanter's reserve for power!
Duh!"</p>
<p>Their mother groaned. "Dammit, Kat,
after everything I taught you about
interaction of magics, you go and pull a
stunt like that? Did you just
<i>forget</i> that enchanter's-reserve
stones are imprinted with the spell
pattern of the manufacturer, or were you
even listening in the <i>first</i>
place?"</p>
<p>Kat gasped, and her mother nodded.
"Yes, now you understand, don't you? We're
going to have to track down the
manufacturer of that stone and pray that
he's skilled enough to lift this spell
without disturbing the spells on either of
you." She leaned down close to Kat's face.
"And you already might never get your
magic back, young lady, but if you've left
your brother stuck as a rabbit-girl for
the rest of her life, I <i>swear</i> you
will be starting over from
<i>kindergarten.</i>"</p></p>
