<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that afternoon, Tom asked his mother if Jim could sleep over. She said, “Yes,” and Jim called home to let his parents know. The two of them had agreed to target Tom’s brother, Rick, first. They were already at Tom’s house. They figured, why not start there?<br />
<br />
Sitting together in the tree house, they plotted their scheme for getting back at Rick.<br />
<br />
“Why are we doing this again?” asked Jim. “I mean, I know you two don’t like each other much, but I don’t remember you saying what it was that Rick did to piss you off. It must have been bad to want to transform him to get revenge.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t really want to talk about it,” Tom said and turned away looking a bit embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” said Jim. “But, you know you can tell me anything. You can trust me, man.”<br />
<br />
Tom looked at Jim and nodded as though he had decided it was safe to share a secret with him. “Do you remember how a couple of years ago a rumor went around that I wet my bed?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Guess who started that rumor.”<br />
<br />
“Rick?” said Jim, surprised. “Why would he do that?”<br />
<br />
“I caught him smoking, and I told my parents about it. They grounded him, of course.”<br />
<br />
“Why’d you tell you parents?”<br />
<br />
“I was pissed at him for some reason. I don’t even remember anymore what it was. Well, after he was grounded, he decided to take his revenge on me.” He paused briefly, recalling the pain that followed. “He started telling people that I wet the bed every other night. Word got around school about it, and it was months before they stopped picking on me for it.”<br />
<br />
“I remember that,” said Jim. “I always stuck by your side.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” said Tom, appreciatively. “You were one of the good ones.”<br />
<br />
“So that’s it then?”<br />
<br />
“Not completely. Last month just after his sixteenth birthday I caught Tom and his girlfriend smoking a joint in the woods.”<br />
<br />
“Uh oh.”<br />
<br />
“He saw me too,” said Tom. “I’m not dumb. I told him I would keep it a secret. I didn’t want any trouble like when I caught him smoking. He didn’t seem to trust me, but he let it go then. A couple of days later I came home and found him in my room sitting on my bed, smiling.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not good.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I was worried. He said, ‘Tom, I want to share a little something with you.’ He held up his iPhone and showed me a picture. It was me. Well, it was my head. From the neck down, it was the body of some naked girl. She looked like she was about 10 or something, no hair yet anywhere down there. You could even see her…” he paused “…stuff between her legs.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa. Where’d he get that?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know for sure, but I think his girlfriend must have made it. She’s takes a bunch of art classes. She sucks at drawing, but she knows how to use Photoshop. It bet that it was a picture of her own body from when she was a kid that she used to replace my body. The Photoshop even looked believable. I mean, the proportions were right, and she even matched the skin tone. If I didn’t know better, I could believe that it was a picture of some naked girl.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, man,” said Jim. “What’d you do?”<br />
<br />
“What could I do? I pleaded with him to erase it. He just laughed at me. He told me that he might think about erasing it if I was willing to do a few things for him in return. And if I didn’t, it might just end up on the Internet somewhere. What could I do? I’d die of embarrassment if anyone saw that. Imagine the kind of hell I’d have to go through if that picture went around the school. I’ve only just started to get past the bedwetting rumors. This picture would probably ruin my life all the way through high school.”<br />
<br />
Jim silently considered the possible hells that kids could come up with to torture someone. “What did he ask you to do for him?”<br />
<br />
“Be his slave, basically,” said Tom. “Of course, I can’t tell on him about any rules he breaks, like I would ever think about doing that again. I have to make his bed every day. I have to clean his room every week. I have to give him most of my allowance, probably uses it to buy drugs. If Mom and Dad aren’t home, and he’s supposed to be watching me, I have to make food for him and his girlfriend, while they poke fun at me. They started calling me Tina the Ballerina. She even made me wear a tutu once.”<br />
<br />
Jim stifled a laugh, but Tom heard it. “Sorry,” Jim apologized.<br />
<br />
“So,” said Tom. “That’s why I’m doing this. I want to get my life back. If I have something embarrassing about him to threaten him with that’s even worse than what he has on me, then I’ll be free again. He won’t be able to push me around or blackmail me anymore.”<br />
<br />
Jim nodded. “Hell yeah, man. Let’s get that prick. So, what do you want to do to him?”<br />
<br />
Tom smiled. “I have an idea. If it works, then I should be able to get back at him as well as his girlfriend, indirectly at least.”<br />
<br />
Jim smiled. “Let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
That evening Tom’s parents ordered pizza. Jim and Tom were left alone in the den to eat, watch TV, and chat for a few hours. Rick came home late. His parents asked him where he was at, but all he said was “Judy,” his girlfriend’s name, and walked away to grab some cold pizza. Jim watched with dread as Rick entered the den with a box of cold pizza. He was dressed in mostly black and smelled faintly like smoke and beer.<br />
<br />
“Well, hello there,” said Rick when he saw Jim and Tom. “So, Tina, is this your new boyfriend?”<br />
<br />
Tom sighed. “This is Jim. We’ve been friends for years. You know him.”<br />
<br />
Rick set down the pizza box on the floor and grabbed the TV remote from Tom. “Move your ass,” he said to Tom, not in a mean way, but you could tell he would get mean if you didn’t comply. Tom stood up and Rick took his seat. “Since you two are so close, why don’t you continue your cuddle fest upstairs?”<br />
<br />
Tom gestured to Jim to come with him, and they left Rick alone in the den. When he was confident that Rick was out of earshot, Jim whispered, “What a dick.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t agree more,” said Tom.<br />
<br />
They holed up in Tom’s room for about an hour before they heard Rick walking down the hallway. His footsteps stopped in front of Tom’s door, which flung open suddenly.<br />
<br />
“Aw,” said Rick with mock disappointment. “I thought I might catch you two making out in here.”<br />
<br />
“What do you want?” said Tom.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” said Rick. “Just wanted to say, ‘goodnight.’ I’m going to rub one out in a bit, so try to keep quiet in here. I don’t like to be distracted when I’m looking at porn. Ruins the mood.”<br />
<br />
Jim felt disgusted, and it showed on his face, but Tom was all too used to these kinds of announcements. He stared back at Rick, defiantly.<br />
<br />
“Sleep tight,” Rick said and left without closing the door. Tom walked over and shut the door. It took a great deal of self control to keep from slamming it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s so gross,” said Jim. “I can’t believe he just said that.”<br />
<br />
“Shh,” said Tom, quietly. “His room’s just on the other side of the wall.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, that’s sick, dude,” Jim whispered.<br />
<br />
“I’ve gotten used to his little announcements,” said Tom, grimly, but then he smiled. “But, that should be the last time I have to hear about it from him.”<br />
<br />
Jim smiled. “Yeah, he won’t be talking about that anymore after we’re done with him.”<br />
<br />
“Ready?” asked Tom.<br />
<br />
Jim pulled out the balloon and handed it to Tom. “You can do the honors. He’s your target.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” he said. Tom held the balloon and smiled. “This should be fun,” he said and began to cast the spell.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Rick had just settled in at his desk. The door was locked. He had his lotion and tissues ready to go. His computer was on, and already he was searching through his many hidden folders of pornography for just the right girl. He never told his girlfriend about his masturbating every night. Sure, Judy was cute and loved a good fuck, but Rick craved a bit of variety. This was his special alone time.<br />
<br />
Rick found his girl, and the fantasy began. Almost immediately, he felt a tingle in his crotch. It bothered him briefly. Of course, feeling tingles in his crotch was the whole point of what he was doing, but this one felt different. He ignored it, though.<br />
<br />
He started to rub himself hard and felt that strange tingle again as he stiffened up. When he looked away from the screen to check on his dick, he gasped.<br />
<br />
His dick had…</p>
