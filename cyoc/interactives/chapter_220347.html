<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle had watched in stunned silence as Ginger had transformed before her very eyes. Her mind had simply kind of...just...removed itself from the situation. And so, she&#39;d watched, feeling distant and a bit numb, as Ginger&#39;s legs and arms had begun to vanish, as her skin had become fabric, as Lucy and Heather had begun playing with her body and tossing it around...treating it like a pillow...<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t even realized she&#39;d been backing up until her back hit a mirror. Nor had she realized she was beginning to show signs of anxiety, until she felt how her hands and legs were trembling while pressed up against the mirror.<br />
<br />
Lucy and Heather had seemingly forgotten about her during the transformation. <br />
<br />
And it wasn&#39;t until they&#39;d suddenly turned as one to look at her that Michelle finally began to come a bit back to herself. And she let out a frightened squeak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t...that&#39;s...&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
Heather leaped up and rushed over to Michelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey,&quot; she soothed. &quot;It&#39;s okay. Calm down....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down??&quot; Michelle demanded, turning to look at Heather incredulously. &quot;I just watched a girl turn into a fucking pillow - and the same thing is gonna happen to me! You want me to...to calm down?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather put a hand on Michelle&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m here, it&#39;s okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle let out a shaky, disbelieving laugh. Had they lost their minds?? She didn&#39;t want to be a pillow! She moaned and reached up to her bra, trying to tug it off - but there was no use. The frilly material was stuck, just like it had been on Ginger. <br />
<br />
Heather put both of her hands on Michelle&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t fully know what&#39;s going on. But Ginger seemed to enjoy the change once she got past the initial stages...so...once it&#39;s over, we can try and figure out how to undo it?&quot; The other girl shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s just not much we can seem to do about it right now...but...we&#39;ll figure it out. I promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle opened her mouth to thank the other girl, but then a sudden sensation shot through her, making her gasp and stumble away. It was like an electric shock had struck every nerve. She let out a gasping breath, and then found herself falling backwards with a small scream. <br />
<br />
She looked down at her feet, fully expecting to see that they&#39;d begun to disappear.<br />
<br />
Except, they hadn&#39;t. Her feet, instead ...<br />
<br />
They&#39;d turned into wood.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; she gasped. Heather looked down, her own eyes wide as well. <br />
<br />
Michelle went to go and try to push herself up - but - when her hands struck the floor - she realized she couldn&#39;t move her fingers at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no!&quot; Michelle moaned, holding up her hands. &quot;What the fuck is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
She let out another gasp as her body jolted with another sensation, and she found her arms and legs moving against her own volition. They lifted her body up awkwardly in a sort of crab-walk position. She let out a startled scream, and could feel the cold sensation of the wood spreading a bit, up her arms and legs - and in the meantime, her back was beginning to feel cold and stiff as well, and it was spreading. <br />
<br />
But...the upper part of her body...it was also feeling weird. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s - what&#39;s going on?!&quot; Michelle cried. &quot;What&#39;s - ooooh!&quot; <br />
<br />
A blissful sensation washed across her upper body, sending pulsing sensations straight to her pussy. <br />
<br />
A moment later, her eyes opened in shock once more, and she saw - and felt - as her thighs and upper legs began to press together. Eyes wide, she watched as what seemed to be threads began to flow from one leg to the other - binding them together - and watched in disbelief as they became a single block. The panties had been absorbed into her skin - and her entire lower body looked like some kind of silky fabric - though she could still make out her pussy, still trembling from the sensations of the change - sticking through where her crotch had once been.<br />
<br />
She twisted and pulled, but could only make her body twitch a bit. Her back felt cold and stiff and she couldn&#39;t twitch her hands or feet at all. <br />
<br />
Then a new sensation joined in, and she let out a shaky moan - it felt like - it felt like her whole body was being stretched, or pulled. Wider and wider. She could feel the fabric covering her stomach - and felt how her stomach went a bit numb as it became silky like her lower body. Her head was pushed forward a bit, and she gasped, forced to look down at her rapidly changing body - something stiff and hard had grown behind her. Her shoulders and upper arms had begun to twist and change themselves into some kind of wooden barrier...<br />
<br />
&quot;S-stop!&quot; she gasped. &quot;What&#39;s...oooh...what&#39;s happening...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather and Lucy were watching in stunned silence. Heather was clutching the pillowfied body of Ginger close, squeezing it a bit. <br />
<br />
Her body was wider and taller that it had been before the change had started. She couldn&#39;t move anything now, save for her head and eyes, which were still stuck in their position. The frilly bra had begun to spread across the rest of her upper body, flattening it out and transforming it into the same silky material that her lower body had become.<br />
<br />
It had been fairly obvious what she&#39;d been turning into - her mind just couldn&#39;t face the reality once it had become apparent.<br />
<br />
But Heather and Lucy had no such problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Lucy whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you&#39;ve turned into a bed,&quot; Heather said.<br />
<br />
Michelle let out a moan. The sensation of change was beginning to fade, leaving her feeling a bit numb and light. The backside of her body and her limbs felt cold and stiff and hard - fully transformed into wood. Though she couldn&#39;t look and see, she could feel that her ass was still kind of sticking out of the bottom of the bed, though it too had transformed into solid wood. Meanwhile, the front half of her body had turned into the mattress of the bed, with her skin become silky and smooth like sheets - except it was all a part of her. She could feel every bit of it.<br />
<br />
Heather looked down at Ginger, and then back at Michelle. &quot;A bed for a pillow,&quot; she said. Then she giggled.<br />
<br />
Lucy giggled as well.<br />
<br />
And then even Michelle let out a slight laugh, because what else was there to do in such a surreal situation? She was stuck but good.<br />
<br />
Until Heather stepped forward. Still holding onto Ginger, she slowly lowered herself onto Michelle&#39;s newly transformed body, sinking into the fabric.<br />
<br />
Michelle let out a startled gasp, which quickly transformed into a sensual moan as the sensations of being sat upon spread through her. It was like every nerve was being teased - she could feel the mattress portion of her skin compressing under Heather&#39;s weight. <br />
<br />
Heather carefully put Ginger down so that she was lying down just next to where Michelle&#39;s head was. Smiling, Heather moved over so that she was fully resting on the bed now.<br />
<br />
Michelle was beyond speech now; it felt like her entire body was vibrating from the sheer pleasure of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm...&quot; Heather said. &quot;You&#39;re so soft...and comfy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy joined Heather on the bed, smiling.<br />
<br />
Michelle gasped as the intensity increased - and actually felt her eyes begin to roll up as she felt Lucy&#39;s soft fingers start to massage the fabric opening that led to her still pulsing pussy. <br />
<br />
Lucy giggled. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a bed wetting be so literal,&quot; she teased, increasingly the rubbing speed against the silky fabric. The fabric around the opening seemed to be twitching and pulsing from her touch. <br />
<br />
Heather laughed as well, pressed herself up against Ginger&#39;s pillowfied form, sticking her tongue gingerly into the plush pussy that was still available. <br />
<br />
And Michelle&#39;s mind went reeling into dimensions of pleasure she hadn&#39;t known were possible. All earlier fright had been shoved from her mind, and her only concern now was making sure the pleasure continued, because it felt that good. She could feel every movement the two girls atop her made - felt how nice it was to have Ginger on her, completing their collection. And Heather and Lucy were clearly enjoying themselves as well, enjoying their transformed friends as well as rubbing up against one another.</p>
