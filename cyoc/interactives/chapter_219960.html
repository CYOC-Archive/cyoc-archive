<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul wasn&#39;t fully prepared as Cathy jumped onto him, but he got into the swing of things pretty quickly. Passionately kissing her, he held her up by her butt while she ran her hands all over him. And even though she already had great curves, now that he knew he could change her, he couldn&#39;t resist making some improvements.<br />
<br />
Since she had jumped on him and he was holding her butt, he started there, making it just a bit bigger and far more firm and toned. And so he could let go of her butt, he made her more muscular in other areas too. Her legs got much stronger, while he also kept them thin and smooth and gave her an impossibly wide thigh gap. Her arms bulged with muscle, and then smoothed over. You could still see and feel the muscle definition underneath, but they were now incredibly smooth and sexy too. Now that she could easily support her own weight, he moved his hands along her side and up her back. Keeping her hips wide, he brought her waist in, gave her plenty of lower back strength, and brought smooth definition to her back.<br />
<br />
He briefly broke off his kiss with her lips to move his mouth to her neck. While he sensually kissed it, moving ever closer back to her lips, he elongated her neck slightly, thinning it out a bit in the process and making it super smooth and sensitive. Then he turned his attention to her face. Her silky hair lightened into a beautiful light strawberry blonde. Her nose mostly faded into her face while curving out at the bottom to form the cutest button nose. And her lips… he puffed them up a bit, and then turned their sensitivity way up, making them as sensitive as her nipples had been before. He backed off his kiss intensity a bit so as to not overwhelm her just yet.<br />
<br />
He noticed his lips get more sensitive as well, so he spent some time just enjoying passionately making out with his stunningly beautiful girlfriend, running his hands over her breasts and down to her stomach. Realizing he&#39;d made her strong everywhere else, he made sure to give her some great core strength as well, smoothing the skin over so she didn&#39;t look or feel like she was as strong as she had actually become.<br />
<br />
As he felt her sticking his dick into her, he decided it was time for a change of position and laid her down onto the bed. Despite all the muscle mass she had gained, she seemed unusually light, and getting his dick into her also seemed unusually difficult. He increased her wetness to help, and started to thrust, moving his hands up to her breasts and gently massaging them. Cathy began to moan, and Paul noticed he was a lot more sensitive than before. He let out a moan as well, and struggled to concentrate on the changes he still wanted to make to Cathy. It was just feeling so good!<br />
<br />
Thrusting into her, and trying not to lose his mind to the pleasure, Paul managed to get his hands on her muscular yet smooth stomach and work their way up to her breasts. Not that Cathy had anything to be ashamed of, but Paul wanted them bigger. Struggling to focus, he wished them bigger, and especially more perky. And they grew. Slowly increasing in volume in his hands, and perking up, her increased sexiness made it even harder for Paul to concentrate. He managed to get one final change in to her breasts. They got more sensitive.<br />
<br />
Cathy was feeling great with a giant dick ravaging her wet pussy, and Paul massaging her breasts was nice too. She could feel some pressure starting to build from his emphatic thrusting, but suddenly she noticed a new source of pleasure. His hands on her breasts started to feel really good. And as he moved his fingers to her nipples, her body spasmed as a wave of pleasure washed over her. It was almost as if he had touched her clit, except he was touching her nipples. It was feeling so good, maybe too good. She had to do something to slow it down. So she decided to flip him over again. It was strangely easier than normal. She got on top of him and started riding him, feeling his massive dick inside her, filling her up, stimulating all the right places inside her with its impressive girth and massive length.<br />
<br />
The position change gave Paul a chance to breathe. He came to his senses as his girlfriend flipped him with ease and straddled him. He felt the pressure start to build again as she started bouncing up and down, her big perky tits starting to hypnotize him. But he pulled his gaze away and started to feel her body, focusing his eyes anywhere but her tits. He felt her smooth long thin legs, feeling up to her ample, solid butt, and around to her toned yet smooth stomach. He thought of one final change to make, and started thinking it as his hands moved up her torso toward her breasts. He finished his thought just as his hands made it to her breasts, massaged them briefly, and then started twerking her nipples. At this point, all thought left his brain and all that remained was ecstasy. His unbelievably sexy girlfriend was bouncing up and down on his massive, highly sensitive dick while he massaged and twerked her breasts and nipples.<br />
<br />
Cathy felt Paul&#39;s hands reaching back up toward her breasts, and anticipation was building. The sparks coming from her vagina were starting to push her toward the edge, and she knew once his hands made it back to her unusually sensitive breasts that she&#39;d be a goner. But just before his hands made it to her breasts, she felt an intense sensation coming from somewhere else: her vagina. It seemed like the entire thing had been turned into a million g-spots and the jolts of pleasure that started to emanate from it were nearly unbearable. And then his hands connected with her breasts. A few brief massages, and twerks of her nipples, and she couldn&#39;t contain herself any longer. The pleasure was coming from everywhere, and the orgasm that wracked her body was the most intense she&#39;d ever experienced. Wave after wave of pleasure coursed through her body, and each time her vagina squeezed his dick with surprising strength. It seemed as though each wave counted as its own orgasm for him, and his refractory period seemed to have been reduced to near-zero as his body spasmed with orgasm for every wave of pleasure that rocked her body. He only ejaculated once, but each subsequent wave of pleasure was no lesser for lack of accompanying bodily fluid.<br />
<br />
As her orgasm started to die down, Cathy managed to lean over toward Paul&#39;s face and give him a deep, passionate kiss, which briefly re-ignited the flame inside both of them, sending one last powerful orgasm sweeping through both of their bodies.<br />
<br />
With that, Cathy finally slid off of him and flopped onto her side of the bed, and his member finally started to soften, though only to 7&quot; flaccid. Their minds were both nearly completely blank in ecstasy, and they were also both exhausted. With one last burst of strength, Cathy got into a spooning position. Paul&#39;s member perked up just a bit as her incredibly pert breasts pressed into his back. Her arm wrapped over him, found and grabbed his slightly hard member, and they both drifted off to sleep…</p>
