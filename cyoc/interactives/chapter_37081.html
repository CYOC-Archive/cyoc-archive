<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dianne:<br />
<br />
It has been six years since Mommy punished me be regressing me to her womb. She had repeatedly threatened me and Tiffany that she would turn our awareness off if we weren't good. I knew that she couldn't do that to me since I was able to see what was on the laptop six years ago. I was pretty sure that Tiffany's awareness could be turned off though so we were good.<br />
<br />
Once when we were four Daddy had hit Mommy because he had a bad day at work. She decided that he needed to grow-up right so she regressed him to two years old. She felt that we needed a Daddy though so she had changed Allison into a man and regressed him a bit. Of course this made Maxine and Amy our big sisters.<br />
<br />
Now me and Tiffany were in our room that we share with Kathy talking about how we can use the program again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to download the program onto another computer&quot; Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could twy&quot; I said. I still had trouble with my Rs. &quot;Mommy has the computer locked too though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we go to a friend's house and use their's&quot; Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you weally want that pwogwam on someone's computer?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Tiffany sighed and said &quot;I guess not. We have to try and find a way to get access to the program though. I want to get things back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you do&quot; I said. &quot;I'm happy like this though. I weally don't want to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're just weird&quot; Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Mommy came into our room and said &quot;So here you are. What were you two girls talking about? It wouldn't happen to be how to get to the program would it?&quot;<br />
<br />
We didn't say anything. Mommy had probably heard us talking. How much she heard would be revealed soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not saying anything?&quot; Mommy asked. &quot;That's ok. I know that you were. You both know that I have the computer and laptop password protected and you won't risk anyone else having the program. Now why don't you stop talking about it? Otherwise I might have to clear your aware settings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead Mommy&quot; I said. &quot;Twy to clear my aware settings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I almost forgot about that&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Well I guess I'll have to figure out something else for you. I could clear Tiffany's aware settings if you're not good. Would you like that Dianne?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that wouldn't be fair&quot; Mommy said. &quot;I do have another option though. There has been an update to the program. I've already installed it. It can now change people into inanimate objects. So you be good Dianne or I'll turn you into something that won't be able to talk or move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; I said. &quot;I'll be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that's better&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Now are you girls ready to for school to start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have to go to school?&quot; Tiffany asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you do&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Remember that everyone else remembers you two as my six year old daughters. What kind of parent would I be if I didn't send my daughters to school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could home school us&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And have you miss out on the social aspects of school?&quot; Mommy asked. &quot;I don't think that that's a good idea. You two are going to school and I won't hear anything about not going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been thwough school though&quot; I said. &quot;I gwaduated years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a six year old girl Dianne&quot; Mommy said. &quot;You haven't even been to school yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're smarter than other six year olds&quot; Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can fix that&quot; Mommy said. &quot;At least for you Tiffany. I can't fix it for Dianne. Dianne, you'll just have to act like you're a six year old girl in mind as well as body. Same for you Tiffany.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we have to act dumb&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not dumb&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Just act like you know nothing more than your average six year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; I said. This would be interesting. I was bored in school the first time around and I couldn't help but wonder how bored I would be this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go swimming?&quot; Tiffany asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I haven't been able to replace Dianne's swimsuit yet&quot; Mommy said.<br />
<br />
My swimsuit had been stolen a couple of days ago and Mommy hasn't bought me a new one yet. Just then the doorbell rang and Mommy went to answer it. Me and Tiffany followed.<br />
<br />
Mommy's friend Denise was at the door. Her son Dennis was with her. &quot;I'm sorry about what David has done&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mommy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dennis stole Dianne's swimsuit the last time we were over here&quot; Denise said. &quot;Unfortunately he and his friends ruined it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Denise took out my swimsuit from a bag that she was carrying. My swimsuit was indeed ruined. There were large tears in the fabric, especially in the crotch and chest areas. If I wore it my nipples and genitals would be exposed for the world to see. Not that I would want to wear it since there were suspicious yellow stains on it. Dennis and his friends were around eleven years old and I knew that they probably jerked off over my swimsuit. I started to wonder<br />
if they were thinking of me when they did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what are you waiting for?&quot; Denise asked looking at Dennis. &quot;Apologize to them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've already lost your allowance for the next four weeks to pay for a new swimsuit for Dianne!&quot; Denise said. &quot;Do you want to lose it for even longer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sorry for what I did&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you take Dianne's swimsuit Dennis?&quot; Mommy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... want to... be... with... her&quot; Dennis stammered as he blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that confirms what I thought those stains were&quot; Mommy said.<br />
<br />
Dennis blushed even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can assure you that he is being severely punished&quot; Denise said. &quot;He's grounded to the house unless I'm with him. He doesn't get to play any of his video games. His allowance is going for a new swimsuit for Dianne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad will let me play my video games&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's always undermining me!&quot; Denise said. &quot;You want to know what he said when I told him? He said that I was being too hard on Dennis. That boys will be boys and I shouldn't punish him. If the courts hadn't of mandated that Dennis gets to see his father every weekend I wouldn't let him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather live with Dad&quot; Dennis said. &quot;I like him better than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He would let you get away with murder!&quot; Denise said. &quot;He doesn't hold you accountable for anything that you do. He didn't even want to have anything to do with me when I became pregnant with you. He thought that I was seeing someone else behind his back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because you were&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how would you know that?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad told me&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just about at my wits end with you!&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea&quot; Mommy said. &quot;Go ahead and sit down in the living room while I go get my laptop. Dianne, Tiffany, I want you two to go sit in the living room too.&quot;<br />
<br />
We agreed but I knew why Mommy had told us to sit in the living room. She was going to use the program. I just wondered what she was going to do.</p>
