<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff slowly opened his eyes.  He felt a little groggy, so it took a bit for him to realize that he was no longer in his room staring at his computer.  In fact, he was down on the ground, staring at what appeared to be straw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uurgh...&quot;  Jeff groaned as he tried to get up.  Or at least, he tried to groan.  It actually came out as more of a squeak.  Jeff froze, trying to make sense of what had happened.  His ears twitched at the sound of people approaching.  Wait, twitched?  Suddenly, he felt himself lifted up by the scruff of the neck.  He hadn&#39;t realized he was so small.  The people surrounding him looked like giants, even though he got the impression they were of high school age like him.  Although he wanted to twist around and see who had grabbed him, and maybe get a look at himself and what he had become, he found that all he could do while held by the scruff was hang limply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take him, he&#39;ll do,&quot;  an assertive female voice came from behind him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure, Val?&quot;  one of the boys in the group.  &quot;What&#39;re you gonna do with something scrawny like him?  Wouldn&#39;t you do better with a griffin or dragon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmph,&quot;  Val snorted.  &quot;What am I gonna do with a dragon?  I could beat one with one hand tied behind my back.  They&#39;re all teeth and scales anyway.  For me, this one will be more useful.&quot;  Jeff saw most of the group glance at each other and nod in apparent agreement, so he froze up again.  What sort of creature was holding him, that could beat up a dragon?  What did he get himself into?<br />
<br />
An older woman who seemed to be in charge nodded, and Jeff was carried out of what looked like a large stable or animal holding area by Val, still held by the scruff.  Although he couldn&#39;t really look around, he did manage to see that they appeared to be walking through the wooded grounds of a large school, with stone buildings and ivy-covered walls.  However, some of the people walking around seemed odd.  Due to Val&#39;s bouncing gait, he couldn&#39;t get a clear look, but something was off about them...<br />
<br />
Finally, they arrived at Val&#39;s dorm room, a relatively large single with stone walls, a large four-poster bed, and a balcony.  Val placed Jeff on the ground, and when he finally looked up at her, his eyes grew large.  Val removed the sword around her belt and hung it on a hook, then turned towards Jeff.  She was dressed in form-fitting armor, and looked for all intents and purposes like a knight, or a modern-day Joan of Arc.  However, this was juxtaposed with the laptop that was sitting on a nearby desk and the cell phone charging in the corner.  Finally, Jeff spotted a full-length mirror across the room, and shocked, stared at his own reflection in it.  He was a...rabbit?!<br />
<br />
How could this be?  He was sure he had selected &quot;reindeer&quot;?  He wanted to be something beautiful and strong, not a weak little furball!  Jeff trembled involuntarily.  And even more than that, he had ended up not with a ravishing damsel but this girl in a tin can!  Jeff shuddered in fear and frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s see how you turn out,&quot;  Val muttered as she approached the cowering rabbit with clanking steps.  Stopping a few feet away, Val pointed at Jeff and murmured a few words in a language he could not understand.  Suddenly, there was a flash.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there blinking, trying to get his eyes to adjust.  When they did, the first thing he noticed was that he was now at eye level with Val, even a bit taller than her.  In fact, he seemed to be back to his usual height.  He was human again!  His ears twitched with joy.<br />
<br />
Wait, twitched?  Involuntarily, Jeff reached up.  Instead of normal human ears on the side of his head, sprouting from closer to the top of his head were two, very long, very soft rabbit ears.  Before he could do or say anything, Val approached, placing a hand under his chin and looking him over from head to toe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, nothing special, but I guess it&#39;ll do for now,&quot;  Val snorted, at which point Jeff realized that he was completely naked.  Quickly, he dropped his hands to cover his groin, but Val had already turned away and begun removing her armor, which she placed on a wooden form.  Looking again at the mirror, Jeff was horrified by what he saw.  Although he was humanoid, and quite similar to his old body, he clearly had two snow-white rabbit ears sprouting from the top of his head, which now sported white fur-like hair.  Not only that, but his feet looked like anthropomorphic rabbit&#39;s feet, dusted with a light layer of fur, as were his hands, which had slight paw-like pads.  Even his nose seemed a bit triangular and pink, although he did not have buckteeth, even though his front teeth were slightly larger.  However, what startled him the most was that when he turned slightly, he saw sprouting from the end of his spine what looked like a large white cotton-ball  - a rabbit&#39;s tail - and when he dropped his hands, a patch of white fur covering a sheath, which now held his gentalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who...what did you do to me?&quot;  Jeff gasped at Val, who continued to remove her armor and did not bother turning around.<br />
<br />
&quot;As my familiar, you&#39;re going to have to be in humanoid form most of the time, except for the 6 hours or so between school ending and bedtime while I recharge my magical energy,&quot;  Val began, not even looking at Jeff.  &quot;Don&#39;t get into trouble and don&#39;t be a nuisance and we&#39;ll get along fine.  Otherwise -&quot;  Val finally turned around with a feral grin &quot; - I don&#39;t mind eating rabbit stew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gaped, as much at Val&#39;s words as at her figure.  Having finished removing her armor and clothes, Jeff had to admit that Val was quite attractive.  Standing there completely naked with her hands on her hips, Val sported a wiry, tanned athletic form marred here and there by scars from more than a few fights.  Her wavy auburn hair, now loose, draped over her shoulders, and she was definitely well-proportioned where it counted.  Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel a slight stirring in his sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot;  Val said without missing a beat,&quot;  Make yourself useful and go draw me a bath.&quot;</p>
