<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And you prefer the Spanish Fighting Bull?&quot; Doctor Stein asked to the man that stood before him.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein noted that the man was a bit older, but looked relatively comfortable for the moment. And for the moment, the bills in the Senate hadn&#39;t passed yet. There was an increasing sign that it WOULD pass, but that hadn&#39;t happened yet. In this, Doctor Stein figured to continue on while it was legally allowed to do so. And at the same time, the man gave no visual indication that Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome was likely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; the man nodded, &quot;Is that a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;dealing with domestic animal breeds has been fairly easy, as Horizon has been able to get blood and DNA samples for the construction of the specific strands of the Animalia Virus. It&#39;s more with extinct species and wild animal species where the acquisition of DNA samples where there has been more hoops and difficulty to go through.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man slowly shrugged and nodded, &quot;Well... that&#39;s good. I&#39;ve always liked the Spanish Fighting Bull. It&#39;s looked strong and athletic. Sorta like you&#39;d expect from a superhero...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course that athletic look was more in relation to bullfighting,&quot; Doctor Stein commented, &quot;which in Spain is lethal to the bull.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t mean that the bull itself doesn&#39;t look good,&quot; the man answered, to which Doctor Stein nodded. Many people that willingly converted to be Animalians often did so because they admired and respected the strength and power and look of the animal in question. That was often a pretty standard reason for why many &quot;furries&quot; converted into Animalians.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein eventually collected a pair of syringes that were marked &quot;Spanish Fighting Bull&quot; from one of the refrigerators from the main lab and lead the man to one of the changing rooms. He carefully explained the process of how the injections would go and how the transformation would progress. The man listened quietly as he sat on the bed and then slowly began to disrobe as Doctor Stein finished his explanation, eventually leaving the man in his underwear. The man gave Doctor Stein a somewhat nervous smile as Doctor Stein began to apply the alcohol wipe to get ready for the injections, but the doctor ignored it for the moment. He figured the man was a bit nervous over some things, which was expectable as there were plenty of things of that were of that nature that were pretty typical when it came to human conversions.<br />
<br />
&quot;And welcome to Animalia,&quot; Doctor Stein gave the man an assuring smile as he administered the shots. It was something that had become rather routine which Horizon felt would be comforting and welcoming for those that volunteered and gave assurance to those that volunteered for things like Project Phoenix that while their physical and hormonal changes could be great, it wouldn&#39;t be something that would make them lose what was often considered the core element of their humanity in their ability to reason and think and so on.<br />
<br />
The man nodded as Doctor Stein left and then looked down to his hands and arms. He could feel his body growing warmer which was often the signal of the start of the transformation. As he looked down, he could see black hairs growing out and thickening into fur. It itched a little, but it did make him smile slightly, especially as other changes began to rapidly kick in. His fingernails began to grow thicker and harder, while his fingers also grew thicker and stronger. He watched as his hands shifted from normal human fingers to the well muscled fingers that was typical of all the bovine Animalians, complete with hooves at the tip of each finger. It might mean some loss of dexterity, but the strength that went with it was pretty clear.<br />
<br />
And those changes continued everywhere else. His feet cracked and crackled a bit as his foot bones began to lengthen and as his second toe began to rapidly enlarge. Once it was as big as his big toe, both toes continued to grow larger and stronger, with hooves at their tips. It wasn&#39;t long before he shakily stood up on two digitigrade legs with two toed feet. As he stood up, many old aches and pains in his joints seemed to be going away and at the same time, he could feel all his muscle groups seeming to twitch and swell. The man made his way before the mirror and could soon see the changes ever more clearly. His face had lost his wrinkles and he&#39;d gotten most of his hair back, though its light brown contrasted with his black fur, but his muscle mass is what caught his eye the most.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never been THIS strong before,&quot; he thought as he flexed his pectoral muscles in the mirror, marveling at how his now furry chest moved with him in a way that felt rather natural, &quot;Heh... Now I&#39;ve got the brawn to stand up to all those bullies in high school that found it fun to make me feel unwelcome...&quot;<br />
<br />
The word &quot;brawn&quot; seemed to echo in his mind as he felt his ears flare out toward the upper sides of his head. Above them, a pair of grey horns began to grow out and ultimately curved forward while coming to very sharp points. It didn&#39;t hurt, though as the rest of his body continued to grow larger and more muscular, his underwear was also beginning to grow tight on him. It was something that stayed there, even as he tried to wrestle with the waistband on his underwear, particularly as his equipment was also feeling extremely constrained inside them. And then there was a soft but still audible crack as his lower back and spine began to grew new vertebrae, and with that his underwear soon tore apart at the seems. It revealed a much larger set of testicles, held in a black fur beneath his sheath, from which was also emerging a large erection. Behind him a black furred and tasseled tail swayed behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Brawn would work,&quot; the man thought with a smile, &quot;with the strength and energy to be with a good man to match this level of power... it&#39;s good... and it&#39;d be a good name... Brawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
He flexed again, this time in a full pose with his arms raised above his shoulders. He marveled at his now wide shoulders and bulging muscle that was far greater than anything he&#39;d ever had before. He looked a bit smaller than most of Animalia&#39;s other bulls, but then they were also Belgian Blue Cattle, which were a far bulkier breed. And as his face pushed forward into a bovine muzzle, he knew that as a Spanish Fighting Bull, his muscle was more for athleticism and &quot;aggression,&quot; even if he didn&#39;t plan on participating in any bullfights.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look good,&quot; Brawn smiled to himself, &quot;though I suppose I&#39;ll need something to contain all this glorious man... bull meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gave a low snort and let some of the passion that had built up in the transformation subside before he headed toward the door. He opened it and looked out to find Doctor Stein patiently waiting for him outside it with some clothing that Brawn thought would fit him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were...&quot; Brawn began as he accepted the clothes, and grateful that the shirt was a button down one, as he wasn&#39;t sure if even an enlarged tee-shirt would work with his horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;We generally try to make sure that all new Animalians have clothing after their conversion,&quot; Doctor Stein answered as Brawn put the clothes on, &quot;You may need to restock your overall wardrobe... but at least this way you won&#39;t be doing so naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Brawn answered, though he did fumble a bit with the buttons, but he did manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Mister...&quot; Doctor Stein began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brawn,&quot; Brawn answered, &quot;It&#39;s better than my old name and might be something to attract...&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice fell off a Cow Animalian came around a corner from the hallway. She was a white furred Belgian Blue Cow wearing a somewhat loose top, though given her own muscle and the large orbs on her chest, the shirt was probably a bit tighter than what would have been expected. She was also wearing a pair of blue jeans as she walked along. The most telling thing was that she had no hair on her head beyond her fur, which marked her as among the cattle that the Brown family owned before the initial outbreak. She saw Doctor Stein and approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Doctor Stein... I&#39;m here for my vaccination renewal,&quot; the Belgian Blue female spoke with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms. Snowflake,&quot; Doctor Stein answered with a small smile, &quot;I&#39;ll be right with you... I&#39;ve...&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to see that Brawn had backed up a little and was trying to look away for the moment. He couldn&#39;t as Ms. Snowflake turned her head and saw the new Bull Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; Ms. Snowflake said to Brawn as she came forward, &quot;I&#39;m Petunia Snowflake, what&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brawn found himself looking straight to her. She was powerfully built, perhaps not as athletic as him, but she was likely very strong. He carefully shook her hand and responded and found himself occasionally looking down to her chest as they shook hands. It then embarrassed him a bit, as he&#39;d never really had that... urge before. He&#39;d been homosexual and actually fairly comfortable in it, even with how he&#39;d been treated in the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve actually been thinking of changing my name now...&quot; Brawn answered, &quot;something to fight the new me. So far... I have Brawn as a first name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it fits,&quot; Petunia said with a smile, &quot;I know a few cows that would love the attention from a big brawny bull like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brawn almost gave a nervous jump back, which half surprised Petunia and Doctor Stein. Some of it was at the fact that Petunia had suggested meeting some of the other Cow Animalians and that they&#39;d like him and the rest was at the fact that a part of him was surprisingly open to the idea. He&#39;d never had that sort of thing before, and he didn&#39;t want to lose who and what he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I say something wrong, sir?&quot; Petunia asked, with her ears hanging low for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Brawn managed, &quot;it&#39;s just that... well... I... uh... I&#39;ve never had...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you that no Cow Animalian would be mean to you for being new,&quot; Petunia spoke, &quot;they&#39;d be quite happy to have a friend and potential bond-mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not being mean that I&#39;m worried about,&quot; Brawn answered, &quot;I&#39;ve actually had some friends that are female... it&#39;s just that my interest... it was never sexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was something that Doctor Stein caught onto. As he began to realize this, he caught on to some of the smaller things that he&#39;d seen but shrugged off as simple nervousness. He also remembered a discussion with Judy in that she&#39;d helped with another man that was gay who became a King Cobra Animalian. It was something that was also being noticed to varying degrees that while humans that had been heterosexual wouldn&#39;t have any affect on their sexuality by becoming an Animalian, unless one counted the increase in their sex drive, it was something that was being noted with those humans that were homosexual. The animal instinct to breed and either sire young or bear young was there and resulted in homosexual Animalians becoming bisexual, and this could be something that converted Animalians that were homosexual could be uncomfortable with as feelings of attraction toward the opposite gender appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of this may be conflicting,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;but first, Animalia will not reject you for your sexuality. You don&#39;t have to worry about that. Second, we have a psychologist here by the name of Doctor Jones. He might be able to help you acclimate to the certain breeding instincts if they trouble you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Brawn said slowly even as Petunia came forward for a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;And regardless of who you like,&quot; Petunia said to him, &quot;always know that you&#39;ll have welcome friends...&quot;</p>
