<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe and Amanda turn around to watch poor Butches reactions as his old team mates close in on the now frail tiny Butch, his name now doesent match his body at
<br>
 all. Amanda started to feel sorry for Butch as he stood there unable to run in his way over sized boots and jeans. &quot;We can't leive him like that Joe! His clothes are
<br>
 to big for him! He can't even run away from them Joe.&quot; Amanda said almost pleading with Joe to turn Butch back to his old size. Joe would have none of that
<br>
 though, he was enjoying the show. 
<br>

<br>
 The guys from his football team soon caught up with Butch as he stood there having to hold his over sized jeans up. Butch was crying openly now as they
<br>
 approched him and staired down at him, Butch tryed to keep his head down so they wouldnt see his face but it was to late. Bill Mcguire Reconized who this tiny
<br>
 guy wearing over sized jeans was right away. Joe stood watching as Amanda kept pleading with him to change Butch back, &quot;HEs learned his lesson Joe change
<br>
 him back please!&quot; Amanda pleaded. Joe looked over at her and said &quot;I wish you were at your house in your bedroom Amanda!&quot; Amanda disapeared from where
<br>
 they were standing and Joe smiled! &quot;I WISH I DID'NT HAVE TO SAY I WISH TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN!&quot; Joe screamed, then he looked over at the
<br>
 three big football players to see who each of them was! He was going to have fun with these big guys now! But first he would have to test to see if his wish had
<br>
 come true. 
<br>

<br>
 The guys heard him yell his wish and were stairing back and forth from their shrunken friend to where Joe was standing. They had to have heard him make his wish,
<br>
 and that meant they knew who had done this to their friend! 
<br>

<br>
 These guys could mop the floor with Joe if they caught up with him, or he did'nt do something to even up the odds a bit. 
<br>

<br>
 Joe wished they all would just freeze where they were standing. he did it with out wishing it though. He simply thought freeze! And all four of the guys did! This was
<br>
 going to be fun! Joe knew all of the guys personally and hated each for one reason or another, and now he was going to make these big assholes pay for their
<br>
 treatment of him and any other little guy at their school! All three knew they were big guys and pushed all of his friends around when ever they wanted to. They
<br>
 werent just big guys either they were good looking big guys, they always had all the good looking girls vieing for their attention! Joe was so jelouse of that fact, he
<br>
 was this tall lanky some what geeky looking guy and these guys were just blessed with all the good looks and great bodys, it just wasent fair Joe thought. 
<br>

<br>
 Ther was Stan Berger the running back of the team, he was so musculare and big, that alone would have been enough to turn heads, but he also like the others of
<br>
 their elite group had the looks of a model! Perfect white teeth a thick mustash below a small unatrusive nose, square strong jaw line with a dimpled in the middle of
<br>
 his perfect chin. At 185Lbs on a 6 foot body that was taughnt and well muscled he stood out in a crowd! His legs filled his jeans to the max, and left nothing to the
<br>
 imagination. Including his large endowment in his jeans.For Stan it would be bean pole time! Only he'd become a very skinny bean pole not all at once like Butch
<br>
 had changed these three would change over time. 
<br>

<br>
 Then there was Greg Little, there was nothing little about Greg though he was both tall and muscular at 6'4&quot; and 235Lbs he towered over most of the guys at the
<br>
 school including the teachers! He was also good looking in a brutish way! He turned eyes for more then just his size. Joe had always hated Greg, Greg called him a
<br>
 bean pole all the time. Joe hated that, and he also hated haveing to look up to look the bastard in the eyes! How would Greg like it if he was the one who had to
<br>
 look up to see people in the eyes, and how would he like it if he was thinner then any guy or girl around, then he would be the one who got picked on and not the
<br>
 other way around! 
<br>

<br>
 Then there was Bill Maguire the best looking guy at the school, he wasent as tall as the other guys were though at 5'9&quot; inches but he weighed in at 170Lbs of pure
<br>
 toned mucsle, it gave him a look of both streanth and confidence. His legs were so big and strong looking his shorter stature had made his legs look positivly body
<br>
 builder like, his bare torso showed off his massive pecs and six pack abbs and his very broad shoulders tapered down to a firm thick 32 inch waist, from behind he
<br>
 had the perfect 'V' shaped back, and a cute jock bubble butt set his body off like a greek gods. But his face was what Joe enveyed the most, Long bangs hung
<br>
 down form each side of his forhead and framed his deep blue preircing eyes his hair was almost black and his eye brows were thick and perfect looking, he always
<br>
 looked like he needed to shave, his cheeks sported deep dimples when he smiled and his strong sqaur jaw line gave him that look that stood him out in a crowd, he
<br>
 also had a very hairy body as well his quarter sized nips were surrounded by dark hair that radiated out ward to frame his wide thick pecs and then streamed down
<br>
 the middle of his tight abbs and disapeared in his tight lt blue Levis. He was also the smartest of the group, probably one of the smartest guys at the school for that
<br>
 matter. But he had made one mistake in his life! He had kicked Joes ass for something he did'nt even do! And now he would pay with his looks body and brains
<br>
 for it. 
<br>

<br>
 Joe had made up his mide for the changes in the guys, and then set the changes into action, Joe had added a few other humiliating changes for the guys to endure
<br>
 and then wished all but Butch and Bill to their prespective houses to await the changes that would befall them over the next few weeks! Joe then made Butch think
<br>
 he was still a big guy, and changed his clothes to fit his tiny frame, he laughed as he thought of how Butch would react as others saw him as he was and he saw
<br>
 himself as still being this big guy! Then he wished Butch to his bedroom and to sleep so no one would see him till tomarrow. 
<br>

<br>
 Now it was time to have some fun with Bill! Bill was still froze as Joe approached him. We're going to have some fun now Bill Joe said as they both dissapeared
<br>
 and then reapeared in Bill science class, Bill found himself standing in front of the class giving an oral report to the class, he thought it was like dejavue! He just
<br>
 done this earlyer that day. Bill shook his head to clear it and then looked out over the class, they were all smiling at him and some were even giggleing, Bill thought
<br>
 that was weird! No one ever laughed at him! He was this brite smart athleticly well built guy! Every body respected him and wished they could be like he was, or
<br>
 at leist he thought they did? 
<br>

<br>
 Bill thought maybe he was just day dreaming and he really hadent given his report yet, so he looked down at his paper and was about to give his report when he
<br>
 noticed he had on thick glasses? What the fuck he thought as he reached up unconciously and felt them, he looked out at the class and eveyone was still smiling, he
<br>
 took off the glasses and every thing went blury, whats going on here he thought as he put the glasses back on and every thing cleared up! God whats happened to
<br>
 my eyes I don't wear glasses he thought as he looked back down at his report to read it! Then he saw his forarms they were as thin as a girls were! And almost
<br>
 hairless as well, and his report it was all wrong! This wasent the report he wrote the nite before? It was all about dinosaurs and not micro genetics? And his hand
<br>
 writing was all wrong it was his but it was like his was when he was in third grade! None of this made sence to Bill! 
<br>

<br>
 Bills eyes were wide and his mind was a blank! he looked up at everyone and started to panic! &quot;COME ON BILLY TELL US MORE ABOUT DINO THE
<br>
 DINOSAUR!&quot; One of the wimpy geeks yelled up at him! Whys this geek calling me Billy I never go by that name Bill thought! Bill looked at his teacher and she
<br>
 told him to go on with his report and smiled! Bill looked back at how thin his arms now were and then back at the class &quot;I sowwwry bwt dis no mwy weport!&quot; Bill
<br>
 eyes widened as he heard his voice and speach pattern! That couldnt be the way I sound Ive got a deep voice, and a wide vocabulary! Im a smart big guy, his eyes
<br>
 welled with tears as he stood there! Then he paniced and threw his report to the floor and ran out of the room! He headed strait for the mens room he had to see
<br>
 what he looked like! What he saw when he got there shocked him! He was this skinny short geeky looking guy with thinning hair and a prominent bald area on the
<br>
 top of his head! He coundnt beleive it he was so shocked that his now weak bladder gave in to his fear and before he knew it he was pissing in his pants like a
<br>
 scred kid! Joe walked in and staired at him &quot;How do you like the way you look Bill!&quot; Joe said as he walked over to the frightened looking kid and smiled down at
<br>
 him! Bills eyes were full of tears as he had to look way up to look the now way bigger then he was Joe! &quot;Why?&quot; was all Bill could say. &quot;Theres just one more thing
<br>
 for you to see Bill!&quot; Joe said as he smiled at Bill &quot; LOOK AT THE MIRROR BILL!&quot; Joe demanded. Bill looked over at it and now he was wearing only a dieper
<br>
 and his boots, his whole body was frail and thin even the diper looked huge on him now! &quot; REMEMBER THIS BILL&quot; Joe said! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill woke up in a cold sweat in his own room at his house! His hair was soaked from sweating all night and reached up to fell the top of his head, he had a thick
<br>
 lush but wet head of hair! And his arms were as big as he remembered them to be! &quot;THANK GOD IT WAS ONLY A DREAM&quot; Was all Bill could think, he
<br>
 wipped off his coveres and staired down at his legs, they were the musculare ones he remembered and not the skinny thin ones of his dream! Man that was weird
<br>
 he thought as he reached down to scratch his balls, but as he did he noticed that his underwear and bed were soaked! He had wet his bed!</p>
