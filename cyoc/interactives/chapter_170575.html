<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a long pause as everyone waited to see who would join John if anyone in becoming either a mermaid or merman sooner. For a long time no one raised their hands only when time seamed to have passed did John’s twin sister Mary raise her hand.<br />
“I’ll go.” Said Mary as John and the rest of their family looked at her somewhat amazed. She had a lot of friends whom she wouldn’t get a chance to say goodbye to, neither would John but that was his choice to get it over and done with, Mary didn’t have to do this. She smiled as she looked at her twin brother, “We came into this world together, might as well become mermaids together.”<br />
John really wish she hadn’t said mermaids remaining him of his soon to be lost manhood. <br />
“Alright, we can have you on a flight in a few hours…there really isn’t much to pack. Like I said Salt-water doesn’t go well with most human made items and the oil on the skin of merpeople actually eat away anything not made of natural material.”<br />
“Alright…about how long until the rest of our family joins us?” inquired Mary as her mother and father nodded their approval, while her younger siblings seamed to be taken aback at all that has happened.<br />
“Once they finish all the paperwork they can join you two at any time.” Explained the Doctor “The latest they can be in 2 weeks, by then the virus will start the change no matter what.”<br />
Everyone nodded their heads, after about a half hour of saying goodbye Mary and John where boarding a small medical jet which would take them to the Key West merpeople colony. John didn’t really say anything as they traveled toward the center, for her part Mary was on her phone using it one last time to send calling and sending messages to her friends telling them goodbye. John’s phone was ringing as well, thanks to the special network on the plane he could call anyone but he didn’t want to talk to his friends. <br />
“You really should call some of your friends at least Grandma and Grandpa.” Advised Mary as she took a break from calling, she had cried a few times but was taking this a lot better then he was. <br />
“Why…why are you so calm?” inquired John “And don’t give me that bull about doing this together.”<br />
Mary shrugged as she looked back down at her phone before going on.<br />
“I have wanted to be a mermaid since I was like 5, so as much as I hate to say this but this is a dream come true to me.” Stated Mary as John glared at his sister for a moment before he took her advise and started to call his own friends and their other family members. He was semi-lucky his girlfriend and him had broken up two months ago and he hadn’t found anyone else so he didn’t have to deal with that but calling his friends and his family was hard.<br />
By the time that was done, his eyes where red with tears and he felt worn out and tired, he was emotional drain. He turned to look at his sister who was busy looking at images of different merpeople on her phone. He wanted to scream at her, to say why aren’t you angry why are you taking this so well but he couldn’t. She had given up on at least two weeks of being human so he didn’t have to go through the change alone.<br />
“So are we going to end up looking like mermaids out of a cartoon movie?” inquired John<br />
“Those appear to be the most common, some have don’t have an even line of scales which stop at the hips but other then that they are the same.” Answered Mary as she turned her phone to show him the photos. One of them looked like a live action mermaid from a Hollywood movie, one was almost identical only with scales going up in patches to her rib cage. Still another one was your classic mermaid only with the tail flipped to be more like a shark then a dolphin. One had a large fin on his back, but beside that was a classical merman and one was a mermaid only with fins on her back and on the side of her hips. None of those where bad or even that strange. <br />
Others however where alien, one looked like an eel from the waist down, one was more fish then person, one looked like a cross between a shark and a man. There where octopus ones, a lion fish one and one which looked like a whale only with gills. <br />
“Great we can be almost anything.” Stated John as the plane came in for a landing as wondered what was before them as the plan taxied to a stop beside a large hanger which sat for some reason on the beach. Above it read the sign. <br />
“Merpeople Transformation Center Key West.” <br />
“We are here.” Stated Mary as the doors opened and she headed off the plane. <br />
“Great.” Added John as he wondered what was next.<br />
What followed was a series of medical tests, getting everything from blood samples to testing their eye sight. For John he had the added fun of providing a semen sample which would be put into storage. Once all the tests were done and they got a briefing from the doctors they where lead into private locker rooms. Here John looked at himself in the mirror one last time, he was fit, while not a six pack guy he was right on the edge, he wasn’t super tall but he was over six foot and he was proud at the size of his manhood. His rich brown hair and greenish brown eyes suited him well, well they had he had no idea what they where going to be when this was all over. He put a white bath robe over his body before walking out into the hallway to find Mary waiting for him dressed in a white bath robe of her own. Her own blondish brown hair was a lot lighter than his brown and while he wouldn’t admit it she was an attractive young women. <br />
“You ready for this?” inquired Mary<br />
“No…but lets go.” Said John as the two of them headed toward the transformation chamber.</p>
