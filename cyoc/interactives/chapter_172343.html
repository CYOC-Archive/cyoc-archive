<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley opened her eyes.  &quot;Mmm, that smells great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bon appetit!&quot;  There was silence for a few minutes as they both chowed down.  Ashley seemed a bit annoyed by her shorter arms, and the fact her shirt hung on her like a tent, but due to Noah&#39;s wish, she couldn&#39;t understand what had happened.<br />
<br />
After they were done eating, Noah cleaned up, then sat down.  &quot;So Ashley, is anyone going to be worried that you&#39;re here?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  &quot;My parents basically ignore me, as long as I don&#39;t get in trouble at school or with the law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...that sucks.&quot;  Noah was starting to get a glimpse at why Ashley was the way she was.  &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t mind having you here..it&#39;s been good, talking.   And um, you&#39;re really cute, so that&#39;s a bonus.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him.  &quot;For years I hated being a shrimp.  But hearing you say that...I don&#39;t know, I kind of like being small now.  Heck, I wish I was smaller, if you like that sort of thing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...hold that thought.  Ashley, I have to admit some things to you.  But it&#39;s going to sound like something from one of my stories.  You know, like that one you read at lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...that.   Why are you even talking to me, I&#39;m the worst.&quot;  She looked down at her feet.  &quot;Huh, these shoes don&#39;t look like they fit at all.&quot;  She lifted up her foot, and the shoe dropped to the floor with a soft thud, leaving an oversized sock dangling off her foot.  &quot;That&#39;s weird..&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hm, apparently wishing someone wouldn&#39;t notice something isn&#39;t foolproof.  I need to keep that in mind.&#39;  Noah thought.  &quot;Well let&#39;s get into that.  You see, I&#39;m going to prove to you that magic is real.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up at him.  &quot;You&#39;re going to what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what that sounds like, but you&#39;ll understand soon enough.  And then you&#39;ll probably hate me again, but...well, we&#39;ll burn that bridge when we get to it.&quot;  He sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noah, I&#39;m a little scared now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, just bear with me.  How tall are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She raised an eyebrow.  &quot;I told you, I&#39;m 5&#39; 1&quot;, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot;  He took off his shoes and stood up, walking over to her.  &quot;Five foot nine and a half, if you count that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up at him curiously.  &quot;Okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now stand up for me, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
She did, and frowned, realizing her skirt and panties weren&#39;t on her legs.  She looked up at him, then back down.  &quot;I..I don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you realized how tall you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes got really wide, and she crouched down to try and pull up her skirt and panties.  &quot;Oh my God, what did you...I can&#39;t...&quot;  She looked up at him again.  &quot;You look like a giant!  What did you do to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shrank you.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll change you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
She held up a hand.  &quot;Hold on, if this is for real...and I&#39;m not like, drugged or something...let me at least stay small for a bit.  I haven&#39;t been this size in a long time, it might be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...this isn&#39;t the first wish I made.  See, I&#39;m not sure, but I found this ring...&quot;  He holds it up.  &quot;And earlier, when we ran into each other in the hallway, I made some wishes.  And they came true.  I didn&#39;t realize it then, but now I do, so I need to own up to that.  For one, I&#39;m the reason you lost your voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened.  &quot;You did say that, didn&#39;t you?  You wished I would shut up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that, but that&#39;s not the big one.  I really don&#39;t want to tell you this...since we&#39;ve gotten along so well, but what&#39;s the point of a friendship based on false pretenses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what did you do...&quot;  Then she stopped, and stared at him with her mouth forming a small &#39;o&#39;, remembering what he&#39;d said.  &quot;You wished I was the girl I used to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed heavily.  &quot;Someone I could love.  I think that&#39;s why you&#39;re feeling the way you are right now.  This isn&#39;t you either.  I&#39;ll reverse the wish now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now she held up both hands.  &quot;Woah, woah, stop!  Wait!  First of all, even if that&#39;s true...I don&#39;t want to go back to the way I was!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you didn&#39;t choose this for yourself...I did.&quot;  Noah argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe so, but I&#39;m choosing it now.&quot;  She folded her arms and set her jaw.  It was something she did whenever she was ready to dig in her heels and stand up for herself.  Many people had feared the gesture (he sure did), but now, given her current height, the effect was somewhat lost.  <br />
<br />
He must have started smiling, because she grinned.  &quot;I know, I must look ridiculous!&quot;<br />
<br />
He sobered.  &quot;But..Ashley, what if I made you love me?  That can&#39;t be right.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  &quot;No, you didn&#39;t.  I do love you.  I liked you even back in the Fifth grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!  That&#39;s insane!  What are you, some kind of tsundere girl?&quot;  Noah was shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What..oh that&#39;s the anime thing where the girl acts like she hates the guy she likes?&quot;  She blushed a bit.  &quot;It&#39;s...more complicated than that.  I&#39;ll explain everything, I owe you that much.  But the truth is...I didn&#39;t hate you so much as you reminded me of what I gave up.  I&#39;d convinced myself that being good and nice was...a weakness.  I didn&#39;t want to be weak anymore.  But no matter how hard your life was, you stayed the way you were.  Decent.  Even kind.  And you weren&#39;t weak.  You were smart, and a good runner.<br />
<br />
I tore you down because you kept proving that I was wrong.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;  I mean, what else could he say?  &quot;Are you sure about this?  I don&#39;t know that my wishes can&#39;t change the past...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noah.  Thank you for being honest with me.  This is an amazing secret, and you could have done all kinds of horrible things.  I know people who would be happy to make me love them and never look back.  Even if you did change my memories, I remember the feelings I had for you...feelings I can admit to myself now.  I don&#39;t remember not having them, and honestly, if you did take them away...no, I don&#39;t want to go back.  I don&#39;t want to treat you like that again.  If the price is I have to love you, I think I have a good deal...unless...you don&#39;t feel that way about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah sighed.  &quot;I liked the person you were.  I think I really like the person you want to be now.  It&#39;s like a friend I haven&#39;t seen in a long time just came back into my life.  And I really do think you&#39;re cute as hell.  Maybe that&#39;s not love, but it&#39;s a start.  Plus, I don&#39;t want to break your heart.  I know, that sounds odd, given how much you&#39;ve hurt me.  But I don&#39;t.  If I have to, I&#39;ll wish that I loved you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked over and hugged him, her arms not able to reach around his body.  &quot;Don&#39;t.  Not for me.  I have to earn this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached down to stroke her soft hair.  &quot;Ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, uh, I&#39;m pretty sure you like me, considering how hard your dick is.&quot;<br />
<br />
He jumped back.  &quot;Ohmygod I&#39;m sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.  Don&#39;t say you&#39;re sorry.  I like that I can make you feel that way.  It&#39;s kind of a compliment, don&#39;t you agree?&quot;  Her smile reminded him of the Cheshire Cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...I suppose?&quot;  <br />
<br />
She kicked off her other shoe, and let her skirt and panties drop to the floor.  Not that he could see much more than her legs due to her blouse.  She walked up to him, and hugged him from the side.  &quot;I know, we&#39;re far far from sex in our relationship.  But it&#39;s nice to know it&#39;s a possibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It really shouldn&#39;t be after you spread those rumors I was gay.&quot;  He grumbled, but went back to stroking her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make that up for you, too.  And to start, since you seem to really like how short I am, I&#39;m going to stay this way.  Though, I might need you to make another wish so nobody freaks out that I&#39;m a midget.&quot;  She looked up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can do that.  Oh and make your clothes fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged.  &quot;Probably a good idea, but I do like being able to wear nothing but a shirt.  It feels a little naughty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wait, people are going to pick on you if you&#39;re smaller and weaker.&quot;  Noah pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ok.  I have a knight in shining armor to protect me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Noah grumbled, knowing he was being manipulated, but not able to do much about it.  &quot;Which reminds me, Debbie.  What did she do, exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, after stripping me naked, she pushed me up against the wall and started making threats.  Then she played with my tits and...ran her finger down my body.  I thought she was going to put it inside me, but she stopped just short of that.  And she...kissed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah growled lowly.  &quot;What a bitch.  Is she a lesbian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did that line go?  You have to be human first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shawshank, nice.  So it&#39;s just a dominance thing, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged.  &quot;I mean, I&#39;m not saying she isn&#39;t interested in sex.  But yeah, definitely a way to assert her dominance.  The implied threat was she would make me her...bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, not gonna happen.  So what should we do to her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley thought about it, and then replied...</p>
