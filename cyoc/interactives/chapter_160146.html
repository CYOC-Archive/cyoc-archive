<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor would have normally never countenanced the idea of a male hookup - let alone inviting one over twice. But now, Connor was unmistakeably female. And while she was female, her body had the same unavoidable desires as when she was male. Connor moaned as she continued to touch herself. Every moment seemed to last, every sensation seemed resplendent and new. She did not want to give up on this so quickly. There were still three days left to experience womanhood. And then...then Connor would be male again.<br />
<br />
And whether she liked that, liked being a he better than being a she, would be decided on then.<br />
<br />
She found herself lounging in front of the TV and intermittently exercising, finding her exercise preferences were different now as opposed to when she was a man. Now, she was trying to maintain a trim body as opposed to having a tremendous athletic physique. And she could not wait to see if her body excited Allen the same way again. Oh by god he could not get there soon enough.<br />
<br />
Connor found herself taken by the images of the more handsome men on TV...<br />
<br />
Even in middle age, Brad Pitt still remained one of the hunkiest men to enter a set, and Connor was starting to realize an attraction. To such masculine symbols, to...to men. Whatever this meant for the male Connor, she&#39;d find out later. But there was no way she could ever give up on these feelings. They were entirely too intensive and good.<br />
<br />
That was when Connor heard the doorbell ring once then twice. Her heart jumped into her throat and she realized who it probably was. Making sure she was dressed and not unsightly, Connor headed off to the door and checked - and indeed, there stood her Asian Adonis. Clothed now even more salaciously, in a nice sleeveless crop top and skinny jeans. Connor almost moaned at the sight.<br />
<br />
She enjoyed Kendall, but sex with Allen, and experiencing his broad, muscular physique was...something else.<br />
<br />
Letting him in, Allen obviously seemed to have an inkling what his showy display did to the young woman he was meeting up with, &quot;I take it you like what you see. You&#39;ve adapted pretty well to womanhood, Connor. I&#39;m...kinda surprised by that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Connor said, blushing and looking to the side, &quot;Uh...I&#39;m going to be returning to normal in three days. And...that&#39;s that. So I wanted to---&quot; She paused and looked at him, looked at the abs he had on display, the rippling pectorals. She breathed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted,&quot; Allen said with a small smile, &quot;To get in as much of this experience as possible in these three days. And I&#39;m willing to help you out with that. But...I&#39;m glad you&#39;ll be returning back to normal. Coach has been flipping out over your &quot;illness&quot;, and I&#39;m missing my lifting bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that complicates matters. Connor looked down, and then quickly grabbed Allen&#39;s hand to guide him up to the bedroom, &quot;We can think about my return uh, when that day comes.&quot; She wanted him now, not this oblique and ominous talk. He was invited here for all of one reason. And Allen was starting to realize just how much of a libido Connor still had, and how much that was influencing her present day behaviors.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Allen stripped off his clothes one by one, first his crop top, then his jeans, and finishing by removing his tight, booty enhancing Tommy Hilfiger boxers. Once again, Connor had Allen all at her beck and call, and she started by taking that wonderful cock into her mouth. She heard Allen start to moan and groan as she took it, learning every day from her previous experiments how to go about this.<br />
<br />
He was hers today, and she was having an absolutely amazing time of it. She&#39;d never known herself to entirely be submerged in lust quite like this. Truly, the female libido was something to experience. And Connor&#39;s already sky high sex drive inserted into it unsurprisingly made her a dynamo in the sack despite her size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh fuck Connor...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you just learn every single day, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph...gotta stop, or you&#39;ll...&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor got off of Allen and then propped herself up on the bed, presenting her pussy and butt to him, all but inviting him to take her doggy style. &quot;Take me...I want you, Allen, so incredibly bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allen did not need to be told twice. Getting up behind her, he stroked his cock once, and then plunged into her pussy. Allen was not surprised that Connor was a screamer when he was getting fucked, and she was easily one of his best lays ever. Allen was increasingly sweating, feeling hot as he took her by storm. He had never had someone this into him, him, son of the car salesman!<br />
<br />
While he was still committed to getting Connor back to normal, he was also intent now on making sure he enjoyed this as much as he could. And that was going to be quite a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh fuck, Connor! I&#39;m gonna fucking cum!&quot; It would be only the first of several in a delightfully profane romp.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It was safe to say that Kendall was the sort of girl who liked to hedge her bets. She knew by now she probably had Connor&#39;s reversion arranged, and as long as he didn&#39;t do anything stupid, things were likely to return to normal before long. But the Chronivac was an unknown element in the scheme of things. It had in the space of days radically altered how her day to day life went.<br />
<br />
Connor&#39;s ways did not surprise her in the least, he was never going to be exclusive, but to know he was screwing around in a female body? It did somewhat unsettle her. Was this part of the plan Josie concocted? She had to find out more about this device. What it could do in total, where it came from, who made the damn things, and if they could be reckoned with.<br />
<br />
All that Kendall&#39;s research online told her was that it was the work of a crackpot occultist-scientist in the vain of some of the older folks in the business. Walter Eugens Kraftheim II was not the kind of man you invite to a public event. She could tell that just from his outfit in official pictures. He apparently went crazy when his father, Kraftheim I, got hauled off for being a fucking Nazi scientist.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac was his life&#39;s work, an attempt according to one intern to &quot;undo the things already done&quot;. She didn&#39;t know what that implied, but there were several takes on it. None of them very good.<br />
<br />
The thing was, even if she wanted to meet with him and try to get this more thoroughly understood, there was a problem with this. Three years ago, Walter Eugens Kraftheim II committed suicide in his laboratory, surrounded by odd, whirring gadgets and items, along with bizarre sigils and glyphs. He had written next to him in green ink; &quot;BEHOLD MY WORK&quot;.<br />
<br />
And that was where the trail ended. Nobody had been talking about him since at least 2017. There was something about a lawsuit against his estate for intellectual property, but nothing to be revealed about that. Just a severely disturbed, lonely old man who for lack of a better term rejected the world entirely. She couldn&#39;t say she pitied him pending on the interpretation of his motives, but she did see why he did what he did.<br />
<br />
This did not answer how the Chronivac was floating around in the hands of some teenage girls, but it did answer so much about its history. And why it seemed to have so much power.<br />
<br />
Kendall knew she had to try and do something about this. Before it altered and abridged people who wouldn&#39;t be quite so capable of getting their reversions arranged. She wasn&#39;t the type to moralize, she had done a lot of amoral things in her life to secure her position against those who had been cruel themselves to her, but this? It needed some restrictions, stat.</p>
