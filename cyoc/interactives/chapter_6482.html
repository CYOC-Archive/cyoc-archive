<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trip to the half Orc village was a long hike, but Brian found himself wishing it had been even longer.  As the half Orc leader walked along behind him, making lewd comments to his fellows in they're rough guttural languange.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the elf boy who likes to stare at other males loins.&quot; The Orc leader teased. Though his coomon was perfect, there was a definite guttural accent. His eyes never left Brians and the look in them was a mixture of amusement and wickedness. Brian was flustered, and didn't know what to do or say. He knew I had been staring at the big rangy half Orc, but I couldn't think of a way to play that off. The elf couldn't run because of his bonds. Given the disproportion between his light build and the Orc's powerful athletic one. The half Orc was at least four inches taller and 50 to 75 pounds heavier. He kept staring in to brian's eye's and the elf just<br />
couldn't stand it. He looked down at the ground, making the big half Orc gaffaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes, there it is!&quot; He said.  His left hand which had been<br />
casually hanging by his side, he moved overtly to his crotch and<br />
loosely cupped his hefty basket. Brian was transfixed, unconsciously his eyes moved up from his floppy elven boots to take in the outline of the Orc's package. &quot;I think you'd like to do a lot more than just stare at them!&quot; &quot;Don't you?&quot; The half Orc teased<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell to fuck the hell off Brian.&quot; Mike growled from a long distance behind. Then grunted in pain as one og his Half Orc guards slapped him roughly.<br />
<br />
The red burning of blush crawled up Brian's neck heating his face, and he imagined that he could feel it spread all over his body. Rivulets of perspiration ran between his shoulder blades and he<br />
involuntarily shivered. &quot;Listen.&quot; Brian started. &quot;I don't know what<br />
you're talking about.&quot; &quot;Fuck!&quot; He thought as his voice shook. Like that was going to be convincing.<br />
<br />
The half Orc just chuckled.  &quot;Yes..you do!&quot; &quot;I saw you looking at me from below, when you were down on the trail.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's fucking ridiculous!&quot; Brian retorted. He had been scared, but the absurdity of the Orc leaders suggestion angered him. &quot;Your the only one checking guys out in this group!&quot; Brian retorted thinking he could catch the Orc off guard with the quick change of demeanor. <br />
The big half Orc reached out and grabbed brian's arm at the elbow,  Using his momentum to swing him around. The big creature moved his left hand to brian's chest to hold him in place. In A fraction of a second his big right hand came up, then everything blurred as he delivered a stinging backhand across the elf's cheek.  Bringing involentary tears to his eyes. &quot;Don't lie to me...boy.&quot; He spat.  His right palm lifted Brian's chin and he held the elf's jaw firmly in his hand. He pressed his body into the elf and stared him in the eye. &quot;I saw it in your eyes when as you walked past me, and I see it now in your pathetic posturing.&quot; He smiled slow and wickedly. &quot;I know you want me, so now you're going to have me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't...&quot; Brian stammered.  But instantly Orc's big hand left his chest, an slid between them. Clamped onto the elf's crotch roughly.  Brian's words caught in his throat, and he lost focus again as the tears returned. There was no gentle reproach as the half Orc crushed Brian's balls through his tight leather trousers. The elf's knee's<br />
began to give out, as he clenched his eyes and opened his mouth, getting ready to wretch. Slowly Brian slid down to a kneeling postion before the huge monster. The Orc's knee's bent slightly, bracketing Brian's shoulders. So that he could maintain his iron grip as the elf gave way. His right hand left the elf's chin and<br />
buried itself tightly in his long pale hair.<br />
<br />
Once the hollow thunk of Brian's knee's hitting the hard packed ground signaled the end of his descent. The monster released his nads, and using his grip on Brian's hair. Turned his face up towards him. Brian blinked, to clear the tears from his eye's. Brian noticed the half Orc look down, and followed his gaze to the elf's own crotch. There was an obvious bulge in his tight leather trousers as his cock began to raise. Brian looked back up at him, as he felt the blush returning to his pale elven cheeks. It was greeted by the same wicked smile the half Orc had flashed earlier. Brian did want him, and wanted to do whatever the big Half Orc told him to do! But worse still the big brute knew it! It was that realization that broke the elf. Kneeling there, tears drying on his slim angluar cheeks. The wicked knowing smile on his tormentor's leering face, as he looked down at the submissive elf. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to be this ugly half Orc's toy.&quot; Brian realizied. Brian<br />
 was unsure what the monster wanted from him, but he could do almost anything! The tight grip on his hair, the sting in his pale cheek, the dull pounding in his lower abdomen. From the monster's earlier ball crushing...they all reminded him he didn't have a choice.<br />
<br />
The fact is Brian was so wrapped up in analyzing his predicament that he didn't noticed that the half Orc was talking. Until He saw the monster's thick lip's moving lips, before I actually heard him.<br />
&quot;...whatever I tell you to do, because I know that's what you want!&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn't it?&quot; The half Orc questioned, his crotch was at eye level and again he cupped his loins in one hand. Brain couldn't help but stare at it, especially as t monster had pointed his face towards it. &quot;You want this!&quot; He continued. &quot;I know you've wanted it since you saw me outside.&quot; &quot;Now tell me what you want, how you want it, and why!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian knew there was no point resisting, it would only be<br />
counter-productive. And the fact was he did want him. &quot;I want your cock.&quot; Brian stuttered realizing he still didn't even know the creature's name. &quot;What should I call him?&quot; Brian wondered silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww man!&quot; &quot;Don't give in to what he wants.&quot; Mike called, getting another solid punch for his outburst.<br />
<br />
&quot;More!&quot; The half Orc growled.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to suck it... want to taste it.&quot; Brian mumbled. &quot;I want to lick it, and have you to ram it down my throat.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And!&quot; The half Orc's wicked smile was widening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to shoot your cum inside my mouth, and make me swallow it.&quot; Brian admitted straining to look up at the half Orc, but the monster's tight grip on his hair prevented. The beast's loin's were so close Brain could almost feel the warmth of it. The monster's hand left his package, moving to the elf's pale cheek. Which he gently stroked with the back of his gnarled green fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many cocks have you sucked?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never sucked before.&quot; Brian answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe you!&quot; The half Orc said softly.  His fingers moved across the elf's cheek, and with his middle fingertip. He began to lightly trace Brian's lips, his touch almost imperceptible. Brian parted his lips slightly.</p>
