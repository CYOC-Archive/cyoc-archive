<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now,&quot; Narissa stated, rising to her full height. &quot;If you think we can manage, I believe we should train your powers once more. Care to give it a try?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded slowly, still somewhat drained from restoring Narissa to her previous adult form. &quot;I guess but what should we try?&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa smiled impishly as she looked dowm at the boy. &quot;Same transformation as before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Ty exclaimed, his eyes going wide. &quot;But Rissa I almost destroyed you last time. If I change you, make you younger, you...you would lose yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa nodded solemnly before placing her hand reassuringly on his shoulder. &quot;Yes thats true,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;But, there was a reason for that. Remember Ty you took away my ability to transform myself. When you did that you locked me into whatever form you chose. By locking me in my spirit, my soul, collapsed onto myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty rubbed his chin as he took this informatiom in. &quot;So your saying that as long as you can chamge yourself then there shouldnt be any problems if I change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa&#39;s face cracked into a warm smile as she nodded. &quot;Exactly, as long as I can reverse the effects you can do as you please. Shrink me to doll size, make me ancient, hell even put me back in my egg. The changes wouldn&#39;t be permanent because I can reverse it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded before curiously lookong at Narissa. &quot;An egg,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my people arent born as humans are,&quot; she said casually. &quot;We hatch. I was born into a litter of four. Many creatures hatch from eggs Ty. Its a common form of birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh I had no idea,&quot; Ty stated in astonishment. &quot;And you think that if I did put you back in your egg you would be able to transform back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no doubt,&quot; Narissa stated. The lizardess bkushed, her cheeks becoming slightly purple as she leaned closer to Ty. &quot;I actually asked the elders about that when I traveled there. To be honest, I rather enjoyed you making me younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty gaped as the huge lizardess smiled sheepishly smiled. The idea of actually changing Narissa once more was frightening and the thought of actually taking her back to before her birth seemed unfathomable. &quot;I dont know Rissa,&quot; he whispered. &quot;It seems pretty dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa now took Ty&#39;s hands in hers, squeezing them in reassurence. &quot;Ty I wouldnt have suggested it if I didnt know I could reverse the transformation. As long as I have my abilities I&#39;ll be okay. Besides I have faith in you, this is within your abilities and I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty sighed, Narissa&#39;s confidence in him was unshakable and emboldened him. Looking up at her he gave the lizard woman an impish smile. &quot;If I have to reraise you Narissa I am so going to ground you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mighty lizardess laughed as she held her hamd out for Ty. &quot;Its a deal,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Now what are you waiting for? Im not getting any younger...yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smirked as he now stood, taking a deep breath he now began to concemtrate on Narissa growing younger once more.<br />
<br />
Narissa smiled as she felt the tingles sweep through her body once more. &quot;Its working,&quot; she said. &quot;I can feel you changing me once more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C..can you stop it,&quot; Ty stammered. Narissa smiled nodding her head. Ty had seen the lizardess shrink ever so slightly before growing back to her full height. As that happened Ty had felt the gentlest of pushes against his power as if someone had squeezed his hand. &quot;I felt something,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that was me,&quot; Narissa stated. &quot;You see this time I have my abilities so any changes you do I can reverse. So you see, Im in no real danger.&quot; Ty nodded as he looked once more at her. &quot;Should I start again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa smiled excitedly as she nodded her head. Once more Ty now concentrated on making Narissa younger.<br />
<br />
The lizardess purred as she felt the tingles once again sweep over her powerful form. As she looked over herself she notoced the changes beginning to take effect. Her body seemed to lessen, her muscles thinning ever so slightly as she shrank in age. Looking at her hands it amazed her watching them grow steadily smaller. Looking at Ty she marveled at the fact it seemed the boy was growing, when in reality it was she that was growing smaller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your doing great Ty, &quot; she said, noticing she was now perhaps six and a half feet tall. &quot;Keep going, do not fear your power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded as he continued to concetrate. As he watched the lizardess grow smaller he found himself astonished by her transformation. Narissa was steadily growing smaller as she thinned out, her amazonian muscles grew leaner while her facial features softened as her adult maturity evapoarted. Soon the couple found theselves at eye kevel before Narissa found herself looking up at Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You knoe when this is over I may have to sample this form out,&quot; she giggled in a now youthful tone. &quot;Its a much different experience finding a human bigger than I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty laughed softly as he watche Nariss become a 15 year old lizard girl once more. Narissa head now rested around the top of Tys neck. As the two gazed at her body they noticed her small teenage breasts and narrow hips had returned once more. For Ty it was a vision he could not forget, considering this very girl had become a painful shy girl that had tried to flee earlier in the day. As they watched Narissa change they both let out an astonished gasp as Narissa grew smaller still.<br />
<br />
Narissa&#39;s height continued to plummet as her body lessened. The once proud breats if the lizard woman began to erode further, going from small mounds, to conical protrusions, to puffy nipples. Ty listened as Narissa spoke, astounded to find her voice gradually rising in pitch. It was growing softer, lighter, more childish with each passing second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Im just a child now,&quot; Narissa exclaimed with youthful vigor as the last of her breasts evaporated into her chest. Looking at Ty she was astounded to see she was eye level with his belly button. &quot;And your getting....really big!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you...still you Rissa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa nodded happily as she continued to watch herself grow smaller. &quot;Yes definetly,&quot; she chirped. &quot;The changes are different than last time. It feels like when I transform myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ty ssaid looking down at the young lizard girl. &quot;You were adorable at this age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa giggled girlishly as she looked up at Ty. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she smiled, her cheeks turning the slightest purple. &quot;Im probably close to 6 or 7 in human years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded as he marveled at the girl. He had begun to notice how soft Narissa&#39;s scales seemed to be becoming. The formerly rough looking scales appeared almost baby soft. Reavhing a tentative hand out he touched the lizard girls scales, finding them to be as smooth as corinthian leather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey that tickles,&quot; Narissa giggled as she squirmed in place. &quot;Saurian scales are very sensitive when were young.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blushed, apologizing sincerely as an impish idea crossed his mind. Tickling Narissa could be quite fun fown the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I can read your thoughts Ty,&quot; Narissa giggled as she now found her height below Ty&#39;s waist. Ty blushed crimson, apologizing profusely as the little girl held up one if her small hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dont hafta pologize,&quot; she said, surprised to find her voice and sentences sounded so childish. &quot;I unnastand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nariss are you okay,&quot; Ty asked, concerned at her speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ok,&quot; she chirped. &quot;I just wittle. Imma toddler now Ty. I can be more dan 3 now in human years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty starwd in wonder as he gazed the thw toddler Narissa. The lizard girl was barely knee high to him now and still growing smaller. As she looked up at him and smiled Ty noticed he once intimidating adult lizard teeth had been replaced with small, childish needle teeth. The type of teeth one would expect to see on a puppy.<br />
<br />
Narissa giggled as she now tried to babble to Ty. Pausing the girl giggled once more, trying to communicate to Ty she was now too young to speak.  Ty gazed in wonder, watching as the lean muscle on the girl continued to lessen. Ty was astonished at how skinny the girl seemed.<br />
<br />
Narissa wobbled on thin legs before falling flat onto her skinny lizard rear. Giggling like the infant she was Ty watched as the lizard baby now crawled towards Tys leg placing a tighter hug than he would of expected on his leg.<br />
<br />
As Narissa continued to inch backwards towards birth Ty watched as the lizard baby smiled up at him with a toothless maw before beginning to curl into a ball. Narissa now happily sucked her thumb as she drew herself up into a ball. In compkete contentment Ty watched as the lizard baby seemed to curl up before happily closing her eyes and seeming to drift off to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Riss you sleeping,&quot; Ty asked. Narissas soft snores were barely audible to Ty. The small girl smiled as if havong a pkeasant dream. Ty marveled at the soft greenish yellow color of her scales. Chancing a touch he reached towarda the sleeping infant, finding her body to be incredibly smootb. Sonn though Ty was asrpumded to see somwthing beginning to fiem aroumd Narissa.<br />
<br />
At first Ty thought he was imaging things as it appeared a membranr was forming around Narissa. The membrane though soon surrounded the girl and begam to grow thicker. Ty watched as Narissa apeeared to stop breathing as a yolk sack seemed to grow around her navel, cinnected by some sort of umblical cord. At first Ty was alarmed but a voice that seemd to be a whisper in his head told him everyrhing was okay. Despite being a near fetus Narissa seemdd to tell him everything was okay. As he watched the girl he noticed the membrane was now thickening, becoming opaque. In seconds Ty was unablr to see the young Narissa, instead Ty now beheld a lizard egg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Ty breathed, stopping Narissas regression. &quot;You werrnt kidding, you really were born from an egg.&quot; Picking the egg up Ty was amazed that the shell felt incredibly tough. While unsure he believed that even if he dropped it by mistake it would not break. &quot;So when you changing back Rissa,&quot; he questioned, becoming slightly worried.<br />
<br />
Ty felt the egg begin to move as if to answer his question. Gently placing the egg on the floor Ty watched as small cracks began to appear. In what only seemed seconds Ty watched as the egg crackrd open and a small lizard burst forth, which rapidly grew back in to adulthood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Narissa exclaimed. &quot;That was definitely interesting.&quot; Turning back towards an astonished Ty she smiled as her large lizard hands caressed Ty&#39;s cheek. &quot;Impressive Ty,&quot; she smiled warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ty whispered. &quot;By the way I can easily say you have always been adorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Narissa laughed softly before placing a gentle kiss on Tys cheek. &quot;Your too kind,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Now, what else shall we practice today?&quot;</p>
