<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle asked, &quot;Transform or Dare?, Miss Jennifer.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare, Kyle,&quot; replied Jennifer.  He answered her, &quot;Miss Jennifer, I dare you to say the line back to me.&quot;  Jennifer smiled and said, &quot;The line.&quot;  A split second after she said it, she wondered why the hell she said that.  Liz laughed and said, &quot;Jenn, you told him to dare you to say 'the line' back to him.  So he did, and so did you.&quot;  Jennifer threw her arms up, and wailed, &quot;Oh just great, now the whole thing is fucking ruined.&quot;  She started to storm off angrily.<br />
<br />
Jamie quickly stood up and stopped her.  &quot;No it isn't, Jenn.  He passed the curse back to you.  Just because he didn't tell you to say it right back to him doesn't mean that anything is ruined.  You can still curse him.&quot;  Jennifer, who always recognized that Jamie was smarter than her, realized she was right.  &quot;Oh thank God,&quot; she said, sighing heavily.  &quot;Thanks Jamie.&quot;  Now turning back to Kyle she said, &quot;Before we continue there are a few questions I need ask you.  Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he said.  &quot;First of all,&quot; she began, &quot;do you know why we're here?&quot;  &quot;Yes, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he answered, &quot;you're here because I cursed you this morning.&quot;  She then asked, &quot;Can you remember everything that you've ever done up to this point?&quot;  &quot;Yes, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he replied.  <br />
<br />
She continued her questions, all of which they had planned out earlier in the day.  &quot;Now then, when will your parents be home?&quot; she asked.  Kyle said, &quot;Probably not until 6 o'clock or so, Miss Jennifer.&quot;  &quot;These are important questions,&quot; she said.  &quot;Did you like being able to fuck me?&quot;  &quot;Oh, yes, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he said.  &quot;Would you like to do it again sometime?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Definitely, Miss Jennifer,&quot; he told her.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then said, &quot;Kyle, you can stop calling me Miss Jennifer now.  Thanks.  Now then, are you still mad at me for what I did to you?  Please be honest.&quot;  He looked down at his feet, as if he hoped the answer would spring up from the floor.  He said, &quot;I don't know.  Yes and no.&quot;  &quot;Why is that?&quot; she wondered.  &quot;I'm mad at you for humiliating me,&quot; he told her, &quot;but I'm also not since you let me fuck you.  And because you could've turned me into a toad or something like that, but you haven't.&quot;  &quot;Do you remember what I told you about being popular and everything after we're done?&quot; she asked.  He simply nodded his head.  &quot;Would you still like to be?&quot; she said.  &quot;Well, are you going to be my friend?&quot; he asked.  Jennifer replied, &quot;We all are.  Right, girls?&quot;  He looked at them, all still sitting on the couch.  They all nodded, saying &quot;Yea, sure, of course.&quot;  He told Jennifer, &quot;Yea I guess I would like to be popular then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now came the important part.  Jennifer told him, &quot;You have to accept a change then, OK?&quot;  His mind was in torment.  He didn't really want to say yes, feeling he would still be unable to trust her.  He clutched his head again, and said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  Jennifer changed her wording.  &quot;Kyle, you will become popular like us, and you will accept a change to do so.&quot;  Kyle stopped clutching his head, and replied, &quot;Yes, I will.&quot;  Jennifer laid it down for him.  &quot;OK then, Kyle, I'm going to ask you the question, and you have to say Transform.  Everything will be fine.  We aren't going to hurt you, and you will love our results.  After it is done, we'll share our world with you.&quot;  A tear rolled from his eye.  He was still trying to fight it, but could not for the power of the dare.  &quot;OK, Jennifer,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then Kyle, from now on call me Jenn.  OK?&quot; she said.  &quot;Yes, Jenn,&quot; he replied.  She asked the question.  &quot;Kyle Perkins, Transform or Dare?&quot;  Once again, he clutched his head, before his lips said, &quot;Transform.&quot;  Jennifer and her friends had carefully arranged how the curse would be read.  There could be no going back once it was said.  It was up to Jennifer to get it right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Kyle.  Now as I said we won't hurt you.  And I'm not really mad at you anymore.  You helped to bring me and my three closest friends even closer to each other.  And we had some fun doing it.  So we decided that you should join our little circle, since it was thanks to you that all of this happened.&quot;  Kyle looked stunned.  He wasn't sure what the hell she was talking about.  &quot;But, she said, we really can't have a male be in our circle.&quot;  Kyle's eyes widened with fear.  He could figure out what that meant.  &quot;Kyle, in just a minute my three friends here are going to get up, one at a time, and do a striptease for you.  Each time you see them take off an article of clothing, one part of your body will transform from male to female.&quot;  His eyes widened.  She continued, &quot;That's right, Kyle.  You are going transform into a young, healthy, sexy, beautiful girl just like the rest of us, but...you will keep the intelligence level you now possess, since you're smarter than we are.  You will also keep your past memories and experiences.  And most importantly, the only people who will have any memories of Kyle Perkins after you have completely turned into a female will be you, me, Trish, Liz, and Jamie.  That will take care of any problems with your parents, and the rest of the world remembering you as Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now more tears began to well up in Kyle's eyes.  He started to protest.  &quot;But...I-I don't w-want to be a girl.&quot;  Jennifer rolled her eyes, and said &quot;You don't have a choice now Kyle.  You agreed to it.  It will happen as soon as their clothes come off.  And even if you were able to break through my control of you, we'd force you to see the clothes come off.  Besides, I'm sure the maleness that will remain inside you wants to see my three lovely friends in their birthday suits just like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tears rolled down his cheeks.  &quot;I don't know.  I--&quot;  Just then Jamie stepped up and interrupted.  &quot;Kyle, look.  I know that this might seem unfair.  But it will be great.  We do everything together, we always look out for each other, we are always there for each other.  Once you've changed, you'll have four friends that will never abandon you.  How many people can you say that for now?&quot; she asked.  &quot;No one, really,&quot; he said.  Jamie continued, &quot;Besides it's not like you could never be male again.  We think we've figured out this curse pretty well.  Not only that, but we've decided that we're all going to get together one day or one night each week for a couple of hours to use the curse for fun.  You'll be a part of that now.  Isn't that right, Jenn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked somewhat mad at Jamie for that last bit.  It was true, they had discussed doing that, but no one said they definitely would.  But then she figured, she probably would have agreed to, and Jamie was only trying to calm Kyle down.  She spoke up.  &quot;Yes, Kyle.  Everything that Jamie said is true.  I'm telling you that what she said is true.&quot;  Hearing it from her, Kyle was able to accept it since he was still under Jennifer's control.  His tears stopped, and he was able to crack a smile.  Then she added, &quot;Oh, and of course once you've changed I'll make sure you aren't under my control anymore.&quot;  &quot;How?&quot; he asked.  She joked, &quot;Well, duh.  I thought you were smart.  Seriously, just Dare me too after you've changed.  You're still under my control, so when you've become Kylie Perkins, your new name, you will dare me to release you from my control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle liked the sound of Kylie.  It sounded exotic.  He figured if he was going to be beautiful, he might as well have a name that fits it.  Jennifer interrupted his thought.  &quot;OK,&quot; she said, &quot;we have to get this done before your parents get home.  Here's the deal.  Pick what order you want them to strip in.&quot;  He thought for a second.  He knew Trish was the hottest of the group, though they all were pretty hot.  There was something about Jamie that he liked.  Probably her kindness and understanding.  So he decided upon Trish, then Liz, and finally, Jamie.  But he still didn't know Liz's or Jamie's names.  &quot;I'm sorry if this seems silly,&quot; he said, &quot;but I only know Jenn and Trish by name.&quot;  They all laughed, and Liz and Jamie told them their names.  &quot;OK,&quot; he said, &quot;First Trish, then Liz, then Jamie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at Trish and said, &quot;Come on up here and show him your stuff.&quot;  Trish smiled seductively and rose up from the couch.  Jennifer took her place on the couch, as Trish went and stood where Jennifer had been standing this whole time.  Then she started to dance.</p>
