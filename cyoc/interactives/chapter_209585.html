<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Owen put his hands greedily on Troy’s back, “You know kid, I really can’t get you outta my head. Can’t focus on my work”<br />
<br />
Troy felt Owen’s meaty hands push into Troy’s hard back, his boss really seemed to love him. Troy couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. Owen’s presence over Troy gave him full control do whatever he wanted. Owen moved up and down Troy’s body slowly, feeling the coarse rough skin, his dick moved in and out rhythmically inside the Rhox’s hole. Troy could feel himself shake and stifled a moan, trying to keep as quiet as he could. Hot air escaping from his parted lips. Owen grinned as he made Troy his complete toy. <br />
<br />
He laughed, “Maybe I’ll call you Toy from now on instead of Troy.”<br />
<br />
Troy couldn’t think, his legs quaked with ecstasy, he was going to cum. Owen grunted as his thrusts grew deeper and more forceful. Troy couldn’t help it, he exploded all over the barrier they were hiding behind, sticky white painting the solid concrete. Owen wasn’t far behind, letting out his own moan as he sprayed his seed inside Troy. Troy felt the rush of cum leak out his hole as Owen slowed down. Owen caught he breath, leaning down onto Troy, kissing his back repeatedly.<br />
<br />
As Troy began to regain his focus, he looked around to make sure no one had seen them. He then saw a person over by their clothes, someone was fucking with their stuff! <br />
<br />
Troy called out, “Hey stop it! What do you think you’re doing.?”<br />
<br />
“Let ‘em have their fun, pervert ain’t doing nothing. And I’m not done with you yet.” Owen pulled Troy back into a tusky kiss.<br />
<br />
The massive ogre started pounding Troy’s ass again, holding him firm so that Troy couldn’t move. Troy struggled, fighting the returning pleasure from Owen’s cock. What if someone got his book! Who was touching their stuff? <br />
<br />
“It’s gonna be alright.” Owen nibbled on his ear, making Troy moan. “If we have to work nude, we work nude, okay?”<br />
<br />
Troy groaned and pushed back into the thick dick ramming his donut hole. He thought he heard someone say something behind him, but whatever it was got drowned out by Owen’s heavy breathing and grunts of pleasure. The ogre had him clasped tight to his sweaty, hairy gut, cock firmly sliding in and out of him, pleasantly stretching his hole and prodding his prostate in ways that had him light-headed and delirious with pleasure.<br />
<br />
The Rhox reached behind him with both hands and clasped them around the ogre’s vast hips, fingers barely touching each other. Owen held him tighter as Troy lifted his legs between the ogre’s and caught them with his hands. Now he was just a package being humped vigorously by his boss.<br />
<br />
Owen moaned and pressed himself deeper into Troy. Troy’s hole began to feel oddly dry as the cock seemed to slip further into him without resistance. The flesh around his hole was transforming into plush cotton fabric, though the sensation was lost to the big Rhox. His arms and legs were already beginning to thin into stretchy elastic, fusing together to form straps.<br />
<br />
The ogre thrust further, cock grinding so far into him that Troy that he swore it was hitting his lungs. He groaned wheezily, air leaving a throat that was growing dry and parched. The fabric continued up his form, gray, leathery skin becoming soft and white stretchy fabric. All Troy could feel was an odd sensitivity spreading through him. Every thrust started to tug him closer, compacting him further into the Ogre’s big crotch. His body wracked and distorted with pleasure from each tug.<br />
<br />
“God, I’m so glad I got a new jockstrap.” The orc above him boomed.<br />
<br />
Jockstrap? <br />
<br />
Horror cut through the pleasant sensations as Troy realized what was happening to him. A Book owner had cast a spell on him, he hadn’t heard it, and now reality was altering, erasing his existence and replacing him with a jockstrap. He struggled, trying to get away from the massive ogre, but the strong, firm hands that were cupping him tight to Owen’s crotch were unrelenting and his own arms wouldn’t unclasp his feet where they had bent oddly between the ogre’s legs.<br />
<br />
Owen groaned at the sensations of Troy’s wriggling and his hand cupped around the increasingly small man.  The former Rhox could feel the cock stretching his fibers just beneath his neck, his view of the concrete block shifting lower and lower with each passing second. He leaned his head back, brushing against the treasure trail on the ogre’s sweaty belly, and realized he was shrinking.<br />
<br />
His ass felt like it was cupping the ogre’s balls, the heavy orbs straining his fabric pleasantly. Musk and sweat and precum were soaking into him as he became more absorbent, and his thoughts began to muddle with each thrust. Troy could feel the cock press onward into his head, and thinking became harder.<br />
<br />
“Aw, fuck!’ Owen murmured, hand beginning to move, jerking himself off through the fabric of his ‘jockstrap’.<br />
<br />
The ogre’s great cock pressed further and further in and Troy’s face distorted, horns flattening into fabric like the rest of him.  He could feel the pulse of the ogre’s orbs, the throb of the huge dick filling up the space where his brains had been. The ogre bucked and everything stretched, his mind muddled by the cascade of pleasure. The big thick cock pushed out any thought he had, filling his mind of the mental image of the musky dick behind his eyes.<br />
<br />
Troy could no longer focus on the changes, feeling so pleasantly taut and stretched out. He was snug under the overhang of the ogre’s belly, sweat pooling into his fabric. His mind was a mess, then the cock twitched, spurting precum, and all he felt was good and sweaty and musky. Troy made one last effort to get away, squirming, and the ogre groaned.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, I’m going to break you in, wear you all day.” Owen moaned, meaty fist a blur as he rubbed his cock through his new jockstrap.<br />
Troy tried to move again, to get through to the ogre, but his cock was so hard it stretched his seams to their limits. The cock jumped and sent some more pre into his fabric, and Troy couldn’t think much anymore. It felt like it was his own cock the ogre was rubbing, except his cock was his entire body. <br />
<br />
His wearer groaned and twitched, more warm wetness filling him. The jockstrap couldn’t think much anymore, all it could do was support the hefty groin of its wearer. It could feel the heavy balls begin to tense and knew its owner would be coming soon.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Owen grunted and came.<br />
<br />
The jockstrap felt the owner’s massive cock flex and tense rhythmically, cum filling his insides, filling his mind. It was warm a delicious and musky and he couldn’t think any more. His mind was filled with a cock that spasmed over and over and then all his thoughts were pushed away by the cum. <br />
<br />
Owen panted, feeling strangely satisfied, and walked back over to the crate where he’d left his clothes. His jockstrap squished pleasantly against his crotch, the cum beginning to cool. He smirked and squeezed his package, cum dribbling through the fabric and falling to the asphalt. <br />
<br />
The ogre paused when he reached the crate. For some reason, he’d thought there would have been two sets of clothes here. It was silly, of course. He always found a place to get naked and jerk off, watching Shiloh work, enjoying the big grizzly’s form. What he wouldn’t give to plow that furry hole. <br />
<br />
He thought he saw a fat nerd waddling away down the street, a big leather book tucked under his flabby arm.  Something about a pervert fucking with their clothes flashed through his mind, but that was silly. His clothes were right where he’d left them, wallet was full of cash. He was fine.<br />
<br />
Owen pulled his pants up over his squishy jockstrap and got back to work.</p>
