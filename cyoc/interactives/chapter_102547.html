<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay. So.&quot; Rachel huffed. Julie sat next to her in her bedroom, on the bed. &quot;What do we do?&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie shrugged, but held a focused look on her face. She eyed Rachel&#39;s waxy skin and and strange pale complexion. &quot;Well first of all, since these things act as aphrodisiacs, it&#39;s important that we stay focused and try to not enjoy your changes too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; Rachel said, with a sigh, remembering how she&#39;d acted when she tried the last milkshake.<br />
<br />
Julie huffed and looked over the chocolates. She picked out a white chocolate FAT piece. &quot;As hot as you were chubby, I think it&#39;s important we get you as normal as we can.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rachel nodded as Julie positioned herself to drop it into Rachel&#39;s mouth. She opened wide and Julie watched with bizarre fascination as small tendrils extended from Rachel&#39;s tongue, reaching the chocolate before it reached its destination. She closed her mouth and thinned out a little. Julie fed her several more until she was just about her normal weight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boobs too!&quot; Julie jokingly demanded, picking up the white chocolate breasts. Rachel began to lighten up and said her first lighthearted thing in a while. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww!&quot; She said, half-smiling.<br />
<br />
Julie fed her the white chocolate breasts and after a few, those were normal too. But now they were back to square one. They had to figure out what Julie put in that milkshake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know I was looking for the FAT chocolate.&quot; Julie pointed, identifying the small piece. Beside it was it&#39;s companion, the white chocolate piece. Above that sat the Growth piece and it&#39;s companion. Below those were something that looked like a white and dark chocolate foot. On the other side was the edge of the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know for sure it wasn&#39;t that one,&quot; Julie said, checking Rachel&#39;s ever-tiny feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, still freakishly small!&quot; Rachel said laughing, now feeling even more lighthearted. She felt they were making good progress. That did give her an idea for later though...<br />
<br />
Rachel spied something to the right of the white chocolate growth piece, and pointed. It appeared to simply be a Dark chocolate ball with a dot in the middle. It didn&#39;t appear to be any sort of body part at all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what&#39;s tha----!&quot; As she extended her hand and accidentally poked the chocolate. Normally this wouldn&#39;t mean anything,  but since Rachel was absorbing and dissolving everything, it immediately entered her system. <br />
<br />
This caused what appeared to be a loophole in the boxes &#39;programming.&#39; Since Rachel absorbed it so quickly, and the chocolates were self-replicating and endless, it threw Rachel&#39;s system into a frenzy.<br />
<br />
Rachel immediately felt it, her body began to expand again and bloat outwards. Julie jumped off the bed and immediately saw what was different. She wasn&#39;t getting fatter, she was blowing up like a deflated ball! <br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel!&quot; Julie yelled, as her lover&#39;s body expanded outwards, her belly pushing out from the between the shorts she&#39;d put on to leave the house, and the loose red tank top she wore to cover her breasts. &quot;Rachel you have to let go!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Urgh!&quot; Rachel yelled. &quot;I can&#39;t! I feel stuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie saw Rachel&#39;s hand pull away but there were tendrils extending from her finger stretching and binding themselves to the box. Rachel&#39;s shorts popped open as her belly pushed out almost a full foot from her body. Her chest heaved as she morphed, her ass bloated out sideways, straining at the seams of the shorts. Her expansion began to push upwards from her belly, reaching her chest, but instead of her breasts inflating, her whole chest barreled out as they disappeared within the swelling. After what appeared to be only seconds, the tank top burst at the seams and landed in a sad pile in front of her.Her arms began to rise up, lifting the chocolates up with them, just out of Julie&#39;s reach as her legs began to involuntarily spread. Julie could only watch in terror as filled out more and more. She was horrified to be in a room with Rachel in such an expansive and destructive state. <br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s thigh&#39;s began to fill out, blowing apart her poor jean shorts. Whatever was filling her flowed downwards continuing to her calves and as well as rising up into her upper arms. She tried to flail her hand wildly to remove the chocolates, but it only ended up sending chocolates everywhere around the room. <br />
<br />
She continued to swell as her limbs began to become part of her body, pulling inward and becoming completely round and puffy, just like the rest of her inflating body. Rachel wept as she grew upwards. The swelling had now completely overtaken her neck, leaving her with only her head, hands and feet at her disposal. Julie didn&#39;t know if she could expand anymore but she knew she needed to act. She looked around the room for some way to get the chocolates. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t see any options until she saw one of the chocolates that Rachel had flung with her flailing. It was a dark chocolate growth one. That was perfect. But she knew she didn&#39;t have much time and quickly threw it into her mouth. She popped a few inches, but it clearly wasn&#39;t enough. &quot;Rachel!&quot; she shouted towards to swelling girl. &quot;You need to flail around more! I need you to send those chocolates flying!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rachel had nearly no movement now, as even her palms began to swell. She weakly wiggled her fingers, sending a couple chocolates down to the ground in front of her. Her mass was still spreading, and Julie had to be very careful to try and retrieve those. Rachel&#39;s head was nearly at the ceiling once more and she watched as it loomed closer and closer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help me!&quot; she screamed. Julie refocused herself, prepared and sprang for the chocolates on the ground. She retreated back to the other side of room breathlessly and hastily searched her hand and saw 4 more GROW chocolates. That was only 8 inches or so, but it would have to do. <br />
<br />
She threw them into her mouth and waited, as she pushed upwards. Rachel swelled outwards covering more than half the room once more. Her shape almost completely spherical. Her head bumped the roof lightly as she struggled.<br />
<br />
Finally Julie hit the height of 6&#39;2&#39;&#39; up from her previous 5&#39;8&#39;&#39;, took a deep breath and  took a run at it. She eyed the chocolates,  leapt up upon the bed, launched herself towards the chocolates and -</p>
