<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Daniel arrived at the front door, he was worried about being seen by his mother with wet pants and a GoodNites instead of his underwear. <br />
He saw the light on in the living room and imagined his mother watching her favorite TV series. <br />
His mother, Susan, was 41 years old, and a widow. Daniel&#39;s father had died when Daniel was two years old in a car accident. Since his mother did not remarry, Daniel was an only child and had no brothers or sisters. The mother was the owner of the real estate agency that had been founded by her and her husband.<br />
As he approached the door, he noticed that the curtains in the living room were drawn, and that he could see his mother, sitting in her armchair, facing the television. <br />
The boy thought of entering the house and after greeting his mother quickly and from afar, quickly going up to the bathroom where he could take off his pants and wet GoodNites. Then he would throw the wet garment in the trash can and then take a bath. That way, his mother would never notice. <br />
Daniel, before entering, tightened his thighs together, to make his wet pants more invisible, and slowly and quietly opened the front door and entered the house. He turned around, and, closing the door slowly, tried to lock it as silently as possible.<br />
&quot;Hello, Daniel.&quot; Susan said to her son, smiling and turning to him. &quot;Did you have a good time with Matt?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, mom.&quot; Daniel replied, a little uncomfortable. &quot;Good evening, mom.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, sweetheart?&quot; Susan asked, getting up and approaching her son.<br />
&quot;N-no, Mom...&quot; Daniel replied, turning to her and showing the front of his pants wet.<br />
&quot;Oh, Danny... You wet your pants again...&quot; said his mother. <br />
Daniel&#39;s eyes widened at those words &quot;You wet your pants again...&quot;, again... But if the last time he wet his pants was in kindergarten... And now for his mother, it&#39;s as if was it something unpleasant but frequent? What did that mean?&quot; Daniel wondered, looking at his mother with a perplexed expression. <br />
Susan noticed his bewildered expression, and asked him: &quot;Why are you looking at me like that, Danny? Is something wrong?&quot; she said, placing a hand on her son&#39;s cheek. &quot;I told you a GoodNites wouldn&#39;t last an entire afternoon...&quot; she said, shaking her head, and then, placing her hand on the boy&#39;s buttocks, she said, &quot;Feel it, it&#39;s all wet!&quot; She added, squeezing his GoodNites-filled ass, and then giving him a light spanking. <br />
The mother, noticing her son&#39;s puzzled look, continued: &quot;Why are you looking at me like this, Danny?&quot; She said, stroking his hair. &quot;Go upstairs and get out of your pants, and put the wet ones in the laundry basket. Then, while I&#39;m preparing dinner, I want you to take a shower, okay? I&#39;ll tell you when it&#39;s ready.&quot; She concluded, kissing her son on the cheek. &quot;I hope you like pasta with meat sauce tonight.&quot; She added, as she went back to the kitchen.<br />
Daniel, still dazed, watched his mother leave the room. He was stunned, but also happily surprised. <br />
His mother looked like if she was used to the fact that her son was still wearing diapers and even wetting himself, and seemed to consider it something that happened often. Soon after Daniel thought it was part of Madame Illusia&#39;s exchange with Matt. “So… Now, for everyone, I&#39;m the kid who wears GoodNites... and wets them, while Matt is the normal boy... and I&#39;m his bedwetter friend...&quot; the boy thought. It was a strange and exciting thought, and he could not wait to find out the other effects of the exchange with Madame Illusia.<br />
He went up the stairs and, entering his bedroom and put his backpack next to his bed. <br />
His gaze lingered on the floor, next to the wardrobe, was a diaper-pail. Daniel smiled at the sight and walked closer. <br />
He opened it and was surprised to see that in the diaper-pail were GoodNites and... diapers? “But…Matt has only been using GoodNites for…years.” Daniel thought, surprised to find diapers. He expected to find only GoodNites in the diaper-pail, but, instead, he saw, along with the GoodNites, a series of disposable diapers. Daniel did not know why, but he felt strangely excited, “So mom thinks… I need more than just GoodNites...&quot; he thought, touching the plastic covering the diapers, and imagining what they would look like. <br />
He opened the closet and saw three packages of diapers and two of GoodNites on the shelf. <br />
A package for each were already opened and some were missing, the boy understood that it was the supply that his mother had purchased for him. Daniel decided to open his underwear drawer, and didn&#39;t find even a pair of boxers or briefs. &quot;Matt wore underwear several times... I remember that. I went to his house very often, and he had several pairs of underwear... at home he only wore underwear, never GoodNites... But ... wow! It means that from now on, I&#39;ll wear only diapers and GoodNites.&quot; Daniel thought, with a grin. &quot;No more ugly, boring briefs for me, then.&quot;<br />
Daniel, still with a smile on his lips, picked up a clean GoodNites, and then left the room, and entered the bathroom. <br />
He placed on the washbasin the clean GoodNites, and, started to untied his sneakers. He took them off and put them near the tub, and then pulled his socks and threw them in the laundry bin. Then, began to undo his pants, unbuttoning and lowering the fly. <br />
He felt a little strange to undress and remove his pants while still wearing his wet GoodNites, but it was a nice and pleasant feeling. He bent down and lowered his pants, pulling them down, and, once he reached his ankles, he sat down and removed his pants, taking them off completely, and then stood up. He picked up the pants, and, throwing them into the laundry basket. Then, he looked at the wet GoodNites, and, blushing, lowered them. When he was done, he was naked from the waist down. <br />
Daniel was not particularly hairy, and had sparse pubic hair, which did not go unnoticed. He looked down and was fascinated to see his penis so small. He remembered how big it was a few hours ago, before the change, and could not believe that he had a two-inch penis. It was so small that it almost did not stick out, and had a cute and adorable shape. The boy took off his shirt and threw it in the laundry basket too, and, with the GoodNites still in his hands, entered the shower and closed the glass door behind him. He opened the water and waited for it to warm up, then he turned on the shower and, closing his eyes, let the warm water wet his hair, then he looked down at his tiny penis. &quot;My dick is really very small!&quot; He exclaimed, looking down at his groin and grabbing his little member between his fingers. It was strange and embarrassing to see that he had a tiny dick, and compared it to how it was until a few hours earlier. &quot;it&#39;s less than half the size ... it&#39;s so small... I can&#39;t even jerk off properly!&quot;.<br />
After a few minutes, Daniel finished washing, and, closing the water, he came out of the shower and grabbed the towel. He dried his hair, and, when he was done, he proceeded to dry the rest of his body. <br />
Once finished, he picked up the clean GoodNites and unfolded it. The boy placed his feet in the right holes and then lifted his legs, putting his feet in the correct holes. Then he bent down and pulled the GoodNites up to his thighs, and finally adjusted the elastic bands, which fit tightly against his skin. <br />
He returned to his room, and opened the wardrobe, looking for something to wear. A pair of blue sweatpants and a T-shirt caught his eye, and he picked them up and put them on. He was not going out and his mother was at home, so there was no need to dress smart. He left the bedroom and went down the stairs, entering the kitchen.<br />
&quot;Do you need help, mom?&quot; Daniel asked, watching his mother finish making the pasta. Susan, turning, smiled, and replied: &quot;No thanks, dear, I&#39;m done.&quot; His mother replied, pouring the pasta into a pot of boiling water. &quot;Sit down, dinner will be ready soon.&quot; She added, placing the pan on the stove. After a few minutes, the dinner was ready.</p>
