<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"You know. This hot bod." Troy turned back towards the mirror and undid the button of her short shorts, followed by the noise of the zipper.<br>
<br>
At was at this point that a fog lifted from Will's mind. "Whoa, what the hell are you doing!?" He grabbed her hands to stop her from undressing herself further.<br>
<br>
Troy struggled to get free. "I just wanna see my pussy, Will. Goddamnit, let me go!" It was to no avail, as he was already dragging her out of the bathroom and back to the computer.<br>
<br>
Will planted her on a chair and accessed the chronivac program. "Troy, this program is making you act weird. It's not right."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, it made me into a succubus. And —Oh no!— it's making me act like one," said a disgruntled looking Troy.<br>
<br>
"Look at this!" With a click of the mouse Will showed the 'mental' tab. "It changed your mind." He pointed at the section labeled 'sexuality'. There were two bars, both at 100%: one with a male symbol, the other with a female symbol. An accompanying label said: 'strongly bisexual'. "It made you bi," he told the blue demoness, "And look here. It gave you a female gender identity!" He scrolled down to the gender identity section. Again, there were two bars, but only the one with the female symbol was at 100%. The label said: 'strongly female'.<br>
<br>
Troy looked away, a frown on her face. "Damnit, Will..."<br>
<br>
"And look at this," Will had scrolled down to the 'special qualities' section and began reading them out, "'Succubi are beings with a strong sexuality. They are more confident in sexual situations that would leave ordinary people uncomfortable and are skilled at creating sexual tension.' Do you get that it makes you act like a horny slut? This isn't you."<br>
<br>
After a few fleeting moments that nonetheless felt awkwardly long, Troy spoke up. "Can you access my original profile?"<br>
<br>
Will sighed. "Okay, but I don't see the point." With a single mouse click he brought up Troy's data from before the change. The special qualities section simply said 'standard human', but the gender identity section was the first surprise. 69.3% male, and 30.7% female, the label said 'gender queer, mostly male'. He was silent for a moment. "I... I had no idea."<br>
<br>
"Wasn't so sure myself," his roommate said, "Guess that's why I feel better in this body. What with becoming 100% female and all." On her face, a look was beginning to form that Will couldn't quite read. It looked like sadness, but could just as well be unease. "Why don't you scroll up?"<br>
<br>
78.5% at the male bar, and 83.2% at the female bar. The label denoted that the pre-transformation Troy was bisexual. Immediately, Will felt embarrassed about his earlier comment. "Oh, damn. I said it made you bi when you already were. Sorry, man. I had no idea."<br>
<br>
The corners of Troy's mouth curled up in a sad smile. "It's alright. I can tell you're not a bigot."<br>
<br>
"You're not hurting anyone with liking guys. The fundies can fuck themselves."<br>
<br>
The smile on Troy's lovely face was starting to look pained. "Would it hurt you if it was you who I liked?"<br>
<br>
Will was quiet, and Troy could almost hear the gears turning in his head. A tear rolled down her cheek, more soon followed. "I thought that if I turned into a beautiful woman you'd be attracted to me," the succubus continued, "I just wanted to know how it would feel to have your attention, to flirt with you without you being grossed out. And maybe, just maybe..." She wiped the tears from her cheek. "Maybe we could have had sex." Her black and yellow eyes turned away again. "I'm sorry," she said in her trembling voice.<br>
<br>
After a long silence, Will nodded and inhaled through his nostrils. "S'alright," he said as he exhaled, "To be honest, I was thinking with my dick as well."<br>
<br>
"It's a bit more than that," she said, an earnest smile slowly replacing her pained one, "It's... Idunno. I guess I was desperate."<br>
<br>
Without words, Will wrapped his arms around his roommate. Her hair was soft and she smelled nice. She was his fictional crush come to life and, bizarrely enough, she even loved him. But it was all too awkward. She was Troy; his roommate, and a man just barely 15 minutes ago. How long was she going to stay as this exotic blue succubus? A day? A week? Just one hour? A dark thought flashed in his mind. What if he could make her stay like this? He shook his head. "I'm sorry for changing like this, for changing your personality."<br>
<br>
"Don't be." Her voice came from near his chest and was slightly muffled, but as it was, he found it to be lovely. She continued. "I was the one who asked for this, right? I wanted to be more flirtatious and open about my feelings. In fact, you gave me everything I wanted."<br>
<br>
He gently grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her away from his chest, his eyes darting over her beautiful face. It was alluring, with equal measures of cuteness and sexiness. Her exotic eyes, her round cheeks, her cute chin, and those soft kissable lips. Soft kissable lips... His own lips were on them before he even noticed. She yelped in surprise, muffled by the kiss, turning into a soft moan. Will could tell she was eager and rewarded her by pushing his tongue past her lips. She passionately returned the favour. Her lips and tongue had a taste he couldn't pinpoint; all he knew was that he couldn't get enough of it.<br>
<br>
How long the kiss lasted, neither of them knew. They eventually managed to pry themselves away from eachother's faces. Troy smiled widely and giggled. "Still want me to go back?"</p>
