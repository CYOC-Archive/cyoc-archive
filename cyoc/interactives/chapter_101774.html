<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Breakfast went well, but as William and Martha made their way out of their home, they had only one thing that was really on their mind. Their youngest son&#39;s fate and future. Melissa Stovall had informed them on the basics for what was going on between Eric and Julie, and they new what was coming, and to a great extent both parents were supportive in the sense that if and when it happened it would be for love and not simply arousal. Their own worries, however, remained on how young both Eric and Julie were and how fast their relationship was developing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think...&quot; Martha began, as she set her purse and a notebook in the back seat, &quot;Do you think it&#39;ll happen today?&quot;<br />
<br />
William sighed and opened the passenger side front car door and quietly climbed into that seat while Martha moved to get into the driver&#39;s seat. When William didn&#39;t answer, she asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it&#39;ll happen today?&quot; Martha asked her voice a bit more insistent, but in a strange way, William could detect hints of pride, joy, nervous fear, and motherly concern all mixed together. In a way, he felt the same way as she did, but both knew that there was little either of them could do to stop things until they were ready for Eric to grow up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given by how much we saw his eyes change color, and often how long they stayed blue before turning back...&quot; William sighed, &quot;It might... though neither of us know enough on weremers to be experts... We know enough about the weres we became through instinctive knowledge... but werecats and werefoxes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t weremers,&quot; Martha sighed in reply, beginning to back out of the driveway once the two were buckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Melissa did say that if they resist it for a long enough period of time... when it happens... their desires will be more instinctive and driven,&quot; William said slowly, &quot;like Salmon going up stream. They won&#39;t be able to control themselves...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric looked in control,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which could mean that if they decide to wait... it might not happen today,&quot; William said slowly.<br />
<br />
William then felt the car slow to a stop at a stop sign while Martha put on the turn signal to head toward the college. He looked to her for a moment, and noticed her eyes narrowed as she glanced to him from the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound a bit saddened by that,&quot; Martha commented somewhat suspiciously.<br />
<br />
William sighed slightly and then nodded, &quot;I suppose I am. I know we&#39;ve both stated to each other that it&#39;d be better that they wait... but suppose they do and it goes until their moment becomes instinctive and they lose control... what kind of moment would that be?&quot;<br />
<br />
While he new his sons didn&#39;t want to repeat his mistakes, they had no full idea on just how much William had wanted to show that he was better than his mistakes. Even before his his transformation, he had sworn to remain loyal to Martha and show that he had truly loved her. And even if it took him years to demonstrate that to Martha, he would have done so. Becoming a werefox had only reinforced that decision, as he knew that he loved her and his fox was more than eager to remind him of all the good things that Martha had brought him in a marriage that was founded on mutual love and even after things was still rather loving. Martha may not have been the first woman William had had sex with, but she was the first in which the act had been one based on love and not simply a date that had gone well. She was the source of all the real good in his life, which included his sons. And that transcended any sex that he had ever had, regardless of who it was with, because of the love he had for Martha.<br />
<br />
It was that that really determined his opinion on the matter. Eric and Julie might be young, but it was as clear as the nose on his face that the two of them truly loved each other, and loved each other dearly. It was beautiful to see and both of them deserved a moment that was a matter of love and not raw instinct. Eric deserved the right to at least make a conscious choice and join were society, not to wait until he and Julie couldn&#39;t fight their urges anymore and they ended up doing the deed  in public or without control over themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be closer to when we... to when I would be ready for it,&quot; Martha answered as she turned toward the college.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it would dear,&quot; William answered, &quot;but think of it this way... it would mean that Eric&#39;s first time would end up being like my needing to be with Yvette in order to complete my transformation. I didn&#39;t want to be with her in any way... but had to be with her because of her clawing me. I still don&#39;t think I&#39;ve fully washed the stink of that motel off of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Julie isn&#39;t like that vixen that clawed you,&quot; Martha pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;True... but if it comes to the point that neither of them can control it...&quot; William answered, &quot;their first time could be a &quot;I need you&quot; moment rather than a &quot;I love you&quot; moment. If it comes now... while they&#39;re in control... it&#39;ll be special and one they can look back on with love and happiness, not with embarrassment or depression over the fact that they didn&#39;t have control over themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha paused for a moment and thought it over as she drove. It did make sense. Her first time had been with a high school crush, though the relationship ended peacefully, real love had never been there. There had also been the instances of experimentation with her bi side before something interrupted her or her parents or her older sister made their commentary that lead to her repressing that side of her. In a way, her time with William had been her first time that was loving and gave her plenty of happy memories. She knew William loved her and she did truly love him. That lead to the conflict over William&#39;s past unfaithfulness.  It had kept her with him in spite of his actions in the hope that things would be better and it also made her wonder why he had let himself be so lead astray. With his bond to her as a werefox, their love had been revitalized. She figured that the two of them could heal and work things over, even if it took a year or two, but William&#39;s bond to her healed everything far faster than either of them could have expected. That revitalized love, to Martha, was part of what made the sex they&#39;d had was werecat and werefox was among the best sex they&#39;d ever had.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose...&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;I suppose that does make sense... that Eric&#39;s first time should be loving...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s still not like we can do anything to make them wait,&quot; William reminded her, &quot;So...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;d be best they do it now, make it loving and happy,&quot; Martha spoke her voice a bit more accepting.<br />
<br />
By now the college was coming into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Melissa said that it would mean marriage for them...&quot; Martha then spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they can wait until they&#39;re at least eighteen to go with the ceremony,&quot; William answered, &quot;and perhaps, if Eric&#39;s scent isn&#39;t a normal&#39;s tonight... we can talk with both Eric and Julie about our wishes for when their wedding takes place...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha glanced to him as she pulled into the parking lot outside the English department at 7:45 AM. She&#39;d have time to make it to the Elementary School, though she wouldn&#39;t have too much time to talk more with each other on the issue. As she parked the car and William climbed out he, he leaned in to finish his comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and then we lift Julie up together, hug her, thank her for EVERYTHING she&#39;s done to help Eric,&quot; William finished, &quot;and then welcome her to the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, William departed to go to get his own classroom ready while Martha departed to head for her day of in-service.</p>
