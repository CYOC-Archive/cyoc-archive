<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something felt wrong. Even though Daniel was enjoying making out with Betty, she had started to feel a bit heavier on top of him. Her already large breasts began to feel even larger. He looked at her in the dim light of the back room, but she seemed the same as she had been earlier, although he felt that she was taller than him now. He distinctly remembered being taller than her earlier. <br />
<br />
&quot;Betty,&quot; he said, hearing his voice crack.<br />
<br />
Betty just kept kissing him. Meanwhile, his shoes fell off, and he felt like he was slipping out of his pants. How had they gotten so loose? he wondered. Soon, he felt as though she were crushing him beneath her. She felt massive, and he had begun to feel very small and weak beneath her. He tried to push her off of him, but she did not budge. She did not even notice him struggling.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the lights turned on in the room.<br />
<br />
Surprised, Betty sat up and looked over at Judy near the light switch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee Betty,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I knew you were a little immature, but I think that one&#39;s a bit young, even for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty looked down at Daniel and gasped. The teen had shrunken down into a young boy beneath her. He barely looked old enough for kindergarten now. Daniel stared up at her in horror. To him, Betty had become a giantess.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what&#39;s going on?&quot; he whimpered and was shocked to hear his squeaky little kid voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judy!&quot; Betty screamed. &quot;You jerk! You total jerk!&quot; She got off of Daniel and marched towards Judy. &quot;Turn him back,&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
Judy just said, &quot;Release,&quot; and blew more air into the balloon.<br />
<br />
Daniel stood up from the couch, and his pants and underwear dropped to the floor at his little feet. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot; he whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figure it out,&quot; Judy said after she had finished inflating the balloon. Then, she looked at Betty and said, &quot;Want me to make something else smaller for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Enraged, Betty growled at Judy and stomped out of the room. Judy just smiled and followed casually behind Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Daniel cried. He tried to follow them, but tripped on his own clothes. He abandoned everything but his oversized T-shirt and ran after the women into the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Betty?&quot; Judy said. &quot;You always complain about feeling small. I thought I would make you feel big for once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven and Amy stopped making out to watch the fight between the two women. Meanwhile, Cathy, who had been half passed out on the chair in the back of the room, opened her eyes a little when she heard Betty shouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turning the guy I&#39;m kissing into a little boy is not helping me!&quot; Betty said. &quot;You were just jealous that he picked me instead of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy chuckled. &quot;Like I could ever be jealous of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel wanted to beg them to turn him back to normal, but he was too intimidated by how tall the women seemed now to say anything.<br />
<br />
Cathy shut off the stereo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel?&quot; Steven said when he saw his much younger friend standing there in only a T-shirt, which covered him down past his knees. &quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty said, &quot;You&#39;re jealous of anyone that has something you don&#39;t have. Why can&#39;t you just let someone else be happy for once without messing with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I don&#39;t need that little boy you were kissing. I can get any boy I want with this balloon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, why did you go after the one with me? Huh? If you can have anyone else, then why pick the one with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
During a tense moment of silence, Daniel noticed his friend Steven sneaking towards the front door. &quot;Steven!?&quot; he cried, when he realized that his friend was ditching him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just going to step outside for a moment,&quot; he said as he reached for the doorknob.<br />
<br />
Judy said, &quot;Control Steven&#39;s age,&quot; and let the air out of the balloon in a rapid FFFFFFOOOOFFFF.<br />
<br />
Steven&#39;s hand missed the doorknob as his height suddenly dropped away. He fell back through puberty into early childhood in only a few seconds, leaving him a tiny preschool boy with bright blond hair. Daniel ran over to his young friend who stood there with his pants and underwear piled at his feet. Steven looked up at the door and then down at himself in stunned silence. Then, he turned to look at Daniel and was horrified to realize that he was even younger now than his kindergarten-aged friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Release,&quot; Judy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck?&quot; Amy said. &quot;That one was mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy started blowing air into the balloon again. Betty reached out to grab it from her, but Judy just turned and walked away. She held the inflated balloon shut between finger and thumb as if she had a weapon in her hand and said, &quot;You stay back. It&#39;s my balloon. You don&#39;t get to touch it. None of you do. Don&#39;t try to grab it again, or... or I&#39;ll use it on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Cathy said. &quot;Let&#39;s all calm down, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet,&quot; Judy said. Then, she glared at the boys by the front door. The boys huddled together, hugging each other in fear. She said, &quot;I think it&#39;s past your bedtimes now. Go home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but...&quot; Steven squeaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now!&quot; she yelled at the boys.<br />
<br />
The boys squealed as Daniel opened the front door and Steven scrambled out of his oversized clothes and shoes. Then, they ran screaming out of the house on their bare feet, not bothering to shut the door behind them in their panic.<br />
<br />
Amy ran to the door to try to help Steven, but the little boy was out of sight by the time she got there. She shut the door and turned to Judy. &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m just trying to have a bit of fun. You&#39;re all being way too serious about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me that balloon,&quot; Amy said, approaching Judy with her hand out.<br />
<br />
Judy looked around and noticed the angry looks on her friends&#39; faces. &quot;You stay back,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I&#39;ll use it. I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the girls stepped closer to each other and paused when they were just about an arm&#39;s length apart. Each of them waited for one of the others to make the first move.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
