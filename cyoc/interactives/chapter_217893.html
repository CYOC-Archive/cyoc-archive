<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;ROBBIE!&quot; Tammy squealed in delight and shot across the pavement as fast as she could and practically jumped into the muscled arms of her towering boyfriend, wrapping her arms around him and latching her lips onto his in a deep, passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
She shivered in delight at how he tasted, feeling his strong arms wrap around her girthy but still short frame as he stumbled backwards into the brick wall of the high school. Tammy had been confused about a lot of things this morning and knew that something had gone terribly wrong with the magic wish stone, but she knew across all of her memories that she had a boyfriend that she loved more than anything else in the world, that her boyfriend was her soul mate and had saved her from being super sad all the time about...something, but that had been so long ago Tammy had forgotten what she had been sad about..<br />
<br />
The tubby, short blonde and the redheaded giant held each other in the embrace until a deafening crack of thunder startled the two of them aprart, Tammy&#39;s eyes snapping open as she shrieked in surprise before collapsing into a fit of giggles as pressed herself against Rob once more. She smiled as she felt something large begin to grow stiff against her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sugarbuns&quot; Rob growled playfully as he ran his large hand through her curly blonde locks, &quot;I was beginning to think the Lame-Mobile had finally broken down. Almost thought about getting the car and coming after you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my big handsome knight on his powerful, um...horse&quot; Tammy said, looking up at Rob&#39;s chisled face. Really it was Tammy&#39;s car, but since she&#39;d been helping Brianna and Gloria she&#39;d just been walking every morning from her own house. Plus the exercise was good for her, even if she often negated the positive benefits with snacking just a little too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can give you something powerful to ride...&quot; Rob growled again as he gave one of Tammy prominent butt cheeks a tight squeeze before lowering towards her round face for another kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew&quot; Gloria said flatly as she and Brianna shuffled further under the awning. Her feet and knees already hurt from the effort of staying upright for so long this morning without support, she was a little wet from the rain, it was too hot and humid (despite it being a little on the cool side of an April morning) and she was still hungry. The cookies hadn&#39;t done anything for her, especially since she&#39;d had to share with Brianna. Plus the scene in front of her just made her feel weird inside. She had no idea what it was but she thought the romantic scene was just gross. Also what if she caught cooties from all of this?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Brianna just fumed in silence as she watched the couple in front of her. She didn&#39;t like Rob at all. He was too big and muscled and she could remember when he would make fun of her, Gloria and Willow when Willow was still in high school. The mean names that he&#39;d call her in the lunch room. And seeing Rob with Tammy, seeing how happy her much more intelligent and prettier friend seemed to be with Rob just made Brianna feel sad that she didn&#39;t have anyone, or that whenever Rob was around Tammy always spent less time with her and Gloria. The corpulent brown haired girl felt like she needed to do something about it, that she COULD do something about it, she just needed find...to find...<br />
<br />
The painfully loud ring of the high school&#39;s bell caused Brianna&#39;s unusually thoughts to scatter into the wind once more. That was the first bell! They had to get all the way through the school to hers and Gloria&#39;s room before the second one or they&#39;d get in trouble! Not that the two girls would have actually been punished, given their...reduced mental faculties in comparison to the rest of the student bod, but Brianna didn&#39;t have the ability to comprehend that. All she knew was that her teacher, Mrs. Orville, would be upset with her and Gloria. And Mrs. Orville was so nice to the two girls that Brianna never wanted to make her upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy, the bell!&quot; Brianna croaked, causing the two lovers to part with Rob giving her an annoyed look while Tammy just stared at her in confusion before the blue eyes lit up.<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG! Yeah, we need to get to class!&quot; Tammy hustled over and opened the double doors that led into the hallway that ran in front of the girl&#39;s gym. She stretched her arms out as far as she could, each door only opening so far and clearly not wide enough for the approaching twin feminine bulks. &quot;Um, Robbie, can you help?&quot; The blonde said over her shoulder, and her boyfriend gave her a weird look before he sighed and stomped over, taking one of the doors out of Tammy&#39;s grip and pulling it open wide as Tammy did the same with her door.<br />
<br />
The ground shook as Gloria and Brianna&#39;s heavy footsteps came closer until they crossed through the threshold and into the school proper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Tammy!&quot; Brianna said cheerfully, meanwhile Gloria simply grunted something as she wiped her perpetually sweaty forehead as the two waddled forward down the hall. Brianna...kind of knew where to go? She wanted to show everyone that she was smart like everyone else while Gloria simply followed her friend on instinct. The former queen of Shermer High didn&#39;t much care where they ended up so long as she eventually got to sit down and eat something.<br />
<br />
&quot;F&#39;sure!&quot; Tammy beamed before letting go of her door and wincing as it slammed shut with a loud CLANG while Rob&#39;s did the same. She darted over as fast as she could and reached upwards for Rob&#39;s neck, the redhead titan bending down and the two sharing a quick kiss as the blonde pulled away to do her daily duty of guiding the two girls to class. Without her they would routinely get lost in the winding corridors of Shermer High, and before Tammy had stepped in to help, Willow had been their daily escort. And she couldn&#39;t let them stop, Brianna would typically keep moving but Gloria would be a pain and a half to get walking again if they stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, I&#39;m gonna help the girls, you should get to, um, class&quot; Tammy said as she hustled behind her charges.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. See you in a little bit.&quot; Rob called after her, watching as Tammy&#39;s gloriously large ass swished and swayed down the hall after her friends. Rob rubbed his face as the trio disappeared around the corner before he turned and began walking the other way towards his first class of the day, which thankfully was a bit of a joke class run by a joke of a teacher: Shop Class, led by Mr.Santini who was retiring at the end of the school year and thus gave zero fucks if students in his class did anything or not. Or even showed up, which suited Rob just fine.<br />
<br />
Rob loved his schedule, and really, loved his life. In the previous reality he&#39;d been beaten by Big Jon Ingerman, the rich kid whose dad more or less owned the town and fancied himself lord of the school. He&#39;d beaten Rob, taken away his gang and made Rob his lackey, eeven ordering him to burn down Bill Strasserman&#39;s house as part of a final trap to get Rob out of the picture entirely and get revenge on Bill for getting him suspended. Rob had been at the Strasserman house, as ordered, but he&#39;d planned on getting Bill to help him, to use the geek&#39;s cleverness that Rob himself had been forced to deal with more than once to take down Ingerman.<br />
<br />
But then the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone had tossed that reality to the wind, and now Rob Bolstrum was living his best life. Due to the damage to the Stone, the magic hadn&#39;t fully twisted Rob&#39;s mind like it had before. Instead he still distinctly remembered Bill Strasserman and Gloria Vanapolous as they had been, Seniors instead of Sophmores and smart instead of retarded. And Tammy...Tammy had been Bill&#39;s little geeky fucktoy and just as smart as him. But now...Now Bill was gone, replaced by Brianna, and Tammy was HIS. His own perfect little fucktoy, big tits, big ass, a sexy thicc bimbo that drooled all over him. Rob didn&#39;t really understand or know how any of it had happened other than a flash of green light that had whisked him away from Bill&#39;s house and dropped him off at school with a complete set of new memories, but he wasn&#39;t going to question it, not with how everything was turning out golden for him.<br />
<br />
And as for Big Jon...Without Bill Strasserman, without the previous version of Tammy Ackerton or bitchy, vindictive Gloria, Rob&#39;s powerbase had never weakened. Big Jon was still around, but the rich bully had chosen to simply pay for Rob&#39;s services rather than take control of the Shermer bullies himself. And Big Jon paid well. Rob (and to a lesser extent, the rest of the bullies) were earning shitloads of cash by being Ingerman&#39;s enforcers. And at this point that basically meant that Rob could do whatever he wanted with little fear of repercussion so long as nothing blew back onto Big Jon.<br />
<br />
Rob wasn&#39;t even living in the trailer court anymore! With the money he was now making Rob had been able to rent an apartment in Old Shermer. It wasn&#39;t the best, but it was his and it was cheap. And it meant that he could get shitfaced drunk as often as he wanted, and more importantly, fuck Tammy on a regular basis without interference from her parents (who tolerated him simply because they loved and spoiled their daughter, and allowed him to eat with them most nights).<br />
<br />
&#39;And who doesn&#39;t love free meals?&#39; Rob thought with a chuckle as he stomped into the Shop room, where the rest of his gang was waiting, including his own right hand man, Jules Harper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boss, you finally get tired of, heh, pounding dough?&quot; Jules snickered, sending a wave of good-natured chuckles through the assembled gang. Before Rob would have been pissed, but now he simply took the ribbing with a wry grin. The boys respected him and in this new reality, liked to give him shit about Tammy being on the heavy side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call your mom and see, shithead!&quot; Rob jeered back, and the entire group erupted into raucous laughter.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah&#39; Rob thought as he oversaw his little kingdom, &#39;It&#39;s good to be the king again&#39;.</p>
