<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, I&#39;d think things went very well,&quot; Peter said to Karen as they began to drive back toward the college campus, &quot;Everyone seemed to like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially your cousins and particularly the younger ones and... Ife,&quot; Karen answered. Her speech slowed a little in the hopes of not mispronouncing Ife&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
Peter nodded as they drove along. It had been a successful day all around. Karen had gotten to meet the rest of his family and they had gotten on very well, though he did expect. There were some weres that had their eyes on being &quot;up&quot; in society as it were, but his family had always been rather down to Earth. The fact that they occupied a rather prominent place in Moon Lake&#39;s society was just something that came about. That gave him the personal confidence that a down to Earth girl like Karen would fit in well and she did. Getting his father and uncles to offer some additional help for security at Jenny&#39;s wedding, which might have been more Karen&#39;s mission than Peter&#39;s, was also successful and would be good for Moon Lake as a whole. Everyone cooperating was the way things should always be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think you and Ife will get along very well,&quot; Peter smiled, &quot;especially since the both of you are such good artists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully my advice regarding this weretiger she has an interest in works out,&quot; Karen thought to herself though also feeling a bit odd about giving romantic advice to anyone. After all, it wasn&#39;t as though she really had much success in that department before she met Peter. She&#39;d do okay at first, but whenever anyone found out about her furry fandom in any way, they left and usually left in a hurry. Though, since she&#39;d met Peter, her own issues were getting better and she honestly hoped to spend many years by his side.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, Peter saw Karen smile to him and he couldn&#39;t help but smile back. He was glad that things had gone well and that they were on their way to their own happy future. The only real &quot;hiccup&quot; there was more the suggestion on going through with the induction ceremony tonight. On some level, it made sense, but it didn&#39;t feel right and both Peter and Karen agreed that their time together and Karen&#39;s transformation into his werelioness should come at the right moment. Not because of either pride rules or because Peter wanted her. He&#39;d had plenty of moments where he&#39;d thought on some activities he&#39;d like to do with Karen and often feeling his libido rise almost immediately, but he had managed to calm himself down. Their first moment would be a magical and romantic one, and he&#39;d even talked with his father on setting that up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Karen finally spoke after a few moments, &quot;she is pretty good. Our styles are different, but she is pretty good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter nodded as he saw Karen&#39;s dorm come into sight on the horizon. He had managed to see some of Ife&#39;s work over the years and Ife had always seemed to do fairly well. He agreed with his aunts that Karen and Ife would get on well and to him that make Karen more than a welcome addition to the pride. He could see that in both Karen&#39;s art and how she carried herself and seemed to be interested in him and not his place in werelion society. They continued driving along feeling confident and things would go well for the both of them. Peter pulled into the parking circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... here we are,&quot; Peter said softly to her, &quot;back at the dorm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Karen said slowly and looked down for a moment. A part of her truly wished to spend more time with Peter, but it was starting to get late and the two of them had already spent the whole day together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Peter asked as he walked around his car to usher Karen into the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Karen looked back to him, her smile returning, &quot;It&#39;s just that I wish I could spend more time with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I with you,&quot; Peter smiled, &quot;You will make a beautiful lioness and a great member of the pride. But our first time should be a more romantic moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And after your roommate&#39;s wedding I&#39;d like to set things up like that,&quot; Peter said to her, &quot;make it romantic and make it loving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to that,&quot; Karen smiled and gripped Peter&#39;s arm, almost hanging on it as they walked into the building, &quot;but if the moment comes up earlier than that... that&#39;d be just as good even if it&#39;s spontaneous.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked quietly through the halls and to the stairs rather than taking the elevator, as that would give the pair more time together. They ascended them and Karen practically found herself cuddling with Peter as they made it to her floor and eventually made their way to her door. After briefly fumbling with her keys, Karen unlocked the door and stepped just inside it. Peter remained in the hallway as she turned him and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for a wonderful day, Peter,&quot; Karen smiled to him, &quot;I enjoyed meeting your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no problem,&quot; Peter answered modestly.<br />
<br />
Karen then leaped up to wrap her arms around Peters neck and looked directly into his eyes. He smiled and hugged her in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while I can wait for whatever you have planned,&quot; Karen said to him, &quot;don&#39;t get too hung up on the plan. The moment should be romantic and should feel right...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it may come sooner,&quot; Peter finished, &quot;I don&#39;t mind that... but the moment SHOULD be right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen nodded and the two enjoyed a loving goodnight kiss. She felt like she was in heaven and a part of her mind happily thought of the future with her and Peter relaxing together in their own home with their own children playing between them.</p>
