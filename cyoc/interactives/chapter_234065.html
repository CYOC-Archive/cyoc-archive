<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now you can at least be imagined to be hot instead of average at best.&quot; Thad commented.<br />
<br />
Jeff ran his fingers over the definition markings representing abs, though he couldn&#39;t feel it, he heard the paint scrape as his fingers brushed over the raised ridges. How could a few hours of work and a couple dollars of materials be re-defining him? He&#39;s a whole person!<br />
<br />
The bulge in his underpants could no longer be ignored, gingerly, he pulled down his briefs to find a girthy longer flaccid drooping phallus, and bulbous testicles made out of clay firmly affixed to his crotch. He tried to remove it but they were superglued to him. He would have preferred Thad use something less likely to break.<br />
<br />
His body was speckled with light brown representing faint body hair, his chest was coated heavier and his face now had a painted on beard which hid his still boyish face shape, lending to the illusion he was supposed to be a man. His arms and legs also had the definition markings implying the was muscular despite his body shape completely lacking the implied tone and definition. Further adornments were a &#39;tattoo&#39; around his arm and something on his back though his mobility as a doll was limited and he could only make out that something was there. Finally, his eye color had been changed from brown to blue, an extraordinary feat considering his size compared to Thad&#39;s. All in all, it worked. <br />
<br />
Despite all this, Jeff&#39;s memories held true, he was still a sophomore, he still went to the local high school, he still wanted to get back home and yell at his mom for toying with him. Jeff reasoned that his doll form allowed altering his physical state with relative ease, but his intrinsic being isn&#39;t so easily changed. A sigh of relief escaped. Jeff smiled with relief and turned to Thad, &quot;It didn&#39;t work, I&#39;m still me. You made me look and sound older but I&#39;m still a teen.&quot; His new voice still somewhat jarring to his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you were a teen that explains why you had such a dumpy build.&quot; Thad looked thoughtfully at Jeff for a long minute before smiling, &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t think so. You&#39;re 23, you just don&#39;t realize it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s look of incredulity didn&#39;t show through on his miniaturized plastic features, &quot;I think I would happen to know who I think I am a little bit better than you! Thank you very mu...&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
Thad grabbed a glass jar from the craft area and set Jeff inside screwing the lid shut, &quot;Sorry Babe, this is just till you realize who you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe!?!? Just who do you think...&quot; Jeff&#39;s cries continued but Thad had already bounded up the basement stairs and his footfalls drowned out Jeff&#39;s complaints.<br />
<br />
Reaching the door, Thad found Julia&#39;s Mom nervously awaiting his reception. &quot;Hello Miss, uh... Hodges. What can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Though she was trying to hide it, her desperation was obvious. &quot;Hi, uh, yes. My daughter, Julia, was given a doll, that was very important to our family yesterday, and she brought it here while babysitting, and said she gave it to your brother&#39;s, but, you see, I need to ask for it back... its very important you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure.&quot; Thad opened the door letting her in. &quot;My family is out right now, I saw my brother&#39;s playing with a doll last night, I saw them rip its leg off. They said Julia gave it to them to do what they want with.&quot; Julia&#39;s mother gasped and looked ill, Thad could barely keep from smiling. &quot;I hadn&#39;t seen the doll today, nor any pieces of it... It looked like a normal doll to me, why is it important to you? It didn&#39;t look that old.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman looked like she was resisting the urge to vomit. &quot;Its my...&quot; she couldn&#39;t say son though truthfully that was what every fiber of her being was screaming. The reality change removed Jeff from everyone&#39;s memory. &quot;... mine, I expected Julia to love it like I did. It&#39;s sentimental to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sweet.&quot; Thad led her into the living room. Careful to remove his grin before looking back at her. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t see it here. Did you want to check the boy&#39;s room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Please!&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman became more desperate as she dove into to bins and scoured every shelf. After a couple minutes of letting her have her way with the room, Thad was growing bored. &quot;Hmm, maybe the boys took it with them on their errands today.&quot; Thad offered, &quot;I can ask about it when they come home. I&#39;ll take your number and let you know what they say. How&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was visibly relieved. &quot;I, um, yes, that would be... something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thad saw an opportunity and took it, &quot;Hey, you look really upset, its just a doll, why is it so important to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She broke down crying unable to restrain her feelings any more. &quot;It&#39;s like one of my children, I just have to get him back!&quot; Saying the truest plausible thing she could.<br />
<br />
Thad stared as she sobbed heavily. &quot;Children? isn&#39;t Julia an only child?&quot; He muttered to himself. Her head snapped up, her face awash with the look of spilling a secret. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll let you know what they say.&quot; Thad, ushered her out the door before she could say any more.<br />
<br />
Thad looked at the clock, 12:33, he gave it 5 minutes, with a grin he picked up his phone and dialed the number Julia&#39;s mom gave him. &quot;Hey, its Thad. I just realized I could call my parents. I spoke with my brother&#39;s and they said they did take the doll with them to Hawthorne Mall but they were completely convinced the thing was alive and going to kill them in their sleep. Ridiculous right? Anyway it was creeping them out, so they dismantled it and threw different pieces into different garbage bins throughout the food court.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her heart wrenching shriek made Thad pull the phone away from his ear and he disconnected the call. His family was actually at the movies watching some stupid PG show. &quot;Mission accomplished.&quot; He said to himself with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Returning downstairs he released Jeff from his jar and chuckled, &quot;Your &#39;Mom&#39; was here looking for you. Not to worry, I told her my brothers ripped you to pieces and threw you into separate trash bins at the mall. She&#39;s probably on her way there now and will spend the rest of the day trying to find you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mom!&quot; Jeff sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;News flash, she&#39;s human, you are plastic. She isn&#39;t your Mom. Human&#39;s don&#39;t give birth to toys.&quot; <br />
Jeff nearly explained everything just to shove how wrong he was in his face. &quot;Just give me back to her. Your plan to change my personality didn&#39;t work, you have no need for me and she wants me. Please just give me back.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I don&#39;t know why you think I&#39;m done, but I&#39;m not. Its time to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thad manipulated Jeff like the doll he was. Jeff was cast in the role of Mark, telling the story of how Mark fell deeply in love with his high school girlfriend but junior year they had a pregnancy scare after their first time. She was so upset by the ordeal she ended the relationship all together. Mark was abandoned and decided to remain alone until high school was over, in this time of self reflection he realized and accepted he was actually bi. <br />
<br />
Once officially an adult, Mark dove into meaningless relationships pursuing the party scene and realized men were easier for him to have purely physical relationships with. Maintaining a job, college, and a social life, coffee quickly became a crutch. Being under 21, house parties gave him access to nicotine, alcohol, weed when inclined, and fresh hookups. <br />
<br />
By the time he turned 21 he was already a smoker and knew how to handle his alcohol, being legal just made access easier. Pushing himself to his limits for three years, he isn&#39;t even awake until his third cup of coffee and second cigarette. His phone was full of potential booty calls and house parties no longer had anything to offer him. His frequent and rambunctious bedroom exertions kept him quite fit. After graduating college with a bachelors in business, he found a well paying job, was living alone, and was slowly becoming open to the idea of a meaningful relationship again. Then Thad self-inserts as the loving boyfriend over the last 3 months, making Mark wonder if he ever even wants to consider women again.<br />
<br />
The sex scenes were drawn out, Thad&#39;s intention that Jeff become as experienced as a porn star was obvious. &quot;So you&#39;re the white knight who&#39;s going to save the broken, broody, self destructive man by teaching him how to love? Tattoos, smoker, let me guess, he has a thing for leather jackets and motorcycles?&quot; <br />
&quot;He does now, and he loves wilderness survival and hunting too. Keep pushing it and you&#39;ll be turned into a hopeless romantic sappy enough to make Hallmark cringe.&quot;<br />
&quot;Such a tired trope.&quot; Jeff complained.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a trope because the feelings that go into it are relatable, IE common. This isn&#39;t meant to be an award winning dramatic romance, its supposed to be Mark&#39;s life and his motivations.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff sighed, &quot;And what then? Let&#39;s say you do destroy my personality, which, by the way, rude, but if I think I&#39;m Mark, this porn star of a business graduate who wants to try monogamy and commitment again. I wake up, 6 inches tall in my boyfriend&#39;s... mason jar... to find I&#39;m plastic and clay? I&#39;d insist you call me out of work, call my family, or friends only to find I never existed. You try to comfort me in crises. I get you off a few times and you practice your pillow talk? What then? The second I think I&#39;m supposed to have a normal human life this whole thing collapses. What are you even thinking? Also, do you really want to spend the rest of your life with a doll as your boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Are you scared it&#39;s working? I&#39;ll just add that you quit your life to become trans-animate, left your apartment, sold your stuff, quit your job. Here we can play it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thad grabbed the piece of cardboard he had used to represent everyone throughout the mock play. &quot;Hey boss, I&#39;ve decided to quit. I&#39;m turning myself into a doll and going to live with my boyfriend.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?! Kids today, so afraid of hard work they&#39;re going off and turning into dolls.&quot;<br />
&quot;Think what you want, but I finally get to just exist and not have to perform to survive. Plus, I&#39;m going to stay young and handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff knew Thad was hoping that making Jeff play the role of Mark would change Jeff into Mark as quickly as changing his physical representation altered his voice.</p>
