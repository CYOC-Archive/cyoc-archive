<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Gloria and the others were looking for people to use the age ring on, not far from them is a mother and son who were at the beach.  Their names are June and Tommy and they represent a single mom with the only child.<br />
<br />
At thirty, June was quite a looker and kept her body in shape to become a magnet to the men.  She’s sporting a pair of large D cup breasts that hang tightly around her dark blue latex bikini that shows some cleavage.  Her stomach was tight and curvy and shows off slight dusting of abs.  Her rear of big and round to help accommodate her curvy hourglass body with a bit of cellulite to form a much more mature fit, getting snuggly over the dark blue swimsuit panties that are beyond the imagination.  Her arms and legs were long and shows some feminine muscle tone after years of yoga and aerobics.  And her face is completely awestrucking with high cheekbones, a petite thin nose, lustful brown eyes, plushy lips, and long flowing sandy brown hair that goes down the middle of her back.  With the exception of small faint lines around her mouth and eyes, she has the body of a supermodel.<br />
<br />
Now Tommy is a typical eight year old, as he was just a small child with a lot of growing up to do.  He was short and pudgy with a gut around the straps of his bright red swimsuit.  His arms and legs were small and showed signs of a late baby weight.  And his face was really chubby with the cheeks sticking out along with a mop of shaggy brown hair.  So he was just an average kid has a bright future ahead of him.<br />
<br />
While they represent the typical mom and son, on the surface, things just doesn’t stick with them.  See, June never had a husband and Tommy didn’t have a father.  The reason why was at twenty one, June was a wild college girl with zero responsibilities and made out with some hot random guy at a frat party after drinking so much.  One year later, Tommy came to her life and she changed so much since she became a mom.  She kept her body fit, she studied hard to get her bachelors degree, and even got a job working for a firm.  All to raise her son and have a better future.  But after all those hardships, she never had a husband to support her and Tommy didn’t have a father to act as a role model.  So she decided to go on dates with some handsome guys just to find her husband.  There is however one problem.  Tommy is a tad bit overprotected.<br />
<br />
He always looked up to his mom since growing up in a world without a father.  So much so that he doesn’t feel like having an adopted dad.  Every time his mother looks at a random guy that she finds appeasing, Tommy gets overprotected and forces a wedge between them.  Not that he can blame himself.  Even at the age of eight, Tommy knew how beautiful his mother is.   If only that his own mom was his age, then maybe they would be together as friends and growing up to be the husband and wife.  But that will never happen as he is going to have to prevent other guys from becoming her husband.<br />
<br />
So that’s where the two at the beach, to have June lounging on the beach chair to find some hot guys to date and become her future husband while Tommy is busy playing in the sand.  She was able to find some cute hunks in her eyes, be that of body builders, surfers, or lifeguards.  But every time she tries to swoo them over, Tommy usually buts in and either annoys them or shew them away by kicking off sands.  June was getting a little frustrated as she said to her son, “Tommy, if you don&#39;t keep your voice down, we&#39;re going back home.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like those men,&quot; pouted Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy, Mommy just wants to make friends.  Don&#39;t you want to have a daddy some day?&quot; asked June.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I want a daddy?  You&#39;re all I ever want,&quot; said Tommy.<br />
<br />
June lifted her head back and gave a deep sigh.  She knows that Tommy never wanted an adopted dad and would protect her, even if she doesn’t like it.  But if she could find someone to flirt with, she needs to keep her son distracted for long enough to find someone that will fit her lifestyles.  Looking around, she spotted a small group of teenage girls hanging out and thought maybe he should get started getting connected with someone opposite of him.  After all, he is going to come of age and needs a head start before he becomes a teenager himself.<br />
<br />
Smirking, she looked to him and said, “You know, Tommy, you should think about finding your certain someone.  As a growing boy, you must be ready for your future as a husband and father yourself.  Besides, do you want your mommy to become a grandma?”<br />
<br />
Tommy looked to her mom and raised an eyebrow, saying, “Mom…  I’m eight-years-old.  I’m too young to find a girl.  Unless you were my age…”<br />
<br />
June couldn’t help but to laugh at the thought of that.  “Oh Tommy.  You got quite an imagination.  I’ll tell you what.  Why don’t you hang out with those girls over there?  Mingle with them and get to know them.  It might help you get ready to find a girlfriend of your own when your older.”<br />
<br />
She soon pointed to the group of girls that she was referring to.  Turning to them, he could see that these girls were slightly older than him.  Most likely teenagers and of different races.<br />
<br />
Seeing them, he turned to his mom and said, “But they are teenagers.  They are a little too old for me to be a friend.”<br />
<br />
June chuckled and said to him, “Well, what better way to start interacting with women than speaking to those that are slightly older.  Now get along.  Mommy needs to have her tan to keep her body in top shape.”<br />
<br />
Tommy gave a deep sigh and knew what it really meant.  I means that while he goes away to talk to these older girls, but for her, she would find some guys without any interruptions.  Considering this is his mom, she won’t take no for an answer and said to her, “Fine…  I’ll go.”<br />
<br />
He soon got up with her bucket and shovel and walked away in a huff.  June waved bye to Tommy and felt relieved that he would be away for a bit.  “Good luck out there, Tommy.  Just stay close so I can see you.”<br />
<br />
She soon got down into her purse and took out her lotion.  Rubbing it on her arms, legs, stomach, and mostly her boobs, she laid back on her beach chair.  “While you do that, I’ll scope out my own boy toys.”  She places her hands over her head and lay there sexily to get the attention of some eye candy.  Putting her expansive Ray Ban sunglasses over her eyes, she lay back on her chair and relaxed, waiting for a hot guy to come and see her.  What she didn’t know is that Tommy was heading straight to a small group of girls with one of them holding a ring of unimaginable power.<br />
<br />
As that was happening, Gloria was searching for a certain target to try her ring on.  But as she was searching, the other girls were getting impatient.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, Glo.  Pick someone already!  There’s plenty of targets for you to use that ring on.” Sasha said in boredom.<br />
<br />
“Pft…  Yeah Glo, stop looking around and use that ring.” Felicia said in annoyance, “It’s not hard to find someone to change.”<br />
<br />
Gloria sighed and told them, “Sorry guys.  I don’t really want to waste your patience.  But I want to make the right choice.  I mean, while the possibilities are endless, I want to make sure if who I choose is the right person that deserves it more.”<br />
<br />
The rest of the girls get why she’s doing it and understood the situation.  To choose the target to change with the ring, she needs to make sure if this target is the right choice.<br />
<br />
Still, they were indeed loosing patience as Diane said, “Well just pick the target you think deserves it and make that wish.  You know I like it when the person regress and progress at a certain age.  It really turns me on in a way.”<br />
<br />
Naomi heard that and gave a deep sigh.  “Honestly Diane, you and your weird fetishes.”<br />
<br />
Diane turned to her friend and said to her, “Oh it’s true!  You know how addicting changing ages is, be that me, you guys, or some random strangers.  Just how detailed the age change is makes you want to masturbate from the sight of it.”<br />
<br />
Gloria rolled her eyes around and told her, “All right, Diane, calm down…  This is a public beach.  You shouldn’t think about masturbating in front of people.  You should wait until you get home for some private pleasuring with your lover.”<br />
<br />
As they were talking, none of them didn’t notice someone coming up to them.  That was until they heard a young boy’s voice near them.<br />
<br />
“Um…  Excuse me…”<br />
<br />
All five girls heard that and turned to the direction of the voice.  That’s when they saw a young boy no older than eight holding his bale bucket and shovel, feeling a little hesitant to speak to them.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, kid?  What do you want?” Sasha said in annoyance.<br />
<br />
Tommy was a little nervous and said with much bravery, “Uh…  Sorry to interrupt…  But is it all right if I…  Join you guys.”<br />
<br />
The girls looked to him and was a little confused by that.<br />
<br />
Diana couldn’t help but to laugh and said, “Seriously?  You want to hang out with us?  How old are you?  Eight?  Why don’t you head down to the kiddy pool with the other kids?”<br />
<br />
Tommy heard that and felt a little defeated, lowering his head and was about to cry.  Gloria saw this and decided to help him out.”<br />
<br />
Getting to him, she places one knee and has her hand on his shoulder, telling him, “Don’t mind my friend.  She tend to get a little salty when she doesn’t get what she wants.  Tell me, what’s your name?”<br />
<br />
The boy looked to her and could tell that she was nice and pleasant, unlike her friend.  So rubbing his arm he introduced himself to her.<br />
<br />
“I’m…  Tommy…”<br />
<br />
Glo gave a chuckle and thought it was a nice name.  “Tommy, huh?  That’s a cute name.” She said to him, “My name is Gloria, but you can call me Glo.”<br />
<br />
She soon introduced the rest of her friends to him and pointed to each one individually.  “And these are my friends.  That’s Sasha…” <br />
<br />
Sasha looked to Tommy and gave a quick gesture.  “Wut Up!”<br />
<br />
“Over there is Felicia.”<br />
<br />
Felicia gave a nod and said, “Hey there!”<br />
<br />
“That’s Naomi.” she pointed to the Asian teen.<br />
<br />
“Kon’nichiwa” she said in her Japanese language.<br />
<br />
She soon turned to the last girl and said to him, “And you just met Diana.”<br />
<br />
The last girl turned away in disgust and wasn’t in the mood to talk.  “Pft…  Whatever…”<br />
<br />
Glo soon looked to Tommy and asked, “So what brings you here to our girls only sware?  You want to build a sandcastle with us?”<br />
<br />
Tommy turned away and wondered if they want to know what’s really going on.<br />
<br />
“Well…” he stuttered, “My mom…  She wants me to hang out with older girls so that way I can be prepared to date them.”<br />
<br />
Gloria tilt her head and was curious about that.  Why would a mom want to let her young son start dating at the age he is?  It doesn’t make any sense to her.  Looking down to him, she asked, “And…  Where is your mom?”<br />
<br />
Tommy soon turned to the direction and pointed right at where she is.  “Right there.”<br />
<br />
Glo looked to where he’s pointing at and saw a 30-year-old woman sunbathing on the lawn chair.  Looking on, she could tell that she was a hot looking woman her age and shows off a lot of sex appeal.  In fact, Diana looked to where Tommy was pointing and couldn’t help but to feel turned on by her.<br />
<br />
“Oooohhh…  Damn!  That’s one hot babe!  I would like to hang out with her than this shrimp.” She said with lustful intent.<br />
<br />
The other girls looked to her and was shocked at her response.<br />
<br />
“Diana!” Felicia said in shock.<br />
<br />
Diana turned to them and said back, “What?  It’s true.  Can’t you blame me for getting the hots on some one hot momma?”<br />
<br />
Glo gave her a bit of a glare before turning back to Tommy.  “That’s your mommy.  She seems like a nice woman.”<br />
<br />
Tommy grunted and told her, “Yeah, she’s nice, but there’s a reason why she wants me away.”<br />
<br />
That got Gloria’s attention and wanted to know about it.  “Oh really?  Why’s that.”<br />
<br />
Tommy looked to her and wondered why she’s interested in his problems.  But considering she is concerned of him, she sighed and told his story.  “When I was born, I never had a father.  Mom told me that she fell in love with someone in college and had me when he left.  So mom wanted to find someone to make a suitable husband for her and a dad for me.  But…  I didn’t want it.  I want mom to myself and having some random stranger as a dad is something I don’t like.  Especially if what she’s picking is some guy with muscles or looks.”<br />
<br />
Hearing what he said, Gloria got two and two together and said, “So you don’t want any guy to be a husband.  You want your mom all too yourself.”<br />
<br />
Tommy looked down and nodded in response.  “Yes…  I tend to annoy any guy she talks to so that way they can leave.  I am a little overprotected on her.”<br />
<br />
Gloria listened to him and gave it some thought.  A young son who is a little jealous on his mom hitting on some guys and wanting one of them to be a husband, doing everything he can to keep her all to himself.  Just the thought of it gives her an idea.  Placing her fingers on her age ring to rub on it, she came up with an idea and said, “Bet you wish to become the husband yourself.”<br />
<br />
She was about to make that wish until Tommy stopped her and said, “No, no, no!  I don’t want to be a husband!  That would be very weird for me.  But if she was my age, she would become my friend, so we can grow up together, go dating, and maybe get married and have kids.  But that’s not going to happen since there’s no way she can be my age.”<br />
<br />
Just as he said that, June stopped herself from making that wish and was really intrigued.  Growing Tommy up to her mom’s age and becoming the husband would be good.  But hearing his side, knowing that he wanted her to be his age and they can start off as friends and grow up together, that sounds so much better.  “And if she was your age, how old?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Tommy finds that question to be strange, but he agreed and said, “Why…  The same age as me.  Eight.”<br />
<br />
Now that she has all the information, she decided to handle the situation.  “Okay, Tommy, why don’t you go hang out with my friends and build a sandcastle.  I’ll be with you shortly.”<br />
<br />
Tommy blinked and wasn’t sure why she talked to him rather strangely.  But giving that she seems trusting, he smiled a little and said, “Okay…”<br />
<br />
Walking to the teen girls, Gloria looked to June on the beach chair and was ready to make a wish.  But before she could do that, she turned to Diana and told her, “Diana, can you do me a favor and keep watching Tommy’s mom?”<br />
<br />
Diana turned to her friend and wondering what she’s up to.  But overhearing what she was talking to the kid about, she began to figure out.  “Oh…” she said, “I know what you’re planning.  You planning to regress that hottie into the son’s age so both he and her can date from scratch.”<br />
<br />
Glo turned to her friend and nodded in agreement.  “Yep.  Since Tommy here doesn’t want to grow up fast, might as well to the opposite and regress the mom and have her date him.  That way he can have her to herself and no other guy would get their hands on her.  I want you to keep watch as she regressed to that age.  Once she’s done, you can escort her to us so she can meet with Tommy and the two will connect.  That is of course if you don’t want to do that and would stay with us building a sandcastle with Tommy.”<br />
<br />
Diana waved her off and said, “Forget it.  Like I’m going to be spending my time babysitting some kid.  Besides, you know how I like to see people aging or regressing.  Has that fetish vibe if you get what I’m saying.  Thought it’s going to be a shame that this woman will loose all of her voluptuous body, at least I know that when she grows up again, she will look that hot.”<br />
<br />
Getting off the lawn chair, she stretched and told her friend, “Well, good luck looking out for that brat.  There’s a Tiki bar close to where that babe is resting.  I’ll go get myself a Mai Tai and enjoy the show.”<br />
<br />
She looked at her strangely and said to her, “Doesn’t that drink have heavy alcohol.  I don’t know if it’s a good idea since teens aren’t allowed to drink.”<br />
<br />
Diana looked at her body and knew that she has a point.  She was just a sixteen-year-old teen with perky BBs, teenage like hips, and a small bubble butt with a two-piece teenage swimsuit.  Looking at herself, she sighed and said, “You’re right…  With a body like this, there’s no way I would get into the bar without proper proof.  However…”  She looked up to Glo and gave a bit of a smirk.<br />
<br />
Gloria knew what she meant and rolled her eyes around, saying, “Fine…  But don’t get wasted, while on look out okay.  Last thing I want is a repeat on the Wedding reception.”  She soon got the ring to her face and closed her eyes, wishing for Diana to age five years.<br />
<br />
As soon as she did that, Diana could feel the tingle and started to age up.  She immediately shot up to a foot.  Her breasts blew up and went between CCs and Ds.  Her hips expand to child bearing proportions with her ass inflating and rounding to match her curves.  Her arms and legs toned up and has feminine like muscles.  Her stomach became flat and smooth with a slight dusting of abs.  Her face heightened with beauty complete with high cheekbones, small thin nose, puffy luscious lips, and small mature eyes.  Her hair grew long and lustrous with a wavy style to it.  And her swimsuit morphed around her to became a provocative bikini with the top part with thin straps round the back and neck and one thin string on the right hip with the rest of the a swimsuit design.  Even her teenage sandals matured as it grew a few inches and altering to create a pair of high heel sandals.  In a matter of moments, Diana went from behind a high school sweetheart to a College knock out.<br />
<br />
Checking her body out, Diana couldn’t help but to smirk.  “Hmm…  Much better…” she said in her more mature and sultry voice, “I can get laid more with a body like this one.”<br />
<br />
Gloria crossed her arms and was getting a little annoyed by her.  “Diana!  Focus!” she demanded, “Keep watch on the mother and don’t get drunk.  Got it?”<br />
<br />
Diana approached her chair and picked up her purse, which was altered with an ID that shows she’s twenty one.  Placing it over her shoulder she chuckled and said, “Please…  You judge me too much.  I’ll keep watch, promise.”<br />
<br />
She soon walked away to the Tiki bar and swayed her hips back and forth to show off some of her own sex appeal.  Looking at her leaving, Gloria placed her hands on her teen like hips and muttered, “That girl has a drinking and sex problem.  I swear, if she screws this up, I will regress her to the point before conception.”<br />
<br />
Turning back, she wondered if Tommy noticed the changes.  Thankfully, he didn’t.  He was too preoccupied with the rest of her friends building a sand castle.  Smiling, she was glad that their cover wasn’t blown.<br />
<br />
“At least Tommy didn’t notice Diana aging.  Otherwise, it would be difficult explaining what has happened.” She thought to herself, “Now, on to business.”<br />
<br />
Looking to the mother still resting on the beach chair and getting a tan, she looked to her ring and gave a sigh.  “Well…  here goes nothing.”<br />
<br />
Closing her eyes, she started making her wish.<br />
<br />
“I have a two wish step I want to try out.  First, I wish that Tommy’s mom over there would regress down to eight.  I want it to be slow and steady so that in fifteen minutes, she would go down to a kid easily without any uneasiness for uncomfortable feeling.  I want her mind to regress her body as well along with her bathing suit.  Plus reality will be altered so that no one will know what has happened to her.  The only awareness that the mother would exist are me, my friends, and Tommy, since he will always remember his mom, even if he doesn’t exist in that reality.  As for the second part of the wish…”<br />
<br />
As she was making her second part of the wish, June was laying back on her beach chair with her arms sticking out and her hands behind her head.  Crossing her legs around, she gave a relative sigh and was glad she finally found some peace and quiet.<br />
<br />
“Finally…” she said in relief, “Piece and quiet at last.  And no son to interfere in my husband hunting.”<br />
<br />
Turning to the side, she could see some potential targets to pick from as she would see some body builders working on and some surfer boys running to catching some waves.  Licking her lips, she was eager to walk down there and grab one guy at random.<br />
<br />
“Got to say, I must’ve hit the jackpot today.  There are a lot of cute guys to choose to be a husband.  And with Tommy out of the picture, I won’t have to worry about him driving them away.”<br />
<br />
Getting her head back looking to the sky, she sighed and understands why Tommy wants to be annoying in front of her potential husbands.<br />
<br />
“Though I can’t blame my son though…  He does tend to get a little overprotected of me since he never had a dad and didn’t want any guy as a replacement.  But for him to say that if I was his age, then maybe we can date?”  She chuckled at the thought and said to herself, “Oh Tommy…  If only you knew what I was like at your age, you’d be surprise how introverted I was…”<br />
<br />
And that part is true.  When June was eight, she wasn’t the over confident beauty she is today.  She was more of a shy and distant shudder girl that never had any friends, let alone a social circle.  The only friends she ever had were that of her mom and dad, who protected her try to get her to go out and interact with others.  Even her looks at eight didn’t make things fair for her.  She was once a skinny child that would make her look anorexic with long curly brown hair that covers her face and heavy dimples and freckles on her face.  So basically she became the human equivalent of the ugly duckling.  But as she started junior high, she was slowly gaining some friends and helped her improve in her life.  Through the knowledge of eating the right foods, a workout regiment, and improving her looks, she slowly started to gain popularity through high school and exploded when she entered college, leaving behind the awkward child behind.  That does of course lead to her getting herself knocked up and made out with a random hottie that created Tommy.  Which set the course of cleaning up her act and getting back on track being a professional woman and a single mother.<br />
<br />
That the one thing she ever wanted to do.  To go back to that thin, weak, scared girl she once was.  She now has a whole life ahead of her, and all she needs to do is find a hot man suitable for a husband and father.  Adjusting her sunglasses, she yawned and said, “Oh well…  What’s in the past is in the past.  It’s the future I need to look forward to.  The future of finding me a husband to love me and a father to help raise Tommy for.”<br />
<br />
Stretching, she decided to catch a few Zs for a while before going back on the hunt.  “Best rest up a little bit before I start my search.  Looking after Tommy can really drain the energy right out of you.  Who knows…  Maybe some random hottie will pass me by and stop to talk.  That is a sure fire away in getting a future family man.”  Yawning one more time, she closed her eyes and started to sleep on the beach chair, letting the sun rays hit her skin and giving her a light tan.<br />
<br />
As she was beginning to rest up, she felt a minor tingle that spread throughout her body, head to toes.  Her initial thought is the suntan lotion she just applied when it cooled her skin.  So she went back to sleep and didn’t pay no mind.  What she didn’t know is that Gloria finished making her wish on the age ring.  So that means that her body, mind, and clothing will regress as the world around her alters to fit her age.  Already, the changes were slowly starting.<br />
<br />
She started ticking down from thirty to twenty-nine years of age as the first signs of aging reversed itself.  The faint lines around her eyes and mouth faded away completely, leaving her skin flawless and smooth.  The extra cellulite that was started to show vanished completely, leaving her body with no sign of any body fat.  Even her hair, which was once faded and having a gray streak or two, regained it’s shine and luster with the bit of gray gone completely.  Despite those worry signs of aging gone, she was still the same as before.  But her mind regressed a year to match that body.  Now June didn’t think of Tommy as an 8-year-old son, but a seven-year-old who is starting to bother guys she was looking for a husband.  But this is just the beginning as she slowly made the downward spiral back to the kid that she once were.<br />
<br />
In mere minutes, June regressed five years of life, making her now a 24-year-old young woman who graduated college and was looking for work in the financial firm.  While not much has changed, there were sings of her body beginning to deteriorate in the regression.  Her breasts went down from Ds to CCs as they begin to decrease on her chest.  Yet they still remain firm and bouncy as she breaths in and out as she sleeps.  Her stomach remained toned and flat, but there were signs of stretch marks beginning to appear around her belly button.  It was evident that she was working hard to get rid of those minor blemishes after giving birth to Tommy.  Now it is back as she was regressing downwards.  Her face and hair remained the same, but there were slight differences.  For example, her high cheekbones that she had flatten, leaving behind the face of a pretty young woman.  But behind her sunglasses, there were black rings at the bottom of her eyes, showing the lack of sleep.  This was because she spent most sleepless nights taking care of Tommy while studying constantly to get her degree.  Those were two things she thought she got rid of, but it’s back thanks to the ring’s influence.<br />
<br />
Her bikini soon started to regress to match her age.  The top part of the bikini starts to spread the fabric on her breasts and around her back while the strings that hold the bikini untie and shrank into it.  An extra strap grew on the right side and went over the shoulder, using it as a support to hold her now blue latex top that still shows off her cleavage.  The bikini bottom did the same as the latex fabric grew from the crotch area and went around the hips, turning into the second half of the swim suit.  Even the sunglasses on her face shifted and morphed into a sleeker more youthful design for her age.<br />
<br />
Even her mind proves it as she thought Tommy is now a two-year-old toddler that likes to whale if he never gets a mother’s care.  It was tough for June as she was trying her hardest being a mother and a college student at the same time.  Even with the help of her mom and dad, it was a tough journey for her and her son.  She hoped that things can calm down, otherwise, it would be difficult to find a job with her baggage.  That will soon change as she kept going down, reaching the threshold of twenty.<br />
<br />
Regressing two more years, she was now twenty-one college student who is legally a drinker.  That led her body to change drastically.  Her boobs went down half a cup side, leaving it to be standard C cups, yet remaining to be round and full.  Her child bearing hips decreased slightly, as it was the time before she had Tommy and the stretch marks were long gone.  Her rear deflates slightly and remains round, but firm.  Even her face youthened and was starting to show signs of her old eight-year-old self.  While the circles on her eyes were gone, slight hints of baby fat appeared on her cheeks, making it look a little puffy but slightly noticeable. And a freckle or two dotted the top of her nose in the middle of her forehead, showing what would’ve been the last of her childhood leaving her.  Even her long her starts to shrink as it goes up her back.  There was even slight signs of waves engraving in her locks.  While it made her look good, it was proof that it was the time her curly styles started to leave her.<br />
<br />
Her swimsuit soon changed drastically as the top and bottom shifted and go for a diagonal design.  The top part went from her right shoulder to underneath her left armpit with the top of her left boob sticking out and going to expose her nipple.  The bottom part goes the opposite end with the top part resting up her upper hip and the bottom part goes down her thigh.  The color of this provocative bikini little to a medium blue hue with a dark blue lining on the ends of it.  Her sunglasses shifted into pair of rimless glasses as her lips had a light red color of lipstick.  Her plain earrings started to expand a little and has a pair of diamond studs on it.  And her finger and toe nails, which had a French manicure on them, lighten in color and looked less red and more lightish red.<br />
<br />
In her mind, major alterations were made.  For one, she doesn’t have a son any more, even though her son was actually with the girls not far from her.  She was just a normal college student with the obsession of partying.  That’s right!  Her wild side returned with a vengeance.  When she turned twenty-one, she was at the legal age of drinking and wanted to get hammered when there’s a party in campus.  She rarely studies since she gets hangovers in the mornings.  In fact, in her mind, there’s this huge party from one of the frat houses that was a boy and girl get together that’s going to be out of this world.  That’s why she’s at the beach.  Not to scope out some guys, but to look good when she comes to the party.  She even was wearing one of those provocative swimsuits that her parents didn’t know to show off how sexy she is, even when she’s in her early twenties.  Course, she didn’t know that the ring kept on regressing her as she left her twenties and re-entering her teens.<br />
<br />
Erasing three years, she was now an 18-year-old high school student that’s about to enter college.  Already, she was reliving her last growth spurt as she started to shrink a half a foot.  It was showing too as her legs were dragging upwards at the lower end of the beach chair.  But that’s not all, puberty was starting to alter her body to look like an older teenager.  Her breasts kept on shrinking until they were BB cups as they were less bouncy and firmer, rising higher as they shrunk.  Her hips compressed and were showing less curves on that hourglass while her rear shrank under on her seat.  The muscle tone on her arms and legs deteriorate and was less college and more high schooler, as she use to been a head cheerleader getting ahead in popularity.  Her face took a drastic change as the skull structure was starting to round with the baby fat slowly increasing on her cheeks. Her nose grew slightly smaller and the freckles on top started to multiply a little bit.  Her lips look less puffy as the lipstick color was now neon pink.  Even her eyes, while closed, was getting bigger as it was loosing their sultry adult look.  The hair on her head keep retracting upwards as the design started to show more slight waves on them.<br />
<br />
The swimsuit started to change again as it left it’s sexy look and have a more teenage field to it.  The diagonal design on her top melted and shifted as it became a regular teenage swim top with both thin straps on her shoulders.  While it covered most of her cleavage, there was a light blue writing on it that says, ‘Teen Queen’ in beautiful cursive handwriting.  The bottom part loose it’s diagonal design and shifted into a bottom part that looked like swimming underwear for teen girls.  Her manicure shifted drastically as it now has pretty designs of unicorns and rainbows.  The reason why is that she has a thing with manicures for teenagers and like to show off.  She really has a teenage thing with her life.  Her earrings she has on grew down and shifted into golden hoops, something cool teenagers wear to show off.  Her sunglasses soon shift again, this time taking the shape of a pair of hearts and has a pink like color on it.<br />
<br />
Her mind soon regressed as she was thinking about leaving high school and enter college.  That would mean more freedom and no more parents breathing behind her back.  She would become her own woman and will live the life she ever wanted.  Too bad that will be short lived as she kept going back further and further into her teens and was entering the most awkward of phases to date.<br />
<br />
Three more years came down and June went back to her freshman phase at fifteen.  She shrunk some more and was under the five foot rank.  The same can be said with her body as it was getting worse.  Her breasts decreased some more and became just perky B cups and has no bounce to it.  Her hips shrank halfway and did have much of an hourglass.  Her butt flatten some more, not giving much of a bubble, but a small hill.  Her muscles weaken as the elbow and knee bones were starting to show in her young teen tone.  Even her face was showing signs of her ugly phase.  Her cheeks were showing more puffiness with her skull rounding even more.  Her nose shrank considerably with the nostrils widening.  Her lips kept getting thinner and her lipstick faced, leaving was would be a minor gloss.  And her eyes, while close, kept getting bigger and more innocent.  The freckles on her forehead continues to multiply and cover the top part and some come down her nose.  But there was something else that happened to her face.  On her once clear skin, a few pimples dotted her face, making her beauty look the exact opposite as what it once was.  She soon felt something in her mouth and felt a little uncomfortable.  She opened her mouth and yawned very lazily.  But doing that, it showed that that her braces started to appear on her once perfectly white teeth that was now slightly crooked and starting to show a light yellow colorization.  Even her shrinking hair showing multiple strands clumping together and showing tiny curls while her sandy color darkened to a near brown color.<br />
<br />
Even her swimsuit was effecting how she looked.  Her top slowly covered up what’s left of her breasts and the bottom hem lowered, making look like a conservative swimsuit top.  The color lightened into a sky blue color with the rhinestones vanished and replaced with a picture of flower with the words under it that says, ‘Blooming Up’  Her lower part grew and extended into a combination of latex boxer briefs and a swimsuit with the came color lightening up.  Her manicured nails shortened and the pictures faded completely, leaving it to be normal polish without the color.  The earrings shrank back and turned into plain earrings that looked badly aligned.  And the hearts shifted back and the sunglasses started to look more worn down, with the lenses having scratches.<br />
<br />
In her now regressed mind, she thinks that she’s with her family on a weekend at the beach.  She hated the beach as she feels little uncomfortable with all these people around her and her looks just won’t make her feel comfortable.  But her mom and dad told her that she needs to socialize with people.  After all, she left junior high and is now entering high school and she needs to be part of a crowd.   And even if she has a few friends back in Junior High, going to a higher education is a whole different story.  Course, what she didn’t know is that she doesn’t have a mom and dad.  At least they are not with her today.  Her family is far from where she lives and doesn’t know what is happening to their daughter.  As for June, she has no idea that her parents aren’t around, just a son that doesn’t exist in her mind.  So when she wakes up and finds that she has no mom or dad, she would get afraid and go in a panic.  What makes it worse is that she or her former son has nowhere to go.<br />
<br />
See, June and Tommy lives miles away from the beach and live in a small condo studio in town.  But as she grew younger, everything changed  When she re-entered her teens, her condo became vacant as furnishings and the like vanished completely.  This left both her and her future son completely homeless with no other place to live.  Now all that’s left was her car as it was parked in the parking lot.  But that soon changed when she left sixteen years of age.  Inside her every changing purse, her driver’s license kept on changing as her face got younger.  The moment she left the appropriate age to drive, her license turned into a learners permit and then crumpled up to nothing.  When that happened, the car she drove started to deteriorate piece by piece.  Like Thanos snapping his fingers, the car deteriorates from the outside, the interior, doors, engine and wheels into dust as it float away into nothingness.  Once June’s car was forever gone a random car saw the spot and parked in its place.  Now the situation got worse as not only June and Tommy doesn’t have a home, but they don’t have a car to drive around.  But that’s not the least of June’s worry as she kept on regressing further and further into the phase she had dreaded for a long time.<br />
<br />
Ticking back down further and further, she regressed all the way to twelve and became nothing more then a gawky preteen girl.  June went through multiple reversal shrunk spurts that was around the four foot mark, having her small and delicate feet sliding to the edge of the beach chair, resting right on it.  The rest of her body wasn’t kind to her as she was living through backwards puberty.  Her breasts continued to melt like two scoops of ice cream as they perky B cups downgraded all the way down to pointy cones poking through her bathing suit.  Her hips pushed on inward and showed little curves with not enough to form an hourglass.  Her rear was flattening completely as there was no more padding on the beach chair she was sleeping in.  Her arms and legs lost most of it’s muscle mass and had very little tone, leaving her with a colt like appearance.  In face, her once flat and smooth stomach how showed the sign of ribs beginning to poke out near the end of her anorexic days.   Her own face was worse for wares as the beauty of an angel was long gone.  In it’s place is a nerdy looking face that comprises of fatting cheeks, small and stout nose, thin lips with no lipstick, bigger closed eyes, and freckles all over her forehead and nose and starting to spread down the sides of her face.  Even her hair wasn’t as luscious as before as it was now a solid brown color and the style was getting shorter and curlier by the second.<br />
<br />
Her bathing suit didn’t do her any favors either as it shifted into something that isn’t as sexy as in her older age.  Both her top and bottom drew closer together as they both merged into a one piece and covers up her skinning frame, even if it still sees her as such, the color lightned into a sky blue and the image of a budding flower and title faded completely.  Instead, there is a My Little Pony logo that appeared on the front with all of the mane six below it.  All of her nail polish faded completely as the shorter fingers had scratches and bite marks on it.  A nasty habit of her biting her nails since she was thirteen.  Even the glasses faded away and she has no protection from the sunrays.  Thankfully, the curls were rearranging on her head, as a bunch of them covered her eyes, so the rays wouldn’t touch her.<br />
<br />
Squirming in her seat, she felt uncomfortable and tossed and turned on the beach chair.  In her regressing mind, she could feel something stirring down below and was feeling a little flustered.  Her parents told her that it was a sign that she is going to start her first period.  Which means that she has to get use to using tampons and checking to see if she’s bleeding.  That’s the last thing that she wants.  After all the years in grade school, getting picked on for her looks, the one thing she dreads is leaking blood in class and the students picking on her more.  Heck, June hated all the students in school.  Always picking on her because of how she looks and how weak she was.  She’s hoping that when she enters Junior High, people won’t pick on her for her ugliness.  What she didn’t know is that she had friend in Junior High and accepted her and helped her be the better woman she was.  But now that she regressed passed that, she was a complete introvert with no friends, only a lot of enemies.  Her situation soon started to get much worse as she kept coming down to her destined age.<br />
<br />
After regressing four more years, June went from being a hot single mom, to a short, skinny, and ugly little girl.  She went through a few shrunk spurts until she was around three feet, almost the same size as her former son.  Once her body can rest on the whole beach chair, now it’s only a small part in the middle.  Not only that, but everything that made her an adult was long gone.  Her cones shrunk into her chest and she was flat as a board.  Her hips and but were flat as well, leaving behind no curves or hourglass.  Just bony hips and sticking out ribs.  Her short arms and legs were like tree sticks as well and had no muscle definition what so ever.  Plus her face has no maturity at all.  She now has chipmunk cheeks on her round face with freckles all over her face.  Her nose was small and wide between her huge innocent eyes.  Her lips were flat as a board and was opening her mouth, wheezing as her lungs felt weak from all the regressing.  That shows off her yellow and crooked teeth with the two front ones missing as her adult teeth won’t grow until her teens.  And to top it all off, her once long and luscious hair shrank up to a boy cut in is nothing but a mop of curls with most of it covered her sleeping eyes.<br />
<br />
Even her bathing suit altered to fit a kid her age as well.  The swim suit she has on was growing down her arms and thighs, stopping close to her elbows and knees.  The light blue color stayed the same, but the MLP stuff faded and replaced with Tiny Toons logo with Buster and Babs Bunny (no relation) on it.  And to top it off, four pair of floaties appeared on her elbows and knees and they looked already inflated.  It’s a known fact that at eight, she was afraid of swimming as her frail body won’t be strong enough to keep her afloat.  This was before she was able to be strong enough to swim and do other athletics.  But at her young age, if the waves were rough, she would easily be cast out to see and won’t survive out there.<br />
<br />
As the changes were done, she squirmed from her beach chair and was groaning from the sun beams.  Slowly, she opened her eyes behind the curls and was a little woozy.<br />
<br />
“Oh…  My eyes…  What happened…?  Where am I?” she said in a young and soft voice.  Looking around, she realized that she was in a beach with a lot of people.  Blinking behind her curls, she was suddenly shocked and said to herself, “Huh!  What am I doing on a beach with all these people?  How did I get here?  Where’s mom and dad?!”<br />
<br />
It was obvious that all of her memories after eight years of age has all been vanished.  No longer was she the confident, sexy, man-eater with a son.  Instead, in its place is a scared, frail, little girl with insecurities.  Putting her bony arms around her bony legs, she started to whimper and didn’t know what to do.<br />
<br />
“Mommy!  Daddy!  Where are you?!” she asked herself, not realizing that her mom and dad weren’t in the beach with her.  Just her son who hasn’t have the slightest of clues what really happened to her.  She drew her bony legs to her flat chest and hugged them with her thin arms, silently crying, wondering where her mom and dad have gone to.  As she was getting scared, a huge shadow towered over her and a soft and beautiful voice ringed out to her.<br />
<br />
“Ah…  Hello sweetie…  Why are you crying?”<br />
<br />
The young June heard that voice and slowly looked up with tears in her eyes.  That’s when she saw a beautiful woman with huge breast, curvy figure, and long and shiny hair, holding a Mai Tai.  What she didn’t know is that this woman is Diana, one of Gloria’s friends.  Apparently, she kept her promise as she was at the Tiki Bar watching the changes in the distance while having her cocktail.  Course the main reason to see this mother regressing down to a child to get her turned on.  Even if she silently masturbated in her bikini, she managed to keep her composure.  Enough for her to walk to her without getting tipsy and talking to her with a drink in hand.<br />
<br />
Jane looked to this woman and said with a sniff, “Sorry…  But mommy told me that I don’t want to talk to strangers.”<br />
<br />
Diana rolled her eyes around and told her, “Me?  I am not a stranger.  Though when you are crying, it would lead to a stranger checking on you.  What the matter?”<br />
<br />
Wiping the rears from her eyes, June told Diana what happened.  “I…  I don’t know.  I just woke up in the middle of the beach and my mom and dad isn’t around.  I don’t know if they are here or just left me.  I’m scared…”<br />
<br />
Diana nodded and knew that Glo’s plan is going smoothly.  Now all she needs to do is take her to them and she would be reintroduce to her former son.  So she brought her hand to the former mother and said, “If you are looking for help, why don’t you come with me.  I have friends that might help you find your mommy and daddy.”<br />
<br />
Looking at the hand, she was a little nervous of taking a hand of a stranger.  “Uh…  I don’t know if I want to be with a stranger.”<br />
<br />
The woman sighed deeply and assured her that she isn’t a stranger.  “Oh, please…  If I were a stranger, why would I help you find your mom and dad in the first place.  Come with me.  There’s nothing to be afraid of.”<br />
<br />
June was getting really hesitant and didn’t know if she could trust her or not.  Especially with the drink in her hand, she knows that people with drinking bad drinks could get trippy.  Still, it she had a calming look in her eyes and could tell she was being honest.  Looking back at her hand, she sighed and accepted it.<br />
<br />
“Okay…”<br />
<br />
She soon grabbed her hand and slowly got off the beach chair.  Picking up the backpack full of stuff, which was once her purse, she and Diana walk to her friends.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Glo and her friends were with Tommy, keeping him busy as his on mom regresses at his age.  As he was building the sandcastle, the others were impressed by how hard he is working.<br />
<br />
“Wow!  Check it out!  I seems like you got quite an artistic style going for you.” Said Sasha in huge interest.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you certainly know how to keep your sand castle steady.” Felicia soon added.<br />
<br />
Patting the bucket with his shovel, Tommy lifted it up and has sand combined with water to keep it stable.  Rubbing the back of the skull with his shovel, he told them, “Ah…  It’s nothing really.  I just want to have fun is all.<br />
<br />
Naomi turned to him and said, “Building sandcastles isn’t a bad thing.  You have the skills for when you grow up.  Who knows…  Maybe you would become and architect one day.  What do you think, Glo?  Should Tommy get a job as an architect when he grows up?”<br />
<br />
Gloria heard her and looked down to Tommy, who has wet piles of sand all stacked up in towers.  In fact, she was trying to make sure Tommy didn’t see his mom getting younger and Diana drinking and masturbating to the show on her lookout.  But seeing Tommy’s work, she shrugged her shoulders and said, “Hmm…  I don’t know.  It’s too soon for him to think of what to do when he grows up.  But, I can be sure that he would have a bright future ahead of him, with a perfect job, perfect life…perfect wife.”<br />
<br />
Tommy heard that and was a little embarrassed at the last part.  Turning away, he felt sheepish and said, “I…  I don’t think I could find a wife.  I’m eight.  I’m to young to find love.”<br />
<br />
Glo heard that and turned her head away.  As she did that, she saw two people coming to them and knew who they were.  With a bit of a smile, she turned to him and told him, “Don’t say that.  You are a nice boy, and someone as nice should have a girl that’s as nice as you.  Who knows, maybe that type of girl will strole on to you and you won’t know it until you meet her face to face.”<br />
<br />
As she said that, they all heard a voice from close by and it was a bit familiar, yet older.<br />
<br />
“Hey girlfriends!”<br />
<br />
Hearing that, they all turned to see Diana standing there, older and holding a cocktail in her hand.  But what caught them the most was who’s next to her.  What they see is a young girl the same age as Tommy who was frail and shy with brown moppy curls covering her eyes.  She turned her head away and was a little uncomfortable around these young women.  Looking to Diana they try to ignore the fact that she was older and asked her about the young girl.<br />
<br />
“Diana…  Who’s that girl?” Sasha started to ask.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…  And why are you drinking with the kid next to you?” was Felicia’s question.<br />
<br />
Diana just shrugged it off and said, “Oh, please…  I’m not drinking that much.  Just small sips.  As for the girl, I found her crying on the beach chair alone while I was walking back.  The poor girl…  She lost her mom and dad and she didn’t know what to do.  So I brought her here to see if we can help her.”<br />
<br />
She soon turned to Glo and gave her a wink, to which Gloria winked back.  The three saw that and knew what their friend did as they turned to Tommy and then looked at each other with concerning looks.  But for Tommy, he didn’t pay no mind of the girls and an older Diana.  Instead, he was too focused on the scared girl and felt some sort of connection with her.  Maybe since June was once his mom, they still have a bond between them.  However, he didn’t know it as this thin scared girl is nothing compared to her hot grown up mom.  Standing up, he approached her and tries to talk to her.<br />
<br />
“Hi.” was what he started with.<br />
<br />
The girl looked to him for a brief moment before turning back with fear in her face.  Tommy saw that and assured her that he might be able to help.<br />
<br />
“Hey, hey!  It’s okay.  I’m here to help you.  I’m Thomas, but everyone calls me Tommy.  What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
She looked back to him and could tell that he was being nice and…  In her head…  He looks really cute.  Again, it’s the family bond between her and Tommy when they were once mother and son.  Now, they are complete strangers who just met.  Brushing her curly hair in front of her face, she looked to him with her innocent eyes and dimple face and introduces herself to him.<br />
<br />
“Hi…Tommy.  I’m…  I’m June…”<br />
<br />
Tommy heard that name and realized it sounded familiar.  “June…” he mumbled to himself.  “Hey!  That’s the same name my mom has.”<br />
<br />
She heard that and slowly starting get comfortable with him.  “R-Really?”<br />
<br />
Tommy nodded and said, “Yeah!  We’re here for a beach trip and-“  When he turned to see his mom, he stopped himself and realized something.  What he saw is that the beach chair him mom was on was vacant as there is no trace of her anywhere.  Seeing that, he got angry and stomped his foot in frustration.<br />
<br />
“Aw, man!  She ditched me!  I should’ve known she would leave me for some random guy she has the hots for.” He said in anger.<br />
<br />
June could see that and turned away a little frightened by his reaction.  He turned to see her a little scared and immediately apologize for that outburst.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, whoa, whoa!  I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to scare you.  It’s just that…  My mom is trying to find a potential husband and it annoys me that she doesn’t care for me and what I want.”<br />
<br />
She calmed down and heard what he said.  Thinking about it, she smiled a little and said, “You’re telling me?  My mom and dad want me to be friends with people my age.  But…  As you can see…  No one would be my friend and tends to bully me for my body.  It’s really embarrassing…”<br />
<br />
Tommy heard that and felt sorry for her.  All her family wanted is to socialize with others, yet is picked on by kids around her age.  But looking at her, she wasn’t that bad.  A little skinny, yes, but not that skinny to be picked on.  To keep her comfortable, he placed his hand on her bony shoulder and said to her, “Well…  You’re not that bad.  I think you’re pretty.  In fact, when you grow up, you could be so beautiful.”<br />
<br />
June turned to her former son and was surprised that he compliment on her looks.  No one ever told her that she’s pretty and this is the first time she heard it.  With a warmer smile, she crushed the curls off her face and said, “Wow…  Tommy…  That’s the first time someone has ever mentioned that to me.  Thanks…”<br />
<br />
Tommy smiled back and said, “Don’t mention it.”  He soon came up with something and said, “Hey!  I got an idea!  Why don’t we both find our families?  I’m sure my mom is close by with some guy she’s hitting on and your mom and dad couldn’t have gone far without you.”  He soon got his hand out to help her in the search.<br />
<br />
June heard that and was starting to get happy.  Not only that she now has a friend, but he also wants to help her find her mom and dad.  Course they both didn’t know was that they were once a family and now Tommy is parentless and June’s mom and dad are far from where they are.  But it didn’t matter as she can now trust him in helping find her parents.  With her confidence building, she looked to her and said, “Kay!” and then grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
Once the two agreed to find their parents, Tommy looked to Glo and told her, “Bye, Gloria.  We’re going to find our families.  Thanks for being so kind to me.”<br />
<br />
Gloria just chuckled a little and said back to him, “Aw, shucks.  I was just helping those in need is all.  Now you to run along now.  And be careful out there.  The beach is like a jungle after all.”<br />
<br />
The two looked to her and said as the same time, “Okay!  Bye!”<br />
<br />
June soon let go of Diana’s hand and the two left the group of girls, looking for their parents.  Once they were gone, Diana too a deep breath and said, “Finally!  Those two are gone.  I thought they were never leave.”  She soon took a long sip at her Mai Tai and sat on her chair.<br />
<br />
Gloria turned to her and said, “Sounds like you were bored at keeping watch.”<br />
<br />
Diana slouched back and said to her, “Well…  Yeah!  It’s been a long day for me and watching that hottie regress into a nottie was torture for my loins.  Still, it was a good show in the end.”  She took another sip and rest up a little.<br />
<br />
Gloria couldn’t help but to chuckle as she can tell that she was annoyed being a watch man.  “Enjoy that drink while you can.  Cause when you’re done and passed out, I’m going to regress you back to a teen.”<br />
<br />
Diana’s only response was a middle finger to her and went back to sipping.<br />
<br />
Glo soon turned to the rest of the girls and realized that they were giving her odd and uncomfortable looks.  Seeing that, she looked at each of them and asked, “What?”<br />
<br />
The three looked at each other as Naomi turned to her and asked, “Okay, Glo…  Spill.  What did you do?”<br />
<br />
Gloria knew where this was going and answered honestly, “Me?  Why, I just used my ring to help someone in need.”<br />
<br />
That’s when Sasha told her what really happened.  “Really?  You just regressed that mother into her son’s age and made her forget everything after eight.”<br />
<br />
Gloria sighed and said to them, “Okay…  Yes…  Maybe I did that.  But can you blame me?  The kid was getting jealous of his mom hitting on every guy she comes across.  It was obvious that he want her all to himself.  Why not regress her to his age so they can start an actual relationship?”<br />
<br />
The girls looked on and wondered if she hasn’t thought in advance.  So Felicia told her of that situation.  “You do realize that Tommy doesn’t have a mother anymore.  Not to that you don’t know if that said mother has an actual family or not.  If they can’t find what they are looking for, they could be regarded as homeless orphans with no place to go.”<br />
<br />
Glo waved it off and told them, “Relax, I already got that covered.  See I did a two part wish to help them both.  The first is of course regressing the mother to his son’s age physically and mentally as a way for the two to be together naturally.”<br />
<br />
“And what’s the second part.” Naomi asked out of curiosity.<br />
<br />
Gloria chuckled and told them, “That, my friends are a need to know basis.  What you should know is that by the end of the day, they will be happy together as a lovely couple.”<br />
<br />
Diana chuckled and told them, “Girls, girls…  What’s with the sudden change of pace?  We’re on vacation!  Live a little.  Besides, Glo here knows what she’s doing.  Trust in her.”<br />
<br />
Gloria shrugged and said, “Don’t worry about what happens to the two, they will have their happily ever after when the day’s over.  For now, let’s just relax and enjoy our time here.”<br />
<br />
The two soon rest on their chairs and enjoy their day at the beach.  The three girls though looked at each other and were a little worried about that.<br />
<br />
“Something tells me that this is going to be a long day.” Felicia said with concern.<br />
<br />
“You and me both, Sista.” Sasha mentioned, “You and me both.”<br />
<br />
The group soon lay on their chairs and enjoy the rest of their day at the beach.</p>
