<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Layla thought about what to change Jeff into, she remembered that their dinning room table was down one chair, as it had broken about a week ago and she had not had the time to get it fixed. &quot;Perfect!&quot; Layla thought with a smile as she clicked through the options to change Jeff into a chair for the weekend.<br />
<br />
She set the duration of the change for 2 days. She also set the kind of chair she wanted - a dinning room chair with dark wooden legs and back, and a cushioned seat. There were more options she hadn&#39;t thought about before. She didn&#39;t want Jeff to just poof into a chair, so she set the duration of the transformation to 3 minutes. She set aware to &quot;on&quot; so Jeff would know what was happening and made sure he would continue to be aware after he was just a chair. She also saw another option for making the transformation pleasurable. &quot;why not?&quot; she thought as she clicked &#39;yes&#39;. With everything set she hit the &#39;apply changes&#39; button and twirled around to watch the change.<br />
<br />
Jeff hadn&#39;t seen what his mother had done, but as she turned around with a smile on her face, he knew that she had finished inputting whatever he was going to be for the weekend. &quot;So, what is it?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see, I want it to be a surprise!&quot; Layla said, anxiously awaiting the changes.<br />
<br />
Jeff was ready to answer when he was suddenly overcome with a strange urge to remove his clothes. He began pulling his shirt over his head and tossing it aside as he then bent over to remove his shoes and socks. &quot;Sorry Mom. I can&#39;t help it, it&#39;s making me do this!&quot; He blushed as he removed his pants and kicked them off. He didn&#39;t want to strip like this in front of his Mom. She hadn&#39;t seen him fully naked in many years. But he couldn&#39;t fight whatever power the Chronivac had to influence his actions, and he yanked off his boxers. His penis and balls flopped free as now stood butt naked in front of Layla.<br />
<br />
Layla was a bit surprised by this turn of events. &quot;Sorry Jeffy. I didn&#39;t know it would do that. Don&#39;t worry, there is nothing to be ashamed of about your body!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff knew his mother was trying to put him more at ease but he only felt more embarrassed by her words. He wanted to cover himself but he couldn&#39;t control his hands. It was like his body wasn&#39;t responding to his own brain anymore.<br />
<br />
Jeff then bent his knees and sat backwards as if he was sitting in an invisible chair behind him. It felt awkward to Jeff to be in this position. Then, he felt a strange sensation on his butt. Two appendages grew outward from his butt cheeks towards the floor until they made contact. Suddenly, Jeff found himself balanced now on four legs, his original legs, and his &quot;new&quot; legs that grew from his butt. He looked down to see that his feet were reshaping into the ends of darkened wooden chair legs. His skin on his legs was also beginning to turn to dark wood as it slowly traveled upwards from his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, a chair!&quot; Jeff said, realizing what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
Layla was amazed at the transformation overtaking her son. She also couldn&#39;t help but notice that the transformation must have been turning him on as his 7 inch dick was now standing erect outward from his body. Perhaps the effects of the pleasurable setting, she thought. <br />
<br />
Jeff could feel his thighs shift and break into four sections that formed the frame of the chair seat, also darkening into wood. The changes were strange, but did feel good. He realized with some additional embarrassment that the changes were giving him an erection that he could do nothing about hiding. Just then, his penis began to grow even larger. The head of his penis began to flare outwards and flatten out as it kept puffing up more and more until it filled the seat frame. Jeff couldn&#39;t help himself from moaning at the feeling as his cock head reshaped into the cushioned seat of the chair. God, it felt so good!<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s torso began to split apart into different wooden sections to make up the back of the chair. He also felt his head begin to shift downwards as it reshaped into intricate wooden designs at the top of the chair back. Amazingly, he could still hear and see, though he wasn&#39;t sure how. His vision came from the top of the chair and he could still Layla sitting there with her mouth open in surprise.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac dinged as Jeff&#39;s changes finished. He was a chair! He couldn&#39;t move an inch or speak, but he realized that he could still &quot;feel&quot; the air around him. He also really wanted someone to sit on him. Like really, really wanted someone to sit on him. His seat cushion felt as if his cock was fully erect and begging to be touched in order to experience some release.<br />
<br />
Layla giggled a bit as she looked at what Jeff had become. &quot;Oh, what to do with you now?&quot; She said out loud as she approached Jeff the chair.</p>
