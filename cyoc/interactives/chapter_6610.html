<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was just about ready to leave the locker room when suddenly the door flung open.  Trisha came bounding in, an anxious look on her face.  &quot;Oh, thank God I found you,&quot; she said.  She came right up to me and started to kiss me right away.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, I was finally able to push her away.  I held her back away from me and asked, &quot;Just what the hell are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm kissing you,&quot; she said, as if it was something she normally did.  &quot;Do you have a problem with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, I do, actually,&quot; I said, beginning my ruse.  &quot;I have a big problem being kissed by someone who calls my best friend a 'fag.'&quot;<br />
<br />
A puzzled look appeared on her face.  Then she recoiled in shock.  She knew that I meant Brad when I said 'my best friend.'  &quot;I...only said that...&quot; she was staring at me in absolute shock, unable to finish her sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;...on Friday night at Erika's house?&quot; I finished her sentence for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.  &quot;How do you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know everything that happened on Friday,&quot; I smiled wickedly.  &quot;I was there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how?  Th-there's n-no way.&quot;  She sounded really worried.  That only made me more satisfied.  I was going to enjoy watching her sweat for a few minutes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but there is,&quot; I corrected her.  &quot;With this,&quot; I said, showing her the ring.  &quot;This ring gives me the power to grant any wish of mine.  So, I made myself invisible and spent the night watching you and your friends belittling me and my friends.&quot;  She looked like she was going to wet herself.  So, to be on the safe side, I wished she wouldn't no matter what I might say to her.  And just so I didn't have to hear her question what I had said, I wished I would become invisible again.  She gasped in complete shock, as she saw my clothes, but not me.  I became visible again and said, &quot;Now you see me,&quot; wished to be invisible and finished, &quot;now you don't.&quot;  I reappeared again.<br />
<br />
Trisha found herself unable to speak.  So I kept giving her the exposition.  &quot;Now, you probably feel an unexplained and uncontrollable desire for me, don't you?&quot; I asked.  She was able to slightly nod her head.  &quot;Well, I wished for that to happen, too.  To all of your friends, actually.  Soon I'll have you all wrapped around my finger, begging me to please you all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; she finally spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?!&quot; I said angrily.  &quot;Why not?  Your little group of friends do everything to hurt other people with words.  I'm giving it back to all of you ten times over.  Maybe you'll all finally learn a lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Joe,&quot; she pleaded.  &quot;I've never said anything bad about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know that for sure,&quot; I said.  &quot;And even though I could probably force you to tell me the truth, it wouldn't change anything.  But, you didn't say anything about me on Friday.  So you're getting off easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Define 'easy,'&quot; she said.  Suddenly her clothes vanished.  Her gorgeous frame was exposed for all to see.  I quickly made the same wishes as with Lindsey to insure that her being naked would be normal and unharmful.  &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked, trying to cover herself as best she could.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You might as well not do that,&quot; I said.  &quot;I've already seen you naked anyway.  Besides, you'll never wear clothes again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of your desire for me,&quot; I said.  I wished my own clothes to disappear as I walked towards her.  &quot;I'm going to make it so that I'll be able to please you whenever you need it.  Wearing nothing will make it that much easier.&quot;  She had backed up against a wall.  She was still a little afraid of me.  I wished she would feel at ease.  Instantly I could see her relax.  &quot;You can kiss me again now,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
She sprang onto me.  I caught her in my arms as she assaulted my lips with hers.  I thought this would be an interesting way to do it.  She wrapped her legs around me tightly.  I wished that even if I let go of her, she would still be able to hold onto me.  First, I slid her into the proper position.  My very erect cock slipped into her already wet pussy.  She began to moan loudly, and again I wished that no one would be able to hear us.  <br />
<br />
I let go of her legs, and just as I had wished, she maintained her hold on me.  I removed her arms from around my neck and began to bend her down.  While still engaged with her, she furiously pumping up and down my cock, I bent her upper body down.  I began to massage, lick, and suck her breasts.  It was probably an extremely weird sight to see.  She was holding on to me by only her legs wrapped tightly around my ass, and her pussy being engaged with my cock.  I could feel myself about to come and I exploded into her harder than I had with Lindsey.  She climaxed just as I shot my load into her.<br />
<br />
I held onto her upper body again as she placed her legs back down on the ground and slipped of my cock, some fluids dribbling to the floor.  I wished that there would be no mess on either of us or on the floor.  The small amount of fluid disappeared.  <br />
<br />
She studied my face for a moment and then asked, &quot;So how is being naked supposed to help my urge to fuck you?&quot;  She was concerned that I wouldn't be able to help her as I had said.  But I made the necessary wishes while she was looking at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're in all of the same classes,&quot; I said.  &quot;So I just wished that you and me would sit together everywhere, even in the same chair if we wanted to.  More importantly I wished that we could have sex anytime, anywhere and no one would notice it, or care about it, or think anything was wrong with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She absorbed what I said.  Then she asked, &quot;So we can fuck each other in the middle of class?&quot;  She seemed turned on by the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any time at all,&quot; I said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Kinky,&quot; she smiled.  &quot;I love that idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sure you will,&quot; I said.  I wished that my clothes would reappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;This,&quot; she said, pointing up and down her body, &quot;is going to take some getting used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be fine with it,&quot; I assured her.  &quot;Lindsey seemed to like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't you see her on your way in here?&quot; I asked.  She nodded.  &quot;Didn't you notice something strange about her appearance?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no,&quot; Trisha said, &quot;other than the fact that she was smiling for the first time alll day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was naked, Trisha,&quot; I said in a tone that reflected she should have noticed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; she said, shrugging her shoulders.  &quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I remembered I had wished for everyone to think Lindsey being naked was normal.  Hmm, I thought.  I didn't even say everyone but me when I made that wish.  Did the ring somehow know that I wanted to think it was abnormal?<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I said.  &quot;You think it's normal because I wished it like that.  I'll have to fix that later.  Oh, well.  For now, let's go back to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took her hand but before I could walk out of the door, she pulled me close and kissed me on the lips.  &quot;Thank you for being so nice to me,&quot; she said.  I was surprised that she considered what I had done to be nice.  But she was a little smarter than the others.  Maybe she knew they were in for a worse fate.  Besides, she was going to be right by me all the time, getting pleasured whenever she needed it.  We left the locker room and the day continued.</p>
