<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He turned his slowly head to see a shy looking young girl. She looked like she belonged in middle school. Steve guessed she was around 14, even though she was quite a bit shorter than your average 7th grader. She wore an oversized sweatshirt and wide pajama pants, her tiny bare feet barely sticking out of their hem. It was really hard to make out anything about her shape, because of the size of the sweatshirt and the fact that she slouched, so Steve&#39;s brain had so stick with just &#39;short&#39;. Other than that she had a pretty uncharacteristic face with a head of straight mousy hair hanging down to her elbows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who.. who are you, kid?&quot; asked Steve even though he knew that soon the answer to that question will probably change. As if sensing his concern, the girls expression changed from that of a shock to that of pure joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now? Fucking Amy Richards. But soon? **YOU!**&quot; she seemed euphoric and, frankly, kinda mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t a young lady like you be using a little more polite language, huh?&quot; Steve knew he probably sounded like his own grandfather but he didn&#39;t really know what else to say in this situation. His brain was frozen.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is exactly the kind of shit people say which makes me HATE being a girl&quot; she stomped and raised her voice. &quot;I HATE my school telling me what my uniform should be! I HATE everybody telling me how wrong it is for me to like girls! I HATE how everyone treats me like I don&#39;t understand anything just because I&#39;m 4&#39;9&#39;&#39; and don&#39;t have a penis! And I so, SO MUCH HATE how these still keep growing even though they are already so fucking uncomfortable!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephen was confused what &#39;these&#39; exactly she referred to until he noticed she was pointing at her chest. He understood why the baggy sweatshirt - she must have been embarrassed of her breasts. Now that he thought about it, he could make out certain tension in the shirt around her chest, although it wasn&#39;t very pronounced because of the girl&#39;s slouch. She, meanwhile continued her rant. &quot;They are just those ridiculous, sore pieces of heavy fat stuck to my chest, and for what? For the amusement of men? For pervs so much older than me to ogle me? No. I&#39;ll NOT have that. I&#39;ll rather have YOUR life...&quot;<br />
<br />
This was all just too much for Steve. He stood up and turned to his unexpected visitor to throw her out of the room but he stopped in his tracks when he noticed something weird happening to Amy. She seemed to be... growing!<br />
<br />
The bottoms of her pants, instead of almost completely enveloping her tiny feet like just seconds ago, now hung ever so slightly above her ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit... I can feel it!&quot; her voice was already starting to sound different. It was breaking!<br />
<br />
Steve looked at her face as it slowly changed shape. No longer oval, her jaw started covering with small patches of facial hair, all the while her brown hair lightened up to dirty blonde and shrunk back into her scalp. She kept her eyes closed, an expression of contentment on her face. The most striking change was definitely her height as every couple seconds she seemed to gain another inch after inch. Her baggy sweatshirt also seemed to start fill up with her torso resembling more and more the much larger, male specimen. She must have also noticed that because her eyes shot open and her started doing something with her arms behind her back. Steve watched a look of relief enter her... now HIS face. The face he know very well from looking into the mirror now stared back at him, refusing to mirror his shock and instead grinning widely.<br />
<br />
All it took was a little under a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;This. Is. JUST. GREAT!&quot; The new Steve in front of him shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I can&#39;t believe what just happened...&quot; the original Steve covered his face in his hands. He had to sit down, this was all too much.<br />
<br />
He looked back at Amy the impostor who by now managed to take off her sweatshirt. The sight was ridiculous - it was his own, almost six foot body, wearing nothing but pajama pants meant for a girl 15 inches shorter than him and a plain black bra, already undone at the back. The straps of the bra were short and tiny, making the empty cups ride high on his doppelganger&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Amy took the bra off and tossed it to Steve. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here! Don&#39;t loose it!&quot; She said as Steve caught the contraption awkwardly. &quot;It&#39;s 26E although I should have probably upgraded it to F a couple weeks ago. Not easy to find any reasonable cup size with such small band measure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaaat?.. Band measure? Upgrade? Why are you telling me this?&quot; Steve could not quite process, or maybe he didn&#39;t want to, what all of this meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Steve, you can read up about this later. Plenty information online. You&#39;ll find some good resources bookmarked on my laptop at home.&quot; She continued. It was so disconcerting to Steve to hear his own voice coming from another person.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, but... Why are you telling me this?&quot; Steve asked in vain as it wasn&#39;t given to him to hear Amy respond. Suddenly he felt nauseous and had to close his eyes. When he opened them a second later he was in an unfamiliar room, in an unfamiliar house, sitting on unfamiliar bed.<br />
<br />
And that was clearly the least of his worries...</p>
