<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I finish with the last of the articles of clothing I notice that <br />
the shoes seem to fit someone with a much larger foot than mine both <br />
in length and width but mostly width.<br />
<br />
The tool belt has a definite arc to the top of the top of the belt. <br />
The belt seems to ride on my hips totally from the bottom ridge of the <br />
belt.<br />
<br />
The shirt seems to have been well worn. Not only are there holes in in <br />
but it is stretched out of shape. This could be because of many <br />
washings but it doesn't seem to be the case.<br />
<br />
I come out and take a look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Ok not really the look I was going for but it will do.<br />
<br />
I head back in and undress and take my finds up to the register and <br />
check out.<br />
<br />
When I get home I call for Shawn. Hey I got costumes for us.<br />
<br />
Go try yours on I think it will look good on you. I am going to go put <br />
mine on and show you how I look.<br />
<br />
When Shawn comes out he is in a tight fitting shirt that seems to be <br />
cutting him off at the waist. Showing his pecs very definitively. His <br />
cut off Khaki's and a nice tool belt that rides on his hips.<br />
<br />
I walk out in my ill fitting outfit and we take a look at each other <br />
and laugh. This will be fun.<br />
<br />
They head out to the party and get all sorts of comments on their <br />
costumes as they wander around.<br />
<br />
That is your 5th beer in the last half hour Shawn says to me. Aw leave <br />
me alone you know I like my beer.<br />
<br />
But you know how you get.<br />
<br />
Damn ball and chain Ba Bang! I think I'll Keep Her. I say to Brian the <br />
guy I was talking to when he Shawn came up to comment on my drinking. <br />
Damn Shawn was looking good. Was it the alcohol or was he looking real <br />
good in that outfit.<br />
<br />
I found my way back to the kitchen and sat my ass down next to the keg <br />
chatting with the guys that wandered by drinking beer after beer and <br />
helping swap out the kegs as they were emptied. I think I drank more <br />
than I had ever had before in my life and I had to pee from time to <br />
time. One particular time the bathroom was so full I walked out the <br />
back balcony and whipped out my dick and started showering the yard <br />
below.<br />
<br />
Shawn came up behind me and pressed me against the railing and there <br />
he was with that damn fruity cocktail that he liked so much.<br />
<br />
Have you had enough yet? Shawn asked.<br />
<br />
Naw I am just getting started.<br />
<br />
I sat my ass down on the stool next to the keg and started at it <br />
again.<br />
<br />
Please don't drink too much Shawn pleaded with me in a way I don't <br />
remember him ever doing before but seemed so familiar.<br />
<br />
Ok I will try.<br />
<br />
Shawn leaned down and gave me a peck on the cheek that seemed both <br />
strange and familiar at the same time.<br />
<br />
As the night wore on I found myself migrating to the living room and I <br />
flopped on the sofa eventually passing out from the alcohol but not <br />
before Shawn found me sitting so close that I wrapped my arm around <br />
him and pulled him close.<br />
<br />
When I woke the next morning he was still wrapped in my grasp and I <br />
looked at him with a pounding head thinking he fit that costume so <br />
damn well.<br />
<br />
Gotta go pee I mumbled to no one in particular.<br />
<br />
Okey dokey honey. Was that a slight lisp from Shawn?<br />
<br />
I found my way to the bathroom, eyes half closed the whole way and <br />
found my dick and peed for what seemed like half an hour. When I <br />
finished I went to the sink to rinse my mouth out and splash some <br />
water in my face. When my vision clears I see myself. Big beer belly. <br />
Now the stretch in the top part of the tool belt makes sense. The <br />
shirt rides up exposing a nice hemisphere of belly accentuated by a <br />
deep innie belly button. My pecs looked like pillows on top of by new <br />
found belly.  My pants were tight stretched out into tree trunk legs <br />
that seemed stuck into the boots that just yesterday seemed to be so <br />
loose. My hair was black and curly and I had a full beard. And as I <br />
took off the hard hat I found a definite bald patch in the center from <br />
the wear of the hat.<br />
<br />
This all seemed somehow wrong but I couldn't figure out how.<br />
<br />
I wandered out to find Shawn and picked him up like a rag doll and <br />
threw him over my shoulder. Wa? Was all he could say.<br />
<br />
His tiny little waist made his big bubble butt wander into my face but <br />
he was no trouble at all to haul out to the car and toss into the <br />
passenger seat.<br />
<br />
I got in and had to push back the seat all the way and I headed home. <br />
I looked over to Shawn and noticed that his six pack abs were <br />
particularly defined and his pegs seemed to have swollen out so deep <br />
that they were almost as big round as my beer belly over what looked <br />
like a 27 inch waist. His blond curly hair and not a hint of a beard <br />
made him look like he was 18 but I knew he was much older than that.<br />
<br />
As I made my way to home I found myself turning into McDonald's for a <br />
quick breakfast meal. Coming out with a grocery bag full of goodies. <br />
The reflection in the window seemed to show the wrinkles in my face <br />
and I would have to guess I looked like I was in my mid to late forties.<br />
<br />
When we got home I found that Shawn no longer had a room of his own we <br />
just went into my room and flopped him down on the bed where I <br />
finished up the bag of McD's as a man in love with his food would do. <br />
Making short work of it.<br />
<br />
My big belly seemed to fit so well into Shawn's curve. His butt <br />
fitting nicely under my belly as I moved closer to him and spooned <br />
with him as we both went back to sleep.</p>
