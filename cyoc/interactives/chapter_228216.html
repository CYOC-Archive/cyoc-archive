<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelly was fighting not to starch with all her willpower, she had to stay human, she had to find a way to get home. She had a life back home, she had everything else and most importantly, she hated the water. <br />
<br />
She hadn’t told anyone, not even the love of her life Carmen who was standing beside her but she was nearly deathly afraid of open deep water, just like the ocean. Going to the pool or being near the beach was ok, but open deep water was out of the question. So becoming a mermaid while a dream come true for some, like her roommate Jenn who now rested in the sand as a beautiful mermaid it was a horror for her.<br />
<br />
“You’re afraid.” said Theodora as she looked at Kelly.<br />
<br />
“Of course, I am afraid, I was kidnapped and…” started Kelly <br />
<br />
“No, it is something more then that.” Stated Theodora “Please do not lie to me, I have been trained to help you all with this change and I have seen many people come through over my time.”<br />
<br />
“Kelly…what is wrong?” inquired Carmen showing the deep concern as she came closer and took Kelly’s hands within her own. “You can tell me anything.”<br />
<br />
Kelly looked up at Carmen, Carmen was tall for a women while Kelly was slightly on the shorter side, so Kelly had always had to go up to kiss her girlfriend. Kelly looked into those eyes full of concern yet care and found she had to give in. <br />
<br />
“Fine…” said Kelly giving up. “You know my parents own a sail boat right?”<br />
<br />
“Well, we have been on a it a few times, we even did it on top on top of it one time as an F you to those bigots.” Stated Carmen, as she remembered the sailboat her girlfriend’s parents owned. “What of it?”<br />
<br />
“Well, when I was six or seven, I was out sailing with my dad and he flipped the boat in by accident.” Stated Kelly, her voice weak. “While I was wearing a life vest, my foot got stuck in a line and I almost drowned…ever since then…”<br />
<br />
“You have been afraid of the water.” finished Carmen as Kelly nodded. <br />
<br />
“I can handle pools, even standing in the ocean but open…deep…water…” said Kelly her voice shaking a bit.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I will be right beside you.” answered Carmen pulling her girlfriend into a tight hug. <br />
<br />
“Also a lot of this world is shallow water with lots of coral reefs and sand dunes to rest on.” Stated Theodora “We will take it slow and help you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Kelly as she cried into her girlfriend’s chest. As she did, she couldn’t help but starch one spot on her leg. It was a short and gentle starch but it was more than enough.<br />
<br />
Part of her skin feel away as a patch of scales, maybe 2x4 inches square came off.<br />
<br />
Theodora moved her hand as water moved up to remove the blood. Once cleaned the sun glinted off a rather beautiful set of metallic bronze or copper scales which now graced Kelly’s legs. It’s color went very well with her light brown hair. <br />
<br />
“I guess there is no stopping this.” said Kelly somewhat resigned as she looked at her leg.<br />
<br />
“No, the transformation should happen in an order based on how much time you where around the painting.” Stated Theodora <br />
<br />
“I owned it and had it over my bed, so I guess that is why I went first.” Stated Jenn as Theodora nodded.<br />
<br />
“I am her roommate, so I guess I am second.” Kelly started pulling her eyes away from the scales on her legs.<br />
<br />
“We both started dating them around the same time.” Answered Olivia as she looked at Carmen and then at Theodora “So I guess either one of us could be up next.”<br />
<br />
“Or both.” stated Theodora “Was anyone else around the paintings a lot?”<br />
<br />
All four women eyes widened for a moment before the sound of coughing filled the air. <br />
<br />
All four turned to see two more figures lying on the sand. <br />
<br />
One was a rather muscular African American man, his skin a pitch black and his long hair in tight braids while the other was thinner white guy with short black hair. He was not nearly as built as the other guy with the body of a runner while the other was more of the body builder type.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…Jamar.” said Carmen<br />
<br />
“Tim.” proclaimed Kelly as both men pulled themselves on shore a few yards away before flipping over on their backs looking up at the sky. Both women rushed over to each of them.<br />
<br />
“Who are they?” inquired Theodora confused.<br />
<br />
“Both Carmen’s and Kelly’s parents are very homophobic.” explained Jenn, as she remembered how they had reacted to their daughter being around those damned to hell lesbians like Jenn. “They would never accept their daughters being lesbians.”<br />
<br />
“So to keep getting support through college at least both of them had fake boyfriends.” Stated Oliva as Theroda’s eyes narrowed a bit, she didn’t lie liars. “Don’t worry, the guys where in on it and agreed to help hide it, they didn’t lie to them about what it was about but both of them where around a lot.”<br />
<br />
“Well…now they are here as well.” Confirmed Theodora “Which means they are going to go through the same transformation as you all are.”<br />
<br />
“But they are men…” started Oliva before she remembered what Theodora had said. Basically Merman…where mermaids on the outside but with dicks in their tails so they could come out and impregnate other mermaids. “So they are…going to change as well.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Theodora as she eyed the now six former humans. “I may need to call in help, we normally don’t have groups larger then three.”</p>
