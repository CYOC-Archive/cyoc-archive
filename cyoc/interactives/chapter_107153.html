<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fuck Kev! I&#39;m feeling it happening to me!&quot; Matron wrapped his arms around his tummy, as he hunched back into the corner, bracing for what&#39;s going to happen. &quot;I feel...like it&#39;s gonna...it&#39;s gonna...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way dude! It&#39;s not gonna happen to you...ugh!&quot; Kevin isn&#39;t fairing off any better, his dick surprisingly still running at full mast. But for how long? Time awaits only for the inevitable.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s gonna...it&#39;s gonna! Ahaha...Hahaha.&quot; Matron felt his face rosy up, his voice taking on a hazy, drunkier state as he proceeded to. &quot;HAHAHA! What&#39;s the use?! I&#39;m still gonna end up straight as an arrow after this and forever be a Virgin as myself or be this disgusting homophobe that fucks his wrinkly wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matron stared at Kevin smiling drunkily, tears and an aftertaste of their kiss left behind on his face. His shorts began seeping down slightly, temporarily as it exposed his yellowish pale ass, which seemingly seemed to get firmer, and tanner by the second. <br />
<br />
Eventually it became even former and sturdier than Mark&#39;s was ever before, a new mental note in mind about staying fit and handsome for his lovely wife at home furthered Matron&#39;s despair, mixed between a blush and a remaining arousal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me then you fucking faggot! Haha fuck me.&quot; He shouted as he got into a doggy position, his newly silky crocs underwear sinking down with his formalizing shorts dropped all the way to his tanned, smooth muscular thighs, Caribbean seafood does wonders to your body.<br />
<br />
Kevin was in no better shape, thankfully it was due to him knowing he isn&#39;t alone in this current situation, and he wasn&#39;t willing to let this go so easily. He bravely unzipped his jeans, ignoring the fact that they&#39;re already shifting to the Teacher traditional shit they are becoming, and took out of aroused member, to his surprise, he saw the process happening.<br />
<br />
It was like a meter, a tanned meter on how much the process has taken hold of a person with the curse, his brain analyzed. Kevin was amazed he can even conclude things from it, before realizing that he&#39;s soon to be becoming Percival and then sighed, despite the growing straight PhD part of his mind being proud of his intelligence.<br />
<br />
He irresistibly adjusted his package, feeling the mixture of thoughts of Percival&#39;s Wife and the lingering attraction to Matron intwine at the moment, noticing his very own member and his hormones feeling confident. In an instant, he made a bold move to the other soon to be teacher with a SWOOSH!<br />
<br />
&quot;AH!&quot; Matron shouted, feeling Kevin&#39;s large Asian member sticking into him. One side feeling an immense amount of pleasure like he&#39;s always desired, the other feeling confusion and drunken anger that Percival is doing this to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kev...Kev...Percival! What are you DOING?!&quot; Matron tilted his head directly to Kevin, noticing the grand perfect posture the soon to be Doctor holding along with his shorter but tougher height. <br />
<br />
Bottom parts, pants turning into a pair of timberland cargo pants and shoes becoming brown and polished as ever. A full break on an Oxford pair of dress shoes. The way he carried himself was completely different, maybe even slightly intimidating. <br />
<br />
With arrogance and a Chinese standard to be the best took hold of that relaxed free persona he used to have. Kevin thrusted in back and forth , abet unwillingly, as his hair became simple and formal and lost its dye completely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Matron...&quot; He spoke pompously, almost as though he knew everything and that he&#39;s the center and the King. <br />
<br />
AdjustIng his glasses as they turned rectangular and stern, he briefly opened his eyes momentarily and took out his jacket. <br />
<br />
Tossing it completely to the side corner of the room whilst letting the name tag slide down his neck, in mid transformation as he closed his eyes shut once more and smirked with absolute arrogance. &quot;Just do keep quiet you drunk homo, before I have to come spank you like I do with my kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark wanted to rebut, his tight pinstripe shirt was killing him with the heat despite the air conditioning in the staff room, he wanted to strangle Percival for the dishonor against his family and religion. But Matron wouldn&#39;t allow that.<br />
<br />
He simply closed his eyes like what Percival-Kevin did. Allowed the intoxication of this drunk body to take over as the tanned lines took over his former face and race from now on. His hair buzzed at the time and a nice dark colored beard took over his chin. Too drunk to care as he bore willingly of the new thoughts coming in, almost exploding with new heterosexual urges.<br />
<br />
Kevin simply allowed his smart-ass, strict Asian father self to take over. On a compromise visualizing that the man was in fact his wife in front and that they were having another kid to the family, which really made him a proud family man. It really helped that Mark&#39;s ass actually...felt like one.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was due to his attraction to Matron? Kevin thought once, before Percival rampaged and began having hard sex with his &quot;wife&quot; . His dance shirt turning tight and buff with his solid pecs and abs.<br />
<br />
He was always one of the guys who&#39;ve managed to go commando, as in being on of the most experienced soldiers from his country&#39;s army before he migrated to Britain where he met the love of his wife. <br />
<br />
As he thought about her and the sex that they are having, his biceps hardened and his wrists aged, lifting weights and doing push ups. His face squared and dominance rising along with his authority as memories plunged into him as he thrusted, almost to climax. <br />
<br />
Thinking about tradition, conservativeness. The two of them held on, with hetero urges denying gay, gay? Mark Riches clasped the ring on his ring finger and stared bloodshot eyes at the fucking Dr Percival Chang dominating him, he always knew that perfectionist was gay. <br />
<br />
&quot;PERCIVALLLLLLL!&quot; He bellowed, once more before the haze of tons of scotch and beer hang him over to dream land. But not before snapping Dr Percival out of his trance and PSSSSSSHHHH! He let load of his ex-army man seed onto Dr Mark Riches, snapping out of the old reality and into the new.<br />
<br />
Dr Percival Chang always had a crush on the friendlier male during his Uni days. Him being nervous and awkward was due to fear of anyone finding out he was gay , especially in the past during the olden days. Both in army and in school, even as a teacher. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want anyone to find out and risk his reputation, because he strove for excellence and perfection being an Asian. In which he&#39;s managed to accomplished mind and body, but his soul still ached for many years.<br />
<br />
He thought that he could repress these urges, make the gay go away, he thought. He had a Wife in which he cared deeply about, but never felt that deep connection like he did with Mark Riches. He mostly lectured and was authoritative to his sons because he felt inner guilt and anger that he could never fully get rid of these urges.<br />
<br />
With his larger and more toned biceps, Percival carried the Indian-Caribbean man onto the lounge Sofa, wiped himself dry and put a blanket over the passed out man. <br />
<br />
Weekly inviting him out for drinks once a week at a scheduled timing so no one would interfere with his plans, taking advantage of his crush and soulmate...even though knowingly that he hated homosexuals. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t like doing this as it was kinda illegal, but it was the only way for him to be with Mark Riches. At least that&#39;s how he felt. Talking to him , taking care of him when he&#39;s drunk and stressed of life...with some &quot;friendly benefits&quot; in order to get rid of his stress in life.<br />
<br />
He picked up his ring and watch and placed it in his pocket. Sat on the Couch, giving the snoring doctor a kiss on the lips and continued grading the papers of his students. <br />
<br />
Wishing that he would return the affection like a distant dream Percival had of the both of them.</p>
