<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harper’s screen lit up with an icon that said ‘Roll Dice!’<br />
Without much thinking, she pressed it. Her single 6 sided die appeared on everyone’s screen,<br />
<br />
Harper Has Rolled: 6<br />
<br />
“Wow, six already,” Adam said,<br />
“I usually have pretty great luck,” Harper replied with a cocky attitude.<br />
On her screen, only for her to see, appeared a string of text similar to a haiku,<br />
“What’s this?” She asked,<br />
“That’ll be your riddle. It’ll hint, or outright tell you, whatever your change is going to be,” Adam explained, “you should read it aloud, it’s more fun that way!”<br />
“Fine,” Harper said.<br />
<br />
She started, “New Player gaining such a high score,<br />
Perhaps you should try gaining some more!”<br />
“Gaining?” Judy questioned,<br />
<br />
Before anyone could ask any further questions though, there was an audible groan of discomfort from Harpers end of the session,<br />
“Oooh… why do I feel so bloated…” she complained, placing her hand on her belly,<br />
“I think I know what it meant by gaining now,” Adam said, a smirk appearing on his face. He then said, “let the games begin,” very subtly.<br />
<br />
— Harper —<br />
On Harpers end of the session, her belly was clearly beginning to bloat, raising her hand as it did so. Before long, the upper part of her torso also began to expand, making her chest and breasts thicker and meatier,<br />
“What the hell is happening!” She yelled, “I-I’m getting fatter!!” She shouted in horror.<br />
Her thighs were barely visible to the camera but were undeniably getting thicker, and it could be assumed the same would apply for her calves. Her arms bloated, gaining thickness all over, even her fingers seemed to add a little extra padding. Her face swelled, her cheeks blowing up and a double chin developing.<br />
After maybe 30 seconds of Harper gaining about 5 pounds per second, her growth stopped.<br />
Sat in her chair, the formerly skinny white girl was suddenly a bloated 320 pound woman. Her clothing hadn’t ripped, but was definitely a lot more snug around her body. Her previously exposed midriff was now a bloated and exposed belly.<br />
— Harper —<br />
<br />
“What the hell!!” She screamed, sat on her chair with her body nearly seeping off the sides of the arm-rests,<br />
“This is the game, my friend,” Adam said, “I did warn you, and the game warned you too!”<br />
“Hey, Adam…” Trenton said, “I’m gonna be honest… as much as I understand the whole ‘this game will transform you’ gig, I don’t think any of us understood that this is what you— or the game meant by that,”<br />
“Yeah I’m gonna second that,” Judy chimed in, “but I guess we… we have to finish it if we want to leave,”<br />
“Yep,” Adam said, “trust me, it’s really fun! You just have to get used to it, and they changes don’t hold back,”<br />
“Right…” Judy said, “still, Harper are you okay?” She asked,<br />
<br />
“Do I LOOK okay!?” She said, angrily, unable to even touch herself,<br />
“You look…” Judy hesitated,<br />
“Big?” Adam pushed, clearly pissing Harper off, “don’t worry. The game has an unspoken amount of consistency. At least as far as I’ve played, you’re not going to get two BIG changes in a row. You get time to cool off,”<br />
“That makes me feel SO much better,” Harper said before huffing in frustration. She finally sat back in her chair, crossing her arms over her expanded torso, “ugh! I’m so much squishier!”<br />
“You get used to it,” Adam said, “now, my turn!” He said with excitement in his voice. He pressed his mouse down and on everyone’s screen his dice rolled,<br />
<br />
Adam Has Rolled: 6<br />
<br />
“Wow, two in a row,” he said, “who would’ve expected that,” he said to himself. He cleared his throat,<br />
“So invested, a returning player,<br />
How about that hair, let’s make it greyer!”<br />
<br />
“That’s a little obvious,” Harper said,<br />
“And less severe,” Trenton added,<br />
<br />
— Adam —<br />
“Trust me guys, it really varies in severity,” he said.<br />
Very visible on his camera, various strands of his hair began to lighten from their original black colour, but remained curly none-the-less. Soon, his moustache began to change, as well as his soul patch and the rest of his beard.<br />
In the span of about 15 seconds, Adam’s whole head of hair as well as his facial hair had changed colour to a very light grey,<br />
“Guess I know what colour my hair will be when I’m old,” he joked.<br />
The only part of his hair that didn’t turn completely grey were his eyebrows, they still remained fairly dark but still lost a fair bit of their colour.<br />
— Adam —<br />
<br />
“Definitely a lot less severe… it even suits you,” Judy said,<br />
“Not as bad as last time I played,” he said, “my first change gave me a pussy!”<br />
“R-really?” Judy said,<br />
“Yeah, super weird and different, but having an open mind makes the game more fun!”<br />
“Hard to have an open mind when I’m the size of a whale,” Harper chimed in, “can the next player roll already?” She complained impatiently,<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, that’s me!” Judy said. She hesitated, but clicked on the screen. Her dice rolled,<br />
<br />
Judy Has Rolled: 3<br />
<br />
“Not a six, I guess that’s a start,” she bit her lip in anticipation whilst her text loaded,<br />
“Anticipation is not your suitor,<br />
But let’s enlarge that tiny hooter!”<br />
<br />
“M-my… hooter?”<br />
“Does it mean your tits?” Harper asked making Judy immediately blush, “what? It’s not much of a secret, we can all see them,” she stated,<br />
“Y-yeah but I’m not too vocal about them!” She complained. But before she could question any further, she felt a slight itch on her face.<br />
<br />
— Judy —<br />
She scratched her nose once. Then twice. Then suddenly realised what the change meant. With a fairly awkward tickling feeling, Judy’s nose began to enlarge. It wasn’t growing forward much, however, but generally growing larger across her face. It looked flatter with how it was growing, and soon her nostrils were growing wider. She was looking at herself through her camera’s output, and was amazed by the whole change.<br />
By the end of the 10 seconds, Judy’s nose had gone from small and cute to large and very noticeable. Honestly, it was harder to look away from her nose than her other distracting assets.<br />
— Judy —<br />
<br />
“Can you smell any better?” Harper teased. Judy found her comment fairly amusing and clapped back with,<br />
“You feeling any hungrier?”<br />
Despite Harper’s disappointment and general discomfort with her change, she couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the joke. In fact, she even started to laugh, quickly turning it into a real belly laugh (ironically) which then spread to the rest of the group.<br />
Everyone was laughing at each other by the end.<br />
Trenton, in the middle of his laugh, accidentally pressed his mouse. Lucky for him, it was his turn.<br />
<br />
Trenton Has Rolled: 1<br />
<br />
“Ah shit,” he said,<br />
“There’s always one,” Adam joked, making everyone let out a chuckle or a groan,<br />
“Laughter in the air makes these situations much less scary,<br />
But see how you deal when you’re much more hairy!”<br />
<br />
“That’s not hard to decipher,” Trenton said,<br />
“Oh nice!” Adam cheered,<br />
“W-what?”<br />
“You got a hairy one! I always wanted to try that out. I can never grow more than this amount of facial hair. I wanted to know what it’ll be like,” he finished,<br />
“Huh,” Trenton said, “well I guess I’ll let you know how it goes,” he said, awkwardly, unsure of how to respond to Adam’s out of pocket remark. But he needn’t dwell long before he started to feel itchy… everywhere.<br />
<br />
—Trenton—<br />
The first sign of his change came from his actual hair. Without much question, his already fairly long blonde hair began to grow, making his hair not just grow longer, but gain a fair amount of volume.<br />
His next change came from his beard. His light stubble starting getting a lot thicker, growing into a much larger and bushier beard.<br />
Before that even finished, suddenly his eyebrows started growing. Getting bushier all together, but even between them began to grow creating a large and thick mono-brow.<br />
As his head was changing, Trenton could feel more happening down below.<br />
The hair on his arms was beginning to grow longer, thicker. From it’s original almost invisible blonde colour to a darker and hairier coat that covered the majority of his arm. The hair on his fingers grew, and it spread over hands too.<br />
At the same time, his chest hair was getting incredibly hairy, enough to put it into a pony-tail. The same applied to his stomach, his back, everything on his upper body was getting coated in a thick layer of body hair.<br />
His legs grew like his arms, maybe even more. Spreading down to his feet, looking like a halfling’s foot as well as his toes gaining their fair share of hair.<br />
Finally, after perhaps a whole minute of growth, the hair slowed and stopped. His whole face was almost entirely covered in hair. His hair wasn’t straight, it was wavy, thick and had a fair amount of volume over length. His beard was similar. Thick and hairy, not quite too long, but defintiely enough to be mistaken for a carpet.<br />
He pulled back a part of his sleeve and revealed a very thick coat of dark blonde hair covering his arm.<br />
He opened the top of his shirt and peeked inside,<br />
“Holy shit,” he said aloud.<br />
—Trenton—<br />
<br />
“No way, you gotta show us!” Adam said,<br />
“What!?” Trenton replied, “I-I…” he stuttered,<br />
“C’mon. We’re never gonna see each other again. Things are only gonna get crazier and weirder. I’m more than open to showing anything on this camera if everyone else is open to it,”<br />
“A-actually… that’s a good point,” Judy said,<br />
“What are you talking about!?” Harper called out, “you’re meant to be the other girl here, you can’t ‘succumb to these perverts’ like that!”<br />
“Umm, I’m down to be called a pervert in this session. Deep down, we’re all here to have a good time, to change in crazy ways. If you don’t show yourself off and play along, the games gonna expose you anyways! Plus, I’m totally gay,” he finished,<br />
“I think it’s a good point,” Judy said, “I think that if we want to have a good time… we’re gonna have to exit our comfort zone a little,”<br />
“Alright, fine,” Harper said, “I’ll play along, as long as you show off your tits,”<br />
<br />
“WHAT!?” Judy yelled, “W-WHY!?”<br />
“Because then you’re ‘exiting your comfort zone’ or some shit,”<br />
“That’s a bit much,” Trenton said, “I’m open to taking my shirt off and showing everyone my chest, I was just awkward about it because—”<br />
“Not about you anymore, hairy boy, if you wanna play this game, then we all have to exit our comfort zones seriously,”<br />
<br />
“You know what…” Judy said after several seconds of silence, “fuck it,” she said with absolute confidence. She lifted her shirt up and revealed her completely nude chest.<br />
Harper looked shocked, Adam looked amazed, and Trenton… Trenton didn’t really know what to think, he was just about to take his own shirt off, but clearly he didn’t need to anymore.<br />
“Holy shit… I did not expect you to do that,” Harper said, “I-I guess…” she stuttered, but found what she wanted to say fairly quickly, “I respect you for doing that. I’m sorry for pressuring you into doing that,”<br />
“No no,” Judy replied, “I think you’re definitely an asshole for doing that, but I feel… refreshed. I don’t have much else to hide from you guys now I guess,”<br />
<br />
“Alright…” Adam said, “Trenton show off your pubic hair!”<br />
“What the fuck is wrong with you, dude,” Trenton said,<br />
“No that’s an amazing idea!” Judy said, “I doubt we’ll be able to see your dick if the hair has grown that much, that’ll be really interesting to see!”<br />
“I third that,” Harper chirped in,<br />
“You are all totally weird, but Judy showed off her breasts… so fine,” he said. He stood up, allowing his lower body to be in view of the camera. He undid his jeans button by button, revealing his boxers. From right above his boxers there was already the dark blonde pubic hair poking through. As he pulled his boxers down, the pubic hair almost exploded like an Afro out of the boxers. The huge bush looked like a forest with his dense it was.<br />
Judy was right, his dick was almost invisible behind it all,<br />
“That’s insane,” Trenton said, “I really wasn’t expecting that at all…”<br />
<br />
“Harper,” Adam said, looking away from Trenton’s camera, “I think you owe us something now,”<br />
“Excuse me, you didn’t even show anything,” she snapped back,<br />
“I’ll show anything anyone wants me to. I’m already in my comfort zone,”<br />
“Alright then, show off your cock,” she demanded,<br />
“Done,” he said. He stood up, unbuckled his own belt, and whipped out his meat. It was fairly sized and a little erect,<br />
“Having a good time, huh?” Judy commented, making everyone else chuckle,<br />
“It’s the changes. I can’t help but get turned on by them,” as he finished, his cock twitched slightly,<br />
“Okay I’ve had enough of that!” Harper said, everyone laughing but agreeing with her.<br />
<br />
Both Trenton and Adam sat back down, putting their respective lower bodies away.<br />
“So,” Adam started, “everyone ready for round two?” He asked.<br />
<br />
Without much hesitation, everyone unanimously agreed.</p>
