<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">- Grand Colosseum -<br />
<br />
Vect stared across the 15 foot distance separating him from Sara&#39;s brother for a few moments to figure out what he was going to say while the announcer was playing the herald to both fighters. <br />
&quot;So you&#39;re Sara&#39;s brother,&quot; he finally decided on, trying to be friendly, &quot;nice to meet you finally.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have no sister,&quot; he responded coldly. It was true that there was no family resemblance between them. While he was  blonde to Sara&#39;s black hair, he had freckles while she had none, her higher cheekbones contrasted to his hooked nose.<br />
&quot;You are Stanley Zagan right,&quot; he Vect asked, maybe he had the wrong person.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Stanley&#39;s blue eyes seemed to want to bore into Vect&#39;s very soul. &quot;But she is no sister of mine. That monster may have wormed her way into my parent&#39;s home, but as for me she is nothing. And you must Vect, the idiot second son to Corellion Whitewood. It truly is astounding you made it this far.&quot;<br />
Vect&#39;s welcoming expression became a mask for his true feelings, as he fell back on his childhood upbringing about keeping others guessing at your mood.  But inside, he felt anger. <br />
(Careful Vect) Erress cautioned (he may just be trying to just get under your skin.)<br />
(He has damn well succeeded at that) Vect replied, his knuckles turning white as they tightened around the sword&#39;s hilt.<br />
(If you want to defend your mate&#39;s honor, defeat this welp. Crush him, but don&#39;t loose focus) Erress warned.<br />
(Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right.) Vect calmed himself down and readied for the horn to sound. He planted his feet and got ready to strike.<br />
&#39;Sorry Sara, but I&#39;m going to enjoy this a bit too much I think.&#39; Then the horn bellowed.<br />
<br />
- Bertrand&#39;s Mixtures -<br />
<br />
Alyvia finished setting up the acid drip just as the horn blast echoed through the city. In one corner lay the potion shop&#39;s owner, or what was left of him. <br />
&quot;If set up properly, the acid drip will burn through the containment vessel in 15 minutes,&quot; Maximillian had explained to her, &quot;Once damaged, the spell will be broken and all creatures inside will be unleashed through a portal and start attacking anyone they see, save those with the marker coins ofcourse.&quot; <br />
&quot;This is going to be quite the show,&quot; she smiled, casting an invisibility spell and leaving.<br />
<br />
- Grand Colosseum Stands -<br />
<br />
Sara cradled the wooden bowl in her lap, watching the match below her rage on. The icecream Vesper had returned with had helped her some, but she still felt cold inside as Vect and Stanley traded blows. Vect sidestepped another of Stanley&#39;s attacks and then attempted his own over handed slash, only for it to blocked by Stanley&#39;s shield. <br />
&quot;They are both proving to be capable fighters,&quot; someone behind Sara spoke. She turned around to see the source of the voice. Sitting just above them was Salazar Ortega, his dragonic face looking down at her. &quot;But to be honest, I&#39;m really hoping your friend wins.&quot; Sara just nodded and turned back to the fight down below. <br />
<br />
Vect had managed to get in a few good blows, but then again so did Stanley. He backpedaled to get some distance between them. He then cast a regeneration spell to heal some of his wounds. The soothing feeling washed over him as his wounds slowly disappeared. But he saw a similar light come from Stanley.<br />
&#39;Oh right, paladins can heal themselves. This is going to take awhile,&#39; Vect thought glumly. And they clashed again when Stanley went on the offensive. Vect using the flat of his sword to block another hammer blow and then another. On the third Vect sidestepped to the right and pushed toward Stanley, shoulder checking him and then jabbing the pommel of his sword into Stanley&#39;s stomach. In response, Stanley used his shield as another weapon to bring down on Vect&#39;s head. Vect was able to move his head, but his shoulder wasn&#39;t spared, any harder and his arm might have been dislocated. They separated and circled each other for a possible opening. <br />
<br />
- The Mages School -<br />
&quot;What are we doing here exactly,&quot; Eva asked.<br />
&quot;Something has been bothering me for awhile now, and it now clicked thanks to you,&quot; Freed answered.<br />
&quot;What did I say exactly?&quot;<br />
&quot;Almost everyone is at the Colosseum right now,&quot; he turned down the next hallway and continued, &quot;when I had my, um run in with Ms. Char in the library, I noticed the restricted section door was open, and it&#39;s never ever left open. What if someone had charmed her and went in to steal some books and scrolls?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, we all kinda figured that, which is why they increased security at the library since then,&quot; Eva remarked.<br />
&quot;A few extra constructs aren&#39;t going to stop someone dedicated enough,&quot; he countered, &quot;but yes any conflict would be heard by passing students or staff, unless they&#39;re distracted or away by a certain tournament.&quot; He stopped in front of the library doors. &quot;And there should be 2 golems standing here. Wait here, if there is trouble, send the message and then come help me please.&quot;<br />
Eva nodded and stepped to the side, out of sight and Freed pushed open the door. He stepped into the dark library, his steps echoing in the room. After a few feet in, he stopped and stood in silence, looking around the room and his spade tipped tail twitching slightly. Freed had given up on wearing his glasses, and let people see his frightening eyes. &quot;Celine is right, I am ashamed of what I look like,&quot; he had explained to Eva as they&#39;d left the Apothicarium, &quot;I&#39;m still gonna keep the biped form, the other is a little large for indoors.&quot; <br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re here,&quot; he called.<br />
----<br />
Celine felt her muscles tense up, &#39;he has to be bluffing. There is no way he could have known they were in here. She looked around at the other infiltrators that had come with her.<br />
&quot;Its just one, we can kill him quick enough and get on with this,&quot; a satyr whispered.<br />
&quot;No, he may be bluffing. Let&#39;s wait,&quot; Graham ordered. He was the leader of their operation, a skilled human from the thieves school.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll count to 10 and you had best come out Akemos,&quot; Freed said. &quot;If you don&#39;t I&#39;m gonna start a book burning.&quot;<br />
Celine looked at the blue skinned demonkin, who shook his head and mouthed &#39;how?&#39;<br />
&quot;You gave up a bit too quick in our match Akemos,&quot; Freed explained. &quot;I&#39;ve talked to a few of your friends and they said you were never one to give up so quick,&quot; Freed began to walk forward and created a fireball in each hand, &quot;my question is, was it you in the library a few months ago?&quot;<br />
Before anyone could stop him, Akemos stepped out of the shadows and smiled arrogantly at the half-elf. <br />
&quot;Very good, but now what? You&#39;re fire wasn&#39;t actually affecting me in the arena, a bit cold for my taste.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; Freed asked.<br />
&quot;Why? Because I see how we&#39;re treated by most other races. I see how these short lived races aren&#39;t able to properly govern themselves, especially humans. They&#39;re like rodents, breeding so quickly and unrestrained.&quot;<br />
Freed began to laugh, &quot;nice try, but an explanation like that doesn&#39;t work very well here. You&#39;re best friends are human, and you have human blood in your line. Try again.&quot;<br />
Loosing patience with the whole charade, Celine used a spell to slam the doors shut and jump out from behind the shelves.<br />
Freed looked stunned and he hesitated to throw his spells until Akemos and 2 others attacked, then he let loose. A moment later, Eva kicked in the door and charged in axe held high, the fight was on.<br />
<br />
- Grand Colosseum -<br />
At the Colosseum Vect was still in a fierce fight against Stanley. He struck Stanley&#39;s shield when he got a rapid message about some kind of attack at the mages school library. The unexpected mental message disoriented him long enough for Stanley to swing his hammer into Vect&#39;s chest, breaking a few ribs and knocking him on his back. &quot;Wait stop something is wrong,&quot; Vect tried to warn him, but he wasn&#39;t listening and raised his hammer and swung down, empowering the strike with his Paladin abilities. Vect was just barely able to bring his sword up to intercept the blow, the strike ringing out and sending tremors up his arms. Stanley swiftly followed up with another blow and brought it down, striking the sword, and then it shattered in a flash of light. Vect could only stare in disbelief at the remains of his sword, still holding the hilt. Stanley raised his hammer up for the final blow and the a loud explosion rumbled through the air, and a light shimmered in the west, towards the city markets.<br />
In the sky a pillar of red light shone up from the forming portal. Then the monsters started to pour out.<br />
<br />
- Mages School Library - <br />
<br />
A low rumble shook the battle at the library.<br />
&quot;What was that,&quot; Eva demanded.<br />
&quot;Now, the fun begins,&quot; Celine smirked and she lept at Freed.</p>
