<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     While his mother cooked dinner, Kyle started researching his condition on his phone, Spontaneous Multilimb Syndrome, or SMS had been named after two cases were identified publicly, himself, and Jen. The third had remained private, but the cases were rising by the day, SMS was seen as a slight epidemic, but more of a annoyance, since any limbs grown functioned perfectly as if they had always been there. It seemed that the limbs that were grown were copies of someone else&#39;s limbs. Two types of growth were known, a random type, which was what Jen was hit with in the current reality, gaining sets of limbs copied from people nearby. And Subconscious, which was what hit Kyle, being given copies of limbs from someone, or several persons that were admired by the victim.<br />
<br />
     More new memories hit him, he had been in middle school, and they had a visit from Mrs. Lorenza, who was there to substitute for their science teacher at the time, she hadn&#39;t been hired to the high school just yet, and she was at the time, the most beautiful woman Kyle had ever seen. Being young and just starting to realize his attraction to girls, she stunned him, a pure and utter young crush. It had been a week after that he woke up screaming at the sight of four much larger pairs of the woman&#39;s legs surrounding his. It was a shock for everyone who viewed it, and traumatized him at the time. Mrs. Lorenza for her part wasn&#39;t aware of this situation until she saw Kyle walk into her science class in freshmen year with four identical copies of her legs, she knew they were hers by a birthmark on the right thigh. This new student&#39;s presence made her very uncomfortable, and she made it apparent after the first class.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t teach you, not with you being like that.&quot; She spat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything! It just happened to me you can&#39;t seriously believe I have your legs to spit you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been touching their... MY pussy. Haven&#39;t you?&quot; Kyle blushed and looked away for a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their just there, and attached to me, I can&#39;t.... I can&#39;t help it, these legs... Your legs are so beautiful.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mrs. Lorenza gave him a stare that could blow a hole through his head, she stared at the boy, this disgusting teenager that had not one but four copies of her legs, and he had been violating her by proxy. Closing her eyes she sighed in exasperation, the kid didn&#39;t understand how this bothered her, but she knew it wasn&#39;t his fault. She got up and closed the door for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Kyle. Tell me everything.&quot; Fortunately for Kyle this was the last class of the day, he spent the next hour going over all of the troubles having these legs had been giving him, and as the conversation continued Mrs. Lorenza softened her tone. She revealed that a big reason she was uncomfortable was that she was gay, he kept apologizing for touching them, and swore he would never do it again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look.... those are your legs, you can do what you want with them, but if you&#39;re going to be in my class, I want you to at least know how I feel about this. Now, lift one of your right legs as high as you can.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, I&#39;m curious if SMS copied by flexibility as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
     Kyle raised an eyebrow to this memory, and lifted one of his legs as far as he could, it literally kept going until he was doing a split, his right set&#39;s right leg laying across not only his center lap, but his foot touching the left sets thighs. Kyle finished reading what information there was on SMS as the rest of his memory started filling in, Mrs. Lorenza was now not only comfortable with him owning these copies of her legs, she was friends with his mom and him. His mother called him to dinner and Kyle shut his phone off.<br />
<br />
     Kyle crawled into bed, the mass of legs and hips making it hard to get comfortable, he experimented, trying all sorts of positions until he found an awkwardly arousing one. He had moved his rear legs to lay flat against his back, which was weirdly comfortable and he found himself absently caressing his thighs and eventually he found himself hooking both sets of legs with his arms and pulling them over his shoulders, experimenting with how he could move these new parts, he found his head flanked by the luscious calves and feet of his rear legs, their feet were resting on the pillow with his head, he looked to his left and right seeing his own feet, pulled them close to smother his head, and fell asleep. The next morning he found his rear hips aching, &quot;Okay, I won&#39;t do this again.... hot though.&quot; He rubbed his face against the feet, kissed and kissed all four of them. &quot;Sorry girls, you have to sleep with the others.... the fuck is wrong with me, I&#39;m talking to my feet..... Well at least I know I can meet that fetish.&quot; Kyle got up and got ready for school, dressing all of his legs in jeans, his center wearing them baggy, the rest not so much, and slipped on all five pairs of slip on tennis shoes. <br />
<br />
     As the week progressed he didn&#39;t see much of Jen, usually missing her in the halls, catching a glimpse of her here and there, Kyle discovered that not only was he friends with his original friends, but some of the more popular students had been talking to him more. He explored this new social position and eventually on Friday he found himself sitting at the table with a few old friends and a cheerleader or two. Social dynamics had started shifting, because of the strange new kid and his four gorgeous extra legs, clicks started to break down, and the student body had started talking to each other more. He was starting to really like this reality. On this particular day Kyle got a visit from someone he wasn&#39;t expecting, she sat down with him, right across from him at the cafeteria table was Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kyle.&quot; Jen smiled mischievously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Jen.&quot; He smiled back, genuinely, &quot;I think we should talk somewhere alone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Jen cocked an eyebrow. They got up and made their way out into the hall away from the other students.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.... first fuck you Jen. And second, couldn&#39;t you have at least set these....&quot; He gestured to all of his legs &quot;...in a little more convenient position. I mean seriously, do you know how hard it is to shave legs that are aimed backwards, I literally have to move to the side and shave them in a mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? That&#39;s your first complaint?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve gotten used to these, I kinda love them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, it was a good gift, although I hadn&#39;t expected the curse to change reality like this. Did you see about that guy in Arizona, he didn&#39;t just grow a few limbs, he grew a few bodies.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, poor guy, I hope he&#39;s doing alright, just the legs alone are weird, so how are yours behaving?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fantastic,&quot; she patted her asses, &quot;It&#39;s a little hard finding pants for them, luckily I don&#39;t need them. Speaking of, where did you get yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two went on until the bell rung for the next period and they agreed to meet up again later.<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
     It had been a month, and Kyle had a really good life, Jen and he had become friends, and things were looking up. But there was something that he had an itch to do, he was getting the urge to use the curse on someone, to continue this cycle and unload some frustration on someone, and he knew just who. A guy named Greg, Greg had been a bully, and still picked on him when he saw him, ever since he grew these legs, Greg had ramped up the intensity of his mockery, going as far as calling him a slut and a fag, and now Kyle knew what he wanted to do. He approached Greg after school one day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, queer boy came to see me, just because you have four pussies doesn&#39;t mean anyone wants some!&quot; Greg snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I got a question for you Greg. Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
