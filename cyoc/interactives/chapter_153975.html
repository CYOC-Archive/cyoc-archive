<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Spookyville was going on, there still was other things going on in the world. But because some of them affected either Animalians, or Animalia in general, in one way or another, there was still things to talk about.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
One thing that made Adi really happy was the official report that the leader of ISIS was finally confirmed as killed, since she held him personally responsible for her parent&#39;s death. While this news would help her adapt to Animalia, there were still some things that were considered &quot;off-limits&quot; to her.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Another funny thing actually happened to Oka, Annie and Stuart the week before, but Oka was talking about it now. While it wasn&#39;t bad, it was considered funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damian was taking us to a car show in Vegas to show off Annie and Stuart&#39;s car.&quot; said Oka, who was done up as a forest &quot;priestess&quot;, &quot;While on the way, we pulled into the left lane to avoid a buildup of traffic. But we didn&#39;t know that someone was not only using the left lane, he was also driving way over the limit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you wreck?&quot; asked one of her friends, apprehensively, mainly because one of those &quot;cool cars&quot; didn&#39;t deserve to be totaled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; answered Oka, &quot;The speeding car had to brake, much to his clear annoyance. He was apparently so annoyed that he pulled in front of us and climbed out of his pickup truck ready to rumble. Damian got out, &#39;cause he was quite capable of fighting in such cases.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding.&quot; said another of her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully he didn&#39;t need to,&quot; replied Oka, &quot;because a cop had seen the whole thing. Despite a hilariously feeble attempt to pin the blame on Damian and/or us for his reckless driving and threat of violence, there was no getting out of it and the reckless driver ended up with a ticket. Damian, however, only got a warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was also a relatively minor incident at the haircut place that Roxanne worked at that did cause some worry, but worked out well for some people, but not everyone.<br />
<br />
A black man brought in two sons who looked like they were in middle school for haircuts, but before the father could tell Roxanne what he wanted for his boys, his phone went off and he had to go outside to answer it. Something about the father tripped her PTSD &quot;alarm&quot;, and by the time the man came back inside, both the sons had really bad, patchy, and uneven haircuts.<br />
<br />
But what was most surprising was the fact that that was what the father intended all along. According to the father, his sons had a few bad grades, and they weren&#39;t improving them like the father wanted. So his intended punishment was to give them really bad haircuts, which is what Roxanne did, much to her surprise. As thanks, the father paid her twice the usual cost for haircuts and gave her a tip for being &quot;psychic&quot;.<br />
<br />
But during Spookyville, while spending time with Anne and her fellow &#39;sisters&#39;, Roxanne got an email with a link that showed that the father had made a video of the aftermath and the reason behind those bad haircuts. While everyone with her enjoyed it, it was clear from the comments that everyone was split. While some were clearly mad for the public humiliation, others thought that this was a good way to make them do better in school.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Because the special event was a bounty hunt for members of a criminal organization who had hijacked Spookyville&#39;s candy (inspired in part by the games <I>Costume Quest</I> and <I>Oddworld: Stranger&#39;s Wrath</I>), there were some things that were both amusing and annoying, mainly the names of the leaders who were in charge of the gangs.<br />
<br />
Both Jack and Mary Piper, for example, found that the name of one of the outlaw leaders was &quot;Packrat Palooka&quot; was a little offensive because real packrats weren&#39;t like human &#39;hoarders&#39;.<br />
<br />
But there were some things that were a little confusing to those who weren&#39;t familiar with organized crime.<br />
<br />
&quot;This part is supposed to represent one of the unfortunate parts of organized crime, especially for some of our members.&quot; explained Grim, who was in charge of Spookyville&#39;s &quot;Bounty Store&quot; as Angie went up to someone who was dressed in a mad doctor&#39;s costume, &quot;Black market medical procedures.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, Angie,&quot; said the &#39;doctor&#39;, &quot;You&#39;ll be happy to hear that I&#39;ve worked up an ingenious solution to your, uh...&quot; he turned to look at the other members of the group, before stage &#39;whispering&#39;, &quot;little problem.&quot; Which Angie didn&#39;t &#39;elaborate&#39;, as part of the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; continued the doctor, &quot;Well, due to the... &#39;unique nature&#39; of your case, the operation is shaping up to be somewhat... complicated.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just a fancy word for &#39;expensive&#39;.&quot; said Peter to Mr. Hyun and Ling.<br />
<br />
As it turned out the unknown procedure required $20,000, while Angie said that she &#39;needs this (operation) to survive&#39;. When this video ended up on the Animalia website, there were a lot of guesses on what kind of terminal illness she had to require a $20,000 surgery<br />
<br />
Later, after &#39;Packrat Palooka&#39; was finally &#39;jailed&#39;, Grim had something for the bounty hunters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, homie.&quot; said Grim, &quot;We&#39;ve now got enough candy for Spookyville, but there&#39;s something else for you to look at.&quot; At that he put up a wanted poster with an enormous snake for the picture. But it was the words on it that made everyone a little nervous:<br />
<br />
<I>Wanted: Titanoboa Inquire at Bounty Store</I><br />
<br />
Fortunately Angie already knew much about the event so asked, &quot;What&#39;s it pay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, why don&#39;t we call him up? said Grim, bringing up a &quot;themed&quot; telephone. After he dialed in the name while everyone got a good look at the poster, a new voice came through after Grim pressed the speaker button.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Morko.&quot; said the voice, &quot;What&#39;s your business?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard you&#39;re after a Titanoboa.&quot; said Angie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you can get me a Titanoboa?&quot; asked &#39;Morko&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I know where to find one.&quot; answered Angie. &quot;For $20 Grand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It better be fresh for $20 Grand.&quot; replied &#39;Morko&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;So once I get it, where do I find you?&quot; asked Angie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, I own Jura City, Texas.&quot; said Morko (using the name for Dino City&#39;s adaptation of Spookyville), &quot;You can find me at Morko Gen Labs. I&#39;m always here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know.&quot; said Angie as she hung up. But because this was a dramatization, the bounty hunters were able to watch a scene where Morko decides to contact the boss of the Magog Cartel.<br />
<br />
The boss answered a ringing phone with a short &quot;Yeah, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Morko.&quot; said Morko in response, ignoring the way the boss answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morko! Big boss of the city.&quot; answered the crime boss, &quot;What can we do for ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bounty hunting group from Spookyville claims they can fetch me a Titanoboa.&quot; replied Morko.<br />
<br />
&quot;There ain&#39;t no Titanoboas &#39;round here.&quot; said the crime boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if there is, they&#39;re $20 Grand richer, unless you get to it first.&quot; said Morko, before hanging up.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bounty hunting group from Spookyville?&quot; said the crime boss, while hanging up his phone, before giving the order, &quot;Lock and load, boys. We&#39;ve got some hunting to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why Morko would be interested in such a thing.&quot; said Manny, before getting the bus tickets to Jura City ready for the bounty hunting group. &quot;I thought those four-armed, super snake Animalians were all extinct.&quot; (Angie was wearing a costume that she had hidden her two extra arms). &quot;I think that part of the reason he&#39;d want that is because Titanoboa is one of the few creatures that can go toe-to-toe with a T-Rex with a generally good chance of survival.<br />
<br />
It was also part of the plot that Morko Gen Labs were also the lab that was keeping the dinosaur &quot;super soldiers&quot; (a.k.a Dinotopians) for Dino City&#39;s Halloween celebration.</p>
