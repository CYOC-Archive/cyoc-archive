<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Richards had her mouth wide open. She sat in her chair staring at the egg in my hand, as if I&#39;d made a magic trick. I looked at her, still half sitting on top of the hospital bed. I was probably one of the first people she&#39;d seen who were transformed. She must not have been convinced yet, by my claim that I&#39;d been growing feathers. Reason for that was that I&#39;d neatly shaven my crotch out of shame the morning before visiting the hospital. I didn&#39;t want anybody to see my groin like that, not even myself. Even then the red fuzz on my crotch had already been practically invisible. I found out for the first time I was growing feathers down there once I inspected my crotch after laying another of those cursed eggs, during my bath time. That was also this morning.<br />
<br />
The doctor got into action again as she walked towards me with a concerned expression. She gestured me to hand over the egg, and put it aside on the desk. Next, she asked me a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t allergic to latex right?&quot;<br />
<br />
I gulped. Gloves. She was going inside of me. I didn&#39;t want to, even if it was necessary. Still I nodded.<br />
<br />
As she was starting preparations, I tried to put my thoughts elsewhere. I started absentmindedly prodding my lower belly. There was still the hardness of an object right above my entrance. Looking back to it, I shouldn&#39;t have been prodding it, as it stimulated the muscles of my uterus to contract again, in hopes to forcibly move the intruder out. I felt them coming, so this time, I closed my legs more slowly and put my right hand between. The muscles kept slowly contracting, but this time I&#39;d probably be able to hold it in, like any normal female if she&#39;s not on her period. My period normally hit 15 days from now, but it was very likely it wouldn&#39;t even come back again. I never expected myself to think this way, but in this scenario, I&#39;d have switched back to having monthly periods in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
I felt my breathing shudder and my lower body was quivering. The contractions slowed down, until the were merely some weak pushes. The doctor was too busy playing with her arguments to have noticed my odd movements. I was mostly relaxed again, only my expression a bit more worried and my heart beating a bit quickly. My vaginal muscles weren&#39;t acting up anymore and my breathing was normal.<br />
<br />
Dr. Richards had her latex gloves on. She held an object in front of her, showing it to me. It was somewhat elongated, and of a black material. She turned it to have another side of the object faced towards me, and pushed a button. It caused a bright light to be shone right into my eyes. I blinked a couple of times, and the doctor turned off the small flashlight.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see, Sarah, this object is a bit elongated. On both sides there&#39;s some glass, on the side where the object is smallest, also a small flashlight. The glass on the other side is a magnifying glass, so I can examine things through it in a little more detail. The device&#39;s objective is to see any abnormalities inside your birth canal and the entrance to your womb.&quot; She bent forward a little, bringing the device to between my legs. She asked me to spread my legs, so I did, a little bit. <br />
<br />
I felt the small device, its diameter being only millimeters wide, enter my birth canal, past my labia. The doctor was muttering something inaudible, but I didn&#39;t care to notice, as my hands clutched the side of the bed. It wasn&#39;t in pleasure, but in sheer shame and discomfort. The pleasure came a few moments later, as the device slid further and further down my entrance. It just so happened to hit a certain wall, and by chance, also my G-spot, which I myself had never found before. I let out a high yelp in surprise, and my legs were spread apart further. I felt the now ever so familiar contractions play up for a fourth time that day (first time in bath, the other three during the hospital visit at dr. Richards), and couldn&#39;t help but go into a small frenzy, as that bloody excuse of a woman kept examining my vagina. In a high almost inaudible tone (I didn&#39;t want my mother to hear), I told her to back off for a moment. She slid out the device, but along with that, another object, more specifically a smooth orb, slid through as well. As soon as that device was out of me, and the doctor held up her hands in a way of &#39;I didn&#39;t do anything&#39;, I covered up my crotch.<br />
<br />
With a last contraction my labia stretched, and an actual *pop* could be heard, a first-timer for me as well. For the second time in five minutes I was holding an egg in my hands. My hands were shaking in disgust and shame. For a moment, I just couldn&#39;t have it anymore. With a loud, frustrated cry, I threw the egg onto the ground besides the bed, and started sobbing uncontrollably. I covered my reddened face behind my hands.<br />
<br />
The thing is, that the experience of laying an egg are just as frustrating as the ability to lay eggs as a young adult girl with a reputation to uphold. The contractions of the vaginal muscles can&#39;t be controlled, and can sometimes be painfully strong, as if an actual baby is forced through the small passage. The pleasure experienced with it is supposed to be a &#39;reward&#39; from mother nature, although it only leaves the victim in a state of bliss, making her unable to take control of the situation. The pleasure keeps going on. Probably even if the egg is stuck in the birth canal. It is, as said before, a nagging pleasure, an unwanted one. Lastly, the labia of the victim painfully stretches as the egg makes it to the end of its journey through the wonders of woman.<br />
<br />
Getting back to my story, the visit to Dr. Richards office wasn&#39;t a success. During the car trip back home, to school for me, I was thinking about what the hell actually happened to the world three days ago. On the radio in the car people had been talking about a very strange phenomenon concerning the environment around us, specifically space. They were talking about how a couple of minutes after people on Earth had fallen victim to the sudden changes, including me. People saw the colour of the sun turn a little more orange, even if it was only a few shades darker. Astronomers later also saw the shades of other planets, a little further away in the solar system, change. The NASA reported that several satellites had gone offline, and couldn&#39;t be rebooted, as if they never existed. Other screens seemed to show cameras to have been substituted. One even showed a satellite filming footage from Pluto, while the last best thing the NASA had ever done was take a single picture of the dwarf planet. The footage showed that the so called &#39;heart&#39; on its surface was gone. Looking through the cosmos from the other side of Earth, people saw that stars had moved positions, or disappeared, or suddenly appeared, creating completely new constellations.<br />
<br />
Now what did this have to do with all these people changing? Some of the most highly classified scientists were theorizing about shockwaves having passed through the Earth. Not only through Earth, but also the solar system, and the Milky Way, and the rest of the universe. The shockwaves had gone from one direction to the other, in a speed that equaled the speed of light. This confirmed the gradual changes from one side of the Earth, while on the other side everything had changed in an instant. That light still had to meet the Earth.<br />
<br />
These shockwaves had altered reality for how we saw it, and created the most beautiful of things, but also the greatest abominations.<br />
<br />
My mother dropped me off at school, as was agreed.<br />
<br />
I thought of myself as an abomination. I mean, come on universe, I lay eggs! Hell, I even feel the pressure of a fourth one of the day coming. I had already laid about seven on the first day, and another ten on the second. Today was going to be even worse, considering at what rate they were passing through me. It was still only twelve in the morning. The egg-laying count wasn&#39;t increasing right?<br />
<br />
When I had first laid an egg, I only told it to some of my closest friends in a private group app. Sadly, even the most embarrassing things will be shown to the world one day, so as they found me acting weird, they asked others what was going on with me, immediately causing my, what was supposed to be a secret, to spread through their contacts like wildfire. A girl laying eggs? Ridiculous! I would&#39;ve agreed, if it weren&#39;t me.<br />
<br />
It could&#39;ve been just a rumor, something to die out eventually, or an inside joke, a prank that I was playing. But the second day, after my mother had forced me to school, there were reactions of three different kinds of people. There were the ones who thought I&#39;d pulled a prank to my friends, but ridiculed me for how it backfired and now everyone knew about it, there were the people who were looking at me weird, mostly the popular people, and there was the one single person whom I now resent the most. The one who caused my reputation to plummet down to the deepest of depths, even below rock bottom. Amanda Collins, she was already popular, but now world famous for being the girl who can fly and lift cars. The wonder woman of Danbury. And she&#39;d picked me as her arch nemesis.<br />
<br />
Since she was the only one who&#39;d changed with me, from a school of approximately one thousand students, she was the only one who thought of my story as actual truth. She ridiculed me for my change, and people first defended me, as that story could only be bullshit. What was worse, was the way she proved it. She didn&#39;t need me to do it. All she had to do, was pretend like she was walking some invisible stairs, while in reality, she was actually flying.<br />
<br />
So the crowd around the two of us reacted like a crowd should react. First they gasped at Amanda, who was flying in the air. And Amanda, who fed herself with other peoples misery, just stared at me, with a mischievous grin on her face. Others saw her looking at me, and then concluded that Amanda&#39;s theory of people changing proved my story to be true. As a result I had turned beet red, and ran off, away from the crowd, towards the toilets. It was good timing, ironically I had some eggs to lay.<br />
<br />
Now, a day later, Sarah the school chick turned real chick, had to face her fears. Somewhere inside that building, the only other transformed person was probably showing off her abilities, perhaps even beating up bullies (not using all of her power of course), and thus stay on top of the hierarchy in school. Amanda was absolutely untouchable, and she herself knew it.</p>
