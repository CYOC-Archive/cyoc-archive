<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jack, now reduced to his own disembodied penis, inches along the cold tile floor, the rest of gym class was getting done. He could feel a vibration, like thunder. Giant bare feet hit the floor on either side of him as the class headed to the locker rooms to shower after swimming. Jack felt fear. He shrank, his head retreating into his foreskin. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Gabriel felt himself step on something slimy. It skidded off across the slippery floor. He looked back to try to see what is was, but the class pressed him forward.  Weird, he thought, it almost looked like a penis. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jack flinched as the first foot pressed down on him. Then he hardened under the pressure. Luckily they missed his balls. The next foot pinched his shaft causing him to go skidding into the forest of legs. He was kicked around a few times before ending up at the side of the corridor out of traffic&#39;s way. He felt himself hardening at the attention he had just received. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Gabriel grabbed his towel from the locker, shucked off his swimsuit, flung the towel over his should and headed to the showers. The guy in front of him stopped so suddenly that Gabriel ‘s dick touched the guy’s bare butt. “Sorry” said Gabriel. The guy didn’t notice, he stared forward, “Weird…” <br />
<br />
They looked into the showers. There were puddles of white goo on the wet tile and ropes of it were hanging from the ceiling and showerheads, dripping thick gobs. One of his classmates, Jamal, stepped forward accidentally putting his foot in a puddle. “Ugh, it’s sticky!” he shouted.  Michael was more pragmatic. He said “C’mon guys, let’s turn the showers on and get it off the floor at least. It’s probably some cleaning agent or something.” Several of the guys abandoned their towels with Joe, jumped around the puddles, and turned a few of the showers on. Then Michael grabbed some extra towels, got down on his hands and knees, and pushed the towel around the room, mopping up the puddles of sticky fluid. <br />
<br />
“You’re pretty used to that, aren’t you Mike?” laughed Rick, as they watched Mike’s bare butt and balls as he skimmed around the room. “Bet your boyfriend fucks you in that position. Uh, uh, uhhh!” he thrust his bare hips forward, his long soft dick flopping around as he pretended to moan in orgasm.  Mike raised his head, looking back at them from behind his posterior. He smacked his ass, grinned, and stuck out his tongue. “Good one, guys.”<br />
<br />
The floor was clean. The guys moved to the shower heads. Gabriel hung his towel on the hook and started pumping the shampoo into his hand and running it through his long golden hair. He listened to Rick continue to mock Michael. “I bet you like it rough. With him grabbing your hair and shoving your face down on his cock!”<br />
<br />
“Shut up,” said Michael, laughing. Rick shoved him. “Did you like that? Fag?” Michael jokingly leapt at him, pushing Rick to the floor. They wrestled around. The entire shower room looked on.  <br />
<br />
Rick was on his back, his legs in the air, locking Michael’s legs in the air. He was reaching around Michael, one of his hands pinning Michael’s head to the soapy, wet floor and the other trapping Michael’s flailing leg. Michael was stuck struggling on top of Rick, his ass, dick and balls, thrust in the air for the room to see. Rick’s dick and balls were also on display, pushed out and pinned between his legs that were straining to control Michael. Gabriel thought this was a good time to soap up his own cock. <br />
<br />
Then Rick noticed something strange. He tried to push Michael off of him to flip him over, but he could not. “Let me go!” shouted Michael. “I’m trying,” said Rick, panic starting to show in his face as he struggled to get Michael off of him and out of his contorted position. Two of the other guys came over and tried to lift Rick off of Michael. They strained. “I’m stuck!” shouted one of them his limbs flailing. His chest stuck to Rick’s back.  <br />
<br />
Somebody laughed from the edge doorway to the shower room. Gabriel looked over. It was a fully clothed boy he’d seen around school. He though his name was Ty. Ty laughed again. “Why don’t the rest of you go over there to help them?” <br />
The four stuck students were writhing on the floor now. Gabriel suddenly felt a strong compulsion to go over and help. The other guys followed, leaving their shower’s jets on. The only way to approach the stuck quadro was to reach over the top of them and try to pry them apart. The first guy tried and managed just to flip the mess of flailing legs over, but then he got stuck. Each time a new guy tried, he’d get stuck as well.  <br />
<br />
Soon just Gabriel was left. The rest of his gym class was a ball of flailing legs. Their torsos and heads and arms were buried in the mass, though a few hands stuck out here and there, slapping around at the asses surrounding them, trying in vain to free their owners. “Impressed?” said Ty, pointing at the ball. <br />
<br />
“What is it?” said Gabriel, “what did you do?” Ty laughed and pointed. “Look at them. They are helpless. They can’t defend themselves. Go over there.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to get stuck.” said Gabriel. “You won’t get stuck” promised Ty. Gabriel approached. The ball was just a little shorter than him. A leg kicked out, Gabriel backed up. Ty laughed again. “Yeah watch out for the feet. But get a little closer and they can’t reach you. Feet are only good as weapons at the end of legs, not so much at the thighs.” Gabriel was being caressed by the waving buttocks and thighs of his peers. <br />
<br />
“They are helpless.” Ty continued. “Their most sensitive parts – all on display. Undefended, except by the most uncoordinated of kicks. They can’t see, grab or fulfill any of their own needs.” Gabriel got knocked off balance by a thigh and found his face full of a dude’s junk, the ballsack plugging his nose, his eye staring at a dark asshole between two muscular cheeks. By the skin tone, he knew it was Jamal’s. He heard a muffled moan from inside the mass.<br />
<br />
He turned to look back at Ty. Ty grinned, “And now for your part in this…”</p>
