<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, you awoke and went through your normal routine. Today, however, you dressed a little better than normal, putting on tight blue jeans and black t-shirt with a new Italian leather jacket, loafers, and belt to top off the look. You also modified your general irresistibility to 50%, making everyone want to be nice and helpful to you. You had re-written your history last night to be the most well-liked guy in school. To everyone else, it was a mystery why your girlfriend left you, but you knew the real reason and had left that the same.<br />
<br />
Jason, her new boyfriend, was the richest kid in town. He had been trying to get Emily from you since you started dating her. You believed it was due to some vendetta he had against you for winning the race for class president against him. Emily was fickle enough that she eventually gave into his bribes and left you. Before, you were content enough with not having such a disloyal girlfriend anymore and had happily let her go, but now that you had this power you decided some justice was in order. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long to find them at school. Jason always made a point of making out with her when you were around, and your locker was right across the hall from his. You just watched the petty display with a visible grin, knowing it would piss him off and that you would soon have your revenge.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, it was time for gym, a class which you happened to share with Jason. You scanned your enemy into the Chronivac and slowed down time for him. He thought he was getting ready normally, but everyone else had left before he&#39;d even finished removing his school clothes. When you brought him back to normal time, you were already naked, waiting next to him. You also increased your irresistibility for him to 100%, making him completely obedient to you, no matter how he felt inside. As he came out of his time slump, he noticed the sudden absence of anyone else and looked around in confusion, only to find you standing there, nude and extremely close.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck, man!&quot; he yelped in surprise, jumping back from you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stay where you are,&quot; you commanded him. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know why, but he felt compelled to listen, despite being seriously uncomfortable about being naked with the guy he&#39;d stolen his girlfriend from. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t move a muscle,&quot; you ordered, stepping up behind him and caressing his arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-what are y-you doing?!&quot; he squealed, unable to force himself to get away. He was trapped by his own body, unable to stop his harassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; you tell him seductively before nibbling his ear. <br />
<br />
Jason couldn&#39;t make anymore noise, even though all he wanted to do was scream. He thought he was paralyzed with fear and hated himself for not punching you, not knowing that he had no choice. You feel him up, examining his body. He&#39;s about as average as you used to be, although his package was much less impressive than your old one. Figures he would be compensating for that. His short brown hair was soft as a kitten, and you smirked as you looked into his amber eyes filled with fear. He was kind of cute, except for the cocky grin he usually had, but this was gone now, replaced by worry about what you would do to him. You returned to his backside, cupping his buttocks in your strong hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Jason. This is really happening,&quot; you whisper, making him gasp as you spread his cheeks. &quot;You took my girlfriend, so now you get to replace her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first push made it up to your glans, and you forced yourself to stay in, allowing his body to adjust to you. You pulled back after a moment and slammed yourself in again, pushing further this time. You continued to inch your way into him, each time going farther inside and eliciting muffled yelps from him, since he still wouldn&#39;t talk. When you felt he was ready, you used your new strength to lift him up, his weight forcing your entire member inside of him up to your balls. He couldn&#39;t stop himself from moaning loudly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you liked that,&quot; you tell him, &quot;because we&#39;re going to move our little party to the stalls.&quot;<br />
<br />
You walked slowly over to the bathroom stalls around the corner, each step forcing him back onto the shaft his body was trying to push out. You force him into the larger handicap stall and lock the door behind you. As you bend him over the toilet, you hear the locker room door open, as you had anticipated, and the sound of the coach&#39;s voice echoed in the tiled space.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pollock! What&#39;s taking so long?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell him you&#39;re fine, Jason,&quot; you command.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Coach!&quot; he hears himself exclaiming beyond his better judgement. &quot;I really had to use the bathroom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry up! And have you seen Lorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Jason, you haven&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Coach!&quot;<br />
<br />
The door slammed shut again and you could feel Jason&#39;s resistance falter and fade as he was thoroughly confused why he had listened to you and not cried for help. His tension eased, he was now much easier to enter. You use this to your advantage to confuse him more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me you like this, Jason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this!&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe he was saying that!<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me you want me inside of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you inside of me!&quot; This was insane!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now tell me you love me, Jason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Jack!&quot; This couldn&#39;t be real!<br />
<br />
As you fucked him, you accessed the Chronivac and cranked his sensitivity to the max while doing the same for your longevity. Just poking him would become orgasmic, and you were currently using him as a cock holster. As soon as you applied the changes, he began squirming in pleasure, panting like a dog, and sweating heavily. His own member sprang to attention and soon became red from the blood rushing to it. You had barely reached around him to stroke him when he unleashed his load into the toilet. Again and again you emptied him until he was breathing so heavily you thought his lungs would collapse. Finally, you came inside him, shooting your massive brew of hot spunk into his gut. As he tried to recover from this act, panting and gasping for breath, you activated a preset in your Chronivac you had created last night. Now it was time to begin the real plan.<br />
<br />
You felt the now familiar tingle of the Chronivac&#39;s changes wash over you as you held Jason&#39;s body tightly, still embedded inside him. You could feel your cock expanding within his gut, melding into his intestine. Your chest also began to cling to Jason&#39;s back, your skin merging together with his. Jason seemed to realize something was going on and you could feel him squirm with terror, but he was still unable to move from his current position leaning over the toilet with his arms propping the two of you up and his legs splayed to allow you access to him. You extended your arms to grab his wrists and wrapped your legs around his, basically piggybacking him now. All the while, your bodies continued to merge together, your mass slowly melting into and adding to Jason&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Curious, you move your hand down to Jason&#39;s crotch, taking his arm with you. You began to stroke his shaft with his hand and were amazed to find you could feel both hand and member as if they were your own. Jason&#39;s sensitivity was still at 100% and the combined feeling of jacking off with someone else&#39;s body and the merging itself set the two of you off, exploding cum into the toilet again.<br />
<br />
By the end of your orgasm, you were able to control Jason&#39;s entire body and forced him to close and sit on the toilet seat. Your own body was halfway merged into his, your limbs were already conjoined but your torsos still looked like one person on top of another. Your head was still slightly back and to the left, but moving further forward every second. <br />
<br />
&quot;This feels good, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; you whisper in his ear. &quot;We are becoming one, and soon you will have never existed. You&#39;ll just be a part of me. Now give in, and let me take control!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that you pushed your face into the back of his head and your transformation accelerated. Your body snapped into his and both of you blacked out. The Chronivac continued on, completing the program you had set last night. You would become a combined being made up of the best parts of yourself and Jason. Your body would be mostly yours, since your first change had made you so attractive and fit, but his organs and yours would merge to become extraordinarily healthy. What little muscle mass he had would also be added to yours, making you even more toned and ripped. You kept your face, but your hair changed from blonde to Jason&#39;s brown and one of your eyes remained Jason&#39;s amber, while the other changed to your blue. Your mind expanded as Jason&#39;s knowledge and memories were added to yours. Mentally, you became 60% Jack and 40% Jason, keeping only the best parts of each of your personalities. You were no longer Jack or Jason, but a completely new person: Jackson. <br />
<br />
Reality warped to accommodate the new you and Jack&#39;s parents became as rich as Jason&#39;s while Jason&#39;s disappeared. While they were wealthy, Jackson&#39;s parents were more down-to-Earth and had instilled the same values in their son that Jack had. He wasn&#39;t as arrogant or petty as Jason had been, but he wasn&#39;t as boring as Jack had been. He kept Jason&#39;s talents and hobbies like swimming, fencing, and martial arts. He also kept Jack&#39;s list of fetishes and love of lewdness. You were both the richest kid in school and the most-liked.<br />
<br />
But, of course, this wasn&#39;t a vanilla merger; Jack had added some fun to your transformation as well.  His previous nine-inch member emerged from your crotch next to Jason&#39;s smaller one which then grew to match. The same happened for your testicles, leaving you with four large nuts in your sack. You had been born with both heterochromia and diphallia, making you a very interesting specimen. Your bisexuality only added to your unique life, and the Chronivac which was fused with your brain gave you limitless opportunities to explore your new life.<br />
<br />
When you awoke, your initial feeling was bliss, left over from the orgasm and transformation you had just experienced. Then reality set in and you rushed out of the stall to see yourself in the mirror of the bathroom. Damn, you were sexy! You also didn&#39;t hesitate to fondle your huge twin cocks, eager to try them out but saving that for later. Your mind was awash with thoughts which were mostly those of Jack, but some of which were Jason&#39;s—no...they were all your thoughts now. There was no Jack, there was no Jason, there was only you. While you could remember both of their lives before the change, you also remembered your own past as your current form. Your parents and friends, your struggle through puberty with two penises, and your current struggle with being a complete pervert before the Chronivac had been sent to you—<br />
<br />
The Chronivac! You accessed the machine and scanned yourself, both fascinated and familiar with the stats which appeared in your mind&#39;s eye.<br />

As you try to take all of this in and remember the plan Jack had created for you, you hear the locker room door slam open and the coach&#39;s voice calling out just as it had before the change: &quot;Pritzker! What&#39;s taking so long?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Coach! I really had to use the bathroom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry up!&quot;<br />
<br />
You rushed to your locker (which happened to be Jack&#39;s old locker) and grabbed what had been Jason&#39;s old phone. Sure enough, the time had gone back to what it had been before the change. Throwing on Jason&#39;s more lavish gym clothes, you leave the locker room excited for your new life and eager for your next move.</p>
