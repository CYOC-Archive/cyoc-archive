<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was no way of knowing how much time had passed. You had been counting every second that ticked by in your humid, putrid, living nightmare, but after a point you had lost track of the minutes, and now you simply waited. You languished in your misery and waited for the tiger genie to return. You waited for the dog you were stuck in to expel you. You waited for this torment to end. Yet nothing happened. It felt like hours had passed and still nothing happened. There was no sign or word from the genie. Your canine jailer had yet to stir from its slumber while you seemed to barely move along its GI tract. To the best of your knowledge, you were not yet at the poodle&#39;s rectum but instead further back where the colon curves away into the dog&#39;s depths. Fortunately, you stopped short of that bend, granting you a view of the exit. Even if it was out of reach. The air within the colon was hot, moist, and thick. You no longer had a nose or lungs, but you could still &quot;smell&quot; in a sense, and the stench that permeated the confines of the dog&#39;s bowel was the most offensively heinous stink that you have ever experienced. A familiar pressure built up behind the obstruction you formed in the dog&#39;s bowels. Like so many times before in the evening, the fleshly tube you occupied shook and rumbled as warm gas rushed past you, forcing through the small gaps and spaces between the wet, vascular walls of flesh and your thick mushy form. You shuddered in disgust and a small point of light opened up ahead as a low thunder sounded in the distance, only it was not thunder. The dog had just farted. Again. <br />
<br />
Dim light filtered into your environment, briefly illuminating the interior of the dog&#39;s colon before the far off anus winked closed and your fetid world was cast in darkness once more. The brief glance of the outside revealed the sky was still black as pitch, meaning that your stay within the pooch was going to drag on for much longer. As you bemoaned the situation, the genie&#39;s words came back to mind. He had mentioned that there was a 24 hour window between your next wish. That meant that you would not be granted another wish until the coming even! You would have to wait for the remainder of the night, the following day, until that night before another wish could be bestowed upon you. That realization killed what morale you had left. You would remain as a dog&#39;s fat turd for an entire day! Speaking of which, there was no way that you would remain within this poodle for that whole time. Likely, come morning the poodle would wake up and promptly squeeze you out as a tightly coiled mound on a patch of grass somewhere before moving on without a second thought.<br />
<br />
You had no idea where you were, besides the obvious being a canine&#39;s lower bowel, but beyond that, you had no way of knowing where you would be inevitably deposited once you reemerged into the world beyond that anus up ahead. You wanted more than anything to be released from this reeking, revolting hell, but the more you thought about it, the more the fear of the unknown caused you to reconsider, How would the genie find you? Was it even possible for him to be able to find you? What if you could not be reached and had to remain as sentient dog shit? These thoughts and more raced through your mind as you cried alone in the dark, hoping for a miracle.<br />
<br />
Time continued to drag on. The monotony was driving you insane! In all this time, you had hardly moved from your previous location from the back of the colon. The unrelenting heat of the dog&#39;s bowels sapped the very energy from you. You felt so tire tired, yet unconsciousness never came. Despite being in the worst place imaginable, you would welcome sleep if only to spare you a moment of suffering. Instead, you were forced to be ever present and aware of your plight. In the all encompassing dark you were alone. Coated in intestinal fluids, the gross sounds of the poodle&#39;s digestive tract served as the soundtrack for your journey through its colon. Your surroundings constantly trembled and gurgled as the sleeping dog continued to pass gas into the night. The poodle&#39;s anus still was so far away, or so it seemed. You have been gradually been pushed along towards that opening, that portal to another realm, but there was still so much distance between you and it. It was as if the dog you dwelled within was an infinite void, like an inescapable black hole. The irony was not lost on you. In many ways, that anus was just that. <br />
<br />
Hot gas pushed past you as the poodle farted around you yet again. You could practically see the fumes as they barreled ahead and flew through that puckered opening. Each view of the outside filled you with a sense of longing. A desire for freedom. But also a Sense of humiliation at what you had become. A reminder of how insignificant you now were. You envied the dog&#39;s flatus and wished that you could be released just as easily. How long has it been already? Another bout of flatulence rumbled down that fleshy tube. Once again, the anus opened. You had been here so long that the world outside this poodle&#39;s ass began to look strange, so alien. You hated to admit it, but you were starting acclimate to your living conditions. The once overpowering stench and heat were not pleasant by any stretch, but they were becoming increasingly more tolerable. The anus closed again, before opening once more and more gas was expelled into the cool air of the night. You felt so small now. In reality, you could not be that far in the dog, but right now that twitching anus in the distance may as well be a portal to another world.<br />
<br />
 In the time you have been here, you had become increasingly aware of the poodle&#39;s colon and the effect it had on your soft form. Over time, you grew steadily in size as you and the other contents of the dog&#39;s digestive tract were compacted together. Various browns melded together and there was no way to tell where you ended and the true dog poop began. You felt uncomfortably swollen as your form pressed into the intestines, actually bulging out the fleshy mucus-slicked tube as they kneaded said mucus into your putrid form. Making you ever more manageable. Come morning, this dog was going to take one monster of a dump. As you slowly inched along towards the still distant exit, moved along by the large intestine&#39;s peristalsis, you could feel the trace moisture being drawn from you, but it was more than that. It was as though you could feel tiny bits of yourself leeching away, absorbed into the intestinal lining before abruptly fading from existence. Everything beyond that went numb. whatever passed through the intestinal walls was no longer yours, but the dog&#39;s.<br />
<br />
There was a sense of floating as you felt an all too familiar pressure bear down on you. The colon shook as the sleeping poodle fart for the one thousandth time that night. Just then, you began to feel faint. This feeling was accompanied by a sense of detached weightlessness, a floating around within the confines of the poodle&#39;s colon with no control over your movements. Then a bizarre tugging on your fluid, nebulous form. You were soon drawn helplessly forward, unable to fight back or even move as you rushed towards a familiar blinding light off in the distance. Then nothing. <br />
<br />
You opened your eyes only to be met with blackness. Were you still inside the poodle? Taking stock of your other senses, you immediately recognized that muggy, rotten smell in the air. What just happened? Were you just...? You tried to get your bearings. Where were you? Far ahead, you saw more light as the anus opened once again, followed by the unspeakable sight of a massive turd! The shit you just were! This confirmed your suspicion that somehow you were still in the depths of the dog&#39;s colon, but how, and why? You were just expelled! That is what happened, right? Your confusion only deepened as you were suddenly jerked forward again by that unseen force, building and building in speed until you pushed past the shit that was also you, the fart you now ride upon loudly vibrating the glistening pink walls around you, as you were propelled out of that gaped turd cutter. You suddenly had a few precious moments of actual sight: you saw a grassy field. Park grounds lit up by the moon? An ad you drifted on the wind you looked behind you, you saw the gateway to the bowels you have been dwelling within - only from the outside. Beyond that, the comparatively gigantic hindquarters of a dog! A black poodle, to be exact, dwindling from sight as you flew away from it. A sharp eye caught a quick glimpse of the unmistakable sight of a furry vulva, just under a raised, poofy black tail. For some odd reason, you found yourself somewhat elated to discover that the sweltering canine bowels you have been broiling with in all night were that of a female&#39;s. And then, before you could fully process what had just happened further, you blacked out.<br />
---<br />
You opened your eyes to yet more blackness. The oppressive smell of the inside of the poodle&#39;s colon was back. This you knew. But you couldn&#39;t wrap your head around this newest development. At this point, you figured that fate must surely be torturing you on purpose, but you had no way to communicate with her to beg forgiveness or demand that she stop. All you could do was wait for the next time you were blasted out of the dog&#39;s anus, only to return here. Again and again.<br />
---<br />
You were frightened! Just what was going on? Was the genie&#39;s magic failing? He said that his powers were limited beyond the zoo. Perhaps whatever magic that transformed you into this dog&#39;s shit was corrupted somehow by the distance? One thing is for sure. Something was wrong. You felt as though you still were that shit, but not at the same time. It felt as though your soul was tearing into three pieces. The dog shit you still were. Mostly, for which you were not sure whether to be grateful or sad. There was that weird feeling just before this, the feeling of being sapped and drained of life by the bowels themselves. You were losing yourself to this dog! Part of you was being claimed by the poodle herself, slowly sponged up bit by bit. Just how much of your essence had been absorbed already? Then there was what just happened. The weightlessness. Somehow your soul was unbinding from your current form and...blending with the poodle&#39;s intestinal gas, only to be farted into oblivion! You feared that by the end of the 24 hours there would not be anything left of yourself for the genie to restore.</p>
