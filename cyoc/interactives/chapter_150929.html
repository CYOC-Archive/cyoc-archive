<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Craig had a very troubled life.  He had been sexually abused by a family member as a child, which had profoundly impacted his mental health.  Ever since that time, he had been unable to make healthy relationships with anyone, especially with potential boyfriends.<br />
<br />
Craig came out to his religious family when he was 19.  They didn&#39;t take it well, to say the least.  They didn&#39;t disown him,l but they actively ignored that part of his life and, if anything, they sought to help him &quot;overcome&quot; it by offering to help him find a nice woman to settle down with.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Craig wasn&#39;t interested in that so he set out on his own with no one to rely on.  He found a place to live and worked full time at a fast food restaurant, which unfortunately caused him to become very obese.<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, Craig was not an attractive person.  He was balding, his nose was crooked and sharp, his skin was blotchy and pale.  He essentially had nothing going for him, which is why he was now in his mid 30&#39;s and hadn&#39;t had sex in almost 10 years.<br />
<br />
Craig became bitter about his circumstances.  He was trapped in this life of ugliness and loneliness.<br />
<br />
One night, Craig was riding the bus after working a 12 hour shift.  Lately he had been having suicidal thoughts, thinking about the least painful way he could do himself in.  He tried to go through his meager health benefits for some therapy, but they would only cover 50% of the cost and only to a maximum of $500.  The cheapest therapy he could find was over $100, so at the most he could only get covered for 4 sessions and he would still be out like $75 each time, which he couldn&#39;t afford on his salary.<br />
<br />
Craig could only afford to leave beyond the end of the line of public transit, and at this time of night he was usually alone on the bus for the last few stops.  <br />
<br />
Tonight, however, Craig noticed there was another passenger sitting right across from him.  Craig was so lost in his thoughts that he hadn&#39;t even noticed this guy get on the bus let alone sit right in front of him.<br />
<br />
Craig almost gasped when he looked up to check the guy out.  The man sitting across from him was the most gorgeous person he had ever seen in his life!  He looked like Chris Evans, only if someone had photoshopped him to be completely perfect.  He was wearing a plain t-shirt and jeans, but they were practically painted onto his muscular body.  Craig was astounded by the outline of a long cock snaking down the leg of the hunk&#39;s pants.  Craig was pretty sure he had never seen a cock that large, and it looked like it wasn&#39;t even hard.<br />
<br />
Craig heard the man clear his throat.  Craig&#39;s cheeks immediately started to burn from embarrassment at having been caught staring at the studs huge bulge.  He looked up at the man&#39;s face, astounded at the perfection staring right back at him.  He had piercing blue eyes that were looking directly into his own eyes.<br />
<br />
Craig was waiting for the stud to speak, but he just continued to stare at Craig intensely.  After a full minute of awkward silence, Craig decided to say something.<br />
<br />
Craig opened his mouth to speak, but found that he was suddenly paralyzed.  He tried to move his arms, then his legs, even his head and was completely immobilized.  He started to panic, his mind racing with fear.  Was he having some kind of stroke?<br />
<br />
&quot;What is your wish?&quot; the hunk asked in a smooth, deep baritone as he continued to stare into Craig&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Craig didn&#39;t understand.  He tried to ask questions, but he was still unable to move or speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t speak,&quot; the man said confidently, &quot;just make your wish and it will be granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig felt an unnatural calm settle over him.  Suddenly, he understood what the man wanted.  He was offering Craig the opportunity to change his life!  He could actually grant Craig&#39;s wish!<br />
<br />
Craig wanted to wish to have the man as his boyfriend forever, but he felt a resistance to that thought.  Almost as if the hunk wasn&#39;t willing to grant it.  Instead, Craig started to wish that he himself could look exactly like the hunk did, but Craig also felt a resistance to that wish.<br />
<br />
Craig started to grow frustrated.  What kind of wish was this, where the rules were completely lost to him?<br />
<br />
He heard the stud speak again, &quot;what do you wish your life to be?  What is it you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig suddenly felt his lips begin to move and he heard his voice, but he didn&#39;t really know what he was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that I could easily find men to fuck and to suck my dick and I wish that the only thing I ever had to worry about was having mind blowing sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile spread across the man&#39;s face and he laughed loudly.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he said gleefully, &quot;that is an excellent wish!  I know just how to make that happen for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man stood up and moved towards Craig&#39;s frozen body.  For a brief, glorious moment the hunk&#39;s massive bulge was only inches away from Craig&#39;s face.  So close that he could see the veins running along the shaft pulsing.<br />
<br />
The man leaned down and planted a long kiss on Craig&#39;s lips.  It was the first time in years Craig had been kissed, and it was by far the most intense kiss he had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
Without any warning, the hunk vanished into thin air and Craig was suddenly able to move again.  He leapt to his feet and swing his head around wildly trying to find the hunk.  Instead, all he saw was an empty bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;End of the line, hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig turned to the bus driver, who was staring at him like he was crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the last stop, you&#39;ll have to leave the bus&quot; the bus driver said with a bit of fear and concern in her voice.<br />
<br />
Craig grabbed his things and made his way off the bus.  The bus driver asked if he was ok, but she clearly didn&#39;t really care.  Craig just stumbled out into the street and made his way towards his apartment.<br />
<br />
The whole walk home, Craig kept reliving the strange experience over and over.  Was it all a dream?  Had he just fallen asleep on the bus and imagined the whole thing?  It was so real!  In fact, Craig could practically still taste the hunk&#39;s lips on his own.<br />
<br />
Finally he made his way into his apartment and into his bedroom.  Craig turned on all the lights in his room and stood in front of the full length mirror, checking for any changes.  <br />
<br />
As far as he could tell, nothing about him had changed.  He was still a fat, frumpy, pale, ugly loser.  He leaned forward to see if maybe his pupils were dialated or something.  Maybe he had inhaled something that got him high.<br />
<br />
Nope, everything was exactly the same.  It must have been a dream.<br />
<br />
Craig suddenly had the urge to strip naked.  It was an incredibly odd sensation.  His clothes just started to itch and he was depserate to shed all of his clothing.<br />
<br />
He was alone in his own shitty apartment, so what did it matter whether or not he was naked?  He peeled off his work clothes that reeked of sweat and grease.  First his shirt, then his pants.  He was left staring at his unsightly body in nothing but his tightly whities.  He leaned down and yanked them to his ankles.<br />
<br />
There he was, strangely hypnotized by his naked body.  Normally he hated looking at himself naked, but right now he was fascinated will all of the different aspects of his body.<br />
<br />
First he noticed just how hairy he was.  His chest and stomach were fairly hairy and it spread over pretty much his entire body, shoulders, arms, back and ass.  The only place his hair was thinning was his head.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, all of his body hair just fell to the floor.  Aside from the hair on his head, he was now completely smooth.  Craig thought that he should panic, but somehow he was completely calm.  He just reached up and ran his hand along his smooth chest, his fat belly and down to his soft little 2 inch cock and grape sized balls.  Not a single hair.<br />
<br />
Next, Craig noticed all of the tiny imperfections on his skin.  Freckles, moles, some skin tags, discolorations and scars.  His skin looked like a topographic map of a mountain range.<br />
<br />
Again, Craig watched in amazement as an incredible change happened.  All of the tiny imperfections just vanished from his skin.  His skin was now completely smooth, hair and blemish free. Again, he ran his hands across his body and his skin felt like a newborn baby!<br />
<br />
Still completely calm, despite the drastic and rapid changes, Craig&#39;s eyes started to roam about his body.  He was checking out just how flabby he was.  He was tall, over 6 feet, but he was definitely beyond obese.  Last he had checked, he weighed in at about 315 pounds.  His gut stuck out in front of his body and hung down obscenely, practically hiding his tiny cock.  His arms were flabby, his man boobs hung down and sagged over the side of his body.  Even his face was fat, with a large double chin and no has line to speak of.<br />
<br />
Craig&#39;s heart skipped a beat as he watched his body slowly shrink, as the fat on his body started to melt away.  Hot tears of joy started to stream down Craig&#39;s face.  Of all his negative qualities, Craig had always hated how fat he was.  He thought that, if only he was slimmer he would at least be able find someone as ugly as he was that would let Craig fuck him.  Now, that was finally going to change.<br />
<br />
Craig watched in amazement as his fat literally disolved from his body.  His skin seemed to be shrinking too, which was a huge relief.  Craig watched as his body fat percentage dropped lower and lower.  He had done his research on body fat percentages and, as the changes slowed and came to an end, Craig guessed that he was now certainly less than 10%.  In less than two minutes, Craig must have lost almost 200 pounds.<br />
<br />
Craig stared in awe at his new, slender frame.  His upper body was rather slim, but he could see each contour of his with muscles.  He looked like an ugly teenage skater or swimmer!<br />
<br />
His lower body, on the other hand, was much beefier.  He had always wondered if his lower body would be rather muscular from carrying around his fat ass 24/7.  In fact, his legs looked like they belonged on a weight lifted.  His butt was nice and round, his thighs were almost as large as his chest and his calves were like perfect diamonds.<br />
<br />
Craig sensed that the changes had stopped for a moment, so he took the opportunity to admire the current state of his body.  He looked a bit like a weird cartoon, with a wiry and slender frame sitting atop a powerful, muscular set of legs.<br />
<br />
He lifted his arms above his head and struck a classic flexing pose.  His arms were very taught, but we&#39;re very slender.  Craig did very little lifting, aside from lifting food to his fat greasy face, so he wasn&#39;t really surprised by that.  His chest was completely flat and he could see his ribs when he flexed, his skin taught and smooth.  He didn&#39;t really have any abs, either, but his belly was perfectly flat and he had the hardest outline of where abs could possibly appear.  Craig wondered if, when the changes resumed, he would have a powerful muscular top to match his powerful legs.<br />
<br />
He glanced down had his legs and, twisting his heel so his foot was perpendicular to the mirror, he pressed his toes into the floor, lifted his heel and flexed his entire leg.  The muscles were quite impressive!  Craig could see the veins sticking out from beneath his smooth, perfect skin.<br />
<br />
Craig unflexed his leg and glanced at his tiny, two inch cocklett and his small, hairless balls.  He admitted that his little cock looked bigger now that he had almost no fat on his body, but it was still a tiny cock.  But Craig suddenly felt that was now going to change.</p>
