<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lance left the zen garden where the council was having its emergency meeting; needing a quiet place devoid of shouting and other noises so he can make his phone calls. Lance enters what looks like a library in Tachibana’s estate. Thinking it will suit his needs; the were-panther who wasn’t in his fusona sat down in a chair and started calling his various contacts. First calling Ella to let her know that he decided to have her Crawford expose farmed out to other newspapers and media outlets.<br />
<br />
Lance screamed on the inside of wanting to inform Ella as to the reason why he was doing this; yet since this was an emergency session, a war council to be more precise; Lance had to keep his reasons vague and cryptic. He did however let Ella know that the wer-panther was making another attempt at Benton Knight; informing Ella that Jack Crawford was trying to attack the trust fund set up for Benton’s only daughter. It was an awkward call for Lance to make; but he was thankful that Ella was okay with her article heading to other newspaper. Breathing a sigh of relief; Lance proceeds to call up the editors he knew of in Seattle and New York and started to make the moves in ensuring Jack Crawford and his wife became pariahs in their respective social circles.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
It was few hours after Benton received a call from Daisuke; letting the were-panther know of Jack and Kenya Crawford’s flagrant snubbing of the council and their overt threat to the were-communities the world over. Benton was sitting in the kitchen still in his fursona; stewing as he drank coffee. The coffee being decaffeinated as Amanda was not keen on her husband spending the entire night wired and unhinged. Benton watched his wife stare at him as he muddle through what Daisuke told him earlier; pausing only briefly to hear Frieda upstairs still on her skype chat with Eric and Spencer.<br />
<br />
“Our daughter has been on her Skype for almost forty five minutes now,” Benton feeling emotionally exhausted; “what is it she needs to talk about that they haven’t already discussed?”<br />
“Just leave it be Benton,” Amanda shaking her head; “let our daughter have her quiet moment before bed alright?”<br />
“I just don’t want her blabbing what I talked to her earlier,” Benton sighing; “with what has happened lately, I’m feeling like I can’t say anything in confidence without three other people knowing.”<br />
“Jack Crawford will regret bugging your Therapists office,” Amanda placing her hands on Benton’s large furry paws; “just take a back seat on the situation. Let the council deal with Crawford.”<br />
“Would if I could,” Benton giving off a low grumble; “the council wouldn’t know how to deal with him.”<br />
And you do?” Amanda looking at her husband questioningly; “you have be fighting him for years and have yet to come out of it the victor.”<br />
“A war is not won on a single victory,” Benton responding; “it takes many battles to bring your enemy to his knees.”<br />
“Well it seems,” Amanda letting go of Benton’s paws; “Jack Crawford has been getting the better of you of late.”<br />
“That is because I have been distracted,” Benton getting up to refill his coffee mug; “with the building of the new elementary school, my therapy and spending more time with Frieda…”<br />
“Oh no you don’t” Amanda looking stern; “you don’t get to use our daughter as an excuse to not being on your game. So try again.”<br />
<br />
Before Benton could respond, his phone vibrates along the kitchen island; letting him know he has a call.<br />
“It’s your brother,” Amanda looking at the caller I.D; “let’s just ignore him tonight.”<br />
“No,” Benton grabbing his phone with his paw; “this is probably important. Lance,” Benton accepting the call; “has the council decided how they are going to deal with Crawford?”<br />
“How the hell do you know,” Lance trying to respond but being interrupted<br />
“Daisuke called me earlier,” Benton answers; “so I know what Jack Crawford did.”<br />
“Okay,” Lance speaking; “that saves me from having to give you some bad news.”<br />
“You have more bad news,” Amanda speaking; letting Lance know that she is present and can hear the conversation.<br />
“Yes Amanda,” Lance groaning; “but do what you can to keep your husband flying off the handle. I am just messenger after all.”<br />
“Then say what you have to say,” Benton starting to growl.<br />
<br />
“First things first,” Lance speaking; “while the council is at loggerheads as to dealing with Jack Crawford, I have already put forward a motion that will in part cripple him and possibly hobble whatever plans he has in the works. You Know of the expose my paper is about to print for tomorrow’s edition?”<br />
“You mean that delicious little story I can’t wait to read,” Benton smiling for the first time since coming home.<br />
“The same,” lance responding; “I’m having it published in several papers in Seattle. Making sure that Jack Crawford’s friends see it and start distancing themselves from him. I’ve also got the Wall Street Journal and other business minded newspapers keen on the article,” Lance speaking.<br />
“Oh I like that,” Benton chuckling; “it will piss him off as he tries to do damage control.”<br />
“A slight problem though,” Lance interrupting his brother’s joy; “Jack Crawford let slip to the major news networks regarding Frederick Parker’s arrest. Our town is currently besieged with nosey reporters wanting to find out how a mobster from San Francisco ended up in jail hear in Moon Lake.”<br />
“Bumping your story to the back pages,” Benton grumbles; “so what else do you have to tell me?”<br />
“You better sit down for this one,” Lance clearly sighing; “you know those papers for Frieda’s trust? The ones you had me file when I had to head into Seattle last month?”<br />
“What of them,” Benton gritting his teeth; “you didn’t lose them did you?”<br />
“No,” Lance reassuring Benton; “those documents are back in my safe after they were properly notarized. Yet,” Lance pausing for the moment; “Jack Crawford found out you transferred ownership of Crawford Computers to Frieda. The council has a reliable source that Jack is trying to steal that part of Frieda’s trust right out from under her.”<br />
<br />
“OVER MY DEAD BODY,” Benton roaring in rage.<br />
“Benton calm down,” Amanda stunned at how quickly her husband was quick to anger.<br />
“I will not calm down,” Benton growling; “it’s one thing to go after me. That I expect and respect to a degree;” Benton seething. “But to attack my daughter,” Benton throwing his coffee cup and watching it shatter as it hit the fridge door; denting the door in the process. “That I will not forgive,” Benton growling; teeth bared and his claws out.<br />
“Think Benton think,” Amanda trying to calm the angry were-panther down; “what does Jack need to do in order to steal Frieda’s trust fund.”<br />
“He needs a fucking miracle,” Benton growling.<br />
“Amanda,” Lance speaking through the phone; “what Jack Crawford needs and this is the beauty of Frieda’s trust is both your signature and mine as well as our thumb prints.”<br />
“And he isn’t getting either,” Benton looking about the kitchen for something else to throw or destroy.<br />
“Why our signatures,” Amanda asking; “why not Benton’s?”<br />
“Because mine can be forged easily,” Benton growling; “or better yet photo shopped from one of the many memos, directives or other documents I have signed as head or Knight Industries. That is why.”<br />
“And the thumb prints are a standard safety measure,” Lance speaking up; “to defeat Crawford’s attempt to forge any document transferring control of Frieda’s trust.”<br />
“And when Crawford realizes this,” Amanda now holding onto Benton’s phone; “what then?”<br />
“Unless he is willing to use force to get our thumb prints and signatures,” Lance speaking; “then…”<br />
“He is fucked,” Benton finishing; “even that idiot wouldn’t stoop to violence to get what he wants.”<br />
“Are you sure about that,” Lance responding; “because Jack Crawford had two men attack Nate Anderson a few hours ago. It’s part of the reason why he and Kenya fled town so fast.”<br />
“Eric’s older brother,” Benton sounding confused; “what for?”<br />
“It had to do with a breakup between Nate and Kenya going bad,” Lance answering; “at least that is what Tachibana stated earlier. Sheriff Cooper tried to get Jack sent back here after getting pulled over by the state troopers, but Jack’ s Lawyer was real slick from what I heard.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Amanda answering as she looks at her husband; “Benton and you can talk more about this tomorrow. Hanging up on you now.”<br />
Benton looks at his wife as she put down his phone before getting up off the stool she was on.<br />
“After what was just said,” Amanda getting ready to leave the kitchen; “you can forget on arguing me about not getting guard dogs for the estate. You know where the broom and dust pan is,” Amanda looking at her husband; “you can clean up the mess you made with throwing your coffee mug.”</p>
