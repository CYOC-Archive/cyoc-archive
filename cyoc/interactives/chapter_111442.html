<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep.  It must be the morning, she could feel light basking her skin through the window.  She opened her eyes to see her mom shaking her by the shoulders, and looking very cross.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer Smith!  What the hell were you thinking?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!?&quot;  Jen looked down at her naked body, and her naked formerly-Julie girl/penis body resting between her legs.  Her penis body&#39;s head was resting right next to her exposed sex, and one of her penis&#39; hands was inside her penis&#39; pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are in big trouble young lady!&quot;  Her mom crossed her arms, and glared down at Jen.  Jen&#39;s second brain in her penis slowly woke up as the brain in her original head tried to process what was going on.  She moved her penis body away from her crotch, to the side of her bed, embarrassed to have been caught in a position that showed she had been having sex with herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;d I do?&quot; Jen mumbled and tried to wipe the sleep from her eyes.  Secretly she was proud of herself for speaking with only 1 mouth - Even after her pleasure session the night before, she still didn&#39;t feel very confident of her recently extended body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting girls at school pregnant!?  Breaking the rule about having sex with yourself!  Probably getting yourself pregnant!&quot; Mom shouted at Jen.  &quot;Jen, I raised you to be better than that!  I even let you name your penis and pretend it was your sister while you were growing up.  Yes it was weird and a little worrying at times, but it was better than letting you have only imaginary friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that you&#39;re finally making real friends at school, you go and get a bunch of girls pregnant!?  Why the hell haven&#39;t you been taking the impotency pills Dr. Moretz prescribed!?  The school said they were okay accommodating your disability, but only if you didn&#39;t significantly impact the lives of other students.  And then you go and get a bunch of them pregnant!  Are you TRYING to get kicked out of school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Young lady, if you get kicked out of school, then you&#39;re going to have to find somewhere else to live.  You can only live under my roof if you&#39;re going to be a productive member of society.  AND you better be taking your impotency pills.  I&#39;m going to count them whenever I feel like it, and if you&#39;re off even by 1, then out you go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The principal called this morning.  You&#39;re suspended until those girls you got pregnant can get their lives back in order.  If you&#39;re still suspended after 30 days, then you&#39;re expelled... From both school and MY home.  You&#39;re on your own cleaning up this mess.  Deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mom stormed out and slammed the door behind her, leaving a stunned Jen alone with herself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jen buried her original body&#39;s face into her pillow, and started to sob.  Simultaneously, she covered her penis body&#39;s face with its hands and cried loudly.<br />
<br />
<i>Just when I thought I was getting my life back under control, it falls apart again.  All because of that stupid curse!  I wish I&#39;d never been cursed.</i><br />
<br />
She cried for almost an hour before calming down.  When she did, she discovered that what she had been crying out of her penis body&#39;s eyes were not tears, but semen.  Her entire penis body, most of her original body, the indestructible umbilical cord connecting her bodies, and most of her bed were covered in dried or drying semen.<br />
<br />
Frustrated and defeated, she walked her penis body into the bathroom and started a hot shower while her original body gathered up the bedsheets and shoved them into a dirty clothes hamper.  Then her original body joined her penis body in the bathroom.  When she walked in the door with her original body, it was the first time she had really looked at her penis body since it became 100% her.<br />
<br />
She stopped and posed her penis body a few different ways to see just how she looked.  Despite being coated in dried semen, her penis body was very sexy - No wonder all the girls at school wanted to have sex with it.  And her penis&#39; brain couldn&#39;t help but observe that her original body was also very sexy.<br />
<br />
Observing her selves quickly aroused Jen, triggering the breasts on her penis body to begin to slowly inflate.  &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;m in enough trouble already...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen embraced her selves, hugging her bodies together and kissing herself on the lips.  The touch of her lips, the press of her breasts upon the other body&#39;s breasts, the heat of her pussies being so close yet not touching served only to arouse her further.  With one hand from each body she groped the other body&#39;s ass, and with the other hand she fingered the other body&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
Separate but similar pleasure built up in both of her bodies, quickly filling her minds with sheer pleasure.  She pushed herself to climax in both pussies, quickly achieving 2 simultaneous orgasms.  The two brains in her two bodies served only to further amplify the pleasure she felt.  Her unbroken kiss suddenly took a different turn as her dual orgasms caused her penis body to come.  Semen spouted out of her penis body&#39;s mouth directly into her original body&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed by the feeling of 3 simultaneous orgasms, Jen instinctively swallowed her own semen.  She came three more times before the orgasms faded.  Each time, she took and swallowed her own semen instinctively, not entirely aware of what she was doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
As the pleasure started to fade, Jen broke her self embrace and moved her bodies away from each other.  She rested her penis body against the door to the shower, and her original body against the wall next to the sink.  As her breathing slowed, she became aware of the surprisingly good taste and stickyness in her mouths.  She recognized it in her penis&#39;s mouth - it was a sensation she experienced every time Julie had sex... Back when Julie was a different person and not just a name she made up for her penis.<br />
<br />
<i>Did I just... jizz in my own mouth?  Holy crap.  That was actually kind of amazing.  And tasty..</i><br />
<br />
Smiling at herself, her penis body entered the shower and started to clean off.  As she did, she noticed a bottle of pills on the sink.  Picking them up, she read the label: &quot;Virility Suppressors, for extreme sexual hyperfunctions only.  Take once daily, per mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remembering her mother&#39;s warning, Jen shook 2 pills out of the bottle, and took and swallowed 1.  She carried the other pill into the shower, and had her penis&#39; mouth swallow it.  She grabbed a loofa with one body, and used it to scrub down the other body, then swapped.<br />
<br />
<i>I think I&#39;m really getting the hang of this 2 bodies thing.  It&#39;s a lot more fun than I thought it would be.  The curse has still ruined my life, but at least I get amazing bodies.</i><br />
<br />
Giving in to her rising arousal, Jen pressed her bodies together again and started to make out.  This time she refrained from going for an orgasm, just wanting enough to bat down her arousal.  As she kissed herself, her minds wandered even further,<br />
<br />
<i>I bet the curse would let me do all kinds of kinky and weird stuff.  I bet it could even make someone pregnant.  Or... not pregnant any more!  I can fix my life with the curse!</i><br />
<br />
She hopped out of the shower, dried her selves off, and rushed her original body to her closet to get dressed.<br />
<br />
<i>Julie didn&#39;t wear clothes, so I don&#39;t need to wear any clothes on my penis body.  This is me now... I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be changing much any time soon, time to get used to it.  Besides, I&#39;ve always kind of wanted to be able to go about naked.</i><br />
<br />
Now clothed only on her original body, Jen left the house and went to...</p>
