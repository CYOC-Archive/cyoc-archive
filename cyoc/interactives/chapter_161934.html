<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Second part. Still very new to writing. Hope you get to know more about Ambrose and how he will deal with his ordeal in the later chapters.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    Ambrose couldn’t believe it. Before his very eyes, the light was turning itself into a golden Minotaur! <br />
    He stared in awe at the mighty creature. He has read about this beast. The Minotaur was the offspring of the Cretan Bull and Queen Pasiphae, the wife of King Minos. It was doomed to live out its life in Daedalus’ labyrinth.<br />
   But the Minotaur of legend wasn’t in the labyrinth anymore. It was standing right in front of Ambrose’s eyes, standing at an astounding 7 feet. The beast was filled to the brim with raw strength and power. It had the mighty head of a bull, complete with its curving mighty horns. A scar ran across one eye of the beast, as if someone or something had scratched it a hundred years ago. And its eyes, oh its eyes were mighty indeed. Piercely staring at the young and vulnerable 17 year old. <br />
    Ambrose’s gaze moved down to the Minotaur’s mighty chest, which heaved up and down with each breath the beast took. With bulging pectorals that no bodybuilder could beat, and with abdominal muscles to match. The Minotaur’s figure stood mightily; its body was in a shape of a triangle. Its shoulders were wide and strong, with strong and bulging back muscles. The Minotaur possessed mighty arms, with biceps as big as watermelons and forearms so strong it looked like it could lift a 1000 pound man. Its hands were mighty and rough and strong, and they looked like they could strangle Ambrose right there and then. The fingers ended with hoof like fingernails that surrounded each tip.<br />
   Ambrose’s eyes moved towards the Minotaur’s lower body; which of course were the hind legs of a bull. His thigh muscles looked strong enough to run for days at a very high speed. And instead of feet, there were hooves of course. The Minotaur’s crotch area was covered by a thick mound of fur, covering its genitalia. And as Ambrose attempted to look behind, he saw the beast’s tail swaying back and forth in the wind. <br />
   The Minotaur didn’t say anything. It just stared deep into Ambrose’s eyes. Ambrose was confused of whether he should be at awe at the creature he for so long wished to meet in person, or if he should be screaming for help because of the fact that he was trapped, naked, in the dark woods, standing in front of a Minotaur that could easily kill him with a mere squeeze of its fist.<br />
    But before Ambrose could think up of anything else, the light that surrounded him started to force his mouth open. He couldn’t fight it back, it was as if his mouth had a mind of its own.<br />
   Suddenly, the golden glowing Minotaur walked closer towards Ambrose. It had a menacing look on its bullish face. Ambrose realized that though the Minotaur had the muzzle and head of a bull, he could still see that the Minotaur was able to convey expressions, just like a human being and unlike a normal everyday blank staring bull.<br />
   Solemnly, the Minotaur slowly lifted his one mighty hand, and before Ambrose could react, as soon as the Minotaur’s hand entered his mouth, the beast’s form dissipated. The golden light immediately flowed inside Ambrose’s mouth. It was as if Ambrose was drinking the light, if that would make any sense.<br />
    And as the light entered his body, Ambrose felt secure. The light provided him with a sense of warmth and giddiness. For a moment, he didn’t worry about his stepfather and how miserable he made life for him and his little brother. Ambrose felt like he could take on his father in a fight, and with confidence he thought of kicking him out of their home. Ambrose, with a newfound surge of strength and confidence from the light that entered him, felt like he could take on the world and protect it  from anything that wished to destroy it.<br />
   The last of the light entered Ambrose’s body, and in a flash it was dark again, and Ambrose fell to the ground, cold and naked. He coughed for a bit, and took a deep breath since he was not able to breath during the ordeal. <br />
   Ambrose could not believe at what just happened to him. Was it really all real, or just a dream? He stood up, and pinched himself. He winced from the pain. Yep, he wasn’t dreaming.<br />
   Ambrose turned around. He was confused of what to do next. Where should he go? Should he go home naked? What will he say to his little brother? His little brother, Andrew. He’ll believe anything Ambrose will tell him.  He thought up of an excuse to say to his stepfather. <br />
   As Ambrose started to make his way out of the woods, a sudden pang of pain erupted in his abdomen. He clutched his stomach. Something was there. It was as if a rock was slowly growing and bulging inside. He winced in pain as he fell to his knees. He watched his quivering hands. They were growing and bulging, with new found veins that pumped blood to his muscles. His fingernails started to darken and harden, and the surrounded his thickening fingers. Ambrose thought these hands looked familiar. And then a sudden discomfort formed on top of his rear, which itself was growing and bulging with new muscles. Ambrose reached for his behind, and he felt a tail starting to form.<br />
   Ambrose realized that he was turning into the Minotaur that he saw enter his body just a while ago! <br />
    He suddenly panicked, not knowing what to do next. He tried to stand and make a run for if, but a sudden pain in his foot caught him off guard. He fell to the ground on his face, and as he looked behind to see what the pain was, he gasped as he saw his foot molding itseld into hooves. Bull hooves.<br />
   As Ambrose scrambled to get up once again, his legs started to rearrange itself into a bull’s hind legs. His thighs erupted, powerful enough to carry the mass of his soon-to-be upper body. Ambrose watched as his skin started turning into a leathery hide, like that of a bull. Small furs started sprouting everywhere, including his face. <br />
   He attempted to stand up, but instead he banged himself against a tree as his hears started to migrate at the top of his head. His shoulders bulged forth, stretching and growing to match those of the Minotaur that he met earlier. His arms grew as his hands pushed against the tree in pain. His biceps inflated to the size of watermelons, and his forearms grew thick and strong. His back muscles grew in size too, with widening trapezoids. And at the front, his chest expanded in size. His pectorals started to bulge, and the pain that he felt earlier materialized itself as Ambrose witnessed his abdominals hardening. A thick mound of fur grew in where his private parts where, which were very proportionate to the size and musculatare of his new body.<br />
   Last but not the least, Ambrose let out a bovine bellow as his neck muscles grew and as his face stretched out into a muzzle. From his forehead, mighty horns erupted beside his now flappy and very bovine ears. Ambrose bellowed in his now deep and baritone Minotaur voice, and he passed out on the ground of the cold and very dark woods. <br />
   Before Ambrose completely lost consciousness, a voice echoed from inside his head. The voice sounded just like his new baritone voice, only it sounded mightier yet reassuring, as if it was a very honorable voice.<br />
   “You are now the new guardian of this land. Guard it well.”<br />
   Ambrose passed out, now the new and mighty Minotaur Guardian.</p>
