<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Trying to get it to a point that leads to more tfs. So just add what you want. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Glancing over to the side for bit. Josh’s eyes went wide. “Crap! Dinner must be ready!”<br />
<br />
“Oh well I already had my fill.” Crystal teased him as she poked his breast balls and rubbed her belly.<br />
<br />
Josh looked away and blushed. “Yeah…. But do are you...going to stay for dinner?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Crystal smiled. “I am going to be staying with you master.” She kissed his lips deeply. She slowly broke her kiss. “I do not want to leave you honey.”<br />
<br />
“I doubt it.” Josh slowly blushed with a soft smile. “But we won’t have anything for you to eat.”<br />
<br />
“Well you fed me.”<br />
<br />
“True.” Josh laughed before he started to get dressed. “But-”<br />
<br />
“Hey Josh? Crystal, mom told me to tell you two lover birds that dinner is ready.” Josh’s sister called through the door.<br />
<br />
“Alright. We’ll done very soon.” Josh called over to his sister as he slipped on his underwear. <br />
<br />
“Just don’t take too long or the food will get cold.” She called to them before she walked away.<br />
<br />
Josh just stayed quiet as his underwear slapped on over his breast balls with a loud snap. This caused his milk to slosh around while he slipped on his pants.<br />
<br />
After just a few more minutes he got on all his clothes on. He stretched for a second before he started to walk out his door with Crystal close behind him.<br />
<br />
The two lovers talked as they walked down to the dinning room for dinner. During the dinner, many topics came up. One was if Crystal was hungry which she said all she wanted was a drink as she ate too much before. Another was about how good the meal tasted with Josh’s milk.<br />
<br />
That made him blush and his sister just teased him that he enjoys it as much as they do. Mostly trying to get a response out of him as Josh was never comfortable with the idea. But Josh did tease her about not being able to find a boyfriend with breast balls like him.<br />
<br />
After a little while dinner finished up and his parents was cleaning up dinner. His sister went away to take care of something. But the young couple left the table and started to head down to the basement where the entertainment room was.<br />
<br />
“So why are you naked?” Josh asked his wife as the two walked side by side in the house. <br />
<br />
The milkpire drider shrugged, “It’s how I am. I don’t’ want to hide my body from my darling.” She ran her fingers over her master/husband’s chin. “But you know. I think you should perhaps make your dick more <strong><em>fun</em></strong>.~”<br />
<br />
“Fun?” Blushed Josh.<br />
<br />
“Yes fun. I thought of something fun.” She cooed. “I always wonder what it would be like to be screwed by a breast.”<br />
<br />
That made Josh stop as they walked down stairs into the diner room. He blushed and stuttered. “Wait… like a breast… for a penis?!”<br />
<br />
“But of course!~” Crystal kissed his cheeks. “Master.~” She cooed as she stroked his breast balls to stir the milk. <br />
<br />
“But I do not have the book.” Josh said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
“Then let me get it.” Crystal smiled as the got into the giant open game room. There was a flat screen TV, tons of gaming consoles, XBOX One, Playstation, Switch. Even a VR area, pool table and darts.<br />
<br />
“Fine.” Josh sighed as he shook his head and sat on a couch. “Can you get it for me?”<br />
<br />
“Be right back Master.” She giggled as she left the room. After a few minutes she returned with the book and handed it to her lover. She then stood up against the back of the couch right behind Josh. She then sat down and rested her head on his right shoulder. “Here it is. Can you do it for me?~” She asked right into his ear. “I want to see you with a really mega breast dick!~”<br />
<br />
“Fine but I want to learn about a few more things about this world I got dragged into. And I want to do one more thing to you.”<br />
<br />
“I am going to stay a milkpire drider.” Crystal reminded him.<br />
<br />
Nodding, Josh opened the book. “I know. You will stay the same…. Mostly. Stick a milkpire and a drider.”<br />
<br />
“Good.~ But before we talk more.~ I want you to have a breast cock!~”<br />
<br />
He sighed. His wife, was quite the woman. Taking a pen that his wife gave him. He started to write.<br />
<br />
<em>Josh has a 5ft round breast cock. A breast that doubled as a dick. It still have milk just like his breast balls but just like his breast ball milk, his breast dick milk can make a woman pregnant <strong>only</strong> when he fucks them. His nipple would be huge and puffy, about 2ft round.</em><br />
<br />
He put down the pen and watched the words glow gold for a second before turning black. He dropped the book to his side as a huge fire grew in his cock. Biting his lip, he watched and felt his rod get hard. Making a tent form in his pants.<br />
<br />
The familiar filling of milk started to pour into his dick as it started to round out into a sphere. It rapidly filled out with milk and with breast fat that replaced the fat and flesh of his rod. Leaning back into the couch be moaned right into Crystal’s ear.<br />
<br />
She starred down that newly forming breast, her eyes sparkled at the sight of the cloth stretching along with his breast cock.<br />
<br />
The cap of his dick flattened out and turned round, quickly turning into a nipple. It pushed out against the fabric to force it to perfectly form to the nipple. Just in a few more seconds the breast grew well past the 1ft mark. Gasping hard, he blushed as the feeling of more milk filled the boob cock. It’s cold touch tickled his entire boob penis while it started to rapidly grow. Opening just one eye, Josh watched as his breast dick past 3ft round. Easily pushed him back into the couch.<br />
 <br />
“Wo-ow—” Josh blushed as the breast rapidly grew and inflate. In just a few seconds it finally reached it’s final size. That firm organ loomed there right before the two.<br />
<br />
“Happy now?” Josh gasped as he got pinned by his own dick tit.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes I am.” Crystal giggled as she reached past his shoulders and grabbed his breast cock. He stroked his dick with her hands. Letting her fingers brush over that special breast dick. Her eyes were completely drawn to it. “This makes you look so much sexier!~” She hummed.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Blushed Josh as he felt her kneading his boob cock. “But…” He trailed off and moaned a bit. “Now you need to explain about the Vampire Hunters.” He ordered.<br />
<br />
“Of course, master.” The milkpire nodded. “Where to begin.” She then muttered.</p>
