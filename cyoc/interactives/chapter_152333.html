<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upon completion of this most dirty of deeds, Jeff got the same contempt for donkeys and the idea of being one, that he always would get upon finishing himself. But instead of being happy he&#39;s human and not a donkey and moving very quickly onto the rest of his life by doing something only humans can do; such as peeing in a toilet, showering immediately after, playing video games or sleeping in a bed; Jeff was the very thing he held in such contempt! <br />
<br />
When he pulled out of this stranger of a female donkey, he came to realize the position he was in. No hands. Stuck to always walking on all fours. Long ears. Completely covered in a gray furry pelt with white fur underneath covering his belly, and around his giant black nostrils. Big, slightly rotting yellow-black teeth: almost green. Stuck in HIS mouth. <br />
<br />
He inevitably fell to all fours when he backed off her rump, his contempt for donkeys coming to the forefront of his brain. Instead of being overjoyed at still being human, he can only wish he was. With hands. Inside his bedroom back home, which he would never see again. The image of his lowly, dirty body came rushing into his mind. The nasty, fishey aftersex of himself and that....that ...female DONKEY he just wittingly had sex with....a member of the species now made just for him to be mating with; a strong fishy odor came to his sensitive nose.<br />
<br />
Feeling utter disgust and humiliation at how his body just betrayed him, his long, thick, dark penis retreated back into its home underneath him and between his back hoof-ending legs. <br />
<br />
She looked back at him, as she swung her large female body around. She started angrily braying at him! He backed up a couple of steps, tried speaking and instead, brayed himself in response! She stomped a hoof and bit at the air at him. Almost as if she were pissed that he was still in her presence.<br />
<br />
Donkeys don&#39;t have the same level of love as humans. When they get together to mate, they immediately part ways. A done deal. The female goes on to have her new baby donkey, and the male moves on to find another to fuck. And this particular female was quickly reaching middle-age herself. Having birthed several times in her short lifespan of ten years; each to a different male donkey on this farm. She was a dirty slut of the donkey world. A middle-aged slut that acts and tries to look like a sexy woman half her age, and utterly failing at doing so. Just a dirty old whore of a donkey. And that&#39;s who Jeff just had sex with; just filled her with his own thick, mid-aged yellowish donkey batter!<br />
<br />
She became increasingly agitated. Jeff, unable to know what it was she was angry about, sort of backed up. She then reared up on her hind legs, and came down with a dual &quot;clomp!&quot; on the ground. <br />
<br />
Getting the picture and feeling the fool, hoping none of the other donkeys in the farmyard saw him retreat, dominated, he turned and walked away. As a male donkey is supposed to do. Only he walked away as a middle-aged male donkey. Not as a 13 year old human. <br />
<br />
With horror, he saw other donkeys looking at him. Braying, almost with laughter! He felt the same way he would feel if he were human and being laughed at by other humans. A human wouldn&#39;t give a thought about what donkeys thought about them. I mean, who cares, right? They&#39;re just dumb lowly draft animals anyway, right? Slaves to humans. Ordinarily, Jeff, like all other humans, wouldn&#39;t give a thought to a group of donkeys braying at them. If anything, humans would hold such a group in lowly contempt. <br />
<br />
But not donkified Jeff! Since he is now the same species as them in body, he found himself mentally invested in what a group of others of his species thinks of him! <br />
<br />
Humiliated, rejected, stuck, trapped, Jeff just wanted to speak! &quot;Eerrgghh Hhhaaww!!&quot; To just say one word that would rightfully separate him from them in a superior way! But no. That&#39;s now impossible. &quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
He wanted his fingers back! To just spread them and use them to take a hot shower and clean himself! &quot;Eeerrgghhh hhhaawww!!!&quot; The only &quot;language&quot; he is ever capable of voicing! He SOOOO wanted his hands! He wanted his computer games! He felt utter contempt for his own kind, while at the same time, embarrassed and shy around others of his kind. Like an awkward new kid at school hoping to be able to fit in. <br />
<br />
He was at the top of his class among humans at school! He was a popular kid, well-liked by everyone! Including the less popular ones! Instead, now he&#39;s the new, awkward donkey on a farm in god-knows-where! Wishing he could fit in, shamefully aware of such a ridiculous wish! Unable to shake such a desire! <br />
<br />
Then he hears footsteps. He sees the vague blurry shape of that girl coming towards him, with a large dark shadowy figure following behind. He quickly picked up on the scent, and somehow instantly knew what it was:<br />
<br />
A large....VERY large....alpha male draft horse! Where Jeff was &quot;only&quot; 750 lbs...yes, &quot;ONLY!,&quot;...this beast was 1800! Weighing nearly a ton! <br />
<br />
Whereas, Jeff was a &quot;short&quot; very plump, fat 750 lbs, this beast was a lean, muscle-bound, gorgeous 1800 lbs of perfect horse flesh! Jeff was instantly awed and jealous. He cowered like a stereotypical unpopular ugly fat nerdy kid when being approached by the beautiful star quarterback of the football team. The two don&#39;t even belong in the same realm! <br />
<br />
Realizing how he was instinctively feeling; that he was actually socially awkward, shy, and afraid of another lowly beast like he now he was, his shame increased even further! He slowly backed away, head down. Not wanting to meet this horse&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
But her and that horse slowly approached him. He backed up into the side of the open-air barn. A portion that was underneath the roof that had the watering trough separate this patio-like part of the barn from the main stables inside. <br />
<br />
Jeff became &quot;trapped&quot; inside this feeding/watering area. The girl came up with the horse in tow with a bit and bridle in hand. She grabbed Jeff by the head. He swung his hard, heavy head out of her grasp. Then she slapped him! And yelled at him in her strangely familiar language! Again, almost making out the words, but not quite. It was almost as if he was looking at a shimmering figure, not quite able to make out what it is. His brain just could not penetrate the fog of this crazy language barrier he set for the chronivac! <br />
<br />
He knew she was speaking English. She had to have been! Now he is regretting the decision to not be able to understand spoken words by humans. He cannot respond to any commands. He could never show his intelligence! His mind was forever trapped with no ability to ever communicate with another being! Nobody ever aware such an intelligence rested within the ordinary skull of a donkey!<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh Hhhaaww!&quot; He managed out of frustration. As soon as he opened his mouth to bray, she quickly and skillfully shoved a bit into his mouth! The now-familiar, tight, uncomfortable feeling of a the sharp, tangy flavor of a metal bar shoved behind his large slabby back teeth!<br />
<br />
He immediately wanted to spit it out, but that would be now impossible for him to do so. Only a human can now remove it! <br />
<br />
She latched the rest of the leather strap around his head, and tied reins to the bridle. She then took a big wooden collar with two holes, and fitted Jeff with the smaller, left hole around his neck.<br />
<br />
Obeying her commands, which an unintelligent natural-born horse had a better grasp of spoken English than Jeff&#39;s altered human brain will ever have, the big scary black horse swung his large frame around to the right side of Jeff, and turned around to face the same direction as him.<br />
<br />
Feeling extremely intimidated, he tried moving away. But the instrument he had placed in his mouth and tied to leather strappings, gave the small 115 lb petite girl the leverage and uncomfortable bit she needed over the 750 ld donkified Jeff. She forced him to stay next to her obedient horse.<br />
<br />
She grabbed the wooden collar that was now attached to his neck, and attached the other side with the larger hole to the neck of the horse! He was now even more trapped! He began to struggle, wanting now more than ever to have use of his old hands, but the collar served to choke him unless he stood in a very specific direction and location. Jeff was forced to stand still. Struggling mightily with what he did to himself merely....one day ago? He had lost track of time and didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s been a single day or multiple days! Was it the 4th of July now!? He wanted to go home to his parents and go on that picnic they had planned.<br />
<br />
Curious about what day it was, he started asking the girl:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhaawww....eerrrgghhh....HHHHHAAAAWWWW!!!&quot; Quickly realizing he cannot speak! That last &quot;HHAAAWW!!!&quot; being his attempt to say &quot;FUUUUCK!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she broke his thoughts and put a big black blinder on his left cheek, over his left eye! He now cannot see to his left! He can only look straight ahead or to his right. But all he sees to his right, is that big scary horse! <br />
<br />
All the sudden, the horse started walking and Jeff was forced to go along. He wanted to break to his left, but he&#39;s stuck next to this horse! The girl periodically and rythmically using a whip on his side, mostly painlessly, and whipping the reigns along his back. <br />
<br />
That whip ALWAYS found the exact same location. It was much less painful, than it was just simply irritating. But the repetition of it all was mind-numbing<br />
<br />
The horse slowly gained more and more dominance over poor Jefferey&#39;s human mind. They were endlessly walking in circles around a dirt track in a small, fenced-in portion of the property. Jeff constantly feeling the very slight sting of the whip. It all started becoming dull to Jeff, as he was forced to walk in circles for hours while being lightly whipped.. Unable to ever see to his left. Only able to ever look forward at the same blurry black and white images of the barn, the fence, the trees, the fields, and back around to the barn again. The feeling of his phamtom hands slowly becoming numb. Losing definition in his mind. Until all he is able to ever &quot;feel&quot; are his large, blocky, useless donkey hooves. His feet and toes already long-gone in his mind.<br />
<br />
Over the course of his lifetime, he would completely forget what its like to have human hands. His brain trying to wrap around how humans are able to manipulate so many appendages at once. Forgetting that toes were even a thing. Much like a human wondering how and what it would be like to manipulate a tail. His hooves always looming large and heavy in his mind, always knowing he once had such strange digits as &quot;fingers,&quot; and somehow doing all sorts of great things with them.<br />
<br />
But for the time being, he was descending into the idea he has hooves. His fingers slowly disintigrating in his mind. Following the way of his feet and toes hours ago.<br />
<br />
He has no idea how long he is forced to walk in this circle. His mind in a deep trance. Seeing the barn. The fence. The trees. The fields. And back to the barn again. Then the fence, trees, fields. Barn, fence, trees, fields. Over and over again. And to his right, the ever-presence of his large, black trainer. <br />
<br />
&quot;My trainer!?&quot; Jeff&#39;s mind momentarily breaks from it&#39;s trance-like reverie.<br />
<br />
He tried to move left, but is forced to stay in his same path. The girl whipping his side even sharper than before. &quot;HHAAWW!&quot; he yelled in surprise. And so, they kept moving. His mind dullfully focusing on the task at hand. Then not even focusing at all. He fell into a complete trance the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
All the sudden, they stopped. Then they started to walk again, back towards the barn&#39;s patio. They went outside the small fenced-in circle they just spent countless hours in, and into the barnyard before the feeding/watering patio. <br />
<br />
FINALLY, the girl released them both from the collar! But Jeff almost felt....empty without it. <br />
<br />
His trainer moved forward to begin feeding on the fresh pile of hay inside the feeding patio thing. Jeff started following, but his trainer looked back, glared at him, and unintelligently neighed. The girl also pulled his reigns with his used, metallic bit still in his mouth! He was hungry! And thirsty! But he was blocked by his trainer, and being held fast by his owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;My owner!?&quot; Thought the logical-thinking human part of his brain. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I have to wait until he&#39;s done eating first,&quot; thought the subdued Jeff, being jealous and wishing that he was that horse instead. Now, Jeff is thinking in terms of a horse being a superior being, and humans being impossibly superior yet. How far he has fallen! And has yet more to fall still.<br />
<br />
It took a while for the black beauty to finish. Jeff started moving forward again towards the sustenance. And again, she pulled back on his reigns! Was she going to let him starve to death!?<br />
<br />
Then a couple of large male donkeys came up and took the horse&#39;s place. They finished. Then came the pregnant females! Human Jeff was never sexist, but all male donkeys are. Including donkified Jeff:<br />
<br />
&quot;Even the GIRLS get to eat before me!?&quot; realizing he just called a bunch of strange female donkeys &quot;the girls,&quot; like he would do in a human classroom full of familiar human faces. Familiarity of the human race slowly being removed from his mind.<br />
<br />
He suddenly thought of his parents! What they might be up to right now! But he was forgetting the faces of his parents. Becoming blank manikin heads in his mind. He hadn&#39;t been able to actually &quot;see&quot; them all that well when they last came home to discover their donkified son in their yard. Last time he physically looked at their faces as a well-sighted human kid, was a couple of days before they left! Which was....how long ago again...?<br />
<br />
Regardless, Donkeys dont recognize human faces. And apparently, neither can Jeff. He is forced to not recognize them any longer, due to his setting the machine to not be able to receive any communication cues from humans. He is truly isolated in the world of  the donkey species with his human brain, quickly becoming dominated and learning his lowly place with the shameful, aweful body he has. <br />
<br />
The pregnant females fished eating, then came two older donkeys, and a couple of very young ones. Jeff had to even wait until THEY were done! So he&#39;s now not just a human, not a horse, not an alpha male donkey, not even on the same footing as females, the old, and the young donkeys! He&#39;s at the VERY bottom of the chain! He has fallen far indeed!<br />
<br />
His minds-eye quickly looks over his body from a human perspective. What he saw, was an ashamed, depressed, lonely old donkey with its tail between it legs, it&#39;s large obnoxious ears bent slightly back, and huge wobbly balls between it&#39;s legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is me now,&quot; he sadly sighed internally. Unable to cry. &quot;This is my life now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, even those lowliest of donkeys finished eating and he was able to move forward to gobble up whatever sad, drool-filled leftovers were left. Much of it had dropped out of the mouths of other sloppy and greedu donkeys that was half-chewed. He could smell the stench of the mouths of a lot of other donkeys all over this hay. The only food suitable for his new station in life.<br />
<br />
He sniffed at the slimy leftovers. Disgusted with what was left. Even though his own mouth was probably worse off than the others&#39;, he couldn&#39;t stomach the thought of having multiple other donkeys&#39; slimy mouth drippings inside his own sickening mouth. Forever being forced to &quot;suck&quot; on the slimy tongue of a donkey. His tongue!<br />
<br />
His appetite now diminished, he thought he would at least drink some water. Again, his station in life would force him to drink from a trough. A used trough! That would turn out to be more smelly slime than water. He couldn&#39;t stomache that, either. The girl said something, took the bit out of his mouth, then walked away. <br />
<br />
She went into the barn to stable all the other animals. Each stall with a bale of fresh hay. Jeff had no such stall. He was left to his own devices in the barnyard.<br />
<br />
Free at last, he wandered away from the barn. Very sad and depressed. He wandered out into the grass-covered field. At least out here, it smelled nice and fresh, except for a random pile of crushed manure or two scattered about.<br />
<br />
Jeff stopped somewhere in the middle of the field, with the sun setting. Alone. He was finally alone! He thought about the day&#39;s events. He had been humiliated in more ways than one. And had it really only been a single day? Will all the days following be much like today was? <br />
<br />
He was pretty sure it was now the fourth of July. He could hear the distant booms of firecrackers bursting somewhere off in the distance at some unknown place. He thought about two days ago, with plans to see eat good picnic food. Hotdogs, hamburgers. Plans to see the fireworks, and plans to eat a funnel cake. <br />
<br />
Speaking of food, he was starving! His sense of smell and his donkey instincts kicked in. He was strongly tempted to dip his head and eat the fresh grass. But the thought of the smooshed piles of manure, and the trampling of other hooves from other donkeys, as well as the random pissing from other animals partially stopped him. The thought of dipping his head down to eat grass directly from the ground, without even the use of hands, made him fully stop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Grazing.&quot; That&#39;s the word they use for animals who slowly walk around a lawn, eating the grasses. He is alone, with the strange, dirty body of a donkey, contemplating on how his kind are forced to eat. The mental image of him grazing in this field shot into his mind. He looked like any old ordinary donkey, except for being overweight. Looking at himself with his chronivac-induced photographic memory, he could not make himself out from other donkeys. They all looked the same, and he looked exactly like them! No indication of his intelligence present. That&#39;s how he&#39;ll always forever look from the outside to all humans! <br />
<br />
Hunger ended up getting the better of him. He lowered his broad gray snout to the ground. His large black lips parted, and his big slabby vegetarian equine-stlye, yellow-stained teeth pulled at the grass for the first time.<br />
<br />
Pulling it into his mouth with his big slimy vile donkey tongue, he started automatically chewing from side-to-side like an ordinary donkey would.<br />
<br />
The grass tasted sweet and fresh on his tongue. What did he need funnel cakes for, anyway? This was entity suitable!<br />
<br />
With his mind going &quot;blank&quot; in a trance-like state, he spent the next couple of hours mindlessly grazing. Not realizing he was also ingesting manure-covered and slightly salty pissed-upon grass. He just kept right on mowing the lawn like farm animals do. <br />
<br />
By the time the sun set, Jeff became mentally exhausted, closed his eyes, and fell asleep. Outside. Close to the middle of the field of his unknown new home.</p>
