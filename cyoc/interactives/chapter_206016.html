<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Apologies for taking so long to work on this chapter! Big thanks to rawr7 for helping! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Trevor could shoot Todd, there was a loud pounding on the door. The half-nuki groaned in frustration before turning around and walking to the door. He opened the door, and Todd could see the Kirin from earlier standing there. <br />
 <br />
“What do you want, idiot?” Trevor snarled, pointing a gun at his face.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; The brutish Kirin looked around and blinked. The floor was oddly silent, most of the patrons being ushered to other floors. &quot;Boss, the floor is clearing...I think something&#39;s happening.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Trevor looked behind them and saw the busy floor starting to clear up. His eyes narrowed. <br />
 <br />
“Shit, you two come inside now!” Trevor hissed.<br />
 <br />
Both the stegosaurus and the Kirin entered the bathroom. Todd watched them look at the bear skin rug that used to be Mark and the jockstrap that used to be Xavier.<br />
 <br />
“Now then, it seems we have a predicament,” Trevor said. “It seems like the Dolans are planning something.”<br />
 <br />
“Boss, what do you mean?”<br />
 <br />
“They plan to attack and corner us in this bathroom,” he said, cocking his gun. He turned to Todd and shook his head. <br />
 <br />
“You’re a very lucky fox,” he said. “I want to turn you into something that suits my needs so badly right now, but I need the extra firepower…” As Trevor started to turn around, he stopped and suddenly clutched his head. <br />
 <br />
Todd sighed in relief. By knocking on the door, the Kirin had just bought him a few extra seconds, and those extra seconds were all that he needed for the transformation to wear off. <br />
 <br />
The raccoon in front of him began to change rather quickly. The digits of his paws began to merge, creating an avian-like foot with three toes in the front and one in the back. The nails on each of these new “toes” lengthened and sharpened, becoming razor-sharp talons. The fur on his feet began to recede into his body, being replaced by black scales from his ankles down. <br />
 <br />
Trevor’s gray fur was slowly being replaced by red and gold feathers that blended in a way that reminded Todd of the rising sun. The fur on the raccoon’s tail began to lengthen and split into its sections before turning into large, elegant tail feathers. <br />
 <br />
As the feathers continued to overtake the fur on his body, Trevor’s beer belly disappeared, retreating into his body. His muscles shrank slightly, giving the changing male a well-muscled but gangly build. His fingers began to thicken slightly as his thumb shrank back into his body. As black scales began to grow in, his claws lengthened further, becoming slightly sharper in the process. Large feathers began to grow from his arms, giving his arms the ability to act as wings if needed. <br />
 <br />
As the changes reached his head, Trevor clutched his head in pain as new memories (or in this case, old memories) flooded into his mind. He was so preoccupied with trying to push through the pain that he didn’t notice his muzzle curving and hardening into an orange beak. As the feathers overtook his head, the Phoenix morph let out a loud squawk. <br />
 <br />
When the transformation finally died down, the phoenix began to look around the bathroom with a confused look on his face. <br />
 <br />
“What the hell?” he asked. “What happened? Where the hell am I?” <br />
 <br />
He turned around in time to see Rusty and Rok’s clothes change back into what they were wearing before. Both the Cerberus-morph and the cyclops looked as confused as he did. <br />
 <br />
“What the…? Weren’t we just on the Body floor?” Rusty asked, looking around the bathroom. Upon seeing Troy, all three of his heads let out sighs of relief. “Oh thank God, you’re back to normal. Also, why do I have my fingers up your ass, Todd?” The canine pulled his fingers out, making Todd moan softly. <br />
 <br />
“Back to normal?” Troy asked. “What do you mean? Did something happen?” <br />
 <br />
“Xavier turned you into a corrupt raccoon mob boss,” Todd spoke up, clutching his jaw as he got off the floor. “You turned him into a jockstrap for stealing those decoy rings you made. You then turned Mark into a bear skin rug for calling you an asshole. I managed to buy myself just enough time before you shot me in the head and turned me into…something.” <br />
 <br />
The phoenix morph looked at the jockstrap in disgust and horror. “Oh, God!”<br />
 <br />
“Oh right, I should probably fix that,” Todd said. He pointed at the half-nuki’s discarded jockstrap. “Animate.”  <br />
 <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
 <br />
“You have the Book of Body?!” Rusty shouted as Mark finished transforming back into a fox. “Since when?!” <br />
 <br />
“Not just Body,” Todd said. “I’ve got the entire Book of Transfiguration. I’ve had it for a few weeks now.” <br />
 <br />
“But how’d you even get them?” Rok asked. <br />
 <br />
“In my timeline, you guys went to fight Dolan about a month ago,” the fox explained. “You lost, and Dolan froze you in time, effectively turning you into living statues. Xarxos somehow made it out with the books, however, and he brought them to me. Prime Dolan told me not to tell anyone about what books I had, but I’m not about to listen to that asshole.” <br />
 <br />
“He wanted you to keep it a secret?” Troy asked. “Why would he not want us to know what books you have? It’s not like we can do anything with them.” <br />
 <br />
“Maybe so other guests won’t get any ideas and try to steal the books?” Mark suggested. <br />
 <br />
“I hate to interrupt,” Rok interjected. “But this conversation is better discussed somewhere private when we’re all together. Where’s the Xarxos from your timeline?” <br />
 <br />
“I…I’m not sure…” Todd replied. “The last time I saw him, we were all leaving the magic show to go and explore the casino more. Mark, have you seen him?” <br />
 <br />
“No, I haven’t seen him either,” the white-furred fox said, shaking his head. “Maybe he lost track of time and he’s still exploring the casino?” <br />
 <br />
“It’s possible,” Rok said. “But if he’s anything like our Xarxos, then it’s doubtful.” <br />
 <br />
“We can focus on that later,” Troy said. “Right now, I think we should turn Xavier back to Xarxos.” <br />
 <br />
Xavier’s eyes widened. “H-Hey, come on now!” the stag said, giving the group a nervous smile. “You don’t honestly want that stick in the mud bull back, do you?” <br />
 <br />
“At least that stick in the mud won’t stab us in the back and have his reality shift backfire horribly,” Rusty said. “Now just hand over the ring copies.” <br />
 <br />
The stag sighed in defeat and reached for his left hooflet to take the fake rings off…but they weren’t there. Concerned, Xavier reached into his pockets, frantically feeling around for them. His hand brushed past his cock, which began to plump. By the time he pulled his hands out, his crotch was bulging tightly.<br />
 <br />
Unbeknownst to everyone in the room, the walls of the bathroom began to shift, tile transforming into old wood planks. Overhead, the lighting changed from fluorescent to dangling bare bulbs as the ceiling rose further up. The bare blue and green tiles on the floor flattened and lost color, becoming bare concrete.<br />
 <br />
“Come on, stop wasting time!” Rusty groaned, adjusting his package, which was feeling tight in his dress pants. “Just give us the copies!” <br />
 <br />
“Th-They’re gone…” Xavier said, sounding panicked. <br />
 <br />
“Oh, sure they are,” Mark said, rolling his eyes and shifting uncomfortably in place, his pants squeezing his genitals uncomfortably. “Unf! Just give us the damn rings!”<br />
 <br />
“No, I’m serious!” The stag held up his hooflets before turning his pockets inside out to show that he didn’t have them. No one noticed the threads of his jeans unravel until he stood naked, dark-mottled cock and plump black balls exposed, swelling larger with every second. His shirt began to unravel, threads disappearing as he spoke. “I had them a second ago! They must’ve fallen off when I lost my legs!”<br />
<br />
“Guys, I think he’s telling the truth,” Todd said, his clothing beginning to evaporate, huge horse cock plumping and dangling between his legs. A stream of urine erupted from its tip, splashing on his legs and pooling around his paws. He appeared undisturbed by this change and continued talking. “I don’t see anywhere else he could hide them, and there’s no way he could’ve changed them into something else without one of us seeing him do it or hearing him use a spell.”<br />
<br />
“Fine, we’ll go outside and check,” Troy said, scratching his enormous package and waddling to the door, the increased weight forcing him to hold it to walk normally. “Rusty, don’t take your eyes off of him, okay?” <br />
 <br />
The canine nodded his heads in understanding, moving behind Xavier, whose body was swelling with muscles, as the group walked out of the men’s restroom. However, none of them were prepared for what they saw waiting for them on the other side. <br />
 <br />
Instead of the casino, a wide, dirt-floored arena greeted them. <br />
 <br />
Beyond the open double-door at the far end of the arena was a grassy pasture. They could see horses grazing on a hill in the distance. Behind them, the door shifted to match the double doors at the far end of the area, revealing the bathroom as it finished shifting into a huge stable.<br />
 <br />
“Guys, something’s different,” Troy said, scratching the fur on his growing pec as it shortened and thickened into horsehide. “We’re in the middle of a reality shift.”<br />
 <br />
“What’s changed?” Xavier snorted, tossing his growing mane, not noticing as his muzzle elongated, his eyes bulging and spreading to the side of his face.<br />
 <br />
“The casino’s a barn now?” Todd frowned, his fox tail receding and long coarse hairs blossoming from it. His new horse tail flicked at a fly that landed on his back.<br />
 <br />
They were all nude. Which was, of course, as they always were. Horses didn’t need clothes, after all. That thought troubled Todd. Wait, were they always horses? He whickered in fear, nudging Mark, whose changes had progressed much further than Todd’s.<br />
 <br />
“Ah, looks like my newest racehorses have come!” An anthropomorphic horse walked out of the stables, pitchfork in hand and a piece of hay clenched between his teeth. “Dolan told me ya’ll would be comin’. Name’s Chawhee. How’re my newest studs doin’?”<br />
 <br />
“S-studs? This isn’t-Ungh!” Troy grunted, tail lifting and horse turds tumbling from his puckering black asshole. He shifted on his paws as their nails thickened, going faintly numb, then merged into wide hooves. He teetered, off balance as his legs lengthened, and his hind end grew perfectly round with muscles and fat. His horse cock dangled to the floor and let loose a stream of piss. As the piss slowed to a trickle, he relaxed, relief clear on his face. “Ah, man, that felt good! It’s, um….”<br />
 <br />
“Oh yes, you’ll be making a fine stud horse.” Chawhee grinned and approached Troy, tossing aside the pitchfork and producing a brush from his pocket. “They warned me two of you have enough Books to resist this. I’ll have to help you along.”<br />
 <br />
Todd backed away from the stable hand and Troy, unsure of how to fix this. He knew he must be the other one Chawhee had referred to. He looked around, hoping someone else had managed to shake himself out of the reality shift’s allure. <br />
 <br />
Rusty and Rok were off in one corner, eating hay. Rusty’s heads had merged into a heavy horse head, eyes dulling. Rok was already on all fours, mostly fully formed into a horse. Mark had given in immediately and trotted over to Todd, standing next to him protectively. Perhaps some part of him was still in there, a lingering thought or instinct that told him they were lovers.<br />
 <br />
Feng and Rex had suffered the same fate as Mark had. They pranced out to the pasture. Todd saw their upper lips raised and realized they had scented mares in heat. There was no one left to save them…except, well him.<br />
 <br />
Not for the first time in the evening, Todd wondered where the hell His Xarxos had gone. A Mass Dispel would be extremely useful right about now. He no longer had a phone to text him, it had broken down into its base components and disappeared back into the stables.<br />
 <br />
Troy was backing away awkwardly on heavy hind legs, holding himself off the ground using the arena&#39;s walls. The changes were progressing up his backside, stomach bulging as more organs began to fill it, expanding to fit his new body.<br />
 <br />
“Here, let ole’ Chawhee help you out.” The stable-hand gentle pushed on Troy’s back.<br />
 <br />
“Wait, stop!” Troy scrambled to gain purchase on the wall, but his hands had fully formed into hooves.<br />
 <br />
“Shh, shh, shh, I got you, boy.” The stable hand smiled and noticed a gleam on Troy’s wrist-his Book. “Let me help you adjust.”<br />
 <br />
Troy gave a whinnying cry as the Horse-anthro unclasped the bracelet from his wrist. <br />
 <br />
“There we go, let’s get you down, boy,” Chawhee grinned, tucking the bracelet safely in his pocket and increasing the pressure on Troy’s back.<br />
 <br />
Troy slipped off the wall and fell forward, catching himself on his hooves, the bones in his arms lengthening. He felt a pop in his lower back and a crack in the bones of his waist, and no matter how hard he tried, he simply couldn’t bring himself to fully stand again. <br />
 <br />
The stable hand was at his heaving sides, brushing him, making soothing nonsense sounds.<br />
 <br />
Troy wheezed as his chest barreled out. Each pass of the brush shifted the color of his hide from dull chestnut brown to the glistening midnight black, mane flowing and luscious as Chawhee worked his way from his tail to the base of his mane. It was finishing him up, perfecting him, muscles bulging in the proper places<br />
 <br />
The stable hand moved up to his neck.<br />
 <br />
Troy tried jerking away, but Chawhee was surprisingly strong. He muscled Troy’s head into the proper position and stroked the brush across his neck.<br />
 <br />
“Please, you gotta stop!” Troy protested his neck popping and growing longer, muscles growing as it grew longer and longer. “You gotta-Neirggh!”<br />
 <br />
“Stop? You’re going to be the prettiest Arabian Stallion in the world! Your sperm will cost thousands.” The stable hand smiled, looking into Troy’s eyes as they grew larger. “You’re going to be very happy here.” He said solemnly, no trace of a lie in his voice. “I promise.”<br />
 <br />
Troy stared at the stable hand, eyes wide in terror, as Chawhee started brushing down his forehead. Without his Books, he was helpless. This was the end for him. He could feel his skull beginning to change, his vision moving as his eyes started to relocate to the sides of his head.<br />
 <br />
He flung his head out of the way, ducking the brush and shoving the massive horseman away.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee chuckled, dropped the brush, and lunged. <br />
 <br />
Troy tried to jerk his head back, but the horseman was big and fuckin’ <I>jacked</I>. The stable hand caught him in a headlock. Troy tried to squirm free, but the arm tightened around his neck, squeezing his carotid, and he had to stop or he was going to pass out.<br />
 <br />
“There, there, calm on now,” Chawhee said, then shoved his hooved fingers into Troy’s nostrils.<br />
 <br />
It hurt, and Troy tried backing up, but his big horsey rump bumped into the arena wall and he couldn’t seem to move sideways. Chawhee rotated his fingers and the pain and tightness ebbed away, his nostrils relaxing and flaring. Troy could suddenly smell all the scents in the arena-the other horses, a few mares in heat…<br />
 <br />
Troy’s upper lip lifted nostrils flaring wide as the smell hit him. Chawhee removed his other hand from the soon-to-be stallion&#39;s neck and shoved it in his mouth, his hooflets pinching and rubbing Troy’s teeth. His lips became rubbery and black, little bristles emerging around them. <br />
 <br />
By the time Troy came to his senses, blocking out the smells that had his huge horse-cock swinging out of his sheathe, his whole face was engulfed in a warm and pleasant tingle. He used his bigger tongue to cautiously explore the hand in his mouth. His lips felt thicker, his teeth large and wide.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee noticed awareness returning to the transforming man and removed his hand from Troy’s wide mouth, wrapping his arm back around Troy’s neck. Then he used his other hand, the one whose fingers were still in Troy’s nose, took a moment and splayed his fingers, forcing Troy’s muzzle to grow wider and broader. Then he hooked his thumb behind Troy’s teeth. <br />
 <br />
He pulled.<br />
 <br />
Troy gave a high, strangled whinny as his face stretched forward like taffy. His skull and jaw painlessly altered shape with tiny pops and cracks. His eyes resumed their movement to the side of his head. He could feel his mind begin to simplify, his skills and knowledge fading as his brain shrank and restructured.<br />
 <br />
The growing horse’s struggles grew more violent as he felt his past begin to change. But Chawhee’s grip never wavered. He just pulled at a slow, steady pace. The dome of Troy’s skull began to flatten, the ridges of his brow growing more pronounced.<br />
 <br />
Troy tried to fight the creeping dullness of his thoughts, but Chawhee kept pulling and even his memories of having been changed began to fade. New memories, ones of training under Chawhee, and total obedience replaced them. Troy felt his cock *thump* pleasurably against his belly, scattering what little thoughts he could gather. Being obedient was good. He was a good horse.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee continued stretching the Arabian’s muzzle further and further. He smiled as he watched the large eyes dull, irises doubling in size, leaving very little whites showing. His smile widened into a grin when he heard the tell-tale thumps of horse masturbation.<br />
 <br />
“There you go, boy.” Chawhee encouraged, still stretching out the muzzle. Not much further to go, very little resistance was left as the bones reassembled themselves like a puzzle. He’d intentionally gone slow, letting the obstinate stallion feel it.<br />
 <br />
Troy’s thoughts were in a daze, everything centered on being a good horse, and *thump*<br />
 <br />
Being loyal to his master-*thump*<br />
 <br />
The dome of his skull was almost completely flat now, and the horsey-man was speaking to him, but he didn&#39;t understand his words. <br />
 <br />
He could-*thump*<br />
 <br />
Feel himself getting close-*thump*<br />
 <br />
So pretty-*thump* <br />
 <br />
Good horse-*thump*<br />
 <br />
Troy felt like he should be afraid of losing himself, but all he felt was a pervasive sense of cottony contentment.<br />
 <br />
Lip raised, Troy, let out a whiny and allowed the contentment of being an animal to fill his mind. As his mind gave up, the last of his resistance fading, there was a pop as his skull finished restructuring. It was so pleasant a feeling that he orgasmed, mind blanking out and never returning as his cock began unloading wad after wad of hot stallion cum onto the ground below.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee felt the muzzle reach its full length and the horse’s eyes dull just as its cock erupted, splattering the ground with some very expensive horse seed.<br />
 <br />
“There we go. Good horse!” Chawhee grinned as the stallion nuzzled his hand. “Very good horse!”<br />
 <br />
He wished he’d thought of catching the sperm before it had hit the ground. He had a collector on him, but he had idiotically forgotten it in his excitement at changing someone. He bent down and scooped up the chips that had fallen out of the horse and pocketed them.<br />
 <br />
Todd watched in horror as the beautiful Arabian stallion whickered and nuzzled the stable hands head, tail flicking. He could see his chips as they rolled out of the horse’s ears and landed on the sands below. Chawhee picked them up and stuffed them in his pocket. He gasped, seeing other chips there.<br />
 <br />
His friends were gone, all horses, most trotting out into the pasture to graze. Only Mark stayed at his side, snuffling his hair and lipping him affectionately. Todd absentmindedly reached up and stroked the stallion’s neck for a second before he realized what he was doing and withdrew his hand. Mark didn’t seem to notice, resuming sniffing his boyfriend, not a thought in his feral eyes.<br />
 <br />
“Looks like we’re down to one.” Todd heard Chawhee say and realized his time was up.<br />
 <br />
Todd backed away, bumping into Mark.<br />
 <br />
“It’s okay pretty fella.” Chawhee raised his brush. “You want this or the milker?”<br />
 <br />
“Milker?” Todd asked.<br />
 <br />
“Come here bud.” Chawhee grinned, pulling out a tube from his bag, a long sleeve with a suction pump at the end. “You’re gonna love this.”<br />
 <br />
Todd swallowed, tears rolling down his face, and stepped awkwardly towards the stable hand.<br />
 <br />
“Hey, the horses are the only ones who should have long faces,” Chawhee said softly, hoofed hand reaching up and brushing away Todd’s tears. “I’ll be gentle if you behave, okay? You’ll just slip away with all that cum. Bracelet.”<br />
 <br />
Todd hesitated, but a stern look from Chawhee made him pull it off and hand it to the horseman.<br />
 <br />
“There ya go.” Chawhee smiled gently, stroking Todd’s tear-stained cheek. “You’re gonna be a big, strong Clydesdale. We have a wagon ride through the fields during Halloween and a sleigh ride in the winter with the snow we create. You’ll be pulling it, doesn’t that sound nice? Giving people rides?”<br />
 <br />
Todd found himself leaning into the horseman’s hands and nodding along. It did sound nice. The stable hand reached down and slowly fondled Todd’s genitals. Todd felt himself come erect and with a practiced movement, Chawhee slipped something over it, something that felt a lot like a condom, filled with lube that oozed around the base at it covered his cock completely.<br />
 <br />
“Good boy!” Chawhee praised him, flipping a switch. The sleeve began to suck and vibrate, the little ribs moving, making Todd’s cock twitch with unexpected pleasure. “Such a good, big boy!”<br />
 <br />
Mark had followed him to the stable hand and was now very interested in Todd’s growing flanks. Chawhee noticed the horse’s interest. Todd wanted to say something to him, shoo him off, but the automatic jacker on his cock started into a pre-programmed pattern, making him shudder and a low whinny escapes from his mouth.<br />
 <br />
“Looks like you’ve got yourself a boyfriend, huh?” Chawhee grinned, fingers going to Todd&#39;s ears and tugging them up, easing them into the proper shape. <br />
 <br />
Then, once Todd’s ears were complete, he lowered Todd to the ground. <br />
 <br />
Todd could only watch as he lost feeling in his fingers as his paws turned black, thick keratin building up around them. It felt <I>good</I>, and he lost himself in the pump and suction of the automaker for a moment. When he returned to his senses, he saw that the fur on his wrists had feathered around his ever-enlarging hooves.<br />
 <br />
Strangely, Chawhee was nowhere to be seen. <br />
 <br />
Then he felt his tail being gently moved aside. <br />
 <br />
Three thick-completed digits eased inside Todd’s rear. The ring of muscle pulsed and twitched under Chawhee’s touch, it was reshaped and remolded, thickening and squeezing it into a much larger hole than he’d naturally have. It was tough and leathery, yet soft and flexible, like pleather.<br />
 <br />
The hooflets went deeper, his hole stretching pleasurably as Chawhee stuck his whole hand inside. Todd suddenly felt nauseous and an odd fluttery sensation filled his anus. Suddenly he could feel the insides, there were smooth muscles there, and he could feel something forming deeper inside. The more Chawhee dug, the more sensitive his asshole became, and with the suction of the jacket, he almost came right there.<br />
 <br />
Todd chuffed and stamped his hind hoof in pleasure as he felt his hole become oddly slick, swollen, and sensitive. A strange heat welled up inside him. Chawhee pulled his arm out of the newly formed ass-womb. <br />
 <br />
“It’s okay boy, just making you more receptive to your boyfriend,” Chawhee said from somewhere behind his ever-growing body. “You’ll be working double-duty.”<br />
 <br />
He felt the horseman’s hands move to his cheeks, massaging the muscles with his stiff hooflets. His ass grew thicker and fatter with every tug and squeeze. Todd felt far more sturdy and stable, the massage growing more pleasurable the longer it went on. The fingers left, leaving Todd wanting, his anus winking and dribbling a clear fluid.<br />
 <br />
A finger swiped across his highly sensitive entrance, making Todd shiver.<br />
 <br />
Todd wanted to look and see what was going on, but he couldn’t even crane his neck far enough. He thought he saw the stable hand wave his juice-soaked hand in front of Mark’s nose. It wasn’t until he felt an immense weight settle on his back, forcing his still-growing front half to the ground, that he realized Mark was going to fuck him.<br />
 <br />
The stallion prodded, trying to find Todd’s entrance. Then he felt the tip of the thick, flared horse-cock stretch his new hole and whinnied. The cock began to piston in and out of his slick walls, making Todd clench his new muscles in pleasure. <br />
 <br />
He felt so full, the stallion’s cock shoving itself in deep and hard. It struck his prostate over and over again with each thrust. A steady stream of pre was tucked away in a whirr by the device, slowly filling a collection chamber.<br />
 <br />
Todd was struggling to hold himself back from cumming when he felt hands on his automaker. Chawhee was doing something, fondling his balls. There was a welling heat inside and Todd swore he could feel them swell even larger. <br />
 <br />
Another hand stroked the base of the automaker and shoved it further down. Another inch of cock meat found itself inside the jacket. Todd wondered where it came from, as the device was already firmly sitting at the base of his cock. Chawhee pressed the device further and further down, and Todd shuddered as five whole inches of brand new dick filled the Jacker, widening out until it fit the entire circumference of the machine.<br />
 <br />
The automaker changed its pattern, starting to ripple and pulse. Todd moaned, wondering why he couldn’t cum, though he so badly wanted to. Chawhee walked back around him, rubbing his hands over his chest. It grew wider, barreling out, thick with muscles and fat. His touches continued down his shoulders and legs, and soon Todd had the strength to stand on his hooves while his lover took him from behind.<br />
 <br />
“You’ve been such a good boy!” Chawhee cooed and dug into his pocket and produced a sugar cube. “You’re going to be a big producer.”<br />
 <br />
The horseman rubbed Todd’s neck as he strained towards the sugar cube in his hand. Neck bones popped as his neck stretched a foot to the palm of Chawhee’s hand. A rub from the horseman’s hooflet and a mane grew from his neck, long and cream-colored. His hide was shifting from orange to amber-colored, and soon he was towering over the stable hand.<br />
 <br />
He finally reached the cube of sugar and lipped it from the horseman’s hand. It tasted nice and sweet as he’d never had sugar in his whole life. The effort had taken a lot out of him. He wheezed and let the suction of the jacket and the steady humping of his boyfriend in his sensitive hole wash through him.<br />
 <br />
Todd let his head drop over Chawhee’s shoulders, too exhausted and pleasured to do anything but seek respite.<br />
 <br />
“There, their big boy,” Chawhee smiled, patting Todd’s neck. “Almost done now. Just let all those thoughts get sucked away.”<br />
 <br />
“You aren’t…” Todd rolled a thicker tongue around in a mouth too small for it. “Going to stretch my face?”<br />
 <br />
“You want me to, Bud?” Chawhee asked softly, gently stroking the side of his face, Todd’s jaw creaking and stretching under his touch, facial features starting to distend.<br />
 <br />
“B-Bud?” Todd asked, working his sore jaw.<br />
 <br />
“That’s your new name, Bud.” Chawhee leaned forward and kissed Todd on the lips.<br />
 <br />
“I…” Todd licked his lips as they plumped and blackened, little bristles springing up around them.<br />
 <br />
“Yeah?” Chawhee encouraged.<br />
 <br />
“Stretch.” Todd managed.<br />
 <br />
“Okay, Bud,” Chawhee whispered. “All you have to do is deep-throat this.”<br />
 <br />
Chawhee unzipped his pants and his huge, equine erection sprang out. A strong barnyard musk wafted off it. Todd’s mouth watered at the sight of such a lovely-smelling member bobbing inches away from his face.<br />
 <br />
Todd’s rubbery lips stretched towards it on their own, and Chawhee’s hand guide his mouth onto it. At first, it barely fit, but after swallowing a load of precum, Todd’s mouth started to shift and change. It creaked forward another inch, widening as teeth grew larger and flatter, fighting for space in the crowded mouth. The more dick he took, the wider his face stretched. <br />
 <br />
Chawhee began to press down gently, forcing more and more cock into Todd’s mouth. At first, his mouth was able to keep up, but then he hit the medial rings. His tongue lapped around the cock and the downward pressure from Chawhee’s hand-built.<br />
 <br />
Then, with a pop, the medial ring entered his mouth and hit the back of his throat. Todd’s eyes watered as he grew closer to the horseman&#39;s musky sheathe. His throat swelled wider, accepting the ring, but the ring flared wider, lodging itself there. Todd panicked, making gurgling sounds.<br />
 <br />
“Ready for it Bud?” Chawhee asked, hands positioning themselves on his head, getting a steady grip. “You’ve been a real good boy. After you foal, I think I’ll change you into my partner. Okay?”<br />
 <br />
Not waiting for an answer, Chawhee pulled.<br />
 <br />
Thanks to the flared medial ring lodged in his throat, his mouth stayed stuck in place around Chawhee&#39;s massive shaft. His face pulled upwards like taffy in the stable hand&#39;s grip. Bones creaked and lengthened, and the dome of Todd’s forehead began to slope. As his eyes bulged and grew large and dark, his memories began to fade.<br />
 <br />
As though sensing the shift, Mark began thrusting faster and faster, slamming into Todd’s prostate. The automaker shifted into high gear, sucking and tugging his cock in tandem with the stallion’s thrusts. As Todd’s skull reshaped, his mind was filled with years of training and a growing feeling of contentment with his situation. <br />
 <br />
There was a gurgling from the machine as his mind was coaxed out of the tip of his huge cock bit by bit, swallowed up. His memories of going to the casino, of being human went first in a swell of precum that glugged into the milker. <br />
 <br />
Chawhee pulled in the same slow, inexorable manner as he’d done with Troy, letting Todd savor it.<br />
 <br />
Todd&#39;s love of Mark went next, whisked away with a suck and a whir of the cock sleeve. He managed a whicker of pleasure as the milky liquid was sucked out of him, eyes rolling <br />
 <br />
Chawhee stopped pulling and began fucking the horse’s face roughly.<br />
 <br />
“Fuck, you’re such a good horse!” The stable hand said, bucking wildly. “Such a-such a big, strong Clydesdale. Big and proud and hard-working.”<br />
 <br />
Todd grew even larger, almost twelve feet tall, more muscle and fat growing on his massive frame. The horseman’s cock started twitching and jerking inside Clydesdale&#39;s mouth, a torrent of cum gushing down Todd’s throat. In the throes of orgasm, Chawhee gave a great tug, and Todd&#39;s skull popped into shape.<br />
 <br />
His skull shrank instantly, forcing all of Todd’s thoughts to the only exit he had-his balls. His great balls churned and burned with heat as he reached his climax. They tensed and rose, and Todd threw his huge head back and whinnied as hot, thick cum burst from his flared cock head, gushing into the collector and filling the thing.<br />
 <br />
Cum squelched around the base of the collector sleeve as the machine was overwhelmed with all of Todd’s thoughts. It began dribbling down his balls, which sloshed heavily with even more seed, semen that was still being sucked out. Soon, nothing was left of Todd, the final bit squirting out when his cock gave one last twitch.<br />
 <br />
Three chips rolled out of the huge Clydesdale’s head. The other horse, which it knew vaguely as its mate dismounted and nipped it playfully on the shoulder and pranced away. The horse made to follow it.<br />
 <br />
Chawhee grinned and picked up the last Chips. He tucked his flaccid horse-cock back in his pants. Maybe he could make it a threesome.<br />
 <br />
The wall of the arena exploded, shrapnel flying. Horses screamed and panicked, running out of the arena into the pasture. Chawhee stabilized himself by hanging onto the big, beautiful Clydesdale.<br />
 <br />
“Dispel!” A voice boomed.<br />
 <br />
Todd gave a whinny, body shrinking and compacting, orange and cream fur poofing. By the time he hit the ground, he was back in anthro fox form. He lay there panting, watching as Chawhee unspooled a length of rope and formed it into a lasso, spinning it over his head.<br />
 <br />
“Fireball!”<br />
 <br />
A fireball caught Chawhee straight in the chest.<br />
 <br />
Todd dove for the floor as another ball of fire barreled past, striking the horseman just as he was recovering. The smell of burning hairs filled the air as the stable hand stumbled back from Todd. The horseman looked up, hatred clear in his eyes. Todd followed his glare to a figure who was silhouetted in the new opening in the wall of the arena.<br />
 <br />
His Xarxos. <br />
 <br />
The huge fox glared back at the horseman and turned to Todd.<br />
 <br />
“Gather up your friends. Hurry!” His Xarxos said nostrils flared in anger.<br />
 <br />
“What about him?” Todd asked, hand on his Book.<br />
 <br />
“He’s a fight. Get them all back into the stables. Now!” His Xarxos bellowed.<br />
 <br />
Todd nodded and ran to round past Chawhee, who was focused on Xarxos, twirling the lasso over his head. Somehow, he needed to round everyone up. And he had zero experience with horses.<br />
 <br />
He glanced back once, seeing Chawhee and Xarxos battle it out, the horseman trying to lasso the fox. Todd was pretty sure what would happen if Xarxos was caught. He hurried, gathering the stray horses.<br />
 <br />
It turned out to be relatively simple. Just whistling brought the horses running to him like well-trained dogs. He walked back towards the barn, clapping and encouraging them to enter.<br />
 <br />
By the time he got back, a charred form lay huddled on the ground. Xarxos lay next to it, panting, greasy soot covering him. Chawhee was dead.<br />
 <br />
Todd grimaced, leading all the horses inside.<br />
 <br />
“I, uh, didn’t know who was who, so I just brought them all back,” Todd said apologetically. “They’re well-behaved, I thought it would be, you know, harder.”<br />
 <br />
“Get inside too,” Xarxos ordered. “This place is an hour away from the casino, so you need to hold them off until I get back, got it?”<br />
 <br />
Todd nodded, stepping into the stables. Xarxos put everyone’s belongings into a makeshift bundle. Todd rolled his bracelet onto his wrist and looked up at Xarxos, who looked a bit panicked.<br />
 <br />
“I love you,” Todd said.<br />
 <br />
“You don’t know anything about me.” Xarxos grimaced.<br />
 <br />
Todd was perplexed by his response.<br />
 <br />
“Wha-?”<br />
 <br />
“Mass Dispel.” Xarxos pointed. <br />
 <br />
.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
 <br />
The stables shifted, growing hazy, before reforming into a bathroom. Everyone was reeling with the shock of the transformations. Todd dutifully handed their chips and Books back. Other people he didn’t know were staggering to their feet, clutching their heads. Todd felt bad for them because aside from becoming human, they were blanks.<br />
 <br />
“Why are we naked?” Mark asked Todd.<br />
 <br />
“The bathroom was a trap,” Todd explained. “It turned into a stable, and we were the horses.”<br />
 <br />
“Son of a bitch!” Troy kicked a trash can. “Todd, give us some clothes. Let’s kick those fucker’s asses!”<br />
 <br />
Five minutes later, everyone was clothed. They gave themselves a once-over in the mirror, Troy, and Todd preparing the spells they might need, going over the tactics. Then, as a group, they stepped outside.<br />
 <br />
Standing in the middle of the casino lobby were ED Dolan, Mind Dolan, and Robo Dolan. <br />
 <br />
Upon seeing the group walk out of the bathroom, Robo Dolan began slow clapping. <br />
 <br />
“Bravo, bravo!” he said, his electronic voice ringing out through the empty lobby. “I didn’t think you’d manage to fix that reality shift! Good thing you did, because now we know Todd’s Xarxos must have the Book of Arcane. And he’s an hour away.” <br />
 <br />
“What the hell are you doing here?” Xavier asked, stepping forward. “We had a deal!”<br />
 <br />
“Why I’m just here to thank you for holding up your end of our little bargain,” Robo Dolan said. “I must say, being able to stop time does some real wonders.” The robot held up his left hand, revealing three rings on his fingers. <br />
 <br />
“Y-You bastard!” Xavier shouted. “You can’t just steal those rings from me!” <br />
 <br />
“Can and did. Shame that these aren’t the real things though.” <br />
 <br />
“How did you know those were fakes?!” Troy shouted. “I didn’t tell anyone that they were fakes!” <br />
 <br />
“We tested them out once we got our hands on them,” Mind Dolan said. “There was a limited amount of spells we could use, so that kind of gave it away.”<br />
 <br />
“Now, if you excuse us, we’ll be taking those books from you,” Robo Dolan said. <br />
 <br />
“Like hell you are!” Rusty growled. “You’ll have to take down four of us to get all the books you need!” <br />
 <br />
“Oh, I wasn’t talking to you, mutt. I was talking to him.” Robo Dolan pointed at Todd. “Why would we ever bother taking on four book users when we could just take on one and get the same books? The odds are much more in our favor that way.” <br />
 <br />
“Oh, shit…” Mark said suddenly. “When Prime Dolan said not to tell anyone about your books, he was talking about the other versions of himself…” <br />
 <br />
“Likely so we wouldn’t get any ideas and try to stab him in the back,” Mind Dolan said. “What a paranoid motherfucker.” <br />
 <br />
“Fuck…we have to fight?” Todd asked, looking nervously at the three Dolans in front of him. “I-I don’t think I can do this…” <br />
 <br />
“You’ll be fine,” Rusty said, stepping forward. “Rok and I will help you out.” The Cerberus-morph looked over at the cyclops. “Rok, you take Mind! I’ll take the dragon!” Rok nodded and turned his attention towards Mind Dolan, his eye narrowing. <br />
 <br />
Mind Dolan smirked. “You want to fight, you one-eyed freak?” he asked. “Then come and get me!” Mind Dolan ran up the stairs to the Body floor, and Rok quickly gave chase. <br />
 <br />
ED Dolan sighed. “That fool’s just asking to get himself killed,” the dragon said before floating after Mind Dolan and Rok. <br />
 <br />
“Hey, get back here you damn snake!” Rusty shouted, sprinting after the dragon. That only left Todd, Mark, Troy, and Xavier alone in the lobby with Robo Dolan. <br />
 <br />
“Well, looks like you’re outnumbered, you hunk of junk!” Troy shouted. “Why don’t you just back off and leave us alone?” <br />
 <br />
“Now this doesn’t seem fair at all,” Robo Dolan said, shaking his head. “I propose a one-on-one fight instead.” <br />
 <br />
“And why the hell would we ever agree to that?!” Todd growled. <br />
 <br />
“Because if you don’t…” The robot pointed at Mark. “I’ll turn him into nothing more than a pile of dust.” Before any of them could do anything, Robo Dolan shouted “Progression!” Instantly, Mark began to change. His white fur began to dull, becoming more of a grayish silver color. His body began to lose much of its muscle definition, becoming frail and weak. <br />
 <br />
“Wh-What…What’s happening?” Mark asked, his voice sounding much more hoarse and raspy. “Why…Why do I feel…so weak?” The fox’s legs began to shake as he struggled to take a step forward. He suddenly cried out in pain as his back forced him to hunch over. <br />
 <br />
“Stop!” Todd shouted. “You’re killing him!” <br />
 <br />
“That’s the point,” Robo Dolan replied coldly. <br />
 <br />
The elderly fox began to wobble, unable to keep his balance. Mark started to fall forward, but Troy quickly caught him before he hit the ground. <br />
 <br />
“Ah…thank you, young man…” Mark said. “It’s nice to know that today’s youth still cares for old farts like me.” Troy knelt down and gently set Mark on the ground, and Todd quickly dropped to his knees. <br />
 <br />
“Mark? Mark, are you okay?!” the younger fox asked, tears beginning to pool in his eyes. <br />
 <br />
“I’m fine Todd…” the elderly fox replied. “But…I think my time is almost up. I just want you to know that…” <br />
 <br />
“I’ll fight you, Dolan!” <br />
 <br />
Robo Dolan lowered his hand. “Finally,” he said. “I thought you were going to just let him die.” <br />
 <br />
Todd stood up, glaring at the robot. “Change him back.” <br />
 <br />
Robo Dolan raised his hand and pointed and Mark. “Regression.” <br />
 <br />
Almost instantly, Mark returned to his normal age. The fox sat up, looking around in a panic. Todd sighed in relief, letting a few tears fall down his face. <br />
 <br />
“Now then, let’s make a deal,” Robo Dolan said. “I challenge you to a one-on-one duel. I am only allowed to attack you, and you are only allowed to attack me. Your friends are not allowed to fight me. If they do, then you automatically forfeit the fight and die on the spot. Do we have a deal?” <br />
 <br />
Todd turned and looked at Mark, Troy, and Xavier. Troy looked nervous like he had little to no faith in Todd to come out on top. Xavier looked as if he didn’t care about what was going on, which made a bit of sense. The stag had no real reason to root for Todd to win. The fox was going to look at Mark, but he stopped himself. He couldn’t bear to see the terrified expression in his boyfriend’s eyes. <br />
 <br />
“Alright,” Todd said. “You have yourself a deal.” <br />
 <br />
Robo Dolan smirked and mouthed something quietly. Then, in the blink of an eye, he appeared directly in front of Todd. Before the fox could react, the robot threw a sucker punch at his jaw, causing Todd to fall backward onto the ground. He tried to get up, but Robo Dolan stomped on his hand. The fox cried out in pain, only for Robo Dolan to kick his jaw. <br />
 <br />
“Aww, what’s wrong, little fox?” the robot asked sarcastically. “I never specified <i>how</i> we could attack each other. Using spells on you would honestly be such a waste. I mean, in most timelines, you’re dead so early on.” Todd’s head began to slump down, but Robo Dolan grabbed the fur on top of his head and held it up. <br />
 <br />
“Hey now, I didn’t say you could tap out yet!” Robo Dolan said. “After all, we’re only just getting started!” The robot proceeded to slam Todd’s face onto the hard, marble floor, causing blood to spray out of his nose and mouth. <br />
 <br />
“Oof! Looks like you could use some tissues!” The robot pulled a tissue out from his pocket and proceeded to press it against Todd’s bloody nose. <br />
 <br />
“You know the best part about all this?” Robo Dolan asked. “It’s the fact that I can make this feel much, <i>much</i>, worse.” As Todd slowly got back onto his hands and knees, Robo Dolan suddenly disappeared in the blink of an eye. In the same second, he was sent flying backward a few feet, immense pain in his side. It was as if Dolan had somehow kicked him ten times within a single second! But how was that even possible?!<br />
 <br />
“Wh-What the hell?!” Mark shouted. “How did he do that?! He was just in front of Todd, but then he was beside him!” <br />
 <br />
“He stopped time,” Troy said quietly. “He’s not fighting. He’s toying with Todd.” <br />
 <br />
“Oh my God…he is like GIO…” <br />
 <br />
Robo Dolan then appeared next to Todd and kicked him again, sending the fox flying back to where he was initially. <br />
 <br />
“This is…I can’t watch this…” Xavier said, turning away from the fight. <br />
 <br />
Todd was breathing heavily, his vision starting to blur. This stupid fucking robot was stopping time before he could even do anything. Most of his ribs had to be broken after all those kicks, and his jaw was more than broken after it was slammed into the floor. This…This wasn’t how he was supposed to die. He was supposed to die after living a long, fulfilling life with Mark and Xarxos. Tears began to pool in his eyes as he realized that he was going to die, just like most of the other versions of him.<br />
 <br />
“We…We have to help him!” Mark shouted. “There has to be something we can do!” <br />
 <br />
“We can’t attack Robo Dolan, or else Todd loses,” Troy said. “But then again, he’s already getting his ass kicked.” <br />
 <br />
Mark desperately tried to think of something, <i>anything</i>, he could do to help Todd. There had to be some kind of last resort…<br />
 <br />
<i>“Then what if one of us turned into something from the Book of Myth?” Todd asked.<br />
 <br />
“No, out of the question,” Xarxos responded quickly. “Those spells require a large amount of energy as well, and they’re fairly dangerous. I’d prefer if those spells either go completely unused or are only used as an absolute last resort. Do you both understand me?”</i><br />
 <br />
“That’s it!” Mark shouted, making Troy turn his head. <br />
 <br />
“What’s it?” the phoenix asked. <br />
 <br />
“Give me the Book of Myth!” <br />
 <br />
“Xavier has it.” Before the stag could even protest, Mark grabbed the ring on his hooflet and pulled it off. He took a deep breath before putting it on. The taste of copper suddenly filled his mouth, but it dispersed quickly. <br />
 <br />
“What the hell are you doing?!” Troy hissed, trying to keep his voice down so Robo Dolan wouldn’t notice. “You can’t cast spells on Robo Dolan! You’re going to get us all killed!” <br />
 <br />
“I know I can’t,” Mark said. “That’s why I’m not using it on Dolan.” The white-furred fox pointed at his lover. He needed to become something fast…faster than Robo Dolan could stop time…and Mark knew the perfect creature. <br />
 <br />
“Divine Shift!” <br />
 <br />
…<br />
 <br />
…<br />
 <br />
…<br />
 <br />
But nothing happened…<br />
 <br />
“Wh-What?!” Mark shouted. “I…I know I said the right spell! Xarxos told me some of the spells in the Book of Myth, and I know that’s one of them!”<br />
 <br />
&#8232;&#8232;“Aww, you tried to find a loophole to help your friend and it didn’t work,” Robo Dolan mocked, giving Todd’s limp body another hard kick to the side. “Too bad. At least he knows that you tried to save him. Well, time to finish the job.” <br />
 <br />
Todd turned to look at Mark, his face was battered and bloody. The white-furred fox felt tears begin to pool in his eyes just by looking at how badly his boyfriend was beaten. The bloody fox gave Mark a weak smile. <br />
 <br />
“Thanks…for trying,” he said weakly. “I….I love you…”<br />
 <br />
As Robo Dolan raised his foot to deliver the final blow, he jumped back just in time as a large bolt of lightning burst through the glass ceiling of the casino, striking Todd’s limp body.<br />
 <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
 <br />
A jolting, excruciating pain filled Todd’s body as the bolt of lightning struck him. The fox opened his mouth to scream, but nothing came out. His body wouldn’t respond to his attempts to move it. It was as if everything inside him had been completely fried. <br />
 <br />
Then, the pain disappeared. <br />
 <br />
Shaking slightly, Todd sat up, immediately noticing the absence of pain in his sides. He reached down and felt his ribs. They felt intact. After a few seconds, he realized that the hand he was using to feel his ribs was also the one that Robo Dolan had crushed just a few minutes prior. He bent his fingers and balled his hand into a fist. No pain whatsoever. The fox stood up before looking over at Mark.<br />
 <br />
“What did you do?” he asked. <br />
 <br />
“I…I tried to turn you into something from the Book of Myth,” Mark explained. “Nothing happened, then a bolt of lightning struck you, and now you’re…fine?”<br />
 <br />
“Yeah, no pain whatsoever!” <br />
 <br />
“That’s good, but I don’t understand why the spell didn’t work.” <br />
 <br />
“Maybe the spell hasn’t-” The fox was cut off as his body suddenly jumped to the side, effortlessly dodging a punch from Robo Dolan. The robot looked just as confused as Todd did.<br />
 <br />
“What the hell?!” Robo Dolan shouted. “How did you dodge that?!” <br />
 <br />
“I…I don’t know…” Todd replied. “I’m not complaining though!” Robo Dolan growled in frustration before throwing another punch that Todd dodged easily. The robot proceeded to throw another, then another, then another…<br />
 <br />
Punch after punch, the fox was somehow managing to dodge all of them easily, eventually getting to the point where his body started dodging before Robo Dolan even threw his punches. Todd was completely unaware of how fast he was truly moving, appearing as nothing more than a blur to those who were watching him. <br />
 <br />
“How…How are you moving so fast?!” Robo Dolan shouted in anger. <br />
 <br />
“I don’t know!” Todd replied. “I just am!”<br />
 <br />
“You know what? It doesn’t matter how fast you’re going! I’ll just make…you…stand…still!” <br />
 <br />
Todd wasn’t entirely sure why, but Robo Dolan’s voice had suddenly slowed down significantly. Come to think of it, he’d also stopped throwing punches. The fox stopped moving, only to see Robo Dolan standing completely still. He had stopped throwing punches and was now beginning to extend his arm, one of his fingers beginning to extend slightly. <br />
 <br />
“Hey…what the hell are you doing?” Todd asked, walking up to the robot and waving his hand in front of Robo Dolan’s face. The robot didn’t respond...or move…<br />
 <br />
“Uh…helloooooo?” the fox asked. “Earth to robot!” Robo Dolan still didn’t move. <br />
 <br />
“Hey guys, I think his circuits are fried,” Todd said, turning to face his friends. “What do you…” He trailed off as he realized that Troy, Mark, and Xavier were all frozen in place as well, each one with a look of shock on their face. <br />
 <br />
“What the hell?” Todd asked himself. “What’s going on?” <br />
 <br />
A strange tingling feeling in his paws made the fox look down, only for his eyes to widen in shock. His paws were beginning to grow bigger and more beast-like, and the fur on his paws was changing from black to a light electric blue color. His claws, meanwhile, were changing color as well. They turned to a dark blue at the base, with the color gradually getting lighter until the tips were white. It almost looked as if he’d had someone paint them.<br />
 <br />
“What…?” Todd watched as his hands began to change to somewhat resemble his paws, with the black fur turning a light electric blue and his claws changing colors. <br />
 <br />
The electric blue fur began to spread up the fox’s paws before it began to gradually shift to white. The white fur spread up his body, with slight accents of electric blue appearing here and there. His tail lengthened slightly, becoming slightly furrier as streaks of electric blue fur grew in. <br />
 <br />
As his fur changed color, Todd’s body began to gain a bit more muscle. He still had a twunkish physique, but his body was now a bit larger. As his shoulders broadened, the male’s muzzle pushed out slightly as his eyes turned a bright electric blue color. Todd had no idea what he was becoming until he saw his reflection in one of the nearby windows. <br />
 <br />
Staring back at him was a wolf…kind of. He resembled a wolf in body shape and size, but his fur colors made him look like someone’s fursona. The wolf couldn’t help but grin slightly. <br />
 <br />
“God damn, I look pretty good,” he said to himself. He stopped admiring his reflection and looked back at Robo Dolan. The robot still hadn’t moved. Neither had Mark, Troy, or Xavier.<br />
 <br />
A clock on the wall suddenly caught Todd’s attention. It was a standard analog clock that read a time of 1:45 AM. However, the second hand wasn’t moving. Confused, the wolf moved closer to the clock. Had Robo Dolan somehow stopped time and made him the only one that was affected by it? No, that couldn’t be the case. Why would Robo Dolan give him a huge advantage in their fight? When the second hand ticked forward, Todd realized what was happening. <br />
 <br />
He was going so fast that time had slowed to a crawl. <br />
 <br />
A shit-eating grin appeared on the wolf’s muzzle as he realized what this meant. <br />
 <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
 <br />
Todd waltzed into the kitchen of the restaurant on the main floor. He moved around some chefs and servers, peeking in pantries and drawers to find something that would work. Eventually, he settled on a large rectangular baking pan that was sitting on a drying rack. He hoisted the pan down from the drying rack and carried it out into the main dining area, setting it down on an empty table. From there, he walked around every table, opening the napkins that the silverware was wrapped in to take out one particular utensil: the steak knife. After a few “minutes” of walking around, Todd had a pan full of knives. <br />
 <br />
As Todd picked up the pan, he noticed someone out of the corner of his eye. Standing near the back of the restaurant was a large, muscular version of Dolan. The wolf grinned and grabbed a knife out of the pan before making his way over to the bodybuilder. &#8232;&#8232;“Now let’s see here,” Todd thought out loud to himself. “I don’t want to kill you…just weaken you so that you can’t fight if one of the Dolans needs to switch with you.” He knelt and aimed his knife at Bodybuilder Dolan’s leg before throwing it forward. He watched as the knife quickly flew forward before slowing down to match the world around it. When time started flowing normally again, the knife would be buried deep in the bodybuilder’s leg. <br />
 <br />
“Perfect,” Todd said to himself as he stood up. “Now to find the other Dolans.” <br />
 <br />
After leaving the restaurant, Todd walked around the entire casino, throwing knives at every single version of Dolan he could find. He made sure to throw each knife in a way so it wouldn’t kill its target outright. At most, the knives would severely limit the Dolans’ ability to cast spells. After all, it&#39;s hard to cast spells when your body is slowly being drained of its energy. <br />
 <br />
After finishing his run around the casino, Todd returned to the main lobby and noticed that things were now slightly different. Robo Dolan now had his book in his left hand, and his right hand was pointing at where Todd had been standing. The wolf walked up to the robot and pulled the book out of his hand. <br />
 <br />
“And that takes care of that,” Todd said to himself. He moved back to where he had been standing before and stood perfectly still. He wasn’t entirely sure how or why, but he knew that this was how time would begin flowing normally again. In the blink of an eye, the wolf’s perception of time returned to normal. <br />
 <br />
Robo Dolan pointed at Todd and shouted “Freeze!” The robot’s angry expression then shifted to one of shock as he realized that his spell hadn’t worked and the fox was no longer standing in front of him. <br />
 <br />
“What the hell?! Who are you?!” <br />
 <br />
“The same guy you were beating the shit out of a second ago!” Todd replied. <br />
 <br />
Robo Dolan’s eyes narrowed. “So the Book of Myth did manage to change you,” he observed. “No matter, I’ll change you into something harmless! Inanimate!” <br />
 <br />
Nothing happened. <br />
 <br />
“I believe that you’re looking for this?” the wolf asked, holding up Robo Dolan’s book before throwing it as hard as he could into the nearby fountain. The robot turned to sprint for the book, only for Todd to suddenly appear in front of him. <br />
 <br />
“What the fuck?! What kind of creature are you?!” <br />
 <br />
“He’s a Raij&#363;,” Mark spoke up, getting both Robo Dolan&#39;s and Todd’s attention. “They’re servants of the Japanese thunder god Rajin. Legends said they were the embodiment of lightning itself.” <br />
 <br />
“Lightning itself, huh?” Todd asked, getting an idea. Before Robo Dolan could even think about moving away, the wolf grabbed the robot and threw him to the ground. Robo Dolan tried to get up, but Todd pounced on top of him, pressing his hand to the robot’s chest. Then, without any warning, the wolf began to expel volts upon volts of electricity into the robot. Robo Dolan’s eyes went wide as he felt his circuits beginning to fry from the sudden overload of electricity. <br />
 <br />
“E-Error…S-S-System malfunction…BZZT…neural n-n-network f-failing…primary s-systems shutting down…”<br />
 <br />
&#8232;As Todd took his hand off the robot’s chest, the light in Robo Dolan’s eyes faded as the machine lost power. The Raij&#363; stood up and looked down at the lifeless machine. <br />
 <br />
“Holy fuck…” Troy said as he approached Todd. He looked down at the robot, a look of concern on his face. “Is he…?”<br />
 <br />
“He’s not dead,” Todd said. “I just overloaded his system. No need to worry about any Funny Lover shenanigans happening.” &#8232;&#8232;Troy cocked his head in confusion. <br />
 <br />
“Funny…Lover?” <br />
 <br />
Todd opened his mouth to start explaining but stopped himself. “I’ll explain later,” he said. “Right now, we’ve got a casino to take over.”</p>
