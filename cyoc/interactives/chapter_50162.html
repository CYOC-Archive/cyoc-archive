<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You're sure you can do this?&quot; Isabelle asked lustily as she watched Zack's penis slowly rise out of its sheath.<br />
<br />
Pearl, June, and Grace also looked concerned at the charcoal black male as they began feeling their own lust rise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Zack smiled, &quot;a little sore but I'm fine. I was, after all made to do this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Isabelle spoke and began to place herself above Zack's rising member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be gentle,&quot; Zack told the female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we be saying that?&quot; Isabelle asked as she began to lower herself onto Zack's member.<br />
<br />
Isabelle's pleasure filled barks soon echoed out of the room. The others were quick to join in.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;When is it our turn, Alpha Female?&quot; Hope asked as Jensen plunged his own member into Darla.<br />
<br />
&quot;We go after the Master is finished with the twins,&quot; Kaylee answered as she massaged her own loins while she sat on the she-wolf that had once made her life miserable.<br />
<br />
Jensen, meanwhile, maintained his steady thrusts into Darla ignoring his mate and friend's interaction. The blond wolf's massive breasts bounced with each thrust, and her ecstatic barks and yips were music to his ears as gave out his own growling moan. And Fran's sexual nibbling at his neck and grinding her own loins against him let him know how much she wanted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... so... good... Master,&quot; Darla barked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howl for me,&quot; Jensen commanded as he began to suck one of Darla's erect nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yeeeeeeEEEEEEEESSSSSSS!&quot; Darla howled at her master's touch.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Nick, meanwhile was in the world of his dreams as Nicole slid onto his ready erection. To a great extent, he had always loved her, even when they were human. She was fierce and loyal, and deceptively strong. But he had never been able to really attract her attention, which lead to a lot of his more immature acts. After all, negative attention was better then being ignored. But now, he was certain that she wasn't giving him negative attention as he let his paws play with Alexandra and Megan's breasts while he sucked one of Nicole's nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Nick, yes,&quot; Nicole moaned, enraptured by the sensations running through her body.<br />
<br />
He was giving her what she had secretly wanted for a long time as well, but had kept hidden under too many different inhibitions that had no relationship with her feelings... but those inhibitions had largely vanished when she became a wolf-woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make... me... cum... Nick,&quot; Nicole gave her own pleasure filled and panting barks as Nick continued to thrust into her.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Ashley gave a slight moan as Lawrence started thrusting into her, and worked over one breast with one paw and the base of her tail with the other. He also managed to suck on her other breast's nipple as he thrusted, &quot;Oh... yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Margot and Caroline found themselves half involved in helping the blue and sky blue enjoy the male they were in the room with  as well as trying to help pleasure Lawrence as well. Lawrence's member was easily seen when erect, and while it was no where near as large as Nick or Zack, and certainly not the Master, but the white male did as much as possible to make up for it. <br />
<br />
And that, Lawrence was actually quite good in that regard. If only his member matched Zack and Nick... Margot and Caroline were already quite certain that he would have brought Ashley to orgasm three times already if he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should ask the Master if we could use our turns to improve Lawrence and Roger,&quot; Margot said to Caroline, &quot;they've already used their turns, so it won't be like we're losing turns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline nodded, &quot;We'd technically gain an extra turn, since only one of us would be needed to improve them. And maybe it'd take some wind out of Zack's attempting to have all of us to himself and relax Nicole's temper.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Full house,&quot; Maxine smiled, &quot;I win!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're cheating some how!&quot; Millie accused, &quot;how many times have we plaid cards and someone gets a full house! My hand was good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not good enough,&quot; Maxine smiled, &quot;and just how could I cheat... on the first hand, no less, hide cards in your cleavage?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has a point there, suguh,&quot; Robyn told the other she-wolf at the table, &quot;our wolf-hood improves this game's ability to deter cheating. We have no place to hide cards. Maxi won, and you know what that means.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maxine slid her chair back as the magenta and orange and white females slowly stood up. Roger got up the slowest and approached nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Roger,&quot; Maxine smiled as Millie and Robyn began to tease her nipples, &quot;I've reserved you the central position.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not that big, though,&quot; the pastel green male said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever heard its not the size of the wolf in the fight, but the size of the fight in the wolf?&quot; Maxine smiled, her legs spread.<br />
<br />
Maxine then closed her eyes, expecting feel Roger's member entering her. After a few moments, she felt something different, which made her open her eyes again. Roger was filling his part of their &quot;bet&quot; by pleasing her as was down and licking at Maxine's clitoris. She sighed slightly, giving off a slight moan. Oral sex was better then nothing, and Roger would surely win a hand or two during their game. They'd each get a turn.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Ulysses sighed as pleasure filled howls began echo up from inside the house. The group had been looking out at the stars above them as the night continued to pass overhead. That only made Ulysses look down in a depressed manner. He was surrounded by beautiful she-wolves, and while he found them all attractive, he was just too young for them to seriously consider as a mate, which made him feel like he'd let them all down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I told you not everything was about sex,&quot; Sarah spoke to the purple male.<br />
<br />
He weakly smiled back to the lavender female. He wasn't about tell her, but he was starting to look up to her as an older sister, since she was talking to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, come on, you're missing out on the discussion by the &quot;convention&quot;,&quot; Sarah chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are they discussing?&quot; Ulysses asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who would win in a fight, Worf or the Master?&quot; Sarah shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No weapons?&quot; Ulysses asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; Sarah sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then the Master would win,&quot; Ulysses said, &quot;easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen slowly rolled Fran next to Darla as the two blond she wolves drifted into a contented sleep. His large member still stood at full attention, serving to arouse Kaylee and Hope all the more. He then turned over to eye his mate sitting on Hope, her nipples fully erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe it your turn, now Hope,&quot; Jensen smiled, getting some sense that Kaylee wanting to save herself for last.<br />
<br />
Kaylee then stood up and moved to one side of Jensen while Hope got up her position and began to approach him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Old cheer-leading days still work, huh?&quot; Jensen smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rah, rah,&quot; Hope gave a &quot;cheer&quot; as she plunged herself down, and within moments, was howling out her own rapture.</p>
