<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The park entrance was a welcome sight to Jeff, and no sooner than their vehicle was stopped and the attention of his parents was on making sure Jack and Josh were ready for the walk, he made his move. There was a small ranger&#39;s office and a utility block that certainly had to contain toilets in it, and he set off towards it with some hope. At least the bra-clad mass in his pants was staying put, even with the situation yet to resemble the pool shed scare he&#39;d suffered, but Jeff knew it was getting there. He was maybe three quarters full, not yet at the urgent level of needing to empty himself into a bucket. With a bathroom in sight, he could stop that from even being necessary.<br />
<br />
Rounding the corner, he found the entrance to the men&#39;s side. The door was closed, but when he tried the handle, it was also locked. With a glance to the women&#39;s, he saw it was shut too. He tried the handle. Also locked. Then he saw a temporary sign on the dividing panel between them. The current date was printed at the top, and underneath it was a notice:<br />
<br />
&quot;Maintenance and upgrades on our park utilities are scheduled for today. Due to this, the public restrooms will be out of order from 9am, and inaccessible until work is finished at approximately 5pm. We apologise to any park visitors for the inconvenience this may cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aghast, Jeff read the sign twice, making sure he wasn&#39;t mistaken.<br />
<br />
5pm.<br />
<br />
That was HOURS away! His hopes of using an indoor bathroom were dashed, and Jeff had to take a deep breath and retrace his steps back to his family. The only way to cure this before it got out of hand was to find somewhere in the outdoors. At least there was plenty of space? He&#39;d just need an opportunity away from prying eyes. Maybe a minute of peace would be enough? Glum, he couldn&#39;t help noticing too, that his perceptions were changing -- he was becoming more and more attuned to the crotch-breast and its needs.<br />
<br />
Why? Was it really affecting him that much?!<br />
<br />
Like the importance of the male genitals to the masculine identity, his new body part seemed to have taken up residence in his psyche in a similar way, both beloved and demanding. When he needed a milking, it let him know! When he needed to pee, it was even more proactive about giving him indicators. The awareness was powerful, and as Jeff trudged back across the parking lot to his family, his consciousness of the breast&#39;s function as his bladder seemed to be heightened, more acute. He could feel the liquid circling slowly inside him from the movement, more notable than it had been before, and with it a tiny bubbling flowing sensation like a faucet left running on very-low. The breast was busy doing what it had to, which was to steadily convert the breakfast OJ into a problem for him -- a liquid problem he thought he had managed to avoid.<br />
<br />
Nobody was supposed to be so aware of their bodily functions with this much clarity, were they?<br />
<br />
Well, nobody was supposed to have their junk replaced by a breast, either.<br />
<br />
Jeff hated how it made him feel so abnormal, so deviant, but he clung to the one thing that made sense. Just two more days!<br />
<br />
He could do it, he told himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, son.&quot; With the rest of the family already walking on, his dad waited up and Jeff joined him. He was in a chipper mood after the car ride, and struck a conciliatory tone, knowing he might have come off too harsh. &quot;Let&#39;s get going. It&#39;s a good day out, and there&#39;s plenty of our great countryside to see. Your mom and I have wanted to walk this trail for a while. The falls are stunning this time of year. You might even enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed weakly, his head in a bit of a mess despite his resolve to get through it, and they set off after the others.<br />
<br />
The start of it was the worst, as they got moving on the trail&#39;s beginning stage. Though it was doing its job, the bra-cup had tightened a little more, and the crotch-breast still managed to sway lightly back and forth while Jeff followed his dad, the liquid slopping around inside like a bowl of half-formed jello that was constantly on the verge of spilling. Every step felt like it was magnified, and the mass would flop from one thigh to the other and back again, stride after stride. Just walking on its own made him feel like a freak of nature, and for the first few minutes he was very upset, his face going red with an intense inner shame due to his &#39;deformed&#39; body, and he was near to breaking into tears. Fortunately, his dad was engrossed in finally getting back to nature, his attention on their surroundings and taking in the fresh air and cool breeze, along with the sights and sounds of the forest. Jeff was able to compose himself. He&#39;d made a monumental mistake, but he kept telling himself he was tough enough to not let it beat him down. He tried to numb himself to the weirdness of the feelings his body was throwing at him, and it worked, for quite a while.<br />
<br />
That was, until roughly an hour and forty minutes in.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t quite at the busting-to-go stage that he&#39;d reached at the pool shed, but Jeff&#39;s problem had become bad enough -- 90% urine capacity, at a guess. His mom was something of a power-walker when she wanted to explore, and Jack could be a little hyperactive, so they had stayed happily ahead. Jeff&#39;s chance finally came when they started to get out of sight, so his father picked up the pace. Feigning breathlessness, he made an excuse that he&#39;d catch up, which his dad accepted, though telling him not to take long nor wander off, to which he quickly agreed.<br />
<br />
The moment his dad was gone from view, Jeff split off the trail, going a few dozen feet to the other side of a copse of tall evergreens. Safe enough! He was out of any public view, and his hand went to his midriff, moments away from getting the &#39;party&#39; started, when-<br />
<br />
A voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coming out between the trees from the opposite direction of his own approach was a park ranger. Wearing a backpack and carrying a walking-stick, she was an attractive athletic woman, blonde, tall, and kinda stacked, but that first impression was destroyed by the severe expression on her face, and the heavily annoyed tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, I was j-just-&quot; Jeff tried to stammer, shocked scared, not sure whether to be thankful he hadn&#39;t gone further, or terrified of this woman&#39;s attitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you about to to pee here?&quot; She frowned, and tramped over closer to him, her boots crunching on dead leaves and sticks. &quot;Didn&#39;t you see the signs? There are delicate native species all through this area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m s-sorry, I really needed to badly, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are your parents around?&quot; She interrupted. &quot;You should have gone at the park entrance. Why do you think we have public facilities? You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t tell your mom and dad what you were doing.&quot; Without waiting for a response, she pointed back the way he&#39;d come from. &quot;Back to the trail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frightened into submission, Jeff couldn&#39;t think of anything to say and just did what she said, retreating and rejoining where had left from, with the ranger right behind him. Before she departed, she gave him one final admonishment. &quot;Don&#39;t try anything like that again. There&#39;s nothing cool about breaking the rules. I&#39;ll have my eye out for you.&quot; She pointed an index finger at him with an air of menace to it. &quot;Understand?&quot; Then she turned away, and stomped off, with a final mutter of: &quot;Men are pigs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heart beating like crazy, Jeff hurriedly jogged onward, too scared of running into her again to even think about trying to pee. Yet, just as he got back within sight of the rest of his family, his nearly-full crotch-breast jiggling around as jarringly as ever, he slowed as he heard something new, and then groaned aloud when he realised what it was.<br />
<br />
The sound of rushing river water.</p>
