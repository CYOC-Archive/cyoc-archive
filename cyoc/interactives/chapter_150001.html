<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was home alone and I wouldn&#39;t get a better chance to search through Mary&#39;s room for the medallion. I spent the next hour carefully going through all her drawers and cupboards looking in likely hiding places. In frustration I had to give up, knowing Mary would be home soon. There was no sign of it. She either had it with her or had hidden it somewhere outside the house. I just got everything back in place before she came home. <br />
<br />
I retreated to my room and pretended I had been there all the time. However 10 minutes later Mary barged in. &#39;Little sister. Somebody has been rifling through my things. Any idea who that might have been?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just putting away the clothes you made me wash&#39; What did she mean by little sister? I was bigger than her and older, Albeit by 7 minutes. However it wasn&#39;t worth an argument.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t lie to me Sam. I expected you to snoop and am actually surprised you took so long. You won&#39;t find the medallion. You would never guess where it is. However it&#39;s clear you have been going through my things. I&#39;ll have to think of a suitable punishment. I don&#39;t like snoops&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Surely this is punishment enough&#39; I gestured to my groin<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. I&#39;m thinking of leaving you like that for an extra week&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s not fair! We made a deal&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well here&#39;s an alternative. Mum&#39;s at work until 9 tonight. How about you cook dinner, in gender appropriate clothes? Either that or an extra week. Your choice&#39;<br />
<br />
 I groaned. &quot;I don&#39;t really have a choice do I?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Good. I have just the outfit. I&#39;ll be right back&#39;<br />
<br />
All I could do was wait to see what she came back with. One night of embarrassment was better than another week as a girl. <br />
<br />
Several minutes later she presented me with a red and white dress. I could remember she wore it on our 15th birthday when we had a party. &#39;I love this dress but I&#39;ve grown too big up top to wear it. It should be perfect for you. Of course you will have to wear your panties and training bra underneath. See you soon Samantha&#39; She had a big smirk on her face as she emphasized the feminized name. She handed me the bag that I knew contained said underwear.  &#39;Remember it&#39;s either this or an extra week&#39;<br />
<br />
I had no choice. &#39;Ok. But leave. Let me have some privacy&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll give you 10 minutes&#39; She left.<br />
<br />
I looked at the clothes in despair. The dress was of cotton with a lace layer at its bottom.  How I regretted using the medallion on Mary when she slept. I had no choice. I had to put the dress on. <br />
<br />
I stripped then pulled up the panties. Of course they were a perfect fit. They actually felt nice on my bottom, better than the boy undies I had been wearing. I struggled doing up the training bra. it was difficult to reach around behind my back to do up the clips but eventually I managed. It was a snug fit as well. The straps dug into my shoulders.<br />
<br />
The dress had a zip up the back. I undid that and stepped in to it. Again I struggled to reach behind myself to do up the zip. I guess it was just a knack that girls learned. The skirt only went to halfway down my thighs. <br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s 10 minutes. Are you dressed? I&#39;m coming in&#39; Before I had a chance to reply Mary opened the door. She squealed with delight. &#39;Your gorgeous...…… Oh, but you need to put the belt on&#39; She picked up a thin red belt that was on my bed. I hadn&#39;t noticed it. She placed it around my waist and fastened it.<br />
<br />
She had me turn around, then adjusted the bra straps. Evidently I had them too tight. &#39;Ok you should start on dinner. Mince and spaghetti. Wear Mum&#39;s apron so the dress doesn&#39;t get stained. I&#39;ll find you some shoes. Your feet look Mum&#39;s size&#39; She skipped off towards Mum&#39;s room. She was really enjoying my humiliation. <br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have a mirror in my own room so took the opportunity to visit the bathroom and have a look at myself. I stood in shock looking at myself. There was a girl with short blond hair staring back at me. She was flat chested but had legs that went on forever. I&#39;m not sure how long I was there for but I was interrupted by Mary sporting a pairs of shoes. I allowed her to put them on my feet, still fascinated at my reflection. <br />
<br />
&#39;Try walking&#39; Mary said. I looked down I was wearing white strap on sandals with a chunky two inch heel. In a daze I walked with Mary out to the kitchen. Walking seemed easy enough. Mary was now putting an apron on me. It was the apron Mum used when cooking. I had forgotten that I was meant to be upset. Was I actually enjoying this? It was certainly a new experience.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll help. It&#39;s nice to have a sister. How about you do the spaghetti and I&#39;ll cook some mince&#39; Mary was actually being nice to me.<br />
<br />
I cooked the spaghetti, I had fulfilled my part of the bargain. But I didn&#39;t insist on changing once the meal was cooked. I ate dinner at the table, sitting opposite Mary, still wearing the white and red dress. Mary dished me out a bowl of ice-cream for dessert. We spoke about our expectations of the first day of school tomorrow. Mary already had made friends with some of the other cheerleaders. I knew nobody. It was only when she asked me about my fears that I came out of my trance.<br />
<br />
&#39;Someone discovering that I&#39;m a girl&#39; I said. Immediately I became embarrassed about my attire. Quickly I got up and stumbled to my room, shut the door and took off the girl clothes. I put my Sam clothes back on. <br />
<br />
I put the female attire into Mary&#39;s room, returning to the kitchen and without saying a word did the dishes. Mary must have sensed my distress and didn&#39;t say anything. She let me have the TV remote control. I stayed up long enough to welcome Mum home but went to bed soon after.</p>
