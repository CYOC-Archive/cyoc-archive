<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was cold and I fell asleep, and then I had weird dreams all night.<br />
<br />
Drums, saws, some kind of whispering voices speaking in a language I didn't know.  The world took on a sort of <br />
green color, and I felt numb all over.  I dreamed my arms had turned into octopus tentacles, and my legs had <br />
multiplied into dozens of bug-legs, like a centipede.<br />
<br />
I felt something that woke me up, and I was sliding out into daylight again.<br />
<br />
Hector's face was about two inches from mine when I managed to open my eyes.  It was not the best sight - not <br />
that he was ugly or anything, really.  He looked like any other kid, maybe a bit younger than his age. We were <br />
all supposed to be sixteen in this cabin - at least I would be in a week. He was just a bit under-developed, <br />
as if he managed not to have to do any PE classes. Probably went to a private school and paid someone else to <br />
do his gym classes for him.<br />
<br />
I was still groggy from the cold. Hector saw my eyes open, and seemed a bit relieved.  &quot;I was afraid you had <br />
gotten too cold in the night,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;There aren't enough power outlets in this place, so I <br />
couldn't plug in the heat lamps.&quot;<br />
<br />
He somehow managed to drag the blue plastic tarp out onto the porch of the cabin, where the weak, feeble <br />
sunlight of the early morning could shine on me.  It wasn't much, but I started feeling better slowly, even <br />
though I still couldn't move or feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Hector said, &quot;while the other campers are all off eating the swill they call food here, I managed to get <br />
an early breakfast.  I now have time to explain to you what your, transformation, will encompass.&quot;<br />
<br />
When he said &quot;transformation&quot; it was in a creepy mad-scientist sort of way.  I would have rolled my eyes or <br />
made a face, but, I still felt numb all over, and I couldn't move, at least not at will. I was still <br />
breathing, my eyes were trying to follow his movements.  But he didn't notice my eyes trying to roll, or react <br />
if they did. I couldn't really see unless he was up close anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the process of genetic recomposition is much more complicated than these fools realize. My preliminary <br />
injections were preparatory - I actually WAS planning to ask you if you would volunteer, but you were so busy <br />
scorning us weak, nerdish science types to pay attention to the fact that I had placed my equipment on your <br />
bunk for safety.  I would have offered to pay you to volunteer, if you had refused, but it's just as well. <br />
Without the payment I can afford to perform the more extensive mutation.&quot;<br />
<br />
I did NOT like the sound of that last phrase. The blur that was Hector came close enough to see again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be able to blink voluntarily. Blink twice if you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried to ... blink, blink.  It worked! Hooray, I could control... my eyelids. Wonderful. Now I can crawl to <br />
safety with the power of my massive eyelashes. Or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I'm going to feed you now.  Normally snakes eat live prey, but rather than subject you to that, I will <br />
be feeding you a semi-liquid food replacement. It's not bad, certainly tastes better than the burned egg and <br />
half-raw potatoes in grease that seems to be the standard here.&quot;  Hector's voice conveyed the kind of disgust <br />
of someone who had never been forced to survive on BAD camp food, after their first worst meal.<br />
<br />
I would have laughed, if I'd been able to.  The food at this place was one of the many reasons that Camp Yucca <br />
Caca was nicknamed &quot;Yicky Yucky Caca-Phooey&quot; by the campers. The other reasons were many, but the highlight <br />
last year was the crappy un-insulated cabins with their insect population. Termites were frequent visitors, <br />
and last summer we got to watch a war between the termites and the carpenter ants.  The paper-wasps were the <br />
surprise victors. Of course, the latrines here were even more special. The joke was &quot;Why do bears shit in the <br />
woods?&quot; And the answer was &quot;Because it's more sanitary than Camp Yucky Caca-Phooey toilets!&quot;<br />
On top of that, the &quot;showers&quot; were usually cold and nasty.  Hey, at least that was an up-side, I wouldn't have <br />
to put up with the showers or latrines or especially the food.  And I haven't even mentioned the horror that <br />
is &quot;camp activities&quot; - two mandatory hours of misery and humiliation with the camp counselors leading us in <br />
games and recreations that had to be illegal under the Geneva Convention.<br />
<br />
My musing was interrupted by something semi-flexible forcing its way into my mouth, and down my throat. I <br />
almost choked, but it went past my wind-pipe without problems.  When Hector loomed into view again he was <br />
wearing some kind of weird headgear.  &quot;I have a fiber-optic camera on the end of this probe so I can avoid <br />
pumping your lungs full of nutrient fluid,&quot; he said cheerfully. I thought about that when I felt something <br />
warm squeezing into my gut. I couldn't taste anything, of course, but I felt pretty full after a only about <br />
thirty seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm leaving the feeding tube in place for now, it can come out later,&quot; Hector said in a sort of detached <br />
dispassionate voice. &quot;So you know.  I initially planned on something more than the simple Eunectes Murinus - <br />
that's the Green Anaconda, world's largest snake - but I'm not sure if the sample Titanoboa DNA was actually <br />
correctly sequenced. And it might be uncomfortable to return to human afterwards ... assuming that a serpent-<br />
to-serpent change could even work.  So it will be Eunectes Murinus first.&quot;<br />
<br />
He came close again and smiled. It was semi-creepy because he didn't show his teeth or anything, so it looked <br />
a bit like the Grinch with slightly more of a curl at the edges. &quot;Now, so you know, the change to snake will <br />
begin when I inject you with the secondary trigger. I'll also be injecting some additional substances that <br />
will enable a faster modification of bones and organs.  But you should be happy to know that I am using a less <br />
coercive serum so that your head won't change structure completely. Otherwise your brain could be damaged, and <br />
we don't want that to happen again.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice became very serious, and he pulled back the goggle things so I could see his eyes. They looked <br />
remarkably human given the reptilian gaze he'd given me yesterday.  &quot;There are some risks.  I won't hide that <br />
fact from you. I will check with you repeatedly to ensure that you aren't losing your humanity and that you <br />
are not in pain.  If you fail to respond with the blink code - two blinks for no, three for yes - I will stop <br />
the changes at once, but I believe that you will find the experience as fascinating as I will.  And you have <br />
one opportunity, now, to tell me to stop.  I can reverse everything, but you would have to go through the <br />
entire three months of summer camp here, doing all their activities, and eating their food. So think about it <br />
for a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought about it. I really thought hard about it. This was at least different. Nothing fun, but it was a <br />
different kind of not-fun than the excruciating boredom, the nasty food, and the rest of it. Hell, I couldn't <br />
change it, and I know this might have been me feeling all Stockholm-Syndromey, but I was kind of interested in <br />
seeing what would happen. And so far, even with being naked in front of everyone, this was less horrible than <br />
the mandatory Talent Show last year. Nobody would believe my &quot;What I Did This Summer&quot; essay, but then they <br />
never did.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Hector was back in my face. &quot;What do you say? Blink twice to be reverted, three times to continue as <br />
my experimental ... subject.&quot;  He was clearly thinking 'victim' but I didn't care. I blinked twice, then a <br />
third time.  What the heck, right?  He smiled for real, the first actual human non-robot-like expression I'd <br />
seen from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Excellent! Thank you! You won't be sorry, I promise.&quot;  He moved back into the blurry distance and I <br />
wondered what I had gotten myself into. But he was out of sight and I couldn't hear him. I felt a little <br />
drowsy from the food and went to sleep for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
When I woke up the sun was finally warming me enough that I felt good. I could feel my body again, though I <br />
still couldn't move anything. Hector was humming some sort of classical music piece as he started fiddling <br />
around with something I couldn't see clearly.  He came close, and started to explain as he was working.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your change will be finished within two days.  It might take you three or four more days to learn how to move <br />
properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt a couple sharp pinches in each arm, and several around my legs and one, humiliatingly, in the space <br />
between my legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go. Now for a quick anatomy lesson on the squamates - that's the order that contains lizards, <br />
snakes, and worm lizards - so you won't be too surprised.  The sub-order serpentes in particular are seldom <br />
visibly different by gender.  Males and females look much the same from the outside. But, the males have <br />
something a bit different. Rather than a single external penis, they have two, called hemi-penes, and they are <br />
inverted into their bodies by a retractor muscle, or when they erect, they evert out into the outside. This <br />
change is the first one I am triggering, to protect you from what would otherwise be an excruciatingly painful <br />
experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wasn't sure about that at all, but then everything in my groinal area went all tingly. Not in a good way, <br />
more like pins-and-needles. There was a sharp hard tug as I felt my testicles pull painfully in, then a sort <br />
of tearing sensation. I started blinking rapidly, the closest thing I could come to screaming, but then the <br />
pain got really sharp, and then it stopped suddenly, and it felt numb, then I could feel the muscle that you <br />
can tense, the &quot;kegel&quot; muscle, pulling hard, and it felt like I was sliding into something.  I never thought <br />
it would feel like that. When it finished I wasn't sure how, but it felt a little like I had put on a condom <br />
or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; Hector said. He put his phone-camera up to my face where I could see it, and there was a movie, <br />
showing my personal favorite organ, getting hard, then my balls sort of suck up against it and Hector pushed <br />
on each of them, and there was a squelch that would have made me flinch if I could have, as they slid inside <br />
my body, then my penis turned inside out and sucked into my body as if it were 30 below zero. I knew it was <br />
still there, but it didn't show at all on the surface.  Hector took the camera display away, and grinned into <br />
my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You probably find me to be unbelievably perverse for saying this, but that is one of the most arousing things <br />
I've seen. It's going to be fascinating to see how your sexual response changes. You'll definitely remain <br />
male, don't worry, but there are things you can do now ... well, you will be able to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have to admit he was right.  He was a total pervert, and I was kind of bothered, but I figured it wasn't <br />
that bad.  But again how many people can turn someone into a snake.  Up til now I hadn't really believed it, <br />
but this was proof.  I was going to be a whatever-he-called it. Eunectes. Anaconda. I would be a snake for my <br />
birthday.<br />
<br />
Man. This was the last year my parents would be able to force me to come to this dump, but with Hector <br />
Poindexter's happy little needles, I wasn't sure if I was going to be leaving.</p>
