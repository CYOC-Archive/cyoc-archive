<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I can’t fucking believe this!” Jack Crawford was in a full blown rant. His carefully laid plans facing a serious setback thanks to Ella Alyn, outing his wife to public as a high priced escort agent. Knowing it could of come up, but figuring that the only person who knew was Kenya previous boyfriend; a teenage werewolf by the name of Nate Anderson. Yet he failed to realize that both he and Kenya were using their aliases during last year’s big social event at the Knight Estate. With his alias of Jack Ashford out in the open and Kenya’s, Kendra Smythe name now in the public domain, Jack Crawford had to rethink his plans.<br />
<br />
“First Benton Knight steals away my birth right,” Jack raving about Kenya’s house; “now his younger brother’s help has fuck me over royally!”<br />
“And what about me,” a sobbing voice could be heard in the next room.<br />
Jack turns around to see his wife in her were-panthress fursona crying. Holding in her paws the scroll Tachibana gave her earlier; a summons ordering her to appear before the Elder Council tomorrow. Jack Crawford also was handed one as well.<br />
“I wanted to be somebody,” Kenya sobbing; “a person in power and prominence.”<br />
“You are,” Jack sitting next to Kenya; giving the were-panthress a loving embrace as he takes the scroll and tosses it away. “And the day is not yet over,” Jack doing his best to wipe away the tear’s off of Kenya’s fur; “there is always plan B.”<br />
“Plans,” Kenya growling as she gets up; “you and your plans. A plan for this,” Kenya grabbing a bunch of documents from Jack’s open briefcase and tossing them about. “Plans for that,” Kenya tossing a newspaper outlining the delays to the new elementary school; “all you do is plan. I want action.”<br />
“You can’t just wing these things,” Jack shaking his head; “it’s akin to a game of chess, you have to plan your strategy.”<br />
“So I’m a pawn,” Kenya growling; “someone to sacrifice at a moment’s notice?”<br />
“No,” Jack regretting the metaphor; “you are my queen. And a queen is the most powerful piece on a chess board,” Jack removing his clothes; “Riley and Arnold, they were pawns, ready to be disposed of in a moment’s notice.”<br />
<br />
Kenya watches as her husband strips off his clothes; shifting into his black furred were-panther fursona and approaching her. His paws situated around her furry waist as she feels his member starting to poke her.<br />
“If I recall,” Jack speaking softly; “you still have an unbearable heat in need of quenching.”<br />
“Don’t change the subject,” Kenya allowing herself to be lead to the bed; “we still have to deal with this major blow up.”<br />
“I know,” Jack responding; “plus the Elder Council finally getting involved. Tachibana giving us those scrolls.”<br />
“The council may not have much influence outside of Moon Lake,” Kenya gasping as she feels her husband penetrate her and begin a slow rhythmic thrusting; “but to declare war with them while in Moon Lake…”<br />
“It’s a good thing we are heading back to Seattle tonight,” Jack growling; “I have no intention of appearing before those idiots. They have no sway over me.”<br />
<br />
Kenya was stunned at what Jack just said; wanting to warn him of the trouble he will face for ignoring or refusing a summons, she was unable to form words as her body betrayed her. Making her endure the state of bliss Jack put her in as she was being rutted; neither forcefully or gently, Kenya spent her energy just keeping in synch with Jack’s thrusting into her now slick canal. Moaning and yowling as she felt her body tense; the pleasure building and bubbling over, ready to break free.<br />
<br />
“Almost there,” Jack grunting; “I feel it coming.”<br />
“Oh Jack,” was all Kenya could muster; panting as she feels her husband’s barbed penis flex and dig in her. Twitching as she feels his seed explode in her; Kenya screams and moans as her body explodes in orgasmic joy. Lost in the moment, Kenya forgets what happened earlier; the reporter outing her as a hooker, the embarrassing left hook she received and Tachibana dropping a summons scroll. All Kenya felt at the moment was her husband embracing her and keeping her safe in his furry arms as she drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Jack watched as Kenya fell asleep; he grabs his phone that he placed at the nearby night stand. Electing not to speak, in fear it might wake Kenya up; Jack instead texts his driver to have the car ready for when they leave in a few hours.<br />
‘No council,’ Jack thinks to himself; ‘regardless if they are appointed or elected, tells me what to do.’<br />
Checking to make sure Kenya is still asleep; Jack composes another text message.<br />
‘N.A. is to miss school in the morning. Harm must be done to him tonight.’<br />
Satisfied, Jack hits send, unconcerned that the recipient of the message will soon have to deal with a bunch of angry were-lions before getting to Nate Anderson.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Arnold Steward Stevenson, former town council man and now ex-campaign manager for Kenya Adaeze-Crawford, sat in his car; holding onto the final draft for a speech Kenya was supposed to read. A speech outlining her campaign platform for mayor; a speech that will never be revealed, after Kenya was outed as an escort agent. Shaking his head as threw it onto the passenger seat of his car; Arnold was about to start up his vehicle and drive off, when a tap to his window directs him to look left.<br />
<br />
Standing outside of his car was Tachibana No Akane, holding onto a scroll with a red wax seal. Arnold knew what the scroll was and dreaded its contents as he rolled down the window.<br />
“Before to order me to appear before the council,” Arnold sighing; “know that I had no knowledge Kenya’s past… profession.”<br />
“Well the fact that I saw you quickly rip that pin off your lapel and leave,” Tachibana handing the scroll to Arnold; “attests to that. No this scroll is a summons for you to appear tomorrow and give testimony regarding your knowledge of Jack Crawford bugging Frances Twist office during her therapy sessions with a specific patient of hers.”<br />
<br />
Arnold’s face grew ashen over what Tachibana told him; tepidly taking the scroll from her as she makes an additional comment.<br />
“While I’m sure Mr. Crawford will deny the allegations,” Tachibana smiling; “when his helper Riley, who we have taken under our care after being abandoned by Jack speaks tomorrow; your former boss will have much to answer. Have a good day.”<br />
Arnold looked on stunned as he watches Tachibana walk away. Knowing that something happened to Riley a few days ago as he was unable to get ahold of the were-rat; Arnold had no idea that he was tortured by a couple of white were-tigers and then dropped the man off back at Jack’s condo.<br />
“Fuck this,” Arnold starting his car and driving off; “I’m not taking the fall for any of this. Jack is going to have more to answer for after I save my own skin first.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Roaming through the picnic grounds, the elder were-vixen smiles as she watches the various town folks enjoy themselves, despite the were-alert under effect. Continuing her stroll, Tachibana spots Frances Twist eating under a covered picnic table along with her lifer partner and to the were-vixen’s surprise, Frances’s parents.<br />
<br />
Overhearing them talk about Angelica’s current health issues; shaking her head as she overheard pancreatic cancer mentioned. Tachibana didn’t want to intrude but council business could not wait and the Twists needed to be informed of an important issue.<br />
<br />
“Frances Twist,” Tachibana approaching; “I hate to do this, but I need to give you this summons scroll.”<br />
Frances and everyone present look on shocked as Tachibana pulls out the small document sealed in red wax and hand it to the were-cat.<br />
“You’re not in trouble,” Tachibana sighing; “however you are an unknowing victim in a serious crime that came to light.”<br />
“Excuse me,” Frances looking stunned as she looks on at an apologetic Japanese woman; “what is this about?”<br />
“I would prefer to tell you in private,” Tachibana shaking her head; “or if you prefer, you can join me as I hand this scroll to Benton Knight, as he is also a victim in this crime that was recently perpetrated. That way I can explain it to you both.”</p>
