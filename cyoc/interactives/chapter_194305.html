<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh was practically tingling with excitement as he thought about the fantasy he was going to make real. His raging eighteen-year-old libido keeping him from considering the consequences of reshaping the world to match this particular sexual fantasy. He smiled as he spoke out loud for the first time the carefully constructed fantasy he&#39;d jerked off too so many times before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Women are seen as inherently lesser than men. Across almost all societies throughout the world, women are seen as less intelligent, less strong, less competent and less capable of handling responsibilities than men are. Most people will outright reject any evidence to the contrary. No one values the things a woman has to say or takes her opinions seriously, even other women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The two things which women are valued for in most societies are their abilities to provide sexual pleasure and to bear children. Specifically the ability to bear children, and not to raise them, because no one believes women are anywhere near smart, competent or responsible enough to properly care for a child (especially not for a son, who will need to be taught things everyone believes a woman isn&#39;t capable of understanding). Though it&#39;s not uncommon for a woman to help teach her daughter about a woman&#39;s role in society and how to properly fulfill it (and all that entails), but in situations like that the mother is seen as merely secondary to, or supportive of, her daughter&#39;s primary caretaker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh thought about the way he had phrased that for a second. When he&#39;d said primary caretaker he had meant the child&#39;s father, but given the rest of his plans for the worlds women, that might be a problem. &quot;If a woman gets pregnant and is able to find the man who impregnated her, it&#39;s common for the man to take in the child and become their primary caregiver Sometimes the mother will be involved in the child&#39;s life in some capacity, but just as often she won&#39;t be. It&#39;s equally common, however, that the woman is unable to find the father of a child she&#39;s carrying, or simply doesn&#39;t care to. In these instances, the mother will give her child to one of many orphanages, thus allowing the child&#39;s primary caregiver to be a man who she believes is more competent than her. These orphanages allow women to volunteer, although they&#39;re careful not to give female volunteers any important responsibilities. Sometimes the mothers of a child being raised by an orphanage will volunteer at it, although it&#39;s just as common (if not more common) for a woman to give her child to an orphanage and go right back to the life she had before she got pregnant. Because children being raised in orphanages or by single parents is so normalized, there is no stigma against either of these things and children are no worse off for either of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that detour out of the way, Josh was free to get back to focusing on the aspects of his fantasy world he was actually excited for, although he was now aware that he might need to pay more attention to some of the finer details.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because one of the only two things women are valued for is their ability to provide sexual pleasure, women are forbidden from wearing any type of clothing. As a result no one makes clothing for women. Women are nude at all times.&quot; Josh paused for a second to consider the logistical issues. He would need to come up with a way to allow women to deal with the level of environmental exposure they would have. &quot;Women are able to be nude at all times, and even in extreme weather conditions, because of two things.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;One: While women&#39;s skin is naturally softer and smoother than men&#39;s, it&#39;s also much, much more durable, providing women naturally with the kind of protection men need specialized gear for. This also applies to women&#39;s eyes and any other part of their body that&#39;s exposed to the air.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Two: Women have variable body temperatures. Whenever a woman enters into an environment, her body temperature will automatically raise or lower over a course of fifteen minutes to an hour allowing her to be both comfortable and perfectly safe in all but the most extreme temperatures. Because of this variable body temperature, women also burn calories in a different way than men do. The way women burn calories makes it almost impossible for them to develop excess fat anywhere except their breasts, hips, thighs and asses. This causes all women to be incredibly sexy. This also means women have no need for body hair, so women have no hair follicles anywhere except their eyebrows and scalp. And women&#39;s unique metabolisms have a side effect of making all external signs of aging stop somewhere between thirty and forty years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh patted himself on the back for that one. Not only had he come up with a way to allow women to go naked all the time all around the world, he&#39;d also managed use the same answer to keep women from ever being old or unattractive. And while he was changing women&#39;s biology, why not replace the worst part of it with something more fun?<br />
<br />
&quot;Women don&#39;t have a menstrual cycle. Instead they have mammalian heat cycles. Five times a year a woman will go into a state of complete, overwhelming horniness and she&#39;ll be nearly unable to think about anything other than sex for somewhere between a few days and a week, depending on a number of factors. Every woman&#39;s cycle is unique to her in regards to when she goes into heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since they&#39;re considered so inferior to men and generally incompetent, women are legally forbidden from getting jobs as anything except sex workers. Companies get-around-slash-take-advantage-of this by using a loophole. They create specific jobs for women that involve sex work on top of, or instead of, the regular work male employees do. A man can go to a restaurant and order a blowjob from the waitress, the pregnant barista can serve a latte with her breast milk in it, the manager at an office job can hire a woman to be the office cum dumpster, et cetera.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Consent is a matter of practicality and not necessity. Since women are only seen as valuable for being able to bear children or provide sexual pleasure, it&#39;s completely accepted and expected that anyone can simply use any woman&#39;s body for pleasure whenever and however they like. If someone wants to grope a woman, or rub any part of their body on any part of hers, or if a man just wants to jerk off onto her, those things are all considered totally acceptable and it&#39;s considered unnecessary to ask the woman&#39;s permission. Many women will even actively do their best to help someone who&#39;s trying to use their body to get off.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The only sex acts that are seen as needing a woman&#39;s consent are penetrative ones, or ones where the woman absolutely needs to be an active participant. This is mostly just about being practical, it&#39;s simply easier to fuck a woman in the ass or get a handjob if the woman is aware that&#39;s what someone wants. Although it is seen as rude to penetrate a woman with anything more than fingers without getting her permission first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Similarly, the concept of monogamy simply doesn&#39;t exist. People believe women are meant to be used for pleasure, and the idea of one man trying to keep any woman all to himself would be seen as simply preposterous to anyone who heard it. It&#39;s also seen as completely normal to engage in any and all sex acts in public.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Women, especially, believe in this gender hierarchy. They believe just as, if not more strongly than men do that men are superior to them in almost every way. That the only things that make them valuable as women are their abilities to provide sexual pleasure and to bear children. Women firmly, honestly believe that women are simple silly things that are just too incompetent to handle anything important. They&#39;ll happily defer to any man when it comes to making decisions, because they completely believe that men are just better at that kind of thing. They&#39;re also just as quick to dismiss any woman&#39;s opinions or feelings as any man is, even their own. If any woman was otherwise demonstrably smarter or more capable than any man, she would never notice it, because the very idea of such a thing just seems that impossible to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he closed his eyes and uncrossed his fingers, ready for his fantasy world to take shape around him.</p>
