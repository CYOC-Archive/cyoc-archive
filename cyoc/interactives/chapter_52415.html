<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So Tyler,&quot; his twin sneered at him. &quot;Do you still have a boyhood crush on Jeanette?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeanette chimed in and then asked, &quot;And is it true that both your mother and your sister have caught you wanking off to a picture of me you took from the year-book?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angered, knowing the last accusation wasn't true, Tyler looked at his sister and told her, &quot;Taylor, you and your friends can be a couple of bitches sometimes,&quot; and then turning away from the living room where Taylor, Jeanette and Mandy where sitting around, giggling, gushing and weeping over what he thought of as a really stupid movie.<br />
<br />
Behind him, Taylor called, &quot;I'm telling mom that you were swearing and you called us rude name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Tyler snapped. &quot;It still doesn't change the truth,&quot; and then, grabbing his sneakers, he stormed out of the house and began to walk in any direction that he felt like, thinking dark thoughts about his twin sister.<br />
<br />
Wandering, he eventually ambled into the park and sitting down on a park bench, staring out at the lake, still thinking dark thoughts about Taylor - as well as her friends - he almost missed the folded piece of paper blowing about. But when he saw that it had his name on it, he jumped after it, catching it rather easily.<br />
<br />
Sitting back down, Tyler unfolded the note and read: 'You are unhappy with someone in your life. Do you ever wish that you could do something about that?<br />
<br />
'Do you wish they could be someone or something else entirely? Feel like a little revenge should be served up? Well, all you have to do is write down your wish and no matter how small, how large, complex or even ridiculous it may sound, just make it as detailed as you want and you are guaranteed the wish you have just made. And then, sit back and watch as your wish is full-filled.<br />
<br />
'Unhappy with the wish? The answer is simple - Tear up this note and everything will revert back to the way it was before the wish was ever made. Note: You, and only you, will be aware of any changes. The world will continue, having no knowledge of any changes. You are only granted one wish, so wish carefully'<br />
<br />
Staring at the note, thinking this had to be some sort of cruel joke Taylor would cook up, he almost crumpled the note up and tossed it away and then, having second thoughts, he folded it back up, placed it in his pocket and started for home.<br />
<br />
Home, he noted that Taylor and her friends had left somewhere and that mom and dad weren't home yet. Hoping that Taylor forgot to narc on him, Tyler headed for his room and sitting down at his desk, he unfolded the note, took a pen from the cup and rereading the note, he asked himself, &quot;What would I wish for? Something that involves Taylor, that's for sure.&quot; a pause and then he said to himself, &quot;Something that would teach her a lesson and maybe open her eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
An idea formed and looking back at the note, rereading yet again, Tyler wrote, 'I wish that my twin sister Taylor would get a life lesson on how another person lives. How another person views the world. How another person goes through their life.<br />
<br />
'I wish that my twin sister Taylor could see and understand the world as I do. And to make it fair, I would also be able to see and understand the world as she does.'<br />
<br />
Pausing, scanning what he wrote, hoping it sounded like that all that would happen would be Taylor and him switching minds, he added, 'She would be completely unaware or how she previously saw and understood the world, while I would be aware of both mine and her understandings, though her views and understandings would be the dominant pairing. This is my wish, please make it come true.'<br />
<br />
Folding the note, Tyler sat back and wondering, &quot;If this is for real, how long does it take for the note to activate my wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing, he thought, &quot;Maybe I have to do something to make it begin,&quot; and then folding the note, he exited his room and made his down the hall and toward Taylor's room.<br />
<br />
Inside, he looked about, taking in the boy bands pictures, the posters of what Tyler thought Taylor must think of as cute guys. &quot;Though some of them are actually kind of sexy,&quot; Tyler told himself and then blinking, he thought, &quot;Where did that thought come from,&quot; as he set the note down on Taylor's vanity.<br />
<br />
Opening the dresser, taking out one of Taylor's bras and then a pair of underwear, not understanding what a thong was - which was all Taylor wore - Tyler walked over to the mirror and looking in, he announced, &quot;I think I'm so great because I can wear clothes that look like this.&quot; and then, before he could some and think about what he was saying, Tyler announced, &quot;Actually I wear clothes like this because they are really revealing, scantily cladding my body and showing off my femininity in just the right way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping the garments as if he had just been scalded, Tyler thought, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as he cast a nervous look around the room.<br />
<br />
Sighing, telling himself, &quot;Get a grip,&quot; he figured he would try something else and if the outcome was still the same, he would leave, &quot;And possibly tear up the note as well,&quot; Tyler thought as he opened his sister's closet.<br />
<br />
Inside, he looked at the various shoes, nightshirts, dresses, pantyhose and other assortment of odds and ends Taylor kept in her closet. Breathing in the smell of something that had a rich, sweet smell to it, Tyler selected one of Taylor's sundresses and then exiting the closet, he stood once again in front of his sister's mirror.<br />
<br />
And then, just as he was about to say something, he changed his mind and turning about, he walked across the room, shut the door and then slowly began to undress.<br />
<br />
Nude, he picked up the thong from were he had dropped it and tucking his penis and testicles back between his legs, he pulled the thong on, liking suddenly how it hugged his body and just barely covered anything up in the front.<br />
<br />
Next, he pulled on the white sundress, really liking the way it felt against his body and thinking the blue-floral print on the lower half was kind of cute. Looking back into the mirror, noting that he looked even more like his twin sister - although with a flatter chest - Tyler opened his mouth to make a comment, but instead cried out, &quot;No! This is all wrong. I don't want to wear my sister's clothes. I'm not a pervert. I need to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Crossing the room, he picked up his clothes and stared at them. After a bit, he thought, &quot;Damn you Tyler. Why are your clothes in my room,&quot; and then opening the bedroom door, he stormed down the hall and tossed the clothes in his room, just missing the laundry basket by a couple inches.<br />
<br />
Confused suddenly, Tyler looked at the room, took in everything before him and then, gently brushing a hand against the dress he was wearing, he turned and headed back to Taylor's room.<br />
<br />
Inside, he shut the door and clicking on the ceiling fan, thought, &quot;Think I'll have a nap before I am supposed to meet Jeanette and Mandy at the mall,&quot; and the lying down on his sister's bed, Tyler snuggled underneath the sheets and within moments was asleep, completely unaware of what was happening to him for the moment.</p>
