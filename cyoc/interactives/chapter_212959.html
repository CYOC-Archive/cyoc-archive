<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The small engineer looks up at you, &quot;Well allow you to introduce myself. I&#39;m Pete, perhaps we should go to my place, it&#39;s a bit more private than here&quot;. You nod and the small figure runs off down a hallway. Since you are somewhat bigger you can easily follow him around some dimly lit corridors with a fairly smooth ground. The walls are somewhat more cave like, clearly chiselled into the rock. A spaghetti mess of wires and pipes runs across much of its ceiling and walls. Eventually Pete stops and gets out a little portable device. After pressing a button the door slides open and you follow Pete into the room.<br />
<br />
Pete&#39;s room is somewhat messy, but something tells you that&#39;s the norm around here. On two sides there&#39;s a shelf of various mechanical and electronic contraptions, most of which look like they came straight from a junk-yard. On yet another side there&#39;s a modified bunk bed. Only the upper bunk is still a bed, the lower one has been converted into a work-bench. On the wall by the door there&#39;s a computer console. Pete leaps into one of the shelves to climb up to reach the console. Eagerly he pushes some buttons and a monitor turns on it shows a feed from Don&#39;s quarters. They are somewhat larger and include multiple rooms all decorated somewhat more lavishly. There was no sound but Don could be seen helping the living golden wolf statue who had previously been one of his henchmen to drink a large bottle of rum.<br />
<br />
Unsure what to make of this situation you ask Pete, &quot;Well you don&#39;t seem to be bothered by your shrinkage.&quot; Pete shrugs and responds, &quot;Well you don&#39;t seem to be bothered with your changes.&quot;<br />
You are confused, &quot;Well I was in control of that change. I wanted to be a plane.&quot;. Pete responds, &quot;No I meant the change to your mind!&quot; &quot;To my mind&quot;, you respond even more puzzled. &quot;Remember when you blacked out &quot;To my mind&quot;, you respond even more puzzled. &quot;Remember when you blacked out  &quot;To my mind&quot;, you respond even more puzzled. &quot;Remember when you blacked out  &quot;To my mind&quot;,<br />
you respond even more puzzled. &quot;Remember when you blacked out. That&#39;s when I changed your mind to try to impress Don.&quot;                                                                       <br />
You think for a moment and realize that Pete was right, &quot;So you did change me. Hmm, I&#39;ll show him...&quot;                                                                                        <br />
<br />
Meanwhile on the screen Don pulled down the golden statue pirate&#39;s pants and puts a bucket in front of him. He instructs the noticably drunken statue to urinate into it, which is did, peeing liquid gold into the bucket. Don visibly was giddy with joy as the bucket filled with actual gold solidifying shortly after reaching the bucket.                                           <br />
<br />
Pete suggested, &quot;Well we could turn him into a robot... under our control&quot;. The genie, who also followed them somehow unnoticed by anyone, thought for a bit, &quot;Well that certainly would work. Shall I do so?&quot;, she asked you. You nod at her and she starts working.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the statue filled the bucket and Don tried to move it. Since it was filled with solid gold the handle broke of immediately and Don was barely able to move the bucket. Unbeknownst to them the changes already started. As Don got out of his pants, his legs already changed to mechanical versions of themselves. Up to the knees they looked like he&#39;d be wearing a sort of mechanical armor with metallic boots with thick rubber soles covering even the middle part of his toes. The rest seemed to be covered with black rubber at the joints and dull blue metal up to his knees. Gradually the changes spread upwards and unperturbed by the changes Don started to stroke the statues member, his own was clearly erect. Gradually the inside of his thighs changed into thick black rubber. The outside formed into dull blue metal plates protecting his legs. As the statue started to pre-cum gold, Don&#39;s crotch stared to turn into metal. His ball-sack turned into a rectangular box from whichs top his telescopic metal member emerged. It was painted crimson red, as it fully formed he thrusted it into the statue which visibly winced and trembled, then using his new legs he thrusted his member in and out of the statue. In his ecstasy he didn&#39;t notice the changes going up his body. His coat merged with his body, seemingly becoming plates of blue metal except at his back where it appeared to be made out of blue leather or rubber. His hands changed from gloves which could barely withstand the heat of the statues glistening member to nimble yet durable armor plated mechanical hands. His arms also changed into metal plated versions of themselves like his legs, but in a much more vibrant shade of blue. His head showed an expression of sexual bliss. Apparently he was still capable of enjoying the situation, as the changes reached it. At first his eyes changed. They were already closed, but somehow seized up and changed into a sort of visor. His hat changed to metal and combined with his hat. His mouth closed and smoothed out before bulging forward a bit like a mask. This completed his transformation into a robot. As he noticed that the statue was ejaculating his last shot, he realized that his goal was reached and he could stop pistoning into him. It seemed like the logical thing to him. In front of both of them there were nuggets of pure gold, the result of their exercise, in front of them. <br />
<br />
Don quickly retracted his red mechanical member and stood up. He was now a robotic version of himself. His eyes were piercing red lights in a dark visor mimicking goggles. His mouth looked like a mask. He was still a rather cunning and imposing figure. His armored plates still held a sort of belt from which his cutlass hung. <br />
<br />
&quot;So he&#39;s a robot now?&quot;, you ask. The genie replied, &quot;Yes and obviously he has to obey orders and suggestions from both of you.&quot;</p>
