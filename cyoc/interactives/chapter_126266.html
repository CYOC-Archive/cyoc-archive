<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: Sorry for the week long hiatus. I have to deal with college exams for both this week and next week. But I can&#39;t just leave this story standing after it has gotten so far. <br />
<br />
P.S: Welcome back iWTBAT!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac struggles to keep himself from drowning in lust. He could feel the straps weaken as his dark armor absorbs the corruption. Usually, that would be a good thing, but this time, the added corruption made Dark Isaac stronger. The red gem adorned on Isaac&#39;s Halo radiated a brilliant red as the two mentally fight. But this time, Dark Isaac was winning the fight.<br />
<br />
But before Isaac loses himself, he thought back at the visions the oracle mirror showed him. The vision were he became a dragoness implied that corrupt creatures can communicate each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m already corrupt! Let me go and we will negotiate our passage!&quot; Isaac shouted. <br />
<br />
The mummy showed no signs of responding. Isaac heard something, but he could only make out murmurs. Whatever humanity that corpse had is buried too deeply for him to communicate with. All that Isaac could sense from the mummy was his burning millennium-long desire to experience pleasure. Isaac could only pant as his lust demon resilience was struggling against the mummy&#39;s overwhelming aura. He could already feel his metal cock pouch slowly open up, revealing the growing baby inside.<br />
<br />
Time for plan C. Hope for Nat to save him from himself. But as he watched Nat&#39;s movement and body language, he noticed that she seems to be avoiding him and not really aiming. <br />
<br />
Isaac was fading fast. &quot;Nat! Don&#39;t worry about me! My armor should protect me from the fire! Just worry about burning this monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
The red gem floating out of harms way glows a almost blinding shade of red as Isaac focuses on fighting Dark Isaac instead of the living corpse. <br />
<br />
Nat can&#39;t believe  she forgot about Isaac&#39;s armor. Feeling her doubt drain away, she prepared another fire ball spell.<br />
<br />
“IGNIRA! IGNIRA! IGNIRA!”<br />
<br />
Just like her fight with the air dragon, she fired about a dozen fire balls at the mummy. <br />
<br />
However, Just like what Nat feared, the mummy used Isaac as a shield. What Nat didn&#39;t expect however was that the mummy was able to block each and every fireball  with Isaac&#39;s body. Despite being weakened, the mummy&#39;s strength and agility was enough to use Isaac as a man sized shield. The mummy wasn&#39;t even hit by a spark.<br />
<br />
But something strange was happening. Every time one of Nat&#39;s fire balls hit Isaac, some of the fire stays on him. It&#39;s as if his armor was absorbing the magic! <br />
<br />
Isaac was surprised by this development, but after some thought, it makes some level of sense. Nathan the Human Sorcerer once mentioned that Magic is the art of taking the laws of reality from another world and applying it to the world you&#39;re currently in. Corruption is not much different in the respect, it&#39;s really just the way the body works in different worlds. It&#39;s just that some creatures can transfer their essence to others through sexual intercourse. So of course his enhanced armor can channel the power Nat&#39;s fire magic! Though the difference between magic and corruption is that magic only exists in the world so as long the user has the energy to sustain it. As soon as Isaac loses his strength, his temporary fire armor will run out.<br />
<br />
Isaac took advantage of this and grabbed the straps wrapping him and ripping them off the mummy. The fire combined with the fact that his dark armor was absorbing the mummy&#39;s essence while he was wrapped made getting free really easy. <br />
<br />
But getting free didn&#39;t come without a price. While Isaac was distracted by the mummy, Dark Isaac took the opportunity to take control of Isaac&#39;s body! Through sheer focus, Dark Isaac was able to over power Isaac and knock him into the black mental void that Ilivir occupied.<br />
<br />
Nat watched in fear as Isaac&#39;s eyes glowed a eerie and sickening purple. Just like the mummy&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac let out a sick grin as he finally got control of Isaac body! But first things first. He released his glorious cocks from their metal prism and into the world. But he then noticed in disgust as the corrupted air dragon spawn was sucking off his cocks. It&#39;s one of the reasons Isaac became as sexually sated as he was. But not anymore. He doesn&#39;t need some kind of leach hogging all his glorious cum to himself.<br />
<br />
So he materialized a metal blade from his gauntlet.  He made attempt to stab the dragon, but the spawn has developed enough to jump off his cock and in front of Nat.<br />
<br />
But Dark Isaac wasn&#39;t concerned. He has a mummy to rape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you little guy?&quot; Nat couldn&#39;t help but pet the little dragon. The dragon seems to like her too. It chirped in liking.<br />
<br />
But before Nat and her new found friend could get acquainted, she watch in absolute horror as dark Isaac took the mummy&#39;s mouth and started mouth fuking it. The mummy screamed in pain and pleasure as purple crystals formed all over it&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Nat couldn&#39;t help but feel queasy by the sight of Isaac&#39;s twin cocks converts the mummy.<br />
<br />
As Dark Isaac forced the mummy to suck him off, he could feel the mummy&#39;s essence going into Dark Isaac&#39;s body and the Lust Demon&#39;s corruption going into the mummy.<br />
<br />
As Dark Isaac absorbed the mummy&#39;s essence, he also gained some of it&#39;s memories.<br />
<br />
Apparently, he was once a pharaoh, A king among his people. That was until he his people has unearth a strange piece of glass underneath the sands. The glass was crafted into a artifact known as the the Eye of Thoth. It was said to send it&#39;s user messages from the gods. But as soon as his people presented the eye as a gift, things went downhill from there. He quickly realized that the eye has the power to show him possible pasts and futures and he used that to his advantage to mold his people to his will. Over the years,  he grew corrupt and it gotten to the point to were he &quot;uses&quot; his servants behind the scenes. luckily for the people, he died as a young man before he can do any real damage. Many centuries has passed and the eye has kept his spirit alive. He was eventually released from his tomb but by then he only cared about feeling pleasure again. He wrecked havoc all over Egypt until the witch has captured him and trapped him in these catacombs.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac had little interest in the new, fractured memories, but the piece of information were the witch had sealed the mummy in this place has intrigued him. He decided to keep a mental note of that for later.<br />
<br />
When Dark Isaac was done, the mummy became a converted creature of Purple crystal, or rather a lust mummy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up.&quot; Dark Isaac commanded. The newly converted mummy did so.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac turned around to face Nat and the Air Dragon Spawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re next little Nat.&quot; Dark Isaac Promised.</p>
