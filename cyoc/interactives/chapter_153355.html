<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maxchel and Lucy are surprised with a drink being offered to them by the bar tender.<br />
<br />
What&#39;s this?<br />
<br />
A secret admirer is sending you your first drink.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t a first drink. All night long the drinks flowed to the point that soon Maxchel was wobbling on her high heels and as she was on the dance floor when she turned and fell into the arms of the most hansom man she had ever seen in her life. Or maybe that was the alcohol talking.<br />
<br />
The night ended there and when she woke the next morning she was at her home listing to a buzz saw sleeping next to her.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m Dean the buzz saw said. We met last night. You were quite charming.<br />
<br />
Maxchel looked at this man. He was probably 5&#39;4&quot; very short and close to 350 pounds. I didn&#39;t think you liked me but when you fell on me on the dance floor and looked up at me with those bedroom eyes and said you loved me and that I was the sexiest thing you had seen in your life I can&#39;t tell you how flattered I was with you.<br />
<br />
But but how did we get here.<br />
<br />
Don&#39;t you remember? You said you wanted to go back to your place. I knew you had a few drinks but... oh god were you drunk? You seemed fine. I am so sorry I wouldn&#39;t have done this if I knew you were toasted. Please forgive me.<br />
<br />
No no it was just as much my fault as it was yours. If I hadn&#39;t taken that first drink and all the others my inhibitions would have probably not made me do this.<br />
<br />
Thank you I didn&#39;t mean for anything to happen I was just so flattered.<br />
<br />
Now he wasn&#39;t the ugliest person in the world but definitely not someone Maxchel would have hooked up with.<br />
<br />
Look  I will get out of here and I am sorry again. But if you want to talk about it here is my card.<br />
<br />
Maxchel looked at the card and it appeared as if he were quite a wealthy investment banker. Still not her cup of tea.<br />
<br />
As they parted ways Max found some of her old clothes to change back into the man she once was. But as she tried to change nothing happened. It was at that point that she had a dreadful thought. She immediately went to the Dr and found out she was pregnant. The medallion wouldn&#39;t let her change back until she had the baby and the stockings she had made her particularly fertile having come from this formerly pregnant ex girlfriend.<br />
<br />
It was at that point that Maxchel picked up the card. She hadn&#39;t planned on calling him. This was her problem and she would just be this girl until she had the baby. But he had a right to know. He had seemed like such a nice person so she gave him a call and told him she needed to talk to him.<br />
<br />
She laid out the situation that she was pregnant and it was probably his baby. She knew it was but she couldn&#39;t tell him about the medallion so she just let him know she was pregnant and they needed to get tested.<br />
<br />
As soon as they were able they did test and of course it showed he was the father. He had her move in with him so he could help with the baby. Pamper her. And give her all she needed.<br />
<br />
Soon the baby came and the boy came home with the parents. Now Maxchel was exhausted and decided she would take some time before she abandoned them and made the change back. But one particular night Maxchel got extremely drunk once again and seduced Dean once again and she was once again pregnant again.<br />
<br />
She knew she had to stick it out again and when the day came they had another boy. They were both obviously his. They looked just like him. Now Maxchel didn&#39;t plan on going through this again and left one day to change back. But the Medallion was gone. She looked for a week and couldn&#39;t find it not knowing that Lucy had stolen it and was not going to give it back.<br />
<br />
When she went back to Dean&#39;s and explained that she had a panic attack and for him to forgive her he dropped to one knee pulled out a ring and proposed to her that moment.<br />
<br />
How could she do any better than this loving rich man so she accepted and that night was once again pregnant again. <br />
<br />
It was amazing that all their babies were boys. Perhaps it was the Medallion, perhaps it was Dean&#39;s masculinity, or perhaps it was that Maxchel was once male too but there was not one girl in the family except Maxchel.</p>
