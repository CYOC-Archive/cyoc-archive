<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You got to be kidding,&quot; Kat said, she giving her comment to what her own mother stated was needed for her to do to free Dan of his becoming degraded into a common farm animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Katherine, I am not kidding, as you might be kidding, or having kids, baby goats from your mating with buck goats. Even a Satyress, if you were to become as one, can have offspring, and mated by a horny buck will ensure you will bear forth kids and not children. You got yourself into this pickle of a problem, and by all that is right and true, I as your mother is going to make you pay the piper for your evil deed.&quot; One angry mother and a power wheeling witch said to her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, reason with Mom, this is not right, I do not want to have sex with my brother, goat or not, that is incest, its a crime, you do not want me to go to jail for any such perverted...&quot; Kat said, as her mother turned to look at her husband, he being the one parent who too often coddled Katherine and spoiled her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Witchery and witchcraft got you into this mess, it seems that your mother knows of how and what is best for all considering...&quot; Dear ole Dad said, as he knew never to argue against his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naa-baa dah-baa,&quot; Dan bleating tried to say something he wished all there to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel is disagreeing with you dear,&quot; Mom said, &quot;He wants some of what he had or could do to be a part of his needing now to live as would a buck goat. You gathered I hope, that Dan, our son is to live his life being a buck goat. Although he knows still of who he was, and of what Katherine made of him to be, he is more a goat than he is his human self.<br />
<br />
As I had a friend who became infatuated with a commoner, a non-magical man, and to save him from the horrors of a demanding witch mother-in-law, the dear man asked as choose for his then wife to make him a buck goat satyr. Her mother learned of the plan how to hide the fellow, and she intervened, changing the outcome. My friend was then the loving wife of a large breed, India type Beetal buck goat. <br />
<br />
She, my friend tended to defy her mother, and kept her goat husband as being her husband and a regular lover. His tall stance and equally long cock added to their troubles. Her mother had a prestigious devil familiar, and he acted in her account, as caused her daughter to begin becoming a Satyress due to her making love with her buck husband.<br />
<br />
Do not try to defy me, as much as you are my daughter too, you have doomed my son to being a beast. So understand this, as I said, Dan is more a goat than he is a human of mind. He shall if a doe goat were to flag her tail at him, he will do the mating rituals as common of a buck goat. I know that you and dad here are ignorant of exactly what happens between goats when they feel the need to mate.   <br />
<br />
Does will flag their tails when they need to urinate. This act draws the buck closer, as he then will reciprocate by ducking his head low and he gaining an erection, will urinate on his beard, forelegs, and the peak of his head as to draw the doe closer to him. When he goes to sniff her rump as check her pheromones, she will urinate on his muzzle. Then the buck will raise his head skyward and take deep inhaled breaths of the rank scented urine. As after that the chase is no for the buck to mount and mate with the doe goat not once, but maybe several quick as short thrilled times until he feels satisfied.<br />
<br />
Doe goats, and as well even a Satyress go into heat every twenty-one days, as seasons do not matter. Satyress types tend to prefer mating with male humans, but in a pinch, even a horny buck goat will do them to feeling as used. As women make love, and goat or animal feel the urge to breed, a Satyress more times than not become nymphomaniacs. <br />
<br />
Katherine, understand what happens to you, if you were to become a Satyress. Primary in your every thought is to want, or need sex. Sexual sensations are all you can think about, and no matter of how many times you mate with men or male animals, the urge remains as intense or gets worse. I read of some such a woman having become a victim of similar an accursed life, that she in pleading for release from her woes, cried, &quot;&#39;Please, don&#39;t leave me like this!  You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like...Ugg...ah...!   I cannot take this anymore! Oh...ah..., Ugg, please no more..., my lover won&#39;t stop, and I...I can&#39;t...stop... my orgasms! And she wailed left in her doom where the pleasure would never cease or be eased.<br />
<br />
Being a goat is a bad existence for someone who was born a man and had endeavors of doing something with his life more-so than to mate and breed with doe goats. As are those who become a Satyress, as they can do or think of nothing more than to feel a big cock stretching their vagina. So when you said I was kidding, you never knew that it will be you who shall do the kidding by having kids, satyrs and Satyress offspring, but not being grandchildren to your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
That said and Katherine had the look on her face as if she had someone slap her dumbfounded. Dan began to react as if aroused, he gaining an erection and stepped closer to Kat, ducking his head to place his muzzle close to her butt.<br />
<br />
One disgusted father, husband, and Dad turned his back on what began that day being his family and he walked out of the bedroom, down the hall, and entered his bedroom, closing the door as slamming it shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough said,&quot; Mom stated, &quot;As Katherine, you shall go first and prepare a place in a stall for your goaty brother to mate with you, I shall send Daniel along in a few minutes.&quot;</p>
