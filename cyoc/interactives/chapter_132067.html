<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tuesday morning I woke to the alarm. I tried to think what I needed to do today. I went to the toilet and changed my pad. It was quite soaked. I decided I had better put a heavy duty pad in today.  I also decided that today I would where some sensible clothes and shoes. Another outfit Sarah had suggested for work was a white short sleeved shirt and a tan pleated skirt that came to just below my knees. She had suggested I should where a white slip under the shirt as it was a thin material. I matched them with some tan shoes that only had a 1 inch heel. I lay all the clothes out on my bed. Including a  white bra and panty set that matched the lacy pattern of the slip.<br />
<br />
I showered and washed my hair again. Wearing my dressing gown I dried my hair and styled it to as close as I could get to how I had it at the job interview. I dressed and went down to breakfast, feeling very feminine. Mum and Dad were both there having breakfast. Dad commented that I looked very nice. <br />
<br />
Mum said &quot;I haven&#39;t seen that skirt before. Where did you find it?&quot;<br />
<br />
What do I say? &quot;I bought it online. It&#39;s nice isn&#39;t it&quot;<br />
<br />
Mum commented &quot;It is very nice Jenna, but be careful not to spend more than you earn. Remember you need to pay rent to Sarah for the car and now that you are earning it would be nice if you paid a bit of board&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much do you think would be fair&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I realize you are not on big money. How about $100 per week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fair. I haven&#39;t been paid yet though&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps I could help you prepare a budget? Start thinking about it. But we will leave it for now, maybe after the funeral and your court date&quot;.............&quot;And I would recommend pantyhose with that outfit&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mum&quot;<br />
<br />
I finished breakfast and made myself a cut lunch. Then returned to the bedroom and put on some nude pantyhose. Personally I didn&#39;t see the need but I wasn&#39;t going to argue with Mum. I applied my make=up happy to see my sunburn had faded. Then some stud earrings and a gold bangle. I decided I would head off to work. I still needed to prove my work ethic and arriving early wouldn&#39;t do any harm.<br />
........<br />
I arrived at work at 8.15m, the door was open. Millicent was inside tidying up the waiting room. I told her &quot;Good morning Millicent. You shouldn&#39;t be doing that. Let me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Thanks Jenna. And Good morning to you.........Have you any news on Sarah&#39;s fiance?&quot;<br />
<br />
I realized I had not updated her yesterday. &quot;Unfortunately they turned off the life support yesterday. Mum&#39;s helping to organize the funeral, hopefully next Monday&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s horrible. Did you know Rod well? How is Sarah coping?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was really nice. It&#39;s hard to imagine him no longer around. Sarah is pretty devastated, as you might expect&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I must try and get to the funeral. Was Rod from a big family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No just him and his Mum&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How horrible for her. Let me know as soon as the funeral details are sorted out. You take that whole day off&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t want to leave you short staffed&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna you have already shown enough that we will keep you on for the 6 months. Don&#39;t be concerned about your job&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Millicent&quot;<br />
............<br />
The day passed quickly. Everyone was sympathetic about Rod. At lunch time I walked across to the shopping center and bought a new 3 month supply of Yasmin. I also visited the post office but Jenna&#39;s key was not from there. I showed the key to the shop staff. The fellow suggested it was from a post office in the suburb near Dr Richards practice.<br />
<br />
Today it was my turn to babysit. A 6 month old was left sleeping in the reception area while Millicent treated her Mum, a blonde like me. She woke up and I ended up giving her cuddles to stop her from crying. The baby was very interested in my breasts  and gave me quite a feel, obviously not understanding why I didn&#39;t open up and give her a feed. I realized my nipples were erect, just from the thought of them been sucked.<br />
<br />
I had an opportunity to give Sarah a quick call mid afternoon. She was coping. Hilda and Mum had done most of the funeral organization. It would be next Monday at 11am at St Michaels followed by a gathering in the parish hall. <br />
<br />
I passed on the details to Millicent. She asked me to cancel her appointments between 10 and 2 for next Monday. That kept me busy. We were able to shuffle the patients into spare slots over the next week.<br />
<br />
After 5 I left work and went to check out the possible location of my post office box. I found the boxes and my key worked. There were 3 cards to collect parcels inside. Unfortunately the actual Post office was closed. I would have to return between 8 and 5.30. I had missed by only 5 minutes. I decided to return here tomorrow morning right on 8. That should give me time to collect the parcels and get to work by 8.30.<br />
<br />
The phone rang as  was walking back to the car. ”Hi Shaz”<br />
<br />
“You never rang me. How was Bigboy?” <br />
<br />
“About to be married. They were in town for his bucks party” <br />
<br />
Ohh…… When did you find out?”<br />
<br />
“In his room, clad in just my G-String”<br />
<br />
She giggled “So Yay or Nay?”<br />
<br />
“Nay. He wasn’t honest with me. What about yourself?”<br />
<br />
“Gabby and myself left not long after. No good. Em was happy though”<br />
<br />
“I saw her as I was leaving the hotel”<br />
<br />
“Do you want to try again this weekend?”<br />
<br />
“Not this weekend. We have had a family tragedy. My sister Sarah’s fiancé was in an accident last week and she had to turn the life support off yesterday. The funeral will be on Monday”<br />
<br />
That sucks”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it”<br />
<br />
“Give me a call after the funeral and we can try and cheer you up”<br />
<br />
“Ok Shaz. See you around”<br />
<br />
“By Jenna”<br />
<br />
I decided I would drive home via Sarah’s and give her back the dry-cleaned clothes. However when I got there, no-one was home. I left the suit and shirt in their plastic sheaths on a hook near the front door along with a note saying thank-you.<br />
<br />
I was back home in time to help Mum prepare dinner but when I offered to help she said to change out of my clothes as she thought the outfit I was wearing would be ideal to wear for my court appearance. She had a jacket that matched, which I could wear if the weather was cooler.<br />
<br />
I changed into jeans and a tee-shirt. And returned in time to eat dinner in front of the TV, with Mum and Dad, watching the news. When Home and Away came on I told Mum to pick something else to watch as I was no longer interested. “I have wasted enough of my life on this show” We ended up watching a movie on Netflix ‘The Do-Over’ starring Adam Sandler. It was actually better than I expected.<br />
After the movie I went to bed. My period was still quite heavy. It was only 9pm but I was tired and didn’t even try to read. I must have fallen asleep pretty quickly.</p>
