<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I&#39;ll be honest, a part of me didn&#39;t feel right touching this topic. I mean, since we were children people tell us not to pay attention to racial stereotypes and such but... The truth is that whether we like it or not we base ourselves on them so I don&#39;t see why not play with them a little.<br />
<br />
— Book... Could you show me a list of stereotypes about races?<br />
<br />
The book then showed a series of stereotypes about men and their sexuality based on their races.<br />
<br />
God... This list is huge... I... I&#39;d better start with something specific&quot; I said as I leafed through the book and saw a long list of the most diverse cliches.<br />
<br />
— Show me the sizes of men&#39;s penises according to their race. I said that and the book changed the list for some graphs showing the stereotypes of each of the races that human beings cataloged.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is known that the size of the male penis varies on a racial issues as well as other biological characteristics. Within these, Africans and Afro-descendants have the largest size, this with a measurement of between 10&#39; to 12&#39;, followed by the Caucasians, the Hispanics, Native Americans and Middle Eastern with a size between 8’ to 10’. Finally the Asians would be at the end with a smaller size in comparison, among these the East Asian stands out with a size of 7’ to 9’...&quot;<br />
<br />
When I read that I thought of some interesting ideas: &quot;If I&#39;m playing with measurements... It&#39;s worth having fun. First of all, black people with big members have been very cliché, let&#39;s take away a...&quot;<br />
<br />
— Oh come on, who am I fooling, let&#39;s put something very small. I said between laughs.<br />
<br />
Although... The whites have had a lot of fun... And I think it would be fun to play with that a little bit. Let&#39;s look at this... A couple of adjustments here and there... And that&#39;s it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is known that the size of the male penis varies on a racial issues as well as other biological characteristics. Within these, Africans, Afro-descendants and Caucasians have the smallest size, this with a measurement of between 0.5&#39; to 1&#39; this in comparison to the other races is quite distant, from there would be the Middle Eastern and South and South-East Asian with a measurement of between 8’ and 10’...&quot;<br />
<br />
— I&#39;ll see what I give them later. I said between laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Finally, East Asians, Hispanics and Native Americans would have the largest male member size recorded with an average size between 11&#39; to 13&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, let&#39;s see how it goes. I closed the book and waited to see what would work its magic. After a few seconds I started to feel something in my crotch.<br />
<br />
— Ugh, hot, hot, hot...<br />
<br />
Once I took off my underwear again I could see that the big penis that I had obtained a few minutes ago was now a miniature that was barely visible although...<br />
<br />
— Oh… it’s true, I change the size of the penis, not the size of the testicles.<br />
<br />
My tiny penis was smaller than my balls, not that it bothered me, on the contrary, it seemed like something fun and that a top might like (Which I&#39;m not).<br />
<br />
— Let&#39;s see how everything turned out. I said as I ran to the window.<br />
<br />
When I left I tried to see if there was anything different and... Nothing.<br />
<br />
— Of course idiot, it&#39;s not like guys normally go out on the street naked so you can see their dick, isn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
Although... I still have another option. I ran towards my room and looked for my laptop, my work changing the size of the boys&#39; penises had a specific place where I could see it clearly.<br />
<br />
—Just like my nights without a boyfriend, there is only one thing that could help me, porn.<br />
<br />
Going to my reference porn page and I wanted to look first if there was anything strange or different and... At first glance there wasn&#39;t so much, Latinos were always popular, it&#39;s just that now they looked a little more. What changed the most is that there were many more videos with boys with more tanned skin and finally the one I had been waiting for so much, I went to the Black guys section and...<br />
<br />
—Holy shit…<br />
<br />
When I entered the black guys section I was surprised by the number of videos, it was tiny for this page, and the most curious thing was the categories and thumbnails. Most of them were of black guys being humiliated with titles like &quot;Micro black guy gets punished for getting a boner&quot; or they were of cuckolds with titles such as &quot;I cheat on my husband with a small penis with a hung Korean stud&quot; That really surprises me... I want more!<br />
<br />
I rushed through the book and decided to play with things more. I have to be honest, I think I was a little bad today, but hey, it&#39;s fun.<br />
<br />
— Book, show me the characteristics of the races.<br />
<br />
The book opened and showed me a kind of chart with each race and their characteristics such as height, weight, skin colors, etc. I won&#39;t change a whole table like this...<br />
<br />
I decided to write in the margin to see if that would change things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hispanics, East Asians and Native Americans have an average height of 6&#39; 6&#39;&#39;, they have large and broad natural muscles, they don&#39;t even have to train them to make them stand out. This is also due to their high amount of body hair, including facial hair and pubic&quot;<br />
<br />
When I wrote that I went to the table and sure enough, the heights of those three changed and adapted to the table.<br />
<br />
— Well... what about... if I go crazy? I said as I started to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;The men of these three races are alpha males with a dominant, confident and aggressive nature. These are also the most desired by both men and women and they know it, acting according to their very very high libido, they always want to have a lot of sex and be with women but especially with men who they consider inferior&quot;<br />
<br />
Well now... If I have these tops... The logical thing would be to work with the bottoms (including me).<br />
<br />
&quot;Both African and Caucasian men have an average height of 5&#39; 4&quot; and have slim bodies with no body hair but a big bubble butt. They have an extraordinary capacity for endurance and anal dilation, apart from an overly sensitive prostate. Men of both races have a passive and submissive nature. They seek to be dominated by women, but especially by men they consider superior. They have a high libido and are not sexually satisfied until their partner is also satisfied.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I finished writing I closed the book and let the magic pass. This magic was immediate and I began to feel like my clothes were getting bigger, I was 5&#39; 7&#39;&#39; and had a decent physique but now...<br />
<br />
— Let&#39;s see what... Look at you! I said excitedly when I saw myself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Right now I had become a top Twink, my body was small and thin without the slightest sign of hair. Not only that, my butt had grown to a bubble butt.<br />
<br />
—This is something worth taking, but I want more...<br />
<br />
I sat back down and decided to look at something in the book.<br />
<br />
—Book, please show me the percentage of population according to race in the United States.<br />
<br />
The result returned was as follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;White: 60.1%<br />
Hispanic: 18.5%<br />
Black: 12.2%<br />
Asian: 5.6%<br />
American Indian/Alaska Native: 0.7%<br />
Other Races: 2.8%&quot;<br />
<br />
This would translate to a country full of bottom twinks, meaning we wouldn&#39;t have enough tops. I wonder if... What would happen if I changed the numbers? Will those who no longer enter die? Or will they change race? Well, there&#39;s only one way to find out. One or two less here, one or a thousand more here... And...<br />
<br />
&quot;Population percentage by race in the United States:<br />
<br />
White: 15%<br />
Hispanic: 20%<br />
Black: 10%<br />
Asian: 25%<br />
American Indian/Alaska Native: 20%<br />
Other Races: 10%&quot;<br />
<br />
That’s better, now the country has more tops, and I have more cattle to choose from. There&#39;s something else I could touch on, I thought as I closed the book and waited for the changes.<br />
<br />
— I already touched on height, size, personality, and quantity... It fits me... I think nothing for now...<br />
<br />
Although... I have yet to see my new world. I went to my computer and refreshed the porn page and... Oh my God, this doesn&#39;t look like anything I could imagine! The simple beginning of this was filled with several tan-skinned guys built like bodybuilders or furthermore. The first videos that came out had titles like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Latin macho dominates twins in front of the pool&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Korean stud marks his greatness to two blondes bareback&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indian shows his superiority to a cowgirl&quot;<br />
<br />
All the time you could see these studs mounting women and... I won&#39;t deny that despite being gay, only the miniatures even turned me on. I decided to look at the black guys section, which in the past was one of the most sought-after and... The difference left me with my eyes open, there were, and I am not exaggerating, 3 or 4 videos of boys that we could call &quot;big&quot; although for the status of the other races were far behind, but that didn&#39;t matter, the real importance was in EVERYTHING else. Most of the videos showed ebony-skinned twinks with mini penises cuckolding by some Latino or an Asian or directly being penetrated by girls with strap-ons, pegging, I think it’s called.<br />
<br />
— I wonder how it is... I said while changing the section to the gay part of the page.<br />
<br />
Just seeing the thumbnails left me completely shocked, hundreds of videos of Latino, Asian and what you could call native guys, all muscular and full of body hair. Titles such that:<br />
<br />
&quot;Japanese stud teaches big ass whore who&#39;s in charge&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mexican stepfather and stepbrothers make me their personal whore&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hung Indians and big ass cowboys, spoiler the Indians win&quot;<br />
<br />
My penis stopped immediately as soon as I saw the thumbnails, in all of them incredibly sexy men, machos with big cocks who I wanted to dominate me like the bottoms in the videos or so I thought until I saw someone I knew...<br />
<br />
- It can&#39;t be, that man is…</p>
