<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As passionate as the kiss was, it didn't last long. Night pulled away after a few moments, leaving me with a rather dopey look on my face. After a few moments I managed to shake it off and climbed out of the jacuzzi to begin looking for a towel to dry myself off. As I did so, my mind was awash with questions and new things to ponder over.<br />
<br />
Night had a &quot;boyfriend&quot; that she'd been seeing between the moons, but if her idea to split from Devon's pack and form her own with Terri and I, she'd dump him... Some of that didn't seem fair to her boyfriend, Kevin, I believe she said his name was. I found a small wooden cabinet protected by plastic ledge that was made to look like a window overhang and found not only some towels but my clothes, Terri's clothes, and Night's as well. All of them were neatly folded, though mine smelled a couple days old, but at present I didn't have much choice. Besides, I didn't interact with the public while I was at work, and I'd occasion seen some of my coworkers come in looking worse and not get fired, which was an odd quirk about the boss (considering his attendance policies) but I wasn't about to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; you said as you noticed the three sets of clothing in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just our clothes, dear,&quot; Terri said from the jacuzzi with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't remember putting them there,&quot; I told her sheepishly, &quot;I thought you two threw my clothes about the yard before we changed last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but after we changed we picked things up and folded them and put them in there before getting a small snack in the meat locker and then coming back out for some other games,&quot; Night responded with a smirk of her own, &quot;don't worry, few werewolves if any remember entirely what they do after their first transformation. The few that are born werewolves were too young to remember, and those that were bitten, like all three of us were are still adjusting to the processes of transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; was all you could manage as you began drying yourself off, struggling not to return to the jacuzzi and dive in. You didn't want to go to work, but since Night didn't push you over the edge, you knew you had to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Night... if things go right... wouldn't your plan be hard on the guy you've been seeing... Kevin, right?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, his name is Kevin, and are you backing out?&quot; Night asked, sounding slightly irritated.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not backing out,&quot; I said quickly, &quot;To be honest, if you and Terri look like you do now when we were all in high school, I probably would have tried to marry both of you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, if things work out, you will be marrying both of us,&quot; Night answered.<br />
<br />
I blushed a little as I found my underwear and began to pull it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but what will he do when he finds out you're dumping him for another woman and her husband?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He'd probably be upset, but Kevin is really just a big teddy bear,&quot; Night answered, &quot;He isn't the type to go on a shooting rampage to get even or something like that. It's generally why I've been &quot;dating&quot; him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're sure you don't want him?&quot; Terri asked, &quot;I'm sure John would be more then willing to share me on nights outside the full moon as well... We'll do anything to make you happy... you did, after all, enable us to get back together...&quot;<br />
<br />
Night moved to hug Terri, and I very nearly drooled as I watched hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you both for that... but with Kevin as another male... that'd only just create a slightly different version of what we have presently with Devon,&quot; Night sighed, &quot;to be honest, Terri, a lot of my willingness to help you get John back has been because I've loved you... I know I was rotten at flirting with you so much when you and John first married, and it wouldn't surprise me if that ultimately helped in causing your divorce... but that didn't change how I've felt about you. Being a werewolf has brought about my present attractions to males as well as females, just as it made you attracted to females as well as males...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolf females,&quot; Terri interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you were the one who was always in my heart,&quot; Night finished, &quot;We can't really have that with Devon right now, because he's treating the pack like his own personal harem... I need you, Terri, and that's why, once I'd burned off all of the fat I had through all the transformations I'd had, I contacted you on facebook. I'd figured Kevin could provide the strong protective role the male traditionally plays and you could be the soft and loving partner the female traditionally plays, and with Kevin as a werewolf, he wouldn't mind sharing you with me and would have the stamina to please both of us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still loved John,&quot; Terri said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And John isn't so bad,&quot; Night nodded, &quot;true he's had his rather shallow moments, but overall he isn't that bad... and none of us will ever be &quot;fat&quot; again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless I get one or both of you pregnant,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll cross that bridge if we come to it, dear,&quot; Terri answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And since John apparently still loves you and from what he growled to us last night, was very regretful that he divorced you in the first place, he'd make a fine male for the both of us,&quot; Night finished, &quot;Yes, Kevin's feelings may be hurt... but Kevin is a good guy and a big teddy bear. And I will be tactful with him when the break up comes... if it comes... depending on what can be done with Devon.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Terri gave Night a soft kiss, and just barely fought the urge pull them both out of the jacuzzi and then attempt to make love to them with your clothes on. You then looked down at your watch as you finished dressing. It was about time that you needed to head out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta get going before I'm late,&quot; you said nervously, &quot;have a good day and I'll see you both after work... maybe you could see if you could find some of the werewolf boyfriends that Devon forced out... or try to. Maybe if they can be found and they all come back, we might be able to get a better bargaining position...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'd be tough, because no one knows what happened to Tonya or Raelynn's boyfriends,&quot; Night said with a sigh, &quot;don't worry, Terri and I will think of something... or at least try to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful John! Remember, you'll need meat through the day! And don't go after any tail that isn't ours!&quot; Terri added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, thank you, both,&quot; I called back and turned to make my way out. I was still nervous, both because of the situation with Devon, and what was ahead of me at work.</p>
