<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen&#39;s morning went fairly quietly after she and Claire had gotten up. A part of her wished that Claire could have stayed longer, and she was heavily surprised by how fast things were moving between the two of them. Things between her and Jeff hadn&#39;t moved quite as fast, or at least that was how Jen remembered it. It could have happened that fast, as Jen did know that her time with Jeff was wonderful and something she never wanted to forget. But she could see that her time with Claire was happening quickly and more quickly than she could have expected. As she went about cleaning up the kitchen after the rushed breakfast the thought soon came to her on whether or not it was too fast or that she was trying to replace Jeff Decker...<br />
<br />
&quot;He was fine when I had a fling with some other female were while were in Moon Lake and on the few times that we came across one while he was alive and serving outside Moon Lake,&quot; Jen thought to herself, &quot;but that was all just accepting that I was bisexual... it was never anything more than sex... Claire... she&#39;s becoming more than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was at the core element of her fears that came up and they conflicted with her growing interest in Claire. The fact that she had wanted to be a werecat, even though she&#39;d likely see her sexuality change was something to Jen and the fact that she had been understanding of Jen&#39;s feelings regarding Jeff helped inspire some of her thoughts that were actually drawing her toward Claire. It created some sensation that Claire wasn&#39;t out to replace Jeff, which Jen could welcome and the fact that Tad seemed okay with that gave Jen a bit more ease with regard to that. However, there was also the concern that Claire might only hold interest in Jen because Jen was the one to turn her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Female weres are just as sexy as male weres and if Claire&#39;s gone full lesbian... she&#39;ll be finding that out,&quot; Jen thought to herself, &quot;and she&#39;ll find that out... with werecats at an E cup... werefox vixens at an F cup... werecows at anything from an H to a J cup, depending on whether they&#39;re beef, dairy or a mixed breed... all potentially wonderful partners and Claire could find herself drawn to them...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was all conflict that worried Jen and seemed to pull her in two directions at once. One was the fear that she was betraying Jeff for jumping so quickly into a major relationship and the other was a fear that Claire might find herself attracted to someone else. And Jen found herself pacing her kitchen as she worried over these things, knowing full well they&#39;d be something to talk with Frances about when she had her next grief consoling session on Wednesday. It&#39;d be something she knew she probably wouldn&#39;t be able to get away from as Frances was well aware of the fact that she had taken Claire from the Halloween dance to turn Claire, and Frances would surely ask. It would help her with sorting things out between the memory of the wonderful man who had sired her son and had been a major part of her life for quite a long period of time, more than eighteen years, and the new friend she had made who promised to be more than just a friend.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts and worries were soon interrupted when she heard the telephone ring. It made her jump as the bell gave it&#39;s shrill &quot;bbbrrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggg&quot; to indicate that someone was trying to contact her. Once Jen recovered she made her way to the phone and picked up the plastic handset and answered the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jen spoke as she picked up, putting her mental worries in the background for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, is this Jennifer Decker?&quot; a male voice said on the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,  whom may I ask is calling?&quot; Jen answered slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Brian Wilcox up at the Moon Lake Wells Fargo Bank, you left an application with us regarding a teller position...&quot; the male voice answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jen said nodding, remembering the applications she&#39;d turned in the previous week, mostly into some of the sorts of positions that she&#39;d been qualified to fill and had filled while she travelled with Jeff during his career in the Marine Corps. Many weren&#39;t always the most glamorous or the high paying, but they helped and gave her something to do, particularly while Tad was in school. This had included various secretarial and low level office jobs here and there and they lasted until Jeff was transferred to a new unit or until the unit he was with was transferred to a new base. The best position that she&#39;d had once was a nursing position that she&#39;d picked up thanks to both some online courses and the inevitable work to patch bumps and bruises that Tad got growing up, but again, that job had only lasted until they had to move again. Now that she was back in Moon Lake, though, it wasn&#39;t likely that she&#39;d be moving again for quite a while and she would need to find some steady employment, and thus the applications she&#39;d sent out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d seen you had a position open and since I&#39;d just returned to Moon Lake, I sent it in... get started again as it were,&quot; Jen continued with her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Brian Wilcox answered calmly, &quot;anyway, with your resume we could see that you&#39;ve worked as a teller with a couple of other banks before and do find your education and qualifications to be quite exemplary and wish to schedule an interview for the position.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An interview?&quot; Jen&#39;s voice squeaked a bit trying to hold back some excitement. She pulled the phone away from her head to clear her throat and then returned it close to then continue, &quot;That&#39;s great to hear. When do you wish to hold the interview?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment we&#39;re looking at this coming Friday at ten AM,&quot; Brian Wilcox answered, &quot;Is that good for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a moment, please, I need to get some note paper,&quot; Jen spoke and set the phone on the counter near the phone. She quickly retrieved a notepad she could use for messages and a pen and return to the phone. Once she returned to the phone, she picked it up and placed to her ear, cricking her head to a side so as to pin the phone between her head and her shoulder, &quot;Friday is good for me. Is there anyone in particular you wish me to report to for the interview or anything more you wish me to bring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don&#39;t need to bring anything,&quot; Brian Wilcox replied, &quot;just come through the main doors and come toward the personnel area at the rear of the bank... and the bank here in Moon Lake. I&#39;ll be waiting for you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen jotted down a few quick notes as she listened, marking down Moon Lake -Wells Fargo - Friday 10AM.  There were other banks in the area and a fair number of Moon Lake residents that could travel often DID travel into Seattle when they had banking missions to handle, but the town had a couple of functioning banks. One was a local bank that was entirely local with its start in Moon Lake and for the purposes of working with Moon Lake and the other had been Wells Fargo, which had managed to get in thanks to the fact that it had offices throughout the country. The Wells Fargo bank was the one that Jen had applied to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you then,&quot; Jen spoke after Brian Wilcox finished, &quot;thank you. Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Jen hung up the phone and returned to some of her day to day chores, though the scenario that had just gone down ultimately repeated itself through the morning. Many of the people that Jen had sent applications into responded and responded rather quickly with interview offers, which Jen felt as very fortunate, given how tough the job climate had been across the country in recent years, and potentially even harder in a place like Moon Lake where most of the residents hand lengthy lifespans that got to a point where they wouldn&#39;t look old until after their three hundredth birthday. In fact the lack of regular turnover in Moon Lake was something that often lead to many weres leaving Moon Lake, at least periodically.<br />
<br />
With these calls, Jen soon had a list of interviews that she&#39;d be expected for. She had an interview for a secretary&#39;s position with Tachibana Industries the coming Wednesday at 3: 30 PM, the teller position at the Moon Lake Wells Fargo on Friday 10 AM, and a nursing position at Moon Lake General Hospital on the coming Saturday at 9:45 AM. Jen checked these with some of the other applications she&#39;d sent out, many of which went to either other small towns that were nearby or to Seattle, all of which were close enough that she could commute if need be, however, they hadn&#39;t answered back, yet. However, the fact that she&#39;d gotten three calls for an interview was a good sign and Jen hoped that she&#39;d make a good impression with at least one of them.</p>
