<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark slept.  It was a deep sleep.  His mind churning with the new images and feelings he had seen and felt while posing.  In his mind, he saw himself enter a gym.  A hard core power pit of a gym.  The music playing on the PA system had a hard pounding beat.  Mixed in was the clanking of metal plates being moved by others training is the large space.  Every once in a while there was a guttural grunt and snort and an occasional low growling scream hung low in the space.  The equipment was well worn from consistent use.  The smell of sweat permeated the air.<br />
<br />
Going over to a nearby bench Mark could see the bar was already loaded with six 55Kg plates.  He lay down on the bench.  It seems natural and unnatural to him at the same time.  The weight of his body pushing into the padding felt good but the gap between the bench and his lower back he wasn't used to.  As he grabbed the bar with his hands, he slid them back and forth to find the sweet spot among the knurling.   With a quick inhale filling his massive chest and then the effort to straighten his elbows to move the bar from above the resting position to over his chest.  Breathing in, the weight came down effortlessly and went back up just as easily as he forcefully exhaled from his expanded lungs.  This repeated over and over and the weight seemed to get lighter with each rep.<br />
<br />
Mark reracked the weight and sat up.  He could feel the rush of blood flowing into his pecs making the muscles feel tighter.  Mark couldn't believe the rush that he felt as he pumped his arms back and forth stretching the muscle.  Mark felt good like he never before.  He got up from the bench and threw another 25Kg plate on each side and repeated the exercise process. After an additional 5 sets with increasing weights, Mark shifted his focus to the squat rack.<br />
<br />
As Mark stood up and strode over to the squat rack he could feel the gazes of the other gym rats focused on him.  It felt good to be the focus of attention after being ignored for most of his life.  He had to adjust his stride as he wasn't used to the bulk his body was now carrying.<br />
<br />
The squat rack had a preloaded bar on it right at the height that Mark needed.  Fitting under the bar he adjusted his stance getting centered again feeling the rough knurling on his callused palm. When he stood he felt the pressure of the weighted bar sink into his sinewed  neck muscles as the bar raised off the metal supports.  With a single step back, Mark steadied his stance and then starting moving up and down like a piston.  He could feel his thighs rub against each other with each motion. A feeling of euphoria started to take over on the first set and got more intense with each heavier subsequent set.<br />
<br />
On his sixth set Mark was at the bottom of the movement before starting to power back up to a standing position when he felt a pressure coming from his groin.  He was looking in the mirror as his mouth flew wide open and the pupils of his eyes dilated with a blinding flash of white light.<br />
<br />
Marks eyes fluttered open.  He was back in his bedroom laying flat on his back staring at the ceiling.  His breath hitched during a series of quick gulps of air.  Inhaling there was the smell of sweat that assailed his nostrils.  He looked down towards his feet but he couldn't see them past the mounds of muscle and matted wet hair that was his chest and stomach.<br />
<br />
Mark started to sit up using his arms and elbows to brace to gigantic upper body where he stopped for a few seconds.  With a quick forceful motion Mark moved off the bed to an upright position where he quickly swayed being off balance.    &quot;Whoa&quot; Mark said.  &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a few cautious steps Mark approached the closet mirror and stopped in awe.  Starting back in the mirror was a thick fireplug of a man that Mark didn't know could exist.  He moved his hand to feel his chest.  It was just this large slab of beef that he was hefting up and down in his cupped hand.  His traps were mounded up alongside his neck.  The hair on his face had gotten thicker.  Using his right hand he reached up and grabbed a clump of his beard.  Not only were the individual hairs fatter, but there were more hairs there as well.  <br />
<br />
He hadn't gotten taller, but he had packed on mass.  Focusing the view on his thighs, they were massive. In the few steps he had taken he could see how his legs had been pushed apart by the new mass they had acquired.  He could feel the tickling of the leg hairs.  They looked like they almost belonged on a grizzly bear.  What amazed him the most were his calves.  It was clear that the muscle extended beyond both sides of the bone almost like someone had over inflated footballs and attached them behind his shins.<br />
<br />
Turning sideways his thickness became apparent. Mark stood on this toes and could see the skin shift revealing the indentions showing where the calf muscle separated from the front of the leg.  The hamstrings and quads obscenely bulged out above the knee cap.  He had what looked like a roid gut but it was the back and chest that appeared to be a yard wide from front to back.  His mouth opened wide and took several deep breaths causing the chest and back to expand and contract making the dimensions seem all that much bigger.<br />
<br />
Mark blinked a few times taking in what he saw.  He shook his head like he was trying to wake himself from a dream.  He ran into the bathroom having to steady himself as he went adjusting to the new stance and mass on his frame.  It took some effort to bend down and grab his scale and bring it back to the mirror.  He knew that he wasn't going to be able to look down and see the numbers past his pecs and gut.  Placing the device near the mirror, Mark carefully stepped on the unit.  He could hear the metal stress as he went from one foot to having both feet place side by side on the weighing device.  He saw the numbers spin around and fly past 350 in the reflection.  He couldn't tell how much more as he felt something inside the case give way causing the scale to fail.<br />
<br />
Mark slowly lifted his head looking from the scale directly into his own reflection eyes when he had a huge grin on his face.  Somehow the workout in his dream had turned into reality on his own body.  If he kept dreaming like this, who knows how big he could get.</p>
