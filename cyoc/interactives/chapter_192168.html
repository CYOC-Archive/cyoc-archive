<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler sat on his couch, drinking a soda while watching sports highlights. His ability to taste or process solid food may be slowly evaporating, but at least he could still enjoy beer, sodas, and other flavored drinks. He’d spent the rest of the afternoon on his phone, flipping between pages of information discussing small-dicks and their roles in society. He was surprised to see that many of them were very wealthy; one of them had a lucrative tenure as a sex worker and performer at a casino in Vegas. Another one had partnered up with his large-dick husband to open a Michelin star restaurant in New York, where celebrity chef’s prepared extraordinary meals for their large-dick clientele, as well as serving themselves to rich small-dicks from around the world. A lot of businesses and universities offered enticing contracts to small-dicks to work for them and offer their “services” to their large-dicked staff. There were even small-dicks in some professional sports. Penis injuries were common among large-dicks in professional sports; Leyton Manning was a small-dick, Tyler remembered. He remembered the quarterback recounting in interviews that his lack of a dick enabled him to outrun the over-encumbered large-dicks struggling behind him. <br />
<br />
He also learned that as a small-dick, he had a natural instinct to follow any order given to him by a large-dick. According to the internet, it had something to do with how a part of his brain, dormant in large-dicks, responding to a man’s lower voice register. Tyler had felt turned on when he heard the swagger and confidence in Colby’s voice, but the idea of being ordered around by other men made him feel uneasy. His father, his professors, the cook down at the deli, any of those men could make him do whatever they wanted. No wonder so many small-dicks worked so hard to build a life of wealth and prestige. His thoughts turned back to the note, left for him in his car. Had someone from the deli left it? Tyler wondered, No; how would they know which car was his…. Someone else must have been out at the river, Tyler reasoned, and had seen some or all of his activities with his friend. There were a lot of homes and farms dotting the hills out there. His thoughts were interrupted, however, by the rumble of his father’s truck pulling into the driveway. Tyler switched to the armchair and crossed his legs, trying to look natural as his father came through the door.<br />
<br />
“What’s up, buddy,” he crumbled, shutting the door behind him and dropping his bag by the door. <br />
<br />
“What’s up, Dad. How was work?” Tyler asked.<br />
<br />
“Terrible. Been bouncing around in the heat all day. My balls feel like they’re melting into my shoes.” He replied, unbuttoning his shirt. “I’m gonna take a shower, and then we can have dinner. I got us steaks, since its just us guys,” he grinned, before leaving for his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Shit, Tyler thought, of course he picks tonight to be master chef. Tyler had been starting to feel a bit peckish; he was looking forward to seeing Colby later for ‘dinner’. Maybe he could make up an excuse, fake a stomach cramp or something. He would tell his father that he was going to Colby’s house for dinner instead, but he didn’t want to have to worry about Colby’s father or any of his asshole brothers walking in on them while he had Colby down his throat to the balls. At least here he knew that after dinner his father would celebrate the night by watching a half hour of ‘The Rockford Files” and passing out on the couch, and the man slept like a rock. <br />
<br />
Tyler’s father emerged from his bedroom, freshly showered and wearing only a white t-shirt and a pair of blue boxers that did almost nothing to hide the massive bulge snaking down his thigh. As the big man took a seat on the couch, Tyler noticed the bulbous, hooded head of his father’s cock peaking out from the leg of his shorts.<br />
<br />
“Dad!” Tyler snapped, his face flushing as he felt himself grow hard.<br />
<br />
“What?” James looked at him quizzically and then looked down. “Oh, sorry. With the heat and your mother being gone, just wanted to be comfortable.” He said, spreading his legs. “I’m sure you’re still getting used to having a big ‘ol log between your legs, huh?” he chuckled, reaching for the remote to change the channel. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, its been…a lot of growing pains…” he replied, not looking at his father as the man gave him a pondering look. He set the remote down and stood up from the couch. <br />
<br />
“I think I’m gonna get dinner started. You mind grabbing your old man a beer from the garage?” he asked, making eye contact for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Sure, Dad,” Tyler said, feeling himself get up from the chair and make for the garage.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, buddy. Grab one for yourself, while you’re at it.” He said before turning away to hide his smirk and heading for the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Tyler joined him there a few minutes later, emerging from the garage with two cold ones in hand and a nervous, miniature erection in his pants. He cracked them open and handed one over to his father, who was busy at the kitchen counter. <br />
<br />
“Don’t be mad it me if I’m not that hungry,” Tyler said, seating himself at the counter. “Colby and I had a…big lunch.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll bet you did,” his father said in a such a hushed tone that Tyler almost didn’t hear him. “Hey, you talk to your uncle Jack lately?” He asked, out of the blue. Jack was his uncle on his mother’s side.<br />
<br />
“Not lately, no,” Tyler and his uncle had been close when he was younger, but since the man had retired he’d been pretty distant from the family. <br />
<br />
“You should stop by his place some time, say hi,” his Dad said casually as he sliced vegetables with deft strokes. “I think it would be good for you to get close with him, before you leave for college.”<br />
<br />
“Why’s that?”<br />
<br />
“No reason,” His father shrugged, turning to the stove and slapping down a cast iron pan. “Just want my family to be happy.”<br />
<br />
They chatted in the kitchen for another twenty minutes before dinner was ready, steaks medium rare as both men preferred it. Tyler looked down at the sizzling cut of beef on his plate; he knew he couldn’t eat it, but it smelled delicious. His father one the other hand was tearing into his meal with gusto. They talked some more, Tyler fumbling with his plate and enjoying his beer. His father shook his head when he noticed Tyler had hardly touched anything.<br />
<br />
“You weren’t lying. Well, don’t let that steak go to waste; hand it over!”<br />
<br />
“So, Colby’s coming over later,” Tyler said as his dad resumed eating. “We might be up for a while, playing games and stuff.”<br />
<br />
His father gave him a look before saying, “That’s fine, I guess. Just don’t be too loud; I have work in the morning.”<br />
<br />
“Headphones, I promise. Sorry I wasn’t very hungry tonight,” He said, getting up from the table.<br />
<br />
“Its okay, buddy. I understand.” James replied, raising his glass to his son.<br />
<br />
Tyler just nervously turned on his heel and made for his room. He shut the door and pulled out his phone so he could text Colby.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man. You still coming over?” he typed.<br />
<br />
A moment later, “Don’t worry, little buddy. I’m already on my way. 5 min.” Tyler sighed in relief. He was starving, despite what he’d just told his father. When he saw his friend pull up by the curb, Tyler jumped up and tried to get to the door first, but his father must have been closer. As he walked down the hallway, he heard the sound of Colby knocking on the door, and his father’s heavy footsteps as he crossed the living room to open the door. Tyler appeared in the living room just aa Colby was stepping through the door, shaking hands with his father. <br />
<br />
“Looking good, Colby. Excited about your birthday?” James asked.<br />
<br />
“Yessir,” Colby grinned. He’d changed into a pair of grey sweat pants and a band shirt, the sweats leaving little to the imagination; Colby must have been looking forward to coming over. “Oh hey, little buddy!” He said when he noticed Tyler coming into the room. <br />
<br />
Tyler blushed, hoping his father didn’t think too much on that. “What’s up, man. You ready to get owned on Overwatch?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it is on. Have a good night, Mr. P,” Colby said, striding forward and pushing Tyler to his room.<br />
<br />
Tyler shut his bedroom door while Colby sat down on Tyler’s bed. “So, did you enjoy your dad’s dick for dinner?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, my god. You are so out of pocket,” Tyler shook his head and sat down on his chair.<br />
<br />
Colby chuckled. “Just assumed. Man’ I kind of hate when he opens the door like that in just his boxers. That thing is a weapon.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, buddy. You’re right behind him, with a tool like that.” Tyler said, pointing to Colby’s semi-hard length.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, small-dick. And, know what? Its still growing! I measured when I got home, and it was fourteen inches, almost!” Colby guffawed, the bulge in his sweats expanding with pride. Tyler himself was feeling butterflies the thought of Colby’s deliciously large schlong still growing larger. “You should measure that little cocklet of yours.” Colby suggested.<br />
<br />
“You think its gotten smaller?” Tyler asked, surprised at his own hopefulness.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, I don’t think it can get any smaller. But let’s find out.”<br />
<br />
Tyler went for his night stand and dug out the tailor’s tape. He turned away from Colby, to pull down his pants and measure.<br />
<br />
“Don’t turn away, short-dick,” Colby ordered. “I love seeing how small your coklet is compared to my big schlong.”<br />
<br />
Tyler blushed and giggled, but did as he was told, exposing his semi-hard little cock and balls to his friend. Colby whistled.<br />
<br />
“I hate to say it, little buddy, but I love you like this. You’re still the same all around, except for your perfect little cocklet and those cute little balls.” Colby said, his tone deep and slow, making Tyler moan. “Ha, I knew that would get that fingerling of yours hard. If you can call that hard.” Tyler looked down and took hold of his aching cocklet and tried to apply the tape with shaking hands.<br />
<br />
“Well?” the man asked.<br />
<br />
“Its…” Tyler’s voice trembled as his heart leapt. “It is smaller. Less than four inches now,” he said, hearing his own words.<br />
<br />
Colby just slapped his knee and laughed. “Oh, boy. And you’re birthday is still two weeks away! I’ll bet by then you won’t even be an inch long!” Tyler moaned again, his legs feeling weak as a spurt of precum oozed from his now straining cocklet, and Colby noticed. “You like that, huh? What’s your big-cocked, Man of a father gonna say when he learns his only son is a small-dick, “ he emphasized both words, “with a limp, useless, nub of a cocklet?” It was more than Tyler could bear; the shame and the humiliation all became one erotic wave in the small-dick’s mind as he felt his cocklet erupt in orgasm, his legs buckling from underneath him. Tyler caught himself on the table, taking deep breaths as he recovered from his orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you small-dicks do really enjoy getting taunted,” Colby said, watching Tyler slink onto the ground and lean his back against the bed between his legs. <br />
<br />
“It just makes me feel so good, to hear you make fun of my…cocklet,” Tyler replid, the word still tasting funny on his mouth. He felt Colby’s big hands come to rest on tyler’s shoulders, gently squeezing and massaging them. <br />
<br />
“I know, little buddy. I enjoy it too; I really feel like you bring out the man in me.” He said quietly.<br />
<br />
Tyler felt a heavy weight on his shoulder and looked over to see Colby’s hard, expanding cock pressing against the thin cotton of the man’s sweat pants. “Speaking of ‘bring out the man’…” he trailed off. “I’m starting to feel a little hungry,” he said, looking up at Colby.<br />
<br />
“Well, I got a big meal ready for you, little buddy.” Colby said with a throaty chuckle, opening the waist of his pants to fish out his giant dick. Tyler jumped as a thick length of warm, hard flesh suddenly slumped over his shoulder. He looked over to see the throbbing head of Colby’s cock next to his own, He reached up to take hold of it, feeling a wave of contentment roll over him when as the familiar weight and warmth of his friends schlong met his fingers.<br />
<br />
“Don’t tell my dad, please,” Tyler whispered before turning himself around and positioning the head of Colby’s cock at his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Its all just large-dick talk, little buddy,” Colby chuckled, rubbing and squeezing his balls in front of Tyler’ eyes. “Your secret is safe with me. Now come show your best friend how much you live him, and suck his big manly cock with that perfect mouth of yours.”<br />
<br />
Tyler wasted no time, diving onto the head and making love to it with his lips, his mouth, his tongue. Colby gasped, using one hand to grip Tyler’s head while the other clenched the bed sheets; Tyler flexed the muscles of his throat experimentally, drawing Colby’s cock further into him without even moving the rest of his body. Colby’s eyes widened as he felt himself get pulled forward on the bed a little bit. The man could feel the head of his cock being massaged and squeezed by Tyler’s throat muscles, drawing his dick in further and further. Tyler inhaled more and more of the cock, still shocked at how his body manipulated itself to permit the intrusive size. For the second time that day, Tyler found his face buried in Colby’s pubes; he could feel the hairs on Colby’s enormous ballsack tickling his chin. <br />
<br />
“Oh, baby, you were made for this,” Colby groaned, bucking his hips lightly against Tylers face. Did he call me baby? Tyler asked himself. It made him feel good, like he was doing his job at giving pleasure to his man. Tyler found he could still stick his tongue out of his mouth, and so he used it to tickle and lick as much of Colby’s musky balls as it could reach while he moved his body gently up and down his shaft. He felt Colby’s strong hands reach under Tyler’s armpits. Careful not to let even an inch of his glorious cock slip out of Tyler, he carefully twisted and meanuvered the small-dick into a different position Tyler moaned as the cock inside him twisted and adjusted, his cocklet straining and leaking, until he opened his eyes to find himself laying on his back on the bed, with Colby standing over him. <br />
“Stay just like that, baby.” Colby commanded, before he began to drive himself into Tyler with long, deep strokes. Tyler watched as Colby’s pendulous balls swung back and forth with each thrust. “Look at that pathetic little cocklet,” Colby grunted, taking hold of Tyler’s head with both hands. “Its nothing compared to this,” he thrust himself into Tyler’s face all the way to the hilt. “How does it feel to have your mouth stretched around ten inches of girth?” Tyler’s eyes were watering, but his cocklet was harder than ever and in spite of the size, he honestly didn’t feel that stretched out. If anything, Tyler felt like he could take more. He couldn’t smile, but he gave his friend the thumbs up. “Oh, the small-dick likes it,” he whispered, before resuming his fucking, and harder this time. “I’m glad you’re learning your place, little buddy.” <br />
<br />
Colby continued to fuck Tyler’s face for what felt like a long time, adjusting his pace, the angle of his thrusts, all while Tyler squirmed on the bed, tweaking his nipples and squeezing his tiny balls. At some point Colby stopped and began to pull himself out, chuckling when Tyler realized this and began using his throat to suck the cock back in. He obliged the small-dick and drove himself back in hard before resuming his thrusts; he was ready to feed his friend. Tyler was in bliss as Colby fucked the shit out of his face, just as the man said he would back on the riverbank only a few hours ago. Colby could feel his heavy balls churning and roiling as the slammed against his small-dicks face. He could feel his orgasm approaching and started thrusting into Tyler harder and faster until the man came. Tyler watched with rapture as Colby strained and growled above him, his manly face contorting in pleasure as his enormous cock expelled pint after pint of nutritious cum down Tyler’s throat. Tyler could feel his belly fill with Colby’s healthy load, making his own cock erupt and spurt its pitiful load as the warm and full feeling enveloped him. Colby stood haunched over Tyler’s head, gripping his balls as if to massage every last drop out of them. Tyler reached out to grip Colby’s thighs and hold the man close against him, savoring the sensation of the schlong pulsing and throbbing inside of him as it expelled the last of its contents. With some reluctance, Colby slowly pulled himself out of Tyler’s soft, tight jaw until his heavy fourteen inches came out of Tyler’s jaw with a pop. <br />
<br />
Colby was taking deep, heavy breaths; he collapsed onto Tyler’s bed, grabbing one of Tyler’s arms and tugging. He was surprised when Colby pulled him closer, up onto his chest so he could hold the smaller man in a tight, protective embrace. Tyler felt himself melting against the man. He enjoyed the way Colby’s chest hair’s tickled his cheek, the feeling of holding himself against Colby’s warm, meaty chest. Colby’s arm reach down to rest on the cheek of Tyler’s bare ass; he squirmed a bit at the contact, but it felt good, it felt right. It made him feel protected and….sexy, he admitted to himself. Colby gave his ass a squeeze and Tyler nuzzled himself closer, feeling warm and content by his friend’s side. Without realizing it, both men had soon drifted off to sleep.</p>
