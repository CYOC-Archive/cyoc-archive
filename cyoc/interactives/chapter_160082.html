<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That morning, Matt woke up to strange sensation filling his boxers. It was warm and making the flannel fabric stick to his crotch, and at first that was the best he could make of it while still in a groggy daze. He rolled up his gray wife beater and sent a hand down to investigate the wet spot that had pooled beside his half-erect member. It was only a couple more seconds before he got the full picture.<br />
<br />
“Huh? I frickin’ jizzed myself?” He thought while sitting up and moving the covers away to see. “Aw, what the hell? I thought I already became a man when I hit 16!”<br />
<br />
He leaped out of bed with a start, ready to act fast and hide the evidence before Jacob got up and laughed in his face. He loved him like a true bro, but nothing was more irritating than that twerpy little laugh.<br />
<br />
But when he looked around the room, he saw the empty bed across from his and knew that he was weirdly all alone for it being that early in the day. Weirder still was the fact that his normally OCD roommate had chosen to leave his sheets unmade before leaving. It would suck big time if this was the start of a new habit, because he counted on Jake to clean up all of his things, too.<br />
<br />
Just a moment after he wondered this, Matt’s ears caught the sound of something coming from the other side of the closed door leading to their bathroom. It was like a soft, melodious humming interspersed with the slightly louder sounds of someone panting and moaning.<br />
<br />
“Jake?” He shouted with confusion in his tone. “Dude, is that you?”<br />
<br />
The noise abruptly ended, and for a short while there was dead silence until a voice came through the other side that answered, “D-Don’t come in here!”<br />
<br />
Now, he was really confused and starting to get a little ticked at everything that was going topsy-turvy today before it was even noon.<br />
<br />
“And why the fuck not? Last I knew, you needed me to help you shave in there every other morning, so what’s so different about today?” He waited patiently for a reply, but instead the humming noises picked up again like nobody had said anything at all. Matt felt like he was being ignored. “That’s it! You know it ain’t cool to just leave me hanging!”<br />
<br />
Matt began to motion for the door when he noticed that his well-trained and athletically proportioned body felt very unbalanced. He knew that as an amateur weightlifter aiming to someday reach heavyweight class, keeping within a certain bulk was something he made sure was part of his routine, as was honing fine control of his muscles and gait. Now walking, for some reason, seemed completely wrong: his upper torso felt so stacked and heavy that he was afraid at any second he might topple over. What’s worse was that every joint and tendon throughout his body felt as tense as steel, and it was like some unknown force was winding up his calves so he’d have to tread on his toes.<br />
<br />
Somehow, he reached the door, and then a nauseous feeling circled through his gut, leaving him with an instant migraine centered around his temples when it passed. The way he felt now might have been a contender for sickest he’s ever been.<br />
<br />
“Wait, sick...Oh, crap...” He just then remembered what the doctor told them the other day. “Jake! Jake, you need to get out here, man! I think my change is starting. We need to go get the guys and—”<br />
<br />
But when he cracked open the door, a scene awaited him that was so disturbing and unimaginable that it took his breath away. There was Jacob, bare ass naked, with one leg raised above the sink counter like a dog ready to piss over a hydrant. His legs were hairier and his skinny body much better toned than Matt remembered. His eyes were fixed on his own reflection in the mirror, absorbed in watching him worship his new biceps with his mouth. Always, he kept one arm raised enough to expose an armpit while the other was busy helping him beat himself off with all the intensity of a rutting beast. An upbeat tune escaped his lips all the while, like he was humming his own anthem to keep himself edged on.<br />
<br />
“Ugh! Oh, yeah...Nngh! Fuck, I’m a god...Ooooh, yeah...Ah! Aaagh!” As his song broke down into perverse groans, his elongated cock sprayed out its cup-load of spunk into the basin, which was already caked with the stuff no doubt from previous shots. He paused for a moment in bliss before the singing picked up again and he was back to the start of the routine.<br />
<br />
“Oh, fu—” Matt gasped, stumbling backwards in horror. Immediately, he picked up on a rush of what he could only describe as excitement mixed in with it, and a quick look down at the tent in his underwear was enough to confirm it. The noise was enough to catch Jacob’s attention, who stared back at his roommate and his cock head poking out of the folds in his shorts with utter embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“N-No! You can’t see me yet!” He screamed, rushing to slam the door in Matt’s face and lock it from the inside.<br />
<br />
Matt was left just standing there on the other side in a daze, his heart pounding a million beats-per-second over what he just saw and what awkwardly happened between them. His head was swimming full of clouded thoughts about what was going to happen now and where their friendship would go moving forward. For a while, his mind was so far detached from reality, until what was happening to the rest of him brought him back.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the tension in his muscles became so bad it made his whole body shake with cramps. Matt’s shoulders and arms started to itch, and he saw a light dusting of hair shooting up from the skin before his eyes. Worst of all, the pain in his head was now concentrated on two small bumps that had formed on either side, and a similar feeling had emerged above his rear. He knew what was happening...<br />
<br />
“Oh, God! Why is it changing me faster?” He breathed out in a whisper. His brain was panicked and working on overdrive to try and recall everything he’d spent 5 minutes yesterday online looking up about the bull-headed, labyrinth-guarding creature he was meant to become. The web barely said anything about minotaurs being this kind of horny. Anyway, as much as he felt for Jake, he needed to seek out his own help quickly, and he trusted his instincts to tell him where to go.</p>
