<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jarred lay on his bed a bovine nose ring clipped in his nostrils and a powerful silver buckle glowing on his chest. The buckle's glare was so bright he reach for his sun glasses on the bedside table.
<br />

<br />
As he set them on his face they rocked to one side or the other. A strange problem, the glasses seemed not to fit his face anymore. Jarred tried to move but found he was stiff as a board. Even his fingers felt stiff and he had a numb feeling all over.
<br />

<br />
The buckle continued to glow with it's brillant light. Minutes slipped by and Jarred watched his alarm clock on the dresser turn one full hour. Finaly the glow subsided and Jarred felt he could move again.
<br />

<br />
The room looked odd somehow try as he might he could not fix both eyes on the same spot. Jarred lay quiet, almost affraid to look at what might have just occured. He thought to then speak but the words in his head turned out as a low bellow of a bull.
<br />

<br />
Fear as he never had gripped his mind. Try as he might he could not push his elbows into the bed and sit up. His nose seemed wet and runny so he went to wipe it with his wrist. What came into view was a knee and foreleg, cloven hooves and black hair of a bovine animal.
<br />

<br />
Jarred mover to roll out of bed only to be stopped and find himself lying on his side with his head up looking around. The backyard mercury vapor light gave a shadowy outline of a young bull's form. Again he lifted the right foreleg to wipe his runny nose only to catch his hooves in the ring. &quot;Ouch he thought as a short moooing sound was emitted from his mouth.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The human questioning and reasoning mind was now well mixed with that of a bovine bull. As he felt nervous about his sudden change of genius, his tail began to flick about his butt. This movment startled him at first but slowly he found a pleasure in it's rubbing of his now flat out asshole.
<br />

<br />
Inching forward as best he could the desire to stand up on all fours was his primary thought. Wiggling the hind legs closer to the bedside they slowly slipped down to touch the floor. Turning his chest and forelegs round he stretched his body out straight. Lifting his head high he felt the muscle power in his new animal body.
<br />

<br />
In that moment he was so pleased with the strength he felt his bullish self let out a long satisfied bellow.  Even as his wind died off and the bellowing sound rung throughout the house he remembered his predicament.
<br />

<br />
&quot;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!&quot; Jarred's father yelled from his adjoining bedroom. The sound of footsteps coming out in the hallway sent Jarred scrambling for the dark confines of his closet.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Jarred, Jarred, called mister Thomas!&quot;  Yet as he looked in Jarred's room he was nowhere to be seen. &quot;Ma, Jarred's not in his room, I'll look downstairs and out back, called mister thomas to his wife.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Both father and mother got up and looked everywhere but no Jarred. &quot;What the Hell was that noise dear, I could have sworn I heard a cow bellow or something?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh dear come back to bed, Jarred's a good boy and best have a good reason in the morning for being out this late, said the misses.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Jarred stood shaking of fear in the refines of his deep closet. He waited all of an hour before he clopped out and looking down the  hallway ventured out. The stairs were easy as a boy but working four legs, hooves, and balance going down was tuff.
<br />

<br />
At last he was on flat carpet again. Moving around he decided to make his way to the backyard. &quot;I best get out of here, this is no place for a bull thought Jarred.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Again the rear steps were a problem but soon enough his cloven hooves dug into soft earth. Walking again in circles he could not decide where to go. As his human self thought for a direction the bovine part sought for food.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly the light of a rising sun glint in Jarred's eye. The thought of morning hit the boy's thought process and he became awake to his situation again. Looking around he was still on the backyard lawn. The exception to this was he had spent four hours grazing mindlessly as a bull.
<br />

<br />
A feeling of a full stomac Jarred decided his direction should be toward his best friend's farm, the Killingsworth Farm. So he looked the direction of it's closest boarder and jumped and trotted toward it's possible safety.  
<br />

<br />
Jarred had great trouble keeping his mind on getting to the farm. Whenever he stopped to rest he was soon lost to more grazing. The sun was high in the sky and he was only halfway there. The warm sun on his black hairy hide made him feel extra hot and soon enough weary.
<br />

<br />
As he jogged alone the strange feelng of his bullish sexual parts gave a sense of desire. &quot;Strange he thought how being naked and a beast could give me such a feeling of absolute freedom.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Stopping occasionally to drop some manure or take a long hardy pee was somewhat enjoyable to the boyish mind. The five miles to off and on walking finally got the young bull to the East gate of the huge farm.
<br />

<br />
Standing to await someone to come along and shue him inside the fenceline Jarred passed his time eating whatever touched his lips. At last one of the red trucks came along.</p>
