<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday at the FBI&#39;s Seattle Field Office began bright and early. While others got ready for football or simply started their day, they had serious concerns, and they ultimately came down to two things. One was Dymixious Drake, who they had been trying to find after a series of chance occurrences had identified him as the murderer of Lionel Ulysses, and the other were tangential issues that had sprung up in the course of the investigation, namely whatever it was that the investigators felt that Dymixious&#39;s contact, Akane Tachibana, might be hiding. Officially the FBI had the lead in the case, on the basis that Dymixious had murdered someone already wanted in a federal investigation, but the ones who had brought the case to them was the Seattle PD, and that had brought a very cooperative partnership. Agent Peters represented the FBI in this matter while the Seattle Police had two detectives, Holmes and Smith.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how will this work?&quot; Detective Smith as he and Detective Holmes sat down in the chairs opposite Agent Peters desk, &quot;I mean... I had to find it on Google Maps... this Moon Lake place isn&#39;t exactly in our jurisdiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will likely relate to the same cooperation that we had during the arrest of Lionel Ulysses,&quot; Agent Peters answered, &quot;the agent leading that investigation had gotten the Moon Lake Police to cooperate with that operation. If Dymixious is there... or might be there, I can go in and talk with their chief of police. If he&#39;s not aware of Dymixious&#39;s presence... he&#39;ll want to know, and could well cooperate in arresting this Dymixious. That isn&#39;t the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Seattle detectives looked to each other and then shrugged. They did remember the Moon Lake officer being present, but at the same time, they figured that the arrest of Lionel Ulysses went rather well, all things considered. It was something that still puzzled Detective Smith as to why Agent Teddy Green had essentially recruited a Moon Lake officer, only to have that officer do nothing that really stood out from what the other FBI and Seattle officers did during Lionel Ulysses arrest. However, that sort of cooperation could come in handy now if it meant capturing Dymixious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... that makes sense,&quot; Detective Smith gave a small shrug, &quot;but what about what Ms. Tachibana said over the phone? A lot of it sounded like she was trying to hide something... Something that could connect her to Dymixious in some way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was odd,&quot; Detective Holmes agreed, &quot;I mean... she sounded more than willing to see him arrested, but at the same time wanting to hold something back... as though she would be betraying something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way... I agree,&quot; Agent Peters nodded, &quot;but at the same time, we have to remember that all we have that connects Tachibana to Dymixious is his contact number, which from what said seems to be the result of a bad business deal. I can pay Ms. Tachibana a personal visit to try and see if she will clarify some things that she gave us in the phone call... but based on what we have, we have nothing that we can use to get too deeply involved into her affairs. If she doesn&#39;t wish to answer, we really don&#39;t have anything that can justify forcing her. And for the moment, Ms. Tachibana is NOT our concern. Dymixious is.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few heavy sighs but both police detectives eventually nodded and then slumped back in the chair. The phone call had produced some suspicion on certain things, but Agent Peters was correct in that they didn&#39;t have much to really go on. And that beat the purpose of law enforcement. That still left the question of how to handle their next mission.<br />
<br />
&quot;That still leaves us with needing to figure out the plan,&quot; Detective Holmes spoke, &quot;You can&#39;t cut us out of this. It is our case, and if it weren&#39;t for things that came to our attention... we wouldn&#39;t even have a name for who killed Ulysses right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Moon Lake seems to be our only lead at the moment,&quot; Detective Smith added.<br />
<br />
Agent Peters paused to scratch her head and then nodded to them. After all, she had allowed them to be there for the search of Dymixious&#39;s property and it wasn&#39;t in Seattle, either. In the spirit of cooperation they could get along, and if Moon Lake had issue with that, there was the fact that a Moon Lake officer had been asked to participate in the arrest of Lionel Ulysses. In that sense, it would be fair, though at the same time she also knew that there wasn&#39;t that much that could really be done. Much of the trip was based around some base suspicion that something was up based around the phone call they&#39;d made trying to find Dymixious regarding what contacts they knew he had. <br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t much that they could do. In that, much of the present mission wasn&#39;t much more than making sure than making sure that the Moon Lake Police Department cooperated in the overall search for Dymixious, and that was something that would be expected. After all, in pure theory, while local law enforcement often wanted to keep their own jurisdiction protected, Agent Peters had often found that when criminals like Dymixious were involved local law enforcement was more than willing to cooperate. Agent Peters even figured that something like that was highly possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Agent Peters eventually spoke with a small nod &quot;but let&#39;s try to be tactful, here. After all, all we&#39;re really doing is letting their police department know about the possibility that this Dymixious could be in the area. Any request to talk with Tachibana is at best to be a request to clarify things. We DON&#39;T want to rock any boats. And remember, it is to be treated as you cooperating with me. Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both detectives sighed and then nodded in agreement.</p>
