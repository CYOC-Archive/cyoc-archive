<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom took a breath and thought for a moment. <br />
<br />
&#39;What if she was telling the truth?&#39; he thought.<br />
<br />
After talking a hard gulp, Tom slowly got down to his knees and the to his hands before he was on all fours.  Shutting his eyes, he tensed his body, which shook slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Kate asked, taken aback by Tom&#39;s strange actions, much like Matt was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want... I wanna be a donkey,&quot; Tom admitted as quickly as he could, still keeping his eyes closed.  The image in his mind was his grandparent&#39;s prized donkey they always spoke so highly of.  That sort of life he wouldn&#39;t mind, especially if he had no choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing, man?  You&#39;re...&quot; Matt was about to protest when, with a sudden swell, Tom&#39;s ass appeared to grow inside of his jeans.  With every grunt Tom made, his ass grew and grew, looking like firm muscle and lean fat, that was taking his hips as well.  His pj pants weren&#39;t meant to take the size of an equine so they began to rip and tear.  Tom shuttered when he heard the noise. Knowing it was working.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, keep going, Tom,&quot; Kate encouraged, rubbing his head as if he was already an animal.  Tom&#39;s eyes fluttered open before he shut them again to &#39;push&#39; himself along.<br />
<br />
His hips and pelvis started to pop and crack, causing him to waver on his shaky hands and feet, still unchanged.  Still, he kept it together, knowing that his posture was going to have to change.  When there was a final crack, combined with a swell of more weight, Tom&#39;s pj pants went to tatters, leaving just some shreds around his waist.  Matt gasped when it finally saw all of what Tom had done to himself so far.<br />
<br />
While Kate tugged on Tom&#39;s tail, adding &quot;Look like someone is coming along!&quot;, Tom could see a dark streak of skin leading down to a puckered equine asshole.  Further down, growing in between sprouting brown hairs, was a leathery black sex, drooping and hanging on to the remains of a cock.  His legs looking more like hind legs, Tom felt his feet starting to get tight along with all the muscles of his calves.  <br />
<br />
Before Matt could answer the question, following a low grunt, Tom spoke up.  &quot;Does your uncles farm have jack asses?  I think... I think I&#39;m going into heat,&quot; Tom admitted, the ill feeling in his gut actually his ovaries forming.<br />
<br />
Kate, a bit shocked, came around to the backside of Tom and giggled.  &quot;Oh jeez, a jenny?  You chose a jenny?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Tom was about to answer when again he shut his eyes and felt himself tensing.  He pushed but unexpectedly for him, his butthole opened and a stream of turds rolled out to Kate and Matt&#39;s disgust.  Tom wanted to stop but felt both feet burst through his socks, looking almost completely like hooves to match his donkey rear end.  So quickly had the changes taken his legs and ass compared to the front, Tom was walking on his palms with outstretched arms when trying to trot away from his mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez dude,&quot; Matt said, the odor rank and even when Tom seemed to be out, the added hot piss didn&#39;t help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I,&quot; Tom opened his eyes and looked back, unable to understand how so much shit had come out of him. &#39;Get used to it,&#39; he thought to himself.  Taking a breath, upon exhaling he could start to feel his lungs growing.  Ribs cracked to grow and his torso was changing along with a line of dabbled grey and brown fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;But a jenny?&quot; Matt had to ask again, covering his face with his sleeve.<br />
<br />
Tom looked down as a burning had pulled out his nipples to longer, discolored teats.  The swelling behind them was offset by their sliding down his body, soon to be his udders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to get fucked by a donkey,&quot; Tom admitted.  He looked down at his hands and willed, begged, for them to change like the rest of him.  Mercifully, the skin started to pull together while the joints and length of bones in his arms started to adjust as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know they have like, 2 foot dicks, right?&quot; Kate asked, seeing the glimmer of something like shame in Tom&#39;s eye.<br />
<br />
Tom clenched his fists, helping them along with their transformation into hooves.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I want it.  All of it.  To the h-AWWWWW-ilt!&quot; Tom admitted, blushing as soon as the bray came out.  He should his head, smiling.  His glasses fell along with clumps of his hair.  He felt his perspective starting to change as his chest cracked, neck elongated and heart raced.  &quot;And have them cum in me.  To have their foals and- HAWWWWWW- get fucked again!&quot; Tom&#39;s tail lifted as his sex completed it&#39;s adjustment so he could have those very foals now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, stop, you&#39;re scaring me, man,&quot; Matt admitted.<br />
<br />
Tom shut his eyes as a full pain entered his jaw.  It was only after a loud pop and the feeling like his nostrils were being tugged apart that he opened them.  He grinned as best he could when his new muzzle greeted him.  &quot;Stop?&quot; Tom questioned, his voice guttural, and slightly female.  He trotted, slowly and with some slipping hooves, to a mirror in the room to see his face.  &quot;It really is happening,&quot; he said with a struggle while his face pushed out more and more, his teeth tumbling out as new ones came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; was all Matt could say as Tom&#39;s face lost all distinction and humanity.  His ears had grown out and fur was coming in.  <br />
<br />
Tom stepped back from the mirror slowly, the last changes setting in as his mind felt fuzzy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye bye,&quot; Kate said before Tom shut his eye hard.<br />
<br />
When opened again, a dull grown donkey eye stared back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he gone?&quot; Matt asked, the donkey standing there dumbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly,&quot; Kate said, petting the donkey&#39;s mane.  &quot;Once a donkey does the deed on him, er, her, then Tom will be that jenny he wants.&quot;  She turned to Matt, trying to ignore the smell in the room.  &quot;So, that gonna be you?&quot;</p>
