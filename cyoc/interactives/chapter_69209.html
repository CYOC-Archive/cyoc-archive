<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I smiled at her. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said quietly. She glanced over at me, giving me a very cursory look-over <br />
and a curt nod, saying nothing. I don't know whether she could tell by the way I looked at her that I found <br />
her HOT, or if I simply wasn't good looking enough for her...or if she was simply a quiet girl, but that was <br />
all I got. I sighed softly. That was the real bitch about being a lesbian. You might find the perfect girl, <br />
but if her door didn't swing that way, the best you could hope for was a drunken one night stand and awkward <br />
conversation from that point on.<br />
<br />
           &quot;I wish you'd talk to me,&quot; I said, still not thinking about the fact I had the ring.<br />
<br />
           She turned her body toward me immediately. &quot;Hey,&quot; she said with a suddenly friendly smile. &quot;I'm <br />
Alicia.&quot;<br />
<br />
            &quot;Hi!&quot; I replied, almost too eagerly. Now that I was able to get a good look at her without having <br />
to sneak peeks, I realized she was far more attractive than I'd been able to see with simple glances. She had <br />
straight black hair that hung down to mid-chest and mid-back with a few purple streaks thrown in amongst the <br />
black to match her uniform. Her breasts were easily a D cup. She had stunning green eyes and full lips. &quot;I'm <br />
Joella, though most folks just call me Jo.&quot;<br />
<br />
              She spun a finger in her hair, playing with it absentmindedly. &quot;I just moved here..first day of <br />
school,&quot; she said glumly. &quot;Woo-hoo..&quot;  I was staring at her chest. It was impossible for me not to. Alicia was <br />
gorgeous. I mean, I was trying to make eye contact..but it was HARD. Christ, sometimes I'm more sex drive than <br />
personality. (No wonder I'm single...well, that and a couple other reasons, which you'll probably find out <br />
soon enough.) &quot;It's a shame we don't go to the same school; it would be nice to actually have SOMEONE to talk <br />
to,&quot; she added. She seemed to notice where my eyes were wandering and pulled her blazer a bit more closed. Not <br />
all the way, but enough to hide the bulk of her chest. I quickly made a silent wish that we DID attend the <br />
same school. I glanced down and saw we were now wearing matching uniforms, though I didn't have the blazer. <br />
(Nor did I have amazing tits like hers.)<br />
<br />
             She blinked a couple of times in confusion, then hurredly added. &quot;Oh shit..my bad..I guess we do. <br />
Awesome.&quot; She smiled again, and it lit up her face. &quot;I guess I'm not really that observant today.&quot;<br />
<br />
             I smiled back. &quot;It's okay, I forgive ya.&quot; I patted her leg in a friendly manner, and then without  <br />
thinking about it, I just let my hand rest on her thigh. Immediately, she scooted away a few inches, her face <br />
a mixture of shock and uncomfortability. <br />
<br />
             &quot;Look..umm..I'm not into girls,&quot; she said. Her tone was almost apologetic. ALMOST. (Another <br />
reason why I'm single..I have HORRID gaydar. Like seriously..If I like a girl, almost guaranteed she's <br />
straight as an arrow. Meanwhile girls that I don't notice at all are coming out of the closet left and right.)<br />
<br />
            I let out a frustrated sigh. &quot;I wish you were.&quot; In my frustration I'd forgotten about the ring. Of <br />
course, I was immediately reminded of it by the sudden appearance of her hand on top of mine. It wasn't like <br />
she was trying to hold my hand...she was just touching me in a casually friendly way.<br />
<br />
            &quot;Let me rephrase that,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm not into 'girls'&quot; (she made airquotes around &quot;girls&quot;)&quot;The <br />
ones that are all 'ooh, I'm bicurious' and will totally let you lick their slits at a slumber party and then <br />
ignore you at school. I'm not into girls that want to just kiss and make out, but then go frigid the minute <br />
clothes start coming off. I'm not into girls that think I'm the only one that's supposed to eat pussy in the <br />
relationship, and I'm TOTALLY not into girls who simply want to try a three way because their boyfriend <br />
secretly wants to fuck another girl.&quot; She smiled. &quot;I AM into women, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
              I grinned. &quot;Awesome.&quot; I leaned in to kiss her, only to find her pulling away. <br />
<br />
              &quot;You're..not my type..&quot; she said, sounding genuinely apologetic. &quot;Sorry.&quot; Fuck..the story of my <br />
life. It's another one of my drawbacks..that huge sex drive. I can't help it..I REALLY like girls. Like <br />
practically any girl out there, I kind of want to have an experience with. I see them all looking happy with <br />
their men, and I KNOW that I can make them cum harder with my tongue than their boyfriends or husbands do with <br />
their cocks. I meet another lesbian, and I want to feel their bodies, learn their tricks, and show them the <br />
ones that I know. I can't help it. <br />
<br />
              The problem is that I'm cute, but kind of plain. I'm not unattractive, but I'm far from head-<br />
turningly gorgeous. I'm five feet, four inches tall. Short, but not cute and pixie petite like some folks get <br />
into. I've got B cup breasts. Dead average size. Again, they're cute for me, but they're not going to get me a <br />
date. I'm not mind blowingly curvy, not ridiculously thin..I've been told my light freckling is cute. I've <br />
been told that my brown eyes are pretty..but I haven't had anyone get lost in them.<br />
<br />
             Meanwhile, Alicia is insanely hot. She's the sort of lesbian that can get the head cheerleader to <br />
feel experimental. She's the type that gets a girl from curious to lesbian and dumping her boyfriend. She's <br />
the sexy lesbian that every guy wants in his bed, never realizing that he's inviting trouble by letting his <br />
girlfriend get her freak on 'just this one time'. And she's the sort that realizes she can have whoever she <br />
wants. I've met those girls before. I've even been friends with them...but lovers? No, at least not more than <br />
a one-nighter behind closed doors. The only difference between girls like Alicia and lipstick lesbians is that <br />
a legit lesbian hottie will at least try and let you down a little easier.<br />
<br />
          &quot;I wish you were,&quot; I say, kind of bitterly. This time, I haven't forgotten the ring. This wish is my <br />
idea entirely.<br />
<br />
            Alicia immediately leans in closer to me. She wrapped a hand around the back of my neck and pulls <br />
me toward her. &quot;You're not my type...unless you use tongue on the first kiss,&quot; she said with a smile, then <br />
pressed her soft lips against mine and immediately pushed her tongue into my mouth. Oh man...the kiss was <br />
awesome. Fireworks were going off in my brain, and my heart was pounding. THIS. WAS. AWESOME!! Like seriously, <br />
on the kiss scale, it was easily a nine. I swear, I almost came a little. It definitely got me insta-wet. That <br />
kiss went on forever, I know..but it still didn't feel long enough when we stopped. It was damn near <br />
perfection in kiss form.<br />
<br />
         &quot;I wish you'd skip school with me.&quot; I stood up, already knowing what her answer would be.<br />
<br />
         &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; she said, asking &quot;So..where to?&quot;</p>
