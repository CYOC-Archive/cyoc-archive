<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the rest oft he week, AME collected more and more slaves, as nobody was able to stop him. The sexslaves were mostly inactive, as not ordered to do anything. Some deep down settings in their reprogrammed mind let them fill their human body needs like eating, but that happened without them raising from their mental slumber. The others worked on their assigned duties, or were also in stand-by.<br />
When the week ended and the AME turned back fully into Dean, it was some getting used to after being mostly unaware. He had gained the knowledge what the AME did, and after working it out for himself, he used the chronivac to change a couple of things. Most of the slaves were returned to normal, as the AME had been connected to the chronivac and all their former data was saved. Dean only erased the new memories, as well as two minutes before the AME approached them. So in the end, nobody of them remembered anything they had done in their time as slaves, or being such.<br />
He made only a couple of exceptions. These were all the members of Jeff&#39;s family, as well as his own two siblings Aaron and Cindy. He used the chronivac to give himself some of the skills he had as the AME, such as injecting the drug if he wanted to, or reassemble his slaves. With that, he gave his slaves their names back, as well as most of their memories, but let the slave-personality in control, and made them unable to protest about it. He could activate their slave-selfs if needed, and when put in stand-by they returned to normal mostly.<br />
He let both Jeff and Richie remain sexslaves, as he liked the idea of having two of them. Cindy remained his maid if needed, but got the number one instead of her seven. Aaron was turned from yet another sexslave, which Dean found disgusting by now to think of him, into the new mechanican. While Kate was reassembled from maid to gardener to replace Harold, Harold himself was now a protector and teacher to him.<br />
When he was satisfied with their new roles, he used the chronivac to make it normal to others what the six of them were, so nobody would question him. He also altered his ability to convert someone into a slave a bit, so that while they changed into one others would see that as normal as well.<br />
His life was better now, as most of it was taking care of. And with two eager people he could use as he needs, he couldn´t be happier.<br />
At the same time Jeff was furios at Dean. At least for the week he had no recollection what had happened with him, but now he regained this knowledge and was also aware when Dean switched him into slave mode. And he couldn´t fight it off. He had wanted to attack Dean while he slept after Jeff had pleasured him, but as Dean never send him to stand-by and therefore freed him, he was stuck at pleasuring him the whole night. When the next day Dean used Richie instead of him, he tried again, but quickly noticed he couldn´t harm Dean in any way, something that was rooted deep in his mind with „You can´t harm your master“. Getting another idea, Jeff tried to use the chronivac, but Dean had made sure none of his slaves could access it. So he was stuck.<br />
The others weren´t any better, but also didn´t know about the program. Richie had tried to attack Dean on the first day as Jeff couldn´t, but realized the same thing as Jeff. Cindy noticed she couldn´t harm him as she tried to stab him after she had to serve him dinner before being freed. <br />
When Aaron tried to sabotage something he had repaired just before to harm Dean, it had backfired. Aaron had another programmed thing to activate his slave mode, and that would let him repair anything he found to be damaged. So when he sabotaged a tool Dean could use later, just after doing so he started repairing it again, which frustrated him even more.<br />
Kate and Harold hadn´t exactly accepted their new status, but hadn´t tried to harm Dean.<br />
And so life continued for Dean and his slaves.</p>
