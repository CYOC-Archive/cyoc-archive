<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Many ideas were going through Jackson&#39;s head while he was setting up for the party. Mostly those of how to transform his guests. He had schemes like making people a year younger when they drink from a glass of wine. Although he decided against going that route as that was too random of a change. Oh well, perhaps another time when he gets more experienced using the Chronivac, but for now, it was best to focus on just Oliver and Percy.<br />
<br />
The question Jackson had, now, was whether or not he was going to tell those two he was transforming them or not. While he would like to have some confidants in his Chronivac transforming adventures, he also wanted to see a person&#39;s reaction to be transformed over time. Ultimately, Jackson decided to tell Percy and not tell Oliver, at least not at first. If only because he thought Oliver&#39;s reactions would be more interesting than Percy&#39;s. <br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
After planning out his ideas more, it wasn&#39;t long before the first guests arrived, and it happened to be Oliver and Lilah, who happened to look quite shocked at how Jackson looked. How fortunate for the socialite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackson? Is that really you? You look great, but damn... how did you...&quot; Oliver started to say in awe and confusion before he got cut off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, I know I look good,&quot; Jackson said as he vainly ran a hand through his rejuvenized thick hair. &quot;I&#39;ve been chosen to participate in a new lifestyle program, and think they&#39;ve done a pretty good job. I can&#39;t share many details now, though. Non-disclosure agreements, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judging by the looks on their faces, it seems like Oliver and Lilah believed that, or a the very least didn&#39;t want to ask more questions. Great, this was working out better than he expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, from the looks of things, it seems to have been a very effective program,&quot; Lilah cheerfully responded. &quot;Perhaps when it&#39;s available to the general public, we&#39;ll try it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan, Lilah. Perhaps I can hook you two up with a discount. Anyway, I have to take care of something before everyone else arrives. Why don&#39;t you two help yourself to some refreshments while you wait for the others to arrive?&quot;<br />
<br />
The husband and wife followed his advice and walked off, and once they were far enough away, Jackson pulled out the device and brought up Oliver&#39;s profile. The socialite decided it would be better to start with a small change, especially with all the guests he invited. So, he decided to shave off ten years from Oliver over the course of the party. If he recalled correctly, that wasn&#39;t quite far back enough to fix his knee, but small steps, especially around his wife.<br />
<br />
As more and more guests came to the party more, and more curious eyes fell to Jackson&#39;s new form, and he was loving every minute of it. All those people complimenting him on his youthful look, it made him feel so sexy. All of them were also beliving the lifestyle program story. Jackson had to wonder what he was going to tell them when a lifestyle program doesn&#39;t materialize. Though perhaps all of them will get to experience the real &quot;lifestyle program&quot; one day.<br />
<br />
Jackson also occasionally glanced over at Oliver once and a while. He noticed that his friend look a bit younger and more energetic as time went on. Although most people wouldn&#39;t see those small changes unless you were looking for them at this point. Oliver certainly didn&#39;t seem to notice his changes just yet, but the party had just begun.<br />
<br />
A little while later, Percy had arrived fashionably late, and the same song and dance happened with the other guests. Percy being shocked by Jackson&#39;s appearance and Jackson explaining it away with a fictional lifestyle program. However, this time, Jackson added to his cover story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;m not supposed to show anyone this, but since you&#39;re my friend, I don&#39;t think it would hurt to give you a little preview. What do you say, Percy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! I&#39;d say I&#39;d love to see a preview of your new lifestyle, and the future of my new lifestyle as well. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m not going to use that lifestyle program after I&#39;ve seen what it did for you.&quot; Oh Percy, if only you knew what was in store for you. <br />
<br />
Jackson leads his unaware friend to a private room where the primary device was stored.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here it is. Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot; Jackson said, knowing full well that Percy would be confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, isn&#39;t this just a computer? Are you going to do something with it and show me a preview on it or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, no need to rush, old friend. Don&#39;t you know that the best things come to those who wait?&quot; Jackson teased as he sat down and started to type something up on the Chronivac. &quot;By the way. When did you start dying your hair purple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What the hell are you talking about, Jackson? You know, you&#39;ve been acting weird since we got here. This lifestyle program better not involve dru-AHH!&quot; Percy yelped as he curiously turned to the mirror to find that his hair was, in fact, purple. Which caused Jackson to chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were always a bold one, Percy, but I don&#39;t think this color suits you.&quot; Jackson once again typed something, and Percy&#39;s hair was magically back to its regular color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you&#39;re the one who changed my hair?! No, the computer did! So that means that you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always the sharp one, Percy. Yes, this little computer program here can change people, and I used it to make myself younger and stronger than I was before.  How about you? Do you want me to do the s-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Percy yelled out, interrupting Jackson without a second thought. Percy desperately wanted to go back to his younger days, maybe even be a model again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Impatient again, huh? Alright, alright, I&#39;m changing you to my current age, 35.&quot; Jackson typed into the program for a regression to age 35 over ten minutes for Percy. Once he confirmed the changes, Percy instantly felt a tingly feeling and ran to the mirror. There he saw as his clock started to tick backward as his hairline came back and wrinkles starting to disappear, but then turned towards Jackson with a wry grin on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jackson. After this is done, why don&#39;t we go to the bedroom and... enjoy are youth together.&quot; Jackson knew that look that Percy had on his face when he asked him that question. It was the look that he used to seduce people. He predicted that Percy might come on to him, but he didn&#39;t expect him to come on this strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Percy, you know I don&#39;t swing that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, not now. But with this device, you can change it so that you do, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson was quite surprised that he had said that. Not only did he see that as an option while he was browsing, but Jackson was also kind of curious about what that would be like. After thinking it over for a while, he finally gave Percy an answer.</p>
