<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly the door swung open and a figure barged into the room.  All I heard was, “You know it’s bad enough I have to pretend to not be able to hear you masturbate so loudly but now all I hear is a bunch of screaming and laughing.  What the hell is going on?”<br />
<br />
A girl I had never before seen had just burst into the room to apparently complain about the noise.  This girl appeared to be the same age as Carrie.  She was also very attractive with bright red hair, a pretty face and what appeared to be D-cup breasts.  She wore a low-cut top that accentuated her generous breasts, to be sure.  I pulled out the piece of paper from my pocket in order to see if I could guess who this person was.<br />
<br />
As I removed the paper from my pocket I didn’t stop looking at this new girl.  It was a good thing I did not, for the sight of three naked girls, two of them with cocks, would have shocked anyone.  The moment the girl caught sight of that fact she froze dead in her tracks.  Her jaw dropped and color seemed to fade from her face.  It looked as if she was about to scream and I saw her flinch in the direction of the door.  As fast as I could I shouted, “I wish you would not scream and would not be able to move your feet!”  The girl confirmed my suspicions by turning her upper body toward the door and moving her mouth as if to scream.  But my wish took care of both problems as no sound came from her and her feet acted as if they were cement blocks.<br />
<br />
I moved quickly to the door to close it so that no one else might unexpectedly enter the room.  Carrie and Shanelle scurried for their robes and put them back on.  Juliet dove behind the bed as she tried to find her clothes.  As I closed the door I heard Carrie shout, “This is why it’s impolite not to knock, Brianna!”<br />
<br />
Now that I knew that this was Brianna, one of Juliet’s tormentors, I knew I would have to take decisive action.  “So this is one of the girls that’s been harassing you, Juliet?” I called to her.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes,” she whimpered.  The sudden appearance of someone she clearly feared and that person seeing her naked obviously unnerved poor Juliet.<br />
<br />
“Juliet, calm down, it’s OK,” I assured her.  She seemed to comply with my request.<br />
<br />
“Joe, get rid of her or something,” Carrie demanded.<br />
<br />
“No, we have to think of something else,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Who the hell are you?” Brianna demanded of me.  “What in the fuck is going on in here?”<br />
<br />
“Brianna, I’ll explain as much as I want to, but for right now I wish you would shut up!” I exclaimed.  Brianna instantly shut her mouth and looked very surprised at this fact.  I turned back to Carrie as I examined my list.  “So this is Brianna, supporter of…Stacey, is it?”<br />
<br />
“No, Roxanne,” she said.<br />
<br />
I was confused.  “I thought you said Stacey was the name of the girl that was running against you,” I said.<br />
<br />
Carrie shook her head.  “No, she’s someone who’s probably voting for Roxanne.  If I said Stacey before, I messed up,” she explained.<br />
<br />
I looked over my list carefully to find that Carrie was right.  There was a Stacey on the list of residents, and my list told me she was voting for Roxanne.  I also noticed that the list now indicated Juliet was going to vote for Carrie rather than being undecided.  So that meant it was 6-5 in favor of Carrie with an undecided.  I had three of the Carrie votes in this room.  I was going to have to get to Roxanne’s supporters at some point, so I thought of a new idea.<br />
<br />
“Carrie, when is vote for head of house,” I asked.<br />
<br />
She chuckled.  “Believe it or not, it’s tonight,” she said.  “We’re all going to gather in the common room and vote one at a time.  Since we’re self run, this is the only way to ensure there’s no cheating.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” I said.  “We can use this little distraction to our advantage.”  I turned my attention back to the frozen in place Brianna.  “Now, as for you…I’m sorry, but I’m afraid I lied to you.  I’m not going to let you speak again while you’re in this room.  Let me give you a quick explanation.  What you saw was real.  Don’t worry, your housemates are real women, but they’ve been enhanced by me.  I have the ability to grant wishes.  That’s why you can’t move, scream or speak right now.”<br />
<br />
I had to pause for a minute.  “Here’s what’s going to happen now, Brianna.  I’m going to send you back to your room.  But I have a few wishes for you.  When it comes time to vote for head of house tonight, I wish you would vote for Carrie.  Once Roxanne finds out about this, I wish you will act like you don’t know why you did this.  Also when this happens, I wish that you will remove all of your clothes.  I wish that once you are naked, you will grow a cock just like Carrie and Shanelle have done.  Once you have grown your cock I wish that you will be happy to follow Carrie’s instructions as it pertains to the sorority.”<br />
<br />
Brianna looked absolutely aghast at everything I just said.  Try as she might, and I assumed she did, she could not find the ability to speak or scream.  “Now that you know what will happen, I wish that you will now be able to move your feet again and I wish for you to turn around and go back to your room.  I wish that you will then be able to speak again, but I wish for you to have absolutely no memory of coming into Carrie’s room and to ignore anything else you hear happen in this room today.”<br />
<br />
Once my exhaustive wish was completed Brianna, eyes still as wide as could be, turned around, walked to the door, opened it and left.<br />
<br />
“Jeez, that was close,” Carrie said once Brianna was gone.<br />
<br />
“Nothing that the ring couldn’t handle,” I said.  “We’ve got a lot of work to do now.”</p>
