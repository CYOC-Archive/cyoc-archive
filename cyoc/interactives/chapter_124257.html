<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were several things that Effie Wilcox was glad her granddaughter, Heather, didn&#39;t inherit from her. For one thing, Effie had never been much of a Southern belle. In fact, she was rather homely, even when she was young. The fact that she had heterochromia made her even less settling to look at. As such, it wasn&#39;t until later in life that she had found a husband, which was more of a marriage of convenience and economics than romance. Effie was actually grateful that Heather ended up taking more after her mother in appearance than herself. It wasn&#39;t until later in life that Effie learned she had a snake-heart instead of a normal human heart. She didn&#39;t tell Heather about it because she feared Heather would constantly worry if she had one too or her children would get it.<br />
<br />
Effie was certainly glad that Heather had more of a free spirit than she had at her age. Oh, things were a lot different back when Effie was young. Women rights were not really as good as they were these days. Her homely looks were a very considerable hampers as that what men cared about more than skills. She basically had to live with her parents until she was married off. At least her husband had a small plantation in Alabama that Effie could manage. But by now, her husband was long dead and the plantation was noting but a bunch of flats she was the landlady for. Heather was born into a much more open society and was intending to earn a living with the art she made. It made Effie so proud that Heather was able to get an internship in Costa Rica.<br />
<br />
But then Heather disappeared for a long time. Effie didn&#39;t hear anything from her, no phone calls, no letters. It made her quite worried what happened to her granddaughter. Needless to say, she was less than pleased when she finally learned what happened. She didn&#39;t own a TV or a computer so it took her a lot longer than it should have for her to hear what Heather had done. It was shocking enough that Heather had become sort of living dinosaur, but she had attacked a schoolgirl with the intent to kill and eat her. Effie thought she had raised Heather better than that. Where had she gone wrong? Civilized people don&#39;t try and kill for revenge, let alone eat them. Heather was going to get a very long lecture from her granny when she got a hold of her, dinosaur or not. (And why would Heather make herself into a dinosaur for anyways? Dinosaurs are for boys.)<br />
<br />
It was a bit surprising when Animalia finally contacted Effie. Not just because of how long it took, but because they had something more in mind than just reuniting her with her granddaughter (who deserved a good hiding in her opinion). Apparently, they wanted her help in some sort of mad science something or other. Effie couldn&#39;t make heads or tails of what they told her in her letter, but they were paying for her air fare and that was enough for her to go to Nevada.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;So let me see if I&#39;ve got this straight,&quot; said Effie, after a very long scientific rigamarole, &quot;You&#39;re sayin&#39; my heart could allow me to become a dinosaur?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The DNA that gives your heart your atavistic aorta arrangement,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;Heather must be a carrier for that specific gene which gave the fossilized DNA a link to bind to hers and form a functional recombiant sequence from multiple theropod specimens.&quot; Jeremy frowned in annoyance at the utterly baffled look on Effie&#39;s face. &quot;Ok, where did I lose you this time?&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first time you said &#39;DNA&#39;,&quot; said Effie.<br />
<br />
Jeremy threw up his hands in frustration and snapped, &quot;Can someone else explain it to this old fossil?&quot;<br />
<br />
Effie glared before wapping Jeremy over the head with her cane. &quot;Respect your elders, young man,&quot; she snapped.<br />
<br />
Dr. Stein sighed and said, &quot;The most abbreviated version is that Heather inherited something from you that might have allowed her to be able to transform into a dinosaur and we would like your help to find out what that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you need me fer?&quot; asked Effie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samples of your blood so that we can see if it&#39;s the key,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s also the matter of your granddaughter,&quot; said the man who said he was from the NSA. Personally, Effie thought he was one of those &#39;men in black&#39; that young people talked about. Though why he was concerned with recreating dinosaurs instead of covering up alien activity, Effie couldn&#39;t fathom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m definitely gonna give her a talkin&#39; to,&quot; said Effie, &quot;Her ears will be blue by the time I&#39;m finished with her.&quot; She paused before asking, &quot;Does she still have ears?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not externally, but I think you&#39;ll be more effective at disciplining her if you were on equal footing,&quot; said the man in black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; asked Effie.<br />
<br />
&quot;What he means is that, if you would permit, we&#39;d do more than test your blood. We&#39;d like to see if you are capable of making a similar change to Heather&#39;s,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
Effie gaped as she grasped what they were asking of her. Turn herself into a dinosaur? Well, Effie had to admit, she was a bit envious of how the Animalians were so fit and strong. And she heard that it could make people young again. Though if Effie had her pick, she&#39;d have wanted something more feminine than a dinosaur. Perhaps a bird of some kind. But then she had a faint recollection that birds were dinosaurs somehow. Well, one thing&#39;s for certain, someone would need to keep an eye on Heather. &quot;Well, I suppose it is my fault I didn&#39;t raise Heather right enough to not try and eat people,&quot; said Effie, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll help ya&#39;ll along with your science project.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, there&#39;s just a matter of a few papers to sign and we start your conversion right away,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Soon, Effie was moved to another room to give her more space to change. She was sure there was someone watching and recording all this. Presently, Jeremy entered the room with a tourniquet and two syringes filled with a red substance. &quot;Ok, this is Heather&#39;s blood. If we&#39;re right, it&#39;ll allow you to change where she couldn&#39;t change others,&quot; said Jeremy as he got the tourniquet fastened and tightened. &quot;You may wish to strip as soon as you can,&quot; he said as he got the first syringe ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sonny, I don&#39;t strip for nobody but my doctor and you sure ain&#39;t my doctor,&quot; said Effie, barely phased when she was injected.<br />
<br />
Jeremy shrugged and said, &quot;Suit yourself. It&#39;ll come to the same end anyways.&quot; As soon as he injected the second dose of blood, he quickly left the room.<br />
<br />
Effie didn&#39;t think much of what Jeremy said until she felt hot and itchy. She soon noticed that red scales were appearing on her arms as well as the veins and liver spots disappearing. The flabbiness of her arms were disappearing as well as her skin became taught and muscles started to fill in. Effie&#39;s spine, shrunken and crooked by arthritis, straightened itself with several loud clicks. Effie was soon noticing that she was standing taller than she ever had before. The reason why became clear when her shoes burst open. Strangely, her big toe was now her littlest as it slid up her lifting ankle to become a dewclaw. Her littlest toe was swallowed up by its neighbor as the toes remaining at the end of her feet changed into large claws. Similarly, her pinky fingers were absorbed into her ring fingers as her hands became reptilian claws.<br />
<br />
Effie soon felt a discomfort in her mouth. She hacked until she spat out her dentures. Her mouth didn&#39;t remain toothless for long as sharp fangs started pushing through her gums. As it became more than her mouth could contain, her face started stretching forward. Her wispy white hair felt out as red scales started spreading over her head and her ears shrank until they were nothing but small holes in her head. A pair of small horns appeared over her eye ridges as if to make up the difference while spikes started forming on her scalp and going down her spine, poking holes in the dress that was suddenly too small for her.<br />
<br />
The destruction of Effie&#39;s dress was accelerated as something started pushing out of her lower back. Before long, it was revealed as the back of her dress split open, allowing her new tail to grow out. Effie let out an involuntary growl as her remaining clothes became too uncomfortable. Her panties were becoming too tight as her hips grew larger and wider, her rear losing its sag. And Effie never boasted a buxom figure, her breasts remaining rather small even before old age made them droopy. But now they were regaining their perkiness before filling up more than her bra was designed to take. Effie&#39;s frustration made her forget all about the fact she was being watched and her claws made very short work of her clothes.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t just the smallness of her clothes that was frustrating Effie. She was feeling a heat inside of her, a fire that hasn&#39;t lit up in many years. She gave soft hisses of pleasures as she fondled her growing breasts with her four-fingered hands. She could actually feel them getting larger in her palms. But touching her breasts only got her so far. Her vagina had awakened after so many years and it was burning for need. Effie put one hand down to stroke it, only to hiss in pain as her new claws nearly scratched herself. She tried to put her hand to use, but her four fingers were clumsier than they were before and her claws were painful against her sensitive flesh. &quot;C&#39;mon, c&#39;mon...&quot; she growled, her voice much deeper and less quaky than before. While her arms had not shrunk like a real tyrannosaur&#39;s, they were currently just as unable to relieve her need. Glancing around for something she could use, Effie spotted her dropped cane. She picked it up, noticing how much smaller it looked now. Well, she didn&#39;t need it to walk anymore, but she did have one last use for it. She rubbed the end of it against her slit, hissing with pleasure as she got it nice and lubed. Then she started pushing it deep into her folds.<br />
<br />
Effie let out lustful growls as she used her cane as an impromptu dildo. She had pushed asides all thoughts of modesty or care that she was being watched. If she was thinking about it, she&#39;d find the fact that people were watching rather arousing. But right now, all she was focused on was groping one of her breasts while thrusting her cane into her pussy. She barely paid attention to her continuing transformation. The scales had completely covered her body at this point, being mostly scarlet in color though deepening to a blood red in spots, mostly concerning her back sides. The spikes had finished forming down her back and on her shoulders and elbows. Her face had fully extended into a fang-filled muzzle, completing her saurian look. The only thing remaining of her human features was that her eyes were still different colors, blue and green. But what she was not fully aware of was that she was still growing. Unknowingly, she was reaching Heather&#39;s size before surpassing it. She was now larger than her granddaughter in height, curves, and muscles. But all that mattered was that Effie was close to her release. Finally, with a loud, thundering roar, Effie came, her breasts squirting milk as her relatively-minuscule cane was ejected by a flood of juice from her pussy.<br />
<br />
After several deep breaths, Effie tried to stand up. However, that wasn&#39;t as simple as it used to be anymore. Well, before, she needed her cane to stand back up, but now she had completely new legs and a tail to consider. And it turned out that standing up wouldn&#39;t have done a lot of good because now she was taller than the ceiling allowed her to stand straight. Eventually, Effie became aware of the door opened, her enhanced nostrils picking up the scent of man. She looked towards the door to see Dr. Stein standing there. She didn&#39;t bother trying to cover her body. Effie felt a new pride in herself now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would say that this was a rousing success,&quot; said Dr. Stein, looking at the large saurian in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t disagree with you there, doc,&quot; said Effie, her voice deeper, but more melodious than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose now, you&#39;ll want to talk with Heather,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I certainly do,&quot; said Effie with a slight growl. Despite the rush of power she felt, knowing how much stronger she was than any human, she still didn&#39;t condone with Heather&#39;s actions. Effie was definitely going to set her straight on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure you will think of an appropriate punishment for her,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
Effie was fully intent on it too. She had already heard about Heather&#39;s previous punishments, how she was humiliated and humbled. Now Effie had to make sure her last punishment would set the final nail in her granddaughter&#39;s over-inflated ego. At her current size, Effie could probably turn Heather over her knee and spank like she used to when Heather was a naughty little girl. But that didn&#39;t seem right nor great enough a punishment to really make the humiliation sink in. But then Effie thought of something. Earlier, she would have recoiled from something so shameless and dirty. But her new self was finding the idea very, very appealing. She turned to Dr. Stein with a sneaky grin that showed her many sharp teeth. &quot;Now that you mention it, doc, I got a little ol&#39; idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Setting up the riddle hunt was easy enough. The locations weren&#39;t just to make Heather feel tired from all the running around, but to introduce her to individuals who would help her see the error of her ways. Steven&#39;s story will help Heather realize that attacking a student, especially one who had someone very close to them, was so wrong and what she nearly robbed Sophie and Roland of. Iphis and Ianthe will make her see that Heather was not the freak she had doomed herself into being as there were stranger creatures than her and they were able to live successful lives.<br />
<br />
While Effie&#39;s lecturing of Heather was expected, her choice of the final indignity was rather surprising. As a matter of fact, pretty much everything about Tyra Wrex (her old name being too &#39;fuddy-duddy&#39; for new self) was surprising. For starters, at 11 feet tall, she was now the largest Animalian currently existing. The reason she was larger than Heather is presumably because while Tyra had been give a double-dose, Heather had only been exposed once. She also had more than enough muscles to qualify her as an ultra heavyweight bodybuilder, though her amazing curves were not overshadowed. While it was not yet verified, it was quite likely that Tyra now had the largest breasts of any Animalian. And she was more than eager to show off her amazonian body as she danced in a fur bikini on the Meat Market&#39;s stage.<br />
<br />
The considerable shift in personality from Effie Wincox to Tyra Wrex was a very astounding change, particularly for Heather. While youthened conversions were known to be more loose and fun-loving (Simon&#39;s mom being a good example), Tyra was taking this to an unexpected level. The current theory was that conversion into a <i>Syntixisaurus rex</i> (a name coined to describe Heather&#39;s theropod hybridization meaning &#39;fusion lizard king&#39;) loosened the inhibitions of a person with the restructuring of their brains. In Heather&#39;s case, her murderous impulses were giving less restriction while Tyra had lost almost all sexual shame or sense of modesty. Obviously, there was more to learn of the repercussions of hybridizing saurian DNA, but the important part was that Heather was humbled enough to be given a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
