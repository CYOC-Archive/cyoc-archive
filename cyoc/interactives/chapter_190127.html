<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Les was not making much progress in the woods. The pain in her feet and ankles was getting worse, and now her thighs were starting to burn. she was at least out of sight of the house however, now hidden in the dense foliage of the forest. The dark night sky helped conceal her, but didn&#39;t help her find her way through the forest. Everything seemed dark and lost in the shadows that She tripped more than a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leslie, stop! You&#39;re going to get us both killed! &quot; Jeff yelled. she tripped a third time, sending both of them sprawling on the ground. Jeff scrambled to get away, but Les quickly caught hold of him again. He felt smaller in her hands, and it was easier to keep him in her grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leslie, please just let me go. You don&#39;t need me anymore. &quot; said Jeff calmly, yet Leslie ignored his request.<br />
<br />
Just a few minutes ago, she had heard stomping in the brush nearby, and knew Jeff&#39;s sister Elizabeth was still in hot pursuit nearby. Her injuries had slowed her running that Liz was sure to have caught up to her by now, As she was probably even angrier now. She knew that she couldn&#39;t outrun her, She had to hide. She saw a large opening in the ground which lead to an underground cave.<br />
<br />
She trudged uneasily into the cave, while dragging Jeff with her. once Inside the cave that it was even darker then what it seemed. She couldn&#39;t see her hands in front of her face though as She tightened her grip on Jeff, assuring herself that he had not escaped.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll, let&#39;s just wait here until she leaves. Then you can go. I&#39;m not gonna hurt you, I promise. &quot; she said, relaxing a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I find that hard to believe? &quot; said Jeff with resignation.<br />
<br />
Les was a little insulted. &quot;What do you mean? I&#39;m a nice person. I don&#39;t even want to hurt people. &quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed. &quot;Leslie, you&#39;re a bully. You hurt people every day. Why should you treat me any differently?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t here anything for awhile though. he was expecting a punch, a smack, or even anything at this point any second now. however, he heard instead was her softly crying that Her reaction took him off by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leslie, you okay?&quot; Jeff asked, now being more concerned to her then before.<br />
<br />
Leslie tried to restrain herself from her sniffles. &quot;What do you care? You&#39;re just like everyone else! You only see somebody with muscles and just assume I&#39;m some bully that would picks on people, even hurt them. And since of course that I&#39;m girl with muscles, I must be some kind of evil bitch. a monster&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff realized that she was right for When he first saw Leslie, all he could see was a big pile of muscle. He was afraid of her, just because she could easily hurt him. Before today, she had never actually done anything bad to him personally. He just assumed that she was bad news because of the rumors and stories he had heard about her.<br />
<br />
Now that he thought about it, he couldn&#39;t remember Leslie ever actually physically assaulting anyone, much less getting into a fight. She just hung around Brittany, looking intimidating that Jeff decided to reach out through the darkness, and gently touched her shoulder. It was much bigger than he imagined, and the fur didn&#39;t seem that thick as his sisters. &quot;Leslie, I&#39;m sorry. truly I am. It was wrong of me to judge you by your appearance. you have to admit though, you do keep poor company around you. What do you expect people will think of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leslie scoffed. &quot;I keep poor company? I should worry about what other people will think of me? Do you know what it was like for me, before I met Brittany? I was always smaller than everybody else, the runt of the class. All the other girls made fun of me, not to mention none of the boys were interested in a girl with a flat chest. I used to get beat up a lot. I hoped that I would eventually get a growth spurt, or something and catch up with everyone else. however it never really happened to me, nothing at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I decided to take matters into my own hands, and started working out - a lot. not only did I found that my body really respond to exercise, but I actually enjoyed it as I felt better about myself with each work out I did. Of course, this didn&#39;t stop the girls from making fun of me that the boys from before started avoiding the &#39;muscle chick&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My favorite part was the dyke comments however that Everyone assumed since I didn&#39;t have a boyfriend and I had a lot of muscle, I must of been gay while being a strong athlete to them. Yeah, this has nothing to do with me feeling better about yourself, or even making yourself to look better and healthier. Any girl with muscle must be a super athlete while being called gay that Everyone kept calling me Les the Lesbian. such creativity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed a little, ashamed that he had indeed assumed the same thing. He did had used the name once before though, yet never to her face of course. it was mostly behind her back though, back when he was making fun of her with his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;it was Then that I met with Brittany, and she shortly made all of it stop. She saw something special in me I guess, as She took me under her wing. she taught me how to dress while helping me to act more like a lady that she even made sure to anyone who was mean to me, or even talked badly about me regretted it later. After I hooked up with her that everyone suddenly started to treat me very nicely and with some respect. She can be really bossy, and kinda mean even, but she was the only one who treated me like a real person that I am, and not not some freak. all I had to do for her through this deal was to stand by around while acting tough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was touched. &quot;ok, I&#39;m i&#39;m really, very sorry to you Leslie. I never knew about this, how tough it was for you. I guess I was just as bad as everyone else, making assumptions without ever getting to know the real you. guess it&#39;s true to what say, can&#39;t judge a book by its covers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you weren&#39;t so bad for I don&#39;t even remember you ever insulting me. not even before when I first met Brittany. You were the only person that I know who has never called me Les. You always call me Leslie, and I really appreciate that, &quot; said Leslie.<br />
<br />
She ducked down her head a little, embarrassed. &quot;It wasn&#39;t my idea to - well, you know - do what we did to you today. yet Brittany, made me. She threatened to stop hanging out with me and being my friend if I didn&#39;t help out. she&#39;s the only friend I&#39;ve got left, really. I didn&#39;t want to be alone, not anymore. I meant about what I&#39;ve said - we weren&#39;t going to hurt you for It was just supposed to be a few pictures, and then to let you go, no harm would be done. We had no idea as to what would happen ..... about what your semen could do. I mean, how could we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff remained silent. &quot;the only that I hit you was because you wouldn&#39;t stop struggling, and I was also afraid for if I couldn&#39;t hold onto you. Brittany would have never forgiven me if I let you get away. I hope it didn&#39;t hurt you. I wasn&#39;t trying to hurt you, really. I didn&#39;t even used my full strength. Could you ever forgive me as to what I&#39;ve done?&quot;<br />
<br />
After a long pause, Jeff quietly said, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll forgive you. I don&#39;t condone what you did, but I do understand why you did it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she realized that she no longer had Jeff in her grasp. During their conversation that she had been distracted by the strange sensations running over her body. She had let go of him so she could rub her feet. She noted, with some excitement, that her foot was now much wider, and now ended in four toes. The toenails were still long, but at least her body was starting to look more human for It was looking like the program was actually going to work after all.<br />
<br />
For some reason though, she was a little embarrassed to tell Jeff now. Her desire for power seemed like the wish come true for a child who no longer wanted to be bullied, ever again. She now realized that it seemed kind of silly now. You didn&#39;t need power to feel safe and protected. all You just needed, was a few good friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did let go of you some time ago. I can&#39;t see anything in this darkness, but You could of have escaped so easily. Why are you still here? Why did you stay?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed. &quot;Let&#39;s just say that I&#39;m starting to feel a little guilty now. You seem like a really nice person who got a really rotten deal. It seemed like you needed a sympathetic ear tonight, to work some things out that I thought it was the least to what I could do to help you. Besides, I kinda like you now. on that note, I don&#39;t want my sister to ever hurt you not this time. it&#39;s not that She&#39;s bad either, but she did looked pretty mad out there. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Jeff, &quot; said Leslie with genuine affection. &quot;You know, you&#39;re not such a bad guy after all. You&#39;re actually pretty nice, for a guy. I kinda like you too... and I do like having you around. Maybe I&#39;ll just keep you. &quot; said Les with strange smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw, haw! very funny. Let&#39;s just get some sleep. It&#39;s too dark right now to find our way back home through the forest tonight. We&#39;ll find our way back in the morning, when we have better lighting out. &quot; said Jeff, as he curled up and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
Leslie curled up too, with a surprisingly flexible back for a horse. She watched Jeff drift off to sleep as Her body felt really good (probably because of my growth, she thought). however, looking at Jeff made her feel good in a different way that He wasn&#39;t bad looking, for a guy for this is what she decided.<br />
<br />
He was scrawny, but there was some muscle on that thin frame for His body was actually kind of feminine as he was almost like a Bish&#333;nen. still, in the right light that he could almost be passed up for girl for His skin was so smooth and soft like a girl even. Yeah, she decided that he was pretty attractive for she might like having a cute boyfriend like him.<br />
<br />
starting to drift off to sleep too, Leslie&#39;s body transformation begins to accelerate in the dark of the night, just outside the forest and in the cave.</p>
