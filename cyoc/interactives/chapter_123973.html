<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle snoozed, it was the best sleep he had had in years. Jen on the other hand was completely awake, with enough time to herself in his slumber to think of everything that she would have to get for them to keep this body up. Everything from clothing to feminine hygiene products, she had already determined after an hour of him sleeping that she wouldn&#39;t hold anything against him, she was his owner now, and she felt somewhat complimented by what he had said while they enjoyed themselves. <br />
<br />
Somehow, Jen knew that it had been four hours since they had gotten home, she chalked that up to biological clocks or something of that sort. What she did know is that she wanted to get everything now and he was still sleeping, she reached up and poked him, then gently caressed his cheek a few times, when none of this worked she slapped him and he woke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yawn....&quot; Kyle drowsily went to rub his eyes and started to panic, &quot;Why can&#39;t I move???&quot; Jen sat up and Kyle looked at his new massive bust. &quot;Oh.... uh... right. Hi Jen, um... about... um...&quot; Jen lifted her hands up so he could see them and did something he didn&#39;t expect, she signed. &quot;Well, I would be mad, but your my passenger now...&quot; Kyle gulped &quot;...so we won&#39;t be playing like that a lot, but I let you have some fun if you ask nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can sign? I didn&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a lot you don&#39;t know about me, but you&#39;ll learn all about your new mistress as time goes by. Now, we need to shower and get dressed, your a woman now, you have needs and I know what they are, we&#39;re going shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, you... can&#39;t we....&quot; Jen got up and started walking, against Kyle&#39;s protests, he realized he had no choice so he piped down, they walked back to the master bathroom and she stopped to see her new form, she turned, forcing Kyle&#39;s head to turn with her neck and looked at their ass and backside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice ass.&quot; Kyle said, he blushed &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need, we have a nice ass, and your head, even if your a guy, doesn&#39;t look too out of place, like a butch lesbian, if I grow your hair out no one would ever know the difference, you have my voice after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle sighed at that thought as she walked into the shower, grabbing a towel and wash cloth, and turning on the shower, they got in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! That&#39;s too hot!&quot; Jen didn&#39;t listen, she always liked a hot shower, she began washing their body, and reveled in feeling Kyle get a little horny as she rubbed and massaged their body, she got up to the neck and gently took the wash cloth and brought it to Kyle&#39;s face, he closed his eyes and she scrubbed his face like he had never been cleaned before. Kyle suffered under the stinging heat of the shower, trying to to let on that it hurt a bit, she scrubbed his hair deeply, massaging his scalp, all of this touching had him wanting to masturbate again, but Jen wasn&#39;t giving him that. They finished their shower and she grabbed the towel, drying off their body, then putting the towel over Kyle&#39;s head and scrubbing his hair dry. She walked them out in front of the mirror again signed.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, nice and clean, and looking sexy like we should.&quot; Kyle didn&#39;t say anything, still blushing from the experience of having his first shower as a woman. Jen walked them over to the master bedroom&#39;s closet and opened it. To Kyle&#39;s surprise all of his attire had been changed to women&#39;s clothing, still all black and punk, but fitting for their current form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gothy, huh? Well I can rock all black and still look good.&quot; Jen signed, she got out the underwear and started putting on the bra, she stopped before clasping the bra. &quot;We women wear these so these...&quot; She pointed to their breasts &quot;....don&#39;t go bouncing all over the place and get uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right..&quot; <br />
<br />
She finished getting them dressed and walked in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;We look really sexy Kyle. I think I&#39;m going to like having you.&quot; Jen signed, Kyle blushed &quot;Oh don&#39;t be so shy, I am your body after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I can&#39;t control.&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, &quot;Yes, but I&#39;m going to give you what you deserve. I&#39;m going to pamper the hell out of you, since you are technically me, but I&#39;m not going to change too much about us. If you wanna be goth, be goth, but I get to choose the attire, so no latex, I hate latex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. I&#39;m allergic to latex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then we&#39;ll have to do leather then.&quot; Kyle blushed at the thought of wearing a corset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... we need to go out and get some things, then we&#39;ll get something good to eat and hang out. I know this really good sub shop you&#39;d like, and we&#39;ll watch whatever you want okay? Just let me take care of us from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle let her take the lead, the thoughts in the back of his head dreading being controlled by this woman for the rest of his existence, he would have to figure out a way they could change back, since the town curse had to be spoken and not signed. Jen grabbed the wallet on the table as they walked through the house, putting it in her back pocket and slapping their ass, Kyle blushed, not liking it too much, all of this new flesh bouncing and wobbling was driving him crazy, Jen made her way out the door and into the world.</p>
