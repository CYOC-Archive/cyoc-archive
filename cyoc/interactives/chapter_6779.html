<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Graham Millian climbed through the hole in the chain link fence and moving slowly and quietly he put the precision cut piece back into place and tied it securely. He then started down through the piles of dumped stuff. He’d picked out this yard months ago after he’d seen the owner deposit a huge pile of cash (nearly 10k!) in the bank; tracking him back here had been a doodle and the observations he’d made suggested this job should be an easy heist. Get in, get some cash from the office or house and get out. Simple. <br />
<br />
The dogs patrolled in a loose pack, no guard with them. Graham had simply picked a night when the smells from the chemical plant up river were strong, and then had entered the yard via a route which buried his scent under the potent smell of old cooking oils. The route he had was picked out from his many wanderings through the piles during business hours; it would take him direct to the House and then onward to the Office. Graham was convinced that the owner would have the cash in the solid brick house rather than the slightly flimsy steel and wood office. <br />
<br />
Graham quickly made his way to the back wall of the house. From the noise he could hear someone was just leaving via the main gate and Graham waited for the noise of a car starting before moving for the back door. The house lights were off, there was no alarm, and a 5 yr old with 2 fingers missing could pick the back door lock. Graham was in. <br />
<br />
The kitchen was basic and looked seriously out of date, for someone with that much cash Graham had expected better. He moved quickly to the corridor and did a quick check of the bathroom, dining room and lounge. It was all trash, the VCR was 5 yrs old, and there was no DVD or even a Crystal ball. No computer or mobiles lying around either. The cupboards were full of crap; paperwork, old TV magazines, some photo albums, nothing worth shit. There was a beautiful Grizzly Bear statue on the mantelpiece but it would be too hard to flog. Graham spent 5 minutes at the bottom of the stairs listening for snoring or a creaking bed before going up- he’d check the cellar last.  <br />
<br />
Hank waited until he could see the Intruder with his crystal Bear eyes. The man was 6’ 3” with a trim athletic build, wide shoulders, and a nice bearded face, spoilt only by the nasty scar down one cheek, a wound consistent with a knifing. His hair was hidden under a hat, and he was wearing a pair of goggles that stopped Hank getting a look at his eyes. From his dark cameo attrite and his sharp, quick, but silent movements it was obvious he’d done this before. He carried two good sized canvas bags. Hank observed him wandering about, until he actually tried to steal something Hank would do nothing, no point appearing and scaring the bugger if he was leaving empty handed. <br />
<br />
Graham thanked his fixer the 1500th time for the night vision goggles he’d got him. A minor artefact they were no bigger than ski goggles and worked better than the militaries ones, he could see as if under the light levels from a full moon and stars but in colour. He slowly ascended the stairs and stood listening at the top. Since there was no sound he picked the door he thought most likely to be a master bedroom….. And he was right on the money. He took in the Bear paw cap and the ‘US Bears’ magazine and grinned to himself. <br />
“Looks like we got a Papa Bear here” he mummered to himself, taking in the large sized clothes and solid bed. He picked up the latest issue of ‘US Bears’ and flicked through, he’d not been able to get it this month, no store sold it in a place he could nick it from easily. The photos began to turn him on and he adjusted his cock through his clothes; the man on page 32 got him half hard on his own, wow and woof! Graham had always wanted to be a big, burly Bear; he’d even put time in at the gym, but to no avail, he was the classic ectomorph- thin and hard to put muscle onto. Even his stints in prison where he’d had nothing to do but work out had mealy given him muscle tone and the six pack from God.<br />
<br />
Graham rubbed himself hard as he imagined himself with the big Nordic love god on the magazines pages. Suddenly he sensed something……but there was nothing and nobody there. He put the magazine back, after all this was a job, not a pleasure visit. His cock was still hard as he began to turn out the drawers and open up the cupboards. He found big Bear sized clothes, underwear, socks, and some loose change. His erection surged back into life after the found the pipe collection, and he felt harder than any other time recently, he rubbed it even as he tipped another drawer on the floor. <br />
<br />
Breakthrough! The last drawer contained a 1940’s Rolex, which was worth a fortune. He also found some 1940 French cash and some ‘Nam dog tags. He pocketed the cash and watch, but left the tags, he had some lines he would not cross. Graham looted the drawers under the bed with turned up 2k in cash and stock bonds. He then headed for another room.<br />
<br />
Hank flew through the ceiling in his spirit form. The intruder was in his room. Hank was fuming, the way the bastard had handled his Fathers old things got him mad, and there was no way the thief was leaving the house with his Pa’s watch. If he’d taken Joe’s tags, the thief would have been bloody bits already. As the man moved into the bathroom Hank calmed himself……no point rushing in like a Bull in a china shop, the man was taking his time, there was no rush. <br />
<br />
Something about the bathroom jarred in Graham’s mind, he couldn’t place it at first, the oversized shower was interesting and the earth toned tiling nice, but that was not it, there was a smell….something he couldn’t place…….a curious thing caught his eyes- sticking out of the bin where some ripped clothes; jeans and a work shirt. Graham pulled them out, there were big certainly but too small compared to the others he’d seen. Something compelled him to sniff them. He knew that scent! He’d smelt it every night, in the bars downtown! The smell of a Bear shot straight to his cock; he drank deeply until his cock tented the front of his camo’s painfully. <br />
<br />
Hank watched him; he could feel the excitement coming from him. Those clothes defiantly got him turned on. Hank smiled to himself and rubbed his invisible hand up and down the obvious shaft. The young man purred in pleasure, then Hank stopped and grinned, oh yes he had a plan. Rob us would you? <br />
<br />
Graham felt pleasure shoot through him. Every smell of every Bear he’d got laid by rushed though him and made his cock jerk. He could feel his first and still best, Joey as he rubbed his cock that first time. Oh yeah………<br />
<br />
Reality suddenly hit Graham as his watch vibrated on his arm. It was his 10 minute warning. While he was sure the owner was out, he was still tracking the time he spent, after all if he’d only gone for a six pack he could be in real trouble. Reluctantly Graham threw the clothes from him and ransacked the bathroom, as expected nothing worth taking. The next door up here was the spare room, musty and obvious not used he turned it over anyway and found a very old collection of straight porn under the mattress. In one cupboard he found some comics from the 50’s which he took along with some old vinyl singles, never knew what will sell, especially to the collectors market- though he ignored the Monopoly set and such, they were too bulky. In the desk was a plain engagement ring still in its box; that went into his bag. Not bad so far he thought. <br />
<br />
There was nothing in the boiler cupboard apart from towels and dying clothes. Then Graham opened the last door, and nearly came. It was a play room! There was no mistaking it, from the size of the bed to the silk ties. There was a bottle of lube on the dresser and the half open wardrobe door revealed a collection of costumes; construction worker, cowboy, biker. Graham wished he’d got to know the owner rather than try and rob him. From the state of the bed sheets and the smell the room had been used recently as well. His dick was become more and more painfully hard as he walked into the room, imagining himself being fucked on that bed by a huge burly Bear. He adjusted himself again and again, but each contact mealy got him hornier. He tried to concentrate on business and began to turn out the drawers. <br />
<br />
With each drawer he opened Hank ramped up the thief’s excitement. It had been simple to touch the man’s mental pleasure and pain sectors, and it required no special magic to get this one flying. Hank had a most delicious punishment in mind for his one, something Richards’s father had told him once, and old tribal punishment.<br />
<br />
Graham had to pop open the top button of his fly as he began to pull masks and leather goods from the drawers. He’d never been so turned on. Maybe it was the secret trill of finding someone else’s play toys; maybe he’d just not been laid in a long time. Then he found the jockstraps, he couldn’t stop himself taking a sniff. Precum began to bubble out of his cock staining his briefs. Graham wondered what it would be like to have a package big enough to fill the cup of his thing. As he pulled out more and more of them, the second button of his fly popped on its own, his cock making a huge wet tent of his briefs. <br />
<br />
Hank began to stimulate his burglar more; he made the man’s skin feel tingly under his clothes, esp. round his nipples and balls. From the data he was receiving from the man’s mind he was quite hairy in places so he made all the hairs stand up too. He was rewarded by an orgasm so strong the man fell backward onto the bed. <br />
<br />
He’d pulled out the last drawer and found that dildo; he’d picked it up and felt the warmth of the skin. A huge shock and shudder had racked over Graham and he felt himself come, hard. He’d fallen backward and landed on the bed, the huge dildo slapping onto his chest. His breathing was ragged and he lay there for a few seconds panting. <br />
“Oh, fuck, wow….shit…man” he said out loud. He pulled off his goggles and rubbed his eyes. That had been intense; then he realised he was still hard, and horny. He looked down at his crotch- his cock had ripped its way through the soaking fabric of his briefs and was still standing to attention; still dripping cum. Graham was shocked, that had never happened before. He put out a hand to pull himself upright and put his hand into something wet and warm. Jerking his hand back he saw liquid dripping from his fingers, the pungent smell of cum filled his nostrils. He licked his fingers. <br />
<br />
Now Hank was surprised. He had been prompting, but even so. He pushed the pleasure centres a bit more just to see what the man would do. <br />
<br />
Graham cleaned his fingers off then stopped, why had he done that? He normally didn’t go for cum drinking unless it was fresh. He’d always fantasized about drinking his own, but even with his dexterity he had never been able to bend that far. He looked at his straining cock, bigger than he ever remembered it before…….a dangerous thought entered his head. Why not now? There was none around to witness it and he’d need to strip out of these soaking briefs, plenty here to change into too………even before he’d finished the thought he was taking off his tight polo-neck and undoing his belt. Quickly he was nude, it felt good to let his dick wave free. He ran a hand over his brick like six pack, and through the hair on his pecs, teasing his nipples. He sat back down, the dildo flop-rolled into his hand. Oh yeah……..<br />
<br />
Hank slipped inside the man’s mind, it was not procession because he was not taking control, he mealy wanted to experience what was to come though someone else’s skin. It had been nearly ten years since he got laid, and he’d been alive for some of that. Graham offered no resistance to Hank and quickly the spirit had found his hosts fantasies, wishes, and desires; he ‘read’ them and fed them to his host’s conscious mind, oh yes we were going to play out some of these. <br />
<br />
Sticking his fingers into the pot of lube Graham ran his slick fingers up and down his hard shaft with one hand while he played his nipples with the other. His cock swelled with his touch, easily reaching his navel, he felt it grow under his fingers, becoming longer and thicker. He didn’t question why, he simply went with it. He swapped hands on his cock and got fresh lube on his fingers. He spread his legs and began to slips his fingers inside himself, first his index, then as he opened up his middle. He always wanted to do this, most of the Bears he’d met only ever wanted him to suck them off, he was too much of a ‘twink’ to deserve a fucking or to give one.<br />
<br />
He had three fingers inside and the pot had moved to where he could dip his other fingers in and feed more into his hole. He felt fantastic, energised and flying more than ever. With his other hand he dipped the dildo into the lube pot and then withdrew his hand, quickly he pushed the massive head into the outer part of his ass. Slowly he pushed it inside- he was gasping for air and stopped several times, this was bigger than anyone he’d ever had. Then his ass muscles began to cramp and pull the rubber intruder inside, he couldn’t stop himself, inch after inch was sucked in, pleasure and pain washed over him in equal measures, his thick cock dribbled onto his abs, sweat began to pour off him onto the soiled sheets. Then it stopped. The dildo was buried up to its fake balls in his butt; he could feel all 14” of it deep within his gut. He was breathing deep. Graham looked down at himself, his cock was ram rod hard and pointing at him, the head at the top of his abs, close. He began to worm his way up the bed, the dildo sending ecstatic signals up his spine as he moved backwards. <br />
<br />
Reaching the head board Graham spun himself round and began to push his feet up the wall, each movement driving the dildo deeper. As he crunched himself upward his cock head came closer and closer towards his trusting forward mouth. He stretched his neck to the limits but his cock head remained out of reach. Graham grabbed his cock and tried to pull it towards him, it jumped in his hand and grew longer. He pulled at himself with both hands to make it grow more. It thickened and lengthened the cock head coming closer and closer, he pushed himself up the wall only to slide down on the slick sheets, the motion pistoning the dildo in and out of his ass. He got a rhythm going, up and down the wall he slid, his hand matching his motion on his growing cock. Then he got it, he licked that thick purple head with his tongue, then it was inside his own mouth. Slurping and thrusting he pushed himself harder and harder fucking himself on both ends.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for him to come. The explosion shot from his balls and up his shaft and filled his mouth and throat like nothing he’d ever experienced. He blew a huge load, sliding down the bed as he filled himself. His body flopped with the pleasure as his load filled him. Slowly the flow stopped and Graham lay panting on the wet bed. His massive cock softened slightly and lay sat on his chest, still dribbling the last bits of his cum. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah! Hank thought. Wow! He’d forgotten how intense a solid’s orgasm was. <br />
Even riding shotgun his man knew how to blow a load! But Hank was not finished with him. He was going to make sure the beast could never commit a burglary again, and he was going to enjoy doing it. It would be simple magic. The irony was the design came from within Grahams own mind. <br />
<br />
The afterglow did not last long. Graham pushed himself up on his elbows and looked at the semi-spent dick lying on his chest. He couldn’t understand why it was still massive. Just looking at it turned him on and it began to stir again, lifting itself from the goo on his chest and pointing itself right at his mouth. He didn’t need the wall to reach it now it grew upwards and into his wanting mouth as if it was meant to be there. He pushed his arms upright and began to thrust with his hips. Pleasure washed over him and his body jerked. He flexed and unflex his muscles as the worked the cock in and out of his mouth, his spread legs providing the lift, his ass the thrill from the dildo. His balls swelled and kept swelling as they filled with seed. Graham clenched and unclenched his fists grabbing and dropping the sheets below him, he didn’t notice his fingernails getting longer, ripping the fabric. <br />
<br />
Graham thrust and thrust getting himself more worked up and pumped up, his arms becoming defined and larger, his shoulders and neck widening like a bulls. His thighs grew thicker and stronger, his longer feet taking up more room on the sheets, his toenails ripping their own furrow. Ecstasy filled Graham he was unaware of what was going on to his body, all he could feel was pleasure, pure pleasure. His expanding chest, lats, and eight pack were was far from his mind as the growing covering of thick hair on his back, arms, chest and legs. If he was capable the fact his head hair now flowed down his back like a mane would be worrisome now it didn’t matter, nothing mattered, nothing at all.</p>
