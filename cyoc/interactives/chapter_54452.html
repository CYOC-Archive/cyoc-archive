<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing in the corral, Jerome saw his or her future as if she were doomed by fate to face life with someone as perverse a person as was he when still human.<br />
<br />
In his memory he knew the delight he felt when having rouge sex with a mare. Unknown then and still, but as what happened, he felt sure the mare knew more of how to make a man change form than might a true born mare. The memory of that last great time of sexual pleasure stood vivid still in his mind. The sensations as the mare with her strong vulva lips held him so tightly he she took him off the bucket he stood upon and holding him by his engorged cock she walked feeling him empaled in her vagina.<br />
<br />
The thought back to how he had used the male enhancement pills he had taken for the previous six months did more than he expected. Jerome saw his penis grow in size to become a cock almost equal to that of the stallion pony King Largo. Grown in length to sixteen inches when in full erect state, as from base to the blunt end, Jerome felt pure pleasure as he had made use of his enhanced tool to hump horse mares and/or especially loved were pony mares.<br />
<br />
Moaning together from the sensations, he remembered the night well when he then felt the tight hold on his cock loosen. He having then in slow motion slipped down from out and off the hairy rump of that wondrous young mare, fell then to the ground with a bear butt. <br />
<br />
The changed man then a mare did wander in circles while shaking its head in thoughts of what might well have been a sense of personal disgust of Jerome; as someone of youth and thought of then as being still pure and untainted by life. That mare watched as Jerome got on his clothes with plans to leave, saw as he was gathering his strewn cowboy boots from the corners of her stall.<br />
<br />
Flaccid with his aroused cock hanging out the slitted opening of his jockey underpants, the length of it while in this state an impossibility to put comfortably back in where a human penis would remain most of any a day. As that mare stood by watching him, he remembered then urge to pee and stood then as might a true stallion with legs stretched apart and did piss then in that stall.<br />
<br />
Whatever, if but the minutes of extreme excitement brought on that personal need, the contentment felt made Jerome complacent. He returned to his walking in the stall, oblivious to the possible dangers as he went to pickup his favorite footwear, he remembered how he let out a yowl.<br />
<br />
He saw a red stain began to show in his white cotton sock. Another yowl came as Jerome pulled from the sole of his foot a sharp piece of straw-bale binding wire, it part of the floor covering. Minutes of pressure put on the bleeding wound had the blood loss almost stopped. Being tough, with a grunt and grown he put on his cowboy boot over the sore foot and into place, ready to walk away. It quite sore made him limp. Jerome walked past the horny mare he had mated, him smoothing his hand down the withers, over her back and round lovely rump.<br />
<br />
Standing on his good foot Jerome fumbled with the latch to the stall door. Suddenly he felt a warmth and the a hot wet feeling as if his boot and sore foot were again bleeding. He then turning saw a bright greenish stream of mare urine shooting from straddled wide legs and pouring down inside the boot.<br />
<br />
Horrified by the sight, feel, and knowledge that the urine could case him a massive infection, he quickly walked out of the stall and with a slushy sensation in his boot.<br />
<br />
Unrealized then but something more happened to him then he knew was possible. His foot as injured did not get infected, but changed, becoming as the hind hoof and foot of an equine animal. In the days that followed his human body contorted harshly, painfully, until he in horror and horny, began walking the earth as a equine animal too, but discovering soon on that he had become a she, a mare!<br />
<br />
What was, was beginning again, but to Jerome as if a sentencing of him to live as a mare and how he had come to do to mares. The man who owned him then did use the mare form to satisfy his carnal lusts. He for some reason felt no draw to love a woman, but found his theme to life when humped over the hairy rump of a mare.<br />
<br />
Jerome had kept her body free from stallions mating her, but felt a sense of mutual delight when Dan came to her and did intrigue her with sensual sensations only a female would relish and as a mare would stand and accept as if proper. Meeting life head-on in a pony mare form, Jerome remembered his lost humanity and that lovely long cock he so enjoyed, but considering the ease of how she lived and was loved, he as a mare felt still as if being what he was when human, a &quot;Zoo!&quot;</p>
