<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff headed back to his room and opened up the Chronivac. Game day was usually his least favorite day of the week. Dave tended to be pretty cool, but his son had always been a bit of an asshole. Sure, in this reality that wasn&#39;t true. There was no way in hell Finn would ever mess with a guy like Jeff now. The head difference in height and what had to be at least 100+ pounds meant that Finn could not easily bully Jeff into doing what he wanted. Of course, that didn&#39;t mean Jeff didn&#39;t remember the way Finn treated him when he was smaller either. <br />
<br />
He pulled up Finn&#39;s profile to see everything there, followed by &#39;what would you like to change?&#39; beneath all the stats. &quot;First things first,&quot; Jeff changed the target&#39;s awareness to off. He didn&#39;t want Finn to realize what was happening. Then he switched Finn&#39;s sexuality to closeted gay. The loading bar whirled up in front of him and then disappeared. &quot;Ready already?&quot; Then figured to add another change, &#39;he instantly gets an erection when he sees me.&#39; Again, the loading bar appeared then disappeared in what seemed like an instant.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to give it a try and head back downstairs. &quot;How&#39;s the game?&quot; he asked, making sure to keep an eye on Finn. The jock&#39;s shorts went tight and a clear bulge started to form as Finn&#39;s eyes ran up and down the massive muscular tiger&#39;s body. He seemed to trace the roundness of his biceps and focus deeply on Finn&#39;s heavy chest. Jeff gave him a bit of a flex, watching the other man&#39;s eyes nearly bulge. But Finn quickly took to readjusting his posture and trying to hide his hard dick. It wasn&#39;t very successful. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good,&quot; Dave was the first to say. &quot;You&#39;re missing a blowout. Those fucking cheese heads are going to be pissed tonight if our boys keep it up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear man,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m missing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stay,&quot; Dave looked over the couch at him. &quot;I&#39;m sure your homework can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff watch Finn out of the corner of his eye. He could almost see the guy nodding along. &quot;Don&#39;t know if I can... I&#39;ll try to hurry up and catch the end of it.&quot; Finn&#39;s face soured at the comment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck,&quot; Dave added.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to the kitchen. Each step he could feel Finn&#39;s eyes planted on his ass. Jeff even took it upon himself to show off even more. Purposefully tightening his glutes so the two butt cheeks and swishing his tail back and forth to really get his eyes moving. The moment Jeff turned around he saw Finn&#39;s eyes go back to his phone as his cheeks turned bright red. A hand pushed at his dick, trying his best to hide it. <br />
<br />
&#39;Perfect,&#39; Jeff smiled to himself as he went back up to his room. He sat back down at his computer and went through Finn&#39;s profile again. He quickly added that Finn is a smart anthropomorphic red fox. All of Finn&#39;s stats started to change.<br />
<br />
      Height - 6&#39;3&quot; -> 5&#39;2&quot;<br />
      Weight - 170 pounds -> 83 pounds<br />
<br />
Other aspects about him had shifted as well showing that he was quite a bit smarter than he had been. Most surprising was his degree to computer programming. A bit of a devious smile filled his face as he remembered that&#39;s what he was in college for. Even if Finn would have been smart enough to take those classes, there was clearly an ulterior motive to the reason he was in them. Just to make sure, Jeff added a bit of an infatuation of him in too. He clicked enter and watched the bar appear. Then sighed as he realized how long it&#39;d probably take.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up, stretching to the ceiling. &quot;Might as well take a break,&quot; he smiled to himself as he headed back to the living room. As his first foot hit the step, Finn was already looking up at him. The guy quickly buried his face back into his phone, doing anything to think about anything other than the massive white tiger walking down the stairs. His legs shifted back and forth as though he was almost pleasuring himself. All the while his tail swung with great intention back and forth. Finn&#39;s eyes followed perfectly. Jeff&#39;s smile only widened. &quot;How&#39;s the game going?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Still good,&quot; Dave smiled. &quot;Missed a couple of touchdowns, but there&#39;s almost no way they&#39;re going to make a comeback.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now it&#39;s no fun if they don&#39;t even make a touchdown,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Where&#39;s the tension?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can still feel some...&quot; Dave looked over his shoulder up at Jeff. Finn dug himself deeper into the couch. Jeff wondered if his personality was changing first. Maybe that was the easiest because he technically already had an interest, now it was more of an infatuation. Just his presence seemed to make the guy want to shrink into almost nothing. But that seemed to be happening already. His well built frame was starting to lose some of its muscle. His thick biceps had thinned out and shoulders receded. Even funnier was watching the large jersey he was wearing start to turn into just a blue t-shirt with a Ram&#39;s logo on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Jeff pretended not to notice as he plopped down next to Finn on the couch. Finn&#39;s dark brown hair was already starting to turn a bit red while patches of red fur appeared on his arms and white fur on his hands. Little black claws had started to extend from his fingers where his nails had been. &quot;Do you feel any tension?&quot; Jeff directed the question at Finn.<br />
<br />
The shrinking man squirmed even harder. He&#39;d already lost 3 inches and it was soon to be 4. There was nearly a foot difference between the two now and he could barely help himself with Jeff being so close. It didn&#39;t help that Jeff was purposefully taunting him by flexing his arm. The muscle bulged with power and a vein slowly emerged from the white and black fur. &quot;N-N-N-O!&quot; Finn stammered out a squeak. He felt his face burn red. But that might have been the muzzle slowly extending out from his face. The tip of his nose had turned pitch black and lifted up as his skull reshaped into a muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Jeff shot a smirk at Dave. &quot;Because I don&#39;t feel any tension either. I actually came down here to ask for some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help?&quot; Finn&#39;s eyes went wide. His ears twitched as they moved to the top of his head and turned into bright orange triangles with long white fur covering them up. &quot;What kind of help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Programming silly,&quot; Jeff said. <br />
<br />
Even with the red fur, Jeff could see Finn&#39;s face burn red. &quot;Rea-really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Jeff got up close and personal with the changing fox. His hand rested on Finn&#39;s leg and gently rubbed it. It was less than half the size it had been even just minutes ago. His entire body had dwindled away to nearly nothing as his body carried almost no muscle or fat. &quot;Why don&#39;t you come to my room and help me out?&quot; That&#39;s when he stood up and held out his hand. Finn cautiously took it as he stood as well. It took a bit of a hop to get off the couch as his legs no longer touched. As his paws touched the floor, a bright orange tail with a white tip erupted from his behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay,&quot; Finn nodded. He didn&#39;t let go of the tiger&#39;s paw. Nor did he notice his own paw pads starting to grow the palms of his hands. <br />
<br />
As Jeff stepped on the first step, Dave looked over his shoulder again. &quot;Don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t do,&quot; though he had a joking smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure homework&#39;s mandatory,&quot; Jeff shot back. A deep roll of laughter erupted from Dave as he went back to the game. Jeff continued up the staircase, leading Finn into his room. He closed the door behind him, garnering a heavy gulp from the fox. Finn looked up at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What--What did you need help with?&quot; Finn asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;This,&quot; Jeff said. He dropped his shorts and jock around his paws and stepped forward. His cock rose to attention. The eleven-inch rod pointed almost directly at Finn&#39;s face. The little fox had no idea what to do. It was like his entire life just froze as he looked at the large cock in front of him. Jeff forced down his laugh. He didn&#39;t realize he&#39;d short circuit the other man. &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; he smiled as he got down on Finn&#39;s level. &quot;I&#39;m not going to hurt you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Finn nodded. Words still seemed to be failing him. Especially as Jeff&#39;s big hand pet the soft fur on his head. A smile was drifting onto the fox&#39;s face as he felt the hand run down the side of his body and drop his shorts as well. His cock also stood at attention, though it wasn&#39;t nearly as impressive as Jeff&#39;s. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, lookie here big guy,&quot; Jeff joked. His finger and thumb gently rubbed the 4-inch cock. It throbbed under the light pressure. Finn&#39;s small body lurched into Jeff&#39;s body and squeezed his massive bicep. He let out a grunt as his claws dug through Jeff&#39;s fur. His body thrust a couple of times. &quot;You like that?&quot; Jeff asked. All he got was a weak nod, but the mess that had shot out of Finn&#39;s cock into his hand was enough to let him know that Finn thought he was sexy. He laughed at the thought. Then nuzzled his muzzle against Finn&#39;s. &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn looked up as Jeff rose back to his full height. Jeff&#39;s cock throbbed with excitement just a bit below Finn&#39;s face. His small hands cautiously reached out and started rubbing. The tiny fox needed both and even then there was still almost too much meat to work with. His hands slide up and down the fat cock. Jeff&#39;s deep guttural moans only encouraged him. Especially when his cum covered hand landed on Finn&#39;s head and rubbed it gently. &quot;That&#39;s it. More of that,&quot; Jeff told him. <br />
<br />
With another nod, Finn continued. He worked his meticulous fingers up and down the shaft and slid underneath Jeff&#39;s mighty balls. They retracted slightly, only to shoot forward coating the red fur in something white and sticky. &quot;Oh shit...&quot; Jeff cursed. He leaned down and lifted Finn up, tossing the fox onto the bed. He pulled the stained shirt off his body and slid his tongue over Finn&#39;s bright orange fur. That tongue ran up his chest and slipped into Finn&#39;s mouth. The two kissed, enjoying the mild afterglow of the situation. They laid there in Jeff&#39;s bed, snuggling against each other. &quot;I think you&#39;d better get cleaned up...&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn buried his head deeper into Jeff&#39;s meaty chest. &quot;Fine...&quot; Jeff conceded. &quot;Just a few more minutes...&quot;</p>
