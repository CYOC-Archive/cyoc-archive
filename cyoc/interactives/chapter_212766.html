<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;damn speakers on the fritz again!&quot; Liam Cockney yelled as he tried to fix the gym&#39;s speaker system again. he had been working here for 3 years and always seemed to have to fix the same speakers. the 48-year-old maintenance tech was at his breaking point with this school, if it wasn&#39;t the speaker system it was the computer lab because some idiot used it to download pirated movies. he was actually glad the board was going to shut this place down then he&#39;ll be able to get a job at a tech company or something. he was busy fixing the faulty wiring when he heard the janitor bob something, speaking behind him &quot;hey Liam how&#39;s it going&quot; he said as he began pulling something from behind his back. <br />
<br />
&quot;just peachy, these stupid wires keep shorting out and I have to be the one to fix them,&quot; he said with his back to the janitor &quot;*sigh* I just wish this could be simpler,&quot; he said putting a hand to the bridge of his nose, his glasses slid up slightly as he did so. &quot;well if that&#39;s the case I&#39;ve got something. just understand it&#39;s for your own good,&quot; he said before putting something on his head. &quot;bob what the he...&quot; he said before seeing a 7-foot toon ant behind him wearing a janitor outfit. &quot;like I said this is for the greater good,&quot; he said before crossing both sets of arms over his chest. &quot;what are you some kind of freak and what&#39;d you do to bob?&quot; Liam asked as the metal helmet merged with his head. &quot;first off i&#39;m a toon and second of all I was bob though now you can call me scout,&quot; Scout said while listing the answers with his upper right hand. &quot;and third of all I needed to toon you so your personality would be mostly unchanged&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;what the f___ does that mean, what the h___ what&#39;s happening to my f______ voice,&quot; he said or tried to. &quot;trust me I tried to once my changes finished, you&#39;ll just make a lot of squeaking when you try to c*squeak* see.&quot; scout said as Liam&#39;s ears turned a shiny white metal and moved up his head before turning to metallic horns with a black underside, his ear holes stayed in place before turning into small microphone capable of hearing the tiniest of noses. &quot;from what I&#39;ve seen from myself and Willy the grounds keeper the changes should help your genitals intact but bigger. so I&#39;m gonna head out of here for a few and come back when you&#39;re done,&quot; Scout said as he left the gym. Liam could not believe this he tried to leave but before he could even stand up everything went black.  <br />
<br />
this is because his mind was being turned into a supercomputer, quickly linking every change to it. Liam&#39;s frozen expression changes t a neutral one as a large black screen appeared where his eyes once were. his face pushed out into a metallic muzzle as his nose sunk into it before his nostrils became a filtration system to keep his new &#39;brain&#39; from overheating. his teeth vanished except for 4, 2 on the top front of his mouth and two on the top back of his mouth, these merged with the white metal covering his mouth. the next changes were internal, his mouth was altered. the flesh became black rubber as his tongue turned orange. his vocal cords became a voice box and his throat became simply a tube, his lungs disappeared as they no longer needed to exist. his stomach became a high-tech machine capable of turning anything that went inside it into energy for him. his intestines also became nothing more than a way to expel excess energy in a toxic cloud (farts). <br />
<br />
his neck elongated as his skin turned to several individual metal segments, white on the back and black on the front. his shoulders turned white with a line horizontally down the center, and a black rubber padding grew around the metal plate. his once fat torso thinning considerably as the metal completely covered it and split into certain segments so he could move, his front gained black while his back gained white. his arms slimming down as they became covered in the same metal, his elbows becoming a metal plate similar to his shoulders, with a rubber covering running along the connection. his hands becoming robotic before the familiar 3-fingered gloves on them, the tools in his hands seemed to absorb into his body. a long segmented tail grew from above his ass, not stopping till it was a foot longer than his legs.  <br />
<br />
the most interesting thing was his genitals didn&#39;t grow instead they shrank till there was just a blank black plate in its place. his legs slowly turned metallic as his height changed to 8 and a half feet. his knees like his other joints became a separate plate with black rubber surrounding the joint. his ankles raised as his feet lost 3 toes the remaining two grew making it look like a computer mouse. L.I.A.M.&#39;s final change happened when several wires poked out of his body and proceeded to absorb his entire toolbox. &quot;Operating system fully established. checking systems... visual screen interface operational. filtration system operational. audio receptors operational. voice box operational. taste receptors operational. fuel conversion systems operational. servomotors operational. unknown gloves detected on hands... pose no threat to core systems. mental adjustment finalized. accessing personality L.I.A.M., Life. Interactive. Assisting. Machine. <br />
<br />
2  yellow eyes appeared on his face screen with slits as dark as the screen. &quot;OK that was something&quot;  the robo-drake toon said rising to his full height. his voice now had a cool robotic sound to it, his clothes long since vanished. &quot;what the F*static* H*static* happened to my cock? right the censoring surprised my genitals didn&#39;t make the cut.&quot; he took stock of his new toon self, by that he was actually able to see a 3-D display in his vision that showed his body and all its functions. &#39;OK so I&#39;m a robotic dragon toon now. really, my name is an acronym now?&#39;. he saw that he also had lights on his shoulder, tail, horns, and the center of his chest. once he was done he looked down at the broken speaker, he scanned it, and found the exact wire that was faulty. several retractable arms popped out of his back with different uses, these ranged from wire cutters to simply a grab claw. in less than 2 seconds he replaced the wire and it now sounded better than ever. <br />
<br />
&quot;D*static*, *sigh* gotta stop that it&#39;s just annoying now. but, that was amazing. guess Scout was right&quot; he said grabbing a chair with a gloved hand, only to pause as he saw to chair grow to his size and gained a cartoon appearance. looking at his gloves &quot;guess that&#39;s how this happened to me. man what I wouldn&#39;t give to have sex with a girl right now.&quot; as he finished speaking a voice called out from his head, &quot;sexual desires detected. designation: MALE. activating reproductive system. system operational&quot; it sounded like his voice but there was no emotion to it. he then felt the plate covering his crotch flip and reveal a 2-foot cock and balls the size of softballs. with a smile he begins jacking off, a climax meter appearing in his vision. he soon cumed over the gym floor before he heard the gym door opening. &quot;additional subject detected. sexual pleasure reducing. reproductive systems deactivating.&quot; the voice said as his crotch flipped back to neural appearance.  <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah sometimes that happens, it&#39;s actually how I got tooned,&quot; Scout said. &quot;sorry just &#39;testing my systems&#39; G*static* that was a bad pun,&quot; Liam said. &quot;no problem, puns are just a toon thing. speaking of I&#39;m gonna &#39;double&#39; time this mess, get it I&#39;ve got double the arms&quot; he joked before pulling a mop from behind him and quickly cleaning the mess. &quot;I do have a question though. are you OK being nude?&quot; he asked Liam. &quot;from what I gather &#39;it&#39; only shows up when I want it to,&quot; Liam replied before leaving for the day.  </p>
