<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad looked down at the black top hat which just fit in the box. He resisted the urge to try it out here and instead placed the closed box back in his locker to collect it later. It wouldn´t really fit in his full bag right now, and it was hours until 4PM anyway.<br />
After his last class of the day at 3PM Chad returned to his locker and switched most of his bags belongings in the locker before placing the box with the hat in the bag. Then he moved to the field house. He would be early, but that would be no problem.<br />
At the field house he quickly stripped out of his clothes, placing them on one of the chairs. His bag laid next, his shoes in front of it. Then he checked the time, it was already nearing 4PM, only ten minutes left. Smiling, he took the top hat out of the box and put it on his head in one swift motion, bowing down in show. The hat stayed on his head, even as it was nearly a ninety degree angle he bowed in.<br />
He was startled as someone clapped from the door behind him, but as he stood back normal to turn around the top hat slipped down his head, encasing him down to his neck, his head completely swallowed. Now the clapping stopped, as it was replaced by laughing in a male voice, as Chad noted. But his reply to the laughing was silenced by the hat.<br />
Then the voice spoke up: “Well Chad, that worked better than I thought it would. But what to expect from a dumb jock like you? At least when we have finished this you will be cleverer and more knowledgeable then now.”<br />
To the outside, Chad made some unintelligent noises. The top hat had shrunken around his head, leaving him unable to do anything but trash around. But that got slower and weaker as Chad lost his control more and more. What he hadn´t know was that the hat hadn´t stopped shrinking as it encased his head, but continued to shrink, deforming his head beside making it smaller as well.<br />
Soon in place of Chad´s head was just a cylindrical form, and if Chad had seen it he wouldn´t know what it was. “You come along nicely, but now let´s see if a brain-dead jock like you is really mostly a big cum factory.” the voice said.<br />
Chad had noticed he was getting rather horny as his cock had grown to his full size, nearing the edge of release. But just before his body could come, another change occurred, leaving him hanging. His cock absorbed his balls before growing bigger, slowly swelling to a new form, more round. Soon it deformed from a near ball like shape as details formed on it. It took only a minute, but in place of Chad´s cock a new head had grown in.<br />
By now Chad had no more control of his body beside his shrunken head, which was still encased and trapped. He could feel the changes happen, but that didn´t help him. All his muscles shifted, as slowly his arms and legs turned into each other, followed by his hands and feet. Then finally his body itself turned around, and to anyone seeing Chad right now they would think he was making a handstand.<br />
The voice laughed at him, as he tipped against Chads chest, which had been his stomach minutes before, and Chad tilted and fell over onto his backside. “Now your new self only needs to wake up, little Chad. I guess you still don´t know your fate. That top hat has turned you around, and your tiny brain is now nothing but your new balls, which are rather small. If your new self was to masturbate we would lose the old you in one little go, but that&#39;s not what will happen. As I want the old you to be around a long time, the new Chad isn´t allowed to use you to cum, cockhead. So the top hat is now a cock cage for you to be hold in forever. Enjoy your new life, cockboy, as your new self will be you from now on.”<br />
Chad cursed that voice, as he felt still rather horny and couldn´t release. Soon the new Chad woke up, and slowly stood up. To the old one it was uncomfortable to hung head-down, but that would be his new normal.<br />
“You okay there, Chad?” asked the voice.<br />
While the old one screamed “No” in his limited mind, his own voice responded from the awoken new Chad: “Ugh, I will be fine Jeremy. But you now to call me by my middle name Johnny, or John, as I hate the name Chad.”<br />
“Oh, sorry John, I havn´t thought about that.” answered the now labeled voice of Jeremy.<br />
Chad was cursing again, Jeremy was one of the nerds he had some fun with on regular basis. And now he had reduced him to a caged cock? And would be called by the middle name he hated? Had Jeremy twisted more than that?<br />
John started to put his clothes back on in silence while Jeremy watched him. Soon John was finished dressing, and looked at Jeremy. “Thanks for freeing me of that dumb idiot down there, Jeremy. So you know, he is cursing you right now.”<br />
Jeremy looked surprised as he answered: “You know and can hear him?”<br />
“Yeah, you have been right about him being a cum factory, I´m much more brains than he was. Therefore I know what you did, and I´m happy with it. And I will try to blend him out if needed. Do you want to do something, my friend?” John replied. <br />
Meanwhile Chad was stunned that John could hear him. “Please, find a way for us to switch back.” <br />
“No, cockboy. I like this already. It´s a pity I need to keep you alive at all, I would much more like it to just shot you out. No be quiet.” John said loud, looking down at his hidden cock. With a bit of concentration, John silenced Chad in his head.<br />
Jeremy laughed: “Is he annoying you now to switch back? Chad, so that you know, there is no way to change you back, it was a one-way ticket for you.”<br />
While Chad cursed more, but was no unheard by John, John himself answered Jeremy: “Yeah, that&#39;s what he wanted. As if I would voluntary switch back to being just a cock. I got more brains then he would ever get, so I can use his old life, my new one, much better than him. Say, Jeremy, is there a way to copy this effect so we could turn the other brain-dead jocks too?”<br />
“It will take some time, but we could do so. What do you think you will do with your new life then, John?” Jeremy asked curious.<br />
“I guess less sports, but more studying. As good as sports are, they don´t help you your whole life. We will see. Are you sure I need to keep him down there?” John answered.<br />
“Oh, you don´t need to keep him, but I want to torture him for being an asshole to everyone who isn´t in sports like him. But I thought you wouldn´t be able to hear him, so if he annoys you to much we can get ride off him.” Jeremy explained.<br />
“Oh yeah, I want him to learn his new place before we send him out, and I have already silenced him, so it´s not a problem to keep him. But good to know we can later. And I can tell you from time to time how cockboy feels, that&#39;s a bonus. What did you do with the key to his cage?”<br />
Jeremy laughed at that. “Yeah, knowing how miserable he is, is a bonus. I have the key at home, as I didn´t thought I would need it anyway. If you want I will give it to you later.”<br />
“Nah, better not. If I have the key myself there is the possibility that if he annoys me I just use it to get ride off him. If you keep it it won´t be a panic reaction that releases him.”<br />
With that both John and Jeremy mounted Chad´s, now John´s bike to drive over to Jeremy´s home.<br />
To Chad this was horror. While he couldn´t control anything of his body, he could use all his senses beside his sight. And Jeremy hugging him from behind felt weird. Being in constant darkness was something he hated as well, but he was sure the only way for him to see again, if at all, was to be freed of the cage, and neither John nor Jeremy planned on that.</p>
