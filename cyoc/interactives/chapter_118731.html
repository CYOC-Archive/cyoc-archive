<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Helen woke up by the sound of her alarm. She quickly reached for it and set herself onto the side of her bed, admiring her new body once again. She still was only in possession of male clothes, so for a woman like she was now, that would probably have become a problem. But with a little change of thoughts, once she opened her wardrobe, &#39;a few of her once male clothes had turned to fit her new posture&#39;. She acted towards her thoughts and indeed, Helen&#39;s wardrobe now had some woman-sized clothes lying in between the sloppy clothes she used to wear.<br />
<br />
It was still searching through a bit, since it had always kind of been a mess in her wardrobe, but nevertheless she was able to find a good selection of clothes to wear for the day. Helen had picked up a white polo shirt, which was identical to the she already had bought, but nevertheless a few sizes smaller so it would fit her much better. In another way however, it fit her too well. She didn&#39;t really want it to express all her curves, but since it wasn&#39;t really natural for a woman to wear a shirt for men, she&#39;d have to go with it. She could still change it with the new option of her Chronivac program, but she left it as it was. If that were the case all women could be wearing sloppy male shirts, and with her still male mind, that would ruin the thought. Besides, the polo showing her curves was exciting.<br />
<br />
With that came Helen&#39;s pants. They had decreased a few sizes as well, but it barely looked like it when she held it in front of her. Comparing them next to the pants she wore when she was still a man, Matt was her previous name, the only differences Helen saw were that the &#39;new&#39; pants were shorter to match her height, and that the trousers had shrunk in width on the underside of her pants. For what was left, the top of her pants, where she would put them on first, were as wide as they once were. Soon enough, she already understood why the Chronivac program only changed the height and bottom width. All she had to do, was look behind her, where a round ass was sticking out.<br />
<br />
Helen couldn&#39;t immediately put on those pants. She was still wearing her shorts from sleeping. Pushing them down her legs, she didn&#39;t think too much of it, but then she opened her drawer. Helen expected only to find other shorts of the original male size over there, but virtually hit herself on the head when the first thing she was staring down at, were a bunch of panties on top of each other. Obviously some shorts were still inside the drawer, but almost half of the space was taken up by the female underwear she&#39;d never worn before. It gave her a wicked feeling, as she bit her lips when grabbing one. It was like she had stolen another girl&#39;s panties for her own fun, but then as a man. This &#39;fun&#39; thought, was also quickly taken over her sex, now getting wet. She looked down for a bit, still holding a panty between two fingers, but just tried to ignore it. With the possibilities of the Chronivac, especially with the command that was now running, she could have fun with her new self later. She pushed the feelings of arousal aside and brought the panty to her legs. Pulling the piece of cloth up, she gave a shuddered breath, questioning her lack of courage, and pulled the panty up further, until it made contact with her pussy.<br />
<br />
Helen expected the worst with her negative mindset. As an argument she had that with the Chronivac, anything could happen. Despite all this, the fabric on her nether regions felt surprisingly nice and comfortable! When looking at the panties of a woman, she previously always thought that a male member would be painfully cramped up over there. She hadn&#39;t proven this way, but that was still what she&#39;d to feel, not really having had the realization yet that she&#39;d turned into a girl. The fabric was still a bit cool, so it gave her mild chills at first. Walking around through the room with a woman&#39;s panty around her sex was satisfying nevertheless, and it turned out to be much more pleasant than she previously had in mind.<br />
<br />
After all this exploring, Helen put on the clothes she&#39;d already parted from the rest. The only thing missing was a bra. She wasn&#39;t able to find any inside her wardrobe, and concluded that no men&#39;s clothes were exactly comparable to that of a bra. Still, to cover up her nipples, that with any kinky thought or chilly circumstance would get hard, she put on a shirt underneath her polo, which had also been set to the size she was right now as a woman. As Helen got changed, she walked to the bathroom to comb her hair and make a ponytail. All that wasn&#39;t too difficult, but when she saw at least a little makeup could be decent, for sure for a first day in university, she quickly &#39;put on some makeup&#39; using the command on her program.<br />
<br />
In seconds Helen saw the effects in the bathroom mirror. She hadn&#39;t undergone a huge transformation, but this for sure changed something for her appearance. It made her look a bit more mature, and she found herself more attractive like this as well. It confirmed her previous thoughts: if she looked nice, she felt the same way.<br />
<br />
Quickly finishing off her morning routine she always did before going out of the house, she put on her &#39;now smaller shoes&#39;, and stepped out of the house. The door closing behind her, she held her arm in front of her body, gripping her other arm. Looking at her chest, cleavage showing a little bit, she breathed in deeply, and started walking.</p>
