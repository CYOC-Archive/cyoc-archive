<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian smiled as he looked through the options, there were thousands of numbers, and descriptions, so many it was hard to choose! Eventually, the one that caught his eye was scale. Lucy had always controlled him, even though they were about as smart, Lucy was much stronger and used that advantage to push Brian around. He wanted a chance to do the same, the question was, how small. On one hand, he could make her slightly smaller, then beat her at her own game when she tried to use her strength. Brian didn&#39;t just want partial control though, he wanted complete control. He changed the scale setting from 100% to 10% and watched as all the other settings re-arranged. Viewing her basic stats again, he saw that her height was now 6.8 inches, and her weight was 1.2 pounds. Brian clicked the apply button, and got a popup:<br />
<br />
Time until Transformation complete: ___<br />
Duration: ___<br />
<br />
Setting the duration to the end of Sunday, Brian tapped his keyboard in thought. Setting it to 30 minutes, Brian clicked accept, setting his watch to countdown at the same time. A window with a countdown and an image of Lucy popped up and Brian smiled, this really was a nice program. Locking his computer, Brian headed to Lucy&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
***<br />
&quot;Hey Lucy!&quot;, Brian said, pushing his way into the room and surveying his surroundings. Lucy&#39;s room was pretty standard, with her bed on one side, and her computer, where she was presently sitting, on the other. Before Brian could get a good glimpse, Lucy tabbed to something else, then turned to Brian, her face flush, &quot;Get out!&quot; Brian of course, walked over and flopped down on her bed, stretching out. &quot;What ya doing sis?&quot; Rather than answering his question, his sister glared at him, &quot;This is your last warning before I make you leave.&quot; Looking at his watch, Brian saw about 2 minutes had passed and did some quick math, she should be about 5 ft 4 now. &quot;Eh, I&#39;m fine, your bed is kind of comfy.&quot; He responded, &quot;So again, what ya doing?&quot; A look of anger on her face, Lucy got up and stalked towards Brian. &quot;Last chance, for real this time!&quot; she growled. &quot;Eh, I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Brian said, &quot;Two days isn&#39;t long enough for a mark to fade, you can beat me in a fight, sure, but if there&#39;s a fight, you won&#39;t be able to deny it to the parents.&quot; Lucy just stands there, glaring. &quot;So,&quot; Brian starts, &quot;Was the porn good?&quot;<br />
<br />
With an outraged scream, Lucy launched herself at Brian, 4 minutes in she was just under 5 feet, and still somehow not noticing her reduced stature. Grappling, the twins fell to the floor, scrambling for any handhold or advantage. Brian, reaching for any handhold he could get, grabbed Lucy&#39;s now oversized shirt. Pulling on that resulted in the shirt sliding over her head until her arms got caught. Taking advantage of his sister&#39;s inability to see, Brian quickly scrambled up and began to pull Lucy further by her shirt. As she slid across the floor, her oversized pants slid off, followed closely by her panties. Finally Lucy struggled out of her shirt and swung her feet around, knocking Brian&#39;s feet out from under him. She quickly moved to pin him. &quot;You little abomination!&quot; Lucy screamed, &quot;You tried to strip me, your sister, what is wrong with you?!&quot; Carefully reaching for her panties and slipping them on, Lucy moved herself into a better position, &quot;Seriously! I&#39;m your twin and you try to see me naked?&quot; Brian, wincing as she screamed into his ear, carefully checked his watch. All said and done, the fight had taken about 2 minutes, which meant Lucy was now just a little over 4 and a half feet tall, from his current position, Brian could see Lucy&#39;s bra was barely covering anything, and if she stood up she&#39;d probably lose her panties. In her rage though, Lucy was oblivious to the changes. &quot;You want to strip me!?&quot; She screamed again, &quot;Well I can turn that around!&quot; She grabbing the bottom of Brian&#39;s pants and Brian took in a breath, &quot;You don&#39;t want to do this Lucy.&quot; Lucy gave a sharp tug, bringing them to his ankles, &quot;Well, tough!&quot;  His boxers, then his shirt, leaving him nude with his sister on top of him in her underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for your punishment.&quot; Lucy said. Brian felt a sharp blow to his backside as her hand came down, followed by another. Howling in pain, Brian told himself to just wait. She only weighed 98 pounds, but the pin was keeping him down, in a little longer though she won&#39;t be able to hold it effectively, he just needed to wait five more minutes.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
After 4 minutes of pain, Lucy&#39;s hand stopped. &quot;Now for the best part.&quot; She grinned. At only 76 pounds and just under 3 and 3/4 feet, she was on the cusp of losing her position, but completely unaware. Her bra was hanging from her chest, completely ineffective, and her panties covered nothing, but she was oblivious, riding the high of revenge. &quot;Now what I&#39;m going to do now, is flip you over and tie this sheet to your dick,&quot; She grinned, &quot;Then I&#39;m going to pick you up with it, and suspend you somewhere, your entire weight held by your dick, until you pass out from pain.&quot; Brian tilted his head and looked at her in horror at that idea, she was clearly pissed off, she had hurt him before, said it was to &quot;establish his place&quot;, but never that bad. They were just as smart, the 150 IQ came easily, and he knew, if she wasn&#39;t considering the repercussions to her, then she was very, very, angry. Lucky for him, the time was up. Lucy transferred her hands to another pin, then began to roll her twin over slowly. However, when she was halfway, Brian suddenly finished the turn, throwing himself into her and breaking the hold. Rolling off of his 72 pound sister, Brian placed a hand on her chest to keep her from getting up, a maneuver that was all too effective at her size. Looking at his small sister, Brian laughed. &quot;So I heard you were going to torture me.&quot; His sister looked up at him in horror as her violent struggles proved completely ineffective. Reaching for his underwear, Brian slipped it on, then stood up and placed a foot on his sister, enjoying her look of horror as she realized how small she was. &quot;Wha.. What happened?&quot; She stuttered. &quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious,&quot; Brian replied with a grin, &quot;You shrunk! By my estimates you&#39;re about, &quot; Checking his watch, he saw that it was now 13 minutes in, &quot;About 3 and half feet tall and 68 pounds.&quot; Watching as his twin gaped, Brian leaned over her, &quot;I think I might have to have revenge though for earlier, it was quite painful, while I&#39;m at it might as well take advantage of what you planned too. First though, let&#39;s get rid of these...&quot; He said as he reached down and removed her bra, and panties, now larger than her head.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Looking down at his sister&#39;s cute little butt, Brian grinned at her futile struggling. Bringing his hand down hard once, then again, he smacked her until she lay whimpering, her entire backside red. Checking his watch, Brian see&#39;s it&#39;s been 20 minutes since he activated the program. That puts her at almost exactly 2 feet tall, and about 40 pounds. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s go.&quot; Brian said, lifting up the sobbing girl, &quot;There, there, it&#39;ll be alright.&quot; He said mockingly, patting her on the back. Back in his room, Brian closed his door, then placed his twin on his bed and said, &quot;Alright, you have 8 minutes to relax.&quot; Then he walked back over to the computer and unlocked it. Scrolling through the options, he found the ones he was looking for: Pain and Injury.<br />
<br />
Pain Tolerance: Medium<br />
Pain Adjustment Amount (The maximum amount a person can be desensitized to pain when experiencing it): 70%<br />
Injury Recovery Rate (the rate at which a person heals to the point where they no longer feel pain from the injury): 100%<br />
Maximum Injury (The maximum injury which can be taken): None<br />
Pain w/out Injury (Does the person feel pain from something blocked by maximum injury at the same amount as if the setting was off?): Off<br />
<br />
Tweaking the values, Brian sets it to:<br />
Pain Tolerance: Extremely Low<br />
Pain Adjustment Amount: 0%<br />
Injury Recovery Rate: 2800%<br />
Maximum Injury: Healable (Only injuries which can heal properly through natural processes are taken)<br />
Pain w/out Injury: On<br />
<br />
Clicking apply elicited a shriek of pain from Lucy, before she went back to whimpering. Brian looked back up at the countdown to see there&#39;s still 4 minutes left, and that Lucy was just 1&#39; 3&quot; tall. Walking over to her, he finds he curled into a ball. Picking her up and rubbing her back, Brian whispers soothingly, &quot;Shh, it&#39;ll be ok, you&#39;ll be alright soon.&quot; Lucy begins to calm down, and after only a minute, she uncurls, and whispers hoarsely, &quot;You can put me down now.&quot; Brian gently sets his sister down, and she yelps and jumps right back up, tenderly holding her hand to her rear. She stands there looking embarrassed, then looks down at herself and moves her arms to cover herself. &quot;Umm, Brian, can I have some clothes please?&quot; She whispers pleadingly. Brian makes a show of looking thoughtful, before saying, &quot;No. You tried to strip me, you can be naked.&quot; He reaches over and moves her arms out from covering her, then pokes her breast. Lucy squeaks, but Brian continues talking, &quot;Anyway, you do know the whole reason why I&#39;m doing this right?&quot; Cautiously, Lucy let&#39;s out a &quot;No&quot;. Brian reaches over and pokes her other breast, Lucy squealed, &quot;Stop that!&quot; But Brian ignores her, &quot;It&#39;s because of control. Usually you control me, for one reason and one reason only, you&#39;re stronger. I&#39;ve had to live with you bossing me around. I love you, I really do, but it&#39;s time you learn what it&#39;s like to be physically coerced on the threat of pain.&quot; Reaching over, Brain cups Lucy&#39;s butt in one hand, then runs his finger from her neck downwards, squishing her breasts, tickling her belly, then stroking her crotch, &quot;Or other stuff...&quot; Brian finishes, looking at Lucy&#39;s humiliated face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now here&#39;s how this is going to work,&quot; Brian said, jumping up with Lucy still cupped in his hand, eliciting a scream. You stay small this weekend, and other than that, it&#39;s normal. I&#39;ll help you where you need help, but I&#39;m in charge. Hey, we could even come up with a bunch of ways to make this fun! I look forward to seeing what games we can come up with together, especially with my fancy computer over there. Hopefully by the end, you&#39;ll have learned your lesson, and we can go back to being equals, the way things were before mom and dad first let us stay home alone for a week and you got the chance to beat me up.&quot; Looking at Lucy&#39;s hopeful face, Brian grinned, &quot;First though, there&#39;s one thing we have to do. Remember that threat you gave me before I overpowered you? You were going to put all my weight into being supported by a rope around my penis? Well it just so happens it&#39;s easy to transfer that to female anatomy.&quot; Lucy scrambled at this news, &quot;But I didn&#39;t do it! You stopped me!&quot; Dumping her on the table Brian laughed at her horror, &quot;But you were going to. Take this as a lesson to not abuse me in the future.&quot; Grabbing a pencil, Brian stuck it in the sharpener. &quot;So I&#39;m going to stick you on the top of this pencil for an hour while I have lunch, it&#39;ll hurt, but I&#39;ve made sure you won&#39;t retain any injuries from it, and you&#39;ll get over the pain quickly. In fact, on topic here, your butt should be fine now.&quot; Brian said, lightly tapping Lucy&#39;s rear. &quot;Please don&#39;t Brian, please...&quot; Lucy pleaded. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Lucy, just know that I love you, and after this hour, the rest of the weekend should be fun for both of us.&quot; Pulling out some silly putty, Brian stuck the eraser of the newly sharpened pencil into it, such that the point was sticking up. Then he carefully positioned Lucy&#39;s vagina over the point, and lightly pressed downwards. Her shriek was loud even at her size, and quickly faded into tears. &quot;See you in an hour sis!&quot; Brian called over his shoulder as he locked his computer, and closed the door.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
An hour later, Brian returned to quiet sobbing in his room. Seeing his sister&#39;s face twisted into agony, he felt a pang of guilt. Gently lifting her off the pencil, he whispered to her, &quot;Shh, it&#39;ll be ok, you&#39;ll feel better soon.&quot; He walked over and grabbed a microfiber cloth, then wrapped his twin in it and gently stroked her back, walking to the computer. Setting pain tolerance and pain adjustment amount to return to normal in 5 minutes, then locking the computer again, Brian carried his sister downstairs. Five minutes later, his sister&#39;s quiet whimpering ceased, and she took a deep breath, &quot;I&#39;m ok now.&quot; She whispered. &quot;Alright,&quot; Brian replied softly, &quot;Let&#39;s not do that again, alright?&quot; His sister merely nodded, still calming down. &quot;When your ready, I made you lunch, you&#39;re probably hungry. Tell me whenever.&quot; Leaning her head against his finger, Lucy whispered, &quot;Not yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Brian said as Lucy finished eating, &quot;We still have the weekend, and now we can do fun stuff, what do you want to do?&quot; Getting up and walking over to Brian, Lucy looked upwards and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, can I get some clothes though?&quot; Wincing, Brian replied, &quot;I don&#39;t actually know if I can get you clothes, right now just use the cloth, anything I get you isn&#39;t going to be comfortable at all, but the microfiber cloth should be soft.&quot; Sitting down, Lucy sighed, &quot;Alright then, you decide what we do next, cause I have no idea.&quot; Thoughts flashed through Brian&#39;s mind, they could use the Chronivac, or just play around with Lucy being small. Eventually he decided they should...</p>
