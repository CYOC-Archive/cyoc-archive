<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juliana was at her office filling out e-paperwork related to school board business, mostly having to do with the immediate affects the Great Change would have on school policy and such, daydreaming about her date night with Millie Aaronsohn the previous evening. It had been magical to say the least, and Juliana was wondering with glee if Millie was really the one, her true love, her meant to be. She was even speculating about a future wedding, but that was way down the road. The two needed a couple of more dates to know if they were truly right for one another. <br />
<br />
She looked up to see someone knocking on the door twice before letting themselves in. <br />
<br />
At the door was the principle of the school, Jenna Negrotti. Jenna, who had already been young and attractive to begin with prior to the Great Change, she was actually the youngest principle in the county at twenty-six years old, had not changed physically from either of Jean&#39;s wishes very much, if at all. Mentally, she was now a lesbian of course, but she hadn&#39;t cared very much about that. It&#39;s all pink in the dark was her philosophy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Juliana&quot; she said officially. &quot;Can I have a minute?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; said Juliana, smiling, and Jenna sat across from Juliana. The latter realized to her obtuse surprise that they had been wearing the exact same outfit.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s come to my attention that you and Millie Aaronsohn, the kindergarten teacher on the first floor, are experimenting with having a relationship. Don&#39;t ask who, but you were spotted entering Ms. Aaronsohn&#39;s apartment yesterday evening, and after all that&#39;s happened over these last twenty-four hours, people begin to speculate. It&#39;s none of my business, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait..you&#39;re seriously not saying there&#39;s a problem with two women staying together for the night?&quot; asked Juliana in a huff. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think it&#39;s adorable&quot; laughed Jenna mirthfully. &quot;Ms. Aaronsohn was a kind man, and now that her insecurities about being a man in a traditionally woman&#39;s job are gone, I believe she&#39;ll be an even better kindergarten teacher than she already was. It&#39;s just, not that I&#39;m trying to shame you or Millie, just keep your relationship on the down low, OK?&quot; asked Jenna hopefully, holding Juliana&#39;s hand. &quot;Women may be the dominant gender now, but that doesn&#39;t mean that people&#39;s personal convictions go away. There are still lots of folks who believe that homosexuality is something they want to shield their children from. It&#39;s not what I believe, but it&#39;s a conservative country, girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t make any sense!&quot; shouted the assistant principle. &quot;Everyone is a dyke now, including you and me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but some of the more...devout new women think that this is a punishment from God. There is already a movement saying that all women should now remain celibate for life, and gracefully grow old together into extinction...&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Allison had spent most her day at school reacquainting herself with everyone, excited at seeing how all of her friends had turned out post-change. She was a lot more sociable and friendly than she had been as a boy, a perky smile consistently on her face. She figured that had to do with her upbeat girly-girl mindset and aesthetic now. She noticed that she was a lot more observant of the little details too, like what people were wearing, how they worded their sentences or how good their penmanship was. More importantly, she was more observant of personality and need now. Alan was a good guy, and had an enormous heart, but this felt different somehow. She was more empathetic. <br />
<br />
Skipping merrily in the hallway heading to her next class, the new girl had run into Sarah, her old girlfriend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah had mostly remained the same. She was an adorable, girl next door type with straight black hair. Her face screamed innocence and purity. All the Great Change had done was increase her bust size a little. She couldn&#39;t look directly in her former boyfriend&#39;s eyes, embarrassed and saddened that their relationship seemed to be over.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Is...is Logan OK? I heard what happened on SnapChat, and I had...&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison cut Sarah off.<br />
<br />
&quot;...The doctor said that she&#39;ll be fine, but they want to keep her under observation for a few days, maybe a week even, and she&#39;s obviously going to need to see a therapist now. She really took this change hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So she really slit her wrists?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison nodded in her sorrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why haven&#39;t you taken the change hard?&quot; asked Sarah, at a loss over how easily Alan have embraced femininity.  She cupped Allison&#39;s face. &quot;I want my old boyfriend back.&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
Robbie had gone back to work the next day. She had saw the new Elizabeth and was happy that she had someone to share her pain with, as Elizabeth was none too pleased with her new body. Elizabeth helped her wife get dressed, picking out which clothes would look best on her, and they enjoyed some personal time together embracing one another. After that, she drove the minivan to work, listening to talk radio along the way, most of whom believed in ridiculous or petty conspiracies about what had happened.  <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Kira was finished smacking Amanda&#39;s black ass on top of the bathroom sink for failing to properly give her oral until it was red as a baboon&#39;s. She smacked it one more time for good luck, this time extra hard, and then pulled down Amanda&#39;s black and white checkered skirt to hide the damage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now get your ass to class&quot; she said domineeringly, pointing at the bathroom door. Amanda, still wearing the slave collar that Kira had affixed to her earlier, had a small smirk and said &quot;Yes, my Queen&quot;. She gave her ass a little wiggle to her mistress as she sashayed out the door. Kira could hear Amanda&#39;s excited giggle as the door closed.<br />
<br />
Before Kira could reapply her paddle to her waist, two white girls, Allison Parker and Sarah Clarke, had entered the bathroom to quietly talk their new relationship out. <br />
<br />
It was Kira who first noticed her teammate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alan&quot; she said, whacking her paddle against her hand, &quot;Looking good, girl. Have you ever wanted to be fucked by a black chick?&quot;.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Little Jill Ashton raised her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; asked Ms. Millie Aaronsohn sweetly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Aaronsohn, where do babies come from now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie grabbed her shirt collar a little and tugged at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever do you mean, Jill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that there are no boys, where do babies come from? I came from my mommy, who was in love with my daddy, and they decided to have me. But now there are only girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie honestly didn&#39;t know how to answer that. Where DID babies come from now?<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Jo had tried for hours to escape the clutches of her new parents, Kayla and Martha Saviano, who apparently were old people turned young, or they had just REALLY enjoyed the TV series Mad Men, as their house was still largely furnished and decorated in a 1960s fashion. Jo, who although an infant still maintained her teenage boy mind, was assuming the former presumption based on how they talked to each other. <br />
<br />
She had miraculously grabbed a pencil with her little baby hands when the adults weren&#39;t paying attention. She would write for help and explain the situation. Then somehow...somehow they would take Jo to Doctor Von Hauser and get his magic ring back, something that Jo had felt entitled to. But right now she in an old fashioned wooden crib, the very one Kyle had been born in 1915 in. Kayla and Martha had gone out to buy diapers, baby formula, baby food, and so on, and after Kayla mostly had played with her, Jo was put in this crib and expected to nap for a while. <br />
<br />
She had to find something write on, but what?<br />
<br />
**<br />
&quot;So who are you two?&quot; asked Elizabeth. She hated speaking in her new teenage voice. It sounded so immature. The white woman in the severe looking bun spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elizabeth, first of all, thank you.&quot; she began. &quot;I am Dr. Greta Von Hauser, and this is my receptionist turned lover, Jean Doudna. We both read your Facebook polemic today while browsing the internet, and it gave both of us great interest in what you have to say. You are a good writer and a good thinker, Ms. Marshall.  We&#39;re the ones who caused this Great Change, as it&#39;s being called. We want to know what damage we are truly causing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, how the hell did you teleport me here?&quot; asked Elizabeth impatiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;With this&quot; said Greta, showing Elizabeth her hand. &quot;It&#39;s a magic ring. It&#39;s what caused the Great Change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic? Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t believe it myself at first either&quot; explained Jean. &quot;We just kind of stumbled into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it. Let me see the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greta shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that is impossible. I put the ring on my finger, and a voice in my head, whoever made this device I presume, told me that nothing could remove the ring from my finger. We tried everything, and it would not budge. So we decided to make the most of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not villains from a superhero movie&quot; said Jean. &quot;We don&#39;t have any evil master plan in mind. We just want to make the world a better place, and I can hold my hand on a stack of bibles and say with a clear conscious that a world without men is better than a one with men.&quot; <br />
<br />
Greta held Jean&#39;s hand tightly.<br />
<br />
How can you say that!?&quot; demanded Elizabeth. &quot;You&#39;ve taken people&#39;s identities from them! People have already ended their lives over this. According to the news, a high school boy slit his wrists after he had transformed. My husband, my wife I mean, she can barely cope with this either. She cried herself to sleep last night because she believes she can&#39;t provide for her family anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toxic masculinity&quot; said Greta. &quot;Are you familiar with the term?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; answered Elizabeth. &quot;I know exactly what toxic masculinity is, and I find it abhorrent. Gender is largely a social construct. It shouldn&#39;t matter whether women are the providers and men are the caretakers, or vice versa, and macho bullshit is macho bullshit no matter how you slice it. If you really understood that, doctor, you&#39;d know that transforming men into women isn&#39;t going to change who they are deep down inside. We&#39;re still going to go to war. We&#39;re still going to have gangs, and rapists, and human trafficking. A world full of women isn&#39;t going to create world peace. Hell, statistics show that domestic violence among lesbian couples is just as bad as among straight ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jean replied &quot;If you knew what happened to us before we were blessed with this ring, you wouldn&#39;t be so self righteous. Let me tell you a story of how mine and Greta&#39;s day went yesterday...&quot;</p>
