<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Master Bruno is playing hide-n-seek with the new toy thought Max. As Bruno raced out back to finish the yard, he made sure Max stayed out of the house on the porch. Max stay. Yeah, Max stay, the dog thought grumpily. Then Max heard Bruno&#39;s mother coming out. Keys rattled. She go bye.<br />
<br />
She shouted, &quot;Bruno, dinner&#39;s in the fridge. Girls&#39; night out. Behave! Love ya!&quot; Then she headed for her big metal traveling machine. Max was on his feet licking and barking, and making sure his butt stopped the kitchen door from swinging completely shut, when ordered to stay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stay, Max,&quot; she ordered, then she shouted and left the porch. Max immediately sat on the kitchen door threshold.<br />
<br />
Max barked his goodbyes as he sat. Max waited to make sure that she was gone, and Master Bruno wasn&#39;t coming in. Then he nudged the door open, and closed it with his snout.<br />
<br />
Now where is my humptoy? Max wonder. He sniffed. He could smell the guy from nextdoor mixed with rubber. He could smell his humptoy. Now where did Master hide it. Max followed his nose. He was soon outside Bruno&#39;s bedroom door.<br />
<br />
Max appeared peering under Bruno&#39;s bed. Then teeth sank into Chad&#39;s inflated rubber arm pulling him out from under the bed. It stood with its unsheathed cock over Chad&#39;s head, and its front paws on his hips, Max started to chew Chad&#39;s rubber rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh, muuhx,buuuhd og, muh chudnuhchuhtoy,&quot; Chad wheezed.<br />
<br />
Max growled and barked. Chad for the first time seemed to understand the words meant by Max. He understood, &quot;yeah, yeah, &quot;Grrr. Chad not chewtoy. Better, Chad humptoy.&quot; Then he grabbed Chad firmly by his penis, and flipped him on his belly.<br />
<br />
The next thing Chad knew, his cock was painfully flattened between the floor of Bruno&#39;s bedroom, and the weight of Max mounting his new humptoy.<br />
<br />
&quot;NuhYUUUUH!&quot; Chad yelped as Max penetrated and knotted him.<br />
<br />
As Chad was knotted he felt like his skin was oozing on the inside. His arms and legs shifted. His whole body felt different. Chad had closed his eyes when Max impaled and knotted inside him. The pain and changes happening were overwhelming.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes. He could feel the floor beneath his palms and soles, but his body was parallel with the ground. He looked down at his hands. They looked like black rubber paws. He looked between his arms, which were really fore legs now. He could see his legs were shorter, thinner and ended in paws too. His cock was attached to his belly by a black rubber sheath, but his now pointy cock was fully unsheathed, erect and bright red.  When looked up, he noticed a full length mirror opposite, he freaked when he saw his reflection. He looked like a black rubber inflatable sheep at his brother Brad&#39;s fraternity. Brad graduated a couple years ago, and now ran a dog training and boarding kennel. Max had been one of the first dogs he trained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Belong to me, Chad mine, belong to me, Chad mine,&quot; panted Max as he pumped canine cum into Chad&#39;s bowels.<br />
<br />
Chad whimpered like a frightened dog.<br />
<br />
Chad was unsure what to do, or whether there was anything he could do.  It seemed like he was becoming Max&#39;s custom sex dog. At least he still appeared male. His color vision started to fade. His face was pushing foward to form a muzzle like a dog. Everything was becoming monochrome, and his other senses seemed more intense.  He heard the kitchen door open and close. He heard footsteps running up the stairs. He smelled a weirdly sweet, crispy masculine human scent just as Bruno threw open the door to his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you started without me, Max! Whoa! Chad you look different. Say ah, dog boy!&quot; Bruno said whipping his hardening cock out of his Speedo. Chad tried to say, no, but only barks were emitted. <br />
<br />
As Bruno fucked Chad&#39;s face, Chad could smell the blades of fresh mown grass mixed with Bruno&#39;s sweat, and the scent of male sex. The whole time, Max the dog chanted, &quot;Mine, Chad, mine,mine,mine, mine...&quot;  Chad couldn&#39;t help but think of that greedy  Loony Tunes&#39; duck repeating the same words, &quot;mine, mine, mine,&quot; if only he was in a cartoon, then this would all be over when Porky Pig announced &quot;That&#39;s all folks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was startled to see his eyes moving closer to Bruno&#39;s pubes. Then he noticed the colors all 7 of them on Bruno&#39;s rainbow tattoo.  It started at his hip mostly hidden by his Speedo, and ended at the root of Bruno&#39;s penis. He had said he got it because he had to wax off his treasure trail for swimming. <br />
<br />
When Bruno and Max finally pulled out, Chad saw his reflection in the mirror. He had his human head back, but his body belonged to a male dog. He was still rubber, and mostly inanimate. He couldn&#39;t move. He just stood there and stared at his reflection<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Chad, now you look more like yourself,&quot; Bruno said flopping back on his bed. Max quickly joined him. &quot;That&#39;s a good boy Max.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max barked, &quot;Max belongs to Bruno, Chad belongs to Max. Chad good dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad could still understand Max, even if his head looked human. He was a beta in Max&#39;s pack, owned by Master Bruno and Master Max. Life&#39;s a bitch, thought Chad defeatedly.</p>
