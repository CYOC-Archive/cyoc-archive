<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where&#39;d it go lil&#39; buddy? Where&#39;d it go?&quot; Steven mocked Henry as the little man squirmed on the couch. &quot;It&#39;s so small I can barely even see it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry tried to fight with all his strength, but couldn&#39;t compete against the near bodybuilder sized man on top of him. Steven&#39;s massive body easily pinned him down to the couch while his thick rugged hands barely had to do anything to keep him there. Meanwhile, Henry already had a second time that he finished and it was moving onto a third. His cock just seemed to remain hard as Steven kept touching him.<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP IT!&quot; Henry was finally able to squirm his way out of the other man&#39;s grasp. &quot;Why won&#39;t you just hit the button twice already? I know you hate that body you&#39;re in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven smirked. &quot;And you hate that one. You always complained about being small, now look at you. What kind of man looks like that? Hmmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry was hurt. He&#39;d told Steven those things in confidence. &quot;WELL! You&#39;re big and brutish. When Bridgette asked to see your dick, now you can show her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here you little shit!&quot; Steven marched over to the other side of the room. Henry tried to run, but the small apartment didn&#39;t have many places to go to. &quot;If you won&#39;t hit the button twice, I&#39;ll make you.&quot; He grabbed Henry&#39;s hand and placed it over the button, hitting it twice. Nothing seemed to change. &quot;What the hell bro? You hit it twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry pulled out of the grasp and headed to the box. He read through the rules. &quot;Something about it says that it has to be willingly pushed twice. So the game can tell if I did it or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro! That&#39;s bullshit! I&#39;ve gotta be at the gym in like 6 hours. Just hit the fuckin&#39; button and let us be done with this!&quot; Steven said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heck no!&quot; Henry stomped back over, shoving his little finger into Steven&#39;s massive pecs. &quot;You push it twice!&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven let out a grunt. &quot;Wait... Bro. Wait a second. What&#39;d I just fuckin&#39; say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta be at the gym in six hours?&quot; Henry repeated back to him. His voice went soft and was full of confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro. Why the fuck would I be going so early?&quot; Steven asked. Then looked at his massive arm and flexed. A cheeky smile filled his face as he watched the impressively built muscle bounce. It had to be at least the size of a soft ball if not a little bigger. &quot;Wait. What the hell?&quot; he uttered. He cringed as he reflected on his own vanity. &quot;I&#39;m supposed to have cheer practice. Why is the only thing I plan on doing is going to the gym?&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry took a moment to think about it as well. He didn&#39;t have much planned for the next day. Just some football practice in the afternoon, yet all he could think about was tutoring Franky at 10am. A thought of the naked man flashed through his mind. He felt his cock harden as he thought about the other man&#39;s impressive bulk and the hefty weight of his penis pushing deep inside of him. He let out a breath then gasped. Then shook his head, desperately trying to get the thought out of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo. Just hit the button twice,&quot; Steven pleaded.<br />
<br />
Looking at the clock, it&#39;d passed over to the next day. It was currently 12:35. Neither one had been paying attention to the time. &quot;No way!&quot; Henry tried to sound tough but his high pitched voice only made him sound like he was pouting. Even as he crossed his arms over his flat chest, he looked cute rather than intimidating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I ain&#39;t fuckin&#39; pushin it,&quot; Steven declared. &quot;Might as well go to bed then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine!&quot; Henry replied, following him into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Steven stripped off the string sleeveless shirt and pulled up a pair of stained boxers. Meanwhile, Henry pulled out what had been one of Steven&#39;s old workout shirts and a pair of tight fitting underwear. The shirt had several holes from wear as it had pushed hard against his growing muscles. The smell of his sweat still coated the shirt and in return coated Henry with the distinct smell of his sweat. &quot;EEP!&quot; Henry realized what was going on. He tried to look for something else to wear, but nothing looked like it would be comfortable.<br />
<br />
He shot a glare at Steven, only making the bodybuilder sized guy laugh a bit harder. The big guy got into his side of the bed and the two tried to fall asleep. However, it was harder for Steven than he thought it would be. His hormones were still raging. Even though he&#39;d just finished a little over an hour ago, his cock was rock hard again. His big hands kept going down, trying their best to massage it, but it only made his mind fill with more dirty thoughts. <br />
<br />
Steven tossed and turned before finally giving up. He leaned over into Henry&#39;s ear, gently cuddling the smaller man. &quot;Bro... I can&#39;t sleep,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
Henry kept his eyes closed. &quot;How&#39;s that my problem? Go push the button twice if you&#39;re so uncomfortable.&quot; He turned away, but Steven&#39;s strong arms were still holding him. Without so much as an effort, Henry was pulled into Steven&#39;s body and knew exactly why Steven couldn&#39;t sleep. The hard cock pushed against his backside and he fought with all his might not to let out a moan. His face burned red as he gripped the sheets.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon man... Pleaseee...&quot; Steven begged softly. Henry fought off as long as he could trying his best not to seem interested. &quot;Look. I&#39;m sorry. Okay? How about after this is all over, I let you do whatever you want to me. Hmmm?&quot; He offered. It was more out of desperation as he pulled Henry a bit tighter to his body.<br />
<br />
A deep breath slowly exited Henry&#39;s mouth as he tried to focus. His ass was tingling like crazy and his cock was throbbing like it&#39;d never been touched. &quot;For real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For real...&quot; The deep bass of Steven&#39;s voice whispered gently into Henry&#39;s ear. He could feel the little man buck at the proposition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Henry lamented as he pulled the thong down slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; Steven cheered. He fished his cock out of his boxers and pressed it against Henry&#39;s asshole. It was already leaking like crazy. almost on instinct, Steven shifted his weight to be on top of his boyfriend. Though, it helped that Henry seemed to naturally take the position as well. The small man lifted his backside up just enough to open up his anus. <br />
<br />
Steven took his time, gently pushing the mushroom tip against the hole. &quot;Fuck yeah...&quot; he moaned, biting at his bottom lip as his cock slid inside. More pre dripped into Henry&#39;s hole, coating it with something slick. He pushed deeper. The tight asshole clenched against his cock. Steven chuckled at the sensation. He&#39;d never felt something like this. The tight feeling around such a sensitive member as he pulled in and out was unbelievable. It was like he was in a whole new world. Everything felt so good. So pleasurable.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t stop. Each thrust sent him a little further but then it was like he needed more. Steven sped up. Each thrust was a bit shorter. Faster. A grunt escaped him. Then another. Nature was taking over. He didn&#39;t want to think about it. Only feel the erotic joy from fucking his boyfriend. &quot;OH FUCK YEAH!&quot; he bellowed out. <br />
<br />
Henry bit into the pillow as he felt the hefty load burst inside of him. His little hands gripped the sheets with all their might. Never in his life had he thought he&#39;d been in this position. Never did he think that he&#39;d enjoy it. As he felt Steven slide out of him, he couldn&#39;t help but feel his face turn bright red. The soft kiss to his neck was even less expected. Henry rushed to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
It was the only safe place he could think of going as he tried his best to not make a mess and clean himself up. In the calm silence of the bathroom, he was able to think. Even as his tiny dick throbbed with need he sat on the toilet wondering what the hell this game was doing to them. More importantly, did he actually enjoy it...</p>
