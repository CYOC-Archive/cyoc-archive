<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Nessa&#39;s swim in Loch Ness didn&#39;t confirm the existence of the Loch Ness Monster, she wasn&#39;t going to leave Scotland without a Nessie. She made a call to Horizon Labs to report her lack of success, but also to talk to them about Elise. She wanted her old friend another chance at life, but she lacked the means of doing it herself at the moment. And Elise wasn&#39;t going to America. Her health might not be as brittle as she said it was, but she didn&#39;t look fit for a long journey.<br />
<br />
The answer came a lot sooner than Nessa was expecting. Before her scheduled flight back to America, an express flight came to Edinburgh. On it were both a scientist from Horizon with the necessary syringes needed to take care of Nessa and Dr. Jones. &quot;Ye didn&#39;t have ta come yourself,&quot; said Nessa as she greeted Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, considering how the US government is concerned about Regressive Hypersexuality, I will need to evaluate Elise after her conversion,&quot; said Dr. Jones, &quot;I hope this won&#39;t take long. I have therapists to review back in Lyre.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nessa studied Dr. Jones, noticing the bags under his eyes. &quot;You&#39;re the one that really needs a vacation,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no time for that,&quot; said Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would ye say when a patient, let&#39;s say a doctor, has been puttin&#39; off rest to work?&quot; asked Nessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say they were endangering themselves and possibly their patients on account of they&#39;d be too tired to make proper-&quot; said Dr. Jones before realizing he walked right into that one. &quot;Ok, you&#39;re right. I do need a vacation,&quot; said Dr. Jones, &quot;But first, I&#39;ll have to make sure I have people that can cover for me while I&#39;m away.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Considering Elise was going to need more room to grow, Aggie got a little help from the family to move her to the castle. When she was settled in one of the castle&#39;s bedrooms, the Horizon scientist talked with her. &quot;Now, I understand you&#39;re wanting to be a pleasiosaur,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like ta be able ta swim again and if there ain&#39;t no Nessie, somebody might as well fill in,&quot; said Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, fortunately for you, we&#39;ve gotten a serum ready for <i>Cryptoclidus</i>,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
Elise gave the scientist a confused look and said, &quot;What in the name of Mary, Queen of Scots is a Crypto-whatis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a species of pleasiosaur, smaller than <i>Elasmosaurus</i>, but with a more flexible neck. We did add a bit of snake DNA to make sure you won&#39;t have neck problems,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why give me DNA from this beastie?&quot; asked Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, many of the choices for Project Dinotopia Aquatica has been influenced by &#39;Walking with Dinosaurs&#39;, though pleasiosaurs aren&#39;t closely related to dinosaurs themselves,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t ye have straight-up <i>Pleasiosaurus</i> instead o&#39; of these obscure cousins o&#39; it?&quot; asked Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, eventually, yes. The choices of ancient marine reptiles will become broader once the colony as Skull Island is settled. We&#39;ll probably see more itchyosaurs and mosasaurs as well,&quot; said the scientist. Drawing a syringe, he said, &quot;This is enough for a single dose. As this is the only serum for <i>Cryptoclidus</i> that currently exists, a secondary dose from another strain will have to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment, Sonny Jim,&quot; said Elise, &quot;Ye say another dose from another species will be enough, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, which is why-&quot; started the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let Nessa do it for me,&quot; said Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if that&#39;s what you want, but Nessa has been vaccinated,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t take me fer a daft ol&#39; granny,&quot; said Elise, &quot;Ye were plannin&#39; on havin&#39; Nessa change me if I didn&#39;t wanna be yer Crypto monster, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As an alternative,&quot; started the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then ye must have something ta make her able ta convert me. And ye were already gonna vaccinate me afterwards so she might as well be re-vaccinated too,&quot; said Elise, &quot;So get her in here before ye start pokin&#39; me with anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist briefly had reservations about letting such a strong-willed woman regain her youth. Her stubbornness could make her live to 200. But it wasn&#39;t his place to deny others their chance at a better life. He walked to the door and called, &quot;Nessa, if you could come in please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nessa was able to get into the room without too much trouble. &quot;The doctor here is givin&#39; me the first dose, but I want yer help with the second,&quot; said Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; said Nessa. Nessa hadn&#39;t ever told anyone she was a little bit bisexual. At least not directly. But when they were younger, she and Elise used to hint about a little attraction to other girls. Not that they tried anything with each other. As far as Nessa knew, Elise had never been with another woman. But it seems that Elise wanted to call up that untold history. &quot;Well, I can&#39;t turn a friend, now can I?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
The scientist prepped the needle and injected Elise with the serum. &quot;You might want to get out of your clothes as soon as you are able to,&quot; he said as he headed for the door, &quot;And welcome to Dinotopia.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the scientist left, the changes started. The worn, leathery skin on Eliss&#39;s arms started losing their liver spots and wrinkles. Then they started changing to a tan color. But that became secondary to what followed after. There were several snapping sounds coming from Elise, like a grotesque version of firecrackers. &quot;Ach...me bones...&quot; groaned Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are ye alright?&quot; asked Nessa with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;a have though...gettin&#39; rid of arthritis...would be as painful as getting it...&quot; groaned Elise.<br />
<br />
Nessa could spot another reason Elise was feeling discomfort. Her body, already shrunken by age, was starting to grow larger, making her clothes rather tight. &quot;Let me help ye with that,&quot; said Nessa as she started pulling off Elise&#39;s clothing. With Nessa&#39;s muscles and the growing restraint from Elise&#39;s growth, much of that clothing ended up being torn. But it was still a relief for Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feelin&#39; less like in a vice,&quot; said Elise with a sigh as her neck started stretching out. Her hair was falling out as her face was extending out into a muzzle, lost teeth reappearing much sharper than before. &quot;I think I&#39;ll be needin&#39; a drink ta get through the rest,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;O&#39; course, Elise,&quot; said Nessa before pulling off her own shirt and unfastening her bra. Elise extended her neck forward and put her lips to Nessa&#39;s nipple. Nessa gave a small moan as Elise started suckling from her. Her contaminated milk was making its effect pretty obvious already. The tan, scaly skin on Elise&#39;s body was getting tighter and more lustrous. Muscles that had been atrophying were regaining their strength before bulking up. Elise&#39;s breasts were swelling to be pretty large themselves. Elise&#39;s tail was growing out to properly aid her in swimming, a pair of flukes on the end.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Nessa pulled Elise&#39;s head away from her breast and said, &quot;Let&#39;s have a look at ye.&quot; In several ways, Elise resembled Nessa. The main differences were their colors. Nessa was darker green with black stripes on the back and a lime green front. Elise was mostly tan, with a dark back. Elise&#39;s neck was also noticeably shorter than Nessa&#39;s. Though in general shape, the two pleasiosaur women were near identical. &quot;Ye sure turned out good-lookin&#39;, Elise,&quot; said Nessa.<br />
<br />
Elise gave a small snort and said, &quot;If I&#39;m livin&#39; a new life, I may as well have a new name as well. What do ye think of &#39;Nellie&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a fine name,&quot; said Nessa, her eyes drifting a bit towards Nellie&#39;s impressive breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose it&#39;d only be fair ta let ye have a drink,&quot; said Nellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just a little curious,&quot; said Nessa before leaning her neck down to taste Nellie&#39;s teat. Her milk was much like Nessa&#39;s own, which was still odd considering they were reptiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect yer wantin&#39; ta try out the rest o&#39; me,&quot; said Nellie.<br />
<br />
Nessa lifted her head and said, &quot;Well, not that strongly. I mean, I am curious, but not compelled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nellie shrugged and said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be givin&#39; up men any time soon either. Maybe it&#39;s just the beast instincts or maybe we&#39;re not as bi as we think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind lickin&#39; myself off every once in a while,&quot; said Nessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;A wee too much information,&quot; said Nellie, &quot;Interesting, but too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose next we&#39;ll be havin&#39; Dr. Jones see if yer gonna sex-crazy,&quot; said Nessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not when I&#39;m naked, ye aren&#39;t,&quot; snapped Nellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, maybe that&#39;s the second thing then,&quot; said Nessa.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
A fitting, dressing, and psyche evaluation later seemed to indicate Nellie could potentially become susceptible to Regressive Hypersexuality. Though it was much different from the ones Martin and Stuart have. For females, the symptoms are the reversal of menopause. It was still yet to be determined what the trigger for males was.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Nellie was quickly becoming a local celebrity. She wasn&#39;t planning on becoming the official Loch Ness Monster, but she was drawing more business to MacDuff&#39;s Castle. That was quite a bit of notoriety of being the second Animalian to be living in the UK. (The first being Lord Chumly.) Nessa was planning on inviting Nellie to see Skull Island later, but first it was time for her to return to Lyre.</p>
