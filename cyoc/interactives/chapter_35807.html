<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night after the party Declan was taking his bath and thinking about his life now. Steve had said that their friendship would be awkward now that Declan was a seven year old girl, people might talk. He knew that Steve was right about that which put him in a depressed mood.<br />
<br />
The bathroom door opened and Declan's mother came in asking &quot;Ready to wash your hair Daisy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I can wash my hair by myself&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a seven year old girl now and your hair is longer than what you're used to&quot; his mother said. &quot;I want to make sure all the shampoo is washed out. Besides, I had washed Katie's hair until her birthday this year. If you remember I had washed your hair until you were nine the first time around. So you have two years of me washing your hair unless I transform you into a baby girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't change me into a baby girl Mom&quot; Declan pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, you'll let me wash your hair&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Mom, you can wash my hair&quot; Declan said in a defeated tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my girl&quot; his mother said while she reached for the shower head. &quot;I know you're sad about your friends not believing you but you wanted to be a girl. Now you have to live with that choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I be a teenage girl Mom?&quot; Declan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've given that some thought and I don't think it's a good idea&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Declan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because your hormones might lead you to do something that could have serious consequences&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can handle them&quot; Declan said. &quot;I was a teenager before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that sweetie&quot; his mother said, &quot;but you're a girl now. Your hormones are different now and when you're a teen they'll be raging through your body. Being thrust into that instead of growing into it could mess with your judgment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you had thought about it&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what sweetie, after we get your paperwork done tomorrow I'll let you become a teen for a day&quot; his mother said. &quot;If you can handle it then I'll let you stay a teen. Will that be ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it will be&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
While they had been talking his mother had washed his hair. She rinsed his hair one more time then said &quot;Time to get out and get ready for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan didn't argue with his mother as he got out of the tub and wrapped a towel around himself. His mother helped him dry his hair and brush it.<br />
<br />
When Declan entered his room he saw that his mother had put out a new pair of white panties with pink hearts and a pink nightgown. Declan put them on and went to bed thinking about tomorrow when he would be a teen again.<br />
<br />
Declan's mother woke him up the next morning and helped him get dressed. She put him in a cute yellow sun dress and braided his hair. They then went down to breakfast.<br />
<br />
After a silent breakfast the two of them go to get Declan's name and birthday legally changed.<br />
<br />
It took Declan's mother awhile to find the office since it wasn't one that saw much traffic. It was in a new state of the art building on the outskirts of town. Declan couldn't help but notice that it was close to where he found the medallion.<br />
<br />
Once inside they were quickly shown into an examination room since there was no one else in the office. Declan had hardly sat on the examination table when a woman in her mid 30's came in. &quot;Hello, I'm Dr. Mezzner&quot; she said. &quot;I understand that your son has been transformed into a young girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Declan's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is your son?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked nodding at Declan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He found a medallion and decided to transform himself using a pair of his sister's panties that he had taken two years ago&quot; his mother explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK&quot; Dr. Mezzner said as she jotted down a few notes. &quot;Now, you want to change his name from Declan to Daisy and his age from 16 to 7. Is that correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, do you have the medallion with you so we can verify that it did transform your son?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; his mother said as she reached into her purse. She brought out the medallion and showed it to Dr. Mezzner.<br />
<br />
Dr. Mezzner held a strange device over the medallion and then over Declan. &quot;Well this medallion did indeed transform you&quot; she said. &quot;Now I want you to take off your clothes so I can examine you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you need to do that?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just routine to make sure everything is ok&quot; Dr. Mezzner said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; his mother said. &quot;Daisy, do what Dr. Mezzner says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK Mom&quot; Declan said as he started taking off his clothes.<br />
<br />
Once he was naked Dr. Mezzner said &quot;Now just lay back and relax. This won't take long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan did as Dr. Mezzner told him. He laid there for a few minutes until Dr. Mezzner told him he could get up and put his clothes back on.<br />
<br />
Once Declan had his clothes back on Dr. Mezzner said &quot;Everything looks OK. We'll get the paperwork done and filed today. You were a good girl Daisy so you get to pick out a little something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Mezzner opened a drawer and Declan picked out a pink plastic bracelet.<br />
<br />
On the way home Declan decided that now that his name and age was legally changed, he should start referring to himself as a girl and her new name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you were good I'll keep my word and let you become a teenage girl for today&quot; her mother said.<br />
<br />
Daisy thought it over and decided that her mother was right. If she suddenly became a teenage girl she may do something stupid. &quot;Mom, I want to remain this age for a couple more days to get used to being a girl&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright sweetie&quot; her mother said. &quot;We'll wait a couple of days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisy sat back and was determined to make the most of her situation.</p>
