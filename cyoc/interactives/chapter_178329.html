<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt opened his eyes; it was daylight. Wayne was gone. That didn’t startle him; he always left for work a bit before he’d wake.<br />
<br />
But his thoughts flooded back to the night before. And his obvious first action was to flip the sheets off his body. Was it still… there?<br />
<br />
...Nope. He was back to “normal.” <br />
<br />
Hmmph.<br />
<br />
...So did any of it actually happen? <br />
<br />
Well of-fucking-course it did. Like, holy living mother of hell. He could still smell that heavy, musky scent in the air of the bedroom. He could remember the intense <i>feeling</i> of his massive horse dick weighing his entire body down as it prodded against and pleaded for attention on his chest, what it had looked like as the head of it flared to the rhythm of his stilted breathing, how it had felt to hold something so damn heavy in his hand that… God, he could go on forever. It had been so invigorating. <br />
<br />
The power of the Chronivac... He had been acutely aware of its existence for years, but only ever dreamt of experiencing the fruits of its labor. <br />
<br />
There was no way it was a dream. But… had he imagined what happened to <i>Wayne’s</i> cock? Did his mind somehow… project the change to other people? How could it have also changed Wayne if Matt had never scanned him into the Chronivac? Did Wayne remember anything about it? <br />
<br />
What was Matt supposed to think? Was he going insane?<br />
<br />
He palmed his head. He was clearly overthinking this. Couldn’t he just appreciate last night for what it was? Holy motherfucking shit, it was the *best* night of sex he had <i>ever</i> experienced.<br />
<br />
But that thought about Wayne stuck with him throughout his entire morning. As he drove to his internship, the minutes passed... nothing else mattered in his mind. It was becoming a problem: he hadn’t sent the Monday task checklist to his bosses, so no job tasks had been assigned. No errands were run on time. But whatever. It didn’t freaking matter to him because instead there was this thing in his house on his computer called the Chronivac and <i>oh by the way</i> it had completely changed his fucking life and if he had been smart he could&#39;ve brought it to work and... who knows what. <br />
<br />
Matt left work early, still in a daze. He made up some shit to his boss about an oncoming sickness, and he needed to rest, and it must have been convincing enough because she didn’t object at all. <br />
<br />
By the time the daze wore off, Matt was sitting in front of his computer at home again. Somehow he had driven all the way home and didn&#39;t have a singular conscious thought till now. He was anxiously picking at his fingernails, trying to suppress the urge to let his transformation fantasies run wild.<br />
<br />
He expelled the buildup of nerves with a big sigh. &#39;Okay… let&#39;s think this out,&#39; he said aloud to nobody in particular. <br />
<br />
Not only did the Chronivac work, but it had apparently worked on other people. Alternatively, it had *convinced* him that it worked on other people - down to the most intimate of physical experiences. <br />
<br />
Which one was it? It was only supposed to operate on others to an extent; the person you wanted to transform had to be within range, regardless of whether they were managing the transformation. Wayne certainly wasn’t within range of the device when Matt transformed his own dick. <br />
<br />
So… had it applied the transformation when someone came within range? Maybe Wayne’s dick transformed once he entered the range of the Chronivac in the apartment. That could make sense... but that type of effect was not something he had heard about, nor was it advertised in the forums. He really didn’t want that to be a consistent feature in future changes.<br />
<br />
He needed to test his hypothesis. That was the only way he could satiate his thirst for understanding. But there was also this explosive urge… to take things to the next level. <br />
<br />
Luckily, he had the perfect guinea pig to help him. Matt took out his phone and began to text Wayne:<br />
<br />
          “Hey, come over again tonight? Dont need to say yes, last night was crazy”<br />
<br />
Whenever Wayne left early in the morning and Matt didn’t say goodbye, there was an innate sense of guilt. Especially after how well last night went, he couldn’t properly thank him. Matt slept through his departure so his frequent paranoia jumped to the conclusion that he had done something wrong and upset Wayne. <br />
<br />
In reality, it was Wayne respecting Matt’s sleep schedule by not waking him. Only a matter of seconds later, his phone buzzed, and he swiped the screen:<br />
<br />
              “Of course, big boi. Love ya”<br />
<br />
Matt grinned. Then he got nervous again. The thought of messing around with Wayne, for the benefit of himself... because the one big thing Matt didn’t yet know was how much Wayne remembered, or if he even knew.<br />
<br />
But he had to do it; he just <i>had</i> to! It’d be okay if it were temporary, right? If the theory was proven correct and it absentmindedly applied the transformation to whoever was in range, then changing Wayne while he was nearby would change Matt as well. The other important detail was to confirm whether he noticed anything different. <br />
<br />
He had to wait until Wayne got out of work anyway. So.... until then, maybe he’d look at a couple of those preinstalled packages...</p>
