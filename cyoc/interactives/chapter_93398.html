<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam&#39;s eyes shot open in realization, interrupting his own inner monologue. His peripheral vision immedately picked up the wooden bars. He was in a giant crib. Lifting his head up, he could tell he was wearing a yellow T-shirt and a diaper. <br />
<br />
Sam sat up, findding it more difficult than he expected, using the bars of the crib to help himself up into a sitting position. The sheets had teddy bear prints on them, and Sam heard and felt the smooth ruffling and crinkling sound of the plastic sheet underneath.<br />
<br />
He scanned the walls beyond the bars. The crib he was in was up against the wall farthest from the door. The wall to his right had a large sliding closet door, which was shut at the moment. At the far corner, next to the closet was what was unmistakenly a changing table, only much bigger, with a diaper genie displayed prominently next to it. Across from the changing table was a rather large rocking chair. The walls themselves were painted baby blue with bunnies stenciled in around the top edge.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s heart began to beat faster and faster, this was definitely Hannah&#39;s doing he thought.<br />
<br />
Sam shifted to his knees and tried to pull himself up to a standing position. He grabbed the railing of the crib and heaved himself up. Then he experimentally let go. He kept his balance for a moment, then suddenly his legs went all Bambi on him and he started to weeble and wobble on the mattress before falling down on his rump.<br />
<br />
Once again, he felt the squish of wet diaper between his legs. This prompted him to look down and examine the infantile garment he had woken up in. It had two tabs, one on each side. The texture was definitely that fake cloth texture, instead of the pure plastic backing .<br />
<br />
Sam picked at the waist band a little bit. Maybe the image was taped on or something. That’s when Sam noticed that right by Elmo was the signature teal oval with stylized white print, with a little yellow heart over it. For some reason, Sam couldn’t quite make out the writing, but he didn’t need to. Just like how any fat kid knows that Golden Arches and big yellow “M” mean McDonald’s, he recognizes the Pampers logo when he sees it.<br />
<br />
That’s when Sam heard footsteps coming. The door softly opened and in stepped Hannah, her curly blonde locks glistening in the morning sun. She was clad in a light purple terrycloth bathrobe, which accentuated her curvy figure. “Good morning!” Hannah cooed as she stepped in. Sam resisted the urge to cover himself . “It looks like someone is already up and awake!” Hannah practically sung as she peered down on him lying in the crib. Sam looked into her eyes. There was more than friendship in those eyes, there was love, the kind of measureless love that only a mother can have for her child. Her smile told him that he was the center of her whole world. And he hated it.<br />
<br />
“Ready to get up?” she asked, though her tone implied she didn’t truly expect an answer. Sam put down his teddy bear and held his arms up to reach for her. Hannah needed no further cues. She lowered the railing of the crib, and with impossible ease picked Sam up, and rested him on her hip.<br />
<br />
This close up, he could smell that her hair smelled of jasmine, and he breathed it in, Hannah just giggled and rubbed her nose against his. Eskimo kisses. Even through the wet diaper, Sam could feel himself pressed up against her .<br />
<br />
“Let’s get my baby boy dressed and ready,” Hannah declared, as she made a bee line for the oversized changing table. Sam put up no struggle as hannah laid him down on the rubbery mat and pulled a strap across his tummy. His breathing became shallow as Hannah&#39;s fingers went for the velcro tapes on the diaper.<br />
<br />
“Scritch.” “Scritch.”<br />
<br />
The tapes were off, and the smell of urine wafted into the air as Hannah pulled back the front of the diaper and Sam felt a definite breeze as his genitals were exposed to open air. Sam looked at his naked crotch. Hairless.<br />
<br />
After his front side had been wiped clean, Hannah crossed Sam&#39;s ankles over each other and lifted his legs up into the air by pushing up the back of the bottom heel. Sam felt Hannah gently begin to wipe his backside; first his hole, then the crack of his ass, then each cheek.<br />
<br />
“No poopies,” Hannah commented as she sanitized her step-son’s crevasse. “Oh well, maybe later after you get some num-nums in your tum-tums”. Then Hannah pulled the used diaper out from under him, and skillfully balled it up with one hand before setting Sam&#39;s legs down and tossing it into the nearby diaper genie.<br />
<br />
She then reached onto a shelf below Sam, and pulled out a fresh diaper and unfolded it. Then, just as quickly as she had slid the old one out, Hannah picked Sam&#39;s legs up and slid the new one under him. She wasn’t done yet though. Sam could see her take out a bottle of baby powder and felt it as she sprinkled it on him; first his bum, then his crotch. Hannah even smoothed it out and massaged it in with her hand, caressing his backside and genitals.<br />
<br />
This was hell he thought.<br />
<br />
He focused on the feeling as Hannah pulled the fresh diaper up between his legs, listening to the soft crinkle of diaper as she adjusted it over his hips. He felt the diaper become snug yet comfortable as Hannah taped up one side, then the other. He looked down at the fresh diaper and saw that Grover was now decorating the waistband.<br />
<br />
“All clean!” Hannah announced as if someone needed confirmation. “Now let’s get you dressed for the day.” Hannah turned to face the closet, leaving Sam strapped to the table. With the closet door opened, Sam craned his neck to see that the closet was packed with large versions of baby clothes with cute little designs on them, as well as a box or two of Pampers.<br />
<br />
Hannah brought a gray pair of shorts with an elastic waistband over to the changing table and slid them up Sam&#39;s legs and shimmied them up his hips. The leggings didn’t even cover his knees, and even though you could only see the top edge of the diaper, the tell-tale bulge below the waist did nothing to hide what Sam&#39;s undergarment was.<br />
<br />
“Arms up!” Hannah broke Sam out of his own thoughts. “Arms up! Like this, sweety!” Sam shook from his reverie and did as he was told, almost on reflex. Hannah pulled the yellow t-shirt off of him. “That’s my big boy!” she praised him, as she pulled a new red T-shirt with a little bumble bee stitched over the heart over him.<br />
<br />
She picked him up off the changing table and walked over to the rocking chair. She cradled him in her arms, and the chair was big enough to accommodate the both of them. She rocked back and forth for a moment, stroking his hair. Then she pulled back a side of her robe, revealing a naked breast.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get you some milk,” Hannah told him. Chris knew what was coming next, and he didn’t fight it.as he was ashamed to admit he had enjoyed this yesterday. Gently, she guided his head to her bosom, and gently he took a few tentative sucks at her teat. Then the milk began to flow. Rich and creamy, and better than yesterday, it came out of her and went into his mouth. Slowly, he suckled.<br />
<br />
“Good boy,” Hannah whispered and cooed as she petted the back of his head, gently stroking his hair. “You’re such a good eater. Yes you are! Yes you are!” Sam continued suckling on the sweet mothers milk, getting lost in the sensation.<br />
“Easy there, baby,” Hannah said. “Don’t get your tummy too full. We still gotta get some solids in you.” Just then there was a knocking at the door.<br />
<br />
It was Hayley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I&#39;m going to the mall,&quot; she said. She caught sight of the ring on her mothers finger. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a nice ring mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this thing,&quot; she pointed at the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can have it if you want sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave the ring to Hayley who put it on her finger. Perfect fit she thought.</p>
