<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric Anderson knew he was somewhere in the dark woods of Moon Lake forest late at night, chasing after prey in his werewolf fursona, but when and why remained unanswered questions as he felt his heart pound and his blood boil in the excitement of the hunt.<br />
There was a slight sliver of moonlight above the trees, trying its best to filter through the limbs to light the ground before him, but Eric was going by scent and pure lupine instinct.<br />
His quarry was just ahead, running as fast as it could, its tail swishing in relation to its movements attempting to keep ahead.<br />
Eric licked his muzzle in anticipation, for the hunt was almost over.<br />
Tensing leg muscles propelled the werewolf forward as sinewy arms wrapped themselves around Eric&#39;s prey.<br />
The two forms went down in a tangled mass of legs, arms, and...<br />
LAUGHTER?<br />
Eric looked down at the form pinned below his lupine body in disbelief, as the she-wolf Cassie O&#39;Sullivan looked up at him with a big smile on her muzzle.<br />
But this wasn&#39;t the <i>same</i> Cassie he had last seen hours earlier.<br />
This was an older Cassie, within the full bloom of her womanhood. Her breasts were nice and round, the nipples hard as her bosom heaved trying to catch her breath. Even covered in rich fur, no one could deny the luscious form of her shapely hips, round rear and well toned legs.<br />
And the scent coming from her body was quite... intoxicating!<br />
&quot;You caught me fair and square beloved,&quot; she said, smiling at him. &quot;So, what are you going to do with me Mister Anderson?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just this, Doctor Anderson,&quot; replied Eric, as he started kissing her while placing his quite erect and eager lupine red rocket deep within her moist and anxious pussy.<br />
Soon the two werewolves were meeting each others thrusts and urging their mates further into a rutting frenzy until howls of pleasure could be heard echoing through the woods as they enjoyed orgasmic bliss together.<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson sat upright in his bed, a cold sweat matting his fur as he felt something sticky. He looked down to see his nether regions covered in some kind of a white liquid as his young lupine penis was starting to retreat back into his sheath.<br />
<i>I had what they call a wet dream,</i> realized Eric. <i>My</i> very first<i> wet dream.* But about CASSIE? And why did I call her Doc—</i> and then Eric stopped, knowing what that meant.<br />
Not sure whether or not he wanted to think about that any more, Eric quickly went to the hall bathroom to take a shower and clean his fur before reverting back to his human form and getting dressed for the afternoon.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Come on stud. It&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t talked about all of this a hundred times before already,&quot; began Alex Ramsey, as he addressed his boyfriend Nate Anderson.<br />
Nate wasn&#39;t sure exactly where he was. Alex&#39;s bedroom perhaps? All he knew was that while they were both currently in their regular human forms, he had thought often of the handsome young werewolf since the night Alex ushered him into werewolf society, making all his dreams come true. But why was he hesitant about whatever they were discussing now? &quot;It&#39;s just that...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh man. I am a complete dummy! It&#39;s about your father!&quot; realized Alex. &quot;I&#39;m sorry he can&#39;t be there with us,&quot; he added, while laying Nate&#39;s head on his shoulder and holding him close. &quot;But he will always be with us in spirit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; was Nate&#39;s only reply, wishing Alex&#39;s actions would proceed on to more pleasurable things. But what were they discussing?<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; continued Alex, as he raised Nate&#39;s head up so they could look at each other face to face. &quot;When the time comes, what do you want. Do you want me to become Alexander Anderson, or do you do me the honor of becoming Nathaniel Ramsey?&quot;<br />
&quot;HUH?&quot; asked Nate, staring at him.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a simple question man. Who takes whose name when we get married?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate awoke in a start, but unlike Eric, there was no mess to clean up. Only annoyance that he doesn&#39;t get to find out how the dream turns out.<br />
Nate gave serious thought to rolling over and falling back to sleep in hopes of getting an answer, but the rumbling of his stomach said there were other concerns to address.<br />
Going from werewolf back to human and getting dressed, Nate staggered into the hallway, and saw Eric wrapped in just a towel coming out of the bathroom.<br />
&quot;Say Nate,&quot; began Eric, standing in the hallway kind of dripping from the shower, as he looked up at his big brother. &quot;Could you do me a favor?&quot;<br />
&quot;If I can. What?&quot; since their father&#39;s passing, the two brothers had actually grown closer than ever before. Whether that was because of the tragedy they shared, a joint concern for their mother, both now being werewolves, all or neither of the above or something else, neither knew or cared.<br />
&quot;Sometime when we&#39;re alone, when mom can&#39;t hear us, could you explain women to me?&quot; asked Eric sheepishly.<br />
<br />
DOWNSTAIRS...<br />
Martha Anderson had a fitful sleep on the living room sofa. Dreams of what her life with William still in it versus the reality of today filled her mind.<br />
She was fighting with her conscious. Was there more she could of or should of done during that final battle with Yvette Smith? Would her husband still be alive otherwise?<br />
Answers and peace were not forthcoming that afternoon as the Anderson family&#39;s doorbell rang.<br />
Martha got up, went to the peep hole, and saw...<br />

*AFTERWARD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES<br />
Within the Moon Lake of Earth-1 thread, Julie Stovall and Eric Anderson had multiple dreams about each other, erotic and otherwise, until they declared their love for each other and consummated their relationship as Eric became a were-merman in the process.<br />
It is my personal opinion that the tragic death of William Anderson which created the Moon Lake of Earth-3 thread broke this psychic link that was forming between the two, hence Eric&#39;s recent declarations that while Julie was his friend, their relationship had not progressed further (let alone to the point that they were sharing each others dreams), so Eric never actually felt anything truly serious towards her beyond friendship.—tmw.</p>
