<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff was left at the farm his dad returned home to find his wife <br />
in bed with his best friend James.<br />
<br />
The anger ran through his body so swiftly that before he knew it he <br />
had pulled up their profiles on the chronivac and began making changes <br />
to them. If he had a gun they would have been dead and he would be <br />
heading to the chair but he had this nice little toy and as he burst <br />
through the door of his bedroom he pressed enter.<br />
<br />
James jumped from the bed and his wife Dorthy pulled the sheets up <br />
around her naked body.<br />
<br />
James felt the changes go through his body. His chest pressed out <br />
giving him almost rounded tits. Still male they were large and <br />
bulbous. His hips rounded as if he were becoming more feminine. His <br />
hair filled in the male pattern baldness that would have become worse <br />
as he grew older. His penis shrank to an almost invisible stub but his <br />
balls grew to grapefruit sized melons. He had an oddly furry chest on <br />
these almost female tits and very hairy legs arms and face. He had <br />
given him an almost insatiable sexual appetite but he redirected his <br />
attentions from women to men making him a bottom due to his lack of <br />
penis size. He gave him a new job. He became one of the top drag <br />
queens in the state. And he would go to bed with anyone that showed <br />
him the slightest interest and many were not top of the line.<br />
<br />
James was constantly shaving due to his massive amounts of hair even <br />
requiring some touch up between shows. It took a very large penis to <br />
stimulate his prostate enough to get him to cum but when he did it was <br />
an orgasm that he would have never had before. Jeff's dad, Myron, had <br />
made it so that he remembered his former life and the reason he was in <br />
his new form but he gave him the belief that this was who he truly was <br />
and that his prior life was just a lie.<br />
<br />
His wife he froze in time and took her out to the farm where his son <br />
was now stabled. When he placed her in front of her son he unfroze her <br />
there. Jeff knew who it was but being a horse was unable to say a <br />
word. At this point Myron pressed submit and Jeff saw his mom shrink <br />
in size and become more rounded. Her nose became more stubby and she <br />
grew a tail. His mom was becoming a pig. The farmer put her in a pen <br />
outside near Jeff so that he could see his mom being bred with many <br />
boars. A litter of piglets soon came and Myron was delivered a full <br />
freezer of pork products ready for cooking.<br />
<br />
Myron became somewhat heavy, not that he was a lightweight before, but <br />
left to his own devices he no longer had to keep himself fit and trim. <br />
If he wanted someone to alleviate his stress he would just use the <br />
chronivac on someone and be relieved of his pressure. He found out <br />
that he was quite bi. Myron found himself going to James bar and <br />
watching his show bringing up the nastiest slimiest guy to use James <br />
that night.<br />
<br />
He even used his old friend from time to time making temporary <br />
adjustments to his own genitalia to ravage the asshole of the guy who <br />
took advantage of his wife and his good nature. But he would make it <br />
so that there was never enough stimulation to James for him to get any <br />
pleasure from Myron fcking him</p>
