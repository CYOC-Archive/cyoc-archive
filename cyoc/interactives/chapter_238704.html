<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    The trio headed back to the rest of the herd with Alex and Kyle leading the way Jack was stumbling occasionally as he got used to walking on four legs.<br />
The boys talked as they walked. Jack told them about his old home life and why he had run away. It had been a spur of the moment idea that had led to him becoming hopelessly lost before they found him. By the time they made it back Alex and Kyle had been able to formally introduce themselves to Jack. “ So do you two have sex often?” He blurted out quickly looking embarrassed. Kyle shrugged “ all the time everyone does you&#39;ll see when you meet them, sex and centaurs are hand in hoof, that reminds me we need to get cleaned up after we introduce you to Jericho there&#39;s a lake we use feels really good and it&#39;s hot” <br />
      The boys arrived at the clearing and found Jericho near the fire “ who&#39;s this?” He asked taking in the new centaur standing before him. Alex and Kyle flanked Jack and put their arms over his shoulders. “ This is Jack, we found him lost in the woods”. Jericho circled around examining every inch of the new centaur paying close attention to his sheath and balls “ and which one of you did the deed?” Alex raised his hand “ I did” Jericho faced Jake and stepped closer “ and who told you that you could add to my herd?” Alex looked nervously at Kyle who gave him a thumbs up “ Kyle said you allowed us to” Jericho stalked back and forth before breaking into a smile and hugging Alex “ and he&#39;s correct! You can add anyone to the herd as long as they consent to of course, we&#39;ll introduce him tonight at dinner. Welcome to the family Jack I hope you do enjoy yourself” <br />
     The boys took Jack to the lake slowly walking into the warm water feeling it cleanse their bodies, Alex walked in the water up to his shoulders closing his eyes as the hot water enveloped his body cleansing it. He wadded over to Jack who was chest deep splashing water on his face and hair “ this feels amazing! I felt so dirty being lost” he suddenly stopped and straightened up “how often do we umm…. Get erections?” Alex gently pulled him closer” we&#39;re teenage boys who are part horse, we get erections all the time. You can choose to ignore it or take care of it, the last one is better”. Kyle joined them kissing Alex and hugging Jack” it&#39;s almost dinner time we should head back” the boys headed towards shore as the water level decreased it revealed a trio of equine erections that the boys noticed each other&#39;s penises immediately “ looks like we all need some relief, how about after dinner I&#39;m starving”. They all agreed and together they joined the group for dinner.<br />
       The group greeted Jack immediately as they gathered around the fire for dinner. They warmly welcomed the newest member of the herd.  As Jack ate he became increasingly aware of the engorged equestrian equipment hanging between his legs, the swaying heavy balls adding to his arousal. He glanced around noticing that he shared the problem with several other centaurs and felt a little less awkward. Alex walked over his own penis fully erect and swinging with each step “ how is it?” Jack smiled “it&#39;s good I&#39;ve been starving since I left home I didn&#39;t bring anything with me”. Alex patted him on the shoulder “ eat your fill we have plenty of food, also as centaurs we need to eat way more than humans”. After finishing dinner the trio headed off making their way back to the lake.<br />
     They kept the tour going, showing Jack around and continuing to introduce him. As Jack walked along he couldn&#39;t help but notice his enormous newly formed testicles bouncing and swaying with each step. “ Do you ever get used to them moving around?” Alex and Kyle nodded “ yeah you do but you gotta admit it&#39;s awesome having a penis and balls this big I just wish I could actually touch mine”. They stopped by a small trail leading to a stream flowing off of the lake “ this is the” Kyle shrugged and looked awkwardly at Jake “ this is the bathroom for if you gotta go, just do your business in the water” Jake turned and started walking down the trail “ I really gotta go pee” he grinned looking slightly embarrassed “ I&#39;ve always been jealous about my brother being able to pee standing up now I get to see what it&#39;s like! And with a way bigger penis than him” Alex and Kyle waited off to the side of the trail “ I really want him to fuck me” Kyle flicked his tail” same here, let&#39;s drain him”. Jake returned smiling and looking more excited than earlier. “ That&#39;s awesome! All I had to do was stand there and go! By the way, we pee a lot. Alex and Kyle put their arms around Jake&#39;s shoulders and led him down the trail. “ we&#39;re going to our special place, it&#39;s secluded and we won&#39;t be bothered” Jake looked at the boys flanking him “ what are we gonna do?” Alex kissed his cheek without breaking stride “ formally introduce you into the world of centaurs, you wanna touch a penis again? We can make it happen, we might even be able to help you achieve the goal of holding a penis while peeing”. <br />
       It was dark when the boys made it to a small secluded clearing on the top of a hill, the full moon provided enough light for them to see. In the middle of the clearing there was an A-frame structure with padded supports and a shallow pit underneath “ what&#39;s that?* Jake asked suddenly nervous” Kyle walked over to the structure and reared up on his hind legs and rested his forelegs on the pads “ this is the structure we use for the regression ceremony by the way “ he shifted slightly causing his long erect penis to sway sending drops of pre spattering across the dirt. “ Regression ceremony?” Kyle flicked his tail “ yeah didn&#39;t you know? We have a regression ceremony at the age of 30 we regress to a colt about the same age as we are now. I&#39;ve done it myself twice, yeah I&#39;ve been a centaur for a while”. Alex stared at him, his mouth agape in awe, “ how old are you?” <br />
“ As a centaur? Or human? As a centaur I&#39;m 11 as a human 80 and a former girl so Jake i know what you&#39;re going through”. Alex stepped over and gently ran his hand down Kyle&#39;s erection causing the boy to moan softly “ wanna jerk me off before I go pee? If you do hurry up cause I gotta piss like a race horse” Jake joined them and started playing with the enormous testicles dangling below” With both boys playing with his equine equipment Kyle closed his eyes and moaned shuffling around his hind hoves digging small trenches into the soft dirt “ fuck I&#39;m close” Alex slowly licked the flared glans pushing his tongue into the piss hole teasing his partner, that&#39;s all it took to push Kyle over the edge. <br />
    A thick stream of hot cum erupted from his penis splattering across Alex&#39;s chest, Alex quickly deflected the stream covering Jakes stomach and fore legs before aiming the cum stream on the ground, cum kept coming and coming as Kyle&#39;s testicles emptied out spurred on by the boys who kept playing with them. The cum dribbled to a stop. Kyle rested on the structure breathing heavily as his penis slowly softened while strings of cum stretched between his glans and the ground. Alex and Jake smeared the cum across their stomachs and chests “ I really wanna try some” Kyle shook his head “ don&#39;t, if you consume it you&#39;ll regress again. You&#39;re already as young as we normally get but we can get younger”. Alex rubbed his fingers together smelling the cum, he drew his fingers across his forehead and down his nose leaving a shiny white trail “ if I can&#39;t swallow it I might as well play with it”. Kyle shifted slightly as his penis flopped limply, “ wanna hold it?” Jake turned and faced Kyle and eagerly grabbed his molted shaft “ I watched my brother peeing one time and thought it was so cool that he could aim” Kyle started peeing on the ground yellow piss foaming as it hit the ground with a loud splash” aim away bro” Jake aimed Kyle&#39;s penis between his legs and then his own hoves a smile spreading across his young face” this is so cool it&#39;s like a hose”. Kyle emptied his bladder and Jake released his penis stepping back while Kyle dismounted the structure. “ Who&#39;s next?”</p>
