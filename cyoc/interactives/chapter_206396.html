<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jared enters his home, he is unaware that Dave is going to call the Zoo to get them to send someone to Jared’s address to pick up the “Tiger” and take it to where it originally belongs.<br />
<br />
After dropping the rest of the kids off at their school, Dave takes out his phone and dials the number of the local Zoo.<br />
<br />
“Good morning,” a cheerful female voice answers, “my name is Anabelle, how may I be of service?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, good morning,” Dave says, “I am calling to inform you, that a young white Tiger is on the loose. Someone seemed to have used the Chronivac on the poor thing, it thinks it is a human boy named “Jared”, it walks and talks like a human and acts like a confused and scared child. The person, who changed the young cub, seemed to have forgotten to transform it into a human, or forgot to activate the reality alteration.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” the woman on the other end says, “I have heard about that device, it really is scary and powerful. Poor cub, of course I’ll send someone over, we can help it return to what it really is. We own a Chronivac, which we use to help the animals, just tell me the address and someone will be on his way ASAP!”<br />
<br />
Dave gives Anabelle the address, he then asks, “how will you get him to come with you?”<br />
<br />
“Our guy will figure something out,” Anabelle says, “if treating it like a child does not work, he’ll use his gun to fire a dart which is filled with a strong anesthetic drug that is designed for wild animals like tigers. The drug will send the young cub into a deep sleep for a few hours.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good,” Dave says, “please tell your guy to not scare it, since it thinks it’s a human kid. He should approach it as such, talk to it in a calm and kind voice, I’d also suggest to not bring a gun, that might terrify the poor animal. Oh, and it would be better to not notify the media, we don’t need the city to fall into chaos.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we’ll keep everything in the dark,” the woman says, “and as for our guy: he’ll find a way to not come over as a threat. Depending on the circumstances, our guy will adjust: if there is an open window, he’ll use his blow pipe to shoot the dart at the Tiger, if he must ring the doorbell and have the Tiger open it, he’ll talk calmly to it and have the dart in his hand. When the cub is distracted, he’ll poke the dart into the Tiger’s bum. The drug works instantly, and the cub will fall asleep straight away.”<br />
<br />
Happy with the explanation, Dave says thanks and hangs up the phone, ‘I hope everything goes well for the little guy,’ he thinks to himself as he drives off, ‘poor little fella, but he’ll soon be back where he belongs.’<br />
<br />
Jared, meanwhile, is lying on his bed, his room is located on the first floor, the window to his room is open, to let some cool air come in. The boy, himself is asleep, there are noticeable red rings around his eyes from crying so much, out of confusion and fear. While he sleeps, still dressed in his school uniform, Jared does not hear the sound of a Van approaching and stopping in front of his house.<br />
<br />
The Van is completely white, no logo or other markings are to be seen, the driver’s door opens and a man, wearing a white shirt and blue Jeans, steps out and looks up at the house. “So, this is where the Tiger is supposed to be,” he mumbles to himself, “first, I’ll check the windows,” so he walks up to the house. The man walks around the house, checking every window, all are closed except for one on the first floor, ‘hm… if I can find a ladder, I’d be able to climb in,’ he thinks to himself, ‘no one will notice, since the window is on the back of the house and no other house is facing it.’<br />
<br />
The man searches the back yard for a ladder, he soon finds one behind the shed, he grabs it and carefully, not to make any loud sounds, leans it against the wall of the house, directly underneath Jared’s window. The man, who’s name is “James Hilton”, starts to climb the ladder, he is a young man around 30 years old with short brown hair and green eyes, his skin has a light tone. When James reaches the window, he slowly and carefully peeks inside to see the “Tiger” seemingly sleeping on a bed. James silently climbs through the window and tip-toes quietly up to the sleeping figure, ‘what a beautiful cub,’ he thinks to himself, like everyone else, he does not see a human boy, he sees a white Tiger with fur, a muzzle, tail, hands and feet with long sharp claws, and all the other features a big cat has, except that this “cat” has been changed to walk, think, act and talk like a human. The man shakes his head, ‘who would do such a mean thing to such a majestic creature,’ he asks himself, ‘that person should be punished,’ James takes out the sleeping-dart, but as he is about to poke the “Tiger” with it, the “animal” starts to stir and let out a groan. Thinking quickly, James hurries over to the closet, which he noticed was open when he entered the room. Just as James closes the door of the closet, leaving just a slight crack to peek through, the Tiger sits up and rubs its eyes.<br />
<br />
Jared, unaware of the danger he is in, sits up on the edge of his bed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. The boy looks around his room, he then lowers his head, “I still don’t get what is going on,” he mumbles, “why did everyone, including my friends, suddenly think that I am some sort of Tiger? I am not a Tiger, I am a human, I always have been and always will be.” Jared lets out a sigh and gets up from his bed, he starts to head for the door of his room, when suddenly he feels a sharp pain in his butt, “OUCH! What the he…,” he starts to say before his eyes roll back into his head and he collapses on the ground with a loud thump.<br />
<br />
Once the “Tiger” has collapsed, James exits the closet and walks up to the “animal”, he kneels down and pulls out the dart of Jared’s butt, which he had shot at him with a bamboo-blow-tube. James then turns the “cub” onto its back and checks for any injury after the hard fall, the man sighs in relief, when he sees that the “cub” only has a small bump on its head. “That went better than expected, he’ll be out four at least five hours, maybe even more,” he says to himself, “let’s get the little guy out of here and back to safety.” James picks up the “Tiger Cub” and carries him to the front door, he does not take the clothes of off the &quot;Cub&quot;, leaving that to the Vet, or whoever takes on the poor &quot;animal&quot;, he then opens the front door and checks to see if the coast is clear, before heading to his Van. He opens the back, where there is a empty cage waiting, and puts the young Tiger into it, he then hurriedly jumps into the driver’s seat and starts to drive back to the Zoo. While driving, James tries to make sense of the whole thing, one: why would someone treat an animal like this, two: what else could the Chronivac and especially the person using it do and most importantly three: where in the world did the person get their hands on a white Tiger? Did they kidnap it from a Circus or a other Zoo, or did they buy it off of the black market? Well no matter, James did his job and now the cub is safe from any further harm. The only thing now is to try and help the poor thing and decide what to do with it: keep it at the Zoo? Send it to a sanctuary? Or try to release the young cub back into the wild, hoping it’ll be adopted and accepted by a pride. But those decisions aren’t James’s job, that is the job of the Zoo’s boss, James just hopes that the cub will find some loving home.</p>
