<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry lay there underneath Alicia for several minutes and felt the penis in him grow limp and begin to slip out. It got to the point where he no longer felt filled he gently pushed Alicia off and she rolled over onto the bed beside him. Wrapped her arm over him, gave him a kiss and said “That was unbelievable” <br />
<br />
“Um, Do you think? You could, um, use your fingers or something?”<br />
<br />
Alicia realised straight away what was wrong “Oh shit! I’m so sorry! I got carried away! I didn’t think! I’ve left you unsatisfied”<br />
<br />
“It’s alright. I understand how it is” It wasn’t alright.<br />
<br />
“Do you have any pill’s I could take? I want to please you”<br />
<br />
“We wouldn’t have time. The one I have don’t work instantly. It doesn’t matter. You should be rejuvenated by tonight. I’ll get another chance” <br />
<br />
“Stay here. I’ll be back”<br />
<br />
Henry stayed on the bed. He pulled the bedsheet over himself. He felt guilty now. He should have just stayed silent, now they would both feel bad. He should have faked it. Did Alicia sometimes fake it? Now wasn’t the time to ask. He heard a tap running in the bathroom or was that the shower? <br />
<br />
Alicia did shower. She not only wanted to wash her dick clean she also wanted to wake up. She now knew why Henry and her former male lovers often fell asleep after sex. She was spent, but hopefully the shower would wake her up. She felt terribly guilty that she had been premature. It wasn’t how she had planned.<br />
<br />
She tried to get some life back into her penis but it was shrivelled and spent. That wasn’t going to work.<br />
<br />
Her other alternative was to stimulate Henry manually. She knew where to touch with her fingers but to be honest that felt so ho hum. It would just be like masturbating herself.<br />
<br />
Using her tongue was the more exciting option but there was something holding her back. She knew what it was. She had never thought of herself as a lesbian but using her tongue on Henry would be crossing that line. She had given oral many times to her lovers, Henry included and actually enjoyed the taste of semen but she had never licked a pussy. That’s what dykes did. <br />
<br />
But she did so want to please Henry. It wouldn’t make her a lesbian. Henry was her husband. He liked eating her out and he certainly wasn’t a lesbian. No doubt his pussy would be filled with the semen she had just injected into him, surely that would mask the pussy juices? It would taste just like giving head. That’s how she would think about it. She was just going to give her husband head in a sort of reversed way! She dried herself off and felt a twitch in her groin. Perhaps there was a bit of life in Mister Marvellous after all? Not a lot but a good portent for the future.<br />
<br />
Alicia returned to the bedroom, still naked. Henry was awake just lying there. He had pulled the sheet up over himself. She moved over to the window and closed the blackout blinds then closed the door. It was now quite dark in the room. <br />
<br />
Alicia found the end of the bed and pulled the sheet away so she had access to Henry’s feet. She was silent. Gently she massed his feet then his shins. Thanks to his shaving only an hour or so ago they were smooth, but she knew these were the same hairy legs of Henry’s that she had massaged many times before.  She gently worked her way up his legs to his thighs. She had often started a hand-job or a head-job with such a massage. She wanted to keep Henry guessing about what he was shortly to receive. He certainly wasn’t objecting.<br />
<br />
Alicia’s hands moved further up. The top of Henry’s thigh was sticky. Clearly he was leaking. Alicia wasn’t stopped. Her fingers finally reached what were now Henry’s neatly trimmed pubes. She gently traced her fingers over the vaginal lips. They were gooey and open to her touch. Alicia had examined her own vagina after sex and didn’t find the look very attractive. She knew Henry’s sex must now look exactly like that. She paused realising her mouth was dry. The opposite of the vagina she was about to dive into. <br />
<br />
That was a good approximation of the situation she was in. It was like she was wading into a cold swimming pool knowing she had to dive in. Once she was under the water everything would feel fine but here she was shivering in anticipation of how cold that first submergence would feel.<br />
<br />
Henry was still silent. Alicia was aware her hands had stopped massaging him, or was that more correctly her? Once more she touched the moist pussy lips then located Henry’s semi engorged clitoris. Then she dove in.<br />
<br />
As Henry sensed Alicia dive between his legs he breathed with relief. That was what he was hoping she would do. When he first felt her tongue lick his newly acquired vulva he had to stifle a groan of relief. However after 30 seconds as he felt her tongue dart in and out of him he could no longer stay still. He felt himself squirming. She seemed to be rotating between licking his upper thighs licking inside of him and licking the magical little lump. Henry gently pressed Alicia’s head into his energised groin.<br />
<br />
Alicia’s first task was to clean up the semen from Henry’s groin area. This was a task she was familiar with and once she got going she relished licking up the salty goo. Initially the vagina also tasted exactly like Henry’s semen but as she cleaned it out the taste changed. Clearly Henry was secreting his own juices and they were diluting the semen. The more her tongue felt the little nub of Henry’s clitoris the stronger the taste became of the juices Henry’s vagina was producing. To her surprise Alicia was starting to enjoy this foreign seasoning. <br />
With Henry’s thighs now cleaned Alicia concentrated more of her effort on Henry’s honeypot. She felt Henry’s hand hold her head in place and his little cunny began to buck. She once more moved to the clitoris and could literally feel the pulsations as Henry enjoyed his first female orgasm. That made Alicia not want to stop. She began licking more aggressively and Henry began to moan. She only stopped when Henry wiggled backwards in the bed and gasped “Enough”<br />
<br />
After a cuddle Alicia recommended to Henry that he might enjoy a bath. She stayed on the bed to enjoy what she considered a well deserved snooze.</p>
