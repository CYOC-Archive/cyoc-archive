<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Linda Michaels was in a fit, a lot of her men had either been taken down by Fukushu, or most likely were arrested and in handcuffs at the moment by S.P.E.A.R.. She had tried to radio Seraphim, but that was proving useless as she didn&#39;t respond. She would have no choice but to go there herself. Only a few men remained inside the control room including herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am, either S.P.E.A.R. or Fukushu is likely to come after us, what are your or....?&quot; A man at the control desk asked before getting shot in the head by Linda.<br />
<br />
The man sitting next to the gun shot man was shocked and held up his hands in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t understand, we&#39;ve been faithful to you, why are you killing us?&quot; The man asked trying not to cry before getting shot in the head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting mine and Ezekiel&#39;s family out of here and away from all of this. I will protect our family no matter who gets in my way.&quot; Linda determinedly said as she made her way out of the control room before shooting at the machines making sure S.P.E.A.R. and no one else could use any valuable information they kept.<br />
<br />
As Linda made her way through the warehouse, she saw plenty of her own soldiers who had been massacred by Fukushu, but paid them no mind, her only goal was to get Eliza, Lilith, and Alyssa away from all of this. Voices could be heard not far away as she rounded the corner and saw several Superior Church soldiers fighting members of S.P.E.A.R. Linda tried to make herself invisible to them, but one agent happened to see her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Linda Michaels! Stop right where you are!&quot; The woman, Alexa, shouted at her as she gave chase. Linda obviously didn&#39;t stop and shot at the woman.<br />
<br />
Alexa managed to quickly dodge Linda&#39;s bullets as she changed into her Nekomata form and gave chase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Echo team, incapacitate and arrest these guys, I&#39;ll catch back up with you!&quot; Alexa shouted to her team as she chased after Linda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa? Alexa, wait! God damn it, wait!&quot; Tom called back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, I&#39;ll be fine, just trust me!&quot; Alexa called back to him as Tom used his ferrokinetic powers to get at least three men out of his way.<br />
<br />
The warehouse that Linda had chosen wasn&#39;t in the best condition for her Superior Church operation, but it had to be done as Fukushu and the others had been looking for them, so several areas hadn&#39;t been finished or worked on in years with equipment such as rusty rods sticking up out of the ground.<br />
<br />
Tom could just barely make Alexa and Linda out as he chased after them, areas of the warehouse were starting to weaken as he ran after them, slowing him down. A broken electrical wire nearly got him as he got around it, several pipes had fallen on the ground that Linda had likely pushed to slow Alexa down, but now Tom was having more trouble getting around them as he got ever closer to Alexa and Linda.<br />
<br />
Alexa chased after Linda as she ran up steps of the warehouse to a long catwalk that was a little unstable. Alexa thought this woman was nothing more than a woman with a big idea on her mind and began to fight her, but discovered that this woman was quite formidable at her old age. She deflected and blocked her attacks as well as giving Alexa a few good hits to the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a demon hunter for years and trained by my love Ezekiel Kane himself you pussy! Did you think I was just some old woman who stood around here scratching her ass all day?! I&#39;m Ezekiel Kane&#39;s TRUE DISCIPLE!!&quot; Linda shouted at Alexa, her eyes full of anger and hatred towards Alexa as she fought hard against Linda.<br />
<br />
Tom finally made his way up the rickety old warehouse catwalk as Tom held out his gun towards Linda Michaels.<br />
<br />
&quot;Linda Michaels, it&#39;s over! By the order and authorization of S.P.E.A.R., you are under arrest! Now drop your gun and surrender!&quot; Tom ordered as he walked closer to the two of them, carefully holding his ground on the catwalk.<br />
<br />
Linda looked like she was giving up as she lowered her gun, and noticed Alexa turn to smile at Tom and nod giving her approval. Linda could see that this human man favored this cat woman and was disgusted as she raised her gun back up quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;DEMON LOVING TRAITOR!&quot; Linda shouted as she aimed her gun to fire at Tom, but Alexa quickly grabbed Linda&#39;s arm wrestling it away from Linda and pointing it up in the air as she fired a shot and Linda wrestled her over the ledge of the catwalk.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALEXA!&quot; Tom shouted as he ran as fast as he could towards the pair who were dangling over the rickety catwalk.<br />
<br />
Linda had a better grasp of the catwalk, but Alexa did not and Linda used this to her advantage and began kicking at Alexa&#39;s hands to loosen her grip. Alexa tried to hold on as tightly as she could, but her grip was starting to weaken, even with her claw fingernails. Unfortunately, the bar on the catwalk finally snapped and broke off and Alexa began to fall while Linda sneered and managed to climb back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!!!&quot; Tom shouted as he ran to the spot where Alexa had been.<br />
<br />
As Alexa fell, the world seemed to slow down around her and memories were now going through her eyes.<br />
<br />
********************************************************<br />
&quot;Pleasure to meet you Agent Harris.&quot; Alexa said shaking Tom&#39;s hand for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay partner?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just get a bit nervous when I go out into the field,&quot; she blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Alexa,&quot; Tom grinned. &quot;I got your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
*************************************************<br />
<br />
Tom used his ferrokinetic powers like a liquid arm and stretched it towards Alexa as she continued to slowly drop.<br />
<br />
******************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever opened up to anyone like that before. Is it a nekomata ability or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alexa chuckled in confusion. &quot;But my folks said I was always very empathetic. They thought I should&#39;ve been a psychologist.&quot;<br />
<br />
**************************************<br />
<br />
Alexa could see the worry in Tom&#39;s sweet face as she gazed back up at him and his ferrokinetic arm was coming ever closer to her.<br />
<br />
*****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, a cat joke?&quot; Tom said flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m proud of it,&quot; Alexa smiled. &quot;Just trying to lighten the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
******************************************<br />
<br />
Alexa had only known Tom for so many months, but he had been the best thing that had ever come into her life as small tears now came out of her eyes.<br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
The memory came back to her of the two of them making out in the medical lab. It was one of the best times of her life.<br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
The memory of the barbecue now came to her mind as she was having a good time and meeting all of Tom&#39;s eccentric members.<br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that. I hope it wasn&#39;t awkward.&quot; Tom apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, honestly, it&#39;s great seeing what a wonderful family you have. I can&#39;t wait to be part of it.&quot; Alexa said giving Tom a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
**********************************************<br />
<br />
Then she thought about when she mistakenly thought Tom was about to propose to her and the two had a slight laugh about it.<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa... did....did you want to get married?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO,&quot; Alexa said quickly, her face flushing in embarrassment. &quot;I mean yes! I mean...I don&#39;t know...someday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too Alexa,&quot; Tom answered, running his hand through the woman&#39;s brunette hair. &quot;With all my heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
*************************************************<br />
<br />
Alexa could see Tom&#39;s ferrokinetic arm coming ever closer towards her, but she could also sense that something was coming up behind her, but wasn&#39;t sure what it was. As she looked back up at Tom, she suddenly saw a man standing next to Tom who was bald headed and in a suit. Tom didn&#39;t see the man, but Alexa did and recognized who it was right away as she took a deep breath, she thought of a world with herself, Tom, and the family she would never have now.<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s ferrokinetic arm just barely grabbed Alexa at the same time as the back of her head slammed against a metal rod sticking out of the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALEXA!&quot; Tom shouted as he used his other ferrokinetic arm to lower himself down to the ground and gently placed Alexa on the floor away from the rods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey? Hey, Alexa, wake up. I saved you, right? I just saved you and caught you.&quot; Tom said almost in disbelief as Alexa&#39;s eyes remained closed and she didn&#39;t respond to Tom at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa? P-P-Please, say something....&quot; Tom begged as he held Alexa&#39;s head and saw blood on the palm of his hand where he had been holding it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god no, Alexa. Please, please, don&#39;t leave me.....please, don&#39;t leave me.....god.....please don&#39;t leave me.....Alexa, you were my entire world....&quot; Tom said as he began crying uncontrollably and cradled Alexa&#39;s head close to his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa.....&quot; Tom quietly said weeping through his tears as he held her body close to his.</p>
