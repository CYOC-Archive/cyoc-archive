<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kathy lived on a farm with her dad. They had many farm animals there. One was very special; an anthromorphic chicken. The anthro chicken was not only an egg layer but forced to work there too. She was owned by Kathy&#39;s dad as was all the other animals there. Kathy was about 8 years old when she realized something was off about the anthro chicken. She didn&#39;t appear to want to be there. Kathy&#39;s dad also threatened her multiple times that if she didn&#39;t do her work & obey they&#39;d turn her into dinner. Though it was legal to do that to the anthromorphic chicken sense she was not a human but an animal it didn&#39;t feel right. One day Kathy took the anthromorphic chicken in to play with. The chicken revealed through writing on paper with a pencil (she was incapable of speaking; just chicken sounds) that she never wanted to be an anthromorphic chicken. Never wanted to be owned by Kathy&#39;s father. Never wanted to be just thought of as an animal. The fact she was kidnapped & forcefully transformed into an anthromorphic chicken & sold as livestock. Kathy shocked told her dad all of this. Her dad&#39;s reply was that &quot;That chicken is my property. She isn&#39;t a person. She&#39;s just an animal.&quot; It seemed clear to Kathy that her dad didn&#39;t care. Kathy told the police about what the anthromorphic chicken told her (through writing) but they didn&#39;t believe her. Soon after that Kathy was sent off to live with her aunt. It would be 20 years later before she&#39;d be able to do anything for the anthromorphic chicken. Her dad had passed & he left the farm to her in his will. She made it clear all she wanted was the anthromorphic chicken. So she got it. The anthromorphic chicken arrived at her house in a large cage; but not big enough for her to stand up. Kathy let the anthromorphic chicken out & told her she was the kid from all those years ago; & she wanted to help her. The anthro chicken was hesitant at first but quickly realized who Kathy was. Kathy took the chicken to the local Transformation Center to try & get them to turn her back into a human. They were informed that was impossible. Kathy told them the anthromorphic chicken never wanted to be as she is. After some talk & writing (the chicken wrote) & scanning a few things were discovered. There was no code for the anthromorphic chicken. All transformed have a code in their DNA, She didn&#39;t. This confirmed the story they told him. The employee had never come across this before. He called corporate & told them the story. Though shocked their was nothing they could do. They informed the employee to do whatever he has to fix this. And they promised to look more into this alarming incident. Not defeated & wanting to do anything to help the anthromorphic chicken to make up for the hell she&#39;s got through asked a simple question. &quot;Can you transform me into vocal cords for her? So she can be able to speak human again.&quot; The employee answered &quot;Yes. But she would have your voice. And becoming that you&#39;d have no control over what she says ever. And you wouldn&#39;t be a person anymore. You&#39;d from then on only be a part of her.&quot; The chicken was shocked & wrote &#39;You can&#39;t do that.&#39; Kathy replied placing a hand on the side of the chicken&#39;s feathery head &quot;I want to try & right what was done to you.&quot; The chicken wrote &#39;But I will still have no rights. I&#39;m classified as only an animal. Owned by you.&#39; Kathy looked at the employee & asked &quot;Can you record that I was transformed into an anthromorphic chicken? That she is me?&quot; The employee nervous replied &quot;They did say do whatever to fix this. So I guess yes.&quot; The chicken wrote more shocked &#39;You can&#39;t be serious?&#39; Kathy put a hand on her yellow scaled hand saying &quot;It will give you rights again. And I don&#39;t have any friends or family left so no one will realize you&#39;re not me.&quot; The chicken thought about that & wrote &#39;Thank you for this.&#39; The employee asked &quot;When you want to do this?&quot; Kathy answered &quot;Right now.&quot; The employee went &quot;Ok.&quot; The employee left & came back a minute later with a syringe. He told Kathy what it was & how it worked & the two what to do. He then injected Kathy in the arm with it. It was to work in 5 minutes so Kathy stripped completely naked. The employee lead them to a &#39;Changing Room&#39;. Kathy already was feeling the effects of the serum as they got to the room. Kathy & the anthro chicken entered the room together as Kathy began to shrink as all her body hair vanished. Kathy quickly told the chicken important things about her while she still could. Soon Kathy was small enough to fit in the chicken&#39;s beak. The chicken picked Kathy up & popped her in her mouth & swallowed. Kathy slid down the chicken&#39;s throat some intill she reached where the vocal cords were. She hugged them wrapping her arms & legs around them. Her body then began to melt & merge with them changing them. Soon Kathy was gone having become the chicken&#39;s new vocal cords. The chicken tested out her new vocal cords & was surprised & delighted she could say words again. The chicken left the room & headed back. The employee asked if it was all done & the chicken confirmed by saying &quot;Yes it is.&quot; The employee said &quot;Good.&quot; pleased as the chicken asked in a whisper getting close &quot;Did you record me as Kathy Sdam?&quot; The employee answered this with &quot;Yes Miss Kathy Sdam.&quot; Pleased the anthromorphic chicken asked &quot;Where&#39;s my clothes?&quot; The employee asked / informed &quot;You can&#39;t wear them. They won&#39;t fit your body now. And being an animal you don&#39;t even need to wear anything.&quot; The chicken told him &quot;I want to.&quot; The employee asked curious &quot;Why?&quot; The chicken whispered &quot;I been forced to be naked for over 20 years. I want to wear clothes again.&quot; The employee getting it got her &#39;Kathy&#39;s&#39; clothes. The anthromorphic chicken took them & left with a &quot;Thanks.&quot; She headed right for a clothing store & told the employee there she wanted to buy some clothes to wear. The employee told her that the only thing she could wear now were dresses; but no bra or panties. And no shoes or socks; on the account of her avian feet. She said fine with that &quot;Fine.&quot; Some time passed & she now had & paid for 3 dresses & a purse. She left the store wearing one of her new dresses & touched her throat thinking thankful & happy [Thanks for getting the ability of speech back to me Kathy by becoming my vocal cords. And thank you for giving me your identity to me so I can be free to do what I want. I will honor your gifts by living.] The anthromorphic chicken looked herself over again loving the dress she now wore said happy &quot;You look good Kathy Sdam.&quot; <br />
She was already enjoying the gifts Kathy had given her. <br />
Kathy herself was totally aware & everything & very happy she&#39;d help this poor chicken. She forced herself to sleep in a far back place in the anthromorphic chicken&#39;s mind. She would never awake again because she didn&#39;t want to. The anthromorphic chicken was now Kathy Sdam as far as anyone knew. And she was happy. Kathy was happy about that.<br />
The End.</p>
