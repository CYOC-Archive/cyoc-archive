<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author’s note: Only futas get pregnant, since women have the front of their torso replaced with a functioning urinal made of flesh. Their entire anatomy is altered to function as a urinal. They can still eat food, but only small amounts due to having very small stomachs. Their main food source is piss and cum, which, once passing through the sphincter-like flesh drain at the bottom of their bowl, continues on and passes through a tube of flesh which extends from where the opening to the vagina would be and reenters the body between the anus and vagina. This muscular tube leads to the intestines, merging with the stomach contents for digestion. The process is highly efficient, and leaves behind only a black sludge rather than feces, which is expelled through the anus. Any moisture is drawn out and sent to the water reservoir, which is mounted on the back, similar to the reservoir on a conventional toilet, complete with a lid of flesh that can be flipped up to allow access to the reservoir, which is opened and closed with extra muscles in the upper back. They also only have one lung, in order to make room for the digestive system and other organs. At the top of the toilet bowl, between the breasts, there is a huge penile shaft which has its head embedded between the breasts. The urethra extends through the sternum, above the heart, and into the reservoir. The reservoir is entirely filled with diluted vaginal fluid rather than water. In order to flush a woman, one must stimulate her penis until she reaches orgasm, which causes juices to flow from the reservoir, down through the shaft, and out through holes in the top of the bowl. <br />
<br />
Marinova &#321;ukowski is a 21 year old woman born to Polish and Bulgarian parents in Queens, NYC. She ran away from home when she was in high school due to her highly conservative family and her sexuality being at odds. She has albinism, with white hair and vibrant pink irises. Also she has H-cups.<br />
<br />
Hestía Finnborg is a 19 year old trans woman from Iceland, who met her girlfriend in college, at which point she had been transitioning for two years. She has a twin sister named Karolina, who is also her roommate. She and her sister have orange hair and aqua eyes.<br />
<br />
Chapter 1:<br />
<br />
When Marinova Lukowski awoke, everything felt a little bit off. She felt short of breath, for one thing, and her stomach felt odd, and there was some kind of moisture on an area she couldn’t quite place. She reached down and tried to feel her stomach, but her hand was met with nothing but air. She felt around, discovering a warm, concave, and highly sensitive expanse, which had a layer of liquid in the bottom. Something was very wrong indeed. She sat up in bed, took one look at what had become of her body, and screamed. In place of her stomach, a concave bowl shape made of flesh and bone. Sticking up from this is what appeared to be an enormous, veiny penis, but it curved and seemed to enter her chest between her breasts. Her breasts themselves were resting on the flat upper rim of her bowl. She felt a strange weight on her back, and feeling around she felt a sort of growth on her back, made from cartilage, which she could feel was filled with some kind of liquid. Looking down past her breasts, she saw the full extent of her strange anatomy. The bottom of the bowl had a flexing sphincter which she could somehow flex with muscles she didn’t even know she had. Her “drain” was ever so slightly raised, leaving a thin layer of sticky fluid in the bottom of her bowl. She ran her hand along the sides in disbelief, reaching down and feeling her vagina. Where the opening should’ve been, there was a fleshy tube which looped back and entered between her vagina and anus. The tube was highly sensitive and grabbing it felt bizarre. <br />
<br />
Hestía Finnborg awoke to the sound of her girlfriend shrieking in terror. Last night had been wonderful, and she was still sore from the huge horsecock strap-on her girlfriend had used on her anus. But something was off. She felt sore in more than one hole. And the weight on her chest was far greater than she was used to. She sat up in bed, immediately greeted by a pair of absurdly huge P-cup breasts. Past these, an equally absurd 21 inch cock and grapefruit sized testicles. She felt underneath and sure enough, she now had a vagina. She felt amazing. But then she looked at what had become of her girlfriend and her mood quickly soured. The whole front of her body looked like a urinal made out of flesh and bone and body parts, and Hestía could see tears in the poor girl’s eyes. She hugged her girlfriend, her breasts pressing against the penile shaft between her boobs. The stimulation was enough to cause a bit of pussy juice to trickle down her bowl and join the pool at the bottom. <br />
<br />
Just then, Hestia’s twin sister and roommate  Karolina flung open the door. She appeared to have the exact same condition as Mari. “Hey bro, you gonna take a leak? Cause I’m parched!”<br />
<br />
The two just stared in disbelief. “What the fuck is wrong with you, LOOK AT US!”<br />
<br />
Lina squinted, then shrugged. “Seems normal to me! Still my two little lovebirds, same as always! So what’d you two get up to last night, anyways?”<br />
<br />
The two looked on in horror, and Karolina’s playful expression quickly drained from her face. “Ok, what’s going on, something’s off with you two.” <br />
<br />
The couple proceeded to explain every single detail they could recall about the world they came from, and Lina listened with rapt attention. She interjected at times, not fully comprehending the idea of a world without people who function as human urinals. <br />
<br />
“How does being a urinal even work? How do I get pregnant? And why do I feel so out of breath?” <br />
<br />
“Don’t be ridiculous, women can’t have children! Only men can have children! And the reason you feel that way is probably because in your reality, women have two lungs like men do, instead of just one.”<br />
<br />
Karolina pulled out her laptop and looked up a diagram of female anatomy to show the two. <br />
<br />
Marinova felt dizzy, staring down at the concave bowl set into her torso, imagining her girlfriend using her as a toilet, cumming or even pissing into her. She locked eyes with her girlfriend, who looked equally mortified by the fact that, for all they knew, they were stuck in this bizarre universe, with no way to get home.</p>
