<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha quietly went about some basic housework, greatly relieved that William had been supportive on the idea of going back to work. A job hunt might be a bit difficult, but she figured that she could manage. Her housework was to make sure that things were clean, given that Nate would be having his official induction. A part of her found herself chuckling at all the ironies that had come in their moving to Moon Lake. A few days ago, when Samantha Twist had given them the information about Moon Lake and its were-beast population, she had William had been against and didn&#39;t even want to stay in Moon Lake. Nate had been the only one that had been interested. Yet, she and William became were-beasts before Nate did. That vixen attacked William and he became a werefox and she spent the night with Samantha and Frances and became a werecat, and both of them had come to enjoy their new condition. William&#39;s only &quot;dislike&quot; about his condition was that he didn&#39;t get a choice, not that he was a were-beast now.<br />
<br />
She also found herself thinking about Eric. Eric was still human and hadn&#39;t expressed any desire to change, and he would soon find himself with a family of weres living with him, and Martha had to admit to herself that she had only just kept herself from jumping William when he lost his towel when the werevixen called them. It&#39;d mean that with her raised libido combined with William&#39;s own high libido, if transforming didn&#39;t raise it further, that the two of them could very really find themselves mating at the slightest act. She also knew that if the Pride had meetings at their house, she could also find herself with Samantha and Frances again at the werecat event. She wasn&#39;t going to just go next door because she was horny, but she was truly finding herself more comfortable with her sexuality and she wasn&#39;t going to be celibate either. All of this could mean that Eric might see her or William in their were forms and might be frightened, and given Nate&#39;s fascination with werewolves, he&#39;d probably also change as much as he could, which would mean that Eric would also see his brother in his transformed form and might be afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will and I may need to change for Eric and show him we love him and won&#39;t hurt him,&quot; Martha though to herself as she finished sweeping up in the kitchen, and figuring to maybe get a start on a special dinner to celebrate Nate&#39;s induction and invite the Twists over as well to let Nate be with his friend in Ben  and to give William the chance to at least try to apologize to Samantha.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts however, were interrupted when there came a ringing from the doorbell. She glanced at the oven clock and then wondered who could be at the door. Nate or Eric would come right in, and given her induction with the Twists, she figured Samantha or Frances would do the same. However, with William still cleaning the gutters, based on the soft metal clanging she heard echoing through the house, she shrugged and set aside the broom before walking around to answer the door. The guests she found surprised her even more. <br />
<br />
Flanked by six men in dark business suits was a lone woman, and the scent of fox rapidly reached Martha&#39;s nostrils. All of them looked to be of Japanese ancestry, but the woman seemed to carry an air of leadership and &quot;power&quot; about her, though Martha also though she looked old. It wasn&#39;t old in the way she or William had looked before their transformations or old the way her own parents looked. Her black hair looked long, but was tied back and had very dignified gray/silver streaks in places. In fact it did look like her hair was going gray. Her age lines and wrinkles were small and barely noticeable, and her overall musculature and build looked remarkably healthy. She wore a bright red woman&#39;s business suit jacket with a mid-cut white business shirt underneath it that covered a very impressive bust line, that Martha found herself slightly envious of and borderline curious about, even with a slight sag to the covered breasts. This female werefox also wore a knee length red skirt with white stockings and red heals that went with the suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Konichiwa,&quot; the woman spoke politely and calmly giving a few inquiring sniffs, and then spoke again, with a rather heavy Japanese accident, &quot;I am Tachibana no Akane, Royal Leader of the Skulk in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha only blinked at this and looked to the other werefoxes, &quot;and they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My retainers, and grandsons,&quot; Akane gave a very proud smile, and then introduced them. Martha watched as each bowed as his name was spoke. &quot;I will give you their first names as they are all of my Clan. Yamato, Daisuke, Ichiro, Yoshiro, Taro, and Sora.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t Sora a girl&#39;s name?&quot; Martha asked, not very familiar with Japanese culture.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be either,&quot; Akane answered with a smile, &quot;If your are curious as to why their names are not... English... I did not move to Moon Lake until 1946... to get away from the poverty and mistakes that had lead the children of the Sun to war with people of Lincoln.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no problems with Japanese names, Mrs. Akane,&quot; Martha told her, &quot;I&#39;m just a bit curious as to the visit...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... well, first, Akane is my first name,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;we in Japan give our last name first in formal introductions, and as for why I am here... I would think you should know that already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha blinked for a moment and then remembered vixen&#39;s call in the morning. She had mentioned being in trouble and that the Skulk&#39;s rules would demand William defend her. William essentially told her to get lost. If Akane Tachibana was the leader of the Skulk, that&#39;d mean she was hear for William.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not here to take William, are you?&quot; Martha asked suspiciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to talk with him,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;as Yvette Elizabeth Smith  and her foolish actions broke Moon Lake&#39;s laws, forced an unwilling transformation, and who knows WHAT else... at least that is what the police informed me with regard to the attack and the young Vixen&#39;s arrest. As for your apparent concern for me seducing your husband, that is silly. I am bonded and am waiting to join my mate in the next life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Waiting...&quot; Martha said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was incinerated when the bomb went off over Hiroshima,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;and his loss was partially why I moved from Japan to America. I am of a noble family, but am a very MINOR member of that family... and the war left us poor. Moon Lake was to be a new start. I came here with my sons, who were thankfully in Tokyo with me when my Osamu died. We established our Skulk... and found that many women saw a great deal of benefit in joining... often to attract either a male werefox&#39;s attention or to seduce some boy they already had a crush on and feared wouldn&#39;t love them as they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha guessed that people decided to become werefoxes for the sexual enhancements. Part of her even wondered if that was a reason anyone became a were-beast. She was already a C cup when she and William started dating and after lactating during her pregnancies with Nate and then Eric, her own bosom had grown slightly and she wore either a CC or D cup, depending on the make and model of the bra. Now as a werecat, her breasts, even in human form, were not only bigger but firmer as well. Easily a DD or a small E, depending on the make and model, though she also admitted that she&#39;d need to buy some new bras and underwear as the pair she was wearing under her sweatpants and tee shirt were a bit tight and Samantha and Frances didn&#39;t loan her their own clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;We established good businesses in real estate and the law and have developed a lot of Moon Lake,&quot; Akane continued, &quot;as I wait my time to move on and rejoin Osamu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me... but if he died... wouldn&#39;t you have the right to marry again?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
Akane gave a laugh that actually reminded Martha of her older sister when she had tried to explain feminine hygiene when Martha had started puberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Legally... yes,&quot; Akane gave a laugh, &quot;but a werefox&#39;s bond to his or her mate is firm and unbreakable. If you wish... research the stories of Kitsune, which we werefoxes probably inspired, in Japanese culture. They can be tricksters, yes, but not blatantly evil and in many of the stories of human/kitsune parings, the matches are quite romantic for both sides. The kitsune is loving and dutiful... until exposure is threatened and the kitsune is forced to flee... We are loving and devoted to those we bond to. And my bond is to Osamu. The fox in him will wait for me and the fox in me will not stray.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha told me that werefoxes are rather loose with their sexuality...&quot; Martha found herself blurting, as she was trying to prove Samantha&#39;s theory that William was a jerk with no redeemable qualities and her own fears that the fox in him would be the same as the man he was before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only while we are looking for who we will bond with,&quot; Akane&#39;s smile immediately disappeared, &quot;that young cat, despite all the good she&#39;s done as the Town Chancellor, knows NOTHING about werefoxes or our behavior beyond what is in the town&#39;s handbook... much of which was written by a werebear in 1888 who felt bothered at having to talk with the first werefoxes that moved here and record information on a new were species moving to Moon Lake... Once a werefox has a bond with someone... that bond is unbreakable and and the fox will have eyes and nose only for the one he or she is bonded to. Even those who have had trouble with those issues have found that the fox in them will overpower any bad marital habits easily. In my two hundred years, I have seen it all before. Ms. Twist has only observed werefoxes in the dating stage of courtship in which no firm commitment is made until they are sure the bond either has or is forming... and has judged all werefoxes accordingly. I have observed that in her behavior as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha could only blink, and was about to defend Samantha&#39;s honor when Akane finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;That said... I do think her a noble woman for her commitment to her wife  and the work she&#39;s done for Moon Lake,&quot; Akane finished, &quot;She could stand to control her temper a bit and do some real research on those who are not werecats or werewolves... but then... there are many good people that could stand to learn that sort of lesson. So do not think I think her &quot;bad...&quot; In fact I&#39;ve voted for her... twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha only blinked again as Akane straightened her dress and sniffed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I am here to welcome William Anderson to the Skulk and provide him with any help he may need in understanding our own culture within Moon Lake and the rules that are required of all weres, since Yvette Elizabeth Smith didn&#39;t bother to do so and will be expelled from the Skulk in addition to whatever legal punishment the city will take,&quot; Akane answered and sniffed again, &quot;has William bonded to you since your transformation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Martha asked, as she and William hadn&#39;t had sex with each other as were-beasts, though she admitted a part of her certainly wanted to earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;His scent is on your hands as a fox and his scent before he was a fox is on the rest of you,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;Has he bonded with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He says he has,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;he&#39;s cleaning the gutters right now. I can get him for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;Please be quick. The police and the mayor&#39;s office did tell me when they notified me of Yvette Reynaud&#39;s actions that your son is going through the more formal induction tonight and I do not wish to take up too much of your time in welcoming you and William to the Skulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a werecat,&quot; Martha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I can smell that,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;but if William has bonded to you... you are to be part of my Skulk as an honorary member in addition to being part of Ms. Twists small Pride.&quot;</p>
