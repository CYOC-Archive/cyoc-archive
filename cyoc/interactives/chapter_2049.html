<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott pried up the middle key, as it was the one he saw first.  He knew he didn't have much time left, as Tim's head was already brushing his chest.  He shuffled himself forward to the chest, and felt his cock push Tim over.  'Oops,' he thought looking down, 'no time to worry about that now.'  At the rate Scott was shrinking, he knew he was only going to get one try.
<br />

<br />
He could feel Tim moving against the fur covering his muscular body -- probably trying to avoid being squished -- as he pulled the &quot;shrink&quot; key out and slid the middle key in.  Pushing the buttons, that key went with the &quot;man&quot; button.  'Probably a good sign,' Scott thought as he opened the lid with a little more than a foot of size left.
<br />

<br />
As he peered in, there was a sudden flash, causing Scott to slam the lid down before any of the explosion reached Tim, below.  He stumbled backwards, unable to see anything and tripped on Tim, causing them both to fall over, Tim's face landing in Scott's crotch.
<br />

<br />
During all this uncomfortable shuffling around, Tim had been trying to get out of Scott's way, at least a little.  When Scott had first thrust his two-foot dick into Tim, his intentions had not been entirely clear to the smaller man.  After all, his first reaction to this situation from Tim's point of view had been to spring a boner and start jacking off.  So, as Scott had continued moving around, Tim tried to stay out from under foot, but had started to avail himself of the opportunity to touch the biggest cock of his life.  Landing face-first into Scott's lemon-sized testicles was not entirely unwelcome.
<br />

<br />
Tim recovered first, and put both hands on Scott's foot-long dick.  It had stopped receeding.  &quot;Hey, I think you've stopped...&quot; Tim said and then trailed off.
<br />

<br />
Scott, still a perfectly respectable giant at 12 feet tall, leaned up on both elbows to look at Tim's hands on his boner.  Scott wasn't really gay, but a hand-job was a hand-job... and that's when he saw his dick stretching out to meet him. Tim had been growing since the first time Scott saw him on the table, and that hadn't changed, but now his dick was growing too in Tim's hands.  &quot;Tim, my dick!&quot; Scott said.  &quot;It's growing now that you're holding it.&quot;  Quickly, and a little roughly, Scott grabbed Tim by the arms and lifted him forward to clamp both small arms around his chest.
<br />

<br />
Tim hugged Scott's firm, hairy body and buried his face in the muscular ravine between his pecs.  He and felt it slipping away immediately, and looked up at Scott's broad moustache.  They looked into each others eyes as Scott shrank to 9 feet.  His theory dashed, Scott grabbed for his genitals, &quot;But my dick,&quot; he said, &quot;my balls...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Tim rolled off to one side as they both saw Scott's sex appeared to be frozen at the size it had been during the flash.  From Scott's point of view, it was growing now, and quickly.  To Tim, it had simply stopped shrinking at one foot in length.
<br />

<br />
Scott was starting to masturbate again as his cock extended and broadened in his hands.  With the other hand, he squeezed his balls as they swelled.  He looked over at Tim, &quot;Come on Tim, help me,&quot; he said, now no bigger than any other day.  &quot;My dick stopped shrinking.  We've got to be on to something here.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Tim thought about it while he watched Scott pass below his own height of five-something -- &quot;five INCHES and something&quot;, he reminded himself with a look at the chest.  Scott was still shrinking, and as odd as it seemed, Tim couldn't think of anything better to do.  Crawling over on all fours, he put his face into Scott's crotch and started licking the big balls he found there.
<br />

<br />
Scott was beating off with all his might, but his dick seemed like it was already 18 inches long to him, and the bigger it got, the less stimulation his hands could give.  He tried hugging his dick to his chest and rubbing it with his hairy muscles, and that was a lot better.  Soon, his cockhead was poking up to his neck and he leaned over to lick and kiss the tip.  Before long, his dick was poking up past his face and out of reach.  &quot;Tim,&quot; he said quietly.  As Tim moved, Scott was alarmed at how small he had become.
<br />

<br />
Tim leaned back and looked at Scott.  The little man had shrunk so much that the giant dick now reached past his head.  Scott didn't need to say anything else.  Tim maneuvered his own hands and face to the tip of Scott's rod and started sucking on it.  His own erection jabed at Scott's soft flesh, and Tim felt Scott's little hands close around it.  Sucking Scott's dick was a serious endeavor, as the tip was almost as big as Tim's fist.  Tim looked down at Scott as he felt the small hands shrinking quickly against his own hot skin.
<br />

<br />
At last, there was a change as Tim felt Scott's balls starting to contract.  The baggy flesh now stretched to Scott's knees, and Scott's dick threatened to grow as big around as his chest.  There were a few little spasm, and then Tim heard Scott's small voice let out a moan.  Tim got his head out of the way as he could hear the jizz shooting up Scott's shaft.
<br />

<br />
Tim pointed Scott's dick away, and they both watched as an amazing fountain of cum came pouring out.  Tim got a good show, but not as good at Scott's, as Scott had shrunk so small that Tim's dick was coming up on six feet in stature.  Scott's entire body shook as his own mammoth cock -- twelve of his shrunken feet in length -- unloaded gallons of cum from the huge balls that pushed his legs to each side.</p>
