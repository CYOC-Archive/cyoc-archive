<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kissing her new husband on the forehead, Eve laid down next to him and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Paul was the first to wake up in the morning, when it was still dark. Turning the bedside lamp on, he got up, <br />
took his underwear off, and basked in the temporary freedom of nudity before his new wife woke up. Oh sure, <br />
they were married now, but some things just never change. Paul was still shy around girls, even long after he <br />
grew up and got married, afraid they would laugh at him or something. Despite Eve's protestations that she <br />
loved him for just the way he was(though she didn't deny the benefits of a proper diet, regular exercise, and <br />
whatever supplements you may take, if any, if you should be so inclined either), Paul just couldn't get over <br />
the fact that such a frankly hot girl like her would want to share her life with a schmuck like him. But that <br />
was kismet. Besides Timmy, Paul had never met a person he was such kindred spirits with, a person that he <br />
could share everything with. It was beyond being lovers and beyond being friends. It might have something in <br />
common with the Australian idiom &quot;mateship&quot;, if mateship's were co-ed that is. Honestly, Paul felt like the <br />
luckiest guy in the world, and as he went about his morning routine, he periodically glanced over at his <br />
sleeping bride Eve, as angelic a person as could be found. <br />
<br />
When she woke up a few hours later, she stayed in bed but immediately made her presence known.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey. I-. Oh my lord, this is going to sound crazy, but I think I was Tim Sherman in a past life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Timmy?&quot; asked Paul, who was playing a video game. He turned it off, seeing the seriousness in Eve's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, although I think my past self got really annoyed when you called him that. Just before we got married <br />
yesterday, a sudden influx of information about Tim's old life enveloped my mind. It's still there, Paul. I <br />
can tell you literally anything you want about Tim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...um, so how did you come to the conclusion that you were Timmy before you were born? Seems kind of <br />
weird to talk about reincarnation when the person you're saying you were is still alive&quot; observed a slightly <br />
amused Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I'm glad you asked, because now it gets even weirder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weirder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I believe that Tim's body is currently being inhabited by the soul of an elderly woman who's supposed to <br />
dead right now named Evelyn Campbell. I think her soul is in Tim's body, and that my soul used to be Tim's&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul looked into Eve's eyes to see if she was joking or still drunk from the reception last night. She wasn't, <br />
as far as he could tell.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're serious.&quot; It was rhetorical. He knew Eve was telling him what she honestly believed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm completely serious. Serious as a heart attack. I've never felt anything like tjat before! It was <br />
just literally as the priest asked me to take my vow to be your lawfully wedded wife. All these memories just <br />
came flooding through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you thought this whole theory through just now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I've been thinking about it all night, Paul. Running through my mind all of the possibilities. I had no <br />
idea you were into black magic until now. Oh, my little Paul the D&amp;D nerd, who just couldn't get enough and <br />
had to try the real thing.&quot; Eve started giggling in that sweet, bubblegum voice of hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;All...right&quot; murmured Paul. Internally, he was wondering how to go about this. He never told anyone about <br />
this, even his own family, but Paul was a practicing sorcerer. Despite his background in the hard sciences, <br />
Paul never gave up his curiosity about the fantastic, and of course, given his geekiness, he had tried to <br />
discover the link between where natural phenomena ended and magic began, or even if there was a separation at <br />
all. Eve had no idea about what Paul did in his spare time, and until now, she didn't need too. But she was as <br />
skeptical as they came, so having her just out of the blue claim that she was reincarnated from anyone, let <br />
alone a living person, not to mention her hypothesis that Tim had the &quot;wrong&quot; soul his inside his body, left <br />
Paul room for pause. Thinking back to his teenage years when he was first involved in the occult, he couldn't <br />
recall any of his spells going badly. Uncle Edmund had confirmed that Paul indeed would be a talented sorcerer <br />
if he just kept up at it, which he did. And Edmund was very sad and disappointed when Timmy flat out expressed <br />
his disinterest in the magical arts. Maybe Edmund did something to Timmy in the interim between then and now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve, I think we're going to have to visit my Uncle Edmund. He can help us confirm whether your story is true <br />
or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about Tim? It's very important that we let him...or her, once he realizes that he's Evelyn Campbell, <br />
know about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can get to that later. We have to take it easy and slow, Eve. Not everyone is as logical and composed as <br />
you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks sweety. But who's the irrational one- Evelyn or Tim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If an Evelyn exists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I KNOW she does, Paul. I was her for a brief period.&quot;</p>
