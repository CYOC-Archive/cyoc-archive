<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The still of the night was broken by a flash of motion.  Twin streaks flew across the field, one black as midnight the other golden like the mid-day sun.  The creatures chased each other around the field – stalking one another, and then charging headlong at them.  A nip here with sharp fangs was followed by a tug from a clawed paw.  Finally they fell together and basked in the moonlight.  Twin sets of amber eyes gazed deeply at the moon for a few moments before locking again on the eyes of the other – their mate.<br />
<br />
The she wolves howled in unison.  Their duet bonded them to the other in a profound and inexplicable manner.  As the song reached its crescendo, rough tongues jutted out to meet the other and lick at a furry muzzle.  Clawed hands pulled them to each other as they rolled to the ground.  Rough padded hands found one pair of nipples in a furry ruff, then another set beneath them, and then a third below that.<br />
<br />
To each, an overwhelming scent overcame sensitive nostrils – a scent of arousal, a scent of pleasure.  One turned about the other and soon, each had a snout buried in the furry sex their partner bringing forth even deeper and stronger howls of pleasure.  Release upon release brought satisfaction and exhaustion and the majestic creatures lay together in a blissful haze.<br />
<br />
Then, at the edge of the clearing, a twig snapped.  Pointed ears perked in response and their haunting eyes scanned the distance for their prey.  Finding the scent familiar, the dark one curled her lip in growl and jumped to her feet.  She was off in an instant.  The golden one joined the hunt and followed her lover into the night.<br />
<br />
Jack had spent the next few hours at the concert making every attempt to drown his sorrows.  His intoxication had only served to embolden him when approaching those women he deemed to be unaccompanied.  However, his definition of that term was rather loose – meaning a woman who was not presently in direct physical contact with a man.  He had made several blatant passes at young women who were standing next to their boyfriend.  He had narrowly escaped being pummeled by one them on no less than three occasions.  His obvious drunkenness was the only thing that dissuaded any of them from putting him out of their misery.<br />
<br />
When the booths selling alcohol had closed for the night, Jack stumbled down the path.  In his beer addled mind, he remembered that there was a cooler full of beer back at his campsite.  He tripped along the path toward his goal.<br />
<br />
“Fucking, cock tease!” he shouted, “God-damned fucking BITCH!”<br />
<br />
“Hey,” someone called from inside a tent at a nearby campsite, “keep it down out there, we’re trying to sleep!”<br />
<br />
Jack was undeterred.  He continued to rant and curse as he headed down the path.  He turned to continue his tirade and walked backwards along the path, still shouting, “Yeah, go ahead and sleep.  This place sucks!  Nothing but a bunch of assholes and cunts here anyway!”<br />
<br />
Jack failed to notice that he had missed the turn to his campsite as he unleashed his backpedaling insult.  He turned and stumbled into the forest, traveling deeper and deeper into it with every step.  <br />
<br />
It was over a half hour later that realized he had gone too far.  He cursed and began to make his way back.<br />
<br />
As he walked back, Jack didn’t notice the creature stalking him.  She moved along off the trail.  Waiting, biding her time, knowing she would know when the time was right.<br />
<br />
Then he sensed something.  He got an uneasy feeling that he was being watched.  He stopped and turned abruptly, but he could see nothing in the dark underbrush.  He took a few more tentative steps.  Then he heard it, a rustling in the leaves behind him to the right.  His pounding heart rushed a heavy dose of adrenaline into his system, bringing a modicum of sobriety with it.  He froze in fear and turned slowing toward the sound.<br />
<br />
Again, he saw nothing as he peered into the forest, but he strained his eyes because every sense in his very being told him something was there.  <br />
<br />
Then he saw them, and his blood ran cold.  A pair of bright, predatory eyes bore down on him.  There was a low growl.<br />
<br />
Jack didn’t wait for more.  He turned and began to run with all his might.  He jumped when he heard the howl behind him as the hunt was joined.  Jack scrambled along the path, then sensing that it was turning away from his destination, he abandoned it and dove headlong into the brush.  His face and limbs were assaulted by any number of branches and bushes.  His clothes were torn as he ran and screamed.  He couldn’t bear to look, but he knew he was being pursued, and the beast that was chasing him was gaining on him too.  His feet slipped out from him as he encountered an unanticipated hill.  His foot turned inward, and he heard a cracking sound.  His next step was met with immeasurable pain as his momentum forced his weight onto his broken ankle.  Falling to the ground, he slid ten feet before he lost all control and rolled to the bottom.  Dazed, Jack scrambled to get up.<br />
<br />
He never did.<br />
<br />
The massive creature, nearly eight feet tall, lifted him into the air and smashed him against a nearby tree.  His back snapped from the collision.  He tried to pull himself backward, dragging his useless body with his hands as he whimpered with fright.<br />
<br />
She was toying with him now.  In the dim predawn light, Jack could make out her shape, her dark coat of fur and those menacing, amber eyes.    She growled again as she crept closer to her target, smelling the fear on him.<br />
<br />
Then she leapt, claws bared and mouth open.  He screamed until her jaws snapped around his throat.  She crushed his windpipe and pulled backward, savoring the coppery taste of his blood as it washed down her throat.  Holding him by the neck, the beast rose to her full height and held him above her as he gasped for air through his ruined throat.  Then she threw him to ground.  His skull crashed into a rock and split apart.  He was unconscious as her clawed hand plunged into his chest and pulled out his heart.<br />
<br />
A loud strong howl pierced the night air.  A howl of victory and vindication.<br />
<br />
From the hill above, three more creatures, her sisters looked on.  They did not join her in her cry but instead offered a mournful call of sadness and regret.</p>
