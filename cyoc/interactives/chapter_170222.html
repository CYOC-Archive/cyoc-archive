<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m not playing your stupid game Kyle. Please. DO NOT. Call me again. Okay? A-Buh-bye.&quot; Jen tried to hang up the phone, or even end the call, but her body refused to listen. &quot;Well, that was quite something to say as your last final words as a normal person. But anyways, you get both because rrrrriiiight, NOW! you have officially run out if time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen wanted to do anything to just end the conversation, but it was like her body was frozen. Nothing. Jen could do exactly nothing. Not even blink. She wasn&#39;t even breathing, but for some reason, that didn&#39;t seem to be an issue. The only thing that worked like nornal was her hearing. In fact it was the one thing that had actually improved, as she could now hear Kyle as if he was speaking directly into her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lest start with the transformation. Jen, you are going to have a perfectly trained body, and not in the athletic sense, though I am sure your body&#39;s physical capability will also go way up. No, what I meqn by trained, is that your body will be a flawlessly trained body of a sex slave. It will act as a sex slave would in any situation, even if against your will. <br />
<br />
But you must be wondering what I mean by sex slave? Well Jen, this includes being unquestionably obedient to me, serving me out of your own volition, even if unnecessary, unless I tell you otherwise, and a handfull of a few, let&#39;s say, special features. I wont tell you all of them, but for example, you will unfailingly achieve orgasm whenever you hear a countdown reaches 0, on 0, if it started at 3 or higher. That should make it interesting at school today, watching you orgasm at least 2 times durring the homeroom alone, let alone the rest of the school day. You better hope someone doesn&#39;t realize the correlation. The only other thing is that your body will completely adapt itself as needed in order to follow my commands, even if it normally wouldn&#39;t be possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was starting to get nervous. She didnt believe in the curse, but the fact that she couldn&#39;t move a muscle, blink, or even feel her own heart beating, had made her begin to rethink her stance. And if it was real, then her life may now be completely fucked. <br />
<br />
If it was real, then she would be reduced to just being a sex slave, with Kyle as her master, for what she assumed to be for the rest of her life. Not only that, but she would have a body that moved independently of her will if her &quot;training&quot; dictated a specific response. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now for the dare. Jen. I think I will keep it simple though. From this point on, I dare you to slowly fall in love with me, while forgetting this conversation ever happened unless I say otherwise. And that you will seek out a new master or mistress whenever I am not available for an extrnded time, for example, if I were to die somehow before you, you would find a new master or mistress to serve. And you will do it without even being concious about it. I also want you to forget this about this conversation once end this conversation. Lastly, I want you to curse the person I name after this dare, and give them the same curse, but leave out the last part about passing it on. Neither of you will remember getting cursed or in your case using it. Instead of passing along the same curse, dare them to use the curse on me, and to only say the following words when issuing it:<br />
---<br />
Transform or Dare Kyle. For your transformation, your body will be able to have multiple orgasms, and never tire of having sex. Even if satisfied, you could keep going if you wanted to. No one will stop you, reguardless of the situation too. You can even alter your own body and anyone elses in order to suit your own needs and desires. For your dare, I dare you to legally become both mine and Jen&#39;s owner, and also our master/mistress.<br />
---<br />
Alright Jen, thats it. See you in school. The person is your best friend Mia. I&#39;m hanging up in 3. 2. 1. 0 *click*.<br />
<br />
The moment the call ended was right when Kyle said 0. Jen immediately forgot everything said just then, as her body suddenly shook, as she suddenly came in her panties from an orgasm she didn&#39;t expect. Jen was extremely confused. Why had she suddenly cum? She wasn&#39;t even masturbating, let alone even turned on at the moment. There was no build up what so ever too. It just was that suddenly her body had become overwhelmed by such an intense amount of pleasure, clthat it caused her to immediately cum from orgasming.<br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t even have time to clean herself, as the bus was nearly here. Jen managed to find her sock, but slipped her other one off her foot, and put both into her bag, opting for a pair of black, 5&quot; stilletto pumps she had bought for a costume party a few months ago, instead of the usual sneakers she wore for cheerleading. She had gone as a slutty secretary, so the heels were a bit sexier than usual. <br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t even empty her panties which were still full of her unusually thicker cum. She reached into her panties and collected a bit on her fingers to inspect it. She brought her cum covered hand up to her face to properly see it. For one thing, it smelled pretty good, almost having a strawberry/peach aroma, which was not her normal. She licked it, and sure enough, it tasted exactly like her normal cum, but she found that she now liked the taste way more than she usually did. It was just so odd. Her cum was normally rather watery, but this time, it was similar to a runny syrup in terms of viscosity. &quot;Odd, maybe I need to drink more water&quot; said Jen to herself, sticking the cum back into her panties before she ran outside as best she could in her heels to catch the bus.</p>
