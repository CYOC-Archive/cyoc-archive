<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the trick-or-treaters gone for now, (and possibly making other kids’ costumes ‘more realistic’ along the way, Rosa hoped,) the kitsune was eager to resume spreading the changes around to the rest of the partygoers.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t mind taking you up on that offer for a kiss!”  A guy in a lion fursuit said, stepping up to Rosa.<br />
<br />
“Dude!”  A guy with a snake-like “fur” suit hissed sharply at the lion.  “Subtlety? Ya heard of it?”<br />
<br />
Another guy, this one in a cheap-looking, store bought goat costume, spoke up.  “She literally asked if people were up for it earlier, though.”<br />
<br />
Being able to see the face of the guy in the goat costume, Rosa recognized it as Ethan, who she’d shared chemistry classes with.  And that could only mean the other two fursuiters were his younger brother, Robert in the snake suit, if she was making out the voices correctly, and Corey,  the oldest, in the lion suit.  The three siblings went everywhere together, even if it wasn’t always a place ALL of them wanted to be, (and judging by Ethan’s costume, he probably was a lot less into the whole furry theme this party had than the other two).<br />
<br />
‘Too bad for him,’ Rosa thought, ‘but he’ll come around soon enough, whether he wants to or not.’<br />
<br />
The combination of costumes in front of her got the wheels in Rosa’s head turning.  And she HAD already asked if anyone was willing to line up for kisses.  <br />
<br />
“Now now boys, I don’t want to see another fight break out,” she said, her tails gently reaching behind each of the brothers and pulling them closer, her earlier hypnotic spell keeping all of them from questioning how her “costume” was so articulate.  “I can share a little kiss with each of you.”<br />
<br />
James growled slightly from the sidelines, but decided not to make a scene of this.<br />
<br />
With a quick shove from her tail, Rosa pushed Ethan’s mouth to hers.  He blushed a hazy smile appearing on his face.  “I… er… thanks?”<br />
<br />
“I’m next!”  Corey stepped forward on his own, and lifting the fursuit’s head to reveal a wide smile.<br />
<br />
“Of course, of course,” Rosa assured him, leaning in and giving him a short kiss as well.  He blushed just like his brother had, Rosa’s kiss enchanting their minds to muddy them further while their change proceeded, reducing their resistance all the more.<br />
<br />
She could tell from his posture that Robert was rolling his eyes in his suit.  A pity he didn’t seem as taken with her beauty.  Maybe if she shape-shifted into something reptilian… but no, she’d likely be forced to hide her true form for a while once the party was over, no need to put on a disguise so soon.  With another shove from her tail, Robert’s face was brought up to hers.<br />
<br />
“Hey!”  Robert spat, “I didn’t say I wanted in on-” he couldn’t finish before Rosa had already kissed his costume’s snout.<br />
<br />
Rosa grinned.  “Your loss if you don’t want to take the mask off then, but I wouldn’t feel right leaving you out of this.  You’ll be needed to bring up the rear.”<br />
<br />
James cleared his throat loudly.  “Are you done, Rosa?”<br />
<br />
“Until someone else takes my offer,” Rosa slipped back to the dragon’s side.  “We wouldn’t want anyone else to have to miss out on the fun, would we?  Or maybe the others would prefer arm wrestling with you.”<br />
<br />
Robert felt a slight chill as he stepped away from Rosa.  Not that he was complaining, the suit didn’t have much air circulation, so he’d take whatever cool breezes he could get-<br />
<br />
‘Wait a minute!’  Robert had always been the ancy type, his focus all over the place, picking up tons of little details faster than he could consciously process them.  Perhaps this lack of focus had hindered Rosa’s hypnotic suggestion, perhaps he was awakening to the mythical being he was becoming faster than his brothers, granting him resistance to her spell sooner, but whatever the case, he suddenly felt the urge to check his suit for holes, rather than simply assume nothing was wrong, and everything was fine, as had been suggested.<br />
<br />
He reached for the back of his suit, and, rather than finding a hole, or even a zipper, only felt cool, scaly skin.  He twtiched, suddenly feeling his body slowly filling into the increasingly realistic tail behind him.  Not only that, his legs were starting to feel weaker.<br />
<br />
‘I… am I becoming my costume?’  He thought.  ‘How on earth is this happening?  I have to-’<br />
<br />
<I>Join my brotherss,</I> a voice in his mind continued, only just barely distinguishable from his own with a slight hiss.<br />
<br />
‘Join my brothers, they’ll be able to help me figure out what to do.’<br />
<br />
He stumbled over to his brothers, grabbing their shoulders for support, his legs feeling weaker, and his jaws stretching out to fill the mask in front of him, fusing with it.  He felt two of hs teeth stretching out, folding back in his closed mouth, while his tongue split at the tip, scents all around him growing stronger.  <br />
<br />
Corey and Ethan meanwhile, barely seemed to notice their brother’s grip, or the growing heat from their own bodies merging with their suits.  <br />
<br />
Robert felt his legs finally giving out, but managed to prop himself up on his tail.  “Guys!  Guys?”  He gasped as he saw fur growing on Ethan’s face, and the horns fusing into his skull, while Corey’s tail began to move on its own.  “Guys, what’s wrong with you?  Something weird’s happening to us!  We’ve gotta-”<br />
<br />
<I>“Get together.”</I><br />
<br />
“-Get together and figure out a way to stop-”<br />
<br />
<I>Ever being separated again.</I><br />
<br />
<br />
“Ever being separated again.”  He continued.  Of course.  They were brothers, they should always be close.<br />
<br />
Corey and Ethan nodded slowly.  “I got you, Rob,” Corey said.<br />
<br />
“We’re gonna work together, and everything will be just fine,” Ethan continued, the two stepping closer together, making it hard for Rob to keep holding onto them.  Especially once the two began to join together, Corey’s lion body seeming to almost ooze over and absorb Ethan’s goat form, save for the lower set of hooves, replacing Corey’s paws, and the head, which grew in alongside Corey’s. <br />
<br />
Robert’s eyes went wide, but neither of his brothers seemed to notice anything was wrong at all.  He tried to wriggle his tail, and see if he could slither away, only to suddenly realize that he could feel the end of it merging if with Corey’s own tail.  <br />
<br />
He shook like mad, to no effect, as his arms began to wither away, his tail replacing Corey’s right down to the base of their spines.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be happening!”  Robert cried out.  “I’m-”<br />
<br />
<I>Becoming part of a whole.</I><br />
<br />
“Becoming part of a whole,” Robert realized out loud, his voice calming down.  “We’re-”<br />
<br />
<I>A family.</i><br />
<br />
“-A family, and we-”<br />
<br />
<I>Are one.</i><br />
<br />
“Are one.  We’re-”<br />
<br />
<I>Cor.<br />
Rob.<br />
Han.<br />
<br />
Corobhan.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
“-Corobhan.”  All three mouths of the Chimera said as they came to, no longer caring about the fact that they weren’t humans.<br />
<br />
Rosa laughed softly.  Eleven mythical anthros now.  Or did this one technically bring the count to thirteen?  Either way, they definitely outnumbered the measly seven humans left at the party.<br />
<br />
When Fanya had exactly ditched her clothes and had begun to go around wearing just the golden collar with her Monkey King, being just as naked as he was with his golden crown, no one could exactly be sure. But no one exactly noticed.<br />
<br />
But rather than disappear into nothingness, they&#39;d been deposited neatly in a corner of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like a soda sir?&quot; Asked the Nekomata of the Chimera. All three heads turned. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take one,&quot; said the goat-head, taking a drink from the serving tray the Nekomata had found and begun to chug it. Contrary to popular belief, goats could not in fact disgest tin cans, but then again, Han was not really a mundane goat. Munch much. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re being a maid, you outta be dressed like this, this is a COSTUME party after all!&quot; The Lion head said, apparently missing the memo the chimera itself was no longer wearing a costume. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you command,&quot; the nekomata said, finding Fanya&#39;s clothes using her own magic changed into a maid uniform, minus the shoes, and the hair cloth became a headband. She went to the Monkey King and his cat queen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Care for a drink Sir?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. And if you&#39;re a maid, you should use &#39;master&#39;, not &#39;sir&#39;,&quot; said the monkey king, thinking of those maid cafes. Fanya nodded in agreement, not thinking about how they&#39;d both been made clean slates by Rosa, she was a queen after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master, I shall obey, I am a maid,&quot; she bowed.<br />
<br />
 Next she circled around to Brad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Care for a drink Master?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks, but &#39;Master&#39; is for objects and property, remember that,&quot; the firebird said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master,&quot; she replied. &#39;I am an object, I am property.&#39; <br />
<br />
The doorbell rang, this time she answered it, she was a maid after all, it was her duty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trick-or-treat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Outside was a woman dressed as a witch, and the girl as a pink and white magical-princess-kitty-ballerina.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Treat,&quot; the maid said, giving the girl candy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks nice lady!&quot; The child said as they left with their parent, glowing pink sparkles actually trailing behind her as the girl&#39;s motions suddenly became a lot more elegant. <br />
<br />
&#39;I am a lady, I am nice,&#39; thought the nekomata, taking on a more proper poise. As she began to ponder, the raw material in her emptied soul beginning to brew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me Mistress,&quot; she asked the sphinx. &quot;I am a maid, I am an object and property, I am nice, and I am a lady...  What am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds to me you are a dolly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes Mistress, I an Dolly,&quot; Dolly responded. <br />
<br />
  Three fur lined up to challenge James to his arm wrestling match. A wolf, a fox, and a husky. <br />
<br />
James had a make-shift table set-up, eager to show off his strength and spread the gift to the three of the remaining humans. And James remembered his basic Greek mythology that he could guess what these three would become... well, that or a werewolf and that two-headed dog that he couldn&#39;t remember the name of right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady&#39;s first?&quot; The boys turned to see the woman in the cow costume who had pointed out James&#39; muscles had to be &#39;part of the costume&#39; before. She&#39;d chosen her costume not as any message, she was just sick of seeing foxes, wolves, and cats EVERYWHERE, and maybe bunnies. And had chosen a cow just because she knew few would have guts to wear one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you Venessa,&quot; James said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s so adorable, you think you could accidentally hurt me,&quot; Venessa said grinning under her mask.<br />
<br />
James short flames, and slammed his elbow on the table. &quot;Come on!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t going to win,&quot; Rosa said sweetly to Venessa seemingly out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be the judge of that hanger-on!&quot; She retorted, placing her own elbow on the table, and grasping James&#39; claw, feeling something like a static shock followed by a tingle spread over her body, but she ignored it. She might have been a furry, but she was also a weight lifter.<br />
<br />
There was no declaration to begin, both simply started! Venessa startled and almost lost when James proved to be stronger than she expected. &#39;Guess it isn&#39;t just a costume after all!&#39; <br />
<br />
Venessa rejected defeat, and began to push back against the insane amount of strength James had. She was so focused, she didn&#39;t notice or care as she began to feet the air against her skin. She couldn&#39;t feet her toes anymore. Her center of gravity began to change. She felt the weight of her tiny horns. She felt her tail connected to her spine and begin to sway behind her, feeling the swoosh of air from her bare behind. Her hands becoming armored digits rather than covered in brown gloves. Her vision changed as her face morphed and fused with her new muzzle and her teeth flattened. <br />
<br />
And she grew taller, and taller, as her muscle mass doubled, and doubled again. Her loose costume became a chilished female shape of muscle perfection. Her breasts grew to match her new height and size. A gold ring appeared in her nose, followed by her nipples, while brass guards formed on her wrists and ankles. Her eyes turned blood red. <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m gonna beat this-<br />
<br />
<i>arrogant dragon.&#39;</i>&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not some-<br />
<br />
<i>weak human.</i>&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m a-<br />
<br />
<i>mighty minotaur.</i><br />
<br />
As Venessa snorted, she could smell <i>delicious human flesh</i>, but not as much as she thought there&#39;d be. <br />
<br />
But there are laws, like <i>might makes right</i>. Wait that&#39;s- <i>the law of nature.</i> But I follow <i>the strongest side.</i> Right, the weaker followed the stronger, that was just nature. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re good!&quot; James hissed. Veins bulging on his arms and forehead that would have been a dead give away he was not wearing a costume if not for Rosa&#39;s hypnotic suggestion. &quot;BUT! NOT! GOOD! E-NOUGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
James slammed Venessa arms down with a shockwave. <br />
<br />
Venessa painted, looking in shock, before bowing her head to James. &quot;You are the stronger side, for now, I follow you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you do,&quot; Rosa said leaning on James triumphantly like she&#39;d won the contest. <br />
<br />
&#39;Six to go,&#39; Rosa thought.</p>
