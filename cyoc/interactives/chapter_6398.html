<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing below the class seated in rows of elevated seating he looked out at the students. Pacing about he must have looked like a caged beast to some as the muffled laughter soon began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning Class!<br />
<br />
Today we shall begin a chapter on.....on.... the history of magic in the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
The students begin to walk about till one young lady stood up.<br />
&quot;Professor Davis, we were in the middle of the book you prescribed we read on the Kings and Queens of the 15th century to present, why the sudden change?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Professor just stood looking out at the class, his mind ablaze with wonder as to why he did change to schedule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think this could be a part of our discussion today since I met a....ahh, well the Kings and Queens had their troubles with the belief in magic during their lives!&quot; Davis stammered out.<br />
<br />
As he stood there looking up into the crowd his mind wandered and imagination took his will on an excursion. The pretty young lady was maybe 20 years old and with her long, long hair she reminded Davis somewhat of Lysaila. &quot;Gee, she would be a sassy one if she came to me after class, I wish she came to me then as a satyr for some sex!&quot; he thought to himself and then began to teach his class again.<br />
<br />
As class finished the questioning young lady sat in a circle of girls talking about the strange day's class in World History. Suddenly the girl stood up and as the others watched intently she stepped down the steps to talk with the Professor. After just a minute passed the Professor found himself surrounded by not less than ten pretty girls, all friends with his dream girl.<br />
<br />
Turning to walk the hallway to his study Davis thought to himself, &quot;Such would be nice if my office were a private as a penthouse and these girls stepping inside became all as sexy satyrs like Lysaila, damn how I wish for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Davis entered his study the room swirled about in change. Rafts of books became windows on the world. His desk opened up to be a bed, heart shaped and 12 feet across. The carpet changed from ratty wool to a green turf, like the grass on a putting green. A sudden fear, and he turned to see the girls walk into his office. One after another like sheep following the ram came inside the room. As each walked in her complexion, and form changed from young women to sexy female satyrs. As each changed they quickly accepted their purpose and lusted for Davis as if all were animals in heat.<br />
<br />
Three of the satyrs tossed Davis on the bed as the total group tore away his clothes. Suddenly he lay on the broad bed as he watched his body being touched, sucked, and kissed by the harem of satyr women. <br />
<br />
The massive thrill was making him think of sexual desires and soon he heard himself speak a wish. &quot;Oh I want to satisfy you all if I can! Oh, oh, if only I were a great male satyr and we could fuck with true goat style sex, I could give you so much, oh I wish Lysaila was here to grant my wish!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So much the male! I am here my Master, and you have your wish! A great satyr named Cedius shall you become. Well furred, big balls, long cock, ringed horns about the head, perky ears, and a long tongue for goosing all females. I note we have no classes till 2p.m. so let your delights flow and ensure each of satyress' be pregnant with a kid before they leave. Oh and save some for your romp tonight with Franciene, Lulu, Alice and of course, Me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon enough Cedis Davis, professor of World History was making history as he jumped from one humping to another. No sooner had he spasmed and filling wach satyress to overflow with his seed did he begin with one more. As each encounter led to deeper sexual pleasure he found more enjoyment, evermore satisfied and still not having enough thrill he longer for more.<br />
<br />
The grandfather clock near the door chimed 2:00 and he jumped away from his thrusting to grab some books a run out into the hallway and class.<br />
<br />
Thud, he bumped into John Wilks a strong and tall football player for the college. The thought of his sexual form he made a quick turn away from the student.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy Professor, you didn't hurt me with the door!&quot; the young man said.<br />
<br />
Looking at the calm young man he then looked down at his body expecting to see his satyr self. Instead he stood in his gray suit and red shoes like normal ready for his class.<br />
<br />
The 2:00p.m. class went by so slowly and he stammered over much of his text. At last it was over for the day and he needed to grade tests. Walking down the hallway he was ready to enter his study room when the Dean and two Policemen approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Davis, yes we have some questions, may we go inside?' asked the Dean.<br />
<br />
Davis stood gawking at them for a moment and then opening the studyroom door he walked inside. Looking up, the room was as a professor's study should be, rafts of books, dusty, and worn carpets too. Looking about he saw nothing to remind him of his ten sexy satyrs or the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Professor you were seen leaving the morning class with ten young women!  Since that time their friends have tried to contact them by celphone and checking on their apartments. Odd as it seems but their apartments were clean of all belongings as if they left school and town. I called their parents and they denied even knowing or having daughters, at all!  Now I checked the scool records and we show no admission of them as students, no grades, no nothing. It's like history swallowed them up!&quot; said the Dean as the Policemen looked on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what to say Dean, these girls, ahh, young women you mentioned never came to me, I don't even remember what your talking about, bet this is a prathouse prank!&quot; explained Davis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your right, I'll expell that foolish young man for making this all up!&quot; said the Dean with fire in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Davis opened the door for the three men and then asked, &quot; When you see that young man have him come here to see me before you give him the kick, I have a couple of suggestions for him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Davis closed the door and turned to grade his work.<br />
<br />
POOF! &quot;Master Cedius please do us again!&quot; said one of the ten sexy satyress standing in his now penthouse stud farm.<br />
<br />
Davis looked at the big clock and smiled to see it being 3:30 pm. A look to his sexy harem and the thought he need not be home for Lysaila, Alice, Franciene, or Lulu till near midnight. He could get his exercise and pleasure till then.</p>
