<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the next battles Beth learned to deal with the strain of the battles. In the second round she Gaurdune defeated a elvish priest called Nicodemus and in round three Emily was able to slay a human knight who used a mace as a weapon. Round four was Marcus first battle and he was victorious against a giant called Jack. But in round five Gaurdune fought against a sorcerer named Owen. He was able to slay the sorcerer but was heavy wounded and it seemed like the rest in his card wouldn't be enough to cur before the enxt battle. Luckily there was a longer break after this round cause the area would be prepared for the semi-finals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Beth you did it!&quot;, yelled Josh in the preparation area,&quot;You were one of the four finalists!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, pretty cool, huh.&quot;, said Amy.<br />
&quot;Did you know who will be my next opponent?&quot;, asked Beth and rested on a bench.<br />
&quot;Let me see.&quot;, said Josh and looked on his laptop. He analysed the whole battles on his laptop gave advices to Beth during the breaks.<br />
&quot;Ok, Martin will fight against a guy called Damon. If have only a few informations about his deck. He is pretty unknown. Ok, and your opponent in the semi-final is...Cathy. Hm, she used a lot of scary fighters. Her favourite is a nightmare called Sebastian. But you can use two fighters in this battle, so better be prepared for some surprise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, so I should use my best fighters like Emily. But Gaurdune was wounded and Marcus was too exhausted from his battle against Jack. And I think that this will be a bit too heavy for Stephanie.&quot;<br />
&quot;Seems like you have no other choice.&quot;, said Amy,&quot;You must use Danny in this battle. He seems to be also very strong.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, but I hope he will play along and don't fool around.&quot;<br />
&quot;It is your only chance.&quot;, said Josh.<br />
<br />
After the sound of the bell Beth walked out to the arena and faced her opponent. On the other side stood an eighteen-year old girl with long blonde hair wearing a black gothic-like dress.<br />
&quot;Hey, you little girl will be my opponent?&quot;, asked the goth girl,&quot;You must have a lot of luck to come this far. But now play time is over.&quot;<br />
&quot;Will you talk all the day or can we start before christmas is over.&quot;, countered Beth.<br />
&quot;Tough speaking. I summon you nightmare paladin Sebastian and seductive vampire Serena.&quot;<br />
&quot;I summon you elvish champion Emily and orcish captain Daniel.&quot;<br />
When Emily appeared on the battlefield she took a deep breath and and tried to prepare, but Danny beside her looked rather bored.<br />
&quot;Hey, Danny. Watch out, we are in a battle.&quot;<br />
&quot;What's the matter I won't fight for a looser like your sister.&quot;<br />
Before Emily could answer anything the battle went on.<br />
&quot;I use &quot;Vampire claws&quot; on Serena and &quot;Lance of Darkness&quot; on Sebastian.&quot;, yelled Cathy.<br />
Serena, a black-haired woman with white tan and revealing red dress, smiled with her fangs when razor claws appeared on her hands. Sebastian had also a white tan, but it is hard to be more detailed cause he was wearing a black armor and the visor of his helmet covered his eyes. He was riding a black horse with glowing red eyes and using now two black lances for battle. The only thing Emily could see was his scary smile on his uncovered lower face.<br />
&quot;Ok, I used &quot;Elven armor&quot; and &quot;Elven twin blades&quot; on Emily and &quot;Orcish double-axe&quot; on Daniel.&quot;, said Beth using their cards.<br />
<br />
From the moment when the swords appeared in Emily's hands, she was under attack. At first there was this vampire a made a loud scream and tried to slash Emily with her claws. She tried to counter, but then came this nightmare guy and tried to ride above her. Emily jumped aside and slayed after him, but he was so fast that he was out of reach. All the time Danny stood just aside and do...nothing. Even Cathy didn't waste time to attack him and concentrated her whole power on Emily.<br />
&quot;Damned. Danny, do something!&quot;, yelled Beth.<br />
&quot;Why should I fight? You have captured me!&quot;<br />
&quot;You know that you would did the same if had lost. You know that this is our only chance to find a cure for Jake to get him free.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is not my problem. He should be more careful!&quot;, said Danny in ignorant tone.<br />
&quot;Do you konw something, Danny?&quot;, said Emily parrying a another riding attack of Sebastian,&quot;Marcus was right. Your a the true looser. All the time you played the tough guy, but know when you are in trouble your are a coward.&quot;<br />
&quot;What did you say?! I'm not a coward!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, if Emily loose, we must battle other owner to find a cure, even if it take years. And all the time you will be a fighter.&quot;, said Emily trying to hit the vampire, &quot;If you want to be free than help us, so we can help you.&quot;<br />
&quot;If you are ready to discuss with your fighters, we can finish this.&quot;, said Cathy, grinning about Beth distress, &quot;I use my magic card &quot;Scream of the banshee&quot;. Serena, finish her elf.&quot;<br />
Emily was just fighting against the nightmare and caused him to drop one of his lances, when she suddenly heard a high shriek. She turned around to see the vampire screaming, but suddenly her motions stopped. She wasn't able to move, bound by the attack of Serena. The vampire came closer, she rose her hand to make the finishing move and then ... she collapsed and felt to the ground. Emily, still shocked by the spell, but also by the events, was speechless. Then she saw the double axe in Serena's back.<br />
Danny, who threw it from his place came near, grabbed his axe and watched Serena's corpse vanishing. Emily, still surprised from what had happened was able to move again and wanted to ask Danny question, but he interrupted her.<br />
&quot;This has nothing to do with you. Your fate was unimportant for me. But if I shall be fighter, than I will be the best fighter of all, and for this aim I must face any enemy my owner send me against.&quot;<br />
&quot;As long as you help us, it's fine for me.&quot;, said Emily, facing nightmare paladin, the last remaining opponent.<br />
&quot;Nice turn. But I am still able to win this.&quot;, said Cathy, drawing another card, &quot;Infernal strength.&quot;<br />
Sebastian and his horse started to glow in red corona and he had again his scary smile. He rushed against Danny and Emily, aiming with his remaining lance.<br />
&quot;Wanna finish the rest, Danny?&quot;, asked Beth.<br />
&quot;Ready, when you are.&quot;, answered Danny.<br />
&quot;I use my card &quot;Goblin batallion&quot; on Danny and &quot;Elven longbow&quot; on Emily.&quot;<br />
Twelve little Goblins with swords and clubs appeared around Danny and Emily's swords were replaced by a bow. Aiming with it, she shot an arrow against the rushing Sebastian. The wasn't critical, but hard enough to throw him down from his horse.<br />
&quot;Danny, it's your turn.&quot;, yelled Emily.<br />
&quot;Alright, are you ready to die for me. Goblins, attack.&quot;<br />
With this command the goblins rushed over the nightmare. Although they were small, they were annoying enough to held him down. Emily and Danny went to the defenseless fighter and use their weapons at the same time to kill Sebastian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, a really good battle!&quot;, said Cathy after the battle, when she and Beth left the arena. &quot;You showed me that even a little child can have a massive power.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, Cathy. You weren't bad either. You're combination of speed and power was great.&quot;, replied Beth.<br />
&quot;I hope you win the final. It's always better to lose again the winner of a tournament.&quot;, smiled Cathy.<br />
When she reached the preparation area Cathy went to the tribune for watching the final and Beth went in to prepare for her last battle.<br />
Josh and Amy were waiting for her.<br />
&quot;Hey, guys. So, Josh, who was my last opponent? Who won the other semi-final?&quot;</p>
