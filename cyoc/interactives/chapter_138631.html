<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa slowly made her way to the &quot;guest&quot; room that presently John and Janice Harper shared. It had once been Huck&#39;s bedroom, but when he moved out into his own place, it became a guest bedroom. That was something that had become favorable with the sense that her daughter in law, Jenny Harper-Jenkins had been able to convince her mother to transfer custody of Janice and John to her and Harry. Lisa knew that was going to be good for the younger Harpers, as from what Jenny had told her about her time growing up... or from what Jenny had told Harry and Harry then talked to Lisa and Henry Sr. about, that it was to some degree a miracle that Jennifer and James Harper Jr. had turned out as well as they did. And even there, Lisa was privately sure that both of them had had their own issues in growing up with a father that was strict to borderline abusive, both mentally and physically, and a mother that was complicit in that matter.<br />
<br />
But, Moon Lake would be a new start for both John and Janice, even if some of the real plusses to it didn&#39;t happen yet because of some of the legal paperwork that related to Jenny getting custody over her younger siblings. In the meantime, while Henry took John with him to help with repair job at the Twists, Lisa had taken to teaching some things to Janice that would hopefully get Janice interested in a hobby that Janice could enjoy in her spare time. The explosion of anger and frustration that Janice had thrown at her father after the revelation of what an &quot;intended&quot; was surprised Lisa to a great degree, as she didn&#39;t think there was any reason for there to be any worry about that. For as far as Lisa knew, things seemed legally set for that shift in custody to Jenny and Harry and she knew that neither of them would force Janice into a decision she didn&#39;t want. There was also the issue of James Harper Senior&#39;s health, which did not seem to be great and that the medical costs was a big reason why he had accepted the change in custody. But Janice did explode with anger and vowing that her father would never ruin her life the way he tried to ruin Jenny&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice,&quot; Lisa spoke softly as she heard some shuffling going on in the room through the shut door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t let him ruin my life!&quot; came the answer through the door.<br />
<br />
Lisa slowly opened it to find Janice packing a collection of clothes that had been delivered for the Harper children into one of Huck&#39;s old backpacks. Her eyes were red and narrowed, and Lisa could understand that. Life in the Harper household had to be rough and no one would truly want to go through that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he won&#39;t, dear,&quot; Lisa spoke as she came into the room and sat down on the bed that was set for John with her eyes focused to Janice, &quot;Your older sister has done a LOT to get you and your brother here where you can be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said...&quot; Janice said turning to face the older woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said that was your father&#39;s intention,&quot; Lisa took Janice&#39;s hands, &quot;and from all that I&#39;ve been told... your father was a fairly despicable human being. But your sister and my Harry won&#39;t let that happen. You will be free here and you&#39;ll get to make your own choices and fall in love with whoever you fall in love with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if it doesn&#39;t work?&quot; Janice asked, &quot;What if Dad fights it in Alabama? What if someone else takes his side and Junior can&#39;t stop him? He&#39;d just have the law come back here for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And running away will help?&quot; Lisa asked, noting exactly what Janice was doing.<br />
<br />
Janice pulled away from Lisa for a moment and looked to the backpack that was presently on the bed set aside for her. It wasn&#39;t much, and had been a bit beat up, but she&#39;d found it was still functional and decided to use it once she made it to the guest room. It was presently open with a few pieces of the clothing she&#39;d been given sticking out of it. They weren&#39;t folded neatly and as such might take up more space than they might otherwise, but Janice had figured it was best to get things done quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He can&#39;t ruin my life if he can&#39;t find me,&quot; Janice answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would you do? How would you eat?&quot; Lisa asked, &quot;those in Moon Lake that know who you are would return you here... and those that might not... would still be curious as to how a lone girl running away from home ended up on their doorstep... And if you leave Moon Lake... you&#39;d only be inviting trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice didn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do have mundane predators here, that wouldn&#39;t be above attacking you if they&#39;re hungry,&quot; Lisa said slowly, &quot;Black Bears and Mountain Lions are powerful animals in their own right... And from some of the stories I&#39;ve heard is that those that occasionally wander into the outer edges of town have been far more vicious toward weres than they would be otherwise. So... how would you keep yourself safe? A campfire won&#39;t burn all night, and even if it did, you can only have so much for fuel... or matches... not to mention the dangers of playing with fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice again didn&#39;t answer, as she really didn&#39;t know. She looked down to her feet for a moment and just stared downward for a moment. She didn&#39;t move as Lisa stood up, though she did notice some movement as the older woman came closer to her. She didn&#39;t even fight as she felt Lisa Jenkins pull her into a warm and protective hug, one that actually felt protective.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;ve been through a lot,&quot; Lisa answered, &quot;Jenny&#39;s told me that much... But Henry and I... Jenny and Harry... John... ALL of us have your back Janice. I promise you that you will be free here. It may not be finalized over night... but you will be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot; Janice asked as she looked up to Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise,&quot; Lisa answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can get to be a weremer and marry my prince charming?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe the Prince&#39;s name in Disney&#39;s version was Eric,&quot; Lisa chuckled, &quot;but yes. When you turn fourteen and that is REALLY what you want to be... you will be free to. But... until then, you&#39;ll have to wait. And who knows, maybe your one true love won&#39;t be a weremer... or even a were. The big thing is that you will be free to make that choice. I promise you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d want him to be a weremer,&quot; Janice answered.<br />
<br />
Lisa only chuckled and held Janice to her. She was serious in her promise to protect Janice and John, and she would do everything in her power to give them both the freedom to be who they were. At the same time, though, she got the nagging feeling that both Janice and John might need to see professional help off and on in order to help come to terms with the abuse they received. James Junior might have gotten through his with the help of the woman he&#39;d met, Jenny had likely gotten through hers when she became a were, but Janice and John hadn&#39;t had that benefit. John was confused on just who he was and Janice seemed to be clinging to some sort of fantasy regarding being a weremer and getting a storybook ending. That sort of desire wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but it did look as though Janice was pursuing it further than what most would have gone over with regard to the decision to become a were and what were to be. In that, it might be a good idea to let both of them see Doctor Twist on occasion, if only to let them get all the abuse that James Harper Senior had put on them out.</p>
