<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Putting on the jacket, Eric started to look for new clothes himself. He had made sure to help Hank, but now that his brother seemed to be almost finished, Eric went from different racks and selves pulling items that he liked and would fit.<br />
	<br />
As Eric went to head into a dressing room, Hank came out. “How do I look?”<br />
	<br />
“Great buddy.” Looking at his brother, Eric saw Hank looked to be in that awkward phase in his development where Hank was tall, but his height made him very gangly. This also showed that when Hank filled out, he would be massive.<br />
	<br />
“Get the things that you like and fit together. I’m going to try on some stuff and then we can head home. Okay?”<br />
	<br />
“Sure.”<br />
	<br />
Closing the door to his changing room, Eric slipped the jacket off. At first his reflection confused him. He was still massive, having grown a least a few inches, but for some reason, his muscles just looked different. It was only after he pulled his shirt off that Eric realized what had happened. While Eric’s muscle seemed to have grown, they now also had a solid layer of padding. The stomach had lost the hard cut abs, and his face even had a bit of roundness to it under a bit of peach fuzz. Seeing the peach fuzz, Eric went over his body again and found a happy trail leading up from his groin and a generous amount on his arms.<br />
	<br />
Eric was thrilled with his new development, but he now eyed the jacket wearily. Not only had he gained the height he wanted, had had also gained the extra weight he would need for playing a lineman. It was almost like the jacket knew what its wearer wanted. Putting the jacket on a hook, Eric began going through his chosen garments.<br />
	<br />
While Kyle waited with Hank for Eric to finish up, he started to notice more and more the way that people were looking at him. Every time a woman, and a few men, passed, they could not help but stare for a few moments. This would not have been much of an issue except a couple of the women had been his mother’s age.<br />
	<br />
Finally having enough, “Hank, I’m going to put on something a little more casual. Can you stay here and tell your brother where I’ve gone?”<br />
	<br />
“Sure no problem. See you in a few.”<br />
	<br />
Slipping into a dressing room, Kyle took a good look at himself. Trying to imagine the way the women viewed him, Kyle came to the conclusion that he looked like a young professional just out of college. With the jacket and the loafers he and also purchase, he could probably walk into a law firm and be thought to be someone interning for their law degree. The only thing that marred the image was his lack of wearing a tie. Cicil had tried to convince Kyle to get some ties; he just couldn’t bring himself to purchase them. They reminded Kyle of his own father wearing a tie.<br />
	<br />
Placing his bags on the floor, Kyle started to go through his purchases to see what he would like to wear. Taking on his sports jacket, black loafers, black leather belt, black pants and white button down shirt, Kyle was left standing in his boxers and a very form fitting white t-shirt.<br />
	<br />
Pulling out a pair of jeans and a plaid button down shirt, he got dressed. Along with his jeans he added a thick brown leather belt. His brown belt wasn’t like his black belt. His black belt was shinny and on the thinner side. The brown belt he put on looked like something a cowboy would wear with a large belt buckle. Pulling out some brown boots that Cicil had insisted he buy along with his new loafers and a pair of cross training shoes, Kyle slipped the boots on and stood to look at himself in the mirror.<br />
	<br />
Kyle like the way that he looked, but he could not help but feel that the untucked plaid shirt was not right. Tucking the hem into his pants, Kyle could not help but think that all he needed was a big belt buckle and a stetson to complete the look. <br />
	<br />
Putting his other clothes into the bags, Kyle headed out and found Hank still waiting on his brother. As he waited for Eric to finish, Kyle was approached by a young woman. She was much younger than most of the other people that had been ogling him earlier. She looked to still be in her teens, though maybe a few years older than Kyle.<br />
	<br />
“Hi, My name’s Jill.” She said, offering her hand.<br />
	<br />
“Kyle.” He replied, taking the proffered hand and shaking it. “What can I do for you?”<br />
	<br />
“Well, you see, I’m in my freshman year of college, and I’m interning with a photographer. His does photography for stores like this mall, and he sent me here to see if I could find anyone shopping that I thought would be a good model. Seeing you, I think that I have hit jackpot.”<br />
	<br />
“What about me?” Hank asked butting into the conversation.<br />
	<br />
“Who is this?” Jill asked Kyle.<br />
	<br />
“This is Hank. He’s the younger brother of my best friend, who is currently in the dressing room trying on clothes.”<br />
	<br />
“Well nice to meet you Hank.” Jill said turning to the younger man. “But right now I’m not looking for someone to model for teenage clothing.”<br />
	<br />
“Really, because we might have a problem then.” Kyle continued with a mischievous grin. “How old do you think I am?”<br />
	<br />
“Aren’t you like twenty or something?”<br />
	<br />
Chuckling, Kyle had to shake his head, “Sorry, you’re off a few years?”<br />
	<br />
“What you&#39;re like twenty-two? Why would that be a problem?”<br />
	<br />
“Try younger.”<br />
	<br />
Squinting her eyes and pouting her lips, “Nineteen?”<br />
	<br />
Kyle shook his head.<br />
	<br />
“Eighteen.”<br />
	<br />
“Nope.”<br />
	<br />
“You’re seventeen! There’s no way!”<br />
	<br />
“Actually, I’m sixteen and a sophomore in high school, along with my friend in the changing room. Hank here is eleven. He skipped a year.”<br />
	<br />
The entire time Kyle was talking, Jill’s eyes kept getting bigger and bigger. With eyes as big a saucers, “How? Where? What the fuck?! Impossible!”<br />
	<br />
“Yep. I turned sixteen a few months back. Sorry, but I know I can’t model for you without my parent’s consent, and my mom would probably say no.”<br />
	<br />
Quickly digging into her purse, Jill pulled out three business cards. “Listen. This is my boss’s information. His website in on there along with his phone number and email address. Talk to your parents. You could do really well, even if it is only a side thing.” Handing one to Kyle, Jill then handed the other two to Hank. “You should also consider it, and hell, give the other one to your brother. If you genetics are anything to go by…”<br />
	<br />
“Uh, yeah, genetics.” Kyle clumsily said, not knowing if he should mention the jacket, or even if he mentioned it, wondering if Jill would get that vacant look.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys. Are you ready to go?” Eric called out after stepping out of the dressing room.<br />
	<br />
Seeing Eric, Jill could only say, “Damn!” Then turning around, she headed off into the rest of the mall.<br />
	<br />
“Who was that?” Eric asked.<br />
	<br />
“Just some photographer’s intern going around the mall, scouting for prospective models.” Seeing Eric eyes lighting up Kyle added, “Of course, since we are under eighteen, we would need to get our parents permission.” This comment brought Eric quickly down to earth.</p>
