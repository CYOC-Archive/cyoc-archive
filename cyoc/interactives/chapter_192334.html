<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Sorry,” you finally announced to Nat after being pressed for an answer, “there’s no way I’m putting myself or Jessica through that hell again. Now that I’m back to normal I’m determined to stay that way!”<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause following this outburst as your words seemed to hang in the air. In response, Nat simply remained silent as she looked you up and down blankly. <br />
<br />
“That’s a pity,” she finally said as she looked down in disappointment, “your cooperation would have proven useful. Now I shall have to re-think my plans and try to bring down the Zoo some other way.”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on,” you said slightly guiltily, “you must have some sort of backup plan or at least some other ideas?”<br />
<br />
“Well I suppose there is one thing...” Nat said quietly. “Maybe THIS will work…”<br />
<br />
You weren’t given any time to react before Nat raised her arm and you felt a sudden spike of pain lancing into your neck. You remained stunned for a few moments as you felt what was unmistakably a syringe sticking into your skin, steadily injecting something into your bloodstream that instantly made the surrounding area feel numb.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?!” you finally said as you pushed Nat away and threw the syringe to the floor, “what have you done to me?”<br />
<br />
“Relax dear,” Nat said with a smile as you struggled to focus on her, “I didn’t want it to come to this but you rather forced my hand. Trust me, this whole process would be much smoother without you second-guessing everything I do. But don’t worry, when you wake up you will realise that this is all for your own good; and for the good of your family…<br />
<br />
“Y-you…” you struggled to reply, “you l-little b-bi…” <br />
<br />
Sadly, you were unable to finish telling Nat what you thought of her before you felt your head spinning and your balance failing you. You would have fallen if Nat hadn’t been there to catch you and ease you down gently.<br />
<br />
“That’s it dear,” you heard Nat whisper to you softly, “remember, this is the only way…”<br />
<br />
Hearing this desperately made you want to fight back and escape the woman’s clutches. Instead though, you could do little more than mumble incomprehensibly before you completely lost control and your vision gradually faded to black…<br />
<br />
[some time later…]<br />
<br />
“Nnnngh…” you grumbled as you finally opened your heavy eyes. Everything seemed fuzzy and out of focus as your senses struggled to come back online. ‘Where am I?’ you thought to yourself as you tried to take in your surroundings, “what’s going on…”<br />
<br />
Your thoughts trailed off as the scene around you started to come into focus. You quickly worked out that you were in some kind of barn, judging by the straw on the ground and the strong scents of animals that filled the air.<br />
<br />
As strange as this was, things quickly got far more disturbing when you attempted to move. You tried to stand, only to find that you weren’t even lying down; but rather you were on your hands and knees, with four tight metal rings securing your arms and legs to the floor. As well as this, you also felt a strong chill gripping your body. At first you put this down to fear, but when you looked down at yourself you quickly realised that this was actually because you were completely naked!<br />
<br />
This terrifying revelation finally made you wake up to your surroundings as you tugged desperately on the restraints around your wrists and ankles. As well as this you also tried crying for help, but sadly the fact that you had also been gagged meant that the sounds coming out of your mouth sounded more like pathetic whimpers. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you weren’t given very long to take everything in before you heard footsteps approaching...<br />
<br />
“Ah excellent,” Nat’s distinctive voice announced as she stepped into view, “finally we can begin!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you bristle in anger as you detected a clear hint of excitement in the woman’s demeanor. However, your reaction soon changed to one of both confusion and fear as you noticed that she was pointing a video camera straight at you!<br />
<br />
“That’s it,” Nat said as she moved the camera in-close to your face, “let’s get one last look at you whilst you’re still human. Mmmmm… I just can’t wait to see that adorable face of yours stretching out into something more suitable. Don’t you see dear, you can’t escape your fate; you were always destined to become an animal forever!”<br />
<br />
Nat’s words made you seethe with rage as you continued to fight against your restraints. However, this only made the woman laugh as she sauntered around your trapped form, making sure to capture you from every angle as she put on a show in front of the camera.<br />
<br />
“Awwww,” you heard Nat say to the camera as she returned to your front, “it seems our first little troublemaker is still a bit nervous about becoming an animal again. No matter, I’m sure he’ll be willing once he learns that he won’t be alone…”    <br />
<br />
With that, Nat excitedly moved to your left and started to pull back a large curtain that was hanging nearby. In all the confusion you hadn’t really noticed that this was there, but sadly you didn’t have very long to reflect on this before you recoiled in horror. There, looking back at you on the other side of the curtain, were Kev and Jessica!<br />
<br />
Seeing this made your heart stop for a minute as you struggled to comprehend what you were looking at. Like you, both had been restrained and completely stripped naked, such that they were both being held firmly in place by two identical sets of restraints. On the left, Kev looked truly baffled by his surroundings as his eyes darted around the room in shock. However, in that moment you were only focused on Jessica as she stared back at you with a horrified expression on her face. Unlike Kev, you and your girlfriend already knew what was in store, and that knowledge just made the whole situation even more terrifying.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmmm....” Nat purred as she crouched down between Kev and Jessica and ran her hands through their hair, “what fine, healthy specimens you will make. Transforming you three will be its own reward, though I won’t say no to the juicy promotion I can expect for my efforts!”<br />
<br />
“Fummmmk ymmmmm!”, you tried to say through the gag in your mouth. You knew you should never have trusted this psychopath. How could you have been this stupid?<br />
<br />
“Awww,” Nat said back to you with a smile, “do you want to say something dearie? Well I hate to break it to you but most animals aren’t known for their linguistic abilities. Instead, you will be much better suited to a life of servitude. Soon, you will be good for nothing but breeding and rearing your young; something which I know you will come to enjoy!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you grimace as you once again fought against your restraints. Nat was now talking exactly like Vicky used to; something which shook you to the core as you had a few brief flashbacks to your time at the Stables. Remembering all of those lessons about stallions and mating, as well as the occasions when Vicky had played with your equine pussy, all made you feel sick as you suspected that you would soon be put through a similar ordeal.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t get so upset dear,” Nat said as she moved back over to you, “you don’t have to pretend that you don’t want this anymore. Just think, soon all of your pesky human worries will be forgotten; and you will be able to embrace the dirty, horny animal that you really are. What do you say dear, doesn’t that sound wonderful?!”<br />
<br />
Instead of answering you simply glared at Nat in anger. Knowing that you, Kev and Jessica had all been doomed because of your own gullible stupidity made you hate yourself just as much as your sadistic captor. The Zoo had already taken your family away from you, and now they were going to take everything else. Soon your entire life would be in ruins, leaving you and your loved ones with nothing but the grim realisation that you would remain as animals forever...<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Nat said as she interrupted your disturbed thoughts, “I think it’s about time we got this show on the road. To begin with, it is always more fun to transform a first-timer; which is why we shall start with YOU…”<br />
<br />
Nat grinned in anticipation as she delivered this line, before she turned and pointed dramatically at Kev. In response, you could see your friend clearly recoiling in fear. Although he hadn’t yet been through the same ordeal as you and Jessica, you suspected that Kev was currently going over everything you had told him about your time at the Stables in his mind, still desperately hoping that transforming into an animal was impossible. Sadly, you knew all-too-well that this was nothing but wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
“Hmmmm…” Nat said as she moved to examine Kev more closely, “what to turn you into I wonder? Maybe an animal that’s big and eye-catching, or perhaps something a bit more small and pathetic will suit you best?”<br />
<br />
As Nat said this, Kev seemed to become increasingly agitated as he stared at the woman teasing him. However, seeing this reaction seemed to only make Nat more excited as she licked her lips in anticipation.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Nat finally said as she sauntered in front of Kev, “I know exactly what to do with you. I think you’ll make a wonderful...”</p>
