<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now clear your minds&quot; Shaela said. &quot;If a thought comes across your minds just let it go and don't dwell on it. Once you have accomplished that focus on me and my power.&quot;<br />
<br />
They had problems at first but eventually they were able to do what Shaela said. Jen was the first one to accomplish it. Shaela had them practice it by sensing the power of various life forms in the park until it was second nature to them all. Jen was still the fastest one to sense power. The other three unanimously decided to refer to her without saying anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you have that down it's time to move on to some basic fighting&quot; Shaela said. &quot;After that we'll move on to some more advanced fighting techniques if time allows today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do we need to learn that?&quot; Marry asked. &quot;We can just blast them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaela pinned Marry with an icy stare and said &quot;Because your enemy may be too close to you or innocents for you to use your power. In that case it comes down to hand to hand fighting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But magical girls are supposed to use their powers&quot; Harriette said.<br />
<br />
Shaela sighed and said &quot;You've been watching too many magical girl shows. There are times when you'll need to use your powers and times when you won't. For example, if your enemy has an innocent in it's clutches you don't want to use your powers. If you do you could hurt the innocent. Now, who can give me an example of when to use your power?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When the enemy is clear&quot; Harriette said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is wrong&quot; Shaela said glaring at Harriette. &quot;The only time you should use your power is when you're sure that it has a chance at affecting them and it has a low chance of harming innocents in the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to learn how to use my power though&quot; Harriette said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll learn how to use it soon enough&quot; Shaela said pinning Harriette with an icy stare. &quot;First, you need to learn how to fight. Now transform so we can begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I transform?&quot; Harriette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just grab your necklace and say 'Mystic Girl Power'&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marry&quot; Allison said. &quot;I heard that your parents threw your necklace away. How did you get it back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaela brought it back to me&quot; Marry said. &quot;She can locate any of our necklaces if they're lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do have to train&quot; Shaela reminded them as she grew. She stood up on her hind legs and her forepaws became hands. Two small bumps appeared on her chest and when her transformation was done she looked like she was twelve.<br />
<br />
The girls transformed too. Jen, Allison, and Marry looked like they remembered. Harriette transformed into a semi-fox girl but her costume was different than the others. Instead of being one color it was two. Half of it was red and the other half was blue.<br />
<br />
Shaela looked at Harriette and said &quot;Interesting. If I'm right then you have the elements of fire and water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Elements?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to some traditions there are five elements&quot; Shaela said. &quot;The one tradition we're concerned with is the Wiccan tradition. The five elements according to the Wiccan tradition are spirit, earth, air, fire, and water. Red is usually associated with fire and blue with water. Green is associated with earth so Marry's element is earth. That leaves spirit and air for Jen and Allison. Since Allison has wings I'd say that her element is air. That would mean Jen's element is spirit. Spirit is an important element since it combines the other elements and let's them work in harmony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know all this?&quot; Allison asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was sent to Marry&quot; Shaela said. &quot;I was told to instruct you and my knowledge includes several traditions. I was told that you had elemental powers but not who had which. Enough of that though. It's time to teach you basic defense and offense. Allison, if you'd assist me I'd appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison stepped up to Shaela. Shaela nodded and said &quot;One thing you need to know is weak points. There are common weak points shared by each gender.&quot; She pointed at each in turn as she said &quot;They are the nose, throat, solar plexus, knee, and instep. The groin is also a weak spot in each gender but the males are more vulnerable there. Now on a female who's old enough her breasts are a weak point. A punch to any of these areas is usually enough to slow your opponent down. Now, you want to protect these spots. Throw a punch at me Allison.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison did as Shaela said aiming for her left breast. Shaela easily blocked it. Allison decided to surprise her by trying to knee her in her solar plexus. Shaela was able to block this with ease too. Allison then tried punching her nose. Again Shaela blocked it. &quot;Enough&quot; Shaela said. As soon as Allison had stepped back she continued &quot;I hope you noticed my stance. It's just one stance that allows you to react quickly to attacks whether it's to block or dodge. There are others that I'll teach you and you'll adopt the one you feel fits you best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaela did show them the various stances and then attacked each of them in turn. They were able to block the first punch but the subsequent punches and kicks got through. Jen received a knee to the solar plexus which knocked the wind out of her. Harriette's knee was hit and she hobbled about a bit. Marry had her windpipe closed momentarily with a well aimed punch. Allison was hit in her right breast.<br />
<br />
As the girls were standing rubbing various parts of their body Shaela said &quot;Well that's better than I expected. I didn't think you would block any of my attacks. The problem is that you became cocky when you blocked the first attack. You thought that you could block others and so you let your guard down. Marry, if this had been an actual battle you would most likely be dead. As it is I pulled my punches and kicks so you wouldn't be hurt too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee thanks&quot; Allison said rubbing her breast. She was starting to think that maybe being a girl wasn't all she thought it would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you train you'll learn the tiny signs that indicate what type of attack an opponent is going to use and where it's aimed&quot; Shaela said. &quot;For example, the eyes almost always focus on where the attack will land. But that will have to wait until tomorrow or another day. I have to get you girls back home. Now, change back.&quot; As she was saying this she was shrinking back into a regular cat form. Jen told Harriette the phrase to return to non-magical girl form and they all changed back. As soon as they did Shaela's eyes glowed gold again and they were once again in Jen and Allison's room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to get back before my mum finds out I'm gone&quot; Marry said looking down at the carpet. &quot;I'll see you tomorrow.&quot; Shaela's eyes glowed again and they were gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go too&quot; Harriette said. &quot;Mum and Dad will be surprised to see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they take your change better than Marry's did&quot; Allison said.<br />
<br />
Harriette left and Charlene took her home. Jen and Allison looked at each other and each knew the other was wondering if they would be seeing Marry and Harriette tomorrow.</p>
