<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You have to hide, he can’t see us like this, he’ll think I’m cheating on him!”<br />
“Umm ok sure, but where?”<br />
Dan desperately looks around, thinking of all the possible hiding places. He was in such a panic only one came to his mind.<br />
“You have to hind inside my balls.” He demanded.<br />
“What?”<br />
“You heard me. Come on, there&#39;s no time!”<br />
Jacob looked at Dan’s 2inch wide cock. “There’s no way I could fit through there.”<br />
Dan ignored him and started pulling him closer to his dick.<br />
“Trust me, it’ll stretch. It’s had gallons of cum pushed through it all at once nearly twelve times a day for over a week, it has been loosened up a hell of a lot.”<br />
With that Dan shoved two of Jacob’s fingers into his urethra, they slipped in with little resistance. Seeing this, Jacob started to believe Dan’s crazy claim so guided the rest of his fingers, then hand inside to see if it would actually work. Dan groaned and watched as his cock stretched to the size of Jacob’s hand as it slid inside, then his arm, all the way up to his shoulder.<br />
“Oahhhh! This feels amazing. Keep going.”<br />
Jacob now slid his other hand into the hungry cock, feeling the precum leaking from inside lube his skin. Like his first, his other arm slid up to his shoulder. <br />
“This is so weird man.” Jacob said just before he took a deep breath and, with some help from Dan, shoved his entire head into Dan’s cock. Dan could feel his best friend’s arms bent down into his testicles now. He moved forward, letting his cock’s mouth stretch massively around Jacobs shoulders, sucking him in. <br />
With the hardest part over, Jacob’s naked body slid in quickly up to his hips. Puddles of precum leaking from Dan’s tip onto the carpet. To him it feel like an orgasm in reverse. He could even feel Jacobs upper body fully within his left testicle. Looking down he could see a moving lump that was probably an elbow and shoulder positioning themselves as they fell further within the large ball. Jacob’s cock was next, the hard and throbbing 10 inch cock was dripping precum itself as it was squeezed back against Jacob’s thigh by Dan’s encroaching cock mouth as it enguthed his hips. A shot of cum fired from Jacob’s dick just before it was swallowed along with his thighs. He quickly slid the rest of the way down into Dan’s balls, leaving his feet sticking out. Finally the last bit of Jacob was sucked inside, just as Andrew opened the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey, there you are. How was your day?”<br />
“Oh yeah, mostly uneventful.” Dan replied trying not to look too guilty. As he followed his boyfriend out to the livingroom and giving him a kiss on the cheek. “Mostly TV and wanks. What about you? You’re home early”<br />
As Andrew told Dan about his day, Dan tried subtly to look down at his balls behind him, searching for any obvious sign that he had a guy inside one of his balls. <br />
There was definitely a moving lump kinda shaped like Jacob on his left size, so Dan made sure Andrew was always on the opposite side to him. He also quickly turned off the TV as he shuffled past, to hide the fact that it was set to Co-op.<br />
<br />
Jacob found himself in a very tight, damp, yet warm and slimy environment. After he was fully inside Dan’s testicle he rolled himself over to be right side up and so that his head was above the surface of the pool of cum. He was so glad there was enough air for him to breath while he hid there. The walls of Dan’s testicle were very tight and constricting, forcing Jacob to keep himself curled up as much as possible. <br />
“This is so fucking weird!” He murmured to himself as he looked around. To his relief it wasn’t pitch black inside. The light from outside leaked in with a red tinge, the same way it would if you held a torch behind someone&#39;s ear. It was surprisingly comfortable in there once he was used to having to keep himself balanced and head above the surface whenever Dan moved around. It was like being in a small spa full of slime with the lid over top. He realised there wasn’t much he could do until Dan let him out, and he guessed that wouldn’t be until Andew was away. He hoped that it would be sooner rather than later as he curled up tight and tried to have a nap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dan was relieved when the squirming inside him stopped. He could still feel Jacob pressed against the wall of his nut, but it was just a light pressure, rather than like something was trying to escape from the inside. <br />
*Don’t worry buddy, I’ll get you out once Andrew heads out again or goes to sleep.* He thought to himself. Hopeful it wouldn’t be too long. Though he wasn’t 100% sure how he is to get him out, but cumming him out from a wank was his best guess. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately Andrew never left Dan’s side all night, it was movie night. They sat cuddled up naked under a blanket together. Laying on Dan’s bean bag balls in front of the TV watching a movie Andrew had been keen to watch all week. Dan made sure he was on the left ball. This meant he could feel Jacob pressed up against his side, a thick layer of scrotum skin separating the two. Throughout the movie he could feel his best friend moving inside him, getting into better positions, even poking Dan’s ribs with this finger every so often as if to say: Hey, maybe it’s time to let me out. With Andrew laying on his balls, Dan knew he couldn’t yet so just ignored Jacob as much as possible.<br />
<br />
By the time the movie had ended all three were fast asleep.</p>
