<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Far from Moon Lake and with concerns that weren&#39;t entirely focused on the worries of exposure James Harper Junior continued to sit with his mother, Elizabeth Harper, in a waiting room in an Alabama hospital. They weren&#39;t too far from their own small home town, though the hospital was in their county seat and had its own tensions to worry about. Though, for the pair of them the biggest concern was the fate of James Harper Senior, who&#39;d managed to have a series of heart attacks in Moon Lake after finding out that Jenny had already married the young Harry Jenkins. Those attacks had betrayed to the Harpers that James Senior had largely been in poor health for years and had only avoided death through dumb luck, and the doctor in Moon Lake had mentioned something on James Senior likely having several smaller heart attacks earlier in life.<br />
<br />
In theory, more should have been done in Moon Lake before James Harper Senior was taken back to Alabama, given the issues with his heart that he had, but theory and reality didn&#39;t really meet. The insurance company that covered James Harper Senior&#39;s health wouldn&#39;t accept recommendations from a Washington based doctor at face value and thus required a second opinion be obtained in Alabama. Thus they came home and had scheduled some of the appointments as needed. Things seemed to work out well enough that James Junior could consider getting ready to head back to his own college and resume his own education and being with the lovely woman that he&#39;d found and who loved him back, but things soon turned for he worse. For James Sr. had also had his fair share of other vices and issues, which had largely sidelined his wife Elizabeth Harper. The two did seem to love each other, but it was also something that at times had seemed one sided over years and which Elizabeth had largely let happen. <br />
<br />
However, recently, Elizabeth Harper had seemed to either regain some of her independence or gain the courage to be more independent. It was something that was good for Elizabeth and for Jenny&#39;s plans for John and Janice as Elizabeth gaining her independence had been what was needed for James Senior to accept handing custody of his youngest children to his eldest daughter and her new husband in Moon Lake. The only complication that had come from this came as Elizabeth had tried to sort out certain things like the will that James Harper had had made after he and Elizabeth had married, which largely left him in ownership over nearly everything and thus in control of nearly everything under &quot;his roof.&quot; That soon lead to another argument and in turn lead to another major heart attack that now lead them to where they were now... in an Alabama hospital with James Harper Senior needing surgery to do what had essentially been recommended in Moon Lake. Technically the insurance company hadn&#39;t fully cleared it, but it had now reached enough of an emergency that the insurance company&#39;s point was no longer valid.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t blow it, did I&quot; Elizabeth asked to James Junior, &quot;I mean... he could die and I&#39;d be left alone and with little...&quot;<br />
<br />
James Junior was quiet and had little real answer. He&#39;d have some of the same worries, as he&#39;d have some of the same weaknesses as Elizabeth did. His fiancée might accept him moving in with her to finish out their college time, at least with regard to things outside of the small community college they attended. However, he doubted they would be able to support his mother as well, particularly as she was likely looking to get her own life started again after years of being held down by James Senior. It was a situation where despite all his flaws and problems, they had to hope that James Senior lived, if only to try and fix things in the future, something which James Junior had tried to do but had failed at, which had largely been why he&#39;d supported Jenny&#39;s decision to see to it that Janice and John were cared for.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would say this was more dad&#39;s doing than you,&quot; James Junior sighed, &quot;he&#39;s done a lot of things to keep himself at the top of just about everything... and it&#39;s served to drive people away. Jenny to to Moon Lake, where she can now look after John and Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth nodded and accepted that much, &quot;but I could have NOT forced things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he could have doubled down on things,&quot; James Junior answered, &quot;it&#39;s been pretty rare that he ever backed out of anything and often because he&#39;s gotten away with it in the past. And while having it turn into this wasn&#39;t good... to a degree, it&#39;s probably necessary. It might be something that finally gets him to change his ways... and treat you better, because he has no other option.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth could only nod and took James Junior&#39;s offered hand and squeezed it. It wasn&#39;t something that held any hostility or anything that would have been the sort of submissive woman that Elizabeth had always been, even if there were times when it seemed like she&#39;d also passed that loyalty onto James Junior. There was a degree of worry there, which had to mean self-doubt and something that would indicate that Elizabeth Harper was actually thinking for herself, something that James Junior felt would go a long way to helping her, which would be critical as in time, Elizabeth would have to stand on her own against James Senior. For Janice and John were now in Moon Lake with their elder sister and the family she&#39;d married into... There was also the Anderson family, who had privately offered Jenny  a sort of adoptive family connections, but James Junior didn&#39;t know that. James also knew that after they graduated from college, his fiancée looked to work for one of the local school districts in Mississippi and he would take the skills he&#39;d picked up at computer repair and would try to open a business of that nature there. It would mean that Elizabeth would have to handle things on her own.<br />
<br />
They were there for a few moments, before a lone woman wearing blue scrubs approached them. The &quot;uniform,&quot;  had a pocket on her left  side the shirt from which hung a name tag that had the woman&#39;s face and the words &quot;Tiffany Granger, Nurse - Cardiology&quot; on it. She approached the two quietly, though James Junior turned at hearing the approaching footsteps. Elizabeth turned her head when James Junior looked up and caught sight of the approaching nurse as well. Both had a few moments of fear as Nurse Granger approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Harper,&quot; Nurse Granger said calmly as she approached with her focus to Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is my oldest son, James Junior,&quot; Elizabeth introduced James to her and tried to give an implication that she would be fine with the nurse also sharing information with James Junior as well. Though the attempt barely raised anything more than a nod from the nurse. When no other answer came, Elizabeth then brought about the question that was truly on her mind at present, &quot;How is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In general, Mrs. Harper, your husband is not in good condition, and based on the scans and imagery we have... there is a lot that he&#39;s probably needed before now,&quot; Nurse Granger spoke, &quot;and from medical history reports, it would appear that he&#39;s recently had a similar ER visit to a hospital in Washington state...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;he had a heart attack at our daughter&#39;s wedding and had to be treated there for a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did the hospital inform you of procedures that would be needed regarding his heart valves and the other related issues that have contributed to these problems?&quot; Nurse Granger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but our insurance company wouldn&#39;t pay for it until we got a second opinion,&quot; Elizabeth explained, &quot;so... the hospital in Moon Lake did enough to stabilize him from the heart attack there but not much more than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There were some preliminary appointments scheduled to get that opinion here as well,&quot; James Junior added, &quot;though... this emergency preempted that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nurse Granger nodded in agreement, &quot;Yes. His condition is such that tests and opinions are too late. If your insurance raises the question, we can argue that the &quot;second opinion&quot; was given on the basis of the emergency.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good... but how is he?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given things... about as good as can be hoped for,&quot; Nurse Granger answered, &quot;it&#39;s taken a little bit of work, but our chief surgeons are in today and have been able to push some less critical work back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you were able to get him into surgery?&quot; James Junior answered as Elizabeth leaned into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;They just took him a few moments ago,&quot; Nurse Granger replied, &quot;we are very confident that he will make it through, Mrs. Harper... though, this will take a few hours to do and we won&#39;t allow for visitation until tomorrow. How long he would stay here in the hospital in recovery would then depend on how he responds to the surgery. It could be a few days... it could be a week, just to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re sure he&#39;ll be fine?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mrs. Harper,&quot; Nurse Granger nodded, &quot;but the situation is such that it may be best that you and your son go home for now. We have your number on file and we can call you when he&#39;s come out of surgery and you can come visit him tomorrow during regular visiting hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he say anything...?&quot; Elizabeth wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not, Mrs. Harper,&quot; Nurse Granger answered, &quot;we&#39;ve tried to keep him sedated and with as much help as we can while getting him into surgery. I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s all we can do and all I can tell you at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you,&quot; James Junior spoke as he helped Elizabeth up, &quot;come on, mom... we&#39;ll be back tomorrow.&quot;</p>
