<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You proceeded to follow Rowan further into the castle, and while doing so Rowan began explaining to you a few things. &quot;Gannoth, do you know why exactly you shouldn&#39;t betray me?&quot; Rowan asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I am your familiar, and you are my immortal master, who has the power to give me punishments worse than death. As you said yourself master.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes yes, but do you know how?&quot; Rowan asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic?&quot; You responded puzzled <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you haven&#39;t a clue how powerful I actually am compared to you. Imagine that I am your planets ocean, and you are a meer drop of the water that flows through me, or at least you are now.&quot; Rowan said <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just so hard for me to process everything that just happened all at once, between my human life and this one it&#39;s kind of hard to comprehend master.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
Rowan sighed,&quot;Gannoth forget about your previous life, and know that you serve me eternally. You know I can erase your memories too, that is if you would like that, or if you need to adapt.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry Master it&#39;s just I don&#39;t know much about being a dragon yet. I just need to follow my instincts correct?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly yes, but you aren&#39;t as large as most dragons are, and your body is that of a minor sized dragon, who is seen as pitiful to major sized dragons. Just make sure your loyalty is to me, and only me Gannoth.&quot; Rowan said <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course master, I am as a pebble, as you are a mountain, in terms of magical strength.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
Rowan lead you to a library filled with books, and ancient scrolls that seemed to be either seemed kind of old, or corrupted by a dark shadow. &quot;Your training will have to wait Gannoth, as you said you know nothing about being what you are so take your vast draconic intellect, and study what you need. Wether it&#39;s dragons, language, me, your magic whatever you desire as far as knowledge. Your mind is adapting quite interestingly too, you want knowledge too just as your mind craves it. If you serve me well then you may just share my immortality at your prime, or I may summon another familiar to be your mate.&quot; Rowan said.<br />
<br />
The thought of being immortal was interesting, but the thought of having a mate was almost intoxicating for your instincts. &quot;Yes, of course master I hope that I please you eternally.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Unlikely, but do your maximum best anyways, but don&#39;t try too hard.&quot; Rowan said as a dark portal appeared before him, and he entered it. &quot;I will return when needed Gannoth.&quot; Rowan said before disappearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank god,&quot; you thought after your master disappeared. You were trying to hide your boner at the thought of having a mate, and you looked down to see you had TWO erect penises. You stared at your cocks for a with wonder, and both had to at least be 1 foot long too. You then shook your head, and felt your dicks fall back into a sheath,&quot;There&#39;s certainly a lot I need to learn.&quot; You said to yourself as you browsed the bookshelves.<br />
<br />
You figured out that the books were categorized by species, and there were a lot of mythical creatures, and mysterious ones too. You eventually found the section on dragons, and then a subsection on minor dragons, and there were about 42 books that seemed like textbooks that all were on dragons. &quot;God damn it I get out of school permanently, and now I have to study more now then I did then. Guess this is kind of what college would be like if I was in one.&quot; You thought and sighed.<br />
<br />
You opened up a book starting with dragon biology, and began reading expectations for it to be boring, but surprisingly it seemed rather interesting especially when it got into male and female differences. You finished the book surprisingly not expecting to get halfway into it, and what&#39;s more is you retained everything you read once as if you studied it 27 times. You then began reading the next book which was about possible dragon flame elements and magical potentials of minor dragons. Surprisingly enough minor dragons have a much larger potential than major dragons due to their intellect apparently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?&quot; You thought after reading it, and you read on and the book stated that major dragons are bold, and some rely on primal instincts especially the females, and the book described them as brood mothers who live for sex, and egg laying. You thought about that for a few seconds, but then stopped once you popped yet another double boner, and figured minor dragons didn&#39;t have similar issues. You continued reading, and you eventually got through all of the textbooks, and what&#39;s more is that everything you read was retained in your mind, and you could recall everything back to the first dragon biology book you read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, what now Gannoth what now?&quot; You said to yourself pacing, and then found a dark magic section of books. However when you opened a book it was in a language you couldn&#39;t begin to understand, and you growled slightly angered and frustrated by that. Then you realized something and thought to yourself,&quot;Wait am I actually frustrated by my lack of knowledge, and my inability to find a proper book to read?&quot;<br />
<br />
You guess you did, and wondered how the world outside was like in the dragon community. You then found a completely new dragon section that seemed to be for younger dragons almost, or teach er manuals. However there were quite a number of books you ended up taking out of there too embarrassingly enough. These books include a dictionary from English to draconic, a small textbook on how to fly, and several other books that involved the study of draconic languages. You then began reading beginning with the flying manual thinking to yourself,&quot;How embarrassing for me being a teenage dragon who can&#39;t fly, and then I am going to learn my own language as if I was a kindergarten student, yay.&quot; You thought to yourself sarcastically,&quot;I hope someone doesn&#39;t see me like this.&quot; You said aloud to yourself.<br />
<br />
You then paused and thought,&quot;Wait this is a castle, and my master is like a dark lord right? Where&#39;s his subjects, or worshippers, or slaves or something? Am I seriously the only being who serves master Rowan?&quot; You wondered, and then shrugged. You figured you would ask him later, but then you began to feel a bit hungry all of a sudden, and you had the urges to hunt. &quot;Damn, this would be a great time for master to return, God I am starving.&quot; It was then something happened that seemed to partially trigger your senses. You saw a raccoon in the hallway, and your primal urges to hunt flared within your bones. You followed your instincts and ended up killing and devouring the raccoon leaving little to no evidence of your feast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god that just happened...oh well I am a dragon, and I need to survive somehow.&quot; You thought as you continued reading. It was then master returned, and looked to you,&quot;Gannoth I assume your studies are going well thanks to your form.&quot; Rowan said <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, I uh actually pulled out some other books from the younger section after I finished with the main books I read on the shelf. If you master I am fairly new, and have, or had no knowledge of flight, or language of my kind.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;I expected as much, so you already read how many books?&quot; Rowan asked<br />
<br />
&quot;About 46 books including the ones on the table, and the language and flight books master.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now you may return to your studies later, for now you must rest in your quarters for dusk has fallen, and have you slept at all?&quot; Rowan asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No master, is that bad?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, I left you 65 hours ago, and dragons usually wait 54 before going to sleep.&quot; Rowan said <br />
<br />
&quot;I have been here for over 2 days studying? I had no idea it only felt like about 5 maybe 6 hours at most.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, but dragons do age slowly, and therefore experience time faster than most beings. That&#39;s how it was speculated at least, so follow me and get some sleep Gannoth.&quot; Rowan said <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master, as you say.&quot; You said following Rowan again. Rowan lead you to...</p>
