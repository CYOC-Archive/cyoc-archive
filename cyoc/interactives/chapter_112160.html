<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben soon learned quickly that there was more to being a bus boy at Grrrrrrr. Having to double as a waiter along with the two were otters; both looking at the large werewolf before them with a measure of suspicion. Despite doing their best to whisper, Ben picked up on them both betting as to how long he will last. Growling that they could feel such disdain for him as it is technically his first “shift”. It only made him redouble his efforts as he bussed the tables in between acting as a waiter.<br />
<br />

<br />
Frances Twist was busy finishing up her notes and current assessment of Benton Knight when noon rolled around. Somewhat thankful that he came earlier then his scheduled time; Frances was planning to join Samantha at city hall as she announced her plan to officially run for mayor. Frances knew that she would have missed the announcement if Benton showed up at eleven. With his session running longer than planned, after unloading his current issues; seeing the shredded remains of the punching bag, after she help Rudy clean up the mess afterwards, thankful that it was only the bag that got demolished. The last time Benton was mad while in her office, he punched a hole in the wall clear across to the waiting room. It gave both her and Rudy such a fright as a black furred paw was inches from the assistant’s head as he was putting away some files at the time. It was the closest Benton ever came to being charged with statue 1A violation. Even he was apologetic when that happened. Staring at the spot on the wall where the hole once was; Frances had to admit, that Benton’s preferred contractors did a bang up job repairing the damage. You wouldn’t have ever known that there was a hole punched through at one time.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of her office; Frances was surprised to see her father just entering, surprising both her and Rudy.<br />
“Rudy,” Frances sighing; “what is my afternoon like?”<br />
“You only have one patient at four in the afternoon,” Rudy looking at the schedule; “you wanted to keep most of the afternoon free in case your last patient took as long as last time.”<br />
“That’s right,” Frances remembering some of the marathon sessions with Benton Knight in the past; “if I’m not back by three, three-thirty, call the patient to reschedule and then close up for the day afterwards.”<br />
“Very well doctor,” Rudy knowing full well what Frances meant.<br />
<br />
Frances sighed as she left her practice with her father in tow as she heads to the elevator.<br />
“Any particular reason as to why you are here,” Frances looking at her father.<br />
“I was hoping,” Joseph answering; “that we could have lunch together. I have something… very important to tell you.”<br />
“I was planning on heading to city hall,” Frances sighing; “Samantha is planning to announce her candidacy for mayor.”<br />
“Oh,” Joseph looking glum; “I just thought… you’d want to spend time with your father.”<br />
“Look dad,” France already feeling exasperated; “I do want us to be together, but to show up out of the blue after…”<br />
“I don’t want to be alone right now,” Joseph crying and hugging his daughter; surprising the therapist and were-feline. “The cancer came back for your mother,” Joseph crying; “this time in her pancreas.”<br />
“No,” Frances looking horrified; “when did this happen?”<br />
“We found out this morning,” Joseph blubbering; “it came up after a routine checkup. Abigail was complaining of some abdominal pain last week. They took some pictures in the MRI…”<br />
“Does Samson know,” Frances doing her best to hold back the tears; “have you told him?”<br />
“Not yet,” Joseph crying; “oh god Frances, I’m going to lose Angelica.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
So far Ben was doing his best in regards to cleaning up the tables, washing dishes and even acting as a waiter. Growling and outright frightening the two were-otters as they continue to snicker at him. Calling him a mongrel dog; he nearly bit their heads off after that comment. He would have been fired, if it wasn’t for the owner overhearing the were-otters tormenting the new help and letting them know if they make one more crack regarding the new help, he would be finding replacements for them.<br />
<br />
Heading back onto the floor he found three werewolves entering into the restaurant. Escorting them to a nearby table and explaining how Grrrrrrr operates and what the meal is for the day. Taking their order for bottles of soda water and grapefruit juice, he heads back to the kitchen to inform them of a table for three; all werewolves. Heading back with their drink orders; Ben overhears them speaking in low tones. Despite them speaking in a foreign language so no one could understand them, they still tried to keep their conversation hush hush.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“God dam,” Alex yawning as he stretches; his back and arms sore from the sod he and Nate just laid down, “never again Nate. That was just too much for this werewolf.”<br />
“Come on,” Nate putting the tools back in his truck; “it wasn’t that bad. Besides,” Nate responding; “that’s the easy bit. It’s the paperwork that comes afterwards that is the real bitch for this job.”<br />
“Glad I don’t have to do that,” Alex collecting his shirt and climbing in the truck; “so my paycheck is part of it?”<br />
“That,” Nate looking at some numbers in a binder; “and I just hope there is a finance course available when school starts Tuesday. I need to learn how to do this accounting shit better. Hell,” Looking at Alex; “with the federal taxes and employment insurance shit that I have to do, I’m probably going to get us both audited by the IRS come next tax season.”<br />
“Oh joy,” Alex looking like he swallowed a rotten egg; “I can’t wait for that.”<br />
“Come on,” Nate starting up the truck; “let’s head home.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Frances was with her father at the hospital; seeing her mother in a hospital gown sitting on an exam table as she sighed. Angelica had a full hysterectomy to remove ovarian cancer last December. It was this revelation that forced the Carter family to start dealing with their issues. Primarily Joseph’s religious zeal. With Angelica recovering in the hospital and putting a damper on Samson’s wish for the family to be together for Christmas; the family was trying to work things out for a possible thanksgiving feast for the first time in years.<br />
“At least this time,” Frances looks at her mother; “I wasn’t given the news of your condition from Samson over poutine.”<br />
“Oh my baby girl,” Angelica speaking; “give your mother a hug.”<br />
“Is it bad,” joseph speaking.<br />
“Has cancer ever been good,” Frances speaking.<br />
“It’s brought us together,” Angelica sighing; “but I’m afraid this one is not good. My doctor told me that pancreatic cancer is rarely survivable,” Angelica putting on a brave front; “Even with chemo and radiation, I’ve been given six months at the most.”<br />
“Mom,” Frances crying; “don’t say it please. I finally got you back, I don’t want to lose you again.”<br />
“We still have time,” Angelica wiping her daughters tears away; “I’m not dead yet and I’m not going to spend any more time at this hospital. Joseph,” Angelica looking at her husband; “go sniff out Samson you old were-bloodhound. I want us to have a family meal together.”<br />
“So where do you want to have lunch then,” Frances speaking.<br />
“Some place expensive,” Angelica watching her husband groan as he calls up Samson.<br />
“I know of a place,” Frances answering; “Samantha and I went there during the Christmas holidays. Hope you like dining in your fursona mom we are going to Grrrrrrr.”<br />
“Just us,” Angelica speaking; “The Carter family only.”</p>
