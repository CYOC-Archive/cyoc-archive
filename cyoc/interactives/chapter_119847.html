<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriel looked up and saw a blue scaled male dragon who looked like he was interested in the scenery. The dragon was wandering around until he saw Gabriel awake, and he walked up to her. &quot;Greetings miss, I hope that I didn&#39;t startle you at all.&quot; The dragon said sitting down on his haunches in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I uh...when did you arrive here exactly?&quot; Gabriel asked blushing feeling attracted to this dragon thanks to her new instincts, and she was disgusted with herself for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;About a four, maybe five hours ago. This place seemed deserted so I wandered in seeing if I could possibly scavenge any leftovers from the previous locals. Then I saw you sleeping and your scales seemed softer in your more....vulnerable areas, so I decided to kind of guard you while I looked around. I didn&#39;t take anything I swear, everything here is yours right?&quot; The dragon asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I actually don&#39;t claim ownership to anything here. I&#39;m just.....using this place temporarily.&quot; Gabriel said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so you don&#39;t have a cave? I mean if those scorch marks are any indication then you or someone else had a fight here. You don&#39;t seem to have any armor either to protect your scales with, so I guess that I was just concerned about you.&quot; The dragon said blushing <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I uh....I manage with what I can use.&quot; Gabriel said getting up and sitting back on her haunches.<br />
<br />
The dragon paused seeing Gabriel&#39;s boobs in their full glory as they jiggled whenever she moved. The dragon blushed and Gabriel could see that two erect reptilian cocks emerged from the dragon&#39;s pelvis sheath. Gabriel blushed feeling aroused by the dragon&#39;s cocks, but soon after the dragon realized what happened and swiftly covered his pelvis with his wings embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I am so so sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to get aroused like that and offend you miss. J...just please forget about this, and I&#39;ll be off.&quot; The dragon said his face turning red under his scales and his head turning purple from his embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...no, I&#39;m just....it&#39;s....pffft.....hahahaha!&quot; Gabriel said as she began laughing and rolled onto her back laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...what&#39;s so funny?&quot; The dragon asked his facial scales still purple with embarrassment <br />
<br />
&quot;Your face is purple, because you are blushing! I&#39;m sorry, I really am, but this is the best I&#39;ve felt since I&#39;ve been like this.&quot; Gabriel said<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?! Seriously, what the hell is going on!?&quot; The dragon asked<br />
<br />
Gabriel sat up on her haunches once more and caught her breath,&quot;Okay okay, sorry I&#39;ve had my laugh. It&#39;s just funny that your scales changed colors when you blushed.&quot; Gabriel said wiping a tear from her eye using her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...you aren&#39;t the first, I guess. My name is Unix by the way, and and you are...&quot; the dragon, Unix said then sighed<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabriel, so what&#39;s your story?&quot; Gabriel asked unprepared for what she just triggered <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just a regular dragon trying to make it in this world. I have a decent treasure hoard, and humans come from time to time and most times I&#39;m generous with them. I basically do requests for them like destroying bandit camps, or donating some of my treasure from time to time, as long as it isn&#39;t much. So how about you? So how did you get cursed?&quot; Unix asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?! How did you know about that?!&quot; Gabriel asked blushing <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not everyday that someone finds a lone dragoness whose body is highly suited for attention in an abandoned castle, all alone, with no hoard, minions, or mate. Also I can smell that a human was here, and that circle burned into the floor is a large indication of magic, and recent because it&#39;s still warm.&quot; Unix said<br />
<br />
Gabriel was shocked that he knew all of this, but the evidence he presented lines up perfectly, and his scent was a bit captivating to her now that she was female. &quot;Well....if I tell you, promise never to tell anyone else about this, and please believe me.&quot; Gabriel said<br />
<br />
&quot;Considering humans and their magic, I&#39;d believe most things.&quot; Unix chuckled<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I told you that I was a male human, and that I&#39;ve only been like this for about one night.&quot; Gabriel said and Unix looked up at her shocked<br />
<br />
&quot;Um....well....that&#39;s certainly not the first claim that I&#39;ve heard of. By all means please continue though, you&#39;ve got my attention.&quot; Unix said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well basically there&#39;s this dark lord named Tramorn, and I was on a quest to kill him. I figured out that he was here and I came to do just that, but considering that we&#39;re here like this now you can see how that turned out. I only was able to get in a single blow on his body, and although it wounded him, he immediately countered by knocking me back and turning me into this. That circle is where I was when I transformed.&quot; Gabriel explained then sighed turning her back to Unix and hit her head against the wall, and she began tearing up.<br />
<br />
There was a long pause before Unix walked up and wiped the tear from Gabriel&#39;s cheek. Gabriel looked up and saw Unix smiling at her. &quot;Gabriel that&#39;s incredible, you were actually human, and you were a male one too.&quot; Unix said smiling<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem too thrilled about what I just told you.&quot; Gabriel said<br />
<br />
&quot;No...look...it&#39;s just...I love humans.&quot; Unix said and Gabriel paused looking at him shocked<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?!&quot; Gabriel asked <br />
<br />
&quot;I love humans, I mean they&#39;re the only other sentient beings that I&#39;ve met. Well, the only sentient beings that experience the same emotions as dragons do, I&#39;ll never devour any humans or harm one if they&#39;re friendly, I also them and ask them what it&#39;s like.&quot; Unix said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...you still seem oddly thrilled by this.&quot; Gabriel commented<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course I am, this is the first time that I&#39;ve met someone like you. You also know what it&#39;s like to be a male human, so that&#39;s great. Whenever a male human comes up to me it&#39;s either a request and I&#39;ll be polite and not ask, or they curse at me with all sorts of insulting phrases and try to kill me with little metal sticks. Females are nice though, and I was actually given a princess one time. At first she was afraid, but then I let her roam around my cave and explained my morals to her, and not long after she explained everything to the knight that showed up to slay me. Actually that&#39;s the reason why I get requests from humans.&quot; Unix said<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean swords, or spears, or whatever counts as a weapon basically.&quot; Gabriel said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah those, they even sometimes wear armor on their body like us dragons, but so much more often than us. So how does it feel, you know as a dragoness as opposed to being human?&quot; Unix asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I don&#39;t know how to answer that. I guess the extra weight up top is a bit disorienting, and my breasts feel so weird and uncomfortable. I just...I can&#39;t stand this right now.&quot; Gabriel said<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, I have an idea, but you&#39;ll have to bear with me on this.&quot; Unix said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what is it?&quot; Gabriel asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wanted know it you are willing to become my mate?&quot; Unix asked awkwardly sweating<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Gabriel asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, hear me out. You were probably one of those knights who think that we dragons are brutes. But we&#39;re so much more than that, and I want to teach you everything about being a dragon. Also, I wouldn&#39;t want you to get attacked by a large group of humans, or a dragon whose territory that you trespass in accidentally. I mean the only time when that&#39;s permitted is during mating season, and that just ended. That and dragonesses with bodies like yours usually end up in a harem, or worse a brood!&quot; Unix said stressing the word brood.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a brood?&quot; Gabriel asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you don&#39;t know what a brood is?&quot; Unix asked and she shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, picture this. A brood roughly about 4-7 dragonesses but the numbers can be much larger. Each dragoness will get fucked by an alpha male and lay their clutches naturally, except after one clutch is layed they get fucked again, and again. Essentially each dragoness spends her entire existence of about 90 million years breeding with the same male relentlessly until she can&#39;t make eggs anymore. I&#39;ve heard stories of brood offspring being turned into an army. But broods are terrible, and almost always result in roughly 50,000 siblings depending on how many dragonesses are involved.&quot; Unix explained and Gabriel shuddered at the thought of laying large amounts of eggs from her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s going to haunt my dreams for awhile.&quot; Gabriel said<br />
<br />
&quot;Those dragons are the true beasts. But seriously, I won&#39;t force any of that on you, and if we become mates then you will be my one and only mate. I will never force pregnancy on you...sex however is kind of a mandatory tradition to make things official.&quot; Unix said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh....what?! But what about everything you just said!?&quot; Gabriel asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s the most effective method. Nothing is less attractive than either a male with the scent of a female or a female with a male&#39;s scent. Our scents are generated through our hormones, and our....well genitalia hold most of our bodies sexual juices, and those are the only way to leave a strong scent. So please, avoid the risk of becoming a brood mother or a harem slave, if you don&#39;t want to fuck after we traditionally become mates and you get pregnant good, if you don&#39;t want to get fucked and you don&#39;t get pregnant then great for you. But I for one want to pass on my teachings to my offspring and push towards human alliances in my family rather than conflict, and is we don&#39;t fuck at all then you will be putting yourself at risk more than anything. So please heed my words, and choose carefully.&quot; Unix said<br />
<br />
Gabriel stopped to think, the traditions did sound crude, but it definitely sounded better than a harem or what a brood was based on what Unix said. Gabriel also secretly felt like she always wanted to have children, but she was a dragon and female so she would have to lay eggs, and would risk that right away by becoming Unix&#39;s mate. But then again the thought of motherhood somehow brought comforting thoughts to her in her mind. Gabriel then looked to Unix and she...</p>
