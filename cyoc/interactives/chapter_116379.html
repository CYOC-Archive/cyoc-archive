<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We’ll talk here while your mother and Helen chat in the kitchen,” Leon speaking to his son Peter. The two in one of the restoration garages; currently occupied by a rusted out Rolls Royce Phantom in the beginning stages of restoration. Peter looking at the hulk that came from a competing restoration shop on the east coast. Said shop biting off more than they can chew, called up Talbot Restoration to take over the project. Peter running his paw over a dented wheel well, looks at his father as he toys with a wrench that was left carelessly on a nearby table.<br />
<br />
“So what is it you wanted to talk about,” Peter speaking; his focus currently still on the classic car before him.<br />
“Dreams mostly,” Leon sighing; “a bit of it having to do with the future.”<br />
“Prophecy dreams,” Peter turning to look at his father; “you had one?”<br />
“One for sure,” Leon tossing the wrench aside; “it predicted my death and I’d rather not go into detail with it. Suffice to say,” Leon holding up a hand to stop his son from speaking; “I had the good sense to heed it, when Frederick Parker made his move today.”<br />
“Made his move,” Peter looking confused; “what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Leon pauses with a breath before explaining how Frederick Parker attacked the jail; attempting to break his son Daniel Parker out of jail. Peter growled upon hearing the name of the man that shot him Friday evening; all for his ’66 mustang that now lies in ruins. Snorting in mild amusement, when Leon mentioned how the sheriff had Daniel transferred out of town.<br />
“In the trunk of a state trooper’s cruiser,” Peter shaking his head; “isn’t that a violation of rights or something?”<br />
“Yeah,” Leon answering dismissively; “but its Daniel’s word against a state trooper and an FBI agent. Who is going to believe him?”<br />
“Fair point,” Peter responding; “and now the shark is in jail?”<br />
“No lawyer will get him off on trying to murder nearly the town’s entire police force,” Leon stating; “but that is not why I wanted to have a chat with you.”<br />
“Then what is it,” Peter looking at his father.”<br />
“Helen,” Leon looking at his son.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Helen,” Regina looking at the small woman before her; turning her head slightly as the sound of Jean and Nate’s rutting could be heard through the walls.<br />
“Whether you approve of me or not,” Helen staring at the were-lioness in front of her; “matters not. Peter and I,” Helen giving a laissez-faire look; “are mates.”<br />
“It does matter,” Regina looking stone faced at the were-rabbit; “Peter is the prince of the were-lion pride. He is next in line to be the king,” Regina espousing; “you don’t realize how desirable he is to the single were-lionesses.”<br />
“Peter has told me,” Helen rolling his eyes; “all they see of him as a stepping stone to being queen. That is why they fawn over your son,” Helen smirking; “they love his title and status, but not him. Me, I could care less of such titles. I already have on,” Helen looking serious; “and it’s Doctor.”<br />
<br />
Regina eyes go wide upon hearing what Helen just said; the thought of her son nothing more than a tool for some ambitious were-lioness was not lost on her. It was the casual way in which it was brought up that floored the woman.<br />
“You can look stunned all you want,” Helen observing Regina; “it is the truth. At least what Peter has confided in me,” Helen quickly adding.<br />
“You said Peter made some vow to you last night,” Regina wanting to change the conversation; “that this vow is what effectively started a were-wedding between the two of you.”<br />
“I wouldn’t say start,” Helen commenting; “but it was a big part of the… event.”<br />
“You say event with some difficulty,” Regina speaking; “why is that?”<br />
“Because I was taking the wrong were-birth control pills,” Helen sighing; “it put me in state in which I wasn’t in complete control.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you mention this to me sooner,” Peter looking at his father.<br />
“I wasn’t sure what to make of it,” Leon shaking his head; “to be told by the same draconic man that kept you from dying, that the pride will look at you taking a were-rabbit for a mate as a sign of weakness…”<br />
“Bullshit,” Peter growling; “they will see how strong I can be.”<br />
“Not if I step down,” Leon stating sadly; “you would need to challenge me for leadership if you want to be king.”<br />
“Assuming I want that title,” Peter grumbling; “and its responsibilities.”<br />
“Heavy is the head that wears the crown” Leon speaking; “if it isn’t you, it will be one of my brothers or nephews. None have the temperament to lead, unlike you.”<br />
“Your still assuming,” Peter speaking; “that Helen will not be accepted as an honorary member of the pride. Her being my mate and all.”<br />
“It’s not a question of that,” Leon responding; “it’s accepting her as the queen.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“The dream I had last night,” Helen shivering; “of being hunted by a were-lioness and watching that were-lioness get killed by Peter. That was before he made his promise to me,” Helen looking at Regina; “after a brief struggle with him in the safe room, Peter made a really interesting comment that completely threw me off guard.”<br />
“I’ll bite,” Regina listening to Helen talk; “what did Peter say to you last night.”<br />
“That tiny pink nose at the end of your muzzle, is your best feature; I enjoy seeing it constantly twitch, “Helen repeating what Peter said; “I wasn’t expecting that from a large were-lion.”<br />
<br />
Regina couldn’t help but laugh as she heard what Helen just said. Helen letting her continue to laugh before continuing what happened last night.<br />
“It was then he started saying all the right things while,” Helen pausing; “getting very intimate with me. Without giving you a blow by blow what was said and… done,” Helen not wanting to get explicit; “it was than he made his promise to protect me.”<br />
<br />
Before Regina could respond further; a load roar could be heard followed by a wolfish howl. Both sounds giving Helen a pang of fear; yet seeing Peter enter the kitchen made Helen feel less fearful.<br />
“Jean and Nate are obviously here,” Peter sitting next to Helen at the kitchen table; “Don’t those two ever stop?”<br />
“You could always ask them,” Leon looking at his wife Regina; “but don’t expect a civil answer from your sister Peter.”<br />
“Leon,” Regina shaking her head; “leave them be. Now that we are together,” Regina looking at her son in his were-lion fursona; “perhaps it’s time to celebrate with a family feast.”</p>
