<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob opened his phone and began to text Greg.<br />
<br />
Jacob: Hey man, can you do me a favor?<br />
<br />
Greg: Hey Jacob, this is Jake. Greg got in trouble for what he did a minute ago. He’s in time out and won’t keep his phone until he learns his lesson. But you can tell me what you need and I can do it.<br />
<br />
Jacob groaned. He couldn’t believe that his friend already got in trouble. He wondered what he did.<br />
<br />
Jacob: What did he do? Is he facing a corner right now?<br />
<br />
It took him a second, but Jacob received a photo from Greg. It was a picture of a little boy wearing a baby blue onesie with a baby bonnet and pacifier that were the same color. Greg looked like he was crying, and Jacob assumed he got spanked too.<br />
<br />
Greg: He tried to fight me while I was diapering him. I wouldn’t have cared if he didn’t bite me. <br />
<br />
Jacob: He bit you? <br />
<br />
Greg: Yea but I didn’t hurt. Luckily for us we were able to find baby stuff for him. I told him, “If you’re going to act like a baby, then be one” and he was dressed up after a quick spanking<br />
<br />
Jacob: Oh wow. <br />
<br />
Greg: Yup. So what did you need from him?<br />
<br />
Jacob: nothing, just wanted to know if he could bring me his charger. <br />
<br />
Greg: I can bring you his. Don’t worry!<br />
<br />
Jacob lied about the charger to avoid getting caught about wanting food. He got out of bed and grabbed his charger and looked around for a place to hide it. Without thinking, he put the charger under his bed.<br />
<br />
Jack came in holding a phone charger and another baby bottle of juice. “Hey bud, we’re you looking for your charger?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, I could have swore it was here!” Jacob was pretending to be looking where his charger was, seeing that it isn’t there.<br />
<br />
“Oh I guess you must have dropped it somewhere. Here, hold these while I look!” He handed Jacob the charger and bottle. Jack looked all around the room. When he got to the bed, he looked under and found it.<br />
<br />
He grabbed it and handed the charger to Jacob, “Here you go bud. Is that all you need?”<br />
<br />
Jacob took the charger and gave Greg’s charger back, “No, but I’m still hungry.” <br />
<br />
“No can do man, we need to see how you are with your liquids!”<br />
<br />
“But I finished my bottle. Shouldn’t that be enough?”<br />
<br />
“You finished it? Well it looks like Greg will have to wait for his bottle.”<br />
<br />
“His bottle? Are you gonna treat him like a complete baby?”<br />
<br />
“Yup! It teach him not to bite me next time!”<br />
<br />
“Yea. Could you ask Dian if I could have something to eat like yogurt. It doesn’t have to be physical food, just food.”<br />
<br />
“I see what I can do. Since you’ve drank all of your bottle, can you check your diaper for me?” Jack asked. Jacob wasn’t sure why he didn’t check it himself since he was the adult, but he did it anyways. <br />
<br />
In his diaper it looked pretty clean. He didn’t feel anything in his backside, plus his diaper’s designs weren’t faded. <br />
<br />
“All clean!” Jacob said.<br />
<br />
“Good boy! If you need anything, just call us!” Jack took the empty baby bottle and left the room. Jacob plugged in his charger and laid in bed as he watched cartoons and drank from the bottle. <br />
<br />
After a while, Jack returned with a bowl of cut up bananas and a small carton of applesauce. “Thankfully you haven’t puked yet, so Dian was nice enough to let you eat these for now. But there’s a catch.”<br />
<br />
“Catch?”<br />
<br />
“You have to eat downstairs, and she insists that you eat in front of her.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not bad!”<br />
<br />
“You’ll see what I mean.”<br />
<br />
Jake walked out of the room with Jacob close behind him. They walked to the kitchen where a high chair stood at the kitchen’s island. Jake placed the food on the high chair’s table and began to lift Jacob up. He placed him in the chair and buckled him in.<br />
<br />
“You know I don’t mind it, why did you buckle me in?” Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
“Because I wouldn’t be able to do this!” Dian used her phone and took many photos of Jacob. He began to shield his face, but that didn’t stop her.<br />
<br />
When she finished with the photos, she went through and showed them to Jacob. “Look at the little baby! He’s so adorable when he covers his face like that!”<br />
<br />
“Hey that’s not fair! You can’t take pictures of me!”<br />
<br />
“It’s either just you eating, or I take an entire album for everything you do. From waking up to bath time. Every moment of your baby life will be ok this phone for your mother to see.”<br />
<br />
“Fine, but can you not make it embarrassing!” Jacob grabbed the spoon and began to eat the applesauce. He could tell he was being recorded by Dian, so he tried to pay no mind to it. It was a normal meal, up until he accidentally spilt some applesauce on him.<br />
<br />
“Aw look at him! Jake could you clean the messy baby up!” Dian requested. Jake grabbed a wet rag and wiped the applesauce off of Jacob’s chest.<br />
<br />
When he finished the applesauce, Dian and Jack clapped and cheered for him as if he did something important.<br />
<br />
When he ate the bananas, Jacob just chewed on them with his hands. There wasn’t much to happen with that, but when he finished they cheered again.<br />
<br />
“Can you wave to the camera for your mommy!” Dian asked. <br />
<br />
Jacob began to blush. He covered his face with his arm and gave a little wave.<br />
<br />
“That is so adorable! Your little man is as cute as I remember!” Dian said. Jacob moved his arm and saw she wasn’t recording anymore. He was unbuckled and released from the chair. He stood on the floor as Jack handed him the same bottle as earlier, but with a different colored juice.<br />
<br />
“You can go lay down with Greg over there, or you can go back to your room.” Jack suggested. Jacob walked over to where he pointed, and saw a playpen made of high fences. It was pretty big compared to him, but he was able to see through the fences and see his friend. Dressed up in a onesie and baby bonnet while sucking on a pacifier, Greg slept peacefully while unaware of his friend watching him.</p>
