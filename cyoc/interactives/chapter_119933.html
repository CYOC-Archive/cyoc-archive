<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, someone&#39;s drawn first blood tonight.&quot; A coy voice snarked in the distance. It was Kellie, having now changed into newly acquired swimsuits with her friends. Katie looked to her now twin sister and smirked to herself, noticing a hint of jealousy from her. “No, it’s nothing like that Kel. Just hanging out with an old pal of mine. So, what were you guys talking about while I was away?” Kellie looked to her sister and said in a clear and understanding voice. &quot;Well, for starters, we managed to scrounge up a spare for you in case you got down and dirty like ya did...&quot; Kel handed her sister a strapless bikini and swimming boxers. &quot;Second, we might as well go on the prowl this one time for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls gathered to Kel&#39;s Car which went from being an old, raggedy Honda Civic to a sleek and cherry red Jaguar F-Type sports car with the wind blowing through their hair and two surfboards strapped to the back. It was one of the prizes they’ve won in a surfing competition and in Katie’s memory; it was the greatest prize of them all. This new sports car was definitely an improvement of the mom car Kellie used to drive. The pair then started walking on the beach for a good place to sit. Katie was having serious doubts about finding guys to hang out with. This morning, she was only a 7 year old girl and Kellie her 43 year old mother. Now they were twins of 18.5 years, on the edge of graduation and going to college. Katie wasn&#39;t quite sure if she and Kellie were identical twins. They did look very much alike. Both of them were beautiful young women with a toned athletic build and golden blonde hair going down to the middle of their backs. Even so, Katie was aware that beneath appearances, she was still a young girl with her mother. She wasn&#39;t certain if she could feel comfortable with them seeking out... Katie&#39;s doubtful thoughts trailed off as they walked over a dune and saw more of the beach. Plenty of other people had come to the beach on this day, families of different arrangements, groups of friends, solitary beach-goers. Katie could spot quite a few young men, wearing no shirts with their swim trunks. Some of them were fit, others were in pretty good shape. There was more than a handful of chiseled chests among them and the faces that went with them were reasonably handsome. Katie&#39;s adult hormones had been dormant up to that point, but her moment with Jake had caused quite the eruption.<br />
<br />
Kellie saw the excited look on Katie&#39;s face and said, &quot;Still think we have no time for guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it certainly couldn&#39;t hurt to look around,&quot; said Katie, the idea of meeting cute guys becoming more interesting to her, &quot;How about we divide and conquer. We&#39;ll split up and look around. If either of us see a guy with potential, we find each other and compare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a good plan,&quot; said Claudia, and the flock of women started walking in slightly different directions, Kellie walking closer to the short while Katie walking nearer to the dunes.<br />
<br />
Katie was becoming more aware of her adult body. Her breasts bounced slightly as she walked and her nipples were starting to stiffen a little. She could feel the sway in her hips as she moved. Obviously, she&#39;d be very hard to resist. However, the pickings were slimmer than she had expected. She had seen plenty of handsome guys, but every one of them either already had a girl on their arm or was looking after some kids that were presumably their younger relatives. The only other boys she could pick out where either obviously too young or way too old. How was she supposed to find available young men here?<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Katie remembered she still had the ring. It changed her and Kellie from a little girl and middle-aged mother to a pair of sexy young women. It could easily make handsome young men from the otherwise reject options. Kate looked among the younger beach-goers. Which one of these boys should she grow into dates for her and Kellie. Of course, the problem with that is the boys were most often with their families and Katie felt a little awkward with messing with other families like that. There has to be some boys that weren&#39;t so attached to other groups.<br />
<br />
Then Kate noticed someone coming down towards the beach. From a distance, she could tell that it was a teenage boy with light brown hair leading a younger boy with chestnut hair. The teenage boy was wearing orange shorts while the little boy was wearing blue. As they got closer, Kate recognized them. The little boy was Mike, her friend from back when she was 7 years old, that seemed so long ago now. The boy leading him was his older cousin Bobby. Even though it was another life, Katie could clearly remember the times when Bobby babysat the both of them and she and Mike played together. Now it seemed that Bobby just babysat Mike alone. But that was going to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Mike, keep moving,&quot; said Bobby as he led his younger cousin onto the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sand&#39;s too hot,&quot; whined Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it. We&#39;re almost there,&quot; said Bobby. He probably should have been gentler with Mike, but he was in a bit of a bad mood. He had paid good money for a magic ring and then he lost it. He was still kicking himself for being so careless. He was more than a little annoyed with his aunt asking him to take Mike to the beach for the afternoon, but at least their would be bikini babes here. He just hoped that having his little cousin along won&#39;t keep them away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Kel. Hope you like my seconds.&quot; Lamented Kate as she silently made her wish. Bobby was changing slower because he was 16 and there weren&#39;t many years between that and his destination. Mike, being only 7, had further to go and was growing quicker. His strides became longer as his legs stretched, his arms keeping up with them. As his torso grew, his pudgy physique started to change, becoming leaner. His face was also becoming leaner as his cheeks became less plump. &quot;The water looks great today,&quot; said a 10 year old Mike happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, nice day for a swim,&quot; said Bobby, already 17. He had gotten a few more inches in height and his chest firmed slightly. It was a great day to be on the beach, there ought to be plenty of girls to see. He trusted his kid cousin to stay out of the way so he shouldn&#39;t have trouble getting a girl&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s change in height started to pick up. His baby fat was sucked away, leaving a rather gangling appearance but that only happened for a moment. His thin torso started to thicken again, but this time with muscle. His chest started to flare to the sides as his shoulders started widening. His stomach was flat but now it started to gain a slight bit of texture. His limbs went from stringy to wirey as muscles started building up. His face was becoming more square as his chin started to stick out, his nose becoming less round and slightly longer. A 14 year old Mike hitched up his trunks which had a significantly less kiddy style to them. They tightened for a moment around him, particularly his larger package before adjusting to fit. &quot;You think there are gonna be girls here?&quot; asked Mike, his voice lower with the Adam&#39;s apple that just appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know so,&quot; said Bobby, now 18. He had grown another few inches, but that was mostly it. His body was fit, but it was not muscular. Bobby was a little embarrassed by his lack of muscles. Hopefully, he&#39;d be able to get some attention from girls who wouldn&#39;t be drooling over some musclebound oaf.<br />
<br />
Then the two of them had a surge in growth. Mike sprang up in height until he was actually a little taller than Bobby. The muscles that been building up before exploded outwards. His arms and legs became carved pillars of muscle as a little bit of dark hair appeared on them. His shoulders widened further giving his torso a gem-like shape. His pecs and abs grew larger until they were very clearly defined under his skin. His face finished maturing into rugged handsomeness as stubble started to appear on his broad cheeks. Meanwhile, Bobby looked like he had been put through an express workout session in an instant. His muscles bulged until they were equal in size to Mike&#39;s. He was a little shorter and his face wasn&#39;t as rugged as Mike&#39;s, but he had a softer dreamier quality that many women found attractive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, here comes one now,&quot; said Bobby as the changes continued.  She was gorgeous, a toned body, D-cup breasts, perfect hourglass figure, black bikini, golden hair, this babe&#39;s got it all. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Hey, two hunks here with anyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today,&quot; said Mike, eyeing her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, me, my buddies and especially my twin sister were looking for a pair of guys to have some fun with. You up for some fun in the sun?&quot; asked the college grad.<br />
<br />
This hot babe has a twin sister? How could Bobby possibly resist? &quot;Lead the way then,&quot; said Bobby. The girl smiled brightly and started walking back towards the shore, the cousins following her. Bobby&#39;s eyes went up and down the babe&#39;s body, her backside as sexy as her front. He also noticed a gold ring on one of her fingers.</p>
