<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna was asleep. <br />
<br />
Her eyes were closed with a frown over her angelic features. Suddenly gasped as if in shock and her eyes snapped open. Her mane of fiery red hair spread around her head like a halo from hell. She was sleeping in a double bed, in an apartment in Minsk. What had happened with the former Prince was in the past. But the proof of their 3 weeks of almost nightly fucking was evidenced by her swollen abdomen. She looked down at the bump that rose up like hill in what had been her perfectly trim stomach. Anna had known what her role was, mother of the new Romanov empire. But she was only understanding it now.<br />
<br />
Twins...she had joked about his passion, trying to get her knocked up more than once. But she had been right, he had been sexually frustrated and when she showed him his place the future of Russia. Well he fucked her with a power and strength as if he were stabbing his older and much hated brother William. Anna&#39;s place, Christ&#39;s plan for Russia, gave him a role, it gave him power and all old hatred churned in his balls, through his cock and into her unprotected pussy.   <br />
<br />
She had sworn not to buy new clothes, despite the future she was carrying she was on a budget. Anna wore white panties and a thin white sleeping tee that fitted her before her pregnancy. Her tits were the only thing that hadn&#39;t swollen or grown, her nipples had gone brown but size wise she was still a DD bust. They pushed their outlines into the fabric, the sheer material allowed anyone to see her big boobs. She tried to get up, but her bloated middle stopped her from doing it. She grunted with exertion, tits wobbling inside her tee. She rolled to her side, feeling like a beached whale. Her legs were still shapely but less defined with some cellulite, wheres once they had been wrapped around his body, now she would have to open her legs to give birth to his twins. At least his wife didn&#39;t know or forgave him.<br />
<br />
Anna should have been in Moscow in a palace but the false tsar was still in power and he would hunt her and her children like Herod had hunted and slaughtered children to find Christ. So Belarus was as close as she got to Egypt at this time. She rolled over, trying to sleep on her stomach but her belly stopped her from going further than her side. Swearing in Russian, she held her stomach and tried to roll over to the other side. Anna grunted with effort having to flick the hair out of her eyes. The panties she wore had ridden up the parting in her buttocks, she still had a great ass. But she had a bigger problem, make it two. The twins were now awake and kicking her from the inside! Why couldn&#39;t they stay fucking still, at times it felt like twins were beating her up from the inside, using her internal organs for practice. She under stood the horror of Alien movies now.<br />
<br />
Anna tried to move to the side of the bed, she thrashed with her unborn cargo like a toddler throwing a tantrum. Looking down she was the height of female sexuality, the valley between her two big knockers, the sexy messy bed hair, the long dancer&#39;s legs but then the bloated belly with the popped belly button that sloshed with the liquid inside her. Anna used those legs to drag her to the side of the bed until suddenly the mattress collapsed and she fell to all fours with a grunt, five know including her pregnant belly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck&quot; she moaned, flicking her head back to get the hair out of the way. She looked at her deep blue eyes and wondered if he would ever be with her? She needed a consort or something, she had to show their father was royalty that no one could ignore. But he had married that black bitch and had kids with her. The last time she had made love to him had been when she was three months pregnant and she was in Poland ready to cross the border with Belarus. She had had a bump then but it was manageable. She remembered their last night of fiery passion. <br />
<br />
She was sitting on Harold&#39;s lap, she had a belly but it nothing compared to news she had found out she was expecting twins, a boy and a girl. They had a room near the train tracks and a train was thudding down the tracks as they made love. At least this time she didn&#39;t have to worry about car fibers on her ass. She sat facing him, his cock already deep inside her folds. Her legs spread as she braced her body with a leg either side of his trunk. Her boobs were in his face but he didn&#39;t fondle them like last time. He looked her up and down like wanting to store this night in his memory. Her left hand draped over his shoulder, her right cupping his face. There was a tenderness in between them now he understood and more importantly believed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ugh&quot; she gasped, he was about to come.<br />
<br />
Her hands moved brace herself around his neck. Again he looked her up and down, now she was starting to sweat. <br />
<br />
&quot;AH-OOO!&quot; burst out her suddenly as her tits wobbled in time with his thrusts. <br />
<br />
She wrapped her legs around him like those of a spider, grasping her lover tightly, her boobs thrust into his face. She waited for him to come but he didn&#39;t. Moving with a speed she had never known from her one and only lover she had been flipped on to her back, still inside her he kept thrusting in her pussy. Her body racked with orgasms she was like a puppet on strings and he had completely control. He pounded her pussy as if it were their wedding night and he hadn&#39;t touched her before. <br />
<br />
&quot;OOFFF!&quot; she gasped as he cock swelled and he flooded her pussy with his seed, again. <br />
<br />
Panting and sweating she asked him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reminding my whore who their king is&quot; <br />
<br />
He lit a cigarette and declined to share it with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you are in Russia, remember who the father of your child is.&quot;</p>
