<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana led Jake out of the bar and toward her car. As she opened the door, she watched Luna taking Dylan into her own ride. The werewolf jock crawled into the back seat, followed by Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t expect me to be phenomenal,&quot; Jake cautioned as he and Diana stripped naked.<br />
<br />
Diana tried not to laugh at the irony. The greatest lover in the world could never satisfy her if he were male. &quot;No worries. Just follow my lead and you&#39;ll have fun. Here, you&#39;ll need this.&quot; She handed Jake a bottle of lube.<br />
<br />
Jake began lubing up his dick as soon as it was erect. &quot;H-How should we start?&quot; he asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just lie down and let me do most of the work,&quot; Diana suggested. Once Jake was lying prone, Diana climbed on top of him and lowered her pussy onto his dick. She began to gently pump herself up and down on it, her enormous muscles rippling as she exerted herself. &quot;So... how does <i>this</i> feel, Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels... nice,&quot; Jake said with a smile. &quot;REALLY nice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you like it,&quot; Diana smiled back at him. Sex with a boy wasn&#39;t doing much for her, but she was pleased to see that he was enjoying himself... particularly because she needed him to be in a good mood for what was about to come next. &quot;Okay, don&#39;t freak out over what I&#39;m about to do. I have a surprise for you, Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch,&quot; Diana said as she continued pumping her pussy up and down on Jake&#39;s dick. &quot;Look at my body. Your understanding of the world is about to change forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked carefully at Diana, paying close attention. Suddenly, Diana&#39;s thick, red body hair seemed to grow even thicker as she fucked him. Jake thought it was an optical illusion, but it soon got to be too much to ignore. Every inch of Diana&#39;s skin was covered in a pelt of red fur! At the same time, Diana&#39;s bones began to make a popping sound as her body gained two extra feet of height and her already bulging muscles swelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?!&quot; Jake gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all part of the fun, I promise!&quot; Diana pleaded. &quot;Just try to go with it.&quot; She closed her eyes and tried to think of her girlfriend Sylvie as she continued to ram Jake&#39;s throbbing cock inside her pussy. It wasn&#39;t quite enough to make the sex feel sexy, but made it feel a bit less gross to the lesbian werewolf.<br />
<br />
As Diana continued to shimmy up and down on Jake&#39;s cock, her changes continued. Her feet morphed into lupine paws while claws grew from her fingers. Her tits swelled up to massive size while smaller secondary pairs grew in beneath them. Mesmerized, Jake reached up to play with Diana&#39;s new tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you like these, do you?&quot; Diana laughed. Jake just wordlessly nodded as he flicked at Diana&#39;s extra nipples.<br />
<br />
Diana grunted as a furry tail erupted from her lower spine just above her ass. Her face then pushed out into a long lupine muzzle full of the sharp teeth of a predator. To cap off her transformation, Diana&#39;s ears became two velvety triangles. Diana had become a humanoid wolf right before Jake&#39;s wondering eyes!<br />
<br />
Just as Diana&#39;s wolfy transformation finished, Jake couldn&#39;t hold it anymore. His load blasted into Diana&#39;s pussy as he groaned in orgasmic satisfaction. Diana let out a lustful howl just to be polite. Alas, Jake&#39;s male body just couldn&#39;t bring her to orgasm. She didn&#39;t mind cock, but the boobless body behind it and the testosterone-deepened voice held no appeal for her. Oh well. At least she&#39;d done her duty to the pack. That was all that mattered right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; Jake gasped as he came down from his orgasm. &quot;That was so much more intense than jerking off.&quot; He stared at Diana, dumbfoundedly taking in Diana&#39;s lupine form. &quot;Are you really a...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A werewolf?&quot; Diana chuckled. &quot;Yeah, I am. My dad&#39;s the alpha of my pack, though some say Mom&#39;s the power behind the throne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves are real?!&quot; Jake marveled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are,&quot; Diana nodded. &quot;So are werecats. And werehyenas. And werelions. And werebears, And wereotters and wererabbits. And vampires, faeries, angels, demons, ghosts, dragons, centaurs, witches, unicorns, genies, merfolk, minotaurs, nagas, sphynxes, trolls, yokai, and a bunch of other stuff. You&#39;re basically living in an urban fantasy story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always did like that <i>Supernatural</i> TV series,&quot; Jake smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taking this pretty well,&quot; Diana remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the sex helped,&quot; Jake shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m basically flooded with endorphins, and your transformation was beyond hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s kinda <i>why</i> I asked you for a fuck,&quot; Diana confessed sheepishly. &quot;I&#39;m actually a lesbian. So&#39;s Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that makes sense,&quot; Jake sighed. &quot;Not too many straight girls in Stokerville. So, why have sex with me if you&#39;re a lesbian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just needed to get you and Dylan more receptive a pair of werewolves,&quot; Diana answered. &quot;Sorry we got so underhanded about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Receptive?&quot; Jake asked. &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom says our pack needs new members,&quot; Diana explained. &quot;She says our numbers need to grow to protect our territory, but there just aren&#39;t enough cubs being born on account of all the girls being lesbian as hell. So Mom asked me and Luna to go out and recruit new werewolves to the pack. To put it bluntly, wanna be a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked a bit anxious. &quot;Do you have to... bite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; Diana chuckled. &quot;A werewolf bite doesn&#39;t actually do anything but hurt. Mom&#39;s gonna transform you with a salve that you rub into your armpits and pubes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, better,&quot; Jake sighed in relief as he pulled on his clothes. &quot;That I can work with. You know what? I&#39;m in! I mean, you look impossibly cool! I&#39;ve... never really been all that cool.&quot; Jake blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll soon fix that,&quot; Diana smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll contact you when Mom&#39;s ready to transform you. She might wait until the next full moon to maximize the magic of the salve, or she might do it sooner. We&#39;ll see. Well, bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye,&quot; Jake said, smiling as he slid out of Diana&#39;s car. &quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d it go?&quot; Luna asked Diana as soon as they were alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprisingly well,&quot; Diana said. &quot;Jake&#39;s really excited to join the pack. What about Dylan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s thrilled to pieces,&quot; Luna answered. &quot;He&#39;s apparently a massive fan of horror movies and can&#39;t wait to be a real, live werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s two new recruits,&quot; Diana said. &quot;We need at least four.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Luna nodded. &quot;I say we...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna was suddenly interrupted by her ringtone. She whipped out her phone and saw that it was her mom calling. &quot;Hey, Mom?&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s the recruiting going?&quot; Artemis Lyall asked her eldest daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty well, Mom,&quot; Luna answered. &quot;We just got two brothers named Dylan and Jake Clancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two males, huh?&quot; Artemis mused, deep in thought. &quot;I suppose that&#39;s acceptable enough. Just remember, we already <i>have</i> a surplus of straight males in the pack. From now on, try to focus on getting some straight or bisexual girls to be their mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a tall order in Stokerville,&quot; Luna sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Artemis barked. &quot;Just do it! Our males need mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll try, Mom,&quot; Luna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Artemis said approvingly. &quot;Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Artemis hung up, Luna turned to Diana. &quot;Mom wants us to focus on recruiting girls. She says we need to find some guy-attracted girls for our pack&#39;s single dudes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In Stokerville?&quot; Diana said skeptically. &quot;Well, I guess there ARE some bi girls around. But won&#39;t that be poaching girls from Selena.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so long as we avoid girls she specifically wants,&quot; Luna shrugged. &quot;There&#39;s too many girls for one pack to monopolize the recruiting pool, and I somehow doubt Selena will mind if we leave her all the lesbians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then avoid Marley Roberts and Destiny Robbins,&quot; Diana said. &quot;Selena&#39;s been talking with them about joining her own pack. Also, you know Amber Mitchell-Erickson?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The coach of your school&#39;s girls basketball team?&quot; Luna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, her,&quot; Diana nodded. &quot;Well, Selena&#39;s in talks with her and her wife Brittany about joining the werehyena pack. That&#39;s two more people we need to consider off limits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; Luna said. &quot;Gotta give the werehyenas some respect, right? I literally owe Selena my body hair. Well, that still leaves lots of girls and women we can choose from. Hey, I&#39;ve got an idea! I&#39;m president of my sorority at the University of Seattle. Since the campus is in Seattle rather than Stokerville, most of my sorority sisters are straight or bi. A lot of them are abroad for Spring Break partying, but a few of them are still in Washington state. Want me to call them over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Diana mused. &quot;It might take them a while to make it to Stokerville from Seattle, and we need results fast if we want Mom off our fucking backs.&quot; Diana pulled idly at her arm hair as she pondered. &quot;Hey! How about the soccer team?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Mom said no more boys,&quot; Luna protested.<br />
<br />
Diana rolled her green eyes. &quot;The <i>girls&#39;</i> soccer team, dumbass. We&#39;ve got one of each, remember? And I know some hot bi girls on the team who would be all over our pack&#39;s single guys... and all over us, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does Selena want them?&quot; asked Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only three or four of them are bi,&quot; Diana explained. &quot;That still leaves a lot of lesbians for Selena.&quot; Diana&#39;s phone suddenly buzzed as a text came in. &quot;Well, whaddaya know?&quot; she laughed. &quot;I just got a text from Erin Masterson, the captain of the girls&#39; soccer team. Looks like she and her teammates are having a party at her house to celebrate beating the Byron Heights Badgers and I&#39;m invited. Sounds like a good excuse to talk to her and the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so that&#39;s another option,&quot; Luna shrugged. &quot;And my sorority&#39;s still on the table. And I guess we could always go back to the Vodka Voodoo Bar & Grill and try to find some bisexual girls hanging around there. What do <i>you</i> think?&quot;</p>
