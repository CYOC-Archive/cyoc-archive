<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everybody knows that galaxies are basically series of interconnected balls.<br />
<br />
The space ball knew this oh so very well. They may not be omnipotent or all-knowing, but their holiness was absolute. Round. Squishy. Fleshy. Just balls. It was a bliss being a ball. Standing around. Rolling. Being squished. Expanding. Contracting....<br />
<br />
The ball didn’t have any meaningful memories of its own life. Had it always been a sentient ball of flesh? Was it the first ball of its kind to appear in the universe? Was it an alien or just an unfortunate soul that had been deprived of its original physical form and sanity? It had no idea. It just ‘knew’ that converting every single living being into balls was its holy duty as an avatar of balls themselves.<br />
<br />
The landing on the planet had been a success. Most of its gas had been expelled from its body in order to traverse the black void of space causing the space ball to shrink in size until it was the size of a toy marble.<br />
<br />
Thankfully this planet’s atmosphere had plenty of gas. The ball gasped through his breathing hole (had it always been a breathing hole? Wasn’t it something else before...?) slowly reinflating itself with air. But before it could finish, it felt itself being grabbed and squished by some of the local fauna.<br />
<br />
Being forcefully grabbed and squeezed until your whole self turned flat felt amazing when you were a ball (and a very masochistic one at that, because to be frank it actually hurt like hell) which is why everybody in the whole galaxy must experience it.<br />
<br />
The two specimens of the local fauna produced laughing sounds from their throats as they used appendages (icky) to punch each other on the shoulders.<br />
<br />
At first the ball thought that the specimens were being violent towards each other, but upon closer observation it became apparent that these primitive lifeforms were performing some sort of mating ritual.<br />
<br />
It looked like the ball’s job was going to be easy this time. It inhaled air extremely quickly in order to grow in an instant (it took the ball decades to fully master this technique, usually newly converted balls take hours to inflate like this) until it was bigger than both of the earthlings. And then, when the two youngster approached it with curiosity, it excreted its reproductive spores.<br />
<br />
The two humans recoiled in disgust, complaining that it was the nastiest fart they ever presentiated. But soon enough they noticed it was no ordinary gas, and they looked at their arms in complete horror to find that their limbs were receding into their own bodies.<br />
<br />
Both of them were screaming until their faces lost all of their facial features including their loud vocal orifices, and then they began to shrink. The female one did her best to conceal herself as her clothes fell off, her hairless skin and her breasts exposed as they lost their perky shape and her whole body turned into an amorphous fleshy mass. She shivered and coiled up into a ball, very embarrassed to be seen like such a monstrosity, specially in front of someone important to her.<br />
<br />
As for the male one, he looked at her female companion in shock until his own eyes receded away. He felt his clothes fall into the floor, exposing his body hair which was unusually abundant for his young age. Unlike the female, he didn’t seem too ashamed about his exposing his flat breasts, but his rapidly thinning arms seemed to be reaching for his groin, both in shame and in utter horror of his cock and balls receding into themselves as well.<br />
<br />
Both former humans beings looked like quickly shrinking balls of flesh without limbs right now... except for one part each.<br />
The female felt a terrible shock when she noticed a cold air caressing her vagina. “Why?!”, the ball of flesh with her exposed hole thought. “Why is this the only part of me that’s completely intact?! Someone help me! Jack, where are you?!”<br />
<br />
Of course, her companion could not hear her nor have any way to reply back his response. The male human was now a small ball of flesh. Pink human skin with no body features except for the body hair that used to surround them, which was a stark contrast to the female ball who was completely shaved all over, even her privates.<br />
<br />
However, just like the female ball had been allowed to retain her privates, the male one had the terrible fortune of conserving one essential body part: his hairy anus.<br />
<br />
The ball looked at its handiwork and felt proud. Now that there’s a couple of female and male balls, both of them young and fertile, they should be able to spread their seed all over the planet. This silly planet would become infested with balls everywhere in no time. But there was no time to waste, there were lots of more planets to colonize. Once again filling itself with air, the venerable ball inflated until it began to lift off the ground like an air balloon, expelling some ball now and then to control the direction.<br />
<br />
As the alien ball left to spread its ‘love’ into other planets two balls of flesh each not bigger than a small dog were panicking with no way to communicate with anyone, not even each other. They didn’t even know what their new bodies were supposed to be capable of.<br />
<br />
Melody’s soft skin was sweating bullets. She was terrified of anyone finding her in this state and thinking she was some sort of sex toy. Her vision was pitch dark, although she wasn’t sure if she was blind or it was just too dark in this time of night.<br />
She then heard small, pitiful sounds.<br />
*Poot, poot, poot...*<br />
She didn’t know where it was coming from. But the short bursts of sound sounded disgusting. She hoped nobody was taking a dump nearby.<br />
<br />
However, the source of those sounds was no other than Jack.<br />
<i>“(Melody?! Melody?! Where are you?!)”</i><br />
He tried over and over to yell Melody’s name, but his voice came out all distorted, as if he were literally talking out from his ass. Jack tried to move, but the only thing the thing managed to do was to shift its weight around until the hairy ball stomped into a tree between some bushes.<br />
<br />
Above the skies, the ball stared down into Earth and blessed the newly converted balls: <i>“(Prosper! Reproduce! Fill Earth! Take charge! Be responsible for fish in the sea and birds in the air, for every living thing that moves on the face of Earth... shall become as balls!)”</i></p>
