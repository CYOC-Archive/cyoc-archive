<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Dean was out of it, not really noticing anything around him anymore, the caretaker took more notes on Sams and Adams ideas, until they both fell asleep due the sleeping drug in their beer. The caretaker went to collect them, and half an hour later he had all three on his working tables. He quickly mixed his wax before covering them, so when Sam and Adam woke up again they were ready to be molded. And the caretaker had already made plans for them.<br />
Groggily Sam opened his eyes and tried to sit up, only to realize he couldn´t. “What? Where am I? Dean? Adam?”<br />
Adam was in a similar situation, but answered him with: “Sam, what happened? Why can´t I move?”<br />
The caretaker had used this time to remove Deans cock from his mouth, and he mumbled a “Hmmm Sam? Adam?” It was weakly spoken, but both had heard him.<br />
But before they could ask Dean why he sounded so weak the caretaker spoke up: “You are in my workshop, and your brother has been here for some time already. And I must thank you for your ideas, Dean had fun sucking his own cock for nearly four hours.” He laughed at their faces as he showed them Deans cock in his hands. Then he explained the abilities of his wax and they realized that they had played with people still alive out there, making them sick in the stomach.<br />
“Don´t worry, I´m sure they liked the attention you gave them. But now I will start working with you, I already have something in mind for you three to be real close.”<br />
As all three started to protest, even when Dean sounded tired now, the caretaker took both Sams and Adams cock and balls away, just like he had with Deans before, and placed them on the cold table next to them. He then separated the balls before cutting a third from each of their cocks out. All three whimpered at that, but it wasn´t painful to any of them, just feeling real odd.<br />
Next he molded the cut down cocks to look normal again, just smaller, closing the gap he had cut in by pressing it together. Before Dean could react he had Sams cock in his throat, and after it was all in had his lips sealed again, the cock felt as if it was glued to his teeth. The same was done to Sam with Adams cock, he just struggled more then Dean had before his mouth was sealed shut. Finally Adam had Deans cock down his throat and the caretaker had could now work in silence.<br />
Now he took the cut-out pieces of their cokcs, with had already made a mess on his table. “I see you like your treatment already.” he laughed. He then put the parts together, molding one big, reshaped cock out of the pieces before closing the tip, so their cum would only spill into each others throats. Next he took on ball of each boy and molded them together into one bigger testicle, doing the same with the conterparts before merging them to the new cock and in an even bigger ballsack. And all through that process the three brothers moaned, sucking on each others cocks and drinking each others cum.<br />
The caretaker smiled at their peaceful faces. The next part of work would have them panicking if they were completely aware, because he took out a special saw and soon beheaded all three of them, placing their heads next to each other on another table overlooking their bodies. Even with their clouded minds they started to panic, but couldn´t do anything more then suck their brothers cocks and watch.<br />
Grinning the caretaker placed Sams body on top of Deans back to back and started to merge them together, thickening their torso with even more wax. He merged Sams legs into one long limb abobe Deans ass, his feet forming a pointy tip on its end. Sams legs and feet were now a long tail. Sams arms were pulled up and his fingers were spread wide and made longer with wax. Then a thin layer of wax was used to form membrans between them, finishing a set of wings.<br />
Satisfied with Sams reformed body the caretaker took out his saw again, cutting off the limbs from Adams body. Then he placed the cut-off limbs next to Deans. He merged Adams right leg to Deans left arm and the other limbs acordingly switched, each time a leg with an arm. The now meatier limbs then were reshaped into four big and strong legs, their merged hands and feet turned out as big, three-clawed paws.<br />
Afterwards the caretaker cut Adams remaining body into three equal sized parts. This parts then were remolded into a round shape, which soon were placed on Deans cut off neck and on each shoulder. All three brothers had by now an idea of what their merged body resembled, and were confirmed in their idea when the caretaker started to carve their skin to look like scales, adding wax for spikes on the back and finally adding the big cock and balls to the body. It resembled a big, three headed dragon, only the heads missing now.<br />
“What a beatiful creature, don´t you think boys? But we need to add the last pieces so don´t run away now.”  He than laughed at his own joke, moving over to their heads on the table. He took Adams first and reformed his head. He added wax to form a snout and horns, carved in scales and merged his hair and ears under the skin. Soon only Adams eyes were remaining, but the caretaker was satisfied, so he placed Adams head on the middle new neck of the dragon body. Soon Sams head looked nearly identical to Adams and was placed on the left neck, while Deans head was placed on the right one, also looking like the other two. You could only differ the three brothers by their eyes now.<br />
The satisfied caretaker added another special potion to their body, slowly covering each part of their outside. It turned their insides to fit their new anatomy, without changing their feelings of different parts. Sam could still feel the now operational wings as his arms and hands, and Adam would still feel his right arm and hand in the left hindleg.<br />
After said potion was fully absorbed he used the latex paint to slowly turn the still flesh-colored and white wax-dragon into one with dark green scales, mint-green membrans and belly scales and bright white teeth, claws and spikes.<br />
Finally he used one maschine to even increase their size more, at least doubling it. When he added the last potion their body became animated again, but not with them in control.<br />
To Dean it was all surreal. While he sucked on Sams cock he watched as his body was used as base for the dragon. He felt heavier overall, as both Sams and Adams body were on top of him. He also felt as if Adam stood on his hands, and as Adam was part of the legs they were kinda heavy too. The paint tickled on his skin, and the growing increased all that even more.<br />
Sam wasn´t better, to him it was surreal too. He sucked on Adams cock while feeling his own being sucked in Deans mouth. He was forced to watch his body being merged to Deans back, he felt his now useless legs as an heavy tail and his raised arms got heavy to hold up, not that he could change that. To him the paint itched more and he felt the wings-membrans connect to the nerves  of his fingers. When their body became animated he wanted to scream in pain as the body beat his former arms around wildly, even more so when all their combined weight was lifted up by his arms alone by flying low.<br />
Adam couldn´t place this whole experience. As he sucked off on Deans cock like he had made that caveman do on his own he was even more sorry for the poor man. It felt uncomfortable to be cut into pieces, and now he had all that weight on his smaller limbs, as he felt them inside of the meaty dragon ones. Then Dean stood on his hands rather heavy, just as he unknowingly stood on Deans, not to forget he felt all wrong in sense of direction. His body tickled when it reformed into the necks of the dragon body, but the paint felt asif it burned him, as the necks were former open parts of his body.<br />
The caretaker led the three-headed dragon over to his new position. He would stand as a guard in the entrance hall of his home. The dragon would be able to spit out small balls of wax from each head, and that wax would expand over living flesh in under a minute, so mutiple intruders could be catched. The intruders would be covered with the wax to stop them from fleeing. Said wax was the cum from their stomach, which was turned into wax inside.<br />
While the outside, merged cock of his three bodies was normally unable to leak any cum as it was sealed, so they got all their cum down their throats, he could use it to get the wax out of it´s stomach with a codeword. That way he would never have problems to get his wax again.<br />
“You will guard this entrance, my mighty dragon.” After flying up to the pedastal it took a pose before stopping to move again. It´s tail wrapped around the pedastal, front-paws at the rim of it while he sat down, hind-paws in between it´s front ones. It´s mighty wings spread outwards to cast a light-green light, as it was reflected from it´s wings membrans. Adams head looked straight at the entrance door, Sam looked at the left corridors, fourty-five degree angle to Adam, while Dean did the same to the right side.<br />
And as it stood there frozen like a statue, all three brothers tried to move it, but it was in vain. Over time the pain from their weight didn´t bother any of them anymore, as they were by then in constant bliss for being sucked off, cumming at least once in half an hour into the troat of their broters. But they never drifted off to sleep, as an ever watching guardian for their master, not that any of them thought of him as such, still trying to regain control.</p>
