<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom left the bathroom not really knowing why he&#39;d been so turned on by Davis. He had a girlfriend and was a faithful guy except for his times with Davis and the team. He thought that if he ever told her, his explanation would be team bonding and unity. This sounded weak even to himself but he didn&#39;t really try an justify it more to himself. As he walked to class, he began to feel slightly itchy. He sat down in a seat next to Jake and noticed that Jake was glaring at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bro, what&#39;s up!&quot; Tom said trying to lighten the mood or at least change Jakes lazerlije focus from himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, how are you feeling?&quot; Jake asked with a menacing tilt of his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine I guess.&quot; Tom replied but then, he realized that he didn&#39;t feel exactly fine. He was itching like crazy. <br />
<br />
As the class went on, Tom realized that the itching had continued. Then, to his shock, he realized that the hair on his arms was growing and thickening at a visible rate. <br />
<br />
Tom got up and tried to ease his way out of the classroom but when he did, he tripped over his large feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Hodge do you have a problem?&quot; The professor said as he was distracted by Tom&#39;s tumble. <br />
&quot;No professor, I&#39;m just going to the bathroom.&quot; Tom muttered as he stumbled out the door. <br />
<br />
Down the hall and in the bathroom, Tom took off his shirt to reveal a pelt of fur. He&#39;d always been a hairy guy. Ever since middle school he had been covered in hair but this was almost beastial. Tom went to lock the door so he could get a more extensive look at whatever was happening. <br />
<br />
As he moved towards the door, he tripped again. This time, he broke his right flipflop. While examining the broken shoe, Tom noticed that his big feet had become even bigger. He had been teased in high school about his size twelve feet. Specifically by a girlfriend who had been disappointed when the old wive&#39;s take about the feet to meat ratio wasn&#39;t shown by his average endowment. He was now certain that his feet were pushing past size 14 now. <br />
<br />
He gingerly stood up and went to lock the door. When he had done so and check to see if the three stalls were empty, he went back in front of the mirror. His chest his stomach was a complete pelt an his arms were also densely covered in hair. Removing his cargo shorts revealed that his legs were more hairy than ever. <br />
<br />
 Standing there in his briefs, he realized that his bulge seemed a little fuller. &quot;Is this just a second puberty?&quot; He thought. With a kind of hopeful shudder but when he removed his briefs, he recoiled from what he saw in the mirror. His pubes were thicker than ever but still trimmed as he had done this morning. The shocking thing was his five and a half inch cock. It hung there just as it always had but what has changed was the foreskin that had covered it all his life. <br />
<br />
Until recently, his time in the locker room had been made miserable because he had been the only uncut guy in his high school. His friends had called him names and made fun of his more natural looking genitalia. He had always hated that his parents had been so careless in deciding to keep him uncircumcised. Some girls he had dated had laughed and refused to touch his &quot;more European&quot; looking dick. <br />
<br />
Now, the part of his body that had given him more stress that anything was hanging a clean four inches over the head of his dick. He tried to pull it back to see the head but there was just too much skin. Sticking his finger inside it to try and peel it back sent an electric surge through him. Instantly, his flaccid dick was rock hard with anticipation. Tom was able to see an outline of the hard head in the fleshy foreskin but there was still about three inches of skin that gave the image of a long flesh spout at the end of his erection. Josh grabbed this fleshy appendage an rolled it back and forth as he jerked his dick. He came quicker than he could remember panting from the heightened sensitivity. Then, there was a knock on the door...</p>
