<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rufus was gnawing fairly hard on the camera. Emily practically froze in fear. All the good feelings that came with changing reality suddenly vanished as the possibility rose that she could be changed. Just then, Jacki finally noticed that Rufus was biting down on something he shouldn&#39;t have been biting.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Bad dog!&quot; She yelled in her commanding southern drawl.<br />
<br />
Rufus, becoming panicked at the sudden yelling, clamped harder on the camera. Emily just watched in horror as the flash emitted upward, hitting Rufus and barely capturing her in the photo as well. Her eyes were temporarily blinded as she felt a massive wave of nausea befall her. She internally cursed herself for not being carful, but the damage was done.<br />
<br />
Emily regained her vision and immediately knew something was horribly wrong. She was no longer sitting on the stool she was sitting on in the kitchen, but was now looking up at the ceiling. She prayed to God hoping she wasn&#39;t a dog or a hamster. She tried to move her body to get a better look, but found she could no longer move. Try as she might, she couldn&#39;t move a muscle.<br />
<br />
She tried to yell out for help but not even her lips could move. After she stopped internally cursing herself out, she managed to hear some distant sounding voices. &quot;Wait, that&#39;s gotta be Jacqueline and Laura!&quot; She thought as she tried to listen in to their conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;...re you sure you don&#39;t need my help tonight Laura?&quot; Emily heard Jacki asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Jacki.... I&#39;m fine.&quot; Laura responded unconvincingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just... you&#39;ve already got one kid with another in the way. And, with Mike gone...&quot; Jacki began to reason before Laura presumably gave her a look as the two both stopped talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I at least drive Rebecca to ballet?&quot; Jacki asked with a softer voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay fine.&quot; Laura huffed.<br />
<br />
Emily figured out what must have happened pretty quickly. Apparently, Rufus the dog was now Rebecca, a human child. Laura was &quot;her&quot; mother and had another child on the way. &quot;But who the hell am I and why can&#39;t I move!&quot; She thought as she continued to try and move even an inch.<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s train of thought was interrupted by a sudden loud stomping sound. It got louder and louder as it approached wherever Emily was laying. She tried to move in a panic but it was no use. Suddenly, she felt something large and pointy hit her from the side. She found herself quickly spinning around in a circle as she moved from where ever she was laying. She tried not to get sick just as she slammed into a wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Jacki whined. &quot;Laura, please tell Rebecca not to leave her toys lying around. I almost tripped on this thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toy?!&quot; Emily internally screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Could you pick that one up please and bring it to her room?&quot; Laura asked politely. &quot;That&#39;s Rebecca&#39;s favorite toy. Her playtime Emily doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s mind was racing. She was a doll. She was nothing more than a piece of plastic to be played with by a little girl who was once a dog. She wanted to cry but no tears came out. She wanted to close her eyes but nothing happened. A giant hand came into vision as it scooped Emily up in its manicured mitts. <br />
<br />
&quot;WELL TELL HER SHE SHOULDN&#39;T LEAVE HER FAVORITE TOYS AROUND IF  SHE DOESN&#39;T WANT THEM TO BREAK OR GET LOST!&quot; Jacki said in a voice that sounded booming to Emily.<br />
<br />
Emily began to calm down from her initial shock as she started looking for the camera. Although it was hard to see with her body being swung around from Jacki&#39;s walk, she could tell that the camera was no where in sight. &quot;Okay, so if isn&#39;t in the kitchen, then its gotta be somewhere else in the house.&quot; She thought.<br />
<br />
Jacki opened the door to some room in the house and her booming voice came back. &quot;HEY KIDDO. LOSE SOMETHING?&quot; She asked teasingly. Emily found herself being thrown through the air. She tried to put her hands out to catch herself before remembering she couldn&#39;t. Thankfully though, a smaller (Though still huge to Emily) pair of hands caught her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily!&quot; The voice yelled happily. &quot;That&#39;s where you were! With Aunti Jacki.&quot; She adorably scolded Emily.<br />
<br />
The kid turned Emily towards herself and Emily got a good look at her. She was a cute little girl with curly blond hair tied up in ponytails and freckles that lined her pudgy face. Emily thought she was the cutest little kid, but she had to remind herself that this girl used to be Rufus the dog. Although, it appeared that &quot;Rebecca&quot; was now Laura&#39;s biological daughter, as she looked a lot like her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can play for a bit, but then we have to get you to ballet alright?&quot; Jacki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay.&quot; She adorably lisped as she placed Emily down.<br />
<br />
Emily found herself feeling a little bigger as Rebecca placed her inside a dollhouse. It was an older kind of dollhouse so a lit of the walls and furniture looked real enough. &quot;If only I could move,&quot; She thought &quot;this place doesn&#39;t look half bad.&quot; She laughed to herself. Rebecca turned Emily and moved her body so that she was sitting on the bed, then she ran to her closet to get something.<br />
<br />
Luckily, there was a little mirror inside the house that Emily was now facing, and she couldn&#39;t believe what she saw. It was a doll. Not just any doll though, this doll looked exactly like her. Her brown hair was perfectly the same, except it was likely made out of fibers and looked a little goofier than normal. Her face was painted on and was stuck in a permanent smile. Her joints were now all moveable screws, and most embarrassingly of all, she was naked. Though weirdly enough, she had nothing really inappropriate. Where her nipples and privates should have been were completely smoothed over plastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, just freaking perfect.&quot; Emily sadly thought as she waited for her only helping hand to come back. <br />
<br />
Rebecca arrived soon enough and suddenly Emily found her field of view blocked for a second. When she could see again, she found she was now wearing a red dress, though her fake hair was now a mess. <br />
&quot;Oops, sorry Emily, let me fix your hair!&quot; Rebecca giggled.<br />
<br />
Emily was once again lifted into the air. Rebecca took out a little brush and started to fix her hair. Emily decided to take this opportunity to survey the room. It was a stereotypical little girl&#39;s room with pink as far as the eye could see. There were various other dolls as well as stuffed animals, a few blankets, and girly costumes. Emily was about to stop looking out of boredom but then she saw it, the camera of change!<br />
<br />
It was just sitting there, only half visible under one of Rebecca&#39;s blankets. Emily would&#39;ve jumped for joy if she wasn&#39;t plastic and started laughing to herself. She quickly realized, however, that she wasn&#39;t out of the ballpark yet. She actually needed someone to take her picture. <br />
&quot;Well that shouldn&#39;t be that much of a problem.&quot; She hoped. &quot;After all, it&#39;s only a matter of time before someone notices the damned thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
As if on cue, Rebecca suddenly stopped brushing Emily&#39;s hair, and placed her on the floor.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; She wondered aloud as she walked towards the camera. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Emily couldn&#39;t see what was going on, but she prayed Rebecca was doing what she hoped she was doing.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when...</p>
