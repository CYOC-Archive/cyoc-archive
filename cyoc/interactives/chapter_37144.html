<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I slowly woke up. The first thing that I noticed was that my pussy was sore and I knew that I had been raped. Whoever it was wasn't gentle even though I was out. The next thing that I noticed was that I was naked and laying down on a bed. The final thing that I noticed was that I was bound and gagged.<br />
<br />
I slowly opened my eyes and saw that it was still night. I looked over to my left and saw that Sam was bound, gagged, and naked as well. She was looking at me with fear in her eyes. I knew how she felt. With the gag in my mouth I couldn't say anything.<br />
<br />
I looked around to see where we were. We were obviously in a bedroom. The walls were a dingy green color. The ceiling was a yellowed white color. The bed we were on was an old iron bed. We were tied to the bars at the top and bottom, our legs spread to allow whoever it was that raped us to rape us at their leisure. I could see a window but all I could see out of it was the night sky.<br />
<br />
I became uncomfortable as I really needed to pee. I couldn't hold it any longer and my bladder let go. It was a relief but I knew that I would soon be smelling it. I heard Sam relieve herself also.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes the door to the bedroom opened and two men came in. I would say that they were in their thirties.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're awake&quot; one of them said. He was about five foot eight and had a bald head. There were scars on his face and chest. When he smiled you could see that his teeth were yellow and crooked. His hair was a tangled, greasy mess. All in all he would be lucky to get a willing woman to go out with him.<br />
<br />
The other guy wasn't any better. He was so hairy that he looked like Bigfoot. What skin I could see was riddled with acne. His teeth were yellow and crooked. His eyes were bloodshot.<br />
<br />
I heard a muffled grunt come from Sam. I knew what she was thinking and feeling. I felt sick when I thought about these two raping us.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think they like us Larry&quot; the one that looked like Bigfoot said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you not to call me by my name!&quot; Larry said. &quot;Now we definitely can't let them live Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you were going to let them live anyway&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got me there&quot; Larry said.<br />
<br />
Larry came up to me and squeezed my dick hard. It was so hard that I let out a muffled cry of pain. Harry did the same thing to Sam and she too let out a muffled cry of pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freaks like you don't deserve to live&quot; Larry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least they do have pussies&quot; Harry said. &quot;We can have our fun while they slowly die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry must have seen the fear in my eyes since he laughed and said &quot;Oh yes. You are going to die a slow, painful death. You see we won't give you any food or water.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was horrified. We could survive only a few days without water.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Larry and Harry dropped their pants and underwear. Their cocks were already hard. Larry positioned himself over me and Harry positioned himself over Sam.<br />
<br />
Larry smiled and thrust into me. When he did it was painful. I wasn't stimulated so my pussy was relatively dry. Also by thrusting into me like that he didn't allow my vagina and womb time to expand. He kept thrusting in and out until he orgasmed. I could hardly feel his cum hitting my womb. When he pulled out I saw that there was blood on his dick. I was bleeding but my period wasn't due for another two weeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well&quot; Larry said. &quot;This one is bleeding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So is this one&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
I looked at both Larry and Harry and thought 'You two have always been pieces of shit.' I waited for something to happen but nothing did. I guess that the ring would only alter reality using my thoughts if I was an animal that couldn't speak, an inanimate object, or possibly dead. That last one didn't make sense but I thought it anyway. I could only hope that they would remove my gag so I could transform them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I want that ring you have on your finger&quot; Larry said. &quot;It looks really old and that makes it really valuable. The problem is that it's stuck on your finger. So in order to get it off I have to cut your finger off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry went into another room and when he came back he was carrying a blowtorch and some heavy duty pruning sheers. I thrashed around hoping that he wouldn't be able to cut my finger off.<br />
<br />
Larry just said &quot;Hold her so I can cut off her finger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry laid on top of me to keep me from squirming and grabbed my hand. He held my fingers down except for my middle finger which he held straight out. Larry moved in with those sheers and I started screaming though the gag in my mouth muffled it. Sam started to scream too. Hopefully someone will hear us and call the cops. Though by the time they got here my finger would already have been cut off.<br />
<br />
Larry slipped the sheers over my finger just below my ring. Smiling he slowly started to squeeze. The pain was excruciating as my finger was slowly cut off. Finally with a snap the sheers cut through the bone and finished cutting off my finger.<br />
<br />
Harry held my severed finger so I could see it while Larry grabbed the blowtorch and lit it. I knew what he was going to do. He was going to cauterize the stump that was left.<br />
<br />
Larry lowered the flame of the blowtorch slowly to my bleeding finger stump. Suddenly I could smell burning flesh as I felt extreme pain. It was a wonder that I didn't pass out from the pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that takes care of the bleeding&quot; Larry said as he stood up. He took my finger and left followed by Harry.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It has been a few days since we were kidnapped and true to their word Larry and Harry haven't given us anything to eat or drink. A few hours after Larry had cut off my finger they had come in and cut off our eyelids. They did Sam first then me. A couple hours after that they gouged out our eyes. Again they did Sam first then me. Of course they stuffed cotton into our eye sockets.<br />
<br />
They continued to rape us. Each time they did they would painfully squeeze our dicks. They would take what I think were razor blades and cut us at odd intervals. They even cut off a couple more of my fingers and three toes. I think they did the same to Sam as I could hear her muffled screams.<br />
<br />
I slowly became weaker and weaker over the days from lack of food and water. Also we couldn't move much so our muscles atrophied. We were also sitting in our shit and piss.<br />
<br />
Larry had told me that he had been able to get the ring off my finger and that he had sold it for a quarter million dollars.<br />
<br />
On this day I heard them approach us but instead of cutting us or raping us they took out the gags.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may be wondering why we took the gags out&quot; Larry said. &quot;Well it won't be long until you're dead and we want to hear your voices.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam said in a weak voice &quot;You're... in... trouble... now.&quot;<br />
<br />
They laughed and Harry said &quot;Yeah right.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had been waiting for this day. I would be seeing if the ring would indeed alter reality if I wasn't wearing it like the fortune teller said. I wasn't happy just turning them into inanimate objects. I had a better plan in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to say anything?&quot; Larry asked.<br />
<br />
It was time so I said &quot;Larry... you and Harry... will retain... your memories... of who you are... when reality... is altered. You Larry... are my... little sister. Harry... is... Sam's... little sister. You are both... completely female.&quot;<br />
<br />
They laughed at what I said then suddenly they were silent. I could only guess that they saw that they were transforming.<br />
<br />
I couldn't see their transformation but shortly new memories came flooding in.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I heard someone knocking on a door and my mom call &quot;Allison! I need you to get up and watch your sister! I was called in to work! You can still have your friends over today! Just be good and don't destroy the house!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom!&quot; I called back as I opened my eyes. It was good to be able to see again. I looked at my hands and saw all of my fingers and my ring. It had worked when I wasn't wearing it. I wondered how Larry was going to react to his new life. I guess I shouldn't call him Larry anymore. He was now Laura, my six year old sister. Harry was now Harrietta, Sam's five year old sister.<br />
<br />
I knew that we'd have to tell our friends what happened since they would remember the past few days where we were missing. I'm sure that they were worried sick. Other than that this could be an interesting day.</p>
