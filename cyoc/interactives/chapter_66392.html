<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel debated just dropping the egg and furiously wiping her hand on her dress, but she didn't want to ruin <br />
her  costume if she could help it. She decided to just put it down and then get as much distance between <br />
herself and the squad as possible, since it seemed like something was happening to them. Before she could, <br />
however, the egg cracked in her hand and the top fell off. A small puff of... something blew out and Rachel <br />
couldn't help but breathe it in. It smelled sour. Rachel coughed, dropping the empty eggshell. She felt <br />
something bubbling up her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cock!&quot; she shouted, the word bursting from her lips. Rachel's hands flew to her lips as her eyes widened. <br />
Where did that come from?<br />
<br />
The other three girls looked surprised as well, then their expressions changed to confusion. One by one, each <br />
one echoed their leader. &quot;Cock!&quot; yelled Tanya. &quot;Cock!&quot; shouted Hailey. &quot;Cock!&quot; said Sarah. &quot;Cock! Cock! Cock!&quot; <br />
the three clucked together, unable to help themselves.<br />
<br />
Each time the word was said, Rachel felt pins and needles across her body. She felt the urge to shout again <br />
but managed to hold it down. She tried to ignore the shouting as she looked down at the cracked egg. What was <br />
going on? she wondered. Sarah, Tanya, and Hailey finally quieted down, but the silence didn't last long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, noooo!&quot; moaned the small blond as she felt pressure in her pelvis. Her ass thrust out behind her, she <br />
arched her back to jut her small, perky breasts outward. She managed to get a hand under her princess dress to <br />
pull down her panties before she felt the urge to hold her hips. Squatting and moaning, she pushed the large <br />
white egg from her vagina, her eyes rolled up in her head as it rubbed slowly against her clit. With a small <br />
smack, the egg dropped to the ground and rolled out from between her spread feet.<br />
<br />
Rachel watched it. She was suddenly feeling warm, pleasantly so, from watching Tanya lay it. Distantly she <br />
heard a crack as Hailey's egg splintered and the top fell off. A second crack and Tanya's egg also opened. <br />
Both were empty aside from the sour smell. Rachel inhaled it, finding it actually sort of comforting instead <br />
of gross. She felt her lips tremble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cock!&quot; she screeched loudly.<br />
<br />
The other girls helplessly echoed her. &quot;Cock, cock, cock!&quot; they shouted, their hands on their hips. Their <br />
pointed arms wobbled at their sides, almost like flapping wings. Rachel watched them, the warmth in her body <br />
growing. &quot;Cock!&quot; she shouted again, and the others echoed as they thrust their asses out behind them and their <br />
breasts out before them.<br />
<br />
On the stage, Kylie was smiling. She snapped her fingers a second time. Time to finish things up.<br />
<br />
Rachel knew she should be worried and somewhere in the back of her mind she was, terrified even, but it was <br />
buried under an increasing wave of arousal as her body flushed. Her fellow cheerleaders looked so sexy with <br />
their arms flapping and their asses thrust out. Their clucking of 'cock!' was starting to arouse her too and <br />
she found herself squawking more and more to keep them going. Her own hands rested on her hips and flapped <br />
awkwardly but this was normal, wasn't it?<br />
<br />
Sarah moaned, &quot;Coooock!&quot; Her bared pussy glistened with moisture as she squatted down. The white curve of <br />
another egg poked from her folds and Rachel shuddered. She was so sexy when she was laying. The angelic squad <br />
leader felt pressure building in her own crotch. She wondered if she was going to lay an egg too, but that <br />
thought seemed wrong somehow.<br />
<br />
Sarah's egg fell from her and cracked upon contact with the ground. This set off another round of clucking as <br />
Rachel spread her legs and bent her knees. The others followed her actions, each one suddenly finding their <br />
leader so much more important and even... sexy?<br />
<br />
Tanya felt jealous of the way Rachel watched Sarah lay an egg. She wanted to be looked at like that. With a <br />
grunt, she concentrated and sure enough felt the pressure of an egg forming and moving down her vagina. When <br />
Rachel turned to look at her, arms flapping where they were anchored to her hips, Tanya squawked in pleasure. <br />
An orgasm rippled through her as the egg popped free.<br />
<br />
Rachel felt her panties strain beneath her angel dress. Something was bulging from her groin but getting <br />
caught. &quot;Cock!&quot; she cried and the other three answered. Then something changed.<br />
<br />
In a sudden surge, Rachel's feet burst from her white heels as they expanded. Her toes fused together leaving <br />
three long digits. A curved claw grew at the end of each, and a sharp spur burst from her heel. The skin of <br />
toes and legs darkened, turning a scaly yellow. Her clawed chicken feet scratched at the wooden floor, leaving <br />
small marks.<br />
<br />
The other three girls saw this and clucked in interest. Each one felt her own shoes rip as their feet changed <br />
to match their leader. Rachel was horny as she watched these changes, watched her squad become her hens from <br />
the waist down. She crowed again as her lips hardened and split as a beak pushed from her mouth. The other <br />
girls answered as their own beaks pushed from their lips.<br />
<br />
Rachel thrust her crotch out toward the nearest hen. As she arched her back backward, her costume wings <br />
brushed against her arms. The feathers from it stuck to her skin, taking root as they began to grow, filling <br />
in the gaps and transforming her arms into bright white wings. Her red hair fused together and shrank into a <br />
red cock's comb upon her head as she continued to crow.<br />
<br />
Hailey strutted forward on her new chicken legs, darting her head forward as she moved. There was something <br />
under all that fabric that she wanted. With a squawk she tore into it with her new beak, ripping aside white <br />
cloth and snapping the waistband of Rachel's underwear. Freed from its confines, a bright red cock sprang <br />
forth from Rachel's groin as two red, scaly balls dangled freely. Hailey stared at it as her eyes shrank, <br />
becoming dark and beady. A worm! She darted her head forward and sucked it down her throat, licking it with <br />
her small, pointed tongue.<br />
<br />
Rachel cawed in pleasure. The other hens took up their clucking chorus as they followed their rooster's lead <br />
and sprouted feathers, their arms becoming wings. They scratched the ground impatiently, waiting for their <br />
turn at the red worm between Rache's legs.<br />
<br />
The rooster finally threw his head back. &quot;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&quot; he cried out as he filled Hailey-hen's mouth <br />
with hot cock seed. The sound of his voice caused all three hens to simultaneously lay large, white eggs and <br />
cluck in their own fowl orgasms. Sarah-hen took Hailey-hen's place, slurping down Rachel-cock's worm in <br />
delight.<br />
<br />
Kylie laughed at the sight of the four cheerleaders reduced to clucking, squawking chickens. It had been <br />
obvious how the three fawned around Rachel, treating her like a cock in the hen house. Kylie had only made <br />
things more literal. She considered turning them all into full chickens, or even more chicken-like anthros, <br />
but decided against it. They were freaky chicken girls and a freaky chicken rooster-thing. That was much more <br />
interesting.<br />
<br />
Not saying a word, the witch looked around the room once more. She enjoyed playing with social groups. Perhaps <br />
there were others that she could give a new attitude to?</p>
