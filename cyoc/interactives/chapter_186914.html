<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Ethan worked his way toward an understanding of what happened to them, including why their mentalities and understandings were shifting in such a way, Carl found himself considering what happened up there. Just...thinking...of the sex they had together was enough to get him rosy cheeked, let alone how good it felt to have that most intimate part of him buried in Ethan&#39;s tightly muscled ass. Carl...Carl wasn&#39;t exactly GAY, but he wasn&#39;t...he definitely wasn&#39;t straight, now that he thought about himself and what he liked.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never really considered it when he was younger. But then, when he was younger, these things were considered inappropriate. To be swept aside and never mentioned or thought of. But nowadays, with acceptance on the rise, Carl found himself - now at 16 physical years of age - thinking about things in ways he never dared to before.<br />
<br />
Down in the lab, though, Ethan himself was likewise having an awkward few moments as he considered what happened. His whole life, he considered himself a straight man. A bro, even, when he was younger. He slept with all the women he could manage to when he was 45, and there was no doubt in his mind that, now he was 18 again, he would continue with that trend. He was after all a dashingly handsome, heavily muscled jock again. He&#39;d wanted his promising, glorious youth back, and he got it.<br />
<br />
He also got himself thinking about how good it felt having Carl do that to him. He remembered thrusting away into Melissa, and all the while, Carl pumped his hips, desperately  - eagerly - into Ethan&#39;s own ass. It was a sensation unlike anything he&#39;d ever felt before. Not unpleasant whatsoever - more, he was worried for just how pleasant it was to be fucking and fucked at the same time.<br />
<br />
Ethan hadn&#39;t even bothered to put on his labcoat again, and was at work just looking at the data he collected. He&#39;d need to check to see if there were any effects on people&#39;s libidos from this change. It definitely seemed that way to him - they succumbed very easily to the thrills of their hormones. Maybe it WAS just them being young, restless and eager again. But maybe there was something more there. A relinquishment of control over oneself.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked in the nearby glass window, finding himself grinning at his reflection. One bicep flex... there, now back to work, Ethan chuckled at himself.<br />
<br />
Yes, it looked like, when he drew a bit of his own blood and tested it, there was a difference in the chemistry therein. It seemed authentically like he was indeed in the latter stages of puberty. Every single chemical indicator had him pegged for 18, even though just at the start of the day he&#39;d been 45. And that meant that all the chemicals that regulated mood and emotional continuancy were likely in the same state. Meaning...well, the hypothesis was looking more and more like an established theory;<br />
<br />
Regressing in this way also included in the package regressing physiologically to the finest detail. With all THAT entailed.<br />
<br />
Ethan crossed his arms as he started sending it in to be examined a bit further - he&#39;d have the whole picture on the biochemical level by the next day. Heh, here he was a young, studly jock with the brilliant mind of a scientist. Just another reminder that he had it all... And then his reverie was broken a little bit by the sound of the elevator coming down. He hoped at once it wasn&#39;t his daughter Lisa. She...he didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d explain to her that &quot;Bio-Dad Became A Jock Teen Again&quot;...<br />
<br />
...But if anything the awkwardness that was induced was higher than expected. Because rather than Lisa, it was Carl that walked through the elevator doors. Dressed in his new apparel and trying his best to give the appearance of a boss rather than a nervous teenager. He was...half succeeding. A moment&#39;s silence, followed by Carl speaking up, &quot;E-Ethan...? I need to speak to you about our conduct in my office earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean,&quot; Ethan started as he walked over, &quot;When you fucked me, Carl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I mean it wasn&#39;t like...&quot; Carl sighed when he saw Ethan cross his arms and wryly grin a little, &quot;Yeah. Yeah it was...about that. Our...odd relation when Melissa came up there. I wasn&#39;t expecting it. I wasn&#39;t expecting a three way. I expected sex with just Melissa. But then...you were there too. And I...I found myself...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Liking it,&quot; Ethan stated.<br />
<br />
A brief pause before Ethan continued, &quot;Carl, there&#39;s nothing unusual about a man who likes women also liking men. That is behavior that has been traced back to Rome, Greece and further still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that, Ethan,&quot; Carl shook his head, and blushed a little, &quot;It&#39;s just...I never knew...just how MUCH I&#39;d like it. I mean, I definitely want Melissa, and women in general. But then there&#39;s you. And there&#39;s this guy I met at lunch with Melissa. Who I&#39;d...really like to uhh---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d like to try something with him, see if he&#39;s up for it.&quot; Ethan suggested, and both at once blushed a little bit. Ethan looked at Carl, who seemed to have drawn closer a little bit, &quot;Well, you handled yourself pretty well earlier. I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl smiled, and nodded slowly, &quot;Thanks, Ethan and uhh...umm...&quot; Carl looked around, their closeness was tremendously awkward for both in that moment. Carl couldn&#39;t quite find his words to articulate how Ethan made him feel. But there was one thing he could do to articulate that better for him than words - Carl moved forward and kissed Ethan awkwardly on the lips. It was tamer, less overtly passionate than the kisses during the threesome, but it thrilled Carl nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Ethan stepped back once he felt confident the kiss was done. &quot;Have it outta your system?&quot; Ethan asked, and then said, &quot;Whatever happens I&#39;ll be around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah!&quot; Carl smiled, and then said, &quot;Okay, so, I think I&#39;d like to try having Thomas Arnoult over, see where we go from there. Can you uh, back me up when I go hang out with him some time?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ethan wondered if there would be any effect from a person regressed by Chronos possibly engaging sexually with someone who wasn&#39;t, but that was putting a lot of chickens forward. But he decided considering Carl was still his boss, he did need to help him out a bit. &quot;Sure thing, just be careful if things go in that certain direction. After all, none of of have gotten involved sexually with someone who wasn&#39;t inoculated with the Chronos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl just nodded, and said, &quot;See ya later, Ethan, looking forward to that uh, hang out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, man.&quot; And here Ethan was - Carl just smooched him again, he was close to finding out some more about the Chronos&#39; effects on the human body. And he needed some new clothes. Fuck, but these test subject clothes were scratchy and difficult to like. He needed something a little more fitting for the newly minted jock. And hey, maybe he&#39;d get to engage with the opposite sex there just as much as he was engaging with the opposite and same sex here.<br />
<br />
With that Ethan decided to go try and get something done...</p>
