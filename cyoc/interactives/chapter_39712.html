<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Mendes looked at the spell book in his hands. He knew that it was responsible for his current situation. It stood to reason that it could return things to normal. Though how was he going to return to normal? It seemed like the spells themselves were gibberish and the English text didn't make sense. One page seemed to describe alternate realities. Could he have been sent to a different reality? That seemed to make some sense. How did this book come to be here though? Maybe it existed in all the realities.<br />
<br />
After reading some more Mr. Mendes realized that there was only this one book in all the realities. &quot;So how did it come to be in this reality?&quot; Mr. Mendes wondered. &quot;If I'm interpreting this right this book will follow whoever is holding it into different realities. The only thing is that I wasn't holding it, Ric was. Could Ric be in this reality with me? How will I know if he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Mendes starts to feel pressure building up in between his legs. He couldn't be sure but he thought that he needed to pee. Since the house had become more real it stood to reason that there would be a bathroom in here. After searching the house, during which time the pressure continued to build, he found the bathroom. By that time he was holding his crotch like a little girl needing to pee real bad and he knew that he needed to pee.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mendes entered the bathroom and headed straight for the toilet. He had barely gotten his pants and panties down and sat on the toilet when the pressure became too much to hold back anymore and he peed as a girl for the first time in his life. He found it strange to feel piss coming from between his legs instead of from his dick. As soon as he was done he grabbed some toilet paper and wiped. He was mildly surprised when the toilet actually flushed when he tried it. After that he went back to the library to see if he could return things to normal.<br />
<br />
In the library Mr. Mendes picked up the book and looked through it. He found the index and spotted what he thought would fix this. He hoped that it would fix this but he had no way to really know since the spell itself was gibberish. He figured that he would have to concentrate on himself as he was, Josh, and Ric in order for the spell to work. Taking a deep breath he began to say the spell though he found it hard to pronounce the words.<br />
<br />
Pleasure washed over Mr. Mendes as the energy hit him. He looked at himself as his body began to fade. The spell was working. Everything went white and then came right back to what it was. He looked at his body and saw that it was just the same as before. &quot;Why didn't I return to normal?&quot; he wondered.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Josh/Amelia watched in amazement as a girl appeared in the chair opposite him/her. He/she thought that the girl was about his/her age, maybe a year or two older. She had the same long brown hair that was also braided, the same color eyes, and her face looked like Josh/Amelia's only a little older. The girl had on a yellow dress that looked like Josh/Amelia's. The girl looked down at herself and reached a hand behind her head and brought her braid around to where she could see it. Her eyes were wide with surprise and she let her hand fall. Josh/Amelia could see that the girl's hand was doing something underneath the table and she suddenly asked &quot;What the fuck!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh/Amelia's mother was standing behind the girl with her back turned to her. She whirled around and said &quot;ANNA MARIE THOMPSON! Where did you learn that word!?!&quot; This caused the girl to jump in surprise and let out a little squeal.<br />
<br />
New memories were telling Josh/Amelia that this girl was his/her eight year old sister. He/she had always wanted to be like her so his/her mother started him/her on the pills that would eventually turn him/her into a genetic girl like his/her sister.<br />
<br />
After a few moments in which Anna didn't say anything their mother said &quot;Well I'm waiting young lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As Ric was sitting at the table he felt a pleasurable feeling wash over him. Something was going on and he soon figured out what it was as he saw that his body was fading. Someone had found the book and was using it. As soon as his body had faded everything became white. In a moment color came back and he realized that he was still sitting at the table only there was a little girl sitting across from him and he thought that she was about six or seven.<br />
<br />
Ric's body felt a bit odd and he looked down. To his surprise he was wearing a yellow dress that came down to just above his knees. The top part looked like a scrunchy material that started just below his armpits and ended around his midriff. He could see that he was wearing yellow shoes. Something tickled his neck as he looked down and he brought his hand up to grab it. Bringing it around he saw that it was a braid of long brown hair, his hair. 'What is this?' he thought to himself as he let his hand drop.<br />
<br />
Ric was surprised by all of this but he thought he'd better check to see if his dick was still there. He lifted up the hem of the dress and when he didn't see a bulge in his pastel yellow panties he put his hand down them hoping to confirm what he thought. He didn't know which he would prefer, being a girl or being a boy that dressed like a girl. He didn't feel anything where his dick was suppose to be and exploring further down to between his legs he felt what he knew had to be the genitals of a girl. At least he wasn't a boy dressing like a girl but it still surprised him and, without thinking first, he asked &quot;What the fuck!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ANNA MARIE THOMPSON!&quot; a voice Ric recognized as his mother's said behind him causing him to jump and squeal. &quot;Where did you learn that word!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric/Anna didn't know what he/she was going to say. How could he/she explain that he/she was really a thirteen year old boy when his/her mother clearly knew him/her as a girl. And why was his/her mother home when she was suppose to be out of town for the summer. He/she looked at the girl across from him/her and his/her memories told him/her that this was his/her seven year old sister Amelia who was born a boy but wanted to be like her big sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm waiting young lady&quot; Ric/Anna's mother said.<br />
<br />
What will Ric/Anna tell his/her mother?</p>
