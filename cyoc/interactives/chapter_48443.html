<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby, who was starting to think of himself as Aimee no how much he tried to fight it, started into the mirror. Reflected back was someone who looked both male and female and appeared to be ten years of age. It had been five days since his sister had made her wish, but for Bobby it had only been about three days...for he was measuring time from the point he had first lost his penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
Shifting the fleece shirt-like jacket about, disturbed that he not only was wearing more and more girl's clothes, but that he was also enjoying it somewhat, he flicked his head, sending the now shoulder length brown hair back. Looking down at the white cotton panties he was wearing, bobby asked himself, &quot;What did I do to deserve this,&quot; as his thoughts settled on the fact that he now had the privates of a girl, rather than the privates of a boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing,&quot; a voice behind him asked. &quot;You're supposed to be getting ready for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, Bobby looked at his and Abby's babysitter, Becca. Down the hall he could hear Becca's younger sister, Stacy, and Abby playing. Drawing him back to the here and now, Becca picked him off and setting him down on the floor, she asked, &quot;Where are your pyjama pants, Aimee?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how best to answer, Bobby instead choose to stand there and after a couple of seconds, Becca bent down and reaching under the sink, she pulled out a Dry Nights...something Bobby was hoping she would forget that he was supposed to wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leg,&quot; Becca said as she reached up and pulled the underwear he was wearing down.<br />
<br />
Lifting up his leg, Bobby repeated the process and soon he was wearing nothing but the fleece shirt-like jacket. Before he could do anything, Becca announced, &quot;I am not going to put up with your antics tonight.&quot; and then she grasped Bobby and gently laid him down on the floor.<br />
<br />
There, Bobby had no choice but to lay there while Becca put what he thought of as a diaper on him. Afterward, she stood and disappeared for a moment. A Bobby slowly stood, the babysitter returned, carrying the fleece pyjama pants that matched the top half. Handing them to Bobby, Becca said, &quot;Put them on,&quot; and turning, she left Bobby to finish dressing.<br />
<br />
Afterward, Bobby headed for his room, which he shared with Abby. Looking briefly at his sister, again asking himself &quot;What did I do to deserve this,&quot; he noted with some glee that she appeared to be transforming as well and looked to be about six years old.<br />
<br />
Turning toward his bed, he briefly glanced at Stacy and noted that she too was also changing and appeared to be the same age as Abby. Climbing into his bed, Bobby wondered what sort of change he would awaken to tomorrow as he thought back to when Aunt Andi had first arrived and how he had awoken the next morning to find himself in a different bed and that he and his sister now shared a room together.<br />
<br />
As he lay in his bed, Abby and Stacy giggled and talked quietly amongst themselves. After a bit, Becca came in and told them, &quot;All right you two. Bedtime. You're keeping Aimee awake,&quot; and then turned out the light to emphasize the point.<br />
<br />
Looking at her sister, who was already asleep, Abby climbed into her bed as Stacy laid down upon a sleeping bag on the floor. As she lay in her bed, Abby wondered what her brother was thinking and what he thought about having to wear a Dry Night when he went to bed. She thought about the note and wondered where it was...seeing as it had disappeared about two days ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think your aunt doesn't want anyone in her room,&quot; Stacy asked in a quiet whisper from where she was lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
Distracted from her thoughts, Abby shrugged and then realising how silly this might be seeing as nobody could see her in the semidarkness and then replied, &quot;I dunno. Maybe she just likes her privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever wondered?&quot; Stacy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wondered what,&quot; Abby replied in a sleepy voice, sleep threatening to engulf her consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Stacy said. &quot;Maybe she has something to hide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what,&quot; Abby asked, suddenly very much awake and wondering what her aunt could possibly have to hide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another, &quot;I dunno,&quot; from Stacy and then after a moment, the girl asked, &quot;Do you want to find out. We could make it a bit of an adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How,&quot; Abby asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Stacy started, thinking carefully. &quot;First we have to make it past the guard...who just so happens to be my older sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what.&quot;<br />
<br />
A pause and then Stacy replied, &quot;We'll come to that point when we reach it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting up in her bed, Abby slid out and adjusting her nightgown, she sat down next to Stacy. Looking at the other girl, she whispered, &quot;Okay. But we need to make sure we don't wake up Aimee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Stacy stood and crept across the room and opening the door a crack, she peered out. After a moment, she whispered back to Abby, &quot;The coast is clear,&quot; and pushing the door open a bit more, she tip-toed out and across the hall.<br />
<br />
Behind her, Abby followed. As Stacy pushed the door across the way open, Abby realised that this was her first time entering the room since she and her brother's room had become one and the same. Stepping in what was now a guest bedroom, Abby looked about, slightly disappointed to see that it was nothing more than a guest bedroom that her aunt kept tidy.<br />
<br />
Before, Stacy was opening the walk-in closet and entering it. As she did this, Abby walked toward the nightstand and began looking at the various objects stacked on the top. Behind her, Stacy began going, &quot;Pssst,&quot; and when Abby finally turned around, Stacy held up a book and asked, &quot;What do you suppose this is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Abby replied, &quot;I dunno,&quot; and walking across the moonlit room, she peered at the book her friend held in her hands.<br />
<br />
Reaching out, Abby touched the surface, noted that it was cool, and then slowly opened the book. Inside, the first page's covered in words that Abby and Stacy couldn't make boots to bonnets of what it was saying.<br />
<br />
Flicking a page, Abby saw more and more of the same. Taking the book from her friend, she flipped more of the pages and looking at Stacy, she asked, &quot;What is all this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy looked over her friends shoulder and stated, &quot;It looks like something from those Harry Potter movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling silently at this, Abby said, &quot;You mean that this could cause a bit of magick to happen if I read from it. If so, I wonder what would happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy reached passed her friend and whispered, &quot;I don't know,&quot; as she flipped a few more pages.<br />
<br />
Placing her hand on a page, Abby whispered, &quot;Let's try this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from her friend, and placing the book on the floor, Abby looked at the page. After a bit of trying to sound the words out in her mind, she began to speak slowly and carefully. At the exact moment she finished reading, there was a loud crack, a bright flash of light and a force flung her backwards.<br />
<br />
Sitting up, scared, Abby looked about. Noting that Stacy was suddenly missing, she called out into the dark, &quot;Stacy,&quot; as a strange feeling washed over her.</p>
