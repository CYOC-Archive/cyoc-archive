<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Candace gazed at her now smooth back a realization of her situation hit. Grabbing  the wallet from her purse, which was the only article of clothing she had kept with, she quickly produced her license. “Oh crap,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
Candace’s license now showed that she was only 17 years old. Looking at the top of of it she could see in bright red letters she would not turn 18 for another year and was four years away from being 21. “Damn it,” she groaned. “Nice going Candace not only are you a teenager in need of a fake ID your a freaking minor again.” Sighing she looked in the mirror and immediately covered her nude body. “Brilliant idea Candace,” she grumbled. “Your a naked kid in a hall of mirrors so now what?” Looking backwards she tried to see where she had put her clothing only to discover they were nowhere to be found. Sighing she glanced in the mirror, amazed by what she saw. <br />
<br />
Candace’s face had lost a great deal of maturity, becoming less angular and more rounded. Looking at her hair she noticed it had grown out just past her shoulders and glowed with youthful energy. Amazed she now touched her face, surprised at how innocent and young she looked. As she looked over the rest of her body she was even more amazed at how skinny she was. The girls waist and stomach her flat, Candace almost convinced herself she could see her ribs at this point. As she studied the rest of her body she noticed that while her breasts were extremely perky they appeared to have lost a cup size. Squeezing them together she frowned at this realization as she now looked at her rear. The curvy ass she had become so accustomed to had flattened, giving her a lean teenage look, even Candace’s legs now looked a little on the skinny side as they firmed and thinned.<br />
<br />
“Geez I was skinny,” she grumbled. “But I do look good, can’t believe I was self conscious at this age.” Sighing she now thought about her options. No matter what happened if she exited she would no longer be an adult. She silently cursed herself for not paying closer attention as college was now a year or two away. At least as a college student she would of had some freedom. As a high school student her freedoms were very limited and if she kept going those freedoms would dwindle, along with her. Curiously she now wondered if she had gotten any shorter? She was undeniably a kid now but had she been shorter when she was 17? As she pondered this idea she noticed notches on the wall next to the mirror, notches that clearly marked height. Shrugging her shoulder she now stood with her back to the wall and her feet flat on the floor. Placing her hand on the top of her head she held it in place as she stepped back.<br />
<br />
“Five six,” she said quietly. “Well least I haven’t gotten any shorter....yet.” Looking at the path ahead she sighed, she had already gotten this young, why not keep going. Taking a deep breath she slowly lifted her foot, knowing as soon as she stepped forward she wouldn’t be 17 anymore. Taking the step she now started on her journey again.<br />
<br />
Candace proceeded slowly down the hall, keeping a critical eye on herself. As she walked she was astounded that she was able to perceive the changes that took place as she walked. Candace’s face was definitely becoming younger, looking less mature with each passing step. Soft innocent features framed by dark hair that hung past her shoulders. Even her eyes looked larger and more innocent with a cute button nose. Candace’s face wasn’t the only thing changing as she studied her body. Candace’s breasts were definitely in b cup range now and still growing smaller, much to her chagrin. As she walked she noticed a birthday card hanging from the mirror. Grabbing she read it.<br />
<br />
“Happy sweet 16,” she said quietly, noticing her voice was changing as well, sounding higher and more youthful. Glancing at her license she was astounded to see she still had it. The issue date said she had received it today, if she kept going though chances were that would change. Looking around she saw that as far as clothing was concerned she still had nothing, her choices were now leave as a naked 16 year old girl or continue and hope for the best. While not exactly thrilled about either option a feeling told her in the back of her head that if she continued she would find something to wear.<br />
<br />
“Can’t you cut a girl a break,” she whined, hoping someone would listen. Silence was returned as a response causing her to groan in typical teenage fashion. “Ugh fine but I better not be stuck with a curfew when this is done.” Stomping forwards she continued knowing with each passing step she was going further back in her high school career. As she finally reached a fork in the road she saw a note. Picking it up she read what it said.<br />
<br />
“Welcome freshman class,” it read. Candace’s eyes bulged as she read those words, she was a freshman girl once more. As she looked at her features she saw a waifish girl with coltish legs and the beginning of curves in her hips. Candace could see her breasts were now just small b’s while her face looked round and childish. She didn’t need to look at her license to know how old she was, she was 14 years old once again. Looking at the two paths she could see two sets of clothes laid out for her. On the right side Candace beheld a private school girls uniform. A button down blouse, pleated skirt, knee socks and saddle shoes sat next to a pair of colorful teen underwear. To the left Candace could see a pair of jeans and a T-shirt with sneakers and socks, her outfit of choice when she was a teen. <br />
<br />
“So I get to change my future yet again,” she said as she put the underwear on. “Go left and I’m back in mumbled high school. Go right and I’m in private school. And I’m guessing I need to put the clothes on to complete the choice.” Candace sighed, taking a deep breath she grabbed the private school uniform putting it on. After putting on the blouse and skirt she stared at her reflection, she was every bit the private school girl. It astounded her how young she appeared and she had the nagging feeling her reflection didn’t seem right. Standing next to a tape measure placed next to the mirror her thoughts were confirmed. “Five four,” she whispered. She had shrunk two inches. Gazing at the young girl in the mirror she was astounded that she had ever been so young. Looking around she looked at the saddle shoes and knee socks, crinkling her nose. “FYI,” she yelled. “There’s no way in hell im wearing those ugly ass shoes.” Staring at herself the barefoot freshman now thought about one other regret in her life.<br />
<br />
The summer before freshman year Candace had a boyfriend named Danny. Danny was a little older than her at the time and was a bit of a rebel. Danny and Candace would get into trouble doing stupid kid stuff all day before hanging out at the beach at night. It was during one of those nights that their makeout session went a bit further than Candace had anticipated. Candace thought she loved Danny and let him take her virginity. It wasn’t til after that she realized Danny was a jerk who had used her. The 16 year old boy dumped Candace the next day and spread the word he had popped her cherry when she arrived at school two months later. The experience had hurt Candace greatly but in the end it also made her stronger. Candace was forced to grow up quickly and deal with choices but a part of her wished she hadn’t had to go through that, her only conciliation was the fact Danny ended up going to jail when he was 19 and had been in and out since. Candace smirked every time she read the crime section and saw Danny get arrested yet again. It was a small victory to know she was better off than someone else.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath she now needed to decide what to do. Should she go back and reclaim her virginity or stay put as a freshman girl in a private school.</p>
