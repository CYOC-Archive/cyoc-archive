<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sh, Dirk, it&#39;s reading its dog tag with its fingers,&quot; Master whispered. <br />
<br />
Dirk was silent, and focused his night vision on Chad&#39;s face. He watched as Chad carefully ran his index finger over the engraved letters. Chad mouthed &quot;Q&quot; as he traced the first letter. &quot;B&quot; as he traced the second.<br />
<br />
Chad whispered, &quot;QB? Quarterback &quot; His fingers continued to trace the letters. His mouthing was less distinct, &quot;Q,U,A,R,T,E,R,B,I,I,?,T,C,H?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s face was the picture of consternation,  confusion, and terror, as he read and reread the dog tag with his finger. He whispered, &quot;QB Quarterbitch?&quot; Then as it dawned on him what his new name meant, he repeated it loudly, with anger, &quot;Quarterbitch! Dirk&#39;s gotta be kiddi-&quot;<br />
<br />
ZAP.<br />
<br />
The shock collar activated. Chad collapsed writhing in the mud. A minute or so later, Chad was up on his knees.<br />
<br />
The Master pointed,  and said loudly, &quot;See how much it likes its new name, Dirk?&quot;<br />
<br />
A leather clad index finger touched Chad&#39;s mushroom tip on his erect penis.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s jaw dropped as he realized he was sporting a boner after speaking its new name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, Qube!&quot; Dirk said. He stepped up to  Chad planting a boot I&#39;m between his hands, and pressing his bare leg against Chad&#39;s muddy chest. He tousled the dirty hair on Qube&#39;s head. Then snapped a leash to the heavy collar already secured to Chad&#39;s neck. His position prevented Chad from standing.<br />
<br />
The Master&#39;s other slaves moved silently into position around the pig pen. Dirk pulled on the leash at such a pace that Chad had to follow scrambling on all fours.<br />
<br />
The Master followed with a satisfied smile. Both the new pups were oblivious to the fact that Chad would have been sporting a boner no matter what. After years as an inanimate, prolonged erection upon humanitarian was a common reaction. The fact that the heavy shock collar was lined with concentrated topical hormonal chemicals that had started leaching into Chad&#39;s bloodstream through his skin the moment it came into contact with his bare skin just augmented what came naturally.  The shock from the collar triggered the erection. That was part of the training too. Pain and pleasure.<br />
<br />
The master recalled when he explained the importance of name in training. An Alpha pup could have its human name, but Beta Pups had to be renamed. The name had to redefine the pup in its own mind as a bitch boy. He had suggested BB or Bitchboi for Chad. Then he explained if the pup had a human nickname that could be employed but redefined or altered slightly for its new role that would be even better.<br />
<br />
&quot;For example, Butch becomes Bitch, or BJ becomes Blowjob,&quot; he had said.<br />
<br />
Dirk had run with the suggestion, &quot;Singlet Stud? Chadcunt, Chadboi, Bitch boy...&quot; The master ignored the lame initial attempts. Bitch Man Or Cunt for Big Man On Campus, made the Master contribute,  &quot;Good idea, but shorter. Preferably just one or two syllables for everyday name, but it can be short for a longer name. What did its former teammates call it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Qube was born. Quarterback bitch, Quarter boi, quarter bum...eventually the alpha decided on Quarter Bitch.  Nor perfect, Master could change it later, but Dirk needed positive reinforcement as part of its training.  He smiled once Dirk and Chad were in proper shape they would be a fine addition to his kennel.<br />
<br />
Qube remained filthy, and would do so until it was washed by Dirk. But he motioned to his slaves to wipe the mud off Dirk&#39;s  bare skin. Keeping Dirk clean was part of Dirk&#39;s training,  and the young pup actually thought it was training to be a master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, Qube. Keep up, stay on all fours, Qube. That&#39;s a good boy, Qube. That&#39;s my Quarterbitch!&quot; Dirk gushed.<br />
<br />
Chad was silent, moving on all fours as fast as it could on the muddy terrain, as Dirk led him out of the pig pen. The master&#39;s slaves closed the gate behind them. <br />
<br />
Dirk was sporting wood now too. The master left nothing to chance. Domination usually produced arousal in the dominator, but the master left nothing to chance. His slaves coated the inside of all the leather gear that Dirk was now wearing with the same topical agent as in Chad&#39;s shock collar. He glanced down at his own tented crotch. His bulge was not chemically induced.<br />
<br />
They were almost to the barn. A hot sudsy tub awaited them. Dirk would wash his beta. The master&#39;s slaves would help. The Master grinned. He paused as he contemplated his plans coming together. <br />
<br />
When Dirk reached the barn with Chad still on all fours, he turned to see the master was at least 50 yards behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Masters, you coming in with us?&quot; Dirk shouted.<br />
<br />
The master cringed. He would correct Dirkdawg later. He had told Dirk his name was Mr. Masters when they first made contact. It wasn&#39;t.  Dirk had noticed the name painted at the farm entrance,  and asked Master about it. The master had said truthfully that the family farm bore his grandfather&#39;s surname. He neglected to reveal that it was also his surname. Dirk assumed maternal grandfather,  as the master intended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, Dirk. Slaves help Dirk wash up the puppy! I will join you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
The master turned by a fence post in a manner suggesting he was going to relieve himself. <br />
<br />
Chad started to stand, but Dirk pushed him back to all fours, &quot;Down, Qube,&quot; then, &quot;come, Qube,&quot; as he went into the barn. Chad followed on all fours. A half dozen slaves moved around the perimeter of Dirk and Chad. They were ever silent, ever watchful. They knew what their master expected. <br />
<br />
The barn was well lit. There was huge tub on the floor in front of a chainlink enclosed stall. Dirk and Chad glanced up, and read the fleshly painted sign, &quot;DOG KENNEL&quot;.</p>
