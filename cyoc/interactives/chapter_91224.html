<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite being caught in the throes of her self-pleasuring, Clarice McDowell had seen sense in keeping some pain for her transformations she would use on herself, not least because by the sixth ring, she finally paid attention to the phone.  Cursing the poor timing on whoever saw fit to call her at that moment, she reached for the phone, her partially slid-down blouse caught her arm before she pulled it off before she could finally answer the call.  <br />
<br />
“Hello?”  She asked over the line, her voice having taken on a husky, raspy tone with her modified vocal cords, voice box, and mouth.  <br />
<br />
“It’s about time.”  She recognised the voice right away, it belonged to her own Boss, Eric Sanchez.  “I was beginning to wonder if you would even bother to answer.”  <br />
<br />
“M-My apologies.  I was…busy.”  She replied, honestly enough.  <br />
<br />
“I can guess.  You are to report to me, in my office, in ten minutes.”  He instructed her bluntly.  <br />
<br />
“Ten minutes?”  Clarice knew what that meant, she’d not only have to leave right that moment, but as the Lizardess she currently was.  “I can do that, but please understand that…”  <br />
<br />
“…I don’t care what state you’re in.”  Eric cut her off.  “I want you here in ten minutes, and that is final.”  He hung up at that point, leaving Clarice in a decidedly uneasy state.  <br />
<br />
And not without good reason.  Usually, he’d be satisfied enough with a written report or phone call with regards to the operations and the employees, that he wanted her in his own office to speak to her personally, the rarity of the occurrence was buy itself sufficient to leave a small, yet notable fear in the pits of her stomach.  To add to her list, she knew as well as anyone else who worked here that to revert herself from her preset instructions would take at least five minutes to programme in then run, which would mean that she wouldn’t be able to make it to his office in time.  <br />
<br />
“No choice then.”  She concluded as she picked up her handbag with her key cards and such in it, slipping on a thick Royal Purple overcoat with a pair of knee-height boots that lacked a substantial heel to them (a pair she’d secured to cover for scenarios such as the one she was in) before exiting her quarters and power-walking her way along the corridors.  <br />
<br />
Getting her coat buttoned up as she walked, Clarice was forced to leave a few open, at the base so her tail had enough room, and the top where her larger breasts kept her from pulling the ends together, leaving her showing off a massive amount of cleavage that left nothing to the imagination.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
Leaning back in his specially-adapted leather chair, the 386 cm form of Eric Sanchez waited.  A long wide snout was pulled back in a smile as he checked the security cameras showing Clarice McDowell heading his way, and the form she was in as she walked.  <br />
<br />
A blend between American Alligator and Human, dark grey scales dominated though some cream could be made out on his lower jaw.  Only his hands could be made out as well, the rest covered in a custom-tailored business suit though that didn’t hide the raw power he possessed.  Or the bulge that rested between his legs.  Five months, he’d sustained himself in his current form and he’d long since grown very used to it, to the point where he really didn’t see himself switching back.  <br />
<br />
It wasn’t without drawbacks but most of it he’d had taken care of, from everything in his own office and - admittedly luxurious - quarters being built to accommodate his large and heavy body comfortably, to a range of tailor-made suits and other clothes to fit his current form.  As for taking care of more personal needs, his position allowed him access to ALL the employee and guest files, and permitted him to make whatever adjustments required.  <br />
<br />
He was far from stupid though, this was not something he would actually tell anyone working under him, even if they at the very least suspected that he could.  No, much better that they fear the possibility without knowing it, that being perfect for keeping them in line in his mind.  <br />
<br />
Back to business though, he had two things he needed to speak with Clarice McDowell about.  One, the reason she’d modified Amy Campbell’s Employee File, while she had the right to do so, he still needed a reason for this act.  And Two, his experience had given him an idea, to have at least some of the employees of this resort maintain their hybrid forms 24/7, mainly those who’d opted for a bipedal form such as himself and Clarice, whom he’d have as one of those who stayed in such a way.  To himself, it made for a great mode of advertisement of the resort and it’s capabilities, and would certainly ensure that things remained…interesting.  Then, he supposed, he could take care of a desire of his own.  <br />
<br />
Further thoughts on these matters would have to wait for now, as he heard a light rapping on his door.  “Enter.”  He rumbled out, the blue-scaled Lizard-Woman form of Clarice entering his office, now clear just how much of a hurry she’d been in, with her being slightly short on breath, and her coat not properly buttoned, the ones from the base of her breasts upwards ignored it seemed to him.  <br />
<br />
“Put your coat over there.”  He pointed to a coat hanger to her left.  “And have a seat, we have, certain matters to discuss.”</p>
