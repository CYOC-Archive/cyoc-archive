<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Right boys, time to wake up&quot; came that deep bellowing voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened&quot; Eric moaned as he sat himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I&#39;ve been hit by a truck&quot; Matt rubbed his head. Looking down, his eyes widened &quot;Um, why are we naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Found you that way&quot; the orcblood replied &quot;tele-mag does that. Along with turning your mind to mush for a few hours. Don&#39;t know why you boys were messing with tele spells, but that mag is best saved for emergencies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tele-mag?&quot; Eric replied <br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;course, ain&#39;t nothing else that would leave two handsome, naked boys in the middle of the road like that. Well, I can think of a few other things, but - usually tele-mag&#39;s ta&#39; blame.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric noticed the bull man staring at his crotch, and quickly moved to cover himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got an extra pair of clothes one of you can borrow, Theo&#39;s got another.&quot; the orcblood said. &quot;Once you&#39;re all dressed, my brother can make us something to eat. I know tele-mag empties the stomach quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So-uh-where are we?&quot; Matt asked as he looked around the pastoral landscape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Dicktin!&quot; Grunted the bull. <br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Dick</i>-ton?&quot; Eric said in confusion. His muscular form flexed subconsciously, as if physically trying to ward away the gay sounding name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er- yea. Dickton&quot; Said the orcblood. &quot;Names what it sounds like. Named for the founder Reynard who-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude was packing&quot; The bull interrupted, His hoofed hand gently squeezed his croctch in emphasis &quot;Even for a vulpine his cock was known well beyond the edges of our county.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orcblood ginned, eyes catching Matt&#39;s &quot; Theo&#39;s right. There&#39;s even <i>songs</i> about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A century later.&quot; the bull added. <br />
<br />
Matt opened his mouth to respond. Then decided against it. While his best friend was gay, Alex was fairly private about his sexuality. Matt didn&#39;t know how to react to a guy, let alone a pair of inhuman guys, so openly discussing cock. His uncertainty broke into a blush as he noticed the orcblood&#39;s eyes give him a once over before once again locking on his own. Matt quickly glanced away, hand rubbing behind his head in uncertainty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya ask me, Vulpines cheat.&quot; The bull continued as an aire of mock grandiocity began to color the words  &quot; If I had a knot like that, I&#39;d have <i>epics</i> written about my cock. Prostates would <i>quiver at the sight of me </i>! The king would send herald&#39;s to <i>sing </i> the pleasures of my cock to the five lords of the realm!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s body tightened a bit more. This cock talk was getting a bit much for his guarded masculinity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Course we &#39;taurs more than make up for it.&quot; His eye locked on Eric&#39;s &quot; Vulpines might have knots, but we bulls have <i> length </i>&quot; he slowly stretched the syllables of the last word as his thumb and fore finger dragged along the sides of his cock, the pressure tightening the fabric of his loin cloth flush against his length. Eric couldn&#39;t help but stare, jaw dropping slightly at the massive cock revealed through the fabric. <br />
<br />
Blushing in discomfort, Eric glanced away. <br />
<br />
Theo grinned, giving the tip of his cock a few light strokes as he enjoyed the  nervousness. He always enjoyed toying with new boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to get used to Theo, he&#39;s always got cock on the brain&quot; the orcblood said, revealing a toothy grin. &quot;By the way, I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve been properly introduced. Name&#39;s Roy, and as you&#39;ve learned, my stud of a bull over here is Theo&quot; Roy&#39;s arm playfully wrapped around Theo&#39;s hulking shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er-name&#39;s Matt and this is Eric, my Roomate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pleasure.&quot; Theo said, nodding to the boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Theo continued, his hulking form leaping from the cart with a loud thump. &quot;Let&#39;s get you boys inside and into some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cael will be thrilled to have some guests&quot; Roy said. <br />
<br />
Eric and Matt exchanged a glance before hoping out to follow the men towards a distant cabin. Both were uncertain, a little put off by the pair&#39;s open sexuality, and in the back of their minds they wondered where Sam had landed. <br />
<br />
_______________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<i> miles away </i><br />
<br />
&quot;The boy&#39;s not supposed to be here.&quot;  The elven apothecaries age worn voice creaked through the dark of the room. Before him a thick blue candle waved silently in the air, its light illuminating the fatherly orcblood and his human mate. &quot;This world&#39;s not intended for him. It&#39;s for someone else.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sam lay sleeping by the wall, his muddled mind calmed by a sedative.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean <i> meant for </i> this world&#39;s not meant for anyone. It&#39;s just the world.&quot; the human asked, annoyed at the apothecaries&#39; cryptic words. He always hated magic types. The arcane always felt so unpredictable, uncertain. As a farmer, he preferred control, while as a human, he resented the fact that his race could not wield the art. <br />
<br />
&quot;Each world is meant for many people. This world is meant for you and your husband. It&#39;s meant for your sons. It&#39;s meant for this boy&#39;s brother.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;His brother?&quot; the orcblood asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the brother. This world is perfectly suited to his ....sexual needs. Needs unmet in his brithrealm. The god&#39;s in their glory, decided to give him a blessing and send him here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The candle crackled, the flame glinting on the elf&#39;s clouded eyes. &quot;Sex is looked on differently in other worlds. Frowned upon . In this boy&#39;s world there is even something strange called a woman, an integral part of a mated pair. A pairing of two men is rare and sometimes forbidden. It is a sorry place.&quot; <br />
<br />
The orcblood glanced over at the human, uncertain if the man truly had the sight, or if his words were a senile fiction. <br />
<br />
&quot;But in our world&quot; the old elf grinned, his voice soft and almost musical &quot;We love sex. Celebrate intimacy. Enjoy exploring another man&#39;s body. &quot;<br />
<br />
The orcblood&#39;s cock stretched slightly, the words conjuring the image of his husband&#39;s naked form. He blinked and cleared the thoughts. Now was not the time. <br />
<br />
The candle sparked. <br />
<br />
&quot;The brother, it seems, came for more than just sex. He came for family.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shoots of blue burst from the candle tip. The elf smiled, wrinkles crossing his face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;In time he will find it, but his new family wouldn&#39;t be complete without what remained of his old. And so the god&#39;s brought this boy and his companions here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The flame flickered brighter, its size out stripping the normal abilities of its wick. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is a price for this blessing, however. The boy and his companions will have to change. They are not suited to our world. In time, the god&#39;s will reshape them, matching their forms and desires to our people and culture. The brother&#39;s form will also change, though his mind is already paired to this realm.&quot; <br />
<br />
The human glanced at his husband; the apothecary&#39;s word&#39;s sounding increasingly unhinged. <br />
<br />
The elf&#39;s voice raised suddenly an intensity filling his opaque pupils &quot;The god&#39;s have spoken!&quot; Suddenly, the candle burst into a crackling shower of light. An in an instant, it and the old elf, were gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is why I never mess with magic&quot; the human grumbled &quot;Too uncertain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You humans, always complaining about us mag-types.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just stating a fact. I ain&#39;t never seen magic behave as intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; How long before the boy wakes?&quot; the orcblood switched the subject, not wanting to get in another argument about magic. <br />
<br />
&quot;The old man said to give him another hour, let his body work away the tele-mag&quot;<br />
<br />
The orcblood looked over at the sleeping boy. His chest gently rose and fell, the sedative doing its work. As the boy exhaled, the orcblood noticed something strange. Just above his lower lip, emerged the tips of two pointed teeth.</p>
