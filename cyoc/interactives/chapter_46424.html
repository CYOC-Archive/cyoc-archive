<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">PETE'S POV:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you okay in there? I heard some weird noises,&quot; I said, knocking on the door of my weird fag roommate, Andy. I don't know what his deal was, he's like, always fucking jacking off or something in there.<br />
<br />
In the back of my mind something said, wait, no, Andy's your bud, the runt in the group...<br />
<br />
But no, why would anyone ever call Andy a runt? If I had to give him anything he had a killer bud and he was even taller than me, which was saying a lot, since I was 6'3&quot;. I was the alpha male down at the auto shop. You know, the hairiest, the spittinest, trash talkinest. Even though I'd let myself go a little I still had kind of a bod.<br />
<br />
Andy opened the door and gave me one of those lecherous grin he's always giving me. He was totally nude and... covered in cum?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross, dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're-you're&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, it's just cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy threw open the door and I could see his body in all it's glory. I'd seen it before but it still kinda took me by surprise. <br />
<br />
&quot;What, you like something you see?&quot; Andy said.<br />
<br />
I felt a momentary dizziness, swaying back and forth, and righted myself on the door frame. My lithe body was nothing compared to his but at least I stayed fit. I looked up at him. He was only a couple of inches taller. I felt shy, all of the sudden. Andy always made me feel confused. It was true that I was always looking for excuses to check him out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I was just making sure you were okay, Andy.&quot; I smiled tentatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Andy said, flexing his biceps casually. I felt myself tenting a little. &quot;The offer still stands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy looked me up and down, and I shivered a little under his gaze and looked down. I felt that weird dizzy fuzziness again, and when I looked up, up, up at Andy... Andy, who was so tall and handsome and cute and his muscles, oh my god, those muscles, I just wanted to lick them, and worship them, but I was only 17, and I was like, way shorter than him, like 5'9, I had this cute brown hair though, all short and cute. I just came out to my parents and they kicked me out and Andy offered to take me in for a little while after seeing me at the gym so I'd been staying here for a couple of days.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're just sooooooo nice to let me stay here, Andy,&quot; I said, feeling his biceps. Rock hard! He flexed them underneath me and I swear I came a little in my underwear (I was only wearing some skinny tight underwear, totally cute. Okay, maybe I was trying to seduce him a little.)<br />
<br />
Andy looked at me with hunger in his eyes. He pulled me into his room and sat me on his bed, looking concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just worried about you bud.&quot; He put his arm around my shoulder. Electric. He was staring at me soooo hard I could feel his amazing green eyes boring into my soul, they were like magic or something, they had this weird magic effect on me, like I'd do anything for him, be anything for him. I'd only started going to that gym because of him. felt a weird fuzzy headache again and leaned into him to right myself.<br />
<br />
When it cleared I let my hand snake down his legs (sooooooooo big, omg his quads!) not that my body wasn't, like, bad itself, we'd like been working out together buddies at the gym, you know? He was showing me the tricks and I was developing a pretty tight little body with big arms for my height and man, the tightest eight pack you've ever seen. Of course my cock was fucking amazing, but now I'm just being cocky, really, it's all about my ass, my hot, cute, tight little ass... and I wanted him to pop it at last.<br />
<br />
I looked into Andy's eyes. The dizzy spells were passing. He was looking at me like a piece of meat, like he was never so hungry in his life. I got on my knees and pressed him down on the bed, overwhelming him with my sexuality. I spoke in a cute husky voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I worshipped his body then with my hands, with my tongue, with everything inside of me. Andy moaned, precumming a little. I slicked some on my hand and put it in my mouth. Andy was sooooooo hot, soooo hot and his muscle, omg, wow, so hard, biceps, triceps, his cute long blond hair, I loved his pecs, his pecs I could just chew on them all day, I just wanted him to pick me up and carry me around and suddenly he did, he picked me up and slammed me against the wall and pressed himself against me his hot cock waiting at my willing hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want this?&quot; He growled in my ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOooh yeah&quot; I squealed.<br />
<br />
He spit on his huge hands and lubed up his dick and then eased himself into me, gently at first, and then harder, and it hurt but it felt soooooooooo good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeaaah tight little gay boy, take it, take my hot cock with your tight ass with your cute little muscles and your soooo cute face, you are so cute, I'm gonna fuck the living shit out of you and then I'm gonna do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
And at the same time I was screaming now, pumping back and forth on his epic dick. &quot;Yeaaah fuck me baby, fuck me sooo hard, dominate me with your huge muscles, I am just a toy for you to dominate! Fuck me fuck me fuck me like the slut I am slut! AAAAAAAA!&quot;<br />
<br />
We both came like an explosion, a fountain, and then he turned me around and slammed me against the wall and did it again and it was even better the second time if you can believe it. After five times (I came six) he tossed me on the bed like a rag doll and just stared down at me for a moment. I felt so dizzy after a moment of his staring. When it passed he was standing over me, looking concerned.<br />
<br />
I got up and walked over to him. As I approached the mirror I saw myself. I was a sex God. I was the epitome of sex. Of course I was. I was born on this earth to be worshipped as a sex God. When Andy saw me a look of supreme love came into his face and he fell to his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;I--I... I love you, Peter.&quot;<br />
<br />
I caressed his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
My cock was even longer than his was, even though I was shorter and less muscular. I thrust it into his mouth without asking and he took it hungrily, blowing it like the pro he was, sucking and fondling and panting with pleasure. I came in his mouth eight times. Finally I was exhausted. I fell on the bed.<br />
<br />
He climbed in next to me and just stared at me for a long time as if he couldn't get enough and who could? I was like the cutest fucking thing ever. A sex god like I said. Suddenly I got one of those fucking dizzy spells again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, go play with yourself in the mirror or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
He lept up immediately to obey and I lay back, trying to recover from the spell. This one took a while. After like, five minutes, I finally opened my eyes. I WAS SO FUCKING HORNY! OH MY GOD! SOOOOOOOO HORNY!<br />
<br />
Wanted to fuck... wanted to fuck... wanted someone to hold my tight body and tell me how pretty I was and fuck me fuck me fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey fucker, get the fuck over here!&quot; I practically yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck no. You get the fuck over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was when I saw him. The real Sex God. He was 6'8&quot; and supremely fit, so built, so tight, so... oh my god, sigh... I came. I came everywhere. I loved him. I loved him more than anything, more than anyone, I would give my life for him. I crawled to him on my knees and he looked down upon me condescendingly but kindly. I worshipped merely his treetrunks for legs, knowing it was not enough, would never be enough.<br />
<br />
Finally I had it in my mouth. That dick. I never thought I would be able to take all of it in my mouth, but somehow i did, and I sucked him for so long, it was so fine, so good, i was so hot, he's so hot, i love him i worship him.<br />
<br />
I looked into his eyes. His eyes! His beautiful eyes. &quot;I'm yours. Please fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smirked and flexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gladly.&quot;</p>
