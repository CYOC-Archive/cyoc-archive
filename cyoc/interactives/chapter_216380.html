<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Entering the Moreland home, Connor immediately noticed his parents sitting in the kitchen. Chase and Charlotte were now both old enough to start solid food, the two teens noticing Jacob now wiping their faces as he fed them some baby food. Jacob now grinned, offering a polite smile as Arion entered. &quot;Good to see you Arion,&quot; he said. &quot;Been expecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its been too long Arion,&quot; Nina added happily, hugging the human sized fairy. &quot;Nova clued us in before you showed up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Clued you into what,&quot; Connor asked. Arion sighed, smoothing back his short silver hair as he turned to Connor and Spark. &quot;Kane,&quot; he said. &quot;He attacked a friend of Midna&#39;s recently.&quot; Connor paled slightly as Spark gulped, slowly approaching her father. &quot;How bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Arion said nothing, his massive shoulders slumping. Spark immediately picked up on the que, Midnas friend had obviously not survived. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she muttered. Taking a breath she now beckoned her father to the table. Arion and the teens now taking a seat as Nina picked up the twins. &quot;I better get these two cleaned up,&quot; she said. &quot;Jacob tell me everything later.&quot; Jacob nodded, the husband and wife exchanging a quick pec as Arion now explained what happened.<br />
<br />
Spark wasn&#39;t the only fairy that worked with humans. In this case Midnas friend, Sandriel , worked with a shaman near a Native American reservation. According to Arion, her family had become concerned when they hadn&#39;t heard from her in a few weeks. &quot;I investigated myself,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately from what I could tell Sandriel and her shaman were murdered perhaps a week ago. Judging by the method of killing we believed it to be a hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which led you to Kane,&quot; Spark finished. Arion now blushed, rubbing his neck sheepishly before answering. &quot;Actually we originally thought it was the Morelands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Connor and Spark exclaimed. The two teens looked close to exploding, in anger before Jacob raised his hand. &quot;Easy you two,&quot; he ordered. &quot;It makes sense. We&#39;re in the area and to the fae&#39;s knowledge I&#39;m the only hunter around here.&quot; Jacob now turned to Arion, carefully studying the fairy. &quot;So Arion what eliminated me and my family as suspects?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aside from reputation,&quot; Arion stated. &quot;It was your auras.&quot; The fairy now leaned closer, lowering his voice as he spoke. &quot;We don&#39;t like to bring this up but, hunters have an aura around them that&#39;s as distinctive as any human fingerprint. It helps fairies identify a hunter, in a worse case scenario. We have the Morelands family aura on record and this one didn&#39;t match. It did match a hunter though, one we thought long dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kane,&quot;<br />
<br />
Arion nodded, Connor now turning to Spark. &quot;Did you know about this aura thing?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Spark answered before frowning and turning to her father. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me about that daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its on a need to know basis and you didn&#39;t need to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark grumbled in response, folding her arms across her chest as she glared at her father. Clearing his throat, Arion now continued. &quot;Regardless once we learned the perpetrators identity. I realized you were all in danger. That&#39;s why I brought this.&quot; Spark and Connor watched as Arion reached into his coat pocket. Carefully the fairy now laid a small article upon the table. Spark and Connor confused by what appeared to be a fairy sized shirt. &quot;Um it&#39;s a bit small daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arion smirked, waving his hand over the object. Instantaneously, the small object now became human sized. Connor gazing at the fine material in wonder. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hydra mail,&quot; Jacob stated in awe as he tentatively reached out his hand. &quot;Very good Jacob,&quot; Arion smiled. &quot;I take it you are familiar with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly am,&quot; he replied. &quot;Its not as strong as dragon scale but it&#39;s better than anything humans got. Plus, it&#39;s self repairing, any damage done to it repairs itself almost instantly. Light weight, flexible, and able to absorb kinetic energy, it&#39;s the preferred light armor of several supernatural armies.&quot; <br />
<br />
Connor now gawked, reaching out a hand to touch the armor. The teen noting the small scales along the steel blue chest piece. &quot;Wow it feels so smooth,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Almost like snake skin.&quot; Arion simply nodded, a prideful smile on his face as he gazed at his custom armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um I hate to rain on your parade dad,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;But Kane was able to take out an actual dragon. How will this protect Connor when he has bullets that can pierce dragon hide?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anti dragon rounds are very rare and very expensive,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Most likely he knew what he was up against before he attacked the Davis family. He maybe crazy but he won&#39;t carry that kinda firepower into a fight. Besides, Samantha Davis osnt a full blood dragon, her scales probably aren&#39;t as strong&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the unlikely event he does I&#39;ve made certain modifications to my armor over the years.  Trust me he will be well protected,&quot; Arion smirked. &quot;Now, Connor would you like to try it on?&quot; Connor nodded, slowly picking up the armor before slipping it over his head. As he slipped his arms through, he was amazed at how light it felt. &quot;I feel like I&#39;m wearing a t-shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I like about it,&quot; Arion grinned. &quot;It carries almost no weight so it doesn&#39;t restrict the wearer. But, it has another secret I designed myself,&quot; Connor raised an eyebrow, wondering what else the armor had before gasping in shock. <br />
<br />
Slowly, Connor could see the armor extending down his arms and legs, completely encasing his limbs in the steel blue material. As that was occurring he felt a strange tickling sensation along his neck, quickly grabbing a mirror, he gasped as the armor now extended up his neck, slowly swallowing his head. Shocked, he tried to scream only for the material to cover his mouth before extending over his eyes. For a moment, Connor thought he would be smothered by the armor, only for his vision to clear.<br />
<br />
Spark had watched the process in fascination, her boyfriends body slowly consumed by the living armor. Gazing at his head, she watched as the armor formed into a helmet with darkened visor for his eyes. &quot;Connor,&quot; she asked as the armor finished transforming. &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; he said, gazing at his hands as he tentatively flexed them. &quot;This is wild. It almost feels like I&#39;m not wearing anything! How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda like the Mandalorian,&quot; Spark answered as she rubbed her chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the way,&quot; Connor joked, causing Spark to groan in annoyance. &quot;Yeah don&#39;t do that anymore.&quot; Connor chuckled, turning towards Arion. &quot;Thank you I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider it a wedding gift,&quot; Arion smirked. &quot;And just so you know, the armor can take whatever form you wish. All you need to do is think about it.&quot; Connor nodded, turning towards his father as the helmet now retracted. &quot;What do you think dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think your brother is going to be jealous,&quot; Jacob smirked. Father and son now chuckled softly as Connor turned towards Arion and Spark. Whatever Kane threw at them, he was ready for it.</p>
