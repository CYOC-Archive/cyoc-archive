<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What do you think&#39;ll happen, Ty?&quot; Dustin asked as the two stood outside the bathroom where the Father and Son were experiencing their change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well by now, their privates have probably switched ages.&quot; Ty said<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean, y&#39;know, that the boy will get a low voice and all hairy and the dad will turn into a big baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily, I mean, I just had their cock and balls switch sizes and maturity. But I could add some extra tricks in there if I wanted&quot; Ty began to grin. Dustin smiled back<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems ashame to give that little kid so much extra equipment without some of the other perks of adulthood...&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Back in the Bathroom, Dave was entranced watching his son Elliot&#39;s giant cock buck, leaking pre-cum onto the floor. He could feel a familiar stir in his groin, but his now tiny penis did not respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! Daddy! My penis is so big! It feels really good!&quot; The 9 inch erection looked obscene on the small boy&#39;s tiny frame, the throbbing cock a deep dark color compared to his son&#39;s smooth young skin. Dave shuffled uncomfortably, and his tiny dick slipped through his fly and disappeared into the dark hair of his crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Elliot... I think you should put that away now. We should go and try to figure out what&#39;s... what&#39;s....&quot; He couldn&#39;t finish as he stared at Elliot, who had wrapped one small hand around his thick shaft, his fingers unable to close around its girth. With his other hand he gently peeled back his newly formed foreskin, his young voice squeeking at the sensation. Dave felt so confused. He couldn&#39;t understand what he was seeing, but he was riveted to the spot. All of the sudden his mind became cloudy, and he stared at his sons endowment as if he had never seen a cock before--not like this! Not a man&#39;s huge hard dick! Another part of him remembered his own substantial former equipment and he felt aroused with the empathetic response of watching a man (boy? who could say anymore) pleasuring himself. He wanted to tell Elliot again to put his meat away and they would leave but all that came out was <br />
<br />
&quot;S--someone might walk in? You should put your...&quot; he gulped &quot;Penis away.&quot; Elliot gave another moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, why are you so nervous?&quot; the boy smirked and shimmied his shorts up his legs, He lifted the band of his cartoon underpants over his heavy balls and tried to stuff his dick in the briefs, but he grunted at the strain on his cock. &quot;It won&#39;t fit anymore, Daddy!&quot; the boy threw his hands in the air, smiling with a little more awareness than his father thought he should have. The boys brightly colored tank top was pulled up away from his pant-line, and his kiddish shorts were slung around his waist, the fly splayed open around the mammoth dick. &quot;Hey, where&#39;d your penis go, Daddy? Did it disappear?&quot;<br />
<br />
All of the sudden Dave felt a tingling in his privates again, and thinking he had to pee again he ran over to the urinal. He tried to fish his penis out his fly but it wasn&#39;t long enough to escape the fabric. Wildly he unbuttoned his pants and shoved them all the way to his ankles with his boxers and pushed his pelvis out to reach the urinal. Then he noticed where the tingling was coming from. The dense dark hair around his shrunken dick was receding away, growing thinner, then lighter in color, before it became a soft fuzz, then disappeared all together. A knowing growl behind him told him exactly where the hair had gone.<br />
<br />
His son Elliot had been walking to the mirror when he doubled over again. Dave shuffled awkwardly over to him, pants still around his ankles, transfixed as dark hair began to appear around his sons adult cock. It started as just a shadow, the skin on Elliot&#39;s balls and pubis dimpling, darkening a shade, then wiry hairs began to form. In a moment, Elliot had a thick bush which in no way diminished how big his cock looked to his taller father. A trail of black hair snaked up past his belly button, and as he placed his arms behind his head, eyes squeezed shut as he grunted and thrust his engorged cock forward, Dave saw thick hair appear in his armpits. His son gasped an locked eyes with his father, a knowing glint there.<br />
<br />
They were quite the scene in the bathroom. The father, almost 6 feet tall, stood on wobbly legs, pants around his ankles, all traces of body hair belted away from his bare legs. His crotch, babysoft, totally denuded and displaying a tiny flacid boy penis. A few feet away, standing with a confident stance, stood his &#39;little&#39; boy, shorts pulled up around his waist with only his monumentally large cock exposed. The dark coarse hairs on his bare calves and abdomen, a light shadow across his jaw.<br />
<br />
Again it felt like the first time Dave had ever noticed adult sexual features. The hair on his son&#39;s flat stomach seemed foreign to him, like something he might get to experience someday but hadn&#39;t yet. His sons coarse facial shadow made him look older, even though it sat on his still youthful face.He felt nervous and ashamed standing so naked in front of a developed specimen of manhood, but he felt too shy even to cover himself. He shook his head and tried to regain control.<br />
<br />
&quot;E--Elliot... if you don&#39;t put your... your pants on right now... I&#39;m gonna--going to--to...&quot; He trailed off. Elliot had walked right up to him and grabbed his tiny balls. His son still only came about as high as his rib cage, but the boy seized his balls with authority.<br />
<br />
&quot;They feel so tiny in my hands, Daddy! And so smooth!&quot; He grasped Dave&#39;s penis &quot;You&#39;re soooooo tiny Dad! I can&#39;t even wrap both my hands around my dick, but your penis an your balls fit in one hand!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sensations Elliot&#39;s ministrations were causing were electrical and pleasurable, but still the little penis did not respond or stiffen at all. Elliot&#39;s needy cock bucked again dripping a little pre-cum on the floor, and Elliot gave a quick tug. His hands rubbed up under Dave&#39;s shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember you used to have a hairy belly, Dad! Where did it all go? You feel so smooth!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave felt humiliated, being inspected like this by his son. At the same time, it felt embarrassing that his little boy was now so much more masculine than him in every way, and was fascinated by his father&#39;s immature features. For the life of him he couldn&#39;t move, his head was so clouded and confused. A part of him was enjoying the treatment of his son&#39;s ministrations, and partly he felt like this was Elliot&#39;s privilege as the more dominant male. His eyes steamy, he looked down at his son&#39;s hands. Before his eyes the small hands seemed to tense, the fat in them melting away and the fingers taking on a defined appearance. Though still childish in size, they were a man&#39;s hands now, and they were strong. The pressure on his small sack increased exponentially as the Elliot took a firm grip of his boyhood. The tendons and veins in his son&#39;s hands were now starkly visible as they fondled his equipment, the rougher skin against his hairless belly sent a shiver up Dave&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like that, Daddy?&quot; Elliot said, a sarcastic edge to the title. He looked up at the cooing older man, now in all appearances a shy boy for all his height.<br />
<br />
&quot;D--daddy?&quot; Dave stuttered. It felt foreign to be called that. It was true of course, but he felt so helpless.Elliot rubbed his thigh a bit and Dave breathed a sigh as the manly hands slipped around to his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmm. Smooth as a baby on your butt too, aren&#39;t you? Turn around now, let me see.&quot;  Elliott grabbed his hips on either side and firmly spun him around. Dave felt his son&#39;s hands on his butt, which now really was as smooth as it had been when Dave had been a baby. &quot;Very smooth&quot; said Elliott, his childish voice now tempered with a tone of authority. &quot;Smooth and lilly white. It&#39;s unfortunate that I&#39;m going to have to spank this soft little behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha--?&quot; Dave felt his shoulders droop.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been bad, Dad. A bad boy. You spanked me yesterday, even though I didn&#39;t do anything wrong. That was bad. And you were threatening to spank me just a minute ago weren&#39;t you? So do you think you deserve a spanking for being so mean? For threatening me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s voice was caught in his throat. A part of him couldn&#39;t believe this was happening. He was six feet tall! A full-grown man with responsibility and authority! He had a son whom he disciplined! But another part of him felt like this was a natural thing, and as his head drooped to his chest he again saw his tiny hairless tackle between his muscular legs--now a bit less muscular. He had watched his son&#39;s body evolve right before his eyes, even while he had felt himself diminish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear you, do you deserve a spanking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Use your words.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I thought. Bend over that sink.&quot; said Elliott, giving his dad a few gentle perfunctory slaps on the ass. Dave, pants still around his ankles, waddled over to the sink and leaned over on the counter, his smooth bare bottom exposed to his son. He was set up looking directly into the mirror, and though his son&#39;s shoulders were just above the counter-line, the image of the little boy with the hairy, lithe body and giant leaking cock made him tremble. As his son raised his hand for the first bare slap, Dave was almost certain he saw the tendons and muscles in his son&#39;s arms tighten, the baby-fat melting away as his lats became visible, pushing out against his tank-top. The first slap came very hard, Dave yelped and hopped forward. But it was no use as he felt a firm hand grasp his thigh and pull his butt back down to spanking height.<br />
<br />
After four slaps Dave had tears welling in his eyes. His bottom was so very sensitive, and Elliott was slapping his ass so hard. His own face in the mirror was a mask of confusion, his eyebrows knit in consternation over his circumstance: bent over receiving just punishment from... his son? His Daddy? Whatever the label, the situation was fair... was normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re lucky, Davey. A bad boy like you. I should take you over my knee and give you a proper spanking.&quot; Said Elliott initiating another round of swats on the exposed behind. <br />
<br />
Dave could only imagine that, his big body, naked, draped over his... Daddy&#39;s(?) much smaller frame, but still the young enforcer beneath him strong enough to bear the weight. Spanking him soundly over his knee. Making him stand in the corner. Sending him to bed early. He could picture it all like it had happened a dozen times. He began to cry real tears, his sobs rocking his big, but hairless frame.</p>
