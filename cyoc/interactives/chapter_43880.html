<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was brilliant at school and she had a brilliant career mapped out ahead of her. She could have been researching at Oxford but chose the pharmaceutical industry and quickly rose to the rank of research director. Despite her station, she still liked to muck about in the lab with new treatments and the &quot;liquid&quot; she presented to me that evening came after several weeks of evening work.<br />
<br />
Our relationship was on rocky ground. I regretted telling her of my fantasy, even more so just about forcing her to act it out.She hadn't worn a skirt since we nearly got beaten up in the city that night. I love to see women in long feminine flowey skirts and petticoats with tight tops and small waists and she looked so good. She dressed that way for me but it wasn't enough and I blew it. I also have a perversion of thinking of these beautiful women in their long skirts hiding a penis under their big skirts. I shared this with her and just about forced her to live it out by  weaing a dildo under her skirt and second going for a walk late at night with the dildo on under her skirt and no underwear so it made a noticible tent at the front. It loooked great for so long. I love dthe way she was frightened of being caught. When we did get caught by the gang who took us for a couple of gays, we were lucky to run for it.<br />
<br />
That killed the fantasy. She never wore a skirt since and spent long evenings at work. I reverted to my cross dressing that I had kept secret all my life. True, after 6 months of marriage and nearly getting caught in her skirts, I gave up and had not worn her clothes or ant womens clothes for 7 years since but now I was alone, I fell back into the old habit that dulled the pain of my lonely youth.<br />
<br />
I didn't know how to take it in. The &quot;liquid&quot; she presented me with with such enthusiasm that night was the culmination of her evenings at work. She said it would sort out my problem. It would fully transform me into a woman in 12 hours and then, she had another that would transform me back. It had worked on her lab assisstant. She said that I could play the part of a woman in the flowey skirts and fully get away with it. I wasn't sure but this was a way back into a marriage I had thought broken. I drank the liquid. It was bitter but not unpleasent. For the first time in 6 weeks, we wen't to bed together.<br />
<br />
The dreams I had that night were so strange but I slept solidly. I woke at 11.30 in the morning and I felt exhausted; my wife had gone to work. I got up to go to the bathroom and as I passed the mirror I saw a strange and beautiful woman in my PJ's. Then I realised why I was so tired and the night before came back to me. My god, it worked I thought. I carried on to the bathroom as I was bursting for a pee and without thinking, pulled my willy out of my PJ's and relieved my urge. Then it stuck me, I still had a penis. She didn't tell me anything about that.<br />
<br />
Back in the bedroom, I found a note from my wife. My clothes were in the spare room. She'd be home at 6.00pm and a PS: &quot;Don't wear anything other than the clothes laid out. BE a good boy and I'll give to the antidote&quot;. This was amazing, I rushed to the spare room and saw hung up a tight little sleeveles blouse, a big pink long flowey cotton skirt, a couple of white cotten frilly petticoats that were longer still than the skirt, a wide belt and a pair of sandals. Under the blouse was a bra with a note saying it was probably the wrong size but would have to do. I hesitated and wondered what she was trying to achieve but soon, my excitement at dressing as a woman and getting away with it was so strong, I got dressed. As I put the belt on, I looked about for a pair of knickers. Their weren't any. perhaps she meant me to wear my own so I walked to the bedroom and looked in my underwear draw. All I found was a note. It said &quot;Sorry, no underwear, you are to go commando whilst you are a woman. Don't cheat, I'll find out and you wan't to be a man again some day I'm sure!&quot;. So this was it, I was now at her mercy and she intended to put me through my fantasy and give me a taste of my own medicine. Thre was another sentance which said&quot; PS - No playing with yourself. Again, I'll know if you do&quot;. Almost immediately, my penis stirred on reading this and stared to grow. I watch the tent in my skirt growing in the mirror to spoil the image of an otherwise beautiful woman. Even so, the image captured the perversions of my fantasy and turned me on further. I ended up with the hardest erection I have ever had - and I couldn't deal with it. Now I understood the pain she had in mind to put me under. What did she have in mind? How far would she take this.</p>
