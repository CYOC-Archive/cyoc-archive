<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sumire Yamamoto smiled as she was lead to the Age Wing of the resort by the bellhop. She had doubts when the principal of Jefferson High School selected her to take part in Senior School trip. She is a thirty year old second generation Japanese American with short black hair. She was the social studies and home economics teacher for the school; she thought she wasn’t so special. <br />
<br />
However, she changed her mind quickly when she saw who she be rooming with. Both of them are male students of 18 years old, and both were Sumire’s favorites or at least one is her favorite while the other one is a close second. Daniel is one of Sumire’s favorite student; inquisitive, polite, and nice to everyone. He even had good manners to boot which definitely earn a bit of a crush from Sumire. Even then he good looking at the boot, however Sumire knew she couldn’t pursue a form of romantic relationship with him when breaking serious ethics and moral rules between a student & teacher. Hopefully this room in this particular wing that she signed up for could close the difference.<br />
<br />
The second student that is rooming with her on the other hand is a bit of an oddball. Henry was also good student that always pay attention, always did his work on time, and always in the best results. The only problem is he cleans to Daniel as if he was codependent on him and it was a bit one-sided. Daniel didn’t seen the mind this behavior and that confused Sumire, so she asked him about it one day. What she learned shocked her so much she felt sorry for him.<br />
<br />
Henry a bit of a neglected child. His parents ignored him and gave all the attention to his younger sibling. They always gave him low quality school supply and always hand me downs from his cousins. Plus Daniel always had this big brother vibe so it was only natural for Henry to form an attachment to Daniel like siblings despite being the same age and only months apart. Maybe this room they’re going to could fix a few things.<br />
<br />
Soon they were led into the room by the bellhop and just before they do anything the bellhop turn to address them.<br />
<br />
“Now a few things to go over.” The Bellhop start say. “As you already know by the leaning teacher or any form of instructions that was given, this resort can transform their guests into anything and anyone they want. The Age Wing can age or regress the guest into whatever age they want. But of course there are a couple of ways to do that. The room your in is one of them. It can help you change your age just by thinking about it. All you have to do is to picture the age you want to be and the room will do it for you. Like so.” <br />
<br />
As soon as the bell hop said that, something happened to the bellhop. He seemed to beginning younger and his uniform seems to shrink with him however, it seems his pants was morphing to something. By the time he was done he look really young almost as a kid dressing up and to their surprise his pants look like a training pants. He look up to them and continue talking. <br />
<br />
“If you don’t want to change your age in your room, there are other things in the wing that can suit you better.” He said although it was hard to take him seriously when he is just a child and he had a child’s voice.  “For example: some of our restaurants have a special ingredient on their food for appropriate ages, eat them and you will regress to that age. The rest of our restaurants have certain areas that you can pick to enjoy your meals that will age you or regress you depending how long you stay in there. Just be careful with certain restaurants and I will emphasize on why later.” This caught Sumire’s attention. <br />
<br />
“Our shopping center has different ways in changing your age. We got a pool and a spa for just regression, like a Fountain of Youth. And lastly we have some entertainment to help accommodate your age changes. Including an interesting show run by a woman name Leslie although I’ve been order to say that while the show was enjoyable. I would not recommend it to you and don’t worry the rest of the teachers and students you have happened told the same thing.” This cause Sumire some concern fearing certain students will ignore this warning.<br />
<br />
“Now to circle back to my earlier warning about some restaurants and just a bit of a warning before you start. Age does have a limit from zero (newborn age) to a hundred. If you go past a hundred, you will instantly die from old age. If you all ‘the tenants’ are below ten-years-old a babysitter or a substitute mother will be assigned to the room to take care of you. Don’t worry if you regressed past newborn, you would be instantly inside the woman we would assign you with or the nearest woman who is old enough to carry a child.” The Bellhop explained which cause Sumire to briefly to flash a smile. <br />
<br />
“But if  you regress past conception, you will not die, only become just an egg and will need to wait to be reconceived again. Although your appearance may change, but thanks to our records in the lobby. We can easily restore you to your proper look. And for the clothing and other necessities in your luggage, don’t worry. When you change your age, your clothes will change to match that age. Like mine did.” The bellhop finished proudly. Daniel raise his hand..<br />
<br />
“Question how old are you right now?” Ask Daniel out of curiosity.<br />
<br />
“I’m four years old. it’s the youngest we bellhops can get and we have to grow ourselves pack up before we return to work. Sadly, we can’t make ourselves younger unless we are about to go on vacation, which sadly I’m not on right now.” Answered the bellhop.<br />
<br />
“Dude why are you wearing training pants then if you’re only four? Shouldn’t you be potty trained by now?” Asked Henry. The bellhop smiled as if he was looking forward to answering this question.<br />
<br />
“One: staff that regressed to this age has their pants turn into training pants. Two: you can technically choose to have your pants become training pants. For a staff, it’s for comfort some of the times, but mostly for this .” The bellhop said before the indicator of his training pants turned color signaling that he wet himself. Henry blush at this which Sumire notice but she also noted that the blush was a good kind of blush. something she can exploit later.<br />
<br />
“Was holding that in for an hour and my break is not for another hour. Us bellhops usually take a vantage of this by using the rooms to make us younger so we can use the bathroom. Now; if you please excuse me, I need to go change myself before I have to age myself back up to return to my other duties.” And that the Bellhop left Sumire holding the door open and closed it behind him. She turned to look at her two students.<br />
<br />
“So you two, shall we begin?” Sumire asked.<br />
<br />
“How?” Ask Daniel.<br />
<br />
“I kind of want to re-explore my high school senior days.” Sumire said. This meet with a bit of an argument breaking out. Eventually, it was resolved.</p>
