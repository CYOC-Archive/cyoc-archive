<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom was standing in front of a mirror in Alice’s bedroom. Despite the curtains drawn and the room dark; Tom was able to see quite clearly as if it was day. His newly acquired enhanced were-vision allowing him to see the new were-fox he has become. The fur covering him from ear to paw; with a white underbelly and black for his paws, the rest in orange-red fur. Tom got a good look at his new vulpine muzzle, opening his mouth to see his new teeth; sharp enough to rip flesh from bone. The black nose at the end, allowing him to take in the new smells that he would never have pickup on before; smelling Alice as she gets behind him. Tom rumbles happily as he watches Alice run her paws up and down his new body.<br />
<br />
“I know exactly what you are feeling,” Alice cooing; “your first transformation, the first time you see the new you; it’s an electrifying experience.”<br />
“It’s all so new,” Tom speaking in new slightly gruff voice; “it’s like…”<br />
“Being reborn,” Alice finishing; “later in the evening, I can show you a quiet wooded area were we can be furry under the starry night sky.”<br />
“You go outside in your fur form,” Tom turning around to look at Alice; “doesn’t that risk exposing your secret to the world?”<br />
“Not if your careful,” Alice smiling; “and its fursona. While Seattle is not Moon Lake; we were’s in the big city do have a few spots we can go to be ourselves.”<br />
“Moon Lake,” Tom slanting his new vulpine head to the side; “were have I heard that before?”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Back in Moon Lake and at the Twist residence, Marci was taking in the new form her husband was in; a large eight foot were-tiger. A were-tiger whose fursona is based off of a Bengal tiger; seeing Ted in white fur with black stripes, Marci purred as she placed her paws on Ted’s new body. Eager to explore his new physique, as Ted looked at his new paws; flexing his feline digits back and forth, watching the retractable claws pop in and out.<br />
“Perhaps,” Lila watching the two; “I should give you a moment as you two get better acquainted.”<br />
“Don’t leave,” Marci unable to keep her eyes off her husband; “I am bisexual and do want to have a little fun with you, if it’s all right with Ted.”<br />
“And spoil the moment as you two consummate your marriage with each other,” Lila getting off of the bed; “I think not. Have your moment with your husband,” Lila placing a paw on both Ted and Marci’s rump; “we can have some fun later.”<br />
<br />
As Lila left the room, Ted finally looked at Marci with his new eyes; observing her in a new light as her feline form gives off subtle clues as to her eagerness for him. No word were spoken as Marci guided Ted to the bed; her pheromones spoke volumes as Ted smelled his wife’s scent for the first time. Rumbling in approval as she got on all fours; flicking her tail to the side and letting Ted get a good look at her sopping wet sex.<br />
“Come now Ted,” Marci purring; “like you, I have been waiting a long time for this.”<br />
<br />
Ted roars as he jumps on the bed; his new agility one of the many pleasures he will enjoy as a new were-tiger. Blinded by lust and a whole host of new sensations; Ted plunges his new barbed cock into Marci and starts thrusting wildly.<br />
“OH GAWD,” Marci yowling; “THAT FEELS AMAZING TED!”<br />
<br />
Ted doesn’t answer; placing his paws on Marci’s shoulders as he continues to bury himself into Marci’s slick folds. Enjoying the moment as his furry balls slap up onto her crotch; continuing to grind into his wife. For Marci, this was a dream come true; wanting to bear Ted’s cubs after they got married, but afraid that turning him into a were-cat would make him bisexual or worse gay. Always dreaming of him being a strong feline with white fur; Marci was yowling in pure bliss as the barbs on Ted’s penis gave her orgasm after orgasm.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“Alice,” Tad embracing the were-vixen before him; “how soon can we be married.”<br />
“Oh Tad,” Alice smiling as a tear sheds from her eye; “we are bonded with each other now. We are married in a sense.”<br />
“But not officially,” Tad doing his best to kiss Alice with his vulpine muzzle; “how soon can we make it official.”<br />
“I first have to call my parents up,” Alice sighing; Tad’s gentle touching making her eager for his rod in her again. “Let them know that you are…”<br />
“Hush,” Tad stopping Alice; “let’s enjoy this moment. We can always tell them tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“OH YES! OH YES! DO IT TED! BREEEEEED ME!”<br />
With Lila joining Frances and Samantha as they sat in the kitchen quietly listening to what was going on; each sipping a cup of tea from the pot that was made earlier. The sound of the bed creaking being drowned out by the sound of Marci’s joyful screaming and Ted’s grunting and growling.<br />
“PUT A CUB IN ME HUSBAND! ”<br />
<br />
“Did any of you see Marci take any were-birth control,” Lila looking at the Twists.<br />
“I didn’t see her take any,” Samantha shaking her head; “but from what Marci has told me, this is something she has been looking forward to for a really long time.”<br />
“Well she couldn’t have pick a better man,” Lila ear’s swiveling as the sounds of heavy and intense rutting could still be heard; “Ted’s fursona is something. Even I was surprised when I saw it.”<br />
“Not the typical tiger you and your brother are,” Samantha asking.<br />
“Oh he is all were-tiger,” Lila smiling; “black stripes on white fur, with piercing blue eyes. A good eight feet of pure masculinity that would make even the two of you,” Lila winking; “yearn for him.”<br />
“I think not,” Frances slightly hissing; “I have been with Samantha since my first transformation. I have no desire,” Frances looking at her life partner; “to stray from her.”<br />
“Not even for a little honey from an eager were-tigress,” Lila growling seductively.<br />
“That’s different,” Samantha placing a paw on Frances’s furry lap; “we have no problems sharing each other with other ladies, but not with men.”<br />
<br />
Back in the spare room; Marci was feeling ecstatic. Her husband finally a were-tiger; there chance to consummate their marriage achieved. Not caring that she didn’t take any birth control; Marci was certain this moment would be all that was needed to ensure she and Ted would soon be proud parents. She was certain as her body tensed up; gripping Ted’s shaft deep in her as it started to milk him. Her body shuddering as she felt him tense and twitch; spilling his seed in her as she yowls in pure ecstasy. Her scream muted by the large beastly roar coming from the were-tiger on top of her.<br />
<br />
The two collapsing on the bed, Marci panting and gasping as she revels in her orgasm; Ted still in her and letting his warm seed flow in her still as he experiences his first time as a proper were-tiger.<br />
“Is sex as a were always that intense,” Ted finally coming out of his haze; his paws wrapped tightly around Marci in a protective embrace; “because that felt… primal.”<br />
“It was wonderful,” Marci purring; “more than what I have fantasized.”<br />
“Looks like you can throw away those gloves you’ve always wore to bed,” Ted adjusting to better hug his wife.<br />
“That and your pajamas,” Marci giggling; “sleeping in your fursona is so much more enjoyable.”<br />
“Anything else I need to know,” Ted nuzzling his wife.<br />
“Well,” Marci smiling as she enjoys the afterglow from sex; “you may have knocked me up. We weres conceive far more easily than a regular person.”<br />
“What,” Ted letting go of his wife in complete surprise; “you mean this was your time of the month?”<br />
“No silly,” Marci giggling; “those barbs on you penis may have stimulated my ovaries to ovulate. Just like regular felines when in heat. If you want,” Marci purring; “we can have this talk as we walk back to the motel room. It is after dark,” Marci nuzzling her husband; “so being outside in your fursona is legal here in Moon Lake. It will also give you a chance to experience those new animal urges now in you,” Marci rolling over to be on top of Ted; smiling as she enjoys the new furry look that is her husband.</p>
