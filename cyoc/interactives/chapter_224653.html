<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy tried to ignore Jeff but listening to him sob was frustrating! On one hand it filled her with glee, she was getting her payback, and she had earned it! Jeff always called her twerp and bossed her around, he was always in charge and it always seemed like being ignored by him was the best case scenario.<br />
<br />
But hearing him sob hurt. She did love him, although couldn&#39;t put into words why... Jeff was mean, but not always. And most of the time he bossed her around it was because their parents would say the same and he would also get in trouble if he let her continue... but she wants to be mad at him, this is her payback!<br />
<br />
&#39;Jeff is the one that should feel torn! Jeff is the one that should feel lost between love, rage, and sadness!&#39; she concluded bitterly. That is when her next action came to her. Jeff set himself up with a tiny dick and lost access to the Chronivac, that explains his sadness. She put him in a diaper, explaining his rage. She just needs to give him something he would love in order to leave him teetering and confused.<br />
<br />
Lucy recalculated, It didn&#39;t initially make any sense that doing something nice would punish her brother more, but her math kept checking out... it would increase his confusion, and make him go in circles as he&#39;s trying to make any decision. &quot;Jeff, follow me to my room and stop making noise.&quot; she whispered inaudibly.<br />
<br />
Lucy reached her bedroom as Jeff was standing up from where he was left whimpering on his bed. He reached his door and quieted himself before realizing something was going on. Confused and scared he had crossed the hall and was opening his sister&#39;s door though every fiber of his being was telling him that engaging with her was taking his life in his own hands.<br />
<br />
Lucy looked up and smiled, Jeff being silenced left her doing all of the talking which was unusual and she felt a little flustered. &quot;So Jeff... I had a minute to think...&quot; She had less than that but her mind was racing.... &quot;As my big brother, protecting me is your job... and to do that you should be masculine and intimidating to would be bullies.&quot; She paused gauging her brothers reaction.<br />
<br />
Jeff flinched not knowing where this could possibly be headed. She did after all just remove his access to the Chronivac and put him into a diaper. Masculine and intimidating were way out of reach right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to be tall and have a deep voice, like a full grown man, and you shouldn&#39;t have any body fat, it should all be muscle.&quot; She paused looking Jeff over. &quot;You still wouldn&#39;t look too scary when I let you back into normal clothes... I know, I want you to grow a beard, err, be able to grow one, but keep it trimmed to stubble. That should make you look masculine enough to stop all the school bullies in their tracks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was confused by this, its not like he could make himself finish puberty or tell his body how to use the food he eats. He nodded because he would like those things too but shrugged his shoulders helplessly and turned to walk away. Maybe this will ensure he stays lean throughout his life. On the bright side, Lucy expects to let him go back to normal clothes eventually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and Jeff,&quot; Jeff turned back to see Lucy with a conniving grin. &quot;I was talking to your body, not you, and I want it now!&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyes went wide with alarm, he could feel his body responding to the commands. His bones hurt as they stretched and pulled at his skin, organs, nerves, and blood vessels. <br />
<br />
Jeff fell to the floor in silent agony, his skin was on fire as his body suddenly decided to wage war on his fat cells all throughout his body. His throat was pulsating as his vocal cords were thickening and stretching, and his face was sore as all his androgenic hairs were suddenly demanded to activate and burst through his pores, his entire face felt like a giant pimple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and no stretch marks, I can make him uglier later if I want to, but for now at least, I&#39;ll let him be handsome. Now Jeff, go take care of your newly improved body and learn how to trim your beard!&quot; Lucy giggled as Jeff slowly got to his feet. <br />
<br />
Jeff had grown 4 inches to an adult height of 6&#39;1 from his respectable former height of 5&#39;9. His face was covered in a weird mat of peach fuzz which still looked like it was wriggling out of his face as his hair was trying to instantly develop from inactive into normal beard hair. He looked at his body finding he looked like an underwear model. Cut or ripped were the words that came to mind from overheard conversations during gym class. He had never been an athlete but now his average physique had morphed into that of a lean beginning bodybuilder&#39;s as his fat stores were devoured to fuel unearned muscle development.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled a disposable bic razor from a drawer and the shaving gel he had barely used in the last 6 months. His body continued of its own accord, the scraggily growth began to thicken, undoubtedly performing months of development in minutes. Jeff watched fascinated as the writhing mass of hair stopped and his body applied the gel and began removing the hair. He nicked himself numerous times but pressed on paying no mind under his sister&#39;s compulsion... his skin and muscles felt like they were about to rip open with each movement but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Once he finished shaving, the hair again began crawling out, this time it was thick, dense, and dark. Within a few minutes several millimeters of hair had grown, approximating him maintaining a few days of growth and then he was free to move again. Jeff took care of his bleeding face and neck, astounded by how mature and rugged he now looked in sharp contrast to the diaper he was wearing. The diaper was set up to be normal through the Chronivac, everyone will notice and talk about his overnight maturation. As Lucy hoped, Jeff was conflicted.<br />
<br />
While that was happening Lucy was in her room reeling from the fact that her commands change reality, she does indeed rule.</p>
