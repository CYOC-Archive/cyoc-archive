<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I watched with interest to see what this rough manual laborer had to offer when suddenly he undid his belt and dropped his pants and underwear to the ground, revealing one of the thickest flaccid penises I’ve ever seen. My mouth dropped as Mr Jay snapped on some rubber gloves, brought out a tape measure and began measuring Theo’s penis across multiple dimensions.<br />
<br />
“While our judge takes those measurements, let me explain how this works for anyone who’s new. we have five categories; Length, Girth, Grower, Shower and Master. Each category comes with it’s own fabulous prize which will be awarded at the end of the show. Furthermore...”<br />
<br />
As Hoyt continued talking I leaned over and whispered to my brother. “What the hell, you said this was a talent competition.”<br />
<br />
“Oh I must’ve misunderstood...” Christoper whispered back, with a broad grin on his face “But this is perfect! Your cock is massive! You’ve probably got all these guys easily beat!”<br />
<br />
“But...but-” I couldn’t think of a good excuse that wouldn’t be suspicious. That was when I realized the host was still explaining the rules and if I was going to get out of this without being exposed I needed to pay attention<br />
<br />
“Of course it’s not all prize, For every inch rounded up between last and first place in the length and girth categories, and every five fluid ounces rounded up in the grower and shower categories, the loser gets a strike…” Hoyt paused. I was hoping he’d say three strikes and you’re off the stage but instead he reached behind his podium and brought out a large flat object with a handle, “...from this Paddle! So lets give a big hand to these brave lads for literally putting their ass on the line tonight! Of course it goes without saying you can’t collect any prizes awarded to you until you have paid any fines you’ve been dealt.”<br />
<br />
The crowd laughed and jeered.<br />
<br />
“Well Mr Jay how do you rate Theo’s talent?”<br />
<br />
“Impressive as always, Length 13.4 inches, Girth 12.5 inches,” As the old man read the numbers off his notebook I felt my penis stirring, “flaccid volume of 28.44 fl oz, increasing by 54.65 fl oz upon erection. Above average all around but very good thickness in particular going for him.”<br />
<br />
The audience applauded and Theo did a few muscle flex poses.<br />
<br />
“Okay onto contestant number two” Hoyt moved to the second person in line who introduced himself as Grant, a passenger and a gardener. He then dropped his underwear and pants to the ground and revealing a penis that was a lot smaller than the first contestant’s which was only met with polite applause. After Mr Jay finished taking the flaccid measurements, Grant began to lightly pull on his penis, making it grow even longer than Theo’s. The crowd went wild.<br />
<br />
“Length 14.21 inches, Girth 11.63 inches,” the old man announced once he had finished his calculations, “flaccid volume of 15.15 fl oz, increasing by 61.13 fl oz upon erection. I was skeptical at first but he’s definitely a grower!”<br />
<br />
The next to contestants were introduced and measured in a similar manner. Number three was Shaun an ex football player who’s giant cock was very impressive when he brought it out but didn’t get much bigger when he was hard. Number four was Lenny, a cook onboard the ship, who’s penis was the longest I had ever seen. Then came my brother’s turn.<br />
<br />
“Hi I’m Christopher Campbell, and as thanks to my brother Daniel here for bringing me on this trip, I’d want any prizes I win to be awarded to him instead.”<br />
<br />
“Wow such a strong bond between these two, fine gentlemen” Hoyt turned to the judge, “Well then let it be officially noted on the record that should contestant five take first place in any category, the prize shall instead be awarded to contestant six!”<br />
<br />
The judge nodded and scribbled something down in his notebook.<br />
<br />
“Well I think that’s enough small talk, time to cast off your clothes and show us your talent!”<br />
<br />
Christopher smiled and pulled his pants down without any hesitation. Cheers came up instantly from the crowd. <br />
<br />
Even though I had seen it multiple times growing up and earlier today in the cabin I couldn’t help but look and admire his size. It didn’t look like it would beat the other contestants but my brother still looked optimistic.<br />
<br />
“And last but not least contestant number six” Hoyt turned to me and looked over my expensive suit “Someone’s looking fancy!”<br />
<br />
“Well it’s all about presentation.” I laughed nervously.<br />
<br />
“So do you think you have what it takes to win then Daniel?”<br />
<br />
“Uhhh...”<br />
<br />
“Ha If you think mine is big, wait till you see this guy” Christopher interrupted throwing an arm around my shoulder so any hope of running off was dashed. “I’m pretty sure he’s got one of the biggest cocks out there. It wasn’t apparent when we were growing up, because he was a bit of a late bloomer. In fact I almost thought he was wearing a falsie when we were kids. But then a few weeks after he landed his first job he really went through a growth spurt. And you should see who he’s married to. Someone’s gotta be laying at least twelve inches of pipe to keep that hottie satisfied.”<br />
<br />
“Well why don’t we see for ourselves” Hoyt turned to me “If it’s half as good as your brother says it is I’m sure we’ll all be very impressed. Why don’t you whip it out for us Daniel.” The crowd cheered me on. There was no way to get out of this now without arousing suspicion. Hopefully it could just hang my falsie out through my fly and no one would be able to tell it wasn’t real. I undid my pants and flopped out my gigantic phallus. The crowd burst into applause, everyone seemed to be buying it.<br />
<br />
“Oh very impressive.” The judge said as he was already putting his tape measure around my fake penis. Thank god he was wearing gloves or he might have felt it was synthetic. I was not wearing my true to touch model having opted for visual realism and extra size, knowing that there was a chance my brother would see it on this trip and I didn’t want to lose his respect, “Now we’re going to need it hard to measure for the length, girth and grower categories.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll try but I’m not really in the mood.” I laughed nervously as I awkwardly began to rub my floppy falsie. This one did not have erectile features so the effort was completely futile. “I guess I just don’t find sausage fests very arousing.”<br />
That was a lie. For whatever reason I could feel my micropenis twitching against the sides of the small opening it was nestled in.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s perfectly understandable.” Hoyt assured me, “But not to worry, you’re still in the running for the shower award that goes to the largest flaccid penis. So what’s the verdict?”<br />
<br />
“He’s just a little shy of the current lead,” The judge announced “But I wasn’t able to measure properly with the trousers in the way. If he were to remove them he may take first place”<br />
<br />
“Well what are you waiting for!” Hoyt exclaimed “Cast ‘em off! I’d say your a bit over dressed anyway!”<br />
<br />
“What- I” I tried to think of an excuse a reason to save face. I’d already taken my penis out, I could hardly declare modesty maybe if I just say I don’t want the prize I could-<br />
<br />
“Hurry up Daniel you’re holding up the competition.” without warning Christopher came up behind me and yanked my fancy trousers down to my ankles. I froze in place unable to figure out what to do as the judge pushed his tape measure up to my pubic region and...<br />
<br />
“Hold on a second.” the judge said as he felt the gap between the rubber and my skin. Before I could stop him, he reached out on either side of me and unbuckled my falsie fasteners (custom painted to blend in with my skin tone). Then he grabbed the silicone polymer shaft and pulled away the one thing protecting me from a lifetime of ridicule. A very clear shiny strand of precum trailed between my little one inch stiffie and the base of my falsie before dripping into the $300 trousers wrapped around my ankles.<br />
<br />
There was a pause. I felt my ability to live a normal life slipping away as the audience erupted into laughter.<br />
<br />
“Woah artificial enhancements are against the rules, get this out of here.” Hoyt took my falsie from the judges hands and threw it into the audience. I reached out to stop him but was too slow. “I guess this means contestant six is disqualified so-”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, he’ll still be allowed to compete,” the judge interrupted, “I just need to retake the measurements. Hold still.” I don’t know why but I felt compelled to obey. Maybe I was in shock. He laid his tape measure on my tiny penis pushing it against my pubic region, then wrapped it around my microshaft causing my oozing dicklet to slime over his gloves.<br />
<br />
“Erect size! 0.9 inches long, 1.3 inches thick!” he called out. The crowd burst into laughter and all I could do was stand there leaking precum. “Unable to obtain flaccid measurements at this moment.” <br />
<br />
“Well Daniel,” the host jeered, “I guess it’s not all about presentation after all!”</p>
