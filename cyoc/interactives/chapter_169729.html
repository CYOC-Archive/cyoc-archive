<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the grand course meal was indeed delicious and nice beds were indeed soft, it was more than a little hard to get settled in for the night. You&#39;d signed up for this competition on a whim (because who wouldn&#39;t be curious when offered a contract to sign by a plastic animal lady) and, to be honest, you were beginning. The contract was legally binding and all, but you hadn&#39;t expected to come to this event as a free person and potentially leave as a person&#39;s property! Well, it stated as such in the contract, but you hadn&#39;t taken the time to read through that thick stack of paper! You thought it would be like a game show or something!<br />
<br />
You sighed, settling back into your suitably comfy bed and looking up at your bedroom&#39;s ceiling. Whether you won or lost tomorrow would determine your fate, whether you liked it or not. Bummer, to put it lightly.<br />
<br />
Despite considering the ramifications of being someone else&#39;s property or owning someone else as your own, you manage to get a good night&#39;s sleep, though the way you woke up was a bit jarring. An alarm you never saw jolted you out of your slumber, the likes of which was followed shortly by Eostre&#39;s voice chiming, &quot;Rise and shine, contestants! The time for the competition to begin is approaching soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
You shot out of bed and took a quick shower, throwing on a fresh pair of clothes as fast as you could, then throwing open your suite&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, contestant!&quot; chirped the chipper voice of a plastic animal lady, &quot;Are you ready to leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WAUGH!&quot; you yelped, stumbling back and falling flat on your ass. &quot;W-what the-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my!&quot; the plastic animal lady gasped, a mouse lady based on her oversized ears, pointed snout, and pale gray coat of plastic, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fine,&quot; you stammered, climbing to your feet, &quot;Just startled.&quot; As you stood, you couldn&#39;t help but take in the plastic mouse lady&#39;s body. Just like all the other plastic animal ladies, excluding that fox from before, Hera, the mouse was entirely nude, though her body was bare of her more sexual features. The mouse&#39;s body was shaped like that of a model&#39;s, tall and slim, yet not lacking in the curves department, but you couldn&#39;t help but stare at her tail, the glossy appendage swaying stiffly in the air behind her shapely rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies, contestant,&quot; the plastic mouse lady apologized, bowing deep enough for you to see the back of her neck. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to startle you; I&#39;m here to take you to your starting place in the competition. Are you ready to leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced back at the room one last time, then sighed, &quot;As ready as I&#39;ll ever be. Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the plastic mouse lady led you off into the hotel, winding through corridors until finally found your way outside. Once there, the mouse took you by the hand, allowing you to admire the sleek, smooth texture of her body&#39;s plastic, and guided you to a car parked in the weird hotel&#39;s parking lot: a Jeep by the looks of it, the likes of which seemed fully equipped for off-roading. You paused for a moment at that. Wait. Off-roading?<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, miss, uh, mouse?&quot; you called, opening the Jeep&#39;s passenger side door up, &quot;Where exactly are you taking me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The mouse shot you a toothy smile, chirping, &quot;I&#39;m not at liberty to give you that information yet, contestant. Now get into the vehicle, if you don&#39;t mind. We do have a schedule to keep, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
You frowned a bit, but complied, climbing into the jeep and buckling up your seat belt. Without another word, the plastic mouse lady started the Jeep and pulled out of the parking lot, taking the bulky car out onto a dirt road that seemed to lead deeper into the island.<br />
<br />
For the first few minutes of the drive, you and the plastic mouse lady sit in silence, the mouse lady&#39;s eyes focused on the road while you took a look at the scenery passing by. The pale sands of the island&#39;s beach quickly gave way to darker earth, tall tropical trees springing up here and there as you moved further into the island. Before long, the biome you were traveling in became obvious: it was a tropical jungle.<br />
<br />
By the time you made this realization, however, the silence within the Jeep was practically deafening. You had to say something, if only to break the silence! &quot;So, Miss mouse,&quot; you said as casually as you could, allowing your eyes to wander over the plastic mouse lady&#39;s lovely form, &quot;Do you have a name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is currently Mimi,&quot; the plastic mouse lady stated, keeping her eyes on the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;Currently?&quot; you echoed, arching up an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Mimi chirped brightly, still not bothering to turn your way. &quot;I used to have a different name, but it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. My name is what my Owner calls me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your frown deepened slightly at that. &quot;Does that mean you used to be, you know, human?&quot; you questioned cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; Mimi responded, guiding the Jeep into a bend in the road with a smooth turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you remember being human?&quot; you prompted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm!&quot; the plastic mouse lady agreed.<br />
<br />
You knew it was probably wrong to pry into the plastic mouse lady&#39;s past, but your curiosity got the better of you. &quot;Do you... do you miss it?&quot; you inquired, your voice gentle and subdued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, silly!&quot; Mimi giggled, finally turning to give you a pearly smile as the Jeep rumbled to a stop. &quot;I&#39;m a doll, remember? I exist to be owned, not to ponder the meaning of my existence! Now, contestant, please step out of the vehicle. We&#39;ve arrived at our destination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the Jeep, you found yourself in the middle of a clearing, the sound of rushing water and the distant cries of exotic birds coloring your surroundings with the sounds of the jungle. The lightly humid air caused your clothing to stick to your skin as your stared at your surroundings, your mouth agape in surprise. You knew that the island had a jungle on it, but no one told you that the competition would be taking place in the jungle itself!<br />
<br />
Mimi tapped you on your shoulder at the point of your realization, pushing a heavy canvas backpack into your arms and chirping, &quot;These are your supplies for the first day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, wha-!&quot; you blurted, only to be interrupted by Mimi shoving another bundle into your arms, explaining, &quot;This is your tent, fully equipped with a sleeping bag, a waterproof coating on its outer layer, and a screen to keep the bugs out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on-!&quot; you sputtered, fumbling with the packs. Mimi seemed not to hear you, simply placing another item on top of your stack and saying, &quot;And that is your zapper, your only weapon in this competition. It&#39;s indestructible, but take good care of it, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
After struggling for a few more moments, you managed to get yourself situated, attaching your tent bundle to your backpack, then placing the zapper, a long-barreled plastic pistol by the looks of it, in the handy little holster hanging from the backpack&#39;s straps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I go, however,&quot; Mimi chirped sweetly, &quot;Allow me to go over the rules one last time. First of all, no violence is allowed and will be severely punished. Second of all, we take our promises seriously in this competition: if you break any, we&#39;ll make sure you won&#39;t be able to regret it, if you catch my drift. Finally, in every quadrant of the forest, there is a resupply zone, where you can restock your supplies without fear of being eliminated. No use of zappers is allowed within the resupply zone, but due to the fact that this is still a competition, you are not allowed to stay within the resupply zone for more than 30 minutes. Failure to comply to these rules will result in immediate disqualification. Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment, going over the rules in your head, before slowly nodding. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty, then!&quot; Mimi chirped, sauntering back over to the Jeep and unwittingly giving you a good look at her rather shapely rear, the likes of which glistened with droplets of water condensed from the humid air. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you to it! The games begin in less five minutes, so be prepared!&quot; With that, the plastic mouse lady, hopped back into the Jeep and drove off, leaving you alone in the clearing.<br />
<br />
Checking your supplies, you found you had plenty of snack foods and several canteens filled with water, a detailed map, a compass, a large tent clearly meant for more than one person, a comfy bedroll, and some bug repellent. It wasn&#39;t what you&#39;d expected to have to work with, but it would do.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you heard the clear sound of a horn, a long, blaring note that obviously indicated the start of the competition. Your hand slid down to your zapper&#39;s holster as you licked your lips.<br />
<br />
Let the games begin indeed...</p>
