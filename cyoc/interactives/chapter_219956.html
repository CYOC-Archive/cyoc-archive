<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The soldiers were still there, occasionally trying to get my attention and ask questions, but I was past caring about them. What they&#39;d told me about the Breastinator...<br />
<br />
I was still fuming - someone had done this to me. Someone had DONE this to me on purpose! My entire life - my home - my neighborhood - my entire CITY at this fucking rate - was gone. All because some dumb shit out there in the universe had invented something called the &#39;Breastinator.&#39; <br />
<br />
Who could it have been? Was it someone I knew?? Who the fuck would DO this to me? Who the fuck would WANT to do this to anyone?! There was no way one of my friends would do this. Absolutely no way my Mom would have - how much time and money had she spent trying to get me help while my boobs kept growing? Fucking hell, had it been one of the many doctors I&#39;d seen? Except that didn&#39;t make any sense - I hadn&#39;t started to see them until my breasts had already been growing. Then who?? Was I really just...chosen at random by some pervert??? Who the fuck would.....<br />
<br />
Would do something like...<br />
<br />
Oh...shit. <br />
<br />
No, no. It...no. That wasn&#39;t...it wasn&#39;t...<br />
<br />
Huh.<br />
<br />
When my breasts had first started to get big - like, bigger than what was normal - I remember an odd reaction. My Uncle Jim had been over for dinner, joking with my sister, when I&#39;d come in to the room. He&#39;d taken one look at me and then started choking on his food. He had been a pretty regular guest and usually joked around with me. But he&#39;d gone really pale and kinda sweaty when he&#39;d seen me. And when he came by the next week and saw that I&#39;d gotten visibly bigger in that time - he just got up and left without a word. From that point on, he had stopped coming around as much, and whenever he saw me, he had this weird demeanor and expression...I&#39;d thought it was pity at the time. But...it could also have been guilt...<br />
<br />
It couldn&#39;t...it couldn&#39;t have been my own Uncle could it? <br />
<br />
Why would he have done this to me?? It couldn&#39;t be possible...it couldn&#39;t be him...<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
It was then that I realized the growth of my breasts were beginning to slow. Was it...were they actually stopping? I started to cry from relief as I felt the sensation of pressure begin to lessen and the sensation of my breasts scraping across the ground begin to fade. Maybe it was my Uncle, maybe it wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
At least it seemed to finally be over.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Jim watched out the window with strained breathing as the billowing breasts of his niece swallowed up the entire neighborhood where he&#39;d grown up, and then began to crush the surrounding areas as well. Dust and debris rose into the air - military and news helicopters dotted the sky like flies. But all he could focus on was those breasts. Even at this insane size, they were still flawless. Perfect, unblemished skin - a beautiful sight...an awful sight...all a result of his random impulse fourteen years ago...all because of the ray-gun he once again held in his hand. A random ass purchase off of eBay. <br />
<br />
&quot;I should stop this,&quot; he muttered in a voice that sounded distant to his own ears. &quot;And then just go away. That&#39;d be the best thing for everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
But even as he said this, his finger twitched on the Breastinator. <br />
<br />
As he stared at those burgeoning breasts, he realized the growth was beginning to slow. It had been amazing, watching them pulse and jiggle with each burst of growth...but now they were beginning to settle...no longer visibly growing. That was...for the best. <br />
<br />
It was for the best.<br />
<br />
He slowly looked down at the ray-gun, and then back out at those massive mammary mountains.<br />
<br />
Silently, he turned and left his apartment, taking the stairs down - the elevator was in use from people trying to flee the building. He walked steadily, not really acknowledging anyone or anything around them. Outside, sirens blared and uniformed officers and firefighters rushed in all directions - though many were simply standing there with gaping mouths, unable to believe the sight that dominated the landscape. <br />
<br />
He walked down fifth street, his eyes focused on the twin mounds that cast shadows across the remaining half of the city. There was enough chaos on the street from people going in all directions that no one really paid any attention to him. <br />
<br />
Finally, he was only a couple blocks away - the breasts before him were so high that he couldn&#39;t even see the peak from his current vantage point. Somewhere up there was Bronwyn - he wondered briefly how it had felt. His ultimate fantasy, come to life...<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d held the trigger for maybe fifteen, twenty seconds all those years ago. Those handful of seconds had resulted in this. <br />
<br />
He lifted the Breastinator in his hand, aimed it at the breasts above, and pulled the trigger once more.<br />
<br />
And kept holding it down. <br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
When the growth had stopped, the soldiers had seemed very relieved. But that relief was nothing compared to my own. The pleasure had begun to ebb a bit - without being constantly stimulated by the sensations of the growth it wasn&#39;t nearly as overpowering. I&#39;d cried for a bit, in relief and sorrow. I wasn&#39;t ready to ask some tough questions yet - like what the end result of all this growth had been. How much destruction I&#39;d caused...how many people I may have...<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t want to think about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an extremely powerful device,&quot; the female soldier explained to me, kneeling next to my prone form. She&#39;d covered me with a blanket, which I did appreciate. I wasn&#39;t nearly as hostile towards them as I had been initially - now that the growth had stopped, I even thought it was kind of sweet. &quot;It was thought up in the fifties and brought to fruition in the sixties and seventies - hence it&#39;s extremely hokey looking design. But despite the dumb name and the dumb design - the power it has is...significant. It effects women&#39;s biology on a molecular level...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; I questioned. <br />
<br />
She looked down at me with a sad sort of smile. &quot;Honey...come on. It was researched by, designed by, paid for, and built by men.&quot;<br />
<br />
I actually growled at that. &quot;Fucking men.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded gravely. &quot;Fucking men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...so if you find my Un - find the person who did this, then it can be reversed? Even...even though I&#39;m this big?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When we find them, and yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god. I don&#39;t think I could stomach...&quot;<br />
<br />
I trailed off, a sudden shiver running up my spine. I tried to open my mouth, but - another shiver, another pulse from within my body. It felt like every hair was standing on end. And...<br />
<br />
&quot;Bronwyn? You alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Something was...something was wrong. I could feel...something. A sensation. Building up within me. I must have made a noise of some kind, because suddenly the female soldier was on her feet and calling for the others. The sensation built within me, making it hard to even breathe...what...what was this...<br />
<br />
The sudden stab of intense pleasure made my body feel as though every single nerve had been electrified. My pussy throbbed so hard that it made me see stars. I let out a completely primal scream and lost all control of my movements. The ground began to rumble - except - it wasn&#39;t the ground at all. It was my tits.<br />
<br />
They were growing. <br />
<br />
They were growing!! Again!<br />
<br />
And the pleasure, holy shit - it was building. And building!<br />
<br />
And building...! <br />
<br />
And there was no release! It just kept mounting - going up, more and more! It just kept building!<br />
<br />
The growth began to speed up. I whimpered, I screamed, I thrashed around in the throes of the suddenly overwhelming sensations. The soldiers were shouting something, but--<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t hear them. I couldn&#39;t even move. It felt that good. The last thing I really recall was seeing my breasts explode in size once more, rumbling across the city towards downtown...<br />
<br />
At some point, blissfully, thankfully...I blacked out.</p>
