<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Maybe when we get back?&quot; John suggested.<br />
<br />
Erin blushed. &quot;Yeah. Yeah, you&#39;re right. I guess I&#39;m just a little nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
John stood up and took Erin&#39;s hands in his, trying to be reassuring. &quot;You don&#39;t have to be. I&#39;m not freaked out, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Erin still sounded halfway mortified. &quot;That&#39;s a relief, because let me tell you, I did *not* intend for you to find out what I am this soon. Not unless we hit it off and it looked like this might be going somewhere. Not that I like lying to my dates, but—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s kind of a big secret, I get it,&quot; said John. &quot;I really do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don&#39;t,&quot; said Erin. &quot;Any time I&#39;ve ever tried to date a human guy that I liked—and there aren&#39;t really any other options around here—it&#39;s never gotten past the point of my telling them the truth. The moment I drop the glamour, they see the hooves, the fur, the flanks, and all of the sudden they&#39;re too grossed out to even touch me. And so they end it.&quot; She paused, looked away in disgust, and added, &quot;Well, except for this one guy, I thought he might be the one. But it turns out he liked horses better than people.&quot; Erin shot an accusatory glare at John and asked, &quot;You aren&#39;t—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo!&quot; said John, throwing up both hands. &quot;No way, nuh-uh. I can promise you that I am *not* a—what do you call—&#39;furry&#39; isn&#39;t exactly the right word—a zoophile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to sound like that. It&#39;s just that, well, you&#39;re the first normal-seeming guy I&#39;ve met who hasn&#39;t looked like he wants to *throw up* at the slightest thought of dating me.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took one of Erin&#39;s hands again and looked her in the eye. &quot;I guess you just don&#39;t seem all that weird to me.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Like I said earlier, I grew up reading sci-fi. The Chronicles of Narnia were some my favorite books as a kid. Read Tolkien, played D&D, played Final Fantasy; you know? I guess I just think centaurs are . . . kinda cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think me being a centaur is &#39;cool&#39;?&quot; said Erin. She sounded truly perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well . . . yeah. Your, um, your species is always portrayed in fantasy as, like, really badass and stuff. Knights and rangers and warriors, that sort of thing. Plus the star-gazing and future-telling. I don&#39;t know how far off all that is from the reality, but . . . I&#39;m curious to find out. If you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin grinned, and (to both her surprise and John&#39;s) blinked away some tears that she didn&#39;t know she was on the verge of shedding. She wiped her eyes and said, &quot;You know, you really are kind of a nerd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A badge I&#39;ll wear with pride,&quot; said John with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess it&#39;s the price I&#39;ll have to pay if I want to find a decent guy who won&#39;t go screaming down the street at the sight of me,&quot; said Erin half-seriously. &quot;So . . . how about that walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
John offered Erin his arm, and she wrapped her own around it. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
The city part was a few blocks away. John and Erin strolled down the sidewalks together arm-in-arm, and John was surprised to note that Erin wasn&#39;t drawing *any* stares. Even a normal human girl as pretty as Erin (and wearing a babydoll t-shirt stretched over tits as big as hers) should have been drawing more than discreet glances from every guy they passed. But instead, it was as if nobody noticed her at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those magic horseshoes of yours are really something,&quot; commented John. &quot;I wonder why in the heck they didn&#39;t work on me—not that I&#39;m complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Illusions don&#39;t always work on the very perceptive or the very strong-willed,&quot; said Erin. &quot;And some people can just sort of see through them—if they have a psychic talent, like a knack for ESP.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m psychic,&quot; said John, &quot;and I don&#39;t know about willpower or whatever. But maybe it&#39;s the &#39;perceptive&#39; thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Erin. The park was in sight now, and they altered their path to head towards it. &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of what I do for a living. I&#39;m a writer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin stopped short, all four of her hooves quietly &quot;clopping&quot; on the pavement together. John, his arm still linked with Erin&#39;s, almost stumbled. &quot;You&#39;re *that* John Robertson? The novel writer!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s me,&quot; said John, his face reddening. In point of fact, he wrote fantasy novels—urban fantasy novels, about magical creatures living in the modern-day world—and if Erin had read them and knew that, he&#39;d probably never live it down. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve read anything of mine? The &#39;Mage-Noir Alley&#39; series?&quot; He winced, waiting for the inevitable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? I *love* those books! And—&quot; Erin paused and covered an ear-to-ear grin with one hand, &quot;—one of your main characters is a centaur!&quot;<br />
<br />
John was already nodding along. &quot;Detective Jackson&#39;s police liaison, Lt. Ftiz McCampbell—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Who could put hooves to pavement better than any detective in the precinct, and half the mounted cops to boot!&#39; &quot; she quoted, laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, now I&#39;m just embarrassed,&quot; said John. &quot;I must have gotten so many details wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
They crossed under the archway into the park proper, and now they strolled along neatly-maintained paths between grassy hillocks, flower-patches, and little copses of trees. There was a bridge over a babbling brook up ahead where an old man had a fishing rod out over the water; and in a distant field, some picnickers were playing frisbee with their dog. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not like we can expect humans who don&#39;t know anything about us to get all the little details right,&quot; said Erin. &quot;That wouldn&#39;t be fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I guess not,&quot; said John. &quot;But I can already tell that I was way off the mark. Your size, for one thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin followed John&#39;s gaze and looked back over her shoulder, at her equine flanks, her tail swishing jauntily behind her as she trotted. &quot;What about my size?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in stories, centaurs are always—you know. Big. Big enough for a person to ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin giggled. &quot;I&#39;m plenty strong. I could carry you on my back if you really wanted me to.&quot; She cocked a thumb at the old man on the bridge behind them, who was still totally focused on watching the bobber on his fishing-line. &quot;But *he* might think it was kind of weird, seeing a little slip of a girl like me giving a big ol&#39; hunk like you a piggyback-ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that how your illusion magic works? People just see whatever makes the most sense to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much. In fact—&quot; Erin pulled John by the hand until they were both off the path and trotting down a grassy embankment, down to the edge of a still little pond that was fed by the brook. She stood arm-in-arm with John, and they both leaned over the water and peered in. &quot;Tell me what you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked and spied their reflections. &quot;I see—us. Except, you&#39;re not really you.&quot; Sure enough, the reflected Erin in the pond appeared to be a normal human girl in a daisy-yellow sun-dress.<br />
<br />
As they headed back toward the path, John asked, &quot;How come the reflected illusion still works on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that even works on *me*,&quot; said Erin. &quot;That just how the magic works. That way, if I need to make sure the spell is still active, I can always just look in a mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s handy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-hm.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got back on the path and resumed their stroll. John, overcome by curiosity, asked, &quot;So is it really the case that all centaurs are about your size, or are there, like, different—um—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Different &#39;breeds&#39;?&quot; suggested Erin. &quot;It&#39;s okay, you can ask this kind of stuff. I won&#39;t get offended, or think you&#39;re calling me a horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
John chuckled nervously. &quot;I just don&#39;t want to say the wrong thing and ruin our date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin leaned her head on John&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;It&#39;s actually going pretty well so far, isn&#39;t it? Anyway, to answer your question, no, there aren&#39;t Clydesdale centaurs and Shetland centaurs. Our horse-halves are always pretty much sized to match our human halves. Just like in the paintings on those Ancient Greek urns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it would make things kind of awkward otherwise,&quot; said John. &quot;Then we couldn&#39;t hold hands like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we wouldn&#39;t be compatible if we went to bed together,&quot; said Erin. Then she stopped in her tracks, covered her mouth with both hands, and turned bright, beet red in the face. &quot;I mean—I don&#39;t know why I said that—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; said John, forcing a laugh to ease the tension. In truth, he&#39;d been kind of worried about that, and so he decided to press the issue, and hopefully make Erin more comfortable with discussing it. &quot;Since you brought it up, I&#39;m kind of glad to finally know. That we can be &#39;compatible,&#39; I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin, still blushing fiercely, said, &quot;I *did* already tell you that humans and centaurs can have children together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you did,&quot; said John, &quot;but that&#39;s not exactly the same thing as knowing that a human and a centaur can, you know, enjoy each other&#39;s company in the bedroom. What I mean is, I&#39;m sure that compared to a male of your species, there&#39;s no way that I can—measure up—&quot;<br />
<br />
Now John was blushing and stammering too, and Erin said, &quot;Can we please just talk about *anything* else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; John thought for a moment and then said, &quot;You know that I&#39;m a writer. What do you do for a living?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin then told him that she was a . . .</p>
