<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you sure this is the place?&quot; asked Liam.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the address I was given.&quot; Nick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it doesn&#39;t even look like a business.&quot; Matt said. &quot;This place looks so run down, I doubt anyone has been here in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s why we were all sent.&quot; said Andy. &quot;The instructions just said get the items on the list, no purchase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would still only take two people.&quot; said Jake. &quot;Why send six of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you.&quot; said Kyle. &quot;This must be a frat stunt. We&#39;re all six the pledges.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy said, &quot;But it&#39;s illegal to haze pledges.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;It is illegal but it still happens. The law only gets involved if someone gets injured. Even then, if the pledges don&#39;t sue, there&#39;s no case. This is probably going to be some mild hazing such as being dropped in a pool of icy water. That&#39;s why I wore clothes I don&#39;t mind getting dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----Nick&#39;s POV-----<br />
<br />
I knocked on the door. There wasn&#39;t a sound. The whole place looked empty and that time of night, the street looked empty too. There were a few lights, mostly street lights but it was dark. Then I heard some noises inside. I didn&#39;t recognize all the noises but I did hear footsteps approaching the door and the door opened. The man looked to be in his late twenties with a scraggly beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I help you?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
I answered &quot;I was told to get some things here.&quot; I showed him the list which was signed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. We&#39;ve been expecting you.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Kyle said &quot;Told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake jabbed him and said &quot;Hush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me scruffy.&quot; said the man at the door. &quot;The other guy is cyclops.&quot;<br />
<br />
He motioned us to come in and Cyclops was standing there with a patch over his eye. I&#39;m sure it was a joke because both Scruffy and Cyclops looked like they were trying to look scary.<br />
<br />
Scruffy said, &quot;What you&#39;re looking for is right through there in the last door.&quot; He pointed down a hallway.<br />
<br />
I went first and Liam, Matt, and Andy came with me but Kyle and Jake hung back. The door was locked and I told Scruffy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t open until all of you go there.&quot; Scruffy said.<br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;I told you, I told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy, gullible as ever said &quot;But hazing is illegal. This doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;If my shirt gets ruined I&#39;m suing.&quot; but he and Kyle joined the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Cyclops laughed and I have to admit, his laugh sounded authentically creepy. &quot;You won&#39;t have to worry about your shirt. Nothing is going to happen to your shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
When all six of us were in the hallway, I reached for the doorknob again but I couldn&#39;t move. My fingertips were an inch from the doorknob and I couldn&#39;t move. I guessed my fellow pledges were in the same state. I couldn&#39;t see much behind me but I heard movement. Scruffy and Cyclops didn&#39;t talk much but they sounded happy. What little they said sounded like, &quot;That worked out just right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their movement got closer to me and I noticed when Liam and Matt were removed from behind me. Then finally they came up beside me and because I was looking down, I noticed that they had very thick soled industrial shoes and they had put on some form of HAZMAT suits. That must be why they weren&#39;t paralyzed. They attached something to my back before moving me and whatever it was kept me immobile. They then picked me up and carried me.<br />
<br />
They set me down in what looked like a factory with large conveyor belts and machines. They removed my shoes and socks and attached a chain to my ankle connecting me to one of the conveyer belt. Liam and Matt were on the same conveyer belt but each of the rest of us was on a different conveyer belt. Then they started removing the things they had attached to our backs.<br />
<br />
They removed Andy&#39;s first and he asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyclops walked up to Andy nose to nose and said, &quot;We&#39;re going to eat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy started screaming this ear piercing high pitched scream. Scruffy and Cyclops started laughing but trying to calm him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can scream all you want but it&#39;s a waste of breath.&quot; Scruffy said, &quot;Do you really think we&#39;re trying to eat you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy kept screaming till he was out of breath. He took a big breath and screamed some more. Scruffy and Cyclops just covered their ears and stood in front of him asking &quot;Are you through yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Andy was finally through, Scruffy said &quot;Now listen, Andy right, we&#39;re not going to hurt you. Your friend Kyle is right. We&#39;re only going to play some harmless pranks on you and send you back to your fraternity. There&#39;s no need to scream.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they removed Kyle&#39;s stasis whatever &quot;How do you know our names?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy said &quot;We were given pictures and instructions of course. We knew to expect all of you. We just had to make sure we got the right six guys when you arrived.&quot;<br />
<br />
They finished removing all the rest of our stasis and we could move around except we couldn&#39;t leave our conveyor belts. Then they handed us drinks and told us to drink them. My drink tasted like Pepto Bismol and whiskey but it was so small that I finished it before I realized I didn&#39;t like it. Jake hadn&#39;t drank his yet and asked why we were supposed to drink them.<br />
<br />
Scruffy said &quot;They will help you enjoy yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
After we&#39;d all drank whatever it was, Scruffy and Cyclops began gathering our shirts.<br />
<br />
Jake asked, &quot;Why do you want our shirts?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyclops said, &quot;You don&#39;t want your shirt ruined do you?&quot; then he laughed.<br />
<br />
After gathering our shirts, they asked for our pants.<br />
<br />
Andy said, &quot;This is against the law. I refuse. You can&#39;t make me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyclops grabbed Andy and Scruffy removed his pants. Andy screamed the whole time.<br />
<br />
Scruffy stood up and said &quot;You are all going to cooperate. There is no backing out. I thought you were all supposed to be men, men worthy of the fraternity. Don&#39;t chicken out over your pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle said &quot;Uh, I&#39;m not wearing anything under my pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy said &quot;That&#39;s okay. We&#39;re taking your underwear too.&quot; and he yanked Andy&#39;s underwear down. He used a second chain to help him get all the clothes away from Andy.<br />
<br />
Jake asked &quot;Why do you want us naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy asked &quot;Are you going to chicken out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said &quot;No, but this better not be some pervy thing. You shove anything up my ass, I&#39;ll sue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy said, &quot;Jake right, nothing is going up your ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle and Jake took their pants off without help and I did too. Liam and Matt hesitated but they stripped down too.<br />
<br />
Then Cyclops flipped a lever and Liam and Matt&#39;s conveyor belt started moving. Cyclops flipped the lever and Liam and Matt&#39;s belt stopped moving. Then Cyclops started Kyle moving but stopped him. Then Andy who jumped and nearly fell. Cyclops was teasing us, causing us to move closer to the machines but randomly. It was like a game of anticipation not knowing what to expect inside the machines and not knowing when or if we were even going in. When I was right next to the first machine, Scruffy came over and talked to me.<br />
<br />
Scruffy said, &quot;Now before you go in, I need you to lay down feet first. I want you to put your hands behind your head and pretend like you&#39;re relaxing on a beach except spread your legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was the first one going in. I laid down and watched as my feet went inside the machine. I felt a pressure squeezing my feet. It felt like deep pressure but it felt good. I saw Scruffy reach in through a side access and remove my ankle chain. Then the pressure continued up my legs. When it got to the top of my legs, I felt Scruffy hands on my privates manipulating them but I was too embarrassed to say anything. Then I felt something penetrate my ass.<br />
<br />
I whispered, &quot;Psst, psst, Scruffy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He came over and bent his ear to me.<br />
<br />
I whispered, &quot;I thought nothing was going up our asses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy whispered back, &quot;Nothing is going up Jake&#39;s ass. We got very good instructions about all six of you. We know who to do what to.&quot;<br />
<br />
I whispered, &quot;But I&#39;m not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy said, &quot;I know. You just like to play around with toys sometimes.&quot; Then he went back to work.<br />
<br />
Whatever was inside of me was removed and the pressure continued up my body but somehow missed my genitals. The guys kept asking what was happening to me and I didn&#39;t tell them. I just said that it felt strange. Then my head went inside the machine and Scruffy lifted my head. The pressure was caused by large rollers. He separated the rollers around my head and I saw that the rest of my body had been flattened except my genitals. I gasped because I didn&#39;t even know this was possible. It defied all the laws of science I knew.<br />
<br />
Scruffy continued flattening my arms and then left me lay there while he worked on the next guy. I got a boner just looking at myself and I tried to will it down. I didn&#39;t want the other guys to see it but I couldn&#39;t hide it since, other than my head, my boner was the only part of me not flattened. Also there was something under my butt elevating it.<br />
<br />
Scruffy gave different instructions to Liam and Matt. I couldn&#39;t see anyone on the other side of the machines but when Liam and Matt came out on my side, they were completely bent at the waist beyond anything a contortionist could do. They were standing on their feet but their asses were pointing straight up. Their torso had been made into a complete loop so that they were now looking at their own asses. Their heads were upright but behind their asses.<br />
<br />
Liam immediately started sucking his cock which was right there at his lips. Matt spat his cock away and walked over to talk to me but as he spoke, his cock kept falling in his mouth. Liam was able to deep throat himself swallowing his entire cock.<br />
<br />
Matt said, &quot;Well this is certainly not what I expected. I hope no one sees us like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam spit his cock out for a moment and said, &quot;Just go with it. I&#39;m enjoying myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake was the next one through and he looked just like Matt and Liam, bent around himself. Kyle was also bent around himself.<br />
<br />
Andy was the last one through a machine. He came out without arms or legs. He complained loudly and Scruffy reassured us that Andy&#39;s arms and legs were just smushed in, not cut off.<br />
<br />
Scruffy gathered us together and asked &quot;Who&#39;s ready for more.&quot; and Liam volunteered. I asked why Jake and Kyle went through different machines and Scruffy explained &quot;There are slight differences that will be more noticeable as we go along.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was in conflict with myself. On the one hand, I felt violated and felt like I should protest but whatever I drank caused me to feel calm and submissive.<br />
<br />
Liam came out of the machine with a huge gaping butt hole. It was large enough to fit his head inside. Matt asked if the same thing was going to be done to him.<br />
<br />
Scruffy answered, &quot;Our instructions are that Matt and Liam are to have identical treatment.&quot; Matt volunteered and came back with his own huge butt hole.<br />
<br />
Jake said &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this anymore. This is pervy stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy said &quot;Well okay, if you insist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam and Matt were ready to go on and when they came back this time, they had shrunk very tiny. They went again and came back with their skin as white as alabaster. They wanted to go again but Scruffy said &quot;Nope, your finished. We don&#39;t have anything more to do to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle spoke up &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll go on. I&#39;m not afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
He came back with his head and butt pushed away from each other. The space between his head and butt was flattened.<br />
<br />
Jake asked, &quot;You didn&#39;t stretch his asshole like you did the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy said &quot;No, we have different instructions for each one of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll give another try.&quot;<br />
<br />
He came back with his asshole relocated to a hidden spot beneath him.<br />
<br />
Jake said &quot;I think I might like this after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
I began to think about the list we were given. I couldn&#39;t remember everything on the list but then it clicked. There were six items on the list and there were six of us. The list included two candle holders and Liam and Matt looked like two candle holders. The list also included a table and Kyle was looking like a table except I thought the table was supposed to be bigger. I couldn&#39;t remember what else was on the list.<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;What am I supposed to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scruffy asked &quot;You want to find out?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Sure what&#39;s next?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyclops brought out a large, flat piece of wood that had a cutout in it. They picked me up and laid me out inside the cutout and stretched me a little to fit before gluing me in place. Kyle wasn&#39;t the table. I was. But I was still a weird looking table.<br />
<br />
I went ahead and took the next step and they put some sort of hardening finish on me until my body couldn&#39;t move. Before applying it to my cock, they jerked me until I had the hardest hard-on I&#39;ve ever had. Then they made it harder. Everything from my neck down was now completely solid and immobile. They leaned me against a wall while I watched the rest.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s mouth was stretched into a large basin. His cock was fashioned like a faucet with his balls as the hot and cold knobs. He was a drinking fountain.<br />
<br />
Kyle had a lot of changes still to go but when he came out, he was a serving tray. His ass hole was a cup holder. His penis was a handle so he could be picked up. He still had his head so he could see where he was going since he also had his legs and could walk around. They also shrunk him, not as small as Liam and Matt but small enough that he could be placed on a table walking around serving guests.<br />
<br />
Finally, they took Andy even though he didn&#39;t volunteer. They removed his penis and turned it into a white board marker. The flattened the rest of him except his head into a white board.<br />
<br />
All of us still had our heads and none of our heads had changed shape but the rest of us was completely changed around.<br />
<br />
They finally finished me up but attaching one large table leg screwed into my ass hole. Then they put a single rose down my piss slit so my cock was now a vase and we were ready: a table, a drinking fountain, a serving tray, a white board, and two candle holders.<br />
<br />
Scruffy and Cyclops loaded us into a van and took us back to the frat house. As they unloaded us, I heard someone say, &quot;Hey, just in time for the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I had a moment, I asked about the party but no one answered me. They just said, &quot;You&#39;ll be the centerpiece of the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
I saw that they had removed the water fountain that is normally in the entry way and told Jake they needed to plug the plumbing into his asshole.<br />
<br />
Jake asked, &quot;Do I have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Andy was hanging on the wall. Kyle, Liam and Matt were standing on me while a long candle was being shoved in Liam&#39;s ass.</p>
