<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate laid on his bed, watching the sun set from his bedroom window. It was currently Friday night and he listened as his parents were packing their bags for a weekend mini-break leaving him home all alone. They felt confident leaving him alone, trusting him to stay out of trouble and stay safe. If only they knew, thought Nate. He listened clearly as they discussed what they were going to do on their trip. That was one of the many bonuses of his newfound condition, enhanced hearing. He also found he had increased endurance, sense of smell and strength. It did not, however, automatically make him better at basketball, so that section of gym class remained another embarrassing chapter in his life.  He smiled to himself contently, knowing in a few short hours he would be transforming from man to beast again. <br />
<br />
He laid there on his bed, reflecting on how just a couple months ago, while walking home from his friend Jamie&#39;s house, he got attacked by a strange animal. He was able to fight it off but not before it bit him good and hard on his upper arm. He then went home, bandaged himself up and went to bed. Thinking back on it, Nate is amazed he never went to a doctor and got a rabies shot. Thankfully, he didn&#39;t get rabies, but he did get something else: Lycanthropy. Nate didn&#39;t completely realize it until the following month when, to both his shock and amazement, under the light of the waxing full moon his fingernails became claws, he grew fur, fangs and ripped apart his clothes in the process as he went from teenage boy to full fledged werewolf. He woke up the following morning in the woods behind his house, and managed to sneak inside before his parents were up. Initially he was both scared and exhilarated at what had happened. As a long time horror and monster freak, he had long related to the werewolf the most and had longed to be one and now he was. But there was also a fear he&#39;d hurt someone, but each time he&#39;d scour the news and no reports of animals attacking people and he retraced his steps the best he could but the most he ever killed as the wolf was a large stag. <br />
<br />
This had been two months ago and now Nate was beginning to get the hang of his monthly transformations, coming up with some excuse or another to cover for his nightly absences. During the week, he&#39;d just say he had a lot of homework and ask not to be disturbed. But this was a weekend. Thankfully, his parents were going to be gone. They were supposed to be leaving soon and it was already getting late. He looked outside again and the sun was setting. His transformation would be starting soon. He knew he couldn&#39;t leave until they did so he wished they would hurry up.  He sat up in bed as the anxiety rose. It was coming soon, he could feel it. He looked down at his hands and they were already showing short dark brown hairs. He watched in horror as his thin fingernails split apart and the thick, sharp claws began to grow out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...please...stop...&quot; whispered Nate, pleading with the unseen force determined to turn him from boy to beast in front of his parents. Mercifully, there was a knock at the door. Instinctively, Nate quickly sat on his transforming hands as his folks, Derek and Maggie, walked in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re off. We left money on the counter as well as where we would be staying. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re capable of keeping yourself out of trouble.&quot; said his father. <br />
<br />
Nate nodded. &quot;Yep, looking forward to a quiet weekend at home.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s dad turned and walked downstairs with the suitcases and Nate&#39;s mom walked over to the bed and quickly gave her son a hug and kiss goodbye. Nate hugged her back, careful not to let her see his transforming hands. She then stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re starting to get scruffy. Time to start shaving, young man.&quot; said his Mom. &quot;When we get back, we&#39;ll go out and get you an electric razor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, have a safe trip!&quot; replied Nate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, hon.&quot; replied his Mom as she walked downstairs. Nate watched from his bedroom window as his parent&#39;s car backed down the driveway and drove down the street. He immediately started pulling his clothes off, he could feel the transformation coming on fast and heavy now. He had to get out of the house. He didn&#39;t trust his wolf side not to destroy the place. He made his way downstairs, stumbling as his feet began to reform into digitigrade paws. His transformation was excruciating every step of the way, but on a certain level, Nate enjoyed it. He could taste the blood in his mouth as his fangs grew in. The burning as his body grew and reformed and the intense itching as his fur grew in, thick and coarse over his entire body. <br />
<br />
He made it to the patio door and flung it open, stepping out onto the concrete patio and turning off the patio light. He closed the patio door and took two steps before he dropped to his knees, crying out as the transformation reached it&#39;s peak. His ears grew to points and slid up his head as his face slowly, agonizingly pushed out into a lupine snout. New scents flooded his nose as the werewolf rose up and looked around, letting out a low growl before running off into the night.</p>
