<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first tries were predictable. <br />
<br />
Erica's armor was, like something out of Conan The Barbarian, looking more <br />
like a metal bikini than something meant to protect one's self from deadly <br />
deadly beasts. Erica smiled, Tabra did not. Tabra painfully pulled two feathers <br />
from Tabra's mundane wings. And with a totally straight face, began to tickle <br />
Erica until she was in tears on the ground begging for mercy. <br />
<br />
Luna's armor was thick, power, and easily resistant to any melee attack that <br />
the other threw at it. Luna looked rather confident with herself standing in her <br />
armor in a heroic pose. Tabra calmly walked up to her, and with two fingers <br />
gently pushed her. Still stuck in that exactly same pose in her inflexible armor, <br />
and a look of shock and confusion on her face, Luna fell over backward like a <br />
statue hitting the ground leaving an impression. <br />
<br />
Viki's armor was comfortable, flexible, and didn't restrict her movement at all, <br />
as she demonstrated to everyone proudly. Tabra created a butter knife and <br />
lightly stabbed her in the leg showing that it also had all the density of canvas. <br />
<br />
Lisa accidently began choking on her own armor the moment she summoned <br />
it, having made it tight where she had meant to make it loose and loose where <br />
she had meant to make it tight. In alarm Tabra quickly undid the angelic armor <br />
around Lisa's breathing passages just as Lisa started to turn blue under her <br />
fur. <br />
<br />
Tabra slapped her own face and mentally sighed, 'I wonder if this is what Mike <br />
felt like when training me...'<br />
<br />
Janice however, took note of each of her sisters mistakes, remember what <br />
Tabra had taught her, figuring out some flaws in her own attempts to modify <br />
their armor to suit their new body. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
No one questioned when Tabra said session two for the day was crucifix <br />
creation. After all, they had all been on the receiving end of 'T's' and knew <br />
exactly what it could do. <br />
<br />
After the disaster with the armors, and having learned from their mistakes, <br />
creating the metal went with only one help question from Erica. Shaping it had <br />
also been a lot easier than the armors, and went on with only slight help from <br />
Tabra. But turned them into little mirrors of their own angelic essence. On this <br />
each of them crashed and burned. Lisa and Erica pushed the process too <br />
fast, making the ethereal energies break apart before they had matured. Lisa <br />
had weaved the ethereal threads well enough around the holy symbol, but <br />
make it reflect her angelic self proved too tricky and the aura it gave off was <br />
totally vague. Viki got the farthest along. The cross was made into the proper <br />
shape, the invisible threads were woven into the matter, it was even was able <br />
to properly reflect her spirit. Tabra even praised her for doing as well as she <br />
did. She made but one simple but stupid mistake. She had left the bindings <br />
open, leaving it totally naked to tampering. Tabra pointed out that could easily <br />
lead to trouble later on. Viki took what Tabra said as honest advice, after all, <br />
they were in Tabra's field of expertise. <br />
<br />
Again, sitting alongside Tabra, Janice took note of everything, memorizing it <br />
as best she could, practicing it over and over in her mind's eye. This proved <br />
rather useful since Tabra had a view of her mental TV screen as well she was <br />
able to point flaws in her scenario that Janice was able to correct. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
As per Julio's idea, he trained two of the angels in hand to hand combat, while <br />
Tabra taught them weapon to weapon combat, then after a few hours switch <br />
pupils. One of the things Tabra showed them was indeed they had to expect <br />
the unexpected. Tabra fought them with a dagger, shifted it back into proto-<br />
matter and into a tasers and gave them both an intense electric shock. <br />
<br />
The weapons that Tabra's students created of course were crude at first, basic <br />
shapes made of basic material. But this was one area that all of them, in <br />
particular Erica, followed closely by Luna, were able to improve upon quickly. <br />
All he had to do was explain to them was that it took some on your feet <br />
thinking and a good imagination. Still he had to keep reminding them that just <br />
cause they had created one weapon, didn't mean they had to stick with that <br />
weapon. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
After purposely being -very- rough with them in the last rounds of the combat <br />
exercise, Tabra -showed- them how to properly heal injuries on the fly, on <br />
yourself and on others. Mending bones, closing skin, and repairing organs <br />
was something Tabra could do easily, she was very sure that the recruits -all- <br />
understood even in their sleep that they had to have a full grasp of the subject <br />
before trying it themselves. And that would wait until tomorrow when <br />
everything she had had time to sink in. Lisa listened intently to each word. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
All in all, it proved to be a very rough and trying first day for teacher and <br />
students alike. Of course, all of the recruit managed to walk away with <br />
something. Tabra was impressed they didn't crawl away in exhaustion. <br />
<br />
&quot;You've all earned yourselves a rest today. Of course.&quot; Tabra said those <br />
fateful words. &quot;Now that you all have the basics down... tomorrow we get <br />
started for real!&quot; <br />
<br />
The recruits all paled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Want to hear something crazy?&quot; Viki asked her three little sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one more for the day.&quot; Erica said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't wait for tomorrow.&quot; Viki confessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, crazy.&quot; Luna rolled over to get the sleep she knew she'd be needing in <br />
the morning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... crazy like a fox.&quot; Erica couldn't help but say. <br />
<br />
Lisa made a slight giggle. It sounded like sleigh bells at christmas. It was <br />
enough to lull the recruit to sleep. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
'Tabra.' Janice said, Tabra saw the mental pictures running through her half of <br />
their mind. 'I -need- ask you, I need to try it!' Of course Tabra knew what 'it' <br />
was. <br />
<br />
'It right about time for you to ask.' Tabra said calmly. 'This is around the time it <br />
kicks in. It's base nature for you. I suspect the recruit will feel the exact same <br />
urge some time later tomorrow. You getting it out of your system today actually <br />
works better so you can help them too.' <br />
<br />
'So it's just, 'natural then to feel this?'<br />
<br />
'What did you expect? You, WE are an angel.'<br />
<br />
'Then show me Tabra, please teach me, teach me how to fly.' <br />
<br />
'Janice, by the time we're helping the recruit through this base desire all <br />
angels feel, you'll see the even without wings, you can still fly.' <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
A teleportation done totally by Janice only with a mental image form Tabra, in <br />
another part of the world. The angel fox stood on top of a mountain, above the <br />
cloud level. Her angelic form resisting the lack of atmosphere. She breathed <br />
what wisps of it there was into her lungs, not damaging them in the least. She <br />
looked at the moon, the same no matter what of the world you were in. The <br />
stars, ever so slightly different depending on where you were. It was like the <br />
clouds really were just another type of ground she could dance on. <br />
<br />
'You can.' Tabra reminded her. <br />
<br />
There was no way in high Heaven or the deepest Hell that Tamthis would <br />
sense her here. Even Tamthis' power had limits, for one, there wasn't any <br />
sand for hundreds of miles of this mountain peak, and there was just <br />
something about this mountain that repelled perverted and deviant forces like <br />
the ones Karther had controlled. This was also Tabra had picked out this <br />
place to be the spot for the sisters' 'outing tomorrow.' Why teaching them to fly <br />
with both their mundane and True Wings -was- an important part of their <br />
training. It was also, Tabra knew without a doubt, going to be the most <br />
wonderful. <br />
<br />
'Don't let fear stop you Janice, there is nothing to fear, you won't fall. You can <br />
fly.'<br />
<br />
'Think happy thoughts?'<br />
<br />
'Only if that makes it easier for you. Now spread your wings, no, not those <br />
pieces of feathers and bones connected to your back. Your -true- wings. Yes... <br />
that's yet. Let go of your doubts and fears, and just... fly.'<br />
<br />
The simple dress Janice/Tabra was wearing dissolved back into proto matter <br />
and vanished. Leaving the vixen with nothing between her and the natural <br />
world. <br />
<br />
Eyes closed, Janice lifted a few inches off the ground, not even upsetting dust. <br />
And then, she fell. <br />
<br />
Hardly! <br />
<br />
With unearthly but loving grace Janice flew down the mountain side, and <br />
changed angle just as she would have gone through the cloud layer, <br />
skimming around the surface. She then flew upwards, did several loop-de-<br />
loops and corkscrews. She had never felt so alive, so free. And in this <br />
moment, she totally forgot about Tabra. About being originally male. About <br />
having been a slave. At having her mind and body violated. About having her <br />
old beliefs shattered. There was only the total absolute -freedom- she felt in <br />
this one moment! <br />
<br />
With unearthly but loving grace Tabra flew down the mountain side, and <br />
changed angle just as she would have gone through the cloud layer, <br />
skimming around the surface. She then flew upwards, did several loop-de-<br />
loops and corkscrews. It had been forever since she had so alive, so free. And <br />
in this moment, she totally forgot about Janice. About being originally male in <br />
body. About having been turned into Tammia's second body. At having her <br />
mind and body violated. About having to fight a war for so, so long. There was <br />
only the total absolute -freedom- she felt in this one moment! <br />
<br />
Janice/Tabra started and gasped as they hit the very edge of the upper <br />
atmosphere. She nearly fell back down to Earth in free fall. <br />
<br />
'Tabra!' Janice thought. 'Was that, was that, was that really-'<br />
<br />
'I think. That was, the closest we've come to having our thoughts, not just our <br />
actions, totally and perfectly parallel.'<br />
<br />
'First... first signs of the... merging?'<br />
<br />
'Maybe... likely... '<br />
<br />
'Can we go home now.' Janice didn't bother to question how she thought of <br />
that hole in the ground with no way to the surface where her sisters were as <br />
her home. <br />
<br />
'Yes we can. Just answer me one question honestly.'<br />
<br />
'You can read my mind for the answer.'<br />
<br />
'It's for you.'<br />
<br />
'Okay.'<br />
<br />
'Do you regret coming here, or flying, at all?'<br />
<br />
'...no. I don't.' <br />
<br />
'Then don't fear the future.' <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
'Tabra I've been thinking.' Janice thought when they were alone in their <br />
spartan room again. She had been fiddling with the armor ever since coming <br />
back here, and was on a completely different level from before. <br />
<br />
'I know, I could hear you.'<br />
<br />
'So what's the answer?' <br />
<br />
'Stop thinking like a human, icons, logos, and crests are material things <br />
ultimately for when ideas can't be expressed directly.'<br />
<br />
'I know -but-, except for you, we all used to be human, I think it can help in the <br />
transition. And didn't you tell me -I'd- be making their armors? Why'd you put <br />
them through those lessons then?'<br />
<br />
'Because it's still good practice, it helps teach them how to use their abilities. <br />
Even if the job will ultimately fall on you.'<br />
<br />
'Then let me do my job the way I think it can best get done. If the armors are <br />
done in a similar style with with some sort of &quot;family insignia&quot; it'll be a big <br />
moral boost. They begin to actually -feel- that they're part of something greater <br />
than just being told they are.'<br />
  <br />
Janice saw Tabra running all the possible out comes and scenarios through <br />
his half of their mind. 'All right. Just remember, this isn't a magical girl TV <br />
show. We're going out there to fight, not look pretty for the cameras.' <br />
<br />
'I'll remember.' Janice promised. 'But I know you won't forget.'<br />
<br />
'Okay. But first, let's finnish on customizing -our- armor before you start making <br />
theirs. I can tell you were paying attention in class.'<br />
<br />
'Why thank you teacher.'<br />
<br />
'You're welcome.' <br />
<br />
She moved and altered the unearthly metal with her hands, but even more so <br />
with her mind's eyes and carefully manipulating the matter. <br />
<br />
The inflexible pieces of the armor were easy to make after watching Luna, <br />
and the parts that were supposed to move and breath were much easier <br />
thanks to Viki, or course Janice's parts couldn't be penetrated by a butter <br />
knife. The pieces of material that went around the body binding the fixed <br />
shape components of the armor were like a million fine metallic cords. They <br />
flex when she flexed, they allowed her fur to breath yet at the same time were <br />
perfectly water and -sand- proof. This armor could never be put on or <br />
removed practically by mundane means, the cords were far too small and just <br />
far too many of them. Summoning a sword and striking the cords that <br />
surrounded her arm, Janice would have never guessed they weren't a single <br />
piece except of course when she moved her arm muscles. <br />
<br />
'You've got the basic down Janice... now you can truly begin.'<br />
<br />
'I intend to.' And so Janice began to work into the night.</p>
