<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say Project Return did not cause disruptions to 'life as normal' would be untrue, as with <br />
any major sociological event it made waves. In particular when you uncover a conspiracy <br />
over a thousand years in the continuation. But contrary to the warnings of nay sayers it <br />
did not cause the collapse of human civilization. This was due in a large part of eastern <br />
culture's tendency to accept things for as they are, and western culture innate talent for <br />
staying true to one's sacred routine of 'wake up, go to work, go home, read a book/watch <br />
TV, go to bed.'  <br />
<br />
There were of course the practical problems that would come up, such what bathroom <br />
should asexual and bisexual lifeforms be allowed and not allowed to use? And the <br />
question of weather certain central pieces of popular culture and sociological wit <br />
(including &quot;Good Omens&quot; by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman) could now be considered <br />
prejudice or slander given the testifying existence of certain entities (to the credits of <br />
many a fantasy author's lawyer, no one was found guilty of anything in light of the <br />
enforced ignorance of the existence of said beings' existence).<br />
<br />
Not to mention people now turning slightly and so slightly paranoid and taking (perhaps <br />
overdue) extra precautions learning the things that went bump in the night were actual. <br />
Thank Heavens (literally in some cases) this was balanced out by the assurance that the <br />
things that skipped during the day were actual as well. <br />
<br />
This is not to say there were not good things, in particular the inner circle of corporate <br />
vampires (which was much smaller than the conspiracy theorists thought) could no longer <br />
suck the life out of a business rival then leave their bleeding corpse in a bath tube to pass <br />
it off as suicide. While some vampire hunters missed the thrill of always hiding in the <br />
shadows along with the curse enslaved being they targeted, many found it a breath of <br />
fresh air no longer having to waste half their time making up BS cover stories to explain <br />
while this man who owned a strangely large estate in spite of not legally existing ten year <br />
prior had a stake through his heart (the fact that vampires were technically already dead <br />
with the soulless corpse going through the motions via a curse also let a couple vampire <br />
hunters out of death row). And of course being dead, meant trying their hardest to keep <br />
their business empires from crumbling around them as it was logically pointed out the <br />
dead could not own property or shares.<br />
<br />
Project Return also annoyed many drug gangs who could no longer simply bite someone <br />
and wait till the next full moon for the new recruit. This also however meant resources <br />
used for cover ups could now be used to help said people overcome their curse's <br />
programming. This was particularly challenging for those born into a were family had <br />
heard 'The Voice' (their curse) all their lives. <br />
<br />
And the precious few dragons that still existed in the world (but still just as beautiful and <br />
frightening) saw a chance to increase their cash reserves by renting their services to <br />
certain armies to the highest bidder, and the face of war changed. (This had the secondary <br />
motive and added bonus that as long as they were under a flag when burning something, <br />
they had nothing to fear from being attacked by dragon slayers in their own lairs since <br />
they were as much razing the landscape for their own profit as the next mercenary <br />
company and thus were protected by law). <br />
<br />
Atheists as a rule stated repeatedly how they had never been a united group, merely a way <br />
of thinking: however, they now found themselves frantically pulling themselves together <br />
and quickly shifting their philosophy from 'The gods don't exist' to 'we don't need the <br />
gods.' <br />
<br />
For older kids, this amounted to more to learn in class (the horror) of what to and what not <br />
to expect from certain life forms that were now identified as having not been fictional. For <br />
a large number of said older kids, this meant though they didn't have to pretend to be <br />
something they weren't every time they went to school or hung out with their friends. <br />
<br />
The advocate of over human overpopulation found themselves having to back to their <br />
charts. <br />
<br />
For some younger kids it was like the characters of their story book had walked off the <br />
page (in a way, the innocence of fairy tales had been lost since these kids would learn <br />
most as these races were as diverse as they themselves were) and of course for another set <br />
it was time for &quot;I knew it! I knew it!&quot; in their friend's and tormentor's faces. <br />
<br />
 Jennifer &quot;Jen-Jen&quot; fit into neither of these two categories, she had figured as much from <br />
the story told her mother and the transfiguration of her parents that such entities were in <br />
all likely hood very much real. She was of course disappointed when she learned none of <br />
her friends were mythicals in disguise. Her own friends were also surprised and maybe <br />
disappointed  when they learned Jennifer herself was not a mythical in disguise in spite of <br />
her parents being foxes. She also had to explain repeated that no, she was not adopted, <br />
though it was getting annoying to having to explain that to everyone. More so for her <br />
parents. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm very certain my daughter was -not- switched at birth thank you.&quot; Her mother had <br />
explained to more than a couple of her work buddies. <br />
<br />
When Jennifer had heard the news she was going to have a new little sibling, she of course <br />
made the European connection that her mother was pregnant, they were not Americans <br />
after all, they didn't have the same phobia surrounding sex education. <br />
<br />
Then Jennifer had said it, surprisingly the first one to say it, then again, she had become <br />
more curious about foxes given her parent's fate, but they on the other, got all the foxes <br />
they needed to see  in the mirror and each other.  &quot;How big a litter are ya gonna have?&quot;<br />
<br />
This had stopped both foxes cold. 'A litter? As in more than one?' Andrew thought his tail <br />
standing on end. <br />
<br />
Neither Charlene nor Andrew had the slightest intent of rethinking their decline to King <br />
Tommy, but the realization that Charlene might be carrying more than one kit hadn't <br />
occurred to either of them. More than that, while they had known logically that their <br />
children would be kits, it had just never been a conscious fact, rather like when Charlene's <br />
foxiness had been filtered from her co-workers.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at her parents oddly, they looked like they might have both swallowed a <br />
bug. It was hard to tell underneath that fur, but she could swear they both looked a little <br />
green. The humanoid European and fennec foxes took one look at each other and nodded. <br />
Andrew made one phone call while Charlene made another.  Jennifer wondered why no <br />
one bothered to answer her question. <br />
<br />
The next day, after her parents had succeeded in getting a expedient Doctor's <br />
appointment and had gone off to check something important, Jennifer was reminded of <br />
another disappointment, in spite of the elves, and the fae in general having ceased their <br />
performance or out right hiding, Jennifer's baby sitting as it turned out had -not- been an <br />
elf or fairy in disguise, she had simply been very good at being cheerful and knowing her <br />
way around kids as good as some parents.   <br />
<br />
Jennifer behaved herself more often than not and thus was given a relative amount of <br />
autonomy by her sitter, including being allowed to simply be in her room to her own <br />
devices. Thus she was alone in her room when a polite if slightly effeminate voice said <br />
behind her, &quot;Hello niece Jen-Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer turned around a snowy white fox with five tails with four legs laying lazily on the <br />
door frame to her room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox looked actually a bit surprised, &quot;You don't know? Geeze louise we really need to <br />
have all of us introduced to each other's families... You could say I'm your uncle, call me <br />
Akira.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Akira?&quot; She said the weird sounding name. <br />
<br />
In a puff of smoke the fox appeared next to her sounding now female, &quot;Or Akane, <br />
whichever you prefer niece. I'm you're mom's brother/sister..&quot;  Another puff of smoke and <br />
the fox was sitting up on her bed and said in a effeminate voice again. &quot;Ya know how yer <br />
mom said she was held captive by an evil king? I was one of the captives too, and we all <br />
sorte forged a bound among ourselves in that time. I came by to say hello... so... where is <br />
she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's... not here... there's just the baby sitting down stairs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; The fox hopped off the bed and circled her, tickling her with her tails, &quot;Too bad, I <br />
really wanted to say hi... still... it would be impolite for me to visit all the way from Japan <br />
and not come bearing gifts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer's ears perked at this, &quot;You mean like presents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly like presents, or more like a present.&quot; The fox assumed a sitting up stance in front <br />
of Jennifer on her carpet. &quot;I heard that you're having some confusion about people <br />
believing your mom and dad are your mom and dad... nothing wrong with being adopted <br />
mind you, but there's no reason to go around with people always making that mistake... <br />
and I can understand how you can learn that magic is real but it still doesn't directly relate <br />
with you.&quot;  In a puff of smoke again a little charm appeared on one of the fox's tails. It <br />
looked like a necklace with a little gold chain perfect for Jennifer's size and had a little <br />
blue, red and yellow singular gem in the center and three little gold spokes evenly going <br />
out from the gem. Jennifer noticed the gem had a purple facet in the center. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a gift to my new niece... in this case meaning you.&quot; The fox smiled. Jennifer <br />
reached for the necklace of Akira pulled it back. <br />
<br />
&quot;You said it was mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said this is a gift for you. I thought about it, and I thought about it again, and I realized I <br />
couldn't make up my mind about which gift to give you, so I chose to break the rule of a <br />
surprise gift to let you decide.&quot; He began to sway his tails moving the necklace along with <br />
it, Jen-Jen kept her eyes on the prize. &quot;If you look into the blue side of the gem, you'll see <br />
a reflection of yourself as a fox boy: you'll fit in with your parents, you'll be special with <br />
your friends, you'll fit in with any kits your parents will have. All you need to do is look <br />
into any of the facets and say 'This is me' out loud while consciously and willingly looking <br />
at any facet of the gem for the spell to take effect and you'll become the way you're <br />
reflected in the facet. If you look into the red facet, you'll see yourself as a kitsune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a kitsune?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A magic fox with lots of tails like me. You'll have magic, you'll be more than a little unique <br />
around you're friends, you'll still be a girl, until you get your magic down enough to <br />
illusionary shape change in a few decades and it'll be more up to you though at you're <br />
core you'll still be a kitsune no matter what. You'll also find having fun a lot LOT easier as <br />
one....   If you look into the red facet, you'll see yourself as.... you seen CardCaptor Sakura, <br />
MewMewPower or Sailor Moon?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Jennifer said with pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that makes this easier, looking into the red facet you'll see yourself as a magical <br />
girl. You'll look mostly like you are now, but a bit cuter and prettier with fox ears and tail <br />
to boot! For that form the necklace will become your transformation Item, appearing and <br />
vanishing from your person at your whim. With none of these choices will you be able to <br />
become one of the other forms later girl, so remember that.&quot; Akira included that warning <br />
mostly cause he knew that Charlene would buy a ticket to japan, buy some sutras, and <br />
personally turn him into a throw rug if he didn't... and she was family after all... like Keiko <br />
said. &quot;You'll be able to ditch the fox features while in 'non-magicial' form, but you'll keep <br />
the cute pretty look mostly. What magic tricks you're able to perform and how potent your <br />
magic becomes if you chose the red facet depends greatly on -you- and how the magic <br />
reacts with you. Even I can't predict how it'll turn out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do I get to have you as my Magical Pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira actually shuddered at that idea. &quot;Familiar girl, the proper term is Familiar, and nope, <br />
sorry, not gonna happen, don't count on it, but you'll find one soon enough or one will <br />
find you given how magic's no longer in the closet. Now, after you use this baby, you <br />
won't be able, like I said, able to go back and chose one of the other forms... but.. as an <br />
extra added bonus, if you think you'll ALIENATED your friends by changing yourself, I <br />
grant you, absolutely free, this special trick. You and a friend of yours, and it has to be a <br />
friend, just don't ask me to define friendship, just have to hold the necklace at the same <br />
time, and you say intentionally and willingly 'This is you' and they'll take on the same <br />
changes as the ones you chose for yourself. Be that fox gender flop, kitsune, or magic <br />
semi-fox kid, though of course for the last one you'll remain in the lead of any 'magical <br />
girl club' you form. Like you, they'll be no reverse switch.' Akira knew this last bit might <br />
cause some havoc, but he was a kitsune for crying out loud! If he didn't do at least a <br />
LITTLE chaos for each good deed he might actually go SANE!   <br />
<br />
&quot;Look girl, I know you were worried about yer mom back when she was yer dad, and she <br />
got taken away by a very bad man, but if you want, you can with the third choice be able <br />
to protect your friends and family maybe from some of the things that go bump in the <br />
night. This won't be for ya chasin' robbers with guns, got it?&quot; Akira's eyes actually flashed <br />
color for a moment as he said the last part.<br />
<br />
Jennifer nodded. &quot;What does the purple part do if I look into it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira laughed, &quot;That's... a secret... it won't reflect anything... but if you do look into it and <br />
say the magic words, all the previous rules apply to the form you get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't gonna tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see if you have the trust, or the courage, to take a risk...you're gonna find in life <br />
sometimes it'll be a matter of choosing the unsure thing sometimes... for us Kitsune the <br />
unsure thing is always the sure thing. Jake Fox Boy. Junko the european kitsune. Jen-Jen <br />
magical girl? What shall it be niece? This one belongs to you alone little girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
Akira dropped the necklace into the little girl's hot little hands. &quot;You're auntie Keiko let <br />
your mom become your dad, so they could be happy together... consider this my way of <br />
seeing you're happy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen held up the gem and looked at it.</p>
