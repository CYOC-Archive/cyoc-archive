<br />
Aaron ran across the rooftops of the bustling city he decided to visit while he thought things over. He had hoped that when he returned to his own home realm, he could just go back and everything would be right with the world, but of course, things were never that easy in his life. When he arrived back about an hour or so ago, a young female demon hunter took chase after him, forcing him to run. Over the last few hours, the pair exchanged gunfire and physical blows as Aaron attempted to flee. He managed to at one point get onto a rooftop and the rogue hunter chased after him until at last they ran out of roofs for them to race along. Aaron turned around and took a fighting stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never wanted to hurt Caleb Moreland, please you&#39;ve got to understand, what I did was an accident.&quot; Aaron said to the young hunter who looked to be carrying a few too much arsenal on her person. It seemed like she was someone who was in over her head with this, thinking she would move up in the world of demon hunting doing this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m aware. Moreland himself even called off the ransom for you. But I can&#39;t help but enjoy a good chase, too bad it has to end here, I would&#39;ve loved for it to go on for a little longer.&quot; The rogue hunter said as she prepared to aim her crossbow that she had on her arm at Aaron and fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Caleb called it off then what the hell are we doing up here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The hunter said nothing, Aaron grunting in annoyance. One moment an attractive woman his age was talking to him, the next she was trying to kill him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this because I told you I have a girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could fire her weapon, she was struck from behind, collapsing in a heap on top of the roof unconscious. Aaron was surprised to see his Uncle Fukushu standing behind the woman<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid immoral human.&quot; Fukushu grumbled aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle! How...how did you find me?&quot; Aaron asked, surprised that Fukushu managed to him at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;After you left the kitsune realm, Chisai informed me you had stayed at his residence and left. I had assumed you had fled to your home, but didn&#39;t sense you there. I was able to catch your scent to this location and I found you here against this despicable hunter.&quot; Fukushu explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I was going to have a long drawn out fight with her or something until you showed up.&quot; Aaron commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;A rogue demon hunter going after a magic user? That&#39;s an old and long story that doesn&#39;t need repeating. Don&#39;t worry about her, she&#39;s only unconscious. I&#39;ll return her to the church so she can face her consequences, but only after you and I have a few words.&quot; Fukushu said as he sat on the ledge of the roof and motioned for Aaron to come have a sit with him.<br />
<br />
They look down to see people down in the streets doing last minute holiday shopping, lovers kissing under a mistletoe, children excited to see a Santa Claus in the street, and others playing in the snow.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a time like this where it is accustomed for people to be....what&#39;s the word Haley told me? Merry as it were. So nephew, why are you not as merry as those people down there?&quot; Fukushu asked as Aaron as he looked over at Aaron, but Aaron didn&#39;t look back at him and instead looked down at all the people.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t deserve to be happy this year uncle. I let Caleb down, I hurt him and in the process I yelled at Nyx because I was so freaked out that I had nearly killed him.&quot; Aaron explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nyx? Now where have I heard that name recently? Oh yes, now I remember. Abolith visited your home recently, she told me that she met your girlfriend Nyx there. She had gone to meet your family by herself.&quot; Aaron looked over at Fukushu for a moment with a surprised look on his face before shaking his head and turning back to look at the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Nyx is at my house?&quot; Aaron asked. &quot;Also, what is Abolith doing hanging around my place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked her to...keep an eye out on the family after everything that has transpired,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;However, she seemed eager in accepting my request. Regardless from what she told me, the rest of your family seems to really like her, she&#39;s even staying with them for the time being. I believe she&#39;s waiting for you to return, as is the rest of your family.&quot; Aaron shook his head, surprised to hear what lengths his family was willing to go yet still weighed down by guilt.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I just....I just....don&#39;t know uncle. I don&#39;t know if I can face them just yet. My loving mothers, my caring sisters, my young brother who practically worships me. Nyx, the girl who....the girl who I...hope still loves me, even after all the horrible words I said to her. I haven&#39;t spoken one word to them for days, I made them all worry for so long. I don&#39;t even know what the first thing I would say to them would be? Maybe I should be more like you and keep my emotions bottled up.&quot; Aaron scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nephew, I know you have insecurities about yourself. But you should never strive to be me.&quot; Fukushu said as Aaron just sighed and nodded his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you missed much that transpired during the civil war in the kitsune realm,&quot; Fukushu began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I heard that Kari, Haley, and even Mason are being regarded as war heroes now. Mason, my own little brother helped save the entire realm. I&#39;m sure grandma and grandpa are proud of them. I don&#39;t know what Tatsu and Shizen would even think of me after what I did.&quot; Aaron thought aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;They would still love you, I know that all to well. But Lord Tatsu and Lady Shizen, had their doubts, as did I that some so-called &#39;prophecy&#39; would predict that as it said: &#39;In a battle of Gods only those that walk between two worlds shall stand victorious.&#39; Not in my lifetime would I predict that My nieces and nephew would spare....her.&quot; Fukushu said not wishing to speak Hinata&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you just come here to praise my siblings?&quot; Aaron asked raising his eyebrow at his uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that wasn&#39;t where I was going. I had actually spoken with your brother, he reminded me how...important it is to open your heart to others. It came to the point where after the war ended, Abolith and I decided that Raiden and Stella should see you and your siblings more. So now, if you ever decide to visit the kitsune realm again, you can get to know Raiden better. I&#39;m sure you and he would become great friends.&quot; Fukushu explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason really impacted you that much?&quot; Aaron asked surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe how much he reminds me of my youth when I was....I was...a far different kitsune. But when I see you now, it reminds me of the kitsune I became and that&#39;s why I&#39;m telling you this now: Aaron, please, I...I beg you, don&#39;t become like I once was. I don&#39;t want any of you, not my children, not Mason, and especially not you to turn out like me.&quot; Fukushu said, his face a mask of pain. &quot;The world doesn&#39;t.... need another Fukushu, it needs someone like you, Aaron.&quot; Fukushu said as he turned away, sighing heavily before he turned back to Aaron after composing himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;My advice to you now, nephew, is this: go home. Go to your family that have missed you and your loved one, and if you feel it&#39;s necessary, ask them for forgiveness.&quot; Fukushu said as he and Aaron stood up on the roof. Aaron was then surprised when Fukushu embraced him in a hug to which Aaron now slowly hugged back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merry Christmas to you nephew.&quot; Fukushu said almost as a whisper to him as Aaron gave a smile.<br />
<br />
Fukushu grabbed the young rogue hunter and hauled her over his shoulders to drop her off at a church for her actions against Aaron. Aaron looked back down at the street to see an older man embracing who he assumed to be his parents and then his younger brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time to go home.&quot; Aaron said to himself with a nod.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Not far away, at the O&#39;Toole-Kirkman house, Mason Harris and Fenrir were visiting with the family. Stephanie and Travis were also there too, to give the family a gift they didn&#39;t specify yet, but wanted to wait until Anjelica and Mason had exchanged their gifts. Mason&#39;s gift to Anjelica was a pink pocket knife for her protection.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you might&#39;ve wanted something like jewelry or something like that, but I thought I would give you something to protect you.&quot; Mason explained rubbing his neck shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, thanks Mason, I love it.&quot; Anjelica said kissing her boyfriend on the cheek making him blush as Anjelica&#39;s mothers and sister found the moment adorable.<br />
<br />
Anjelica now gave Mason a gift of her own and handed a box to him. Mason opened it to see that it was a compas with a Nordic symbol on the back of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll match with your sword, and....also help to find your way around, because we kind of did get turned around a little back in the kitsune realm.&quot; Anjelica chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Anjelica, and when I use it, I&#39;ll be thinking of you.&quot; Mason thanked as Anjelica leaned her face over for Mason to kiss it. He did, but a little hesitantly as he was still a little shy about doing it in public, even if it was in front of Anjelica&#39;s family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Moms, my gift to you this year isn&#39;t that big. But it is special, open this card.&quot; Stephanie said as she handed her mothers a Christmas card which they were a little confused about.<br />
<br />
&quot; Let&#39;s see...&#39;Sorry we didn&#39;t buy you a gift, but we thought we&#39;d give you something better that you could smother. How would you like it, if both of you were to become a....grandmother?&#39; OH MY GOD! ANGEL, OUR BABY GIRL IS PREGNANT!!!&quot; Jackie shouted just as excitedly as Ann as they hugged each other and gave Stephanie a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to be an aunt?! Wow, I can&#39;t believe it! Congratulations sis.&quot; Anjelica said congratulating her older sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, by next year, we&#39;ll have another little one here with us celebrating the new year.&quot; Travis said with a smile as he wrapped his arm around his wife&#39;s shoulders and gave her a kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hardly believe it myself. I&#39;m going to have a baby.&quot; Stephanie said gently touching her belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was my first thought when I was having Anjelica, but she&#39;s been our precious gift, just like you&#39;ll have your own precious gift soon enough.&quot; Ann said as she went over and kissed Anjelica on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, mother...&quot; Anjelica said with a slight bit of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations to you two, but Fenrir and I have to be getting home. My family and I are going to be giving gifts soon.&quot; Mason apologized as he and Fenrir went to the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Mason, bye Fenrir, you be a good dog now.&quot; Anjelica said scratching Fenrir behind the ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Mason, maybe next time give Anjelica a wedding ring instead!&quot; Stephanie joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie!&quot; Anjelica shouted at her sister in embarrassment as Mason and Fenrir headed out the front door.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;So Fenrir, you were telling me before that a lot of Christmas stuff was around before there was a Christmas?&quot; Mason asked his dog holding onto Fenrir&#39;s leash, which the family had gotten for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many traditions are long gone now, but yes, some traditions remain. A yule log, wreaths, and mistletoe, such as the one Anjelica had you stand under when you arrived at her home earlier this evening.&quot; Fenrir explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know we&#39;re....kind of dating right now, but we haven&#39;t exactly had our first date yet. I wouldn&#39;t even know where to go or what it should be? Dinner? A movie? A stroll in the park? Maybe I should ask Aaron? Whenever he comes back home that is.&quot; Mason said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother seems like a complicated individual, why do you look up to him so much if he seems insecure with his own girlfriend?&quot; Fenrir asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose it&#39;s just because I grew up in a house with mostly girls and he was the only boy in the house. I saw all the amazing stuff he did, and when I grew up, I wanted to do a lot of the same stuff he did, because....well, my brother is my hero, and I love him for it.&quot; Mason answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also have admiration for my own siblings, wherever they are.&quot; Fenrir said as he and Mason came near the house and they saw Kari and Haley sitting with Nyx out on the porch.<br />
<br />
The girls gave a wave and greeting to Mason and Fenrir as they entered the house. The girls were looking up at the sky looking at the stars.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;ve read up on constellations,&quot; Kari recalled to the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh here we go, miss by the books wants to teach us something when everyone&#39;s out of school like usual.&quot; Haley sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, come on, it&#39;s fun to look at the stars, but it&#39;s also neat to learn the names of the constellations.&quot; Kari explained. &quot;I believe there are two constellations that touch with each other. But I can&#39;t remember what they&#39;re called.&quot; Kari said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll look it up.&quot; Nyx said as she got out her phone. &quot;Okay let&#39;s see the two constellations that touch each other are Perseus and.....Andromeda. Heh, oh that&#39;s rich. Seems like even the fucking stars want my sister to be happy on Christmas and not me. Wait, what does my name mean?&quot; Nyx suddenly wondered as she looked it up again on her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddess of the night? I&#39;m named after a goddess?&quot; Nyx said with surprise in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s cooler than my name. I think mine was like a hay meadow or something when I looked it up.&quot; Haley said as Nyx got up from the porch and walked into the front yard and stared up at the sky facing the Harris house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, universe, do you hear that? I&#39;m named after a goddess!&quot; Nyx shouted to the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cry out to the universe, but the universe like a boy I know doesn&#39;t seem to care.&quot; Nyx sighs as she looks back up at the stars again and a tear runs down her face.<br />
<br />
Nyx then looked at the porch to see Kari and Haley have surprised looks on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Nyx asks the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I care.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nyx gasped, quickly wiping her eyes before turning towards the voice. As she gazed at the figure, she felt an odd mix of anger, shock, and concern. &quot;YOU!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry. Now, can you please listen. There&#39;s something I need to say.&quot; Nyx scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This better be good,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I messed up I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Nyx raised an eyebrow at him for this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? no shit.&quot; Nyx replied, a scowl forming on her face as she lightly slapped Aaron on the face. &quot;You idiot! You save me from Caleb, then yell at me and blame me and up and vanish?!&quot; Aaron said nothing, glancing at the ground as he scuffed his foot against the ground.<br />
<br />
Haley and Kari couldn&#39;t help but watch the scene with the two of them play out as they wondered how this would go for the two of them, Nyx was obviously working through her emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nyx..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you Nyx me,&quot; she yelled. &quot;After everything we shared, everything we talked about. I told you everything that&#39;s ever happened to me! I shared secrets with you that I never told ANYBODY! And then you vanish like a fart in the wind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right and I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Aaron sighed. &quot;Now can I explain or are you going to keep hitting me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk! Then maybe I hit you.&quot; Nyx said crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
Aaron sighed, raising his head slightly. He never was very good at opening up to anyone, but if he was to make Nyx understand he couldn&#39;t hold back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I did....It broke me,&quot; Aaron sniffed and now Nyx could see his eyes begin to dampen. &quot;I love Caleb like he was my father. He cared for me, taught me, looked out for me. He&#39;s always said how proud he was of me and I almost killed him because I couldn&#39;t let him hurt you. I....I love you Nyx. I love you more than I thought I would ever love anyone. And I feel like by doing that I betrayed Caleb. Nyx, can you ever forgive me what I said to you?&quot; Nyx had tried to remained stone faced, but tears were welling in her eyes now as she jumped into Aaron&#39;s arms and embraced him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I forgive you, you idiot, how could I not? I&#39;ve loved you more than any other boy that I&#39;ve ever known!&quot; Nyx shouted through happy tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear it, and I think I owe you something.&quot; Aaron said as Nyx looked confused for a moment, before Aaron gave her a passionate kiss on the lips. Something he had actually seen from Chase and Andromeda. Haley and Kari watched as Nyx raised up one of her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moms! Mason! Aaron&#39;s back!&quot; Haley said as she went to open the door to the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go inside, I think your family will be happy to see you.&quot; Nyx said she held Aaron&#39;s hand as they went to the front door.<br />
<br />
Aaron went inside and was immediately greeted by his mothers who wrapped their arms around him and kissed him lovingly as Aaron smiled. Then Kari and Haley gave their brother a hug, as did Mason, who was trying not to cry and be a man happy that his older brother was back. Aaron was a little surprised when a dog licked his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....when did we get a dog?&quot; Aaron asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story short: we found him in the kitsune realm, he&#39;s a dog of Norse origins, Fenrir. He and I formed a bond, and can fuse into a hybrid wolf thanks to that sword I found.&quot; Mason explained to his big brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, anything else?&quot; Aaron asked surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can speak, if that surprises you.&quot; Fenrir said as Aaron did look surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, not the craziest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; Aaron said as Mason then remembered something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir, I just remembered, I got you a gift, it&#39;s a collar with your name on it. &#39;Fenrir Harris&#39;, you&#39;re part of the family now.&quot; Mason said as Fenrir licked his young master&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;A gift? Oh! Nyx, I&#39;ll be right back, I actually have something for you.&quot; Aaron said as he ran to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope it&#39;s not a dog collar!&quot; Nyx said as the rest of the Harris family laughed.<br />
<br />
Aaron came back soon and brought Nyx a small box which Aaron nodded for her to open and she gasped when she saw what was inside the box: a silver locket necklace with a birthstone oval on the front of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Aaron, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Nyx said as she took it out of the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and open the inside of it.&quot; Aaron said as she looked inside to see her name engraved on one side and Aaron&#39;s on the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so even when we&#39;re apart, you&#39;ll always have me with you.&quot; Aaron said as Nyx sighed a little in disappointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it, I do, it&#39;s just....I wish I could give you something in return.&quot; Nyx said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seein you at my doorstep was enough of a Christmas gift.&quot; Aaron said as Nyx gave Aaron a tender kiss on the lips. He then helped place the necklace around her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, everyone, how about a family photo? I need a nice photo of all of us together to celebrate Aaron being back.&quot; Claudia said as Kari, Haley, and Mason made their way over to where Mika was setting up her phone&#39;s camera to take a picture.<br />
<br />
Aaron was making his way over, when he turned around to see Nyx looking a little shy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t you want to be in the photo too?&quot; Aaron asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I...I really shouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s your family photo after all.&quot; Nyx said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense Nyx, after all these days you&#39;ve spent with us, you&#39;re already part of the family.&quot; Mika said as Nyx smiled at this and went over to Aaron&#39;s side who stood next to Mika as Haley and Kari stood on the other side of Claudia, while Mason and Fenrir were in the front of the photo. It would be a memorable photo for all them to look back on years later.</p>
