<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg grit his teeth. He&#39;d had enough of this small dicked loser trying to boss him around like he was some sort of alpha. Really, the kid didn&#39;t know his place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you,&quot; he muttered into the phone, and ended the call.<br />
<br />
He glanced back at the man who&#39;d been feeling him up a minute before, but he had moved away — peering at the back of the bus, Greg could see that he&#39;d found a seat. That, or else he&#39;d taken it from some guy with a smaller package. Greg slumped a little at the realization that his bus ride was going back to normal, but his mind soon moved on to other thoughts. Why had that Jason kid been so worked up over the book, anyway? He hadn&#39;t even written anything that scandalous, at least not for someone who&#39;d already seen the kid had a small cock. Was he afraid Greg was going to show the book to other guys? He frowned, and let his mind explore the possibilities as the bus took him the rest of the way home.<br />
<br />
-—<br />
<br />
When Greg made it to his apartment, he went straight to the bedroom, and opened the book, ready to jack off. Looking over the words he&#39;d written about the way the world worked, though, he felt a memory stir. Something Jason&#39;s landlord had said. What was it? Calling the book Jason&#39;s &quot;little fanfic,&quot; or something. Suddenly, Greg found the idea of writing &quot;little fanfic&quot; like this indescribably hot. He quickly grabbed a stray pen from his bedside table, mouth watering at the idea of replacing the dry words in the book with some kinky fantasy of his own. He –<br />
<br />
Huh. Hang on. That was odd...Greg knew that he hadn&#39;t gotten the idea to write something new in the book before now, but, nevertheless, he got the most overwhelming feeling of deja vu at the thoughts he&#39;d just had. Shrugging, eh shook the feeling off, and got to thinking about how he would improve the dull workaday reality he lived in if he had the chance.<br />
<br />
His mind wandered to his encounter on the bus — if he was writing out his perfect fantasy world, one thing was for sure. Men like that wouldn&#39;t just walk away. Greg toyed with the idea of writing a story where all men were attracted to small penises, but something about the idea felt wrong. As much as he was embarrassed and ashamed at how small he was, the idea of making himself any bigger or lessening the humiliation instantly turned him off. He bit his lip. No baby-dick liked to admit it, but he&#39;d talked to some of his college friends one night, drunk out of their minds, and they&#39;d all admitted they secretly liked getting called names and pushed around. With that conversation in mind, Greg made a decision, and got to work writing out his first try at erotica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Small-dicked men have an almost irresistible urge to follow any sexual orders given by a man with a big cock, and instinctively follow most other orders too unless they would cause physical harm. Once other men discover that a guy has a baby-dick, he is treated like a human sex toy. Public sexual acts involving men with baby dicks are not considered taboo in much of the developed world. Men with small dicks will generally try to hide them for as long as they can, since they find public exposure and submission equal parts humiliating and arousing. Despite this, many small dicked men enter relationships or contracts where they are forced to wear reveling clothes in public, or otherwise debase themselves in a public manner. Women have no interest in small-dicked men, and sex with them is generally viewed more like using a fleshlight than cheating, especially since they are immune to STDs. Dick size is directly correlated to confidence and dominance, and negatively correlated with embarrassment, shyness, and submissiveness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finishing the last sentence sent a thrill up Greg&#39;s spine. Even writing in such a dry scientific way somehow made the experience that much hotter. He leaned back in bed, and closed his eyes as he began to jack off to mental images of hung studs forcing him to take their dicks in public, completely oblivious as, in front of him, the book glimmered and absorbed this new change.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
(Back to Jason&#39;s POV, and first person since most of it is written that way)<br />
<br />
I swore, throwing my phone down onto my bed. First Greg had taken the fucking book, now he wouldn&#39;t give it back. That phone call hadn&#39;t come cheap, either...I could still taste the cum of every male tenant on my floor coating my lips. Larry had been an asshole before, but whatever Greg did had taken it to a whole new level. There was something exciting, hot even about the feeling of cum still coating the inside of my mouth, splattered across my face, but I had to shower. Shaking the horny thoughts from my mind, I walked into the bathroom and turned on the tap.<br />
<br />
What had Greg changed? He&#39;d probably made himself more hung, the jerk. Whatever he&#39;d done to me had made me nearly throw myself at Larry the instant I saw his cock — fuck, even the thought of how big it was made my dick twitch below the running water. That had to have been one of his changes too. Most of the other guys in the building had been larger than I expected...<br />
<br />
I took much longer than usual with the shower — I kept having to stop and turn the tap to cold, since whenever I started to lather my dick the sight of how small it was sent a thrill of arousal all the way through me. When I finally got out, the sun was noticeably lower in the sky. How long had I taken?<br />
<br />
I pulled on some clothes, careful to select my baggiest boxers and thickest pair of jeans. For whatever reason, I felt more worried than before that someone would notice how small my dick was. Fuck, what would they do to me if they found out? I groaned despite myself, trying and failing to fight off the unfamiliar fantasies of humiliation. I had to pull myself together. After the long shower, I was now painfully aware that, besides what felt like a gallon of cum, I hadn&#39;t had a bite to eat. I cursed myself internally for not stocking the fridge more regularly. Now I had to go out in public if I wanted to get groceries.<br />
<br />
Bracing myself, I opened my front door. Noticing how the idea of walking out in public sent a shiver down my spine, I suddenly wondered whether Greg had changed something else...</p>
