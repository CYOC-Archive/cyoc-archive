<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After hanging up on her husband, Melissa Stovall could not deny the longing within her heart.<br />
She missed Martin, more than what she was willing to admit.<br />
<i>Monday OR Tuesday. Wish he could of pinned it down more, but then again, as head of Stovall Systems, there&#39;s no rule that says I can&#39;t take BOTH days off if absolutely necessary,</i> she thought, already planning the welcome home she would give him once her husband returned.<br />
How to tell Martin that their only daughter was now officially engaged, as far as were-mer society was concerned, was another matter; but she&#39;d swim that stream when the time came.<br />
<br />
AT THE ACTUAL MOON LAKE...<br />
Alex Ramsey and his boyfriend Nate Anderson swam and played most of the afternoon in the cool waters of the town&#39;s namesake, until they finally realized that the sun was about to start sinking below the tree line.<br />
With that, they swam to shore and grabbed their towels. But as Alex started drying himself off, he found himself suddenly grabbed by Nate, who hugged and embraced his boyfriend before giving Alex a gentle peck on the lips.<br />
&quot;Not that I&#39;m complaining, but what was that for?&quot; he asked, staring deeply into Nate&#39;s brown eyes.<br />
&quot;Just because handsome. I&#39;m having a great time and I never want moments like this to end. Especially when they&#39;re with you,&quot; replied Nate, before kissing Alex again.<br />
&quot;I feel the same way stud,&quot; agreed Alex, kissing his lover in return. &quot;But we also need to gather some more firewood and kindling so we can get ready for tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what happens tonight?&quot; asked Nate, with a sly smile on his face, without letting go of Alex.<br />
&quot;The same thing that happens every night you big lug,&quot; was the reply, before Nate received a peck on the cheek. &quot;Now let&#39;s go get that wood,&quot; suggested Alex, managing to break away from his boyfriend.<br />
<i>I&#39;ve got one piece you certainly can have later,</i> silently thought Nate, not wanting to spoil the moment, while trying to adjust his swim trunks when Alex wasn&#39;t looking.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
As werecat Martha Anderson and werevixen Dawn Hale were helping each other put the finishing touches on dinner, they heard someone coming down the backstairs. A quick sniff confirmed it was Dawn&#39;s werefox husband Douglas. Like the ladies, he had stayed in his fursona as he rejoined them.<br />
&quot;Hi honey. Have a good nap?&quot; asked Dawn, as the two weres embraced each other and kissed.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he replied with a smile on his muzzle. &quot;That was one hell of an afternoon. Any plans for tonight?&quot; asked Douglas, as he briefly eyed the sexy ass of Martha, who had her furry back turned toward them at the moment.<br />
&quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; was all Dawn could say, because while the Hales were more than willing to continue the impromptu orgy, and she suspected William Anderson would be more than willing to share both her and his wife, Martha had yet to agree to a true foursome, and so the swinging foxes played it cool.<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m assuming everyone&#39;s worked up a big appetite, because Dawn and I managed to whip up one mighty large meatloaf,&quot; replied Martha, turning to face the Hales again, unaware of their thoughts.<br />
&quot;I know I&#39;m so hungry, I could probably finish it all by myself,&quot; said William Anderson, as he came down the backstairs. Yet, unlike the others, he had changed back into his human form and was now wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and flip flops.<br />
&quot;What? Did I miss something?&quot; he asked, confused because the others were still all furred up.<br />
&quot;Dawn was explaining to me earlier about the joys of experiencing other stuff as a were besides sex,&quot; said Martha, as the werecat snuggled up to her husband.<br />
&quot;Oh? Like what?&quot; wondered William.<br />
&quot;Anything we would normally do around the house or outside, as long as we keep the curtains closed and don&#39;t go out furry in public before dark,&quot; said Martha, after kissing William.<br />
&quot;Sounds interesting. Tell me more,&quot; he requested, even as William started stripping and releasing his werefox again, an act both Dawn and Martha took great interest in.<br />
<br />
NEXT DOOR...<br />
Even without the mayor on family leave to take care of his mother, it had been a VERY long day for Town Chancellor Samantha Twist. All she wanted to do when she got home was curl into the loving arms of her wife Frances and stay there the rest of the weekend.<br />
As she entered the home she shared with Frances and their son Ben, Samantha was surprised to see her wife sitting at the dining room table, pouring over some books.<br />
&quot;Hey honey,&quot; said Frances, looking up at her mate and noticing her frazzled expression. &quot;Rough day, huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. I could use all the TLC you can spare,&quot; replied Samantha, kissing the top of her wife&#39;s red hair. &quot;What&#39;s all this?&quot; she wondered, sitting down next to Frances.<br />
&quot;Ben and I got to talking before he had to get ready for his date with Kenya tonight,&quot; she explained, while Samantha looked at the stuff on the table.<br />
&quot;This I recognize,&quot; replied Samantha, looking over the photo album of Elizabeth Franklin&#39;s known but missing art. &quot;But who did these?&quot; she asked, flipping through the closest sketchbook.<br />
&quot;Ben.&quot;<br />
&quot;REALLY?&quot; said Samantha. &quot;I didn&#39;t know he draws. Oh my,&quot; she added, after studying a few pages. &quot;I hate to say this, but he might even be better than Elizabeth.&quot;<br />
&quot;That thought crossed my mind too. He told me today that after high school, Ben wants to go to Moon Lake College and study to be a professional artist.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just like Elizabeth,&quot; was all Samantha said, as she continued looking through the sketchbook in her hands. When finished, she asked, &quot;What else did you two talk about?&quot;<br />
&quot;I told Ben it would be okay for him to still live here while he furthered his education.&quot;<br />
&quot;No problem. Did you two talk about college expenses?&quot;<br />
&quot;A little. I only told him that Elizabeth and Fred were already saving up for that when they died, and that we continued it afterward, so Ben wouldn&#39;t have to worry about the costs.&quot;<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t say anything about the exact amount that&#39;s currently in his college fund?&quot; asked Samantha, a bit concerned.<br />
&quot;No. After all, we don&#39;t know how Fred and Elizabeth managed to save almost a million dollars for that before their death,&quot; replied Frances.<br />
&quot;Personally, I believe it had something to do with Fred&#39;s job at Tachibana.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Ben said when he was getting career advice at the college yesterday, Mrs. Johnson said she was under the impression Fred had something to do with making the were birth control pills more species specific.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mrs. Johnson is still there?&quot; asked Samantha in disbelief. &quot;Even for a were, she was there when we went to college.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, anyway, I also promised Ben the three of us would go through the stuff in the storeroom together sometime. The trip to the college has got him asking questions about his history, but that&#39;s something we should do as a family,&quot; said Frances.<br />
Samantha agreed, &quot;But right now what I really need is a couple of aspirin and you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Let&#39;s go to the bedroom. After the aspirin, you can kick off your shoes, lay in bed with your head on my lap while I massage your temples, and you can tell me all about your day,&quot; promised Frances, as she stood up, took her wife&#39;s hand, and led her to the master bedroom.<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Samantha with a smile, looking forward to the time alone to relax and destress with the one she loved.</p>
