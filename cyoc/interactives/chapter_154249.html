<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the mistress wove her spell, James couldn&#39;t stop the flurry of questions a fears that arose in his mind. He knew now that Elspeth&#39;s magic was real, but was it actually possible to transform a living being into an inanimate object? She had said he would retain consciousness, but what did that mean without eyes or ears to sense the world around him? How was this possible?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic.&quot; Elspeth said, suddenly, clapping her hands together. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t look at me that way, dear. Of course I can hear your thoughts now; I&#39;m about to turn you into a chair! How else do you think I am going to monitor your well-being? Now, just sit back and relax!&quot; with this she flung her clasped hands in his direction, and though he couldn&#39;t see anything fly through the air, he *felt* her magic wash over him.<br />
<br />
A tingling engulfed his entire body, and immediately, with two large drops, James realized he was shrinking! ... but, no, that wasn&#39;t right... He looked down and saw that it was only his legs that had shortened. His bare feet too seemed to different, and as he watched, his toes shrunk into each foot, which in turn pulled back towards his ankles, rounding as they went, forming into small, brass-colored wheels! His ankles shifted, the ends forming into swiveling metal joints; where his ankle bones had protruded was now a pin connecting his leg to the wheels his feet had become.<br />
<br />
His wheeled appendages suddenly rolled forward, causing him to lose his balance abruptly. His arms windmilled as he fell backward, but time seemed to slow and he found it easy, almost natural-feeling, to catch himself with his hands behind his back. With an audible *snap,* James felt his hips and shoulders lock into place, and he realized it was now impossible to move any of his limbs. Stuck in an awkward, crab-like position, he could only slightly feel something happening to his hands and wrists, and he could only imagine they were succumbing to the same fate as his feet and ankles.<br />
<br />
With his naked pelvis and torso facing the ceiling, James felt even more exposed than earlier. The tingling of Elspeth&#39;s magic was still racing over his body, and he worried what those tingles might be doing to his groin. He raised his head, craning forward to look down over his chest and abs, trying to catch a glimpse of his member. <br />
<br />
He heard Elspeth snort, and raised his gaze to his mistress. &quot;Men.&quot; she huffed. &quot;Always so worried about such a small part of themselves!&quot; she rolled her eyes and turned to leave the room, satisfied that her spell would complete the job without her supervision. &quot;Just get comfortable, James, and don&#39;t worry about such insignificant details!&quot;<br />
<br />
With an airy wave of one hand, she turned the corner. James could ear her footsteps receding, but as they grew fainter and fainter, the sound took on a strange, muffled quality. Almost as if someone was holding a pillow over his ears. Vibrations registered, but he realized he could no longer hear Elspeth, or the fire that had been crackling happily in the grate, or the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. His eyes whipped around the room, flitting from one thing to another as he realized he would probably lose his vision shortly. <br />
<br />
Suddenly he noticed that there was a large mirror leaning against the wall in front of him. He hadn&#39;t noticed it before because it was mostly concealed by a side table, reflecting only what was underneath or level with the tabletop. Shock filtered through him as he saw what had become of him so far: he still, for the most part, resembled a naked man, bent over backward into some yoga-like position. His crotch was front and center at this angle, and he could just see his head peeking over his flattened torso. His back was locked, and his chest and hips smoothed out, his human lumps, bumps and muscles disappearing as his body became a flat plane, parallel to the floor. <br />
<br />
His view of his changing body was quickly becoming clearer, and he raised his eyes to the mirror to see that his neck was elongating while also broadening. His ears flared out, puffing up until they resembled long elephant ears, or... the framing sides of a wingback chair, perhaps? His neck, now the width of his head and still expanding, continued to stretch upwards at a ninety degree angle from his torso, stopping only when it reached the breadth of his shoulders. His face had stretched outward too, matching his neck and looking incredibly grotesque with his facial features enlarged and stretched to match. His ears drooped further, meeting his shoulders and then running along the side of his torso, the long lobes forming &quot;arms&quot; for his almost completely chair-like form.<br />
<br />
His limbs were still so spindly compared to his filled out upper portion, but as he watched, the skin of his groin and between his former legs and arms began to expand and lower, filling in the space and forming a more substantial seat. He thickened there too, becoming more square as his hips widened and his torso shortened. Somehow still able to see, James watched as his testicles lowered to the base of the seat, smoothing out slights into two decorative swirls of wood, framing the bottom edge of the chair. His penis had shrunk, forming another paisley-like carving at the center of the wood trim.<br />
<br />
Feeling his cheeks inflate, he raised his gaze to the seat back, watching as it became stuffed and comfortable-looking, his nose having smoothed out and disappeared completely. His mouth shivered and swirreled, fading into a subtle pattern as other shapes and curlicues rose around it. James blinked one final time before his eyes too dissolved into the abstract fabric, still flesh colored with darker pink accents. Upon seeing the chair, one might call it salmon, or a pale coral before sinking down into it&#39;s soft, cushy seat and back.</p>
