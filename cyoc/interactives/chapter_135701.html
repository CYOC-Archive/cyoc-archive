<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryce and Cameron waited patiently for someone on the crowded beach to challenge them. They’d destroyed that couple a few moments earlier and wanted to show off their Fraternity’s power. There had to be some guys from DeVry that wanted to one up them but for some reason no one was asking.<br />
<br />
“Come on just ask someone,” Cameron ordered while crossing his arms. Bryce gazed around the beach until his eyes fell on two guys sitting cross legged under a beach umbrella playing with one of those lame card games that dweeby basement dwellers enjoyed playing. Bryce didn’t even hesitate to pick up the vaolleyball and whip at the guys with lightning speed. It whizzed through the air before smacking into one of the pudgy losers and knocking his glasses right off his face. He fell forward as Bryce stalked up to them. He stopped when his shadow was over the geeky losers and he leered at them.<br />
<br />
“You guys are going to play some volleyball,” Bryce stated while a broad grin spread across his face.<br />
<br />
“Sports aren’t exactly our forte,” the dweeb with a substantial amount of acne on his face commented. Bryce just grabbed him and his face contorted into fear. A mere minute later the two of them were opposite Bryce and Cameron on the court, standing shaky legged and awkward. The guy with glasses was a pudgy looking neck beard who couldn’t even pull off the beard part. His partner was an abnormally skinny kid with curly red hair, a rat stash, and so many pimples his face couldn’t even hold them all so they went down his back, chest, and arms. They were both already sweaty and out of breath so Bryce knew they were not going to be beaten by these guys or have any attention taken off them.<br />
<br />
“Heads up!” Cameron shouted before serving the ball. It just flew between the guys and smashed into the sand so hard it sent the grains into the boys eyes. They helped and rubbed them while Cameron and Bryce laughed.<br />
<br />
“This was a bad idea,” The chunky boy named Bernard commented while lowering his hands. His eyes were now a beautiful amber colour but no one seemed to notice.<br />
<br />
“He’ll kill us if we dip out now,” His partner, Jesse, replied while lowering his own hands and revealing his eyes were now a stark green colour. Beautiful and clashing with his clearly under nourished body.<br />
<br />
Jesse kicked the ball back to Cameron and he spun it on his finger before leaping into the air and hitting it hard. Bernard moved to bump it but it hit the ground in front of him and both boys let out a sigh, neither realizing their voices had suddenly cracked. Now they sounded like girls. Bernard had a deeper tone than Jesse but they both had feminine voices that actually sounded pleasant now.<br />
<br />
The third strike actually hit Jesse. It crashed into his chest and bounced onto the ground over to Cameron again. Jesse scratched his now A-Cup breast while Bernard failed to realize his waist had popped out into feminine proportions. Cameron served again and smacked Cameron right in the boobs. His A-Cups swelled to a B-Cup while Bernard’s ass inflated to sexy and feminine proportions. Bryce chuckled and elbowed Cameron who repeated the strike. Suddenly Jesse had C-Cups while Bernard’s thighs increased in size. Cameron seemed to enjoy this too much because he repeated the hit again and Jesse stumbled backwards now sore and sported D-Cup breasts while Bernard’s fat and pudgy belly shrunk inward.<br />
<br />
Jesse just managed to avoid the seventh hit and it hit the sand hard. Both boys yelled as their waists caved in giving them hourglass figures. They gave each other looks of determination and Cameron spiked the ball again and for the first time Jesse actually bumped it and proceeded to yell in pain as it sailed over the net and was bumped, set, and spiked right onto the sand between them. Jesse’s hips popped out into childbearing levels while Bryce shrunk a few inches. They panted sweatily before Bernard grabbed the ball and rolled it back to Cameron. The pro server leapt into the air and spiked the ball. It collided with Bernard’s head causing his glasses to fall off. He reached down and picked his sunglasses up before perching them back on his nose. Meanwhile Jesse stumbled as his ass inflated adding more to his off balance half female body.<br />
<br />
“You guys make it too easy!” Bryce laughed as the volleyball hit the sand between Bernard and Jesse once again.<br />
<br />
“How about you give us girls a little bit of an easier time,” Jesse replied with a glare as both boys had their genitals slurped into their bodies replaced with female plumbing.<br />
<br />
Cameron’s response was to spike the ball again and cause Jesse’s feet to shrink and A-Cup breasts to pop into existence on Bernard’s chest. Both girls growled in annoyance before Jesse tossed the ball to Bryce who tossed it to Cameron. The ball was served and Bernard managed to bump it but it sailed out of bounds. Her breasts swelled to B-Cups while Jesse’s thighs expanded to rather alluring levels giving her a curvy look.<br />
<br />
The next serve went better. Jesse managed to bump it to Bernard who set it. Then Jesse went to go spike it but Bryce jumped over the net and made her flinch backwards. He then denied her and spiked the ball down to the sand. Jesse’s shoulder’s caved inwards while Bernard’s body hair fell off leaving his skin smooth and flawless. Cameron’s next serve was bumped but right into the net so Jesse’s hands shrunk to a dainty level while her arms began to match her body’s new proportions.<br />
<br />
Jesse managed to bump the next hit over the net and the boys hit it back and forth before spiking it. Jesse dove down to stop it but it bounced off her arms and out of bounds. She hit her head into the sand and when she rose it her lips had puffed up. Bernard meanwhile had her shoulder cave in. Both girls had stinging forearms by the next set. They bumped it twice each instantly costing them a point as only three hits were allowed. Both girls groaned. Jesse’s acne cleared up until it was all gone during their collective groan and Bernard’s hands shrunk. The guys just seemed unbeatable and this feeling only intensified after Bernard’s hair grew from her head flowing down to her shoulders and tying itself up in a tail while Jesse’s body hair flakes off.<br />
<br />
“We need to get it together,” Jesse growled as Cameron served again. They bumped it over the net and the boys set things up. Bryce spiked it and Jesse managed to save it. However she slid into the ground and Bernard couldn’t quite hit it over the net so she ended up bumping it twice in a row losing them a point. Jesse’s nose shrunk while Bernard’s hair turned blonde after this occurred and they both took ready stances as the ball sailed through the air. They bumped it, set it, and then spiked it, right out of bounds.<br />
<br />
Bernard’s face restructured itself into that of a sexy female while the kinkiness of Jesse’s hair faltered and the red locks fell around her face in a wavy pattern. Both girls were panting and sweaty by this point and Cameron’s next serve proved to be back at step one. The twentieth point for the guys made both girl’s swim trunks shrink into bikini bottoms while bikini tops formed around their breasts. Bernards’s Was bright blue while Jesse’s turned black. Bernard lifted her sunglasses as they stared at the cocky boys across the net one point away from clean sweeping them.<br />
<br />
“We can do this,” Jesse whispered before Cameron served and they both ran for it. But instead of hitting the ball they smacked into each other and fell, the ball landing between them. Jesse’s hair shot down her back, wavy and red while Bernice blinked and sighed.<br />
<br />
“Well sports aren’t exactly our forte,” Bernice laughed while Jesse got to her feet and helped her friend up.<br />
<br />
“Good game,” Jesse commented before turning around.<br />
<br />
“Uh uh uh, remember our deal,” Bryce replied while shaking his fingers. Jesse sighed and turned around reaching for her Niki top strap. She undid it and her much shorter friend did the same. A few moments later four breaths popped loose of their confines as the girls flashed the winners. The boys hooted and hollered happily before the girls hid their breasts again and walked away feeling soreness climbing in their arms. Bryce and Cameron exchanged a high five while the girls returned to their blanket. Jesse laid down sexily while Bernice sat cross legged and picked up some cards.<br />
<br />
“Okay, my thistles snare traps your fuegofly...” Bernice started.</p>
